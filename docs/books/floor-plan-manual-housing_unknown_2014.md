5 Working with the Floor Plan Manual Housing  
The Floor Plan Manual Housing is designed as a workbook. It  
documents and analyzes 161 international housing projects  
built since 1947. Its compact presentation of all projects, the  
range of the projects and the long time period covered by the  
selection of examples make the Floor Plan Manual Housing a  
tool for researching the latest developments in housing, con-  
textualizing these developments through comparison with  
examples from the past 70 years. The systematic typological  
presentation of the projects allows readers to utilize the  
knowledge and ideas of others in a purposeful manner, thus  
finding inspiration for one’s own work on floor plans.  
A number of instruments in the book help provide an  
overview while offering focused approaches to reviewing  
the wealth of material. Thus, depending on one’s mood or  
particular interest, different ways of using the book are made  
possible.  
APPROACH  
A  
The chart on the inside cover or insert  
The navigation aid on the inside book cover \(soft cover  
edition\) or on the insert \(hard cover edition\) provides a  
systematic overview if you wish to search the collection of  
examples for specific floor plan ideas, access and circulation  
form, or for projects from a specific architectural practice.  
The chart categorizes the projects alphabetically from top to  
bottom by practice name and from left to right according to  
floor plan organization and means of access \(cf. essays “The  
Floor Plan Idea”, pages 48–53, and “The Path toward Access  
and Circulation”, pages 42–47\).  
APPROACH  
B  
Table of contents and introductions to typological groups  
PAGES 4–5  
The table of contents \(like the project section\) organizes  
the projects according to urban and morphological building  
types, each organized in its own chapter. Every chapter, in  
turn, is prefaced with a brief text describing the building type  
and the resultant demands for the floor plan. In this way, one  
can search and better compare the relevant projects for a  
given design task.  
APPROACH  
C  
The analytical essays  
PAGES 8–57  
The project section is preceded by six fundamental introduc-  
tory essays, whose various focal points provide the reader  
and user with different possibilities to review and analyze  
floor plans. \(see below\: “The essays as working instruments”\)  
APPROACH  
D  
Floor plan diagram overview  
PAGES 60–69  
The overview of the floor plan diagrams of all examples can  
also be used as a visual table of contents\: it allows the eye  
to travel and is intended to inspire a fresh look at the floor  
plans beyond the specific building tasks, names, or comple-  
tion dates. One of the aims of this volume is to highlight the  
surprising and inspiring elements of floor plans, which at  
first glance often go unheeded as irrelevant or uninteresting.  
6  
The project selection  
The focus of this documentation is on floor plans; therefore  
all key floor plans \(or an exemplary plan for each project\) are  
presented at the same scale of 1 \: 200, thus enabling easy  
comparison. A north indicator at the bottom of the page  
identifies the orientation.  
The projects are documented as a whole, by means of sec-  
tions, site plans, small photographs as visual supplements,  
systematic additional information in the margins, and  
written descriptions. The descriptions fulfill a dual role\: they  
are intended to guide the reader through the house or apart-  
ment; they also attempt to summarize the plan’s underlying  
idea, thus freeing the reader from the concrete floor plan  
and inspiring him or her to form a personal interpretation of  
the concept.  
The same is true for the diagrams, which in their abstrac-  
tion – that is, the standardized presentation of an exemplary  
floor plan – allow the idea of the floor plan to become more  
evident and therefore comparable to others in the book. All  
diagrams are shown as figure-ground plans. The white area  
shows the open, undefined areas to better illustrate the  
spatial flow, while the black areas denote spatial boundaries  
and predetermined zones such as bathrooms and storage  
space. All diagrams are drawn at a scale of 1 \: 500 and located  
at the top left corner of the first project page. Like a flipbook,  
they serve as a complementary search aid throughout the  
project section. Working with the Floor Plan Manual Housing  
With regard to the project plans, we have retained the  
mode of representation chosen by each architect, for the  
design idea is always reflected in the visual language of the  
presentation.  
Within each chapter, the projects are organized chrono-  
logically, in order to better trace the development of each  
building type.  
The Floor Plan Manual features only built projects, although  
an argument could undoubtedly be made that unbuilt pro-  
jects would be equally enriching for the design of floor plans.  
However, it was important that all projects "pass through  
the eye of the needle” called realization before a serious  
comparison can take place, because floor plan design is  
often subject to significant modification during the building  
process.  
Emphasis was placed on a broad international scope of the  
selected projects in order to better reflect heterogeneous,  
worldwide developments in housing.  
In addition to the objective selection criteria, a further stipu-  
lation was that each project selected is based on “exemplary  
floor plans.” In our view, an exemplary floor plan is first and  
foremost distinguished by a good or excellent utilization  
of the given situation. Secondly, and equally important, is  
that the specific idea for a floor plan should be expressed  
with the greatest clarity possible, independent of whether  
the concept could be and indeed is applicable to all or only  
a small group of users. For the most part, we have selected  
universally applicable, easily transferable solutions, although  
it also seemed justified to include, here and there, several  
designs too unique to serve as references in other settings.  
The essays as working instruments  
The introductory texts provide the reader with various op-  
tions for analysis. They demonstrate that one can only do  
justice to the complexity of what so prosaically is referred to  
as housing by layering different "ways of seeing."  
The introduction “The Sweetness of Functioning is Archi-  
tecture\: On the Use of Floor Plans” focuses on the various  
ways of reading floor plans in general, whereby reading/use  
signifies the study and development of drafting the floor  
plan on the one hand and living in or making use of the built  
plan on the other. By shedding light on both of these “levels  
of reading,” the text reveals the inherent sensuous nature of  
the seemingly abstract housing floor plan.  
The “Chronicle of Developments in Housing” documents sig-  
nificant developments in housing from the industrialization  
in the 19th century to the year 2000. Its linear, chronologi-  
cal nature allows one to retrace the multifaceted parallel  
development of historic turning points, significant paradigm  
shifts, and newly developed buildings or building types cre-  
ated as a reaction thereto or creating new impulses.  
The chronicle is complemented by a description of diverse  
“Challenges and Tendencies” in the global development of  
housing in recent years as we observe them today – without  
the benefit of hindsight.  
The focus then shifts to the organization of the structure of  
a house, the ways in which the apartments are connected to  
one another and to their surroundings\: “The Path toward  
Access and Circulation” describes the significance and poten-  
tial of the access space and analyzes different access types.  
The publisher and the editors would like to thank all those  
architects who were kind enough to search for the plans –  
and the data – of buildings long completed. They deserve  
the merit for the accomplishment of an international  
“Floor Plan Manual Housing.”  
The typology of the apartment, the search for the idea that  
underlies the specific arrangement of its individual rooms  
and their relationship to one another – be it linear, around a  
center, merging, or separate – is outlined in “The Floor Plan  
Idea.”  
While the “Floor Plan Idea” provides an analysis of built  
examples and suggests working with floor plan types as a  
design method, the essay “A Graphic Approach to Floor Plan  
Design” proposes methods of an abstract, graphic nature to  
first develop design intentions regarding spatial, functional,  
or social criteria without confining them to a concrete archi-  
tectural form too early in the process.  
The Floor Plan Manual Housing continues to be a work in  
progress. Thus we would like to once again issue an invita-  
tion to all readers and users of this manual who feel that a  
project they deem especially important – be it their own or  
a project created by someone else, old or new – is missing  
from this selection\: please contact the publisher at www.  
birkhauser.com and share your knowledge for the next  
revised edition of this work.

# “The Sweetness of Functioning is Architecture”\:  
# On the Use of Floor Plans  
By prefacing the term functioning with a set of sensations  
and employing the word “sweetness,” Alison and Peter  
Smithson show the work of designing a floor plan in a dif-  
ferent light. As architects who felt committed to modernism,  
they never questioned the necessity of functionality, which  
would after all be unthinkable in housing with its complex  
functional requirements. Yet they never relied solely on the  
functionality of the built structure; rather, they based their  
arguments on the pleasure of physically sensing that and  
how a house does function.  
“… the light and the space and the air are one. Sniff the  
air, sense the space, know how to act.” This expands the  
perspective\: from working on a floor plan as an abstract  
and uninhabited concept to considering what the floor plan  
will become once it is in use. And conversely, how the work  
on a floor plan can be inspired if the person who designs it  
embraces all possible facets of use\: the joy of exploring the  
potential of the floor plan, of resting in and moving through  
the space, and of engaging with the particular characteris-  
tics of a house – be it the sensory experience of its rooms  
or the manner in which they connect the inhabitant to his  
surroundings.  
Ways of Reading  
In his essay “Figures, Doors and Passages,” the architec-  
tural theorist Robin Evans also explores the relationship  
between floor plans and their use by inhabitants. To this  
end, he compares the plans for two villas, one by John  
Webb, the other by Andrea Palladio. His description focuses  
less on the floor plans as such than on two different ways  
of reading them.  
In John Webb’s design for Amesbury House in Wiltshire  
\(1661\), the use to which the house is put seems secondary,  
Ambient light, ambient air, no fuss about detail, awareness in a quiet way that the  
sweetness of functioning is architecture. … In a real building, the light and the space  
and the air are one. Sniff the air, sense the space, know how to act. How to keep this  
sense of what is going on – where the light and air is coming from, how to get in and  
out …, that is the question…  
A. + P. Smithson, in\: Changing the Art of Inhabitation, London, Munich, 1994

for the architect has already anticipated and predetermined  
it in the plan. According to Evans, the process of industriali-  
zation and the separation of living and working led to the  
provision of privacy becoming the definitive topic in the de-  
bate on housing. The instrument of this intimacy is not the  
occupant of the house, but the house itself. Thus the plan  
for Amesbury House features a corridor and a two-tiered  
stairwell, which regulate all movement. In this case, the plan  
becomes a mechanism, capable of guiding its inhabitants to  
specific modes of behavior. One way of reading, therefore, is  
to test the spatial layout for its functionality and the system-  
atic separation of private and public zones.  
Such rules drove the design of floor plans in housing for a  
long time and, in addition to other factors, led to the extreme  
determination of floor plan structures. And this trend was  
further advanced during the modern era in particular, when  
the pursuit of economy and rationality led many architects  
Andrea Palladio\: Palazzo Antonini, Udine, 1556 “The Sweetness of Functioning is Architecture”\: On the Use of Floor Plans | Oliver Heckmann  
to such functional and apparently logical solutions. The use  
of the house has only little relevance when verifying its func-  
tionality. The functions are predetermined to such a degree  
as to eliminate any surprises in the subsequent use.  
In the second example cited by Evans, the Palazzo  
Antonini in Udine by Andrea Palladio \(1556\), the floor plan is  
only comprehensible through the history of how it was used.  
Evans uses a literary reference \(a chambermaid was asked to  
guard one of the many rooms, thus temporarily separating it  
from the spatial continuum, in order to ensure privacy for a  
tête-à-tête\) to explain that floor plans of this kind are greatly  
dependent on the ability of the occupants to control their  
boundaries. For all rooms in this plan are directly linked to  
one another as parts of an open sequence of spaces; they  
are equal in terms of structural prominence and are entirely  
indeterminate with regard to function or placement. Even  
the lavatories are connecting spaces.  
\[Architecture\] during the last two centuries … is employed more and more as a  
preventive measure; an agency for peace, security and segregation which, by its very  
nature, limits the horizon of experience – reducing noise-transmission,  
differentiating movement patterns, suppressing smells, … veiling embarrassment,  
closeting indecency and abolishing the unnecessary; incidentally reducing daily life  
to a private shadow-play. But on the other side of this definition, there is surely  
another kind of architecture that would seek to give full play to the things that have  
been so carefully masked by its antitype; an architecture arising out of the deep  
fascination that draws people towards others; an architecture that recognizes  
passion, carnality and sociality.

and Other Essays, London, 1997  
Riegler Riewe\: Bahnhofstraße, Graz-Straßgang, 1994  
Polyvalence  
Thus the second way of reading operates on a completely  
different level. The reader speculates what may take place  
because the floor plan does not provide any clues as to what  
should take place. The indeterminate nature of the floor plan  
of the Palazzo Antonini turns out to be polyvalent\: the poten-  
tialities of use are established, but only come to life through  
reading and using. In their residential building, Riegler Riewe  
have turned polyvalence into a design principle – not in the  
sense of Palladio, where it emerged more as a byproduct of  
his open, predominantly representative spatial order, but  
as a structured, very controlled and well-researched floor  
plan, whose numerous links between rooms of similar size  
allow for particularly diverse interpretations and functional  
allocations.  
The activities of the residents were taken into account  
here. Instead of preemptively assigning each space a specific  
function such as living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom  
and office, bathroom and WC, shared scenarios were devised  
in which the users relax, come together or seek out privacy,  
eat, cook, sleep, work, or wash and relieve themselves. The  
degree of interconnectedness between the rooms appears  
to be the most important aspect, as if the functions of the  
floor plan can only emerge once a spatial disposition of the  
volumes has been precisely arranged. Polyvalence, in working  
on a design, means creating spaces so rich and dense that  
they can be interpreted and occupied in a variety of ways.  
Similarly, the floor plan for the Minus K House is com-  
posed of a homogenous matrix of equal-sized rooms, whose  
intended use is only hinted at through their linkages – either  
axially, on their sides, or diagonally with open corners to  
create larger areas.

9 Peter Märkli with Gody Kühnis\: Residential Building, Trübbach, 1989  
Offer  
In Peter Märkli’s houses, functionality seems to play a subor-  
dinate role in the floor plan. He generates spatial tensions in  
his floor plan compositions and avoids anything that might  
be read as static and unambiguous; he allows the space to  
flow, creating the basis for the most varied forms of use. In  
his residential building in Trübbach, the apartments are or-  
ganized by means of three volumes set off from one another  
and the middle wall. The kitchen is inserted and forms an  
entryway together with the loggia on the other side, while  
a fireplace at the far end of the room defines yet another  
locale by virtue of its corporeality and orientation. A sanitary  
core, around which the internal paths seem to circulate, is  
set back from the facade on the other side of the middle  
wall. There is no hallway or corridor. The subtle rhythmiza-  
tion of the areas – small-large-small on the entrance side,  
and large-small-large on the other side – evokes a flow of  
movement that blurs the boundaries and functions of the  
individual rooms, a quality that is further enhanced by the  
cohesively continuous facade. Although the floor plan estab-  
lishes certain guidelines, it nevertheless remains  
polyvalent. The reader can promenade through such draw-  
ings as if on a virtual tour, measuring open spaces and  
defined areas of use, all the while speculating and deciding  
on how the house can be used.  
Even more extreme are use-neutral and semi-finished  
buildings like the Kölner Brett by the architects b&k+  
brandlhuber&kniess. The occupant is not only asked to  
establish a relationship with an existing spatial composition,  
he or she is even called upon to envision and then carry out  
its completion. This places a greater emphasis on use as an  
act of design. More than just reinterpreting the reading of a  
floor plan, here it remains to be completed.  
To begin with, the building is use-neutral and the rooms  
are empty. The drawing of the spatial configuration is no  
more than an abstract system. Spatial manipulation, a link-  
age of flat, yet wide and tall, albeit narrow spaces, options for  
horizontal and vertical connections all contribute to form a  
spatial conglomerate, which offers sufficient density in any  
imaginable constellation.  
Although the built units are empty and undefined, they  
are not devoid of atmosphere, for the concept, which is  
entirely diagrammatic to begin with, is defined by materiality  
and sensuality. Exposed concrete, massive oak planks, and  
tall wooden doors, which block the view behind the glazed

facades at precisely those points where one walks through –  
all these elements define the character of the house. Given  
the emptiness and lack of definition, the occupant can seize  
upon these elements as a starting point of orientation.  
Discretion  
Evans’ comparison between the floor plans of Webb and  
Palladio leads to another design question\: was the guid-  
ing principle the separation or rather the connection of  
residents when the floor plan was being developed and its  
walls drawn? For instance, the categorical demand for the  
respect of privacy in the Amesbury House can be more subtly  
laid out in the floor plan design without such a strict spatial  
determination. An occupant who is able to connect with the  
space is also able to recognize openly formulated boundaries;  
the floor plan design may thus rely on the occupant’s  
ability for discretion. Alvar Aalto’s plan for a residential  
building in Berlin’s Hansaviertel is particularly impressive to  
study, because such a balance is achieved\: the focal point of  
the unit is clearly the idea of an open living room, – which  
he dubbed “the market square” – as the intersection of all  
movement. However, the rest of the apartment is so tact-  
fully organized that no one ever feels too exposed. One of  
the doors to the private rooms is obscured by an equally  
wide support pillar, and to reach the others one first has to  
turn a corner; the dining area is part of the living room but  
formulated as a protected niche behind a wooden screen,  
thus slightly separated.  
In House O, in which open spaces for living, eating,  
cooking, washing, and sleeping are all accommodated in a  
single large room, the branches in the floor plan point to the  
intimacy of individual areas – simply by virtue of preventing  
direct sightlines. The bed only comes into view after one has  
changed direction several times; the connection is delayed  
but not interrupted.  
The residential units of SL Court are organized as split-  
levels and it is likewise not walls, but here the subtly offset  
levels that produce a feeling of safe distance. Only the bed-  
rooms in the middle are given additional translucent sliding  
elements. One single space flows openly throughout the unit  
without completely dissolving the borders of the individual  
areas, enabling dense living in close proximity.

Pleasure  
In the drawings “Small Pleasures of Life,” Alison and Peter  
Smithson sketch an outline of how plain use can become  
a true pleasure. They cite the places where occupants can  
take possession of the house and explain how the house as  
a whole is enriched by the subtle definition of these places.  
Their observations seem to be rooted more in the experi-  
ences of an occupant who knows how to enjoy amenities like  
these than in the functional knowledge of an architect.  
It must be noted that the highly specific window open-  
ings, in particular, are functionally predetermined in their  
sketches\: they are arranged to direct the sightline and to  
clearly define the position of the inhabitant. There are spaces  
for sitting and looking outside, just as there are spaces for  
introspection. Rooms are not defined and delimited as din-  
ing room, bedroom, or kitchen; rather the architects extend  
an invitation to settle down in specific areas. And although  
one of the areas may be suitable for sitting on a sofa, that is  
by no means an indication that this space has been exclu-  
sively defined as a living room.  
Alison and Peter Smithson’s Sugden House is similarly  
distinguished by this kind of spatial definition of locales and  
the finely calibrated treatment of boundaries and transitions.  
This begins with the earth wall and the bench along its edge,  
which mark the ground level of the house. The house seems  
to have several entrances, giving equal value to all sides. The  
narrow metal sheets above the lintel seem to mark rather  
than shelter these entrance doors. The brickwork that sur-  
rounds the openings enhances the corporeal integrity of the  
house. In the interior, these openings inspire specific uses  
and activities; the inhabitant is connected to the outside  
world in different yet always unique ways.  
In the house, the subtle treatment of the details char-  
acterizes the atmosphere of the whole. Take, for example,  
the additional step by which the bedrooms are raised\:  
this gives them even greater privacy, while the living room  
below benefits from a higher ceiling and thus gains a  
greater spatial presence. The fireplace and the stairs define  
the large common area on the ground floor. At the same  
time, they also divide the large room and create a sense  
of shelter for the occupant rather than feeling “exposed”  
in a single large space. The bottom of the staircase is  
positioned in a manner that allows just enough space for  
lateral movement, while suggesting the path down the  
middle of the living room.

A. + P. Smithson\: Sugden House, Watford, 1957  
Although the floor plan is far from undetermined, it  
allows for great flexibility and the house thus achieves a  
balanced relationship between predetermined function and  
possible use. The design for the Sugden House “anticipates  
the matters of living,” as Martin Steinmann\* writes. The  
house seems to be imbued with a profound knowledge of  
what makes habitation enjoyable and how use makes the  
house into a home.  
Similarly, Rudolf Olgiati’s Witzig House could have served as  
a motif for Alison and Peter Smithson’s sketches in that it is laid  
out with such a sense of comfort and scenic spaces, offering its  
inhabitants places for enjoying the surroundings. The funnel-  
shaped view from the dining area, the large window overlook-  
ing the valley, the sculptural cut-out window combined with a  
bench for taking in the mountain in one direction and facing  
the fireplace in the center of the room in the other direction\:  
these spaces alternate between opening up expansive vistas  
and appearing enclosed and introverted. Occupants naturally  
use houses of this kind in a very intuitive manner.  
Such floor plans require readers who take pleasure in  
deciphering their distinctive features. When encountering ir-  
ritations or blank spaces, the question “how is this supposed  
to function” should be an expression of curiosity rather than  
a mere commentary.  
This book addresses questions of this kind. Ultimately,  
the Floor Plan Manual Housing also provides an opportunity  
to read potential ways of living into the numerous examples  
it presents. The reader can peruse all the floor plans in this  
book, reading them simultaneously in a critical and curious, an  
analytical and imaginative manner. Even as bedtime reading.

# A Chronicle of Developments in Housing  
This timeline chronicles significant developments in housing  
from the industrialization of the 19th century to the year 2000.  
The passage of time appears to be the best nexus to visualize  
concurrent historical turning points and paradigm shifts, as well  
as buildings and newly developed building types emerging as  
a reaction thereto, or with the capability to set new standards  
around the world.  
Paternalist Workers Settlements/New  
Building Type\: Row Houses  
As an alternative to the generally miserable  
living conditions in the big cities – partly  
built for philanthropic reasons, and partly  
out of the fear of workers’ riots –  
industrial workers settlements were  
realized in the immediate vicinity of  
production centers. The predominant  
housing types were row houses arranged  
in village-like layouts – often with garden  
plots to grow food to consume or sell as  
a source of supplementary income. The  
housing units in such settlements made  
a significant contribution to the develop-  
ment of the row house as a building type.  
Workers Settlements/Row House  
1850–1863  
Saltaire, Bradford \(UK\) – Titus Salt \(owner\)  
Settlement with row houses and communal facilities – built  
to the southwest of the factory to minimize exposure to  
harmful pollution.  
Workers Settlements  
1859  
Familistère, Guise \(FR\) – Jean-Baptiste André Godin  
An ensemble of three buildings in an axial formation was  
designed and also cohabited by the owner of the nearby  
factory. Besides covered courtyards, which could be used for  
community events, other amenities included a kindergarten,  
school, bathhouse, and theater. Godin’s ensemble followed  
the model of the Phalanstères as postulated by the utopian  
Charles Fourier, which had a deliberate resemblance to the  
palace at Versailles and proclaimed a cooperatively  
organized, collective vision of living and working.  
Urban Housing Shortage  
At the beginning of the 19th century, the  
industrialization led to an unprecedented  
migration of job seekers from rural regions  
to the factories in the rapidly growing cities  
in Europe and North America. Specific ur-  
ban milieus arose, with the proletariat and  
the prosperous bourgeoisie in extremely  
different housing types and locations. In  
tenements developed on a massive scale,  
miserable living conditions were often the  
norm. Berlin’s building code of 1853 had  
yet to define the apartment as an enclosed  
entity. Instead, rules determined the maxi-  
mum allowable occupancy for individual  
rooms – single rooms with shared bath-  
rooms and kitchens often accommodated  
entire families. For the most part, singles  
rented only a place to sleep.  
14 A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
With the industrialization and the growth  
of cities, specific housing types arose for  
the urban bourgeoisie as well. Initially laid-  
out with palace-like suites of rooms and  
built for the upper class, more specific so-  
lutions in smaller units were developed for  
the growing middle class – with represent-  
ative sequences of rooms along the street  
and, in many cases, separately organized  
entrances and areas for servants.  
New Building Type\: Apartment House  
\(USA\)  
The row house dominated the streetscape  
of American cities until the early 19th  
century. A tenfold increase in the urban  
population between 1830 and 1870 led to  
rising land prices. Thus, despite a general  
distaste for multifamily dwellings, so-  
called “French flats” were introduced and  
by 1875 regarded as an acceptable residen-  
tial model for the middle class. Over time,  
these buildings expanded in size to cover  
entire blocks and were equipped with  
luxurious inner courtyards, penthouses and  
roof gardens in order to appeal to more  
wealthy segments of the population.  
Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
Approx. 1870  
Casa Blocco, Via Assarotti, Genoa \(IT\)  
This building type emerged from the tradition of city palaces  
for wealthy families and was adapted to an urban,  
multi-story residential construction for the middle class.  
The two apartments per floor are laid out with similarly  
sized rooms partially offset to one another, revealing an  
almost use-neutral floor plan organization.  
Apartment House/Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
1870  
The Stuyvesant Flats, New York \(USA\) – Richard Morris  
Hunt  
Manhattan’s first multifamily dwelling had a two-part  
circulation core – with a main staircase for residents and a  
second for servants. While the representative rooms looked  
out over the street, a long corridor led to the rear of the  
building, where narrow courtyards provided the private  
chambers with some daylight.  
Urban Housing Shortage  
1870  
Perleberger Strasse 14, Berlin \(GER\)  
Common building type for working families, with shared  
kitchens and WCs on the intermediate stair landings.  
1889  
Humane Housing Standards  
Shortly before the advent of modern  
architecture, ideas on social reform led to  
improved living standards for the working  
class throughout Europe. While in England,  
private enterprises and philanthropic  
foundations operated freely in the market  
economy, in 1889, the Société Française  
à Bon Marché in France and the German  
Cooperative Law established the pillars for  
more humane living conditions.  
Workers Settlements  
1879  
Bournville, Birmingham \(UK\) – George Cadbury \(Owner\)  
Spacious semi-detached house type in a workers village  
with recreational facilities, schools and its own train station.  
Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
1897  
Brückenallee 4, Berlin \(GER\), Apartment Types for the  
Middle Class  
In essence, most block edge residential buildings in Berlin  
are morphologically similar, with a load-bearing middle wall  
parallel to the street facade and a front and rear building  
with side wings. They often housed residents of diverse  
economic standings under the same roof. The wealthy  
looked out over the street, low-paid workers into generally  
dark courtyards. Apartments for the middle class and  
substantially larger ones for the wealthy were equipped with  
separate circulation routes for servants – with their own  
staircases, hallways, and wings; the living areas of the  
wealthy were linked in open enfilades.  
1897  
Apartment House/Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
1890–1930  
Chicago courtyards \(USA\)  
The organization of a U-shaped building around a courtyard  
open to the street became a typical convention for  
numerous, primarily three-story apartment buildings  
following the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Double-loaded  
staircases are accessed directly from the landscaped  
courtyard, which serves as a semi-public transition from the  
street to the individual units.

Approx. 1900  
Bassena House Building Type, Vienna \(AT\)  
In Vienna, the building code permitted the development of  
85 % of a building site. The development of the Bassena  
House – named after a washbasin located in the hallway –  
at least provided each one-room family unit with its own  
kitchen in an anteroom.

Humane Housing Standards  
1902-08  
Herne Hill Peabody Estate, London \(UK\) – Darbishire,  
Wallis, Wilkens  
Developed as an inner-city housing type for working  
families, five 1–3-room apartments with shared bathrooms  
and washing rooms on each floor form a rational and  
cost-saving spatial principle, which was implemented in  
numerous residential buildings by the Peabody Trust over  
the following 40 years.  
Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
1903  
Rue Franklin, Paris \(FR\) – Auguste Perret  
One of the first residential buildings erected in reinforced  
concrete. The living areas are generously linked to form an  
enfilade, the kitchen and servant staircases remain  
separate. Above the commercial ground floor, the building is  
U-shaped in order to bring in more natural light.  
1902  
Garden Cities of To-morrow, Ebenezer  
Howard  
In light of miserable urban living condi-  
tions, a visionary idea designed to create a  
symbiosis between the advantages of rural  
and urban life. In a scheme of concentric  
rings, garden cities surround a central city  
beyond a green belt. The population is  
limited – if exceeded, further garden cities  
supplement the urban group. This influen-  
tial model was implemented only in terms  
of typology \(and drastically changed\),  
while the economic and social strategies –  
simple building methods, collective forms  
of ownership, and the prohibition of land  
speculation – slipped into obscurity. The  
concept was influential above all in the  
later development of New Towns as well as  
suburban, single-family house settlements.  
Garden Cities/Row House  
1906  
Hellerau Garden City \(GER\) – Riemerschmid, Muthesius,  
Tessenow

house type with three rooms, an eat-in kitchen and annex  
with WC, stall, and laundry room. A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
City Expansions  
Large-scale city expansions helped allevi-  
ate the housing shortages. Influenced by  
contemporary social debates, considerable  
improvements in living standards were  
followed, such as the provision of public  
parks and community facilities as well  
as more modern apartments – spacious  
layouts for families and units specifically  
designed for single households – with  
much consideration given to the quality of  
light and air circulation.  
City Expansions  
1917–1925  
Amsterdam Zuid \(NL\) – H. P. Berlage  
Berlage’s second master plan for the expansion of  
Amsterdam placed important public spaces and buildings  
as accents at the junctures of the main axes flanked by long  
residential blocks. In order to achieve a mixed balance of  
residents, diverse apartment types were created – including  
minimal apartments for singles – in the slim, individually  
articulated buildings with large interior courtyards.  
Apartment House/Housing Types for the Urban Bourgeoisie  
1907  
Belnord Apartments, New York \(USA\) – Hiss and Weekes  
Occupying an entire city block, a massive cubic volume is  
organized around a spacious semi-public courtyard with a  
landscaped garden inspired by European models. The  
apartments are divided down the middle by a generous  
hallway space\: representative living rooms \(and servants’  
quarters\) are oriented toward the loud street, the sleeping  
quarters toward the courtyard.  
Garden Cities/Row House  
1908  
Letchworth Garden City \(UK\) – Unwin & Parker  
A self-sufficient estate incorporating areas for farming,  
industry, a park and a residential quarter laid out in a  
star-shaped formation. The diverse row house types are  
remarkable for their shallow depth and dually oriented rooms.  
Urban Housing Shortage  
1906  
National Hotel, San Francisco \(USA\)  
“Rooming houses” were developed to fill a niche in the  
real-estate market\: cell-like units are organized around light  
and air shafts and share a bathroom. In these buildings  
intended to house temporary renters, common shared  
spaces were reduced to an absolute minimum in order to  
maximize profits.  
Affordable Housing  
After World War I, economic crises and  
egregious housing shortages in Europe led  
to the vigorous pursuit of cost-effective  
mass housing solutions. The ration-  
alization of production methods and a  
principally economic view of floor plan  
organization, building types, and their  
ensembles with the aim of standardization  
governed the debate on housing for many  
years to come.  
Affordable Housing  
1918  
“On Economical Building\: A Contribution on Housing  
Estates” – Peter Behrens, H. de Vries  
This comprehensive study addresses, among other things,  
grouped buildings and back-to-back housing typologies in  
order to more effectively utilize building parcels. It presents  
strategies for typification and rationalization and  
encourages the use of affordable materials like concrete.  
1918  
17 City Expansions  
1919–22  
Justus Van Effencomplex, Rotterdam-Spangen \(NL\) –  
Michiel Brinkman  
As part of the development of Spangen Polder under the  
direction of city-architect J. J. P. Oud, where – inspired by  
Berlage – closed, mid-height block edge buildings were  
preferred over the garden city typology, here a symbiotic  
model was sought after. An urban block edge development  
encloses common courtyards with separate programs. The  
single-floor apartments on the ground and 2nd floors are  
accessed directly from the courtyard level, while the  
prominent, all-encompassing, and almost street-wide  
galleries on the third floor provide a second stage for  
neighborly interaction and access to the maisonette units.  
City Expansions  
1923  
Hornbækhus, Copenhagen \(DK\) – Kay Fisker  
A “reform block” with roughly 300 apartments in an urban  
expansion zone surrounds a spacious, green courtyard. The  
homogeneity of its exterior facade lends it a monumental  
character. The living rooms face the street, while bedrooms  
and the kitchen – directly linked to the garden below by a  
second staircase – overlook the interior of the block.  
1919  
Affordable Housing/Row House  
1920  
“House with One Wall,” Vienna \(AT\) – Adolf Loos  
Loos patented his construction for this economic row  
house type\: only the dividing walls between houses  
were bricked, the facades are made of wood.  
Row House  
1925  
Cité Moderne, Brussels \(BE\) – Victor Bourgeois  
The design enriches the row house typology with a jagged  
row house development set at a 45° angle. Partially linked in  
their corners, rooms surround all sides of a central hall with  
staircase – day rooms as well as the kitchen and WC on the  
ground floor, bedrooms and bathrooms on the floor above.  
Affordable Housing/Garden City  
1924–28  
Sunnyside Gardens, New York \(USA\) – Clarence S. Stein,  
Henry Wright  
Affordable housing development with simple flats and  
duplexes for families is a predecessor of garden cities in the  
USA. The layout of the estate adheres to the existing block  
structure, however, by not parceling out the individual lots,  
an open ensemble with offset buildings emerges where  
green spaces in front of and behind the houses connect to  
one another.  
18  
City Expansions  
1925  
Hufeisensiedlung, Berlin-Britz \(GER\) – Bruno Taut  
One of 17 large housing developments built in Berlin  
between 1925 and 1933 with an intentional humanistic  
approach to modern architecture, this project saw the  
combination of single-story flats in the “horseshoe” with  
row houses. At the time, the flats were of ample size \(living  
and dining room 24 m², kitchen 10 m², master bedroom 20  
m²\) and each with its own garden plot in the yard of the  
horseshoe.  
Affordable Housing  
1925  
Multifamily Dwelling – Ludwig Hilberseimer  
Rational floor plan with combined kitchen and bath, living  
room as circulation space, and cabin-like rooms.  
Row House

Kiefhoek Row Houses, Rotterdam \(NL\) – J. J. Oud  
Extremely compact, 4.20 m-wide house type for six people  
with minimal circulation space and no bathroom. A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
Building Systems  
The development of innovative building  
elements, new concepts of prefabrica-  
tion, and efficient, systematic building  
processes was influenced by many factors\:  
massive housing shortages, a fascination  
with technical innovation such as Ford’s  
new automobile production methods, new  
steel construction methods in American  
high-rises and industrial buildings, as  
well as the search for a rational aesthetic.  
According to Ernst May, the reduction  
in shape and size of building parts was  
intended to “have a beneficial impact on  
the simplicity and integrity of architectural  
design.”  
Building Systems/Affordable Housing  
1926–30  
Frankfurt Slab System, Floor Plans for the Praunheim  
Slab Type \(GER\) – Ernst May  
Over 1,000 houses were built in Frankfurt using such  
industrialized assembly methods. The serial production of  
concrete building elements and the introduction of modern  
building methods were aimed at reducing building times  
and optimizing the construction of housing, so that even  
residents with modest incomes could manage to acquire  
affordable living space. The ground floor plan in Praunheim  
– part of the “first test group in Frankfurt” – followed a  
principle similar to all residential buildings in Frankfurt’s  
housing program, in which a spacious living room is  
separated from a small, standardized kitchen outfitted with  
built-in furniture and equipment designed by Margarete  
Schütte-Lihotzky.  
City Expansions  
1927–30  
Karl Marx Hof, Vienna \(AT\) – Karl Ehn  
As an urban manifest of social housing, the blocks of this  
estate had large common courtyards with communal  
facilities such as laundry rooms, bathhouses, a library,  
shops, and restaurants. While the exterior is almost  
fortress-like in nature, the apartments are very compact and  
for the most part oriented in only one direction.  
1927  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates  
Starting in the 1920s and initiated by  
the “Deutscher Werkbund “ \(German  
Association of Craftsmen\), among others,  
building exhibitions became testimonials  
to the “Neues Bauen” movement, which in-  
troduced Modernist architectural concepts  
– until then only discussed in international  
avant-garde circles – to the wider public.  
Together with model estates, they became  
an instrument of planning and building  
culture, which with often uniform concepts  
and projects created impulses for aes-  
thetic, technical, and social changes.  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates  
1927  
Building Exhibition Weißenhofsiedlung Stuttgart \(GER\)  
– Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \(master plan\)  
In contrast to more established conventions of the time, the  
master plan called for a layout of freestanding buildings  
with flat roofs, following the topography of the site.  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates  
1927  
Weißenhofsiedlung Housing \(GER\) – Ludwig Mies van der  
Rohe  
The steel-frame construction and the neutrality of the  
facades enable flexible floor plans arranged with movable  
walls located between the load-bearing columns to create  
space for four to six inhabitants. Possible configurations  
include cabin plans with the living room as circulation  
center.  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates/Row House  
1926  
Bauhaus-Siedlung Dessau-Törten \(GER\) – Walter Gropius  
\(master plan, row houses\)  
The row house types of this experimental estate project –  
on large parcels of land with enough room for keeping small  
animals or a vegetable garden – were built using serial  
construction processes and standardization methods and  
were intended as inexpensive housing for working families.  
An increase in building costs led to a further simplification  
of the later realized type “sietö IV”\: the split-level principle  
reduced the circulation space, baths were taken in the  
laundry room.  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates/Row houses

1928  
Floor Plan Studies – Alexander Klein  
Symptomatic of Modernist pursuits of  
systematically optimized housing types,  
such studies formed an important basis  
for their standardization. After extensive  
analyses of functional processes, move-  
ment flows, the placement of furniture,  
lighting conditions, and so on, Klein  
postulated a clear division of rooms into  
three groups – living, sleeping and utility  
– whose individual functions could in the  
best case be carried out with as little over-  
lap as possible. The “Room Group” floor  
plan was presented in 1928 at the “Home  
and Technology” exhibition in Munich.  
New Building Type\: Residential  
High-rises  
The high-rise was developed in the USA  
in reaction to rising inner-city land prices  
following the Civil War. Made possible by  
innovations in steel-frame construction  
and the advent of new safety measures for  
elevators, they were initially conceived for  
commercial purposes. Around the turn of  
the century, residential high-rises emerged  
in a similar style. In part conceived as  
residential hotels to circumvent height  
restrictions for purely residential buildings,  
their shapes were for the most part derived  
from the lot structure and zoning laws.  
Starting in the late 1920s, varying models  
for different income groups led to the  
creation of both luxurious residences for  
the rich as well as inner-city housing for  
the middle class.

Radburn Estate \(USA\) – Clarence S. Stein, Henry Wright  
Howard’s Garden City concept served as a role model for the  
standardized, two-story detached homes – each with a  
garage, kitchen, living and dining room on the first floor and  
bedrooms on the second floor – arranged in groups around  
cul-de-sacs that flank a large public park. Semi-public paths  
connect the streets to this green space.

Dammerstock Estate Row Houses, Karlsruhe \(GER\) –  
Walter Gropius  
Parallel slabs in a strict north-south orientation built

housing units are only 5.60 m-wide row houses, with  
transverse central staircases as organizing elements.  
Residential High-rises  
1928  
Woodstock Tower, New York \(USA\) – H. Douglas Ives  
Part of the world’s first high-rise estate, Tudor City – a  
privately financed, speculative development aimed at  
offering office workers accommodation close to their place  
of employment – the building consists of over 400  
hotel-like 1-room apartments \(“Efficiencies”\) on its lower  
floors. More spacious apartments are located on the upper,  
terraced levels.  
Residential High-rises  
1929  
San Remo Tower, New York \(USA\) – Emery Roth  
The highest of Emery Roth’s luxury high-rises on Central Park  
is comprised of two towers on a U-shaped, slightly terraced  
base covering the width of a city block. The maisonettes in  
the towers – with representative rooms below and sleeping  
quarters for residents and servants above – offer their  
inhabitants views in every direction and the feeling of living  
in a freestanding villa high above the city.  
Residential High-rises  
1929  
1420 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago \(USA\) – Hooper & Janusch  
9- and 11-room single-floor apartments and 16-room  
maisonettes are equipped with high-quality finishes, open  
fireplaces, and the latest innovations such as refrigerators.  
The floor plans exhibit a typical layout for the time period\:  
large, representative rooms look out over Lake Michigan and  
are connected by a long corridor past the servants’ quarters  
to the bedrooms at the rear. A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
1929  
Housing for the Minimum Subsistence  
Level  
In 1929, an international group of archi-  
tects under the direction of Ernst May  
posed the question of how to design an  
apartment for the minimum subsistence  
level at the second Congrès International  
d’Architecture Moderne \(CIAM\). 105 designs  
in a consistent graphic presentation with  
comparative values like apartment size,  
volume, and window surface area were  
collected to form a systematic floor plan  
typology for affordable housing.

1930–34  
Les Gratte-Ciel de Villeurbane, Lyon \(FR\) – Môrice Leroux  
Two long slabs, repeatedly interrupted by perpendicular,  
terraced residential towers, were created as part of a larger  
master plan for a new urban district. Various apartment  
sizes – but predominantly 3-room units – are efficiently  
designed to reduce the rent for the working-class residents.  
The high density of the configuration is moderated by  
setback roof terraces, public plazas, and a number of shops  
on the ground floor.  
New Building Type\: Slab Housing –  
Walter Gropius  
Of the opinion that architecture should  
be practical and standardizable, Gropius  
established rules for a building type that  
was in part motivated by medical findings  
in the late 19th century concerning the  
effects of sunlight in preventing the spread  
of hazardous bacteria and the necessity of  
proper ventilation for healthy housing. The  
use of light studies resulted in precisely  
calculated distances between the parallel,  
open layout of the slab buildings oriented  
to the east and west. This configura-  
tion became an important instrument  
in modern urban planning. Although the  
scheme was implemented in row house  
developments as well, the dominant image  
of slab housing stems from multi-story,  
freestanding, linear buildings with shared  
access and circulation, be they vertical or  
horizontal.  
Slab Housing  
1930  
Narkomfin, Moscow \(USSR\) – Ginzburg & Milnus  
A new model of society was proclaimed with the Russian  
Revolution, in which the traditional role of the family was  
questioned in favor of the collective. To facilitate the  
employment of women, kindergartens and canteens were  
incorporated into the building, while the private kitchens in  
the compact, split-level and duplex units of the residential  
slab were minimized. All collective spaces are  
accommodated in a separate building.

A strict east-west oriented layout of slab buildings for  
employees of the Siemens production facilities. Double-loaded  
staircases provide access to the apartments. In Scharoun’s  
design \(upper left\), a living room spanning the width of the  
building – with a loggia, dining niche, and windows with flower  
boxes – serves as the central circulation space, from which a  
“slipper hall” leads to a group of bedrooms.  
1930  
21 1933–35  
Highpoint Terrace, London \(UK\) – Lubetkin and Tecton  
One the first Modernist residential buildings in England –  
where a ground floor raised on pilotis with a tea room and  
winter garden extends an invitation to linger – was  
commissioned by the industrialist Sigmund Gestetner for  
his office workers. The single-floor flats are accessed from a  
meandering circulation area. Due to the building’s  
double-cross shape, most of the orthogonally organized  
units are exposed to natural light on three sides.  
1935  
Casa Rustici, Milan \(IT\) – G. Terragni, P. Lingeri  
Modern architecture integrated into a historic block  
structure\: two slab-like building segments, which – opti-  
mally cross-ventilated and oriented east-west – frame a  
courtyard that opens up to the city, are linked by a layer of  
balconies along the street to complete the block infill type.  
A spacious hall serves as the circulation center; almost all  
important living areas look out over the urban avenue.  
Building Exhibitions and Model Estates/Row House  
1932  
Werkbundsiedlung Vienna Row House \(AT\) – Adolf  
Loos  
The “Raumplan” concept was adapted to this  
three-story row house\: a double-height living room is  
bordered by a gallery with a built-in sofa.  
1935  
Kollektivhus Stockholm \(SE\) – Sven Markelius  
A residential building conceived to unburden working  
mothers. There is a day-care facility for children, meals can  
be ordered from the central kitchen and delivered to most  
apartments by dumbwaiter, a laundry chute leads straight  
to the serviced laundry room. Storage for sporting  
equipment, a restaurant, a reading room, and the roof  
terrace are all shared. Alternatively, small yet efficiently  
laid-out kitchens in each unit offer residents the possibility  
to cook for themselves. All ancillary rooms and bedrooms  
branch off from the open living room.

This project is regarded as the first systematically  
designed and erected large-scale housing estate, which  
– following the urban design principles of CIAM – merged  
industrially planned manufacturing cycles with customized  
construction methods. The distance between the  
steel-frame building structures was determined by the  
dimensions of the reinforced concrete facade elements  
produced on-site. Lightweight facade components were  
produced in the workshops of Jean Prouvé.

Bergpolder Residential High-rise, Rotterdam \(NL\)  
– Van Tijen, Brinkman & Van der Vlugt  
An experimental residential high-rise realized as a  
steel-frame structure with wooden floors and a panel  
facade, oriented north-south to optimize the lighting  
situation of the living spaces. The efficient floor plan  
design aimed to minimize circulation areas; a sliding  
door enables flexible use of the rooms adjacent to  
the living room. The elevator stopped only at every  
second floor.

by the residents.  
22 A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
Housing in the Post-war Era  
After the Second World War, many cities  
experienced an acute housing crisis.  
Housing developments therefore increas-  
ingly drew on the already established  
urban design and architectural repertoire  
of the Modernists – often at larger scales  
than before due to the housing shortage  
and at times built to inferior standards.  
Reconstruction efforts primarily followed  
the tenets of the landscaped automo-  
tive city, for which even completely intact  
urban quarters were razed. Traffic arteries  
linking growing suburban developments to  
the city exacerbated the situation.  
Housing in the Post-war Era  
1943–49  
Stuyvesant Town, New York \(USA\) – Irwin Clavan, Gilmore  
Clarke  
Linked rows of austere, cross-shaped towers replaced 18  
impoverished city blocks. Initially conceived as mass  
housing for war veterans, this privately financed large-scale  
estate provided its residents with affordable housing in  
park-like surroundings in the middle of the city.  
Housing in the Post-war Era  
1945–1964  
Reconstruction of Le Havre’s City Center \(FR\) – Auguste  
Perret  
The layout of the historic city center was readapted for the  
reconstruction and rebuilt with a uniform, representative  
building ensemble realized using methods taken from  
industrial mass housing. In the 4-room apartments, the  
living room forms the organizational and spatial focal point\:  
work or dining areas can be flexibly connected along the  
street facade, bedrooms adjoin directly in the lateral axis.  
The – very innovative – mechanically ventilated bathrooms  
are accessed from three sides.  
Workers Settlements  
1936–54  
Sunila Workers Settlement, Kotka \(FI\) – Alvar Aalto  
In this ensemble constructed over multiple decades, rows of  
three-story units are arranged along the southern slopes,  
gardens, and transport arteries of a valley. The building  
organization takes advantage of the topographical situation\:  
1-room apartments on the lower level are accessed from the  
south side, the 2-room apartments above either directly  
from the ground floor or by stairs from the north. The idea  
to provide each apartment with its own entrance instead of  
sharing a single staircase was based on sociological factors\:  
privacy and identity of place despite high density was an  
important concern of the architect.  
Urbanization Processes in Latin America,  
North Africa, and Asia  
Concurrent with the developments in  
Europe and North America, many cities in  
North Africa, Latin America, and Asia were  
experiencing large population increases.  
This was partly due to the influx of political  
refugees, but above all else to large-scale  
economic migration to the urban centers.  
As the existing structures were not able to  
cope, large informal settlements arose, as  
did new housing policies and methods of  
dealing with the situation. Still under colo-  
nial rule, large-scale housing estates were  
initiated in North Africa as testing grounds  
for similarly large developments in France.  
Urbanization Processes in Latin America  
1945  
El Silencio Residential Estate, Caracas \(VE\) – Carlos Raúl  
Villanueva  
An urban renewal ensemble of housing blocks for residents  
with low incomes was erected to replace a rundown  
district. The apartments in Block 4 have three to four  
similarly sized linked rooms, which generate a nearly  
use-neutral floor plan open to interpretation.

1945–48  
New Gourna Village, Luxor \(EG\) – Hassan Fathy  
Built to prevent expanding informal structures from  
encroaching on a historic burial site, the design for this  
settlement takes its cue from traditional social  
communities comprised of 10 to 20 families, each with its  
own designated area. The housing units are arranged  
around small courtyards. Utility rooms occupy the ground  
floor, bedrooms connect to a loggia on the upper floor that  
doubles as an outdoor living room.

23 Housing in the Post-war Era  
1946-62  
Churchill Gardens, London \(UK\) – Powell and Moya  
In this publicly funded residential estate, which replaced an  
urban neighborhood badly damaged during the war, a wide  
spectrum of housing types were on offer. In the tall slab  
buildings, external staircases lead to single-story flats with  
open kitchens and open galleries to stacked maisonettes.  
1946  
New Towns Act \(UK\)  
This program initiated the development in  
Great Britain of 27 new, autonomous cities  
over the coming 50 years. It was conceived  
in reaction to the acute housing shortage  
after the war and also to avoid further  
urban sprawl in the larger metropolitan  
regions – particularly London. New Towns  
were initially a modern interpretation of  
the garden city, but in the end were often  
realized as automotive cities. As a model,  
they were adopted worldwide.  
24  
Suburbia  
Following the war, the erection of de-  
tached single-family home developments  
outside the city dramatically changed the  
face of domestic culture in the USA in only  
25 years. Construction programs such as  
the Housing Act of 1949, the expansion of  
expressways, and new serial production  
methods coalesced in a building boom,  
which first and foremost made it possible  
for the middle class to move out of the  
increasingly unpopular, large cities. Despite  
contributing greatly to the overdevelop-  
ment of rural landscapes, the suburbs  
became a symbol of American lifestyle in  
the post-war era – and were copied around  
the world.  
Suburbia  
1947–51  
Levittown, Long Island \(USA\) – Levitt & Sons  
This is the first of more than 200 developments named after the  
proprietor and project developer. Designed and built by the  
same company, they optimized planning and construction  
processes ensuring short construction times. The residents  
could pick from a selection of catalogue models. The entrance of  
the housing types with unfinished but upgradable attics often  
led directly into an open living area and kitchen. In the one-story  
types with upgradable attics, the sleeping quarters were located  
to one side, in the two-story types on the floor above.  
New Towns  
1947  
Harlow \(UK\) – Frederick Gibberd  
40 km outside London and built in a hilly, wooded, and  
sparsely populated landscape to alleviate the strain on  
industrial areas in the east of the metropolis, Harlow is  
divided into four districts, each conceived for 20,000  
residents and 3 km in radius, which in turn are composed of  
multiple neighborhoods grouped around their individual  
central areas.  
Housing in the Post-war Era/New Towns  
1949–54  
Tiburtino Residential Quarter, Rome \(IT\)  
A modern urban expansion combined with the  
heterogeneous nature of village-like structures and vernacu-  
lar architecture. Residential high-rises, terraced slabs, and  
row houses form a composition that follows the course of  
the streets. In the high-rises, the living room with loggia acts  
as a central circulation space, while in the lower slabs a  
corridor or hall divides the living and dining areas from the  
bedrooms. Offset and staggered building volumes, stepped  
access galleries, balconies, and rooftop gardens enliven the  
streetscape of this planned district. A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel

Unité d'Habitation, Marseille \(FR\) – Le Corbusier  
The Unité d‘Habitation was conceptualized as an  
autonomous slice of city for 1,600 residents – the number  
Le Corbusier deemed necessary to generate a functioning  
urban community – with shopping streets, shared rooftop  
spaces as well as the “Rues Intérieures” on every third floor,  
from which different apartment types are accessed from  
both sides. The distinctive, very narrow maisonettes run the  
entire width of the building above and below the access  
floors. \(see page 184\)  
Urbanization Processes in Latin America  
1950–52  
Pedregulho, Rio de Janeiro \(BR\) – Affonso Eduardo Reidy  
This estate in an open landscaped park is regarded as an  
important example of Brazilian post-war Modernist social  
housing. The most prominent building is the curvilinear slab  
resting on pilotis that snakes its way through the topography  
of the site. Its mid-section remains open to the elements, is  
accessed from the upper slope and provides space for public  
programs such as a kindergarten or playground. The lower  
levels mostly contain very compact flats. Despite their  
modest size, the two levels of maisonettes above are visually  
linked by a connecting void between the floors.

Stalinallee, Berlin \(GER\) – Hermann Henselmann \(master  
plan, high-rise\)  
As in other European capitals of the former Eastern Bloc,  
monumental, representative architecture as an expression  
of political power was adopted for public housing.  
“Residential palaces for workers” with roughly 3,000  
apartments in blocks and towers offered many comforts to  
their inhabitants – such as high ceilings, spacious floor  
plans, and technological innovations including two-way  
intercom systems, telephone lines, and garbage chutes –  
which social housing in the West was not in a position to  
provide. \(see page 229\)  
Urbanization Processes in North Africa

ATBAT Collective Housing, Casablanca \(MA\) – Woods,  
Bodiansky, Candilis  
As part of an estate for former slum inhabitants, three  
multi-story structures are based on the traditional courtyard  
houses of the region. The 2-room apartments in the slab  
building are arranged along patios that alternate every floor  
from one facade to the other. Completely walled-in but  
open to the sky, they form a climatic and social buffer by  
separating the interior rooms from the external access  
galleries and shielding them from direct sunlight. The  
apartments are cross-ventilated and the kitchen – a  
potential heat source – is located outside.  
Slab housing  
1952  
Flats for Air France, Brazzaville \(CG\) – P. B. Berruet  
Behind the adjustable brise-soleil, enclosed areas for the  
staircases, kitchens, and bathrooms alternate with living  
and sleeping areas open to both sides. By placing the  
circulation path along the facades, a buffer to the set-back  
living areas is formed, protecting them from direct sunlight  
and the tropical climate.  
Housing in the Post-war Era  
1954  
Torre Velasca, Milan \(IT\) – BBPR  
During the post-war reconstruction period, the  
multifunctional high-rise with commercial space on the  
ground floor, 18 office floors and eight residential levels at  
the very top strove to increase the density of the  
pre-existing city instead of replacing it. This position was  
pursuant to the contemporary debate in Italy, which  
endeavored to develop modern architecture in a contextual  
dialogue with the historic city instead of in opposition to it.  
A range of different apartment types was produced\: studios,  
flats with spacious, corner living rooms, as well as  
maisonettes.  
Urbanization Processes in North Africa  
1954  
Sidi Othman Apartments, Casablanca \(MA\) – André  
Studer  
The slabs and high-rises are inspired by North African  
housing types. The compact units are organized around  
large living rooms and cantilevered patios. Stacked in an  
offset manner and each supported by a single column,  
these patios lend the facade its distinctive character.  
1954  
25 1954  
New Building Type\: Low Rise High  
Density  
Criticism of urban sprawl due to the con-  
struction of detached single-family homes  
led to a search for alternative solutions.  
In contrast to other multifamily housing  
schemes, each unit was to be provided  
with private, outdoor spaces and a direct,  
preferably ground-level entrance from  
the public sphere, while interlocking or  
semi-detached constellations of similar,  
neighboring units simultaneously ensured  
a high ratio of land use. Besides more  
classical row house configurations, low-  
lying estates with cluster-like structures  
emerged that took advantage of back-to-  
back arrangements, patchwork-like pat-  
terns, or more complex, three-dimensional  
groupings. Lighting recesses in the building  
volume such as patios became distinctive  
design features.  
Mass Housing in Asia  
In Asian cities like Singapore and Hong  
Kong, or in countries like South Korea,  
“emergency” housing types were initially  
implemented to deal with issues such as  
uncontrollable growth and the resulting in-  
formal settlements. From such immediate  
challenges, residential property developers  
arose who have since dominated large seg-  
ments of housing construction. The supply  
of building land was partially monopolized  
and large-scale development given priority,  
as providing housing to the population  
became an important aspect of political  
and economic stabilization policies. Large  
housing estates were built not only in the  
form of New Towns, but also in part as  
replacements for older, more organically  
evolved, low-rise urban districts.

Halen Estate, Herrenschwanden \(CH\) – Atelier 5  
In this dense ensemble on sloping terrain with very deep,  
primarily 4 m-wide, multi-storied housing units, the upper  
rows have gardens on the roofs of the unit below. Each  
house enjoys an unobstructed view. \(see page 298\)  
Mass Housing in Asia  
1954  
Shek Kip Mei Estate, Hong Kong \(HK\) – Resettlement  
Department  
On Christmas day, 1953, a fire destroyed vast parts of an  
informal settlement in Shek Kip Mei inhabited by a large  
number of refugees from the Chinese Civil War. A relocation  
authority was initiated, marking the beginnings of a  
program of heavily subsidized housing construction under  
the later established Hong Kong Housing Authority. Initially,  
only emergency housing was built, but with improved  
political and economic stability, more permanent structures  
and increased standards for large portions of the urban  
population were introduced. The H-shaped block type  
realized in Shek Kip Mei in 1954 provided every family with  
only one room. Accessed by wraparound external galleries,  
they were arranged back-to-back, with the result that  
perforated dividing walls were necessary for cross-ventila-  
tion. Kitchens and bathrooms were shared.  
Housing in the Post-war Era  
1955–83  
Barbican Estate, London \(UK\) – Chamberlin, Powell, Bon,  
Arup  
By rebuilding a site that had been vacant since the end of  
the war, an attempt was made to reinvigorate inner-city  
housing. The large-scale project offered the possibility of  
creating a unique ensemble by combining cultural and  
educational institutions as well as a variety of building types  
around generous outdoor green spaces. With over 100  
different floor plans, a wide range of options were available,  
primarily geared toward upper middle-class residents. \(see

Mikrorayon residential districts \(USSR\)  
50 million apartments were built in the Soviet Union  
between 1955 and 1985. Using quantitative design charts,  
sun diagrams, and a multitude of standardized building  
elements, innumerable iterations of the so-called “Mikroray-  
ons” were realized – prefabricated residential districts with  
clearly defined community facilities. The Mikrorayon system  
had an impact on almost all member states of the former  
Eastern Bloc and was later also influential in housing  
construction in the People’s Republic of China.

23 de Enero housing development, Caracas \(VE\) – Villa-  
nueva  
This residential district with a total of 9,108 apartments was  
regarded as an exemplary development scheme for the  
entire country. Elevators lead to external access galleries on  
every fourth floor, which connect to double-loaded  
staircases to the apartments on the other floors. At the front  
of the units, a living room and kitchen form day areas, while  
private rooms are arranged in a row at the rear.

Brasília \(BR\) – Lucio Costa \(master plan\)  
Brazil’s new capital was built in only four years and adhered  
in every respect to the CIAM principles of a functionally  
segregated city. Each “Superquadra” contains roughly 600  
apartments in nine to 11 slab buildings resting on pilotis  
above the open cityscape. Taken together, four such blocks  
and shared community facilities form a neighborhood zone.

Interbau, Hansaviertel, Berlin \(GER\) – Otto Bartning  
\(overall design\), Kreuer Jobst \(master plan\), Otto Senn  
\(apartment building\)  
A model for the “city of tomorrow” – and a reaction in the  
West to the “Stalinallee” \(see also 1952–60\) – the ensemble  
of high-rises, slab and low-rise buildings was arranged in  
the middle of a landscaped urban park on a site where the  
urban block structure had been heavily damaged in the war.  
Renowned architects of the time like Le Corbusier, Aalto, van  
den Broek and Bakema, Gropius, Niemeyer or Senn designed  
and realized exemplary ideas on modern housing. In Senn’s  
apartment building, three individual apartment types fan  
out around a central and natural lit circulation area. Each  
apartment has views in two directions.  
Urbanization Processes in North Africa  
1957  
Climat de France, Algiers \(DZ\) – Fernand Pouillon  
An elongated superblock with an inner courtyard  
surrounded by a high colonnade forms the center of the  
social housing district, composed of diverse building types  
derived partly from regional housing typologies. Above the  
abundant shops on the ground floor, 360 deep apartments  
stretch between the street facade perforated with small  
windows and the interior colonnade, which provides  
protection from direct sunlight.  
New Building Type\: Large-scale Estates  
with Space-enclosing Structures  
Space-enclosing structures in taller and more  
meandering forms were implemented in  
the 1960s and 1970s to ensure the creation  
of protected inner spaces despite the high  
density of such projects on an urban scale –  
in contrast to the much-criticized open slab  
developments. Cityscapes accentuated by  
sporadic towers emerged, where spacious  
open areas free of traffic noise surrounded  
the buildings – large-scale sculptures for the  
society of the future. Many of these develop-  
ments implemented cluster architecture  
consisting of similar floor plan segments  
arranged in rows, stacked, or turned to  
optimize natural lighting or views. As time  
passed, these large-scale developments were  
criticized as mono-functional and inhospi-  
table bedroom communities, their build-  
ings characterized as “residential silos” and  
“concrete fortresses.”  
New Towns  
1957  
Gleadless Valley, Sheffield \(UK\) – J. L. Womersley  
This development was built on three sides of a wooded  
valley outside the city at the same time as Park Hill. Varied  
building designs with approximately 4,500 apartments in  
total are divided into three “neighborhoods” connected by  
walkways, each with its own shops and schools. Row houses  
are in part accessed from a protruding terrace on their  
upper level, three-story units connected to form  
cross-shaped buildings.

High-rises  
1957–66  
Edifício Copan, São Paulo \(BR\) – Oscar Niemeyer  
One of the tallest residential buildings of its time, this  
sinuous high-rise slab in the center of São Paulo was  
created with a diverse residential population in mind. The  
apartment types span from studio apartments occupying a  
single bay with sanitary rooms and kitchens in the darker,  
rear zone to 350 m² apartments with separate servants’  
quarters. The separate elevator core is connected with  
ramps and staircases to the main volume. Central corridors  
and access galleries behind the deep lamellae of the facade  
lead to the apartments entrances. In addition, a number of  
apartments are directly accessed from private elevators.  
Large-scale Estates with Space-enclosing Structures  
1957–61  
Park Hill, Sheffield \(UK\) – J. L. Womersley  
On a hill with a view over the city, the large-scale structure  
replaced an impoverished working-class district. The bent  
slabs follow the topography of the site. In the south,  
four-story building segments engage the surrounding lower  
buildings, while in the north, the building stands 13 stories  
tall. “Streets in the Air” on every third floor lead to  
apartment groups laid out across three bays and consisting  
of two studio apartments below and two maisonette units  
with open living areas above.  
Mass Housing in Asia  
1958  
Harumi Apartments, Tokyo \(JP\) – Kunio Maekawa  
Built by the Japanese Housing Association, this building  
remained exceptional in scale in Japan due to the  
traditionally small parcel structure. The high-rise slab  
combines a building structure inspired by Le Corbusier with  
traditional Japanese interior components, thus enabling a  
high degree of flexibility within the extremely compact  
apartments. \(see page 187\)

1958  
Extension of the “Ring” Estate, Berlin-Siemensstadt  
\(GER\) – Hans Scharoun  
So-called “residential homesteads” with community  
functions were formulated in conjunction with freely  
shaped slab buildings – as an extension and alternative to  
the more rigid structures from the 1930s. The “Symbiosis”  
apartment type combined a 4½ and a 1-room apartment  
with individual entrances, which could be combined or  
separated from one another. \(see also 1930, Siemensstadt\)  
Slab Housing  
1959  
Slab type SQS 308, Brasilia \(BR\) – Marcelo Campello and  
Sérgio Rocha  
Double-loaded staircases lead to apartments with separate  
service and servants’ quarters along one of the long facades.  
The dining area adjacent to the kitchen is the center. The  
living room is offset to one side, and the bedroom wing with  
its own corridor on the other. Brise-soleil or loggias shield  
the units from the heat of the sun. \(see also 1956, Brasília\)  
1958  
Mass Housing in Asia  
1958  
Hongshunli Commune, Tianjin \(CN\)  
Due to an extreme housing shortage, individual living space  
in the young People’s Republic of China was very limited,  
which – on top of dogma proclaiming the virtues of the  
commune over those of the individual – led to a search for  
compact housing arrangements. For this reason, all  
activities that could be organized collectively were practiced  
in the common areas. Residential units consequently  
consisted only of two bedrooms, the bathrooms were  
shared, communal canteens replaced individual kitchens,  
sewing rooms and nurseries were offered as additional  
amenities.  
Mass Housing in Asia  
Since 1960  
Building and Apartment Types, Singapore \(SG\) – Housing  
Development Board  
Between 1960 and 1965, the HDB built about 120,000 largely  
standardized apartment units in equally standardized  
housing blocks. Over the years, apartment standards, sizes,  
and variety increased and by 2000 more than 85 % of the  
population lived in HDB apartments. Subsidized home  
ownership and social mixing prevented the rise of many  
problems experienced in Western large-scale developments.

Low Rise High Density  
1962–1995  
Puchenau Estate, Linz \(AT\) – Roland Rainer  
The result of over three decades of building and research  
into three topics\: minimum parcel sizes, economic  
access systems, and passive solar thermal energy. From  
the four-story buildings with vertical access cores along  
the street to the one-story houses on the river, a formally  
and socially mixed estate design with a total of 984  
housing units emerges that follows the cadence of the  
landscape.  
Alternative Concepts  
During the 1960s, when the immediate  
housing crises of the post-war years had  
been alleviated and economies rebuilt,  
other aspects came to the foreground in  
Western societies. These were primar-  
ily incited by younger generations, who  
questioned the current practices and  
paradigms of society at large, but also  
within the architectural discourse of the  
time. The members of Team 10 countered  
the dogma of urban functional segregation  
with an alternative model that emerged  
from Candilis and Woods’ well-known eth-  
nographic studies of organically developed  
contexts in Casablanca, and which empha-  
sized the relationship between housing  
unit, building, street, district, and city.  
Projects like Archigram’s “Walking Cities,”  
Constant Nieuwenhuys’ “New Babylon”  
or Cedric Price’s “Fun Palace” developed  
visionary concepts that anticipated social  
mobility and cultural change.  
Low Rise High Density  
1963  
The Ryde, London \(UK\) – Phippen, Randall, Parkes  
A diverse patio housing estate with high living  
quality despite minimal unit widths and a simple  
construction method. 28 staggered, one-story  
houses are structured by shear walls protruding into  
the exterior space, which divide the houses and  
their tightly interlocking outdoor spaces from one  
another. With the exception of the kitchen and  
bathroom, almost all interior rooms are enclosed  
with sliding walls and subsequently use-neutral.  
\(see page 350\)  
Alternative Concepts  
1962  
Open Building \(NL\) – N. John Habraken, SAR  
Postulated as an “Alternative to Mass Housing,” the concept  
proposed dividing the built environment into two distinct  
categories\: a support system as the only part for which an  
architect would still be needed and an infill system placed  
in the hands of the residents so that housing could be  
adapted to individual needs. This approach was concerned  
with both the residential environment \(SAR 73\) as well as  
with the buildings themselves \(SAR 65\). A diagram from 1967  
illustrates the principle of the twin structures\: the support  
system is shown as parallel bands with predefined zones for  
the variable infill system comprised of common, service and  
circulation areas. A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
Large-scale Estates with Space-enclosing Structures  
1963–1974  
Märkisches Viertel, Berlin \(GER\) – W. Düttmann,  
H. C. Müller, G. Heinrichs  
Space-enclosing, staggered, and linked buildings form large  
semi-courtyards; pre-existing detached single-family homes  
were left intact and complemented. This residential  
complex demonstrated a new trend toward increased  
vertical density in housing estates. \(see also 1969,  
Wilhelmsruher Damm and page 272\)  
New Building Type\: Terraced Buildings  
New ideas concerning terraced buildings as  
artificial landscapes emerged concurrent  
with the visions of Kenzo Tange, Walter  
Jonas, and Yona Friedman, who proposed  
city figures that hover above the ground  
and branch out horizontally and vertically.  
This new building type provided a chance  
to outfit every apartment with an open,  
outdoor space, while still generating a high  
level of built density. In cases where the  
terraced building did not follow an existing  
slope, the deep building interior on the  
lower floors was used for ancillary func-  
tions. Similar to other building types of the  
time, floor plan clusters were often imple-  
mented so that the overall expression was  
not defined by clear geometric volumes,  
but by a spatial structure that could seem-  
ingly continue on indefinitely.  
Large-scale Estates with Space-enclosing Structures  
1966  
Cité des Courtillières, Pantin \(FR\) – Émile Aillaud  
As an alternative to the typical formal rigidity of large-scale  
complexes to date, a six-story ribbon-like slab building  
surrounded by star-shaped high-rises encloses an inner,  
landscaped park. The simple and economic floor plan with  
two groups of rooms meant it was possible to later combine  
them into larger apartments.  
Terraced Buildings  
1963  
Dubiner Apartments, Tel Aviv \(IL\) – Neumann, Hecker,  
Sharon  
The intimacy of small-scale, vernacular forms of housing is  
combined with the efficiency of a terraced building on a sloping  
site. Stacked, hexagonal modules form the basic structure. A  
long corridor running along the terraces connects the bedrooms  
to the deep, polygonal living room and kitchen.  
New Towns  
1967–1970  
Thamesmead New Town, London \(UK\) – Robert Rigg \(GLC\)  
An ensemble of differentiated building types proposed as  
an alternative to the monotony of the early New Towns\:  
residential high-rises increase the overall density, higher  
slabs along the river shelter lower-lying row houses with  
stacked maisonettes and community buildings. Most  
buildings are connected through a complex system of  
pathways raised one story above the ground – a typical  
model in which pedestrians are separated from automobile  
traffic, but also a protection measure against flooding. In  
the maisonettes, the kitchen, hall, and staircases form a  
buffer to the public space.  
Terraced Buildings  
1967  
Habitat, Montreal \(CA\) – Moshe Safdie  
The housing units of this experimental project created for the  
EXPO 67 consisted of 55 m² modules in a total of 16 different  
constellations. The basic module contains the entrance, living  
room, and kitchen; additional modules are attached vertically  
or horizontally. The interlocking configurations form a  
complex terrace-like structure with intriguing outdoor spaces  
and pathways. \(see page 258\)

Marquess Road, London \(UK\) – Darbourne and Darke  
As if along streets, apartments are strung along outdoor  
pathways on different levels; the rows are continually  
interrupted to create smaller groups of neighboring units.  
The apartments are primarily organized vertically\: two- to  
three-story back-to-back maisonettes are accessed through  
private front yards. In section, their upper levels cross over  
to the other side to benefit from views in multiple  
directions. \(see page 274\) Alternative Concepts/Low Rise High Density

Proyecto Experimental de Vivienda \(PREVI\), Lima \(PE\)  
– Peter Land \(master plan\), Charles Correa/Candilis,  
Josic, Woods \(housing type designs\)  
Architects from around the world conceived the layout and  
model houses for originally 1,500 low-rise units as an  
alternative to informal developments on the urban  
periphery. Their aim was the development of basic,  
prefabricated units for cost-effective “growing houses” –  
simple yet intelligent spatial structures that could be  
expanded by their inhabitants. In the design by Charles  
Correa, units with alternating narrow and wide modules  
interlock. The wide modules can accommodate larger  
rooms or be divided in two separate spaces, and the narrow  
modules ancillary functions like sanitary rooms. Staircases  
can be incorporated into the “side pockets.” In the design by  
Candilis, Josic and Woods parallel rows of linked room  
sequences – with larger rooms or patios in the wide rows,  
smaller bedrooms or service spaces in the narrow rows –  
border each in such a way that different floor plan layouts  
are possible.

An estate as a spatial system for low-income residents.  
Prefabricated container-like elements are arranged like a

Service tracts \(with entrance hall, kitchen, and WC\) and  
bedroom tracts \(with individual rooms, bathrooms, and a  
separate corridor\) surround the predominantly L-shaped living  
rooms of the apartments. These floor plan clusters shape the  
external appearance of the buildings\: connected groups of  
space-enclosing tower chains formed from stacked housing  
units. \(see also 1963–74, Märkisches Viertel and page 273\)  
Alternative Concepts  
1969–82  
Byker Regeneration, Newcastle upon Tyne \(UK\) – Ralph  
Erskine  
Instead of creating a master plan, a “plan of intent” formed  
the starting point for a mold-breaking participatory design  
process for both the public spaces and the apartment  
layouts. While 80 % of the housing units consist of low-rise  
row house types, the prominent Byker Wall wrapping around  
the northern edge of the estate was built to form a noise  
barrier to a planned thoroughfare. Very compact flats and  
maisonette apartments are accessed either from the ground  
floor or from external access galleries that double as social  
interfaces.  
Alternative Concepts  
1969–92  
Daikanyama Hillside Terrace, Tokyo \(JP\) – Fumihiko Maki  
This project was realized over multiple decades and makes  
use of Maki’s concept of the “Group Form” as a strategy for  
urban change\: a steadily, adaptively growing group of  
buildings along an eclectic series of public and semi-public  
spaces forge subtle transitions between the apartments and  
the city, between the private and the public. While the  
apartment floor plans of the first phase were simple and  
Modernist in nature, later types became more complex,  
adapting traditional Japanese principles for multilayered  
facades, making use of balconies and corridors as buffer  
zones, oriented toward calm courtyards.  
Alternative Concepts/Low Rise High Density  
1971–73  
Kasbah, Hengelo \(NL\) – Piet Blom  
Under a raised patchwork-like cluster of houses, the  
concept called for the creation of an open urban space  
below, which residents could use for commercial and social  
initiatives, even at times adapting the space to their needs.  
Each apartment type consists of the same two-story basic  
unit to which additional modules can be connected\: roof  
gardens, additional rooms above the paths and streets  
below or an entirely new unit. \(see page 302\) A Chronicle of Developments in Housing | Oliver Heckmann, Eric Zapel  
Asian New Towns  
While fewer and fewer large-scale estates  
were realized in Western societies, mass  
housing in the growing industrial countries  
of Asia remains the dominant housing  
form to this day – often with high-rises as  
a high density building type. In contrast  
to the West, these configurations are not  
primarily intended for low-income renters,  
but instead were built for the growing mid-  
dle class – predominantly with a model of  
home ownership in mind to help finance  
retirement. Cluster floor plans increasingly  
define the building shapes.  
Asian New Towns/Residential High-rises  
1971–81  
Sui Wo Court, Hong Kong \(HK\) – Palmer & Turner  
Subsidized home ownership in an ensemble consisting of  
nine high-rises in Sha Tin, one of the New Towns inspired by  
British models and built in the New Territories. The  
cross-shaped cluster floor plan is laid out around stacked  
three-story halls accessed by elevator on their lower level,  
which connects every 36 apartments into a neighborhood.  
The units are for the most part accessed from secondary  
staircases and open into the living room, from which a  
separate corridor leads to the individual rooms.  
Asian New Towns/Residential High-rises  
1970  
Seoseoul Apartments, Ahyeon-Dong/Sibeom  
Apartments, Yeouido \(SK\)  
Since the 1970s, residential high-rise estates have become  
the dominant form of housing in South Korea – realized by  
private developers instead of public entities and often  
replacing older, more organically evolved neighborhoods.  
By 2000, the number of residents in such developments  
rose to 50 % of the entire population. Thus, South Korea  
became the “Republic of Apartments.” In most of the  
similarly laid-out apartments, the living room takes up the  
motive of the central courtyard in traditional Korean Hanok  
housing types.  
1972  
Pruitt-Igoe, St. Louis \(USA\), beginning of  
demolition work  
For the architectural theorist Charles  
Jencks, the demolition of the failed large-  
scale housing development Pruitt-Igoe  
\(built 1951–56 – Minoru Yamasaki\) signified  
the “death of modern architecture.” But  
like many other such estates, its demise  
was not only the consequence of the  
anonymity of the architecture with its poor  
quality standards and lack of attention  
paid to communal issues. Originally de-  
signed for the middle class, its realization  
coincided with the exodus of better-off  
families to the newly built suburbs. These  
estates very quickly turned into ghettos,  
which in some cases eventually led to huge  
social problems accompanied by high  
vacancy rates.  
Residential High-rises  
1972  
Nagakin Capsule Tower, Tokyo \(JP\) – Kisho Kurokawa  
Industrially prefabricated capsules were meant to be easily  
installable on the load-bearing cores, to be exchanged at  
any point or to be flexibly linked to one another. The  
compact units are only the size of four tatami mats, have  
integrated built-in furniture and bathing cells and were  
conceptualized as work-live cells.  
Residential High-rises  
1974  
Lauderdale Tower, Barbican Estate, London \(UK\) –  
Chamberlin, Powell, Bon  
The three single-orientation, elongated 5-room apartments  
with corner living rooms opening up to loggias and escape  
balconies are functionally clearly structured and generate a  
cluster-like, triangular high-rise. \(see also 1955–83,  
Barbican\)  
1973  
Gallaratese II, Milan \(IT\) – Aldo Rossi  
Up to this point, Rossi was only known as a theorist who  
spurred on important debates about the architectural  
relevance of the historic city. The elongated slab structures  
were part of a collaborative design for a new housing  
development. Clearly structured, two-tier apartment plans  
reveal a kitchen and bathroom placed along an external  
access gallery and a connecting hallway leading to all other  
spaces of the two-room apartments.

1974  
Walden 7, Barcelona \(ES\) – Ricardo Bofill, Taller de  
Arquitectura  
Tower segments laid out in a checkerboard grid and  
connected around courtyards to form a complex high-rise  
cluster. A network of circulation paths on every second floor  
unites the individual apartments composed of 30 m²  
modules into a community. Instead of walls and hallways,  
only built-in furniture and varying floor levels zone the  
flowing spaces of the units. \(see page 240\)

Alt-Erlaa Residential Park, Vienna \(AT\) – Harry Glück  
Described as a “vertical garden city,” this large-scale housing  
scheme with terraced high-rises, onto which the green  
surroundings seemingly continue to grow, are remarkably  
well-liked despite the interior corridors having no windows  
and the apartments being oriented to one side only. The  
numerous community spaces in the belly of the building  
nurture neighborly contact, while spacious terraces provide  
a replacement for one’s own garden.

1976  
Pearl Bank Apartments, Singapore \(SG\) – Tan Cheng  
Siong, Archurban  
At 38 stories, the tallest residential high-rise in the city-state  
at the time and a response to a prolonged period of growth.  
The circulation system is located on the inner facade of the  
open cylinder and composed of external access galleries  
and branching secondary staircases. The varied apartment  
types are organized as split-levels, with open, dual-oriented  
living areas spanning between the inner circle and the  
exterior facade.  
Postmodernism/Back to the City  
With the increasing influence of  
Postmodernism and, particularly in Europe,  
the rediscovery of the city as an attrac-  
tive place to live, small-scale and diverse  
solutions began to appear as did projects  
searching for urban and architectural  
historic continuities. Partially influenced  
by discussions around the European  
Architectural Heritage Year 1975 as well  
as growing criticism of post-war planning  
and the resulting deserted city centers,  
the long neglected historic districts were  
gaining more appreciation. Block infill  
projects and the modernization of existing  
buildings were becoming an option and  
apartment floor plans less schematic, as  
they had to take local circumstances into  
consideration.  
Back to the City  
1976  
Calle Doña Maria Coronel, Seville \(ES\) – Cruz, Ortiz  
A kidney-shaped courtyard becomes a sculptural void  
on this irregular building site in the historic city center.  
Each apartment adapts very differently to the complex  
geometry, turning toward additional patios through  
crooked corridors, leading hallways around the  
courtyard or making use of the living room as an  
entrance and distribution center. The roof terraces and  
the courtyard are shared spaces. \(see page 104\)

Galgebakken, Copenhagen \(DK\) – Storgård,  
Orum-Nielsen, Marcussen  
A car-free estate providing a common site for diverse  
housing needs. Small groups of atrium houses, row houses  
and split-level housing types are bundled together with  
entrances, eat-in kitchens and at times play areas  
overlooking shared pathways or courtyards. For the most  
part, dually oriented living rooms open up to a garden at the  
rear. \(see page 306\)  
Second Demographic Shift\:  
Diversification  
Around the beginning of the 1970s, the so-  
called “second demographic shift,” which  
covers both increasingly diverse familial  
relations – later and lower birth rates,  
higher divorce rates, and an increasing  
number of unmarried couples – as well as  
changing social values – like the increasing  
relevance of self-actualization and equal  
gender roles – also had an impact on  
housing concepts. Besides the classic nu-  
clear family, diverse forms of cohabitation  
were developing, which were also often no  
longer conceived of as long-term solutions.  
Individual demands were formulated,  
which could no longer be satisfied by the  
dominant standard solutions of the time.  
Participation and self-building options  
changed approaches to design floor plan  
types were becoming more diverse and  
flexible.

rooms open was left up to the discretion of the  
residents. \(see page 352\)

Molenvliet, Papendrecht \(NL\) – Van der Werf, Werkgroep  
KOKON  
This project tested the “Open Building” principle of support  
and infill systems as well as participatory design methods  
for both the residential environment and building  
structures. Grouped around four car-free courtyards – thus  
enabling the creation of small, intimate neighborhoods  
– the overall structure, on a 4.80 m grid which remained  
open in two directions, was first parceled according to  
individual space requirements and then built out in close  
consultation with the wishes of the residents. Its capability  
to be freely subdivided made it possible to create a variety  
of housing types from studio apartments to 6-room  
arrangements and the accommodation of both housing and  
commercial units. \(see also 1962, Open Building\)

International Building Exhibition Berlin \(GER\)  
Two conceptual topics stand for a new, exemplary approach  
to urban redevelopment. In contrast to the previous  
dominance of the automotive city and large-scale  
demolitions, which sacrificed many older, organically  
evolved urban structures, “critical reconstruction” sought to  
reconstruct and increase density in inner-city areas with the  
historic city layout as its basis. Cautious urban renewal – an  
approach which grew out of the protest milieu of the  
squatting movement – pursued the preservation and  
rehabilitation of older housing stock. It also intended to  
stabilize and further develop existing social and functional  
structures within the urban districts – using the instruments  
of participation, self-help and modernization measures  
carried out by the inhabitants themselves.

Rauchstraße, Berlin \(GER\) – Rob Krier \(master plan\), Hans  
Hollein \(urban villa\)  
One of the most widely discussed urban compositions of the  
IBA was the solitary building ensemble on Rauchstraße, which  
transferred the suburban building type of the “Urban Villa” to  
the city center and adapted it for use as social housing. 10  
solitary buildings with a footprint of 21 x 21 m each were  
designed by different architects, and together with the end  
building by Rob Krier, surround a large garden courtyard. In the  
diagonally laid- out apartments, an octagon-shaped hall,  
which connects to almost every other room, leads directly  
from the entrance into the corner living room.

Odham’s Walk, London \(UK\) – Donald Ball  
Residents’ protests in Covent Garden led to the design of a  
lively residential quarter instead of a planned wholesale  
redevelopment. While ateliers, workshops, and exhibition  
spaces on the ground floor anchor the complex to the  
surrounding streets, 2- to 6-room apartments above  
encircle multiple interlocking courtyards. The maisonette  
apartments at the top are accessed from an external gallery  
that winds its way around the courtyards.  
Residential High-rises

Kanchanjunga Apartments, Mumbai \(IN\) – Charles Correa  
A high-rise for wealthy residents is optimally laid out for the  
climate\: both the building and the open, split-level floor  
plans are oriented to maximize cross ventilation from the  
dominant wind patterns. An outdoor layer of loggias – in the  
form of deeply drawn-in, double-height verandas at the  
corners of the building – help shield against direct sunlight  
and monsoon rains. \(see page 242\)

33 Urban Revitalization  
Extensive, centrally located areas whose  
original purpose as industrial or transporta-  
tion sites has become obsolete as a result  
of structural changes and technological  
innovation, were used for urban revitaliza-  
tion strategies. Projects such as IJplein,  
KNSM- & Java-eiland or Borneo Sporenburg in  
Amsterdam, HafenCity in Hamburg, Nyhavn in  
Copenhagen, Docklands in Melbourne or the  
port area of Toronto offered a unique oppor-  
tunity to set a large-scale accent – not only  
for the reanimation of areas near the inner  
city, but also for new urban housing models.  
Back to the City

Rue de Meaux, Paris \(FR\) – Renzo Piano  
The complex extends across an entire block and is  
simultaneously infl uenced by both the surrounding block  
edge and courtyard building types to form a consistent  
urban ensemble. The fl oor plans are clearly structured\: a  
dually oriented, divisible living room is located in the  
mid-section of the single-story fl ats, with the kitchen and  
access area on the one side, bedrooms with a secondary  
corridor and bathrooms on the other.

The original high-rise ensemble planned for a new  
urban district in a former shipyard directly across from  
the city center was changed to rows of parallel blocks  
due to protests. The fl oor plans are dominated by stairs  
– transversely connecting single-story fl ats at different  
junctures, and lengthwise within the maisonettes.

Wide wraparound galleries on every second fl oor provide  
access to the maisonettes and single-story apartments  
on the north side and function as balconies to the south.  
By setting the shear walls at 5 m intervals, the individual  
units can be reconfi gured without any structural  
constraints, making it possible to create very diverse  
apartment types. In order to increase the amount of living  
space for each unit, standards were dramatically reduced,  
industrial building components used and walls left  
unfi nished. \(see page 194\)  
Low Rise High Density  
1988–93  
CIDCO Housing, Navi Mumbai \(IN\) – Raj Rewal  
Part of a larger urban development scheme, the project is  
considered a model for affordable housing in a low-rise,  
pedestrian-friendly and dense building structure. A range of  
housing units brings together not only different sized  
families but also diverse income groups. Cubic volumes in a  
cluster-like composition form ensembles up to three stories  
in height around common courtyards with roof terraces at  
various levels.  
Housing at the End of the 20th Century  
Housing at the end of the 20th century is  
exceptionally heterogeneous. Neoliberal  
patterns of thought influenced hous-  
ing policies and in the 1990s led to the  
withdrawal of public funding from social  
housing in a number of Western societies.  
With this development, many restrictive  
measures were loosened and alterna-  
tive approaches filled the resulting gaps.  
However, this also led to an increasing  
shortage of affordable housing. With the  
demise of Postmodernism – which was  
increasingly criticized as self-referential  
and purely formal – architects again  
increasingly turned towards more concrete  
problems and developments. They began  
to design more conceptually, and eco-  
nomic and social aspects were considered  
anew. Simultaneously, residential buildings  
outside of Europe and North America  
increasingly influenced the debate.

more daylight. In this manner, spatially complex  
mini-apartments are generated in the interior. \(see page 118\)

# Challenges and Tendencies  
In contrast to a review of the past – where the distance  
of time allows for a more accurate reflection on which  
historical, societal, and economic developments or design  
strategies challenged existing paradigms and contributed  
significantly to the development of housing – the present  
can only be described in tendencies. What is discussed here  
are some of the most important challenges facing urban  
housing today. Concrete examples are offered as illustrations  
of potential design solutions.  
The Social Segregation of Cities  
An increasing section of the population is threatened with  
exclusion from the real-estate market – whether as renters or  
buyers – because they simply cannot afford the rapidly acceler-  
ating cost of housing. This is not only due to the global financial  
crisis of 2007, but also to the increasing attractiveness of real  
estate as an investment, the often-cited gap in income develop-  
ment, and even factors like online vacation rental platforms that  
increasingly deprive cities attractive to tourists of sufficient  
residential space. The current scarcity of affordable housing  
is also further aggravated in Western industrial societies  
by the steady growth in the attractiveness of city life – with  
simultaneous high and still increasing numbers of empty  
properties in many rural regions. The situation is made more  
acute by processes of gentrification, where in well-located but

Dattner Architects, Grimshaw Architects\: Bronx Social Housing, New York, 2012  
The project, which was built as a model for “affordable, sustainable and  
reproducible” housing in a central location, combines three building types taken  
from the surroundings – a row of townhouses, a higher block with duplex units  
and a high-rise – to form a continuous building, the roof of which winds its way  
up from the courtyard to the uppermost roof terrace and can be used as a  
collective fruit and vegetable garden as well as for recreational activities. Small  
shops, a health center, work-life units and a fitness center enliven the juncture  
between the street and the courtyard.  
36  
often neglected neighborhoods, socially and ethnically diverse  
residents are pushed out by groups with higher incomes.  
This development requires counter measures, that with  
more inclusive concepts attempt to stem the trend toward  
social segregation within cities – which on a societal level  
can also be viewed critically – by creating new models for af-  
fordable housing, whether in the form of new building types,  
new property development models, through the renewal and  
expansion of social housing programs, cautious forms of in-  
creasing inner-city density as well as renewed, contemporary  
research into “housing for the minimum subsistence level.”  
The inhabitants to be considered are extremely heterogene-  
ous and span from singles, couples, families, retirees, and  
immigrants to groups on the edge of society such as the  
homeless 1, 2, 3.

Michael Maltzan Architects\: Star Apartments, Los Angeles, 2014  
In this residential project for homeless people, the goal to foster a  
social interface with the immediate surroundings through a mix of  
uses was applied to the redevelopment of an existing parking  
structure. The ground floor is occupied by a health center for  
residents and neighbors, and the level above acts as a podium with  
communal gardens, jogging path and meeting places. The  
prefabricated residential units stacked above each have their own  
bathroom and kitchen and are connected in an open spatial fabric.  
Open voids offering views of both the city beyond and the podium  
below, and numerous staircases and external galleries are meant  
to foster contact. Challenges and Tendencies | Oliver Heckmann

HAHOH Haas Heckmann Architekten\: Am Ottersgraben House, Zell am  
Harmersbach, 2007  
A house with initially four compact apartments was to be built in such a way to  
keep open the option of completely different layouts. The scenarios included  
apartments for singles or couples, units for families as well as a multi-genera-  
tional house comprising all fl oors. The two staircases on the ground fl oor serve as  
intersection for various connections\: all adjacent areas – the units above and  
below, to the left and right as well as the stair landings – can be linked in a  
fl exible manner.  
Archplan AG\: Wohnfabrik Solinsieme, St. Gallen, 2002  
Solinsieme – a combination of the words “solo” \(alone\) and “insieme” \(together\)  
– is a participatory project initiated by the residents, all in the second half of their  
lives, and combines individual housing with a more community-based lifestyle.  
An existing factory was converted and expanded with a new building, which acts  
as a collective intersection comprising access areas and sun decks. In total, the  
shared spaces make up almost 20 % of the building surface and also include  
studios, guest rooms, a roof terrace, a bike store and a community room with  
enough space for events.  
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE\: GENERATIONS  
While the increasing quantitative imbalance between gen-  
erations is above all a social and economic problem, specifi c  
alternative housing strategies are also required for the differ-  
ent generations – with foresight into the different residential  
forms and locations inhabitants prefer during each phase of  
life or the fact that future generations may simply be much  
smaller in number.  
among many others. Familial relations and constellations  
are changing much quicker and more often than in previous  
times, thus increasing the demands on the fl exibility of both  
the individual apartment fl oor plan, as well as the way in  
which adjacent units can be connected to or separated from  
one another 4.  
earlier generations – for instance, a preference for collective  
or assisted living 5, 6.  
Families  
In particular the family – with the nuclear family as the  
main object of housing standardization research for a long  
time – has become more diversifi ed over the years. Besides  
the traditional model, there exist single-parent households,  
patchwork families, and multi-generational living situations,  
Baby Boomers  
As the baby boomer generation ages, the number of retirees  
is going to dramatically increase in the coming years. A grow-  
ing elderly population in many societies will have to be coun-  
tered with a considerable expansion of appropriate fl oor  
plan typologies and forms of living that are not only suitable  
for this demographic development, but also take into ac-  
count that seniors today increasingly prefer to live in urban  
areas or have other, more diverse wishes and demands than  
Millennials  
Among so-called millennials, who today range from 18 to 30  
years old, a number of signifi cant changes have also taken  
place\: increasingly infl uential to where and how one lives  
are not only longer periods of education, a desire to fi rst  
establish a career or the fact that marriage is more seldom,  
occurs later or not at all, while divorce rates increase, but  
also that in comparison to older generations they often earn  
considerably less and have fewer assets. While the more af-  
fl uent segment often lives alone in 2- to-3-room apartments,  
refl ective of the more general trend toward more living space  
per person, many millennials are increasingly excluded from  
the real-estate market. Breaking free of conventions and

Winnipeg, 2010  
In this project realized for underprivileged families, multi-story  
residential units – each with its own entrance – surround a  
communal courtyard and space for everyday interaction. The  
units are comprised of very compact, narrow room modules  
connected to form vertical and horizontal spatial sequences,  
which generate apartment types for the various needs of the  
diverse inhabitants. The organization of both the building and  
the individual units aims to reduce ineffi cient and unattractive  
access spaces in order to reduce rental costs as much as  
possible.

Raspeig, Alicante, 2005  
Set in a new public parc, the project couples autonomous living for seniors with  
services and care above a day-care facility. The inserted bathrooms on both sides  
of the dividing walls cleverly zone the fl oor plans of the individual units\: on one  
side they subtly narrow the open transition from the living room to the bedroom,  
and on the other they are inserted fl ush with the built-in furniture of the kitchen  
and storage spaces.

Naruse Inokuma Architects\: LT Josai, Nagoya, 2013  
LT Josai reacts to a growing social trend in Japan in  
which singles decide to share a living space temporarily  
or more permanently without knowing one another  
beforehand. Their private rooms surround an open,  
split-level common space spanning all floors. Even the  
bathrooms are shared.

SsD Architecture\: Songpa Micro Housing, Seoul, 2014  
The spatial limitations of the micro apartments here are  
compensated for by semi-private open interstitial  
spaces that form shared thresholds through which  
multiple units can be combined. This matrix is  
complemented by “shared living rooms” that can be  
used by both residents and neighbors – a micro  
auditorium and a café in the lower level as well as a  
gallery and work spaces above the open ground floor.  
9  
narchitects\: Carmel Place, New York, 2016  
The project grew out of a publicly funded initiative to  
create affordable housing for the growing number of  
single-person households in New York. 22 of the  
20–33.5 m² apartments are subsidized, 33 are offered at  
market price. The modular, prefabricated micro  
apartments are centrally located in Manhattan and  
complemented by service and other shared facilities.  
increased flexibility has been helpful here\: downsizing has  
become an acceptable option, housing has become more  
temporary or is fundamentally not thought about in perma-  
nent terms, establishing a household and a family is often  
postponed. The number of single-person residences is again  
on the rise and shared accommodation is – beyond one’s  
time as a student – increasingly more attractive 7.  
Micro Apartments  
The development of micro apartments, based on the concept  
of serviced apartments from the hotel sector, is also an  
attempt to create living space in otherwise often unafford-  
able central urban areas. By implementing spatial scenarios  
that change throughout the day and built-in, multifunctional  
furniture like flexible tables, folding beds or compressible  
wardrobes – and at times a conscious removal of ancillary  
functions from the apartment or an increase in available  
resident services – they try to systematically minimize the  
required space for each individual. Their diverse manifesta-  
tions are inhabited by singles, business travelers or com-  
muters\: common among all iterations, however, is that living  
here often remains impersonal and asocial, as residents can  
bring in little personal furniture and it is difficult to entertain  
guests 8, 9.  
Outsourcing  
While such developments are indicative of a new trend in  
many metropolitan areas, they are a long-established stand-  
ard in the cities of Japan. The resulting building configura-  
tions are closely connected to the characteristics of their  
urban context, since original functions of living such as food  
preparation and eating have been in part “outsourced” to the  
public sphere. The forms of the urban and individual spheres  
complement and necessitate one another 10.  
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE\: DIVERSIFICATION  
The increasingly heterogeneous nature of society has led to  
a broad multiplicity of ideas on possible housing forms, a  
multiplicity that still cannot be satisfied by the existing hous-  
ing inventory 11, 12. But having adequate design ideas for  
these other modes of living is not only what matters, rather  
it must be accepted that the permanence of a chosen way  
of life – heretofore simply assumed as a constant – is hardly  
valid anymore.  
The diversification of apartment size, layout and stand-  
ards is an important criterion among all these trends when  
taking a variety of lifestyles and incomes into account. In or-

Riken Yamamoto & Field Shop\: Local Community Area \(theoretical proposal\), 2012  
The “Local Community Area” concept questions the sustainability of the nuclear  
family as the smallest social entity and instead proposes an urban community with  
roughly 500 residents. The relationships between the private and collective spheres  
are completely rethought\: the family is no longer the only basis for shared economic  
activity or mutual and reciprocal care, and the exclusive rights to individual rooms  
are reduced to a minimum in favor of shared areas wherever possible. Two types of  
spaces are offered – for rent only, to ensure that constant adaptation to social  
changes remains a possibility. Open, transparent rooms can be used as commercial  
spaces, offices, studios, or as private verandas, forming an interface with the commu-  
nity. Enclosed units can be occupied as more conventional private households.  
Bathrooms, however, are shared, which is more efficient than providing each unit  
with its own.

development, Bern, 2008  
Shared fl at typology \(2nd fl oor\)  
Day/night area typology \(3rd fl oor\)  
Open living room typology \(4th fl oor\)  
der to potentially expand the choice, a broad range of differ-  
ent apartments – different typologies, sizes, fl oor plans, and  
standards – can be offered within one and the same project.  
Simultaneously, apartments with several access points allow  
for divisions or multiple uses 13, 14, 15.  
The Dominance of the Generic  
Many apartment fl oor plans still often functionally adhere to  
structures developed with the needs of the classic nuclear  
family in mind 16. In particular, large residential complexes  
realized by property developers show little interest in the  
creation of more contemporary fl oor plans – which may  
be due to potential buyers who purchase an apartment  
more as an investment preferring something non-specifi c,  
or that traditional patterns in mass housing are simply  
not questioned. Meanwhile, post-war housing estates are  
increasingly called into question due to the lack of fl exibility  
in their fl oor plans, while the highly esteemed, spacious  
and less defi ned fl oor plans of mid- to late-19th century  
European residential buildings seem to offer more fl exibility  
for changing living arrangements.  
Deprogramming  
Admittedly, too much diversifi cation can also be viewed  
critically, at least when it results in extreme spatial and  
functional determination, which can only be adapted with  
considerable efforts – in contrast to offi ce buildings, for  
example, where neutral fl oors are offered to accommodate  
the individual demands of each user. A small number of  
projects suggest a different path. Use-neutral buildings  
generate structures that incorporate the unpredictability  
of how the property will be utilized long-term, anticipating  
and allowing for uses besides housing, which are to a great  
degree vaguely defi ned and fl exible and may therefore easily  
be reprogrammed 17.  
Alternative models  
It is often up to smaller projects to show new directions that  
not only follow different design strategies, but above all else  
endeavor to establish alternative models of cohabitation,  
connections between working and living, or even property  
development 18, 19.  
Co-Housing  
Co-housing or cooperative building ventures take advantage  
of niches resulting from diversifi cation in the real-estate  
market, and react to the previously mentioned economic  
developments, which would otherwise preclude the par-

and in similar fashion realized in many condominium projects  
in Asian cities. The unit is accessed through the living room,  
from which a hallway leads to extremely compact bedrooms  
on one side, a kitchen and bathroom on the other, and at its  
end a master bedroom with its own bathroom.

ANA\: Multifunk, Amsterdam-Ijburg, 2007  
The multifunctional building “Multifunk” is fl exible both in its  
individual units and in its entirety – apartments can be  
transformed into offi ces and offi ces into apartments. All types  
of fl oor plans are possible\: standard fl oor plans, duplexes,  
lofts, and commercial spaces. The only elements that are fi xed  
are the load-bearing facades, the supply shafts, a series of void  
spaces with clerestory windows, and the access cores.  
Horizontal access, bathrooms and kitchens, loggias and  
additional stairs can be placed as needed. Natural ventilation,  
twin elevator shafts, and generous ceiling heights are further  
prerequisites for this fl exibility.

it was developed as a housing model for the

growing megacities.  
ticipants from finding affordable and adequate housing in  
their preferred locations. In co-housing design, users are  
no longer mere consumers of predefined forms of housing  
but become active participants in the creation of the floor  
plan – both in the act of inhabiting but also in the develop-  
ment of the buildings. Ideas on collective living are thus  
formulated. In these typically rather small collaborative  
housing projects, the inhabitants, while often assuming  
the economic risks for the project, have the opportunity to  
adapt the standard and size of their units to their income  
during the planning and the building stages. They are able  
to realize their individual concepts of living and to form a  
community, even prior to the completion of the building.  
Flexible floor plan structures with intelligently placed load-  
bearing, access and technical structures allow for individual  
floor plan solutions 20, 21.  
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  
Global Urbanization  
According to a prognosis by the United Nations, in 2050,  
two-thirds of humanity will be living in cities worldwide. A  
significant portion of the global population growth will take  
place in urban areas, in particular in the so-called emerg-  
ing economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Migration  
patterns from rural regions to urban areas are primarily  
motivated by economic factors and present challenges to the  
demographic, economic, and social structures of both cities  
and rural areas 22, 23.  
Housing in growing and increasingly more permanent  
informal settlements and similar ways of living require strate-  
gies which – in lieu of demolition and forced resettlement  
of entire neighborhoods into places without any naturally  
evolved structures – build on legalization and participation,  
the stabilization of existing social networks, the creation of  
the necessary infrastructure to provide water supplies, sewers  
and drains, garbage removal, and more; strategies which  
employ simple means to design adequate and better quality  
housing forms with improved living conditions and economic  
possibilities 24.  
Emergency Housing  
The experience of recent years has shown how important  
it is to be prepared with adequate housing strategies for  
the enormous challenges posed by the immigration of  
refugees – whether their forced migration be due to natural  
catastrophes, violent conflict, economic reasons, or the  
consequences of climate change. Affordable, easily produced  
housing has to be created, but there is simultaneously a

Against the backdrop of the massive population migrations to  
large Chinese cities, this house typology was developed as an  
alternative model to lend new vibrancy, sustainability and  
comfort to life in the countryside. By making use of natural  
resources, it sets an example for supply autonomy. The local  
artisanal production that takes place here contributes both to  
the village community and the local economy.

Spurred on by a collectively organized loan, the building lot  
was divided into ten segments, which although individually  
designed, were developed in close collaboration with the  
neighbors. Inspired by a traditional Thai building type, the  
units enclose a common courtyard; kitchens remain open to  
the surroundings to provide better ventilation when cooking,  
facilities like the pool and laundry room are shared.

of an informal settlement. The empty voids between the units  
not only accommodate self-built additions needed for  
changing demands, but also increase the value of the house in  
order to, for example, secure a loan to open a business or  
finance a child’s education.

anticipate their disassembly or conversion, but also whose  
placement and layout avoid the formation of ghettos and

The complexity of all these trends cannot be tackled alone  
with static solutions. A design approach that aims to con-  
stantly identify questions, opportunities, and challenges in a  
spirit of curiosity is far more contemporary and sustainable.  
To this end, this book serves as a resource for reviewing floor

Asian Megacities  
Given their enormous growth, Asian megacities can serve  
as a field for experimentation in path-breaking solutions  
on a large scale, to generate sustainable, alternative ways of  
building for the economic, ecological, and social challenges  
of increasing urban density. This applies both to historic  
quarters, which until now – despite being part of the local  
urban identity – were often demolished to make way for new  
buildings, as well as to the construction of New Towns, which  
have to establish new urban neighborhoods without benefit-  
ting from existing social networks 27, 28.

# The Path toward Access and Circulation  
Access describes the path from the public to the private  
sphere and the space it occupies, which begins with two  
thresholds\: the first is the transition into the building; the  
second leads into one’s own apartment. In between lies an  
entire sequence of spaces with horizontal and vertical con-  
nections, which can present a generous face to the public  
sphere, and either inviting or inhospitable in nature, may  
promote or discourage encounters among neighbors. In con-  
junction with open spaces such as balconies and terraces,  
the access also represents connection to the outside – it is,  
one might say, the prelude to a building. Similarly, it is a filter  
that controls and manages intimacy and allows for highly  
diverse lifestyles in close proximity to one another.  
The word “access” is potentially ambivalent. To begin  
with, it simply describes an architectural space that allows  
residents to enter their private sphere; beyond architecture,  
however, it also describes a kind of taking stock, a step-by-  
step build-up of understanding and acquiring insight into  
complex contexts. According to the “promenade architectu-  
rale” postulated by Le Corbusier, which provides the basis for  
exemplary designs such as the Villa Savoye in Poissy \(1929\),  
the entire configuration of the design is derived from the  
path into and through the house. To the user, the “promena-  
de architecturale” is revealed as a scenic sequence of spatial  
perceptions; however, it is also an element that establishes  
a hierarchy, a kind of unwritten user manual with which the  
structure of the house unfolds and becomes accessible to  
the user by virtue of his movement – step by step.  
The Question of Function  
But what is the function of this space if one thinks beyond  
its pure circulation role and wishes to explore its potential?  
The access space is a spatial and social buffer between a  
complex, anonymous public space and the intimate, indivi-  
dual environments of the residents. Sociologists have coined  
the term living environment for such spaces – an area that  
surrounds the residence, protects it while still being a part  
of it and at the same time providing an additional sphere of  
activity for the residents.  
To regard the access space as no more than a thoroughfare  
is to misjudge its potential. After all, it offers ideal conditions  
for neighborly contact, for in contrast to the public space  
the number of local residents is manageable – an important  
prerequisite for people’s willingness to socialize. Moreover,  
encounters take place out of necessity, as it were, and repeatedly;  
neighborly routines can therefore develop and become estab-  
lished. For children, especially, the access space also functions  
as an open space – located beyond the boundaries of the  
parental apartment but still sheltered. Thus it becomes part  
of their living environment in a most natural fashion – and it  
becomes a space in which they linger.  
The question whether the access space is merely a passage  
space or whether one also enjoys spending time in it, is first  
and foremost in the hands of the residents. They might be  
able to live in the building without the access space as a social  
interface; however, when the space invites this type of use by  
virtue of its architecture and program, it is readily utilized as  
such. The invitation to linger is thus an offer with no strings at-  
tached. If it is accepted, the access space can become a place  
… Inside\: we enter, we walk around and the forms take on meaning, they expand,  
they combine with one another. Outside\: we approach, we see, our interest is  
aroused, we stop, we appreciate, we turn around, we discover. We receive a series of  
sensory shocks, one after the other, varying in emotion. … \[And\] the ‘jeu’ comes into  
play. We walk, we turn, we never stop moving or turning towards things … Note the  
tools we use to perceive architecture\: we have two eyes that can only look forward,  
we can move our heads from side to side and from top all the way to the bottom,  
we can turn our bodies or transport our bodies on our legs, all the while turning.  
The architectural sensation we experience stems from hundreds of different  
perceptions. It is the ‘promenade’, the movements we make that act as motor for  
architectural events.  
Le Corbusier, cited in\: Danièle Pauly\: Le Corbusier\: The Chapel at Ronchamp, 2008  
In the film “Mon Oncle” by Jacques Tati \(1958\), the path is staged of a resident through an old Parisian  
apartment building leading up the stairs to his attic loft. In this case, the pathway space is no longer  
recognizable as a monofunctional access space with clear boundaries, but is entirely interwoven with the  
structure of the building, thus negating a clear hierarchy and separation between access space and  
accessed space. The viewer almost has the impression that the path to his apartment leads through all  
other apartments in the building; the access space thus gains an openness and boundlessness, as if all  
living areas were overlapping.

On the other hand, the access space is invariably in a  
tenuous relationship with the rest of the building, because  
efficiency dictates that it should occupy as little area as possible.  
This is an economic dilemma, especially evident in social  
housing developments where the dictum of economic efficiency  
has resulted in access spaces that are spatially, functionally, and  
qualitatively impoverished. Often, too many units are attached  
to a single access system. As a result, the access system beco-  
mes anonymous and inhospitable and is one of the reasons for  
the social problems arising in buildings of this kind.  
Forms of Access and Circulation  
Shaping the circulation in terms of space and program is one  
of the great challenges in housing. In this context, how to  
deal with the access space also depends on how habita-  
tion is understood and on the question of where habitation  
begins\: in front of the building, behind the front entrance or  
only behind the apartment door?  
Depending on the urban context and the building type,  
the access spaces vary in expanse and complexity\: in the case  
of detached houses and larger housing estates, the houses  
are often surrounded by additional buildings, green spaces or  
common areas – and in some cases shared spaces within the  
buildings – which taken together can be regarded as part of  
this space and its potential. Apartment towers often feature  
lobbies in the entrance area, which deliberately delay the  
transition into the private sphere and invite residents to linger  
for a while. The access space tends to be more compact in  
urban infill developments, where details can play a key role\:  
whether there is a canopy or not, whether the entrance door  
is recessed and thus sheltered from the elements, how the  
threshold is designed, how spacious, bright and inviting the  
space on the inside of the front door is, whether the landings  
are large enough to encourage social interaction, or even  
whether there are opportunities along the way to sit down for  
a brief chat.  
Direct Access from Street or Courtyard  
If apartments are directly connected with either the street  
or a courtyard, each resident has the privilege of having a  
personal entrance. Row houses, for instance, where multiple  
units have direct street access, provide each resident with  
an individual street address, often with a front garden or at  
the very least a front step. Tessenow articulates this area in a  
very subtle manner – running along multiple house fronts is  
a continuous stoop with room enough at the top for a bench.  
The space belongs to the individual unit and acts as a buffer  
despite being in a public setting – ideal circumstances for  
pleasant yet sheltered neighborly interaction.  
In a courtyard, individual units are accessed from a semi-  
public open space either enclosed on all sides or part of an  
open building ensemble. This spatial arrangement forms a  
safe space for communal activities or events, which in turn  
may aid in community development.

interaction.

Access to apartments via footbridges and  
recessed open spaces  
In the project BIGyard, a townhouse typology forms part  
of a block edge development providing each unit with its own  
entrance and a room for potential commercial use despite  
its inner-city location. The garden houses run along the rear  
firewall and are accessed from the shared courtyard\: eat-in  
kitchens form a buffer and threshold between the two.  
Stairs  
A set of stairs is probably the smallest common denomina-  
tor among all residential building access systems. To begin  
with stairs are a mundane, functional building component;  
however, they also serve to stage the passage into the house.  
In baroque architecture, stairs evolved into complex, three-  
dimensional spatial configurations and became the stage  
for social encounters. The path towards the destination was  
artificially prolonged in order to endow the event of the en-  
counter with time and space. In ordinary housing, stairwells  
can be designed in such a fashion as to consciously shape  
and publicly present the connection of residents with their  
environment.  
In Álvaro Siza’s housing development “Full Stop and  
Comma” in The Hague, the stairs define the character of the  
building to a large degree\: access is via a portico – a wide  
set of stairs leads directly from the street to a loggia-like  
space, which is open towards the cityscape and from which  
all apartments are accessible through front doors exclusive  
to each unit.  
Vertical Access Systems  
The most commonly used stairwell in housing consists of  
several stacked flights of stairs that give access to a specific  
number of apartments at each landing\: thus there are stairs  
that provide access to a single unit, two, three, and more  
units per floor. Horizontal access systems are preferred for  
buildings in cases where the number of units per level is too  
high. There are numerous subcategories to these models;  
there are buildings with internal or external stairs, which  
are combined with short horizontal corridors or housed in  
a separate building section. When they are constructed as a  
shaft, vertical access systems of this type can contribute to  
the structural integrity of a building and increase the design  
flexibility within the apartments.  
The ten-story residential building by Henri Ciriani in The  
Hague demonstrates the possibilities of variation for this  
type. The apartments are organized into four units per floor;  
what is remarkable in this case is how the space around the  
sets of stairs expands into an open atrium reaching across all  
floors between the two building wings. On each floor, bridges  
connect to the landings and lead to the loggias projecting into  
the atrium, and it is these loggias that serve as entrance areas  
for the units. Beyond the loggias, the atrium opens onto the  
city, while the comings and goings of the residents become an  
event in its interior.  
The same access type is interpreted in an entirely different  
manner in the project e3 by Kaden Klingbeil\: for reasons of  
fire safety, the stairwell lies in a building component set apart  
from the apartment units. Because the building is comprised  
of a wooden structure, the escape route had to be constructed  
in reinforced concrete and set apart from the main building.  
The open gap gives each apartment a third facade and allows  
for more flexible interior spaces, thanks to the separation of

Hague, 1988  
Raised ground floor with six separate front doors  
Rem Koolhaas refers to a “simple cartoon, … which describes the ideal  
performance of a skyscraper,” with the “skyscraper as a utopian instrument  
for the unlimited acquisition of new territory on a single urban site.” In this  
cartoon, “a slender steel construction … \[supports\] 84 horizontal levels, all  
of which are identical in size to the original lot. Each of these artificial  
levels is treated as a virgin piece of land – as if the other levels did not  
exist – in order to erect a self-contained empire with a single manor as  
focal point …” \(Rem Koolhaas, Delirious New York, 1978/1999\).  
For Koolhaas, this drawing is synonymous with a radical trend toward  
verticality in building, made necessary by the tremendous economic  
pressure on building lots in Manhattan, and made possible by innovative  
skeleton construction.  
In 1853, Elisha Otis installed a spring-loaded brake, which would prevent  
the elevator cabin from falling and crashing in the event of a cable  
rupture. Due to the high crash risk, these vertical transport machines were  
at that time usually reserved for applications in mining and industry. The  
safety mechanism meant that access cores could reach previously  
unattainable building heights, reducing stairs to secondary escape routes  
and allowing for tremendous efficiency in stacking levels.  
In 1854, Otis demonstrated the safety of his braking mechanism at the  
Crystal Palace World‘s Fair exposition in New York City.

the stairwell. Moreover, the access via a footbridge is pushed  
into the urban space and thus emphasized. On three fl oors,  
the apartments are accessed via generous, recessed open  
spaces, which enhances the sense of possessing one’s own  
fl oor and home in the city.  
Circulation as Separation –  
The Invention of the Circulation Core  
In the enclosed circulation cores of larger and higher  
buildings, vertical access systems are taken to the extreme\:  
effective skeleton structures in steel or reinforced concrete  
and elevator facilities allow for extremely tall residential  
buildings with a steady repetition of the building’s hori-  
zontal footprint. It is the use of elevators in access cores  
that radically reduces the amount of time that residents  
spend in this common interface. In this sense, the vertical  
circulation core is the symbol of an autonomous treatment  
of each fl oor and its inhabitants. The fl oors inhabited by  
“others” are merely perceived in a fl eeting glimpse through  
the opening and closing elevator door; residents disembark  
only on their own fl oor.  
There are, however, exceptions to the rule. At Citygate  
Tower in Vienna, a vertical incision in the building provides na-  
tural lighting to the central circulation core, opening it up to a  
view of the city. Additionally, shared and in part double-height  
spaces are inserted into this cut-out void every few fl oors and  
are used for instance as a media room, home theater, laundry  
room, play area or roof terrace.  
Horizontal Connecting Spaces – “Rue Intérieure” and  
“Streets in the Air”  
Central corridors such as the “Rue Intérieure” and external  
access areas such as galleries or “Streets in the Air” are  
horizontal access systems.  
Corridor  
A corridor is a horizontal passage located in a building’s inte-  
rior, which for the most part runs parallel with the building’s  
facade and is lined on both sides by residential units. A  
groundbreaking example of this type of access system is the  
Unité d’Habitation, which emerged as a result of research on  
urban living. Le Corbusier established that it would require a  
minimum of 1,600 residents to create a functioning piece of  
urbanity and it was from this assumption that he derived the  
scale of the Unité – complete with retail strips, communal  
establishments and the so-called “Rues Intérieures.” Located  
on every third fl oor, they provide access to the left and right  
to maisonette units, which occupy the entire width of the  
building on the fl oors above or below. In contrast to the  
galleries, these interior streets have virtually no relationship  
with the surroundings\: running the entire length of the  
building, dark and with low ceilings, they failed to achieve  
the effect of a lively streetscape.  
Van den Broek and Bakema’s residential high-rise in  
Berlin also features an internal street. However, in this case  
it receives natural light from two sides and opens onto a  
two-story shared loggia on the south side with sun decks  
and playground terraces. The number of units along each  
corridor is manageable in this case. Spatially and program-  
matically, the access area is thus intentionally designed as a  
communal area.

Access Gallery  
An access gallery is generally speaking a path projecting from  
one side of a building, usually on the outside, and connected  
to one or several vertical circulation cores. Many of the built  
examples fall into a predictable pattern\: the gallery is often  
located on the side disadvantageous for living spaces –  
depending on the geographic location, this may be the side  
with too little or too much sunlight. In heavily trafficked  
areas it may also serve as a noise barrier. It is sometimes set  
slightly lower than the floor level or else accompanied by  
horizontal windows set high into the wall to ensure privacy.  
The kitchen, entrance hall, and sanitary block are often  
placed parallel to the gallery as an intermediary zone bet-  
ween it and the more private living areas, which run along  
the more attractive side of the building. This type of access is  
often employed in conjunction with maisonette units\: within  
a spatial unit comprising several stories, galleries provide  
access to the entrance area on one level of the maisonette,  
which continues on the floor above or below. On this floor,  
front-to-back interiors are thus possible. On the lower  
floors, maisonette units can be arranged with ground floor  
entrances, thus allowing for access from private front gardens  
similar to a row house.  
Alison and Peter Smithson adopted the term “Streets in  
the Air” – borrowed from the idea of the urban street based on  
traditional images – to describe their generous galleries.  
They were proclaimed as a deliberate alternative to Le  
Corbusier’s “Rue Intérieure” – the interior access corridors they  
criticized in the Unité d’Habitation. To the architects, the term  
“Streets in the Air” expresses their program\: on the one hand, the  
building is interpreted as a small piece of city in its own right, and  
on the other hand, it illustrates the idea that access areas can  
serve as urban spaces for socializing with neighbors. Although  
their project Robin Hood Gardens in London ultimately revealed  
the limitations of access systems of this kind – the galleries pro-  
ved to be inhospitable and anonymous due to the sheer number  
of units and the exposure to the noises of the highly trafficked  
surroundings – the spatial relationship between housing unit  
and gallery is nevertheless exemplary. Nearly 2 meters wide, the  
galleries expand into even wider bays in front of each entrance,  
creating a kind of forecourt. The apartment doors are set side-  
ways into the resulting niche, further enhancing this entrance  
area. The apartment stairs lie parallel to the gallery and create a  
buffer between horizontal access and the housing unit. Internally,  
the stairs connect the common rooms, kitchen, and living rooms,  
which are deliberately located on different levels to avoid a strict  
separation of common and private spaces.  
Taking the private sphere within an access space into  
consideration and providing each unit with its own anteroom  
can also become a unique quality of the common access  
space. In the Kölner Brett by b & k+ in Cologne, the access area  
is deliberately set apart as an independent sculptural element,  
with the result that access to the units is only possible via  
bridges. At the same time, the galleries are notable for their  
width and inviting spaces; they integrate balconies, patios, and  
even gardening areas.

ments, but instead enclose spaces either singularly or with

The apartments are not merely accommodations strung along corridors, but lively habitats  
along “alleys” and open toward the external spaces in front of and behind the apartments.  
The ”alleys” lead into the ”street,” the ”street” unifies spaces, the main purpose of which is  
the development of community and the relationship with the outside.

Diener & Diener Architekten\: KNSM- & Java-eiland, Amsterdam, 2001 MVRDV & Blanca Lleó Associates\: Mirador, Madrid-Sanchinarro, 2005  
Internal street in open multi-story atrium, and longitudinal section with various access  
systems and 4-story open communal garden at a height of 40 m  
an opposite, the impression of a shared communal space  
emerges that allows for visual and neighborly contact.  
The galleries of “Juliet,” part of Hans Scharoun’s “Ro-  
meo and Juliet” twin housing complex in Stuttgart, can be  
overlooked and controlled from every vantage point thanks to  
their curved shape, which seems to almost form a circle and  
interior courtyard. By means of the intelligent shaping of the  
gallery balustrade and the exterior walls of the apartments,  
which usually run parallel to each other, each entrance lies in  
a triangular bay, enclosed on two sides and seemingly giving  
each unit an anteroom of its own. At the transition to the  
vertical access at the center, the gallery widens into a generous  
front-to-back space, with a large balcony facing towards the  
other side, inviting contact among neighbors.  
Atrium  
Similarly, an atrium uses access galleries on every floor that  
flank an open, naturally lit space and connect – whether  
covered or not – the horizontal and vertical access systems  
in a singular space, which also usually serves as a source of  
natural light. In the atrium-like access space of the residen-  
tial building by Diener & Diener in Amsterdam, the vertical  
access elements are arranged at the peripheral gallery in  
such an intelligent way that one passes no more than one  
other unit on the way to one’s own apartment. The place-  
ment of the floor-to-ceiling glazed eat-in kitchens at the  
transition between the public and private spheres lets life  
inside the apartment merge naturally with the communal life  
of the building as a whole.  
Complex Access Systems  
In some housing schemes, an intentional effort is made to  
go beyond a single access system; they are conceived as  
complex systems and as such permeate the spatial hierarchy  
of the entire building. One example for the combination of  
several access systems is the superblock Mirador; it inte-  
grates horizontal and vertical access routes, which – again  
and again – lead to communal spaces. Access cores project  
openly into the cityscape and lead to loggias cut into the  
corners. Internal streets provide access to maisonette units  
and, at the very top, become part of a multi-story open-air  
atrium. At the center of the high-rise, several access routes  
open simultaneously onto a dramatic five-story courtyard,  
which can be used by all residents as a common space offer-  
ing an urban panorama.  
In the high-rise cluster of Walden 7, a spatially complex  
network of pathways spans vertically and horizontally through  
a series of courtyards. Starting at the centrally placed eleva-  
tors, numerous spatial situations and chances for neighborly  
encounters are experienced along the path to each individual  
apartment. The more generously dimensioned courtyards with  
entrances to the units broaden in section at their middle, thus  
allowing for a multitude of views.  
In such cases the access system is simply a space so at-  
tractive that one happily accepts a delay en route to one’s own  
apartment and is thereby drawn into the building‘s community  
– casually and only when desired.

Typical floor plan with shared space, and section  
Instead of banning the emergency staircases to a dark structural  
core, in Torre Júlia they are positioned in opposite corners of the  
building and intentionally left open – with generous staircases  
and balcony-like landings offering a view of the city. Roof  
terraces, the entrance lobby and well-lit, open corridors connect  
both staircases and the apartment entrances and in doing so  
create an inviting pathway that encourages residents to walk  
through the building and visit each other. Multiple floors are  
color-coded and share one of the three double-height  
community spaces. The top room is reserved for laundry while  
the others are left open to interpretation.

# The Floor Plan Idea  
A floor plan idea reflects the interpretation of a certain  
notion of living. It is expressed in the internal organization,  
in the opening and closing of the rooms, in the connection  
and grouping of rooms, in the connection or isolation of  
functions and, last but not least, in paths and sightlines.  
Some floor plans subordinate everything to the spatial idea  
\(cf. “Dividing Elements”\), while others emphasize the link  
between the spaces, and optimize or celebrate the internal  
path \(cf. “Floor Plan with Circular Path”\). A floor plan may also  
articulate an apartment as a “space of social interactions”\:  
in this case, the spaces are assessed on a scale from highly  
communicative \(social\) to extremely private, and the floor  
plan is arranged accordingly. The result can be a largely bal-  
anced mix \(cf. “Zoning”\) or a type that gives priority to privacy  
\(cf. “Corridor“\), or, conversely, a floor plan in which the com-  
municative aspect of cohabitation dominates \(cf. “The Living  
Room as Circulation Center”\). These social interactions natu-  
rally influence how every floor plan is organized. However,  
since they cannot be assumed to be constant or universal in  
nature, new attempts are always being undertaken to render  
floor plans modifiable, open to multiple interpretations \(cf.  
“Flexible Floor Plan”, “Neutral Spaces”\) or even involve the  
future user in the design process from the beginning \(cf.  
“User-defined Floor Plans”\).  
The following classification is an instrument for reading  
and designing floor plans, whereby it must be noted that the  
pure type should not be mistaken for the best type\: for truly  
exciting solutions most often lie at the intersections of these  
categories.

CORRIDOR/HALL  
The apartment is organized along an axis, with the rooms  
arranged in sequence on one or both sides 1, 2. The advan-  
tage of this classic corridor type lies in the opportunity for  
simultaneous use of the rooms; completely enclosed and  
independently accessed, they offer all manner of freedom  
and flexibility for all kinds of users \(families, co-op, etc.\). The  
apartment can be accessed either in the axis or orthogonally  
1, 7\. In both cases, the layout of the apartment is instantly  
visible; a pleasant clarity is achieved. The end point of the  
axis is important, a common room in the best scenario, as is  
the case in example 1\: the corridor widens in the direction  
of the living room. With the balcony in the sightline, spatial  
quality, visual experience and light intensity increase for the  
visitor, walking down the corridor becomes a pleasure. The  
width of the corridor determines to a great degree whether  
it is also suitable for other uses, for example, as a play area;  
natural light in a corridor, in particular, allows for a multitude  
of individual purposes 3. When corridors are no longer simply  
linear but widen into small bays or even entire rooms, for  
example into a wardrobe niche at the entrance door, an  
anteroom in front of bedrooms, or even a dining area 1, 4,  
the experience becomes enjoyable. The corridor is therefore  
wider and more generous in certain areas, but more im-  
portantly, it is structured and thus becomes interesting as  
a room in its own right. Given the linearity of the form, the  
corridor type quickly awakens a need for change in direction  
and widening of the space. Floor plans respond to this need  
in a variety of ways\: with large, open living rooms oriented  
in all directions at the end of the corridor, or sightlines and  
room-to-room relationships set at right angles within the  
corridor 1, 3 and 6. In the classic type, encounters between  
inhabitants in the corridor are inevitable. A second corridor  
preceding the rooms and conceived as a loggia, for example,  
can alleviate this situation by affording a second access 5.  
Similar to the corridor, a hall also provides access to all  
rooms simultaneously and the rooms are also individually  
usable. However, the hall is also distinguished by the fact  
that it welcomes the visitor in the form of a well-designed  
space that is often used to impress the visitor and allows for  
additional functions that the corridor cannot provide\: one  
can set up a table, the space invites you to stay 7.

THE LIVING ROOM AS CIRCULATION CENTER/  
FLOOR PLAN “WITHOUT CORRIDOR”  
The floor plan fans out from and around the living room,  
which is both the center of the apartment and the distribu-  
tion zone \(circulation center\). Nearly all paths lead through  
this room. The living room gains in floor area since less  
corridor space is required; sometimes, individual rooms  
are reduced in size in exchange for a larger living room. The  
concept is exceptionally conducive to communication, but  
it does restrict opportunities for privacy. Hilberseimer refers  
to this type of design as a “cabin system,” Alvar Aalto called  
his all-purpose living room a “market square” emphasiz-  
ing its lively nature. The apartment benefits from having a  
clearly defined center, while the remaining rooms are kept  
neutral with regard to use 1, 2, 3. The living room can also be  
defined as a large continuous hall determined by the spatial  
boundaries of the rooms 4. The paths through the living  
room must be designed in such a manner that the living  
quality is undiminished 5. Some cases feature a separate  
corridor with bathroom leading to the bedrooms. There is, of  
course, no need to place the living room in the geometrical  
center of the apartment 6.

ZONING  
This type of floor plan clearly separates the different func-  
tional areas within an apartment\: it differentiates between  
the common living area including living room, kitchen, and  
dining area, on the one hand, and the bedroom area with  
individual rooms and bathroom on the other 1. Studies or  
home office rooms can form a separate, third zone. The  
goal is to achieve an uninterrupted course of the individual  
functions, which can occur simultaneously and side-by-side;  
the individual member of the family or co-op is given as  
much freedom and privacy as possible. Each area has its own  
hallway, and the hallways are either gathered together at the  
entrance or arranged in sequence. The kitchen often sepa-  
rates the different zones; sometimes a bathroom core, which  
should, if possible, be accessible separately from both the  
common area and the bedroom area, fulfills this separating  
function 2, 3, and 4. However, the living area can also provide  
indirect access to the bedrooms by letting the living room  
hallway lead directly into the bedroom hallway 5. In order  
to achieve privacy even in the case of a direct link between  
living room and bedroom hallway, some plans offer a second  
path to the rooms, which may lead through the kitchen or  
even through the bathroom. The shape of the building can  
be chosen in a manner to ensure that a spatial separation  
of specific areas occurs naturally, for example, in L-shaped  
apartments, double rows 6, apartments arranged around an  
atrium 7, or, of course, maisonette apartments.  
Examples from the 1990s often display a different type  
of zoning\: the “service” spaces of an apartment \(kitchen,  
bathroom, pantry, maisonette stairs\) are bundled in a  
service core, with the living and bedrooms on the opposite  
side 8. This approach bundles the shafts and stacks the  
most noise-prone spaces one above the other. This zone  
is often employed as a buffer to the access area, especially  
when covered walkways or central corridors are used, and  
the rooms lie undisturbed. The latter – no longer squeezed  
between a variety of ancillary rooms – can therefore assume  
a clear, attractively designed form, frequently neutral \(that is,  
flexible\) in character.

DIVIDING ELEMENTS  
Visually, the apartment reads like a large, open space with  
prefabricated dividing elements \(for example, installation  
core, maisonette stairs, wall pieces\). Since the sense of  
space is derived from the large open space rather than the  
dividing elements, these apartments appear generous and  
open despite their real dimensions. To ensure that the core  
\(with kitchen, bath, pantry\) is perceived as a freestanding  
autonomous body, it is often rotated away from the axis  
1\. It guides the movements of the inhabitants, divides the  
paths or allows for a circular route. A pantry or storage room,  
a bathroom, or an installation core can also separate the cor-  
ridors leading to living or bedrooms 1 or separate the living  
room from the bedroom wing 2, while a core with galley  
kitchen and bathroom can structure the link between living  
room and dining room 3. In example 4, a core with a galley  
kitchen, bathroom and integrated hallway structures the  
entire room\: the only room partitions are sliding walls that  
can either enclose or open rooms, depending on the time of  
day or living configuration. In example 5, five large cores even  
accommodate small individual apartments \(with bedrooms,  
kitchenettes and bathrooms\). Through their juxtaposition to  
one another, spacious shared living areas are created with  
differently sized and shaped spaces suitable for various uses.

CONTINUOUS FLOOR PLAN  
The continuous floor plan reduces room boundaries to a few  
walls, which are placed with great care in order to make the  
space dynamic and divide it into specific areas. The rooms  
are rarely separated from the traffic area and hardly at all  
from one another; they merge into each other, open up  
sightlines, extend an invitation to move forward 1. As a re-  
sult, the apartments appear more generous and more open,  
the individual room always relates to the entire space. In  
examples with horizontal interconnectedness 2 and 3, living  
room, dining area, and kitchen blend with the corridors lead-  
ing to the master and children’s bedrooms; the rooms are set  
off from one another. In the case of vertical interconnection,  
this approach results in different room heights and room  
relationships, which increase the desire to move between  
spaces 4. The spatial flow is sometimes enhanced by the  
deliberate use of light, such as placing a source of light at the  
end of a path attracting the visitor to walk in that direction\:  
in example 2, the source of light is provided in the form of  
the glass door leading to the garden; in example 4, it is the  
skylight, the entire house being arranged around a column  
of light. Example 5 is emblematic for the continuous floor  
plan. It is a promenade at its purest\: a single, continuous  
space is structured through branches. Spatial relationships  
and sightlines are deliberately orchestrated through cleverly  
designed bends in the room branches; each branch ends in a  
quiet zone, even without a door as separation.

FLOOR PLAN WITH CIRCULAR PATH/  
EMPHASIZING THE INTERNAL PATH  
This kind of floor plan takes the path through the apartment  
as its theme. It creates the greatest number of functional  
and spatial relationships between different rooms, which  
can be experienced and actively utilized. Each space, each  
room can be reached via two or more paths in this type of  
floor plan. The multitude of possible paths allows the user  
to experience the apartment from ever-new perspectives, it  
appears to be more varied than it actually is. The path often  
circles around a center, for example, an atrium 1, 2. The  
visual contact with the other side ensures that the overall  
layout is clear at all times. The rooms can thus feel like  
“showcases” strung along the route. However, the circular  
path can also make the kitchen and sanitary zone into the  
center 3 or even the stairwell 4. The bedrooms can also lie  
at the center \(cf. “Neutral or Ambiguous Spaces,” bottom  
variant of 2\), in which case they form the internal quiet zone,  
while at the same time functioning as a pass-through zone  
and filter. They can open toward the intimate side of the  
house or the common areas as needed. In examples 5 and 6,  
the individual rooms absorb the traffic area. The rooms are  
arranged in such a manner that the openings in the center of  
the wall surface allow for the “circular path.” The downside of  
this arrangement is that it diminishes the floor area where  
furnishings can be placed and one can assume that these  
openings are left open or closed off by the users according to  
their individual needs.

FLEXIBLE FLOOR PLAN  
The constantly changing user requirements for an apartment  
\(number of users, preference for close proximity/distance,  
live/work dynamic, financial situation\) and the increas-  
ing diversity of forms of living in general have a tenuous  
relationship with the idea of real estate as an “immovable  
property,” which – from an economic perspective – should be  
used by the same occupants for the longest possible time. In  
this case, the favored solution is conversion within the exist-  
ing floor plan rather than a move to another apartment.  
The approaches range from removable room dividers or  
additional rooms that can be connected to one apartment  
or another to changing the shape and size of the rooms by  
means of movable wall elements.  
By means of special removable interior walls, the resi-  
dents of example 2 are always able to fulfill their personal  
demands on the layout. The load-bearing exterior walls allow  
for a high degree of design flexibility \(interior fittings play no  
structural role\), and the shallow depth of the building guar-  
antees adequate lighting for every alternative constellation.  
“Connecting” rooms or groups of rooms require even  
less renovation effort\: rooms with a neutral character \(in  
apartment buildings, these are usually located across from  
the stairwell\) can be added to individual apartments 3. Alter-  
natively, the design is conceived to anticipate different room  
constellations for different living concepts within a house, so  
that several apartments can be easily connected or separated  
into individual units. Separate access to the different levels

and room groupings is here the prerequisite, see example  
3, where the position of the staircase at the entrance to the  
apartments allows four separate units to be combined to cre-  
ate a multi-generational house spanning across all floors.  
While these concepts provide an answer to the needs of  
different life phases \(and require building alterations\), floor  
plans with movable wall elements can immediately react to  
the changing demands on an apartment over the course of  
a day. Such fixtures can take the form of sliding or folding  
doors that disappear into walls\: in the daytime scenario, a  
large, multifunctional room is created by folding away wall  
elements, while at night they are used to close off individual  
rooms 1. The beds are stored during the day \(here\: under  
the raised hallway\), similar to the Japanese living tradi-  
tion. See example 4\: the apartment size can be reduced to  
a minimum as there is no hallway, and no separate living  
or bedrooms otherwise occupied only part of the day; by  
day, the sliding doors of the bedrooms are opened to form  
a continuous living room. Personal items are stored in the  
built-in shelving units. A system of sliding and folding walls  
running both crosswise and lengthwise between short wall  
segments opens up the possibility to continually recombine  
the separate rooms in different ways, so that the apartment  
is open to reinterpretation, both over the course of a day and  
on the whole 5. Similarly versatile, yet without interior walls  
and consisting of only a central core and sliding walls is 6.  
The shape of a dividing element can also be more complex\:  
rotating walls, closets, and room corners achieve surprising  
new spatial forms and connections 7.

NEUTRAL OR AMBIGUOUS SPACES  
In this concept, the use of the space is not predefined by the  
size, form and arrangement of the rooms, which increases  
the opportunities for different uses to come into play for one  
and the same floor plan 1, 2, 3. There is no need to modify  
the apartment in order to meet new requirements \(as is  
the case with the flexible floor plan\); the occupant can and  
indeed must invent his or her own form of living. Personal  
requirements can be met by rearranging the interior. Oc-  
cupants with different ideas on living can realize these ideas  
within the same floor plan model \(greater mix of residents  
within one housing complex\). To this end, the rooms need  
to be of a certain size and proportion and, ideally, with inde-  
pendent access. As a result, more floor area is required for  
corridors and rooms, and the best solutions for this type of  
floor plan are therefore found in more exclusive residential  
buildings. In most cases, the rooms are intentionally indis-  
tinct and able to accommodate a variety of uses. However, it  
would be interesting to explore yet another design approach  
to creating neutral, ambiguous spaces\: instead of creating  
identical rooms with little to no character for the purpose  
of ensuring that they can accommodate the widest range  
of uses, the rooms could also be deliberately designed with  
distinctively different characteristics \(room size and shape,  
light, etc.\), thus inviting a very individual use – as is the case  
in many old buildings, which are once again popular 4.

USER-DEFINED FLOOR PLAN  
Maisonette  
In the end, every resident is involved in determining his or  
her individual fl oor plan through use and furnishings, and in  
particular when it comes to fl exible and neutral fl oor plans.  
Split-Level  
However, in “user-defi ned fl oor plans,” this potential to par-  
ticipate in the design is dramatically extended\: for instance,  
in self-build scenarios, where the user “fi nishes” building the  
apartment, or in participatory fl oor plan design, where a fl oor  
Zugang von Straße  
plan is designed in cooperation with the architects. Both  
strategies provide the resident with a high level of personal  
identifi cation with the apartment, since he or she helped de-  
sign it, and the shape, size, Zugang vom Hof  
furnishings, and price are suited  
to the user’s current life situation. Because the structure of  
the house was devised to accommodate changes, the user  
is able to modify the fl oor plan again in the future – and in  
doing so stick around a bit longer.  
Spänner  
In order to allow for such self-determination in a multi-  
unit residential building, architects generally design a basic  
building structure, which can facilitate numerous changes  
Mittelgang  
in the facade, interior walls and fi ttings due to the well-  
thought-out positioning of load-bearing elements, circula-  
tion areas, and building services. In smaller projects, archi-  
tects can invent a personalized fl oor plan directly with input  
Laubengang  
from the future users, for instance, if they form a Baugruppe  
– a joint building group – ahead of time and work together  
as one client. Beyond their individual apartments, members  
have a say in how the entire development and the shared  
Atrium  
spaces should be designed, and the opportunity to realize  
new living concepts. Example 2 illustrates the point\: by  
inserting lightweight wooden walls on each level, individual  
fl oor plans can be created within the concrete skeletal struc-  
ture. In order to minimize the coordination efforts with the  
future residents, architects can create a catalogue of options  
to choose from, which can be modifi ed 3. Example 4 is an ex-  
treme case, in which a “residential shelving unit” is fi lled with  
individually designed apartments developed by the residents  
with the aid of multiple, independent architects. The result is  
a side-by-side juxtaposition of very different living concepts  
and styles \(and social mix\).  
In self-build scenarios, the design is created so that ex-  
pansion is not only possible, but encouraged\: to some extent,  
the apartment/house is handed over in an “unfi nished” state.  
Such a concept is particularly suited for low-budget situa-  
tions. The architect specifi es the structure and design in such  
a way that the user is free to fi nish the rest on his or her own,  
either in consultation with the architect, or with the aid of  
instruction manuals. In the case of the “growing house,” only  
the circulation core \(which is load-bearing and contains the  
building services\) is handed over to the user. The house can  
then unfold step-by-step both vertically and horizontally 1. In  
example 5, two-story enclosures of space were handed over  
to the residents – kitchens, bathrooms, stairs, and gallery  
levels are added as desired; the accompanying handbook  
explains how the support system works and presents further  
examples of possible building elements. For example 6,  
residents to complete the entire fl at \(including the exterior  
walls\) in an affordable way.  
a construction manual describes the building steps and  
techniques \(for example, brick-laying\), thus empowering the

MAISONETTE  
The fl oor plan typology of a maisonette is characterized  
by the apartment stretching across several full fl oors. It is  
usually two stories high, rarely more. As a building type, the  
maisonette is above all dedicated to the idea of zoning\: the  
two-story layout facilitates a spatial separation of specifi c  
functions. At the same time, two-story atria are often an  
impressive feature of maisonettes. The apartment with its  
connecting stairs, which can be designed with great fl ex-  
ibility, feels generous and spacious\: one has a sense of being  
in a house of one’s own. The stairs and the internal path can  
be staged in the manner seen the stairwell often widens so that the entrance area, kitchen,  
2  
in example 1, where the open  
stairs change direction on each fl oor and also serve as a  
room divider between living room and kitchen. Atria are also  
employed to merge the different levels\: the clear height in  
and dining area communicate with the bedroom wing, as  
seen in example 2. Conversely, this air well can also extend  
to the size of an entire room 3. But it can also be entirely  
separated from the stairs themselves, as in example 4, where  
a set-back dining gallery overlooks the living room below. A  
generous sense of space can also be achieved by not simply  
stacking the living levels between two partitions, but by ar-  
ranging them in a staggered form. In this case, the apartment  
extends not only across several fl oors but also across several  
structural units 5. This multiplies the views and suggests

multi-story buildings, the maisonette type is often found  
in combination with a central corridor or covered walkway,  
because it allows for undisturbed front-to-back interiors  
despite the orientation to one side only on the entrance  
level. The entrance is usually located at the level where the  
common rooms are; kitchen, living, and dining room then  
function as a filter and protect the private sphere, even the  
stairs can serve as a buffer to the access path \(see 6\). How-  
ever, the entrance can also be located at the bedroom level.  
This is often the case in center-corridor types, where only  
half of the building width is available at the entrance level. In  
this scenario, the stairs are designed and placed in a manner  
that draws the visitor directly into the living space 7.  
The scissor-shaped floor plan, a variation of the “back-to-  
back, crossover”-type, is a unique form 8. In it the functions  
are bundled and stacked\: a central corridor divides the  
house into two halves, for example, a living area that is more  
prone to noise and a quiet bedroom area. On one side, the  
corridor provides access to apartments with their living area  
at entrance level; on the other side it opens to apartments  
that have their sleeping area at this level; within each flat a  
set of internal stairs leads up to the next level and crosses  
the corridor to reach the other half of the house, where the  
second part of the apartment is located \(with living room  
or bedroom, respectively\). Each apartment is thus identi-  
cal in structure and orientation, profiting equally from the  
advantages of the different sides of the building in terms of  
view or light.

SPLIT-LEVEL  
Split-level is a floor plan type in which the apartment is usu-  
ally distributed across at least three \(often five to six\) levels,  
staggered in half-level steps. The connecting stairs tend to  
be short, the levels small; what is at play here is a constant  
progression upward, the pleasure of how the spaces flow into  
one another as the path winds through the apartment – the  
qualities of the continuous floor plan. In extreme cases, each  
room, each function has its own level. Views into rooms and  
across spaces, sightlines of all kinds combined with a fine-  
tuned spatial separation characterize this type. Since one is  
constantly looking at the apartment from new positions, it  
can appear to be very diversified within a minimum of space.  
This type is often used when different functions must be ac-  
commodated in one apartment, for a room can be specifically  
designed in size and height for each of these functions and  
accordingly connected to a greater or lesser degree to the  
other activities in the home. Split-levels are most commonly  
used on narrow lots, for row housing, high-rises or in a build-  
ing gap, and especially on hillsides where the topography  
can thus be utilized to best advantage. The internal stairs are  
centrally located, with landings of identical or different sizes  
for differing functions. The common rooms – following a  
sequence of entrance, kitchen, dining area, and living room –  
tend to transition seamlessly in a typical split-level plan. The  
spatial continuum is thus palpable and emphasized. At the  
same time, this generates a contradiction between deliberate

openness and the need for withdrawing into a private sphere,  
to which each split-level floor plan must respond. One possi-  
bility is to place the stairs with oversized landings, which can  
serve for different work and living activities, apart from the  
main levels of the unit, separating them to a greater or lesser  
degree from these levels. The facing between the levels and  
the stairs becomes more and more closed with the increasing  
height of the building and the increasing need for intimacy  
called for by the uses \(of the levels\). Thus it is possible to opti-  
mize the degree of isolation provided 1. An atrium next to the  
stairs can further enhance the appeal of wandering through  
the apartment, as in example 2. Here, the atrium creates gen-  
erous sightlines between the levels and the stairs all the way  
to the roof patio. The stairs, now merging with the main living  
areas, can also be closed off from these, creating a separate  
stairwell thanks to the careful placement of the stairs within  
the layout. Thus, when the requirements for use change, new  
individual rooms with separate access can be easily created  
\(this is contrary to the prejudice that split-level types offer no  
flexibility\). The split-level type can also be employed strategi-  
cally, as in example 3. Here, several different split-level apart-  
ments unfold across three levels around the stairwell core of  
the multifamily home, whereby all three levels have a private  
entrance, some from the floor landing and some from the  
mezzanine landing. This independent access opens up new  
possibilities for subdividing the apartment and for different  
uses such as subletting, flats for adult children, in-law apart-  
ments, housing for a caregiver, or a home office space.

# A Graphic Approach to Floor Plan Design  
The Floor Plan Manual Housing builds to some extent on  
a kind of knowledge acquisition whose form is probably  
specific to designers\: namely the ability to draw independ-  
ent conclusions from the projects of others for use in  
one’s own design work without simply copying them. Nigel  
Cross\* argues that architectural knowledge is embedded  
in designs, and that architects are capable of deciphering  
projects and drawing conclusions from concrete examples  
about the underlying demands and design intentions.  
What can be deciphered here are essential aspects of the  
design, for instance, functional relationships, experiential  
qualities, or the relationship between an individual and  
the community – all of which are issues solved by the  
spatial configuration of a plan.  
In this essay, an attempt is made to illustrate graphic  
methods of approaching some of these overarching spatial,  
functional, or social criteria, enabling their exploration at an  
early stage so they can be used to develop design intentions  
before they are confined to an architectural form. The fol-  
lowing two themes, “Before Use” and “Before Form,” describe  
two fields of application of this approach, the first morpho-  
logical in nature, the latter more organizational. A definitive,  
all-encompassing strategy for designing a floor plan is not  
the goal here – and should continue to remain part of each  
individual design strategy.  
BEFORE USE  
The following studies investigate spatial aspects of floor  
plan designs that in principle can be defined independently  
of how these are later utilized. The example of the Palazzo  
Antonini by Palladio \(see also page 8\), but also mid- to late-  
19th-century European floor plans as well as emphatically  
use-neutral designs 1 show that to a certain degree func-  
tional specifications were simply not considered – or were  
intentionally avoided – and that floor plans have and can be  
developed on the basis of a spatial order alone.  
Structuring the Depths of Buildings  
Simple graphic studies on the spatial organization of a hous-  
ing unit as it relates to the depth of the building 2 can help  
bring different aspects in relation to one another in such a  
way that an initial schema for the design of the floor plan  
can be formulated. The basis for such studies is formed by  
an initial assessment of the total living area within a grid as  
a placeholder for rooms or spatial units, which in a second  
step are laid out in spatial layers either parallel or perpen-

Figure-ground studies Studies on spatial structure  
dicular to the facade, depending on the building depth. The  
following can then be illustrated in a basic schema\:  
—  
The depth of the units \(as represented by the number of  
tiers, i.e., the spatial layers parallel to the facade\), their width  
\(as represented by the number of spatial layers transverse to  
the facade\) as well as their height by the number of horizon-  
tal levels.  
—  
The potential orientations of each unit\: if, in the given  
context, the particular unit can be oriented on one, two,  
or even more sides to natural light and a view of the  
surroundings.  
—  
The determination of spaces that need or can do without  
natural light – particularly relevant for units oriented to one  
side only or with an increased number of dark room tiers.  
In the subsequent design steps, one can work out how  
the floor plan can potentially be organized and the functions  
allocated – whether, for instance, in a very deep floor plan  
the unlit groups can be used as hallways and enclosed bath-  
rooms, how the sequence of rooms in an apartment with  
a single spatial layer can be arranged, or in which field the  
vertical access of a multi-story unit should be placed.  
A Sequence of Rooms as a Graphic Composition  
Diagrams in the style of figure-ground drawings can help de-  
velop ideas on composition, room sequences or experiences.  
They form spatial compositions of enclosed volumes and  
empty spaces with a specific rhythm and relationship to one  
another, as dualities of open and closed, light and dark 3.  
Another aspect can be taken into account\: black can be  
used for designating closed areas such as storage or sanitary  
rooms and white for common areas.  
Even structural studies that make use of grids as well as  
linear or pointwise elements to develop structural strategies  
can simultaneously generate initial spatial hierarchies as  
basic, abstract systems 4.  
Room Patterns  
Schematic studies can develop patterns for spatial juxtaposi-  
tions and the way they connect to one another. In a following  
step, each proximal relationship can then be formulated in  
more detail into direct connections – the more spaces adjoin  
a room \(for instance, by offsetting them to one another\) the  
greater the connective potential 5.  
5  
Studies on the juxtaposition of spaces  
Such figure-ground and structural studies as well as  
patterns of spatial juxtaposition can generate schemes  
which, when subjected to a subsequent layering of functions  
and activities, can be post-rationalized, or more precisely  
formulated. Even at this stage, these schemes can work with  
approximate room sizes.  
Spatial Experiences  
Working with spatial sketches, which are often produced  
only at the end of the design, can help to conceive of floor  
plans in situational terms, for instance, to consider how  
visually permeable an apartment is, or how it can potentially  
forge a connection between its residents and the immediate  
surroundings. The sketches by Alison and Peter Smithson on  
page 12 show the value of such sketches 6.

Examples of functional diagrams  
BEFORE FORM\: ACTIVITIES, FUNCTIONS,  
AND RELATIONSHIPS  
Besides these rather spatial and morphological considera-  
tions, a floor plan can also be devised from purely abstract  
relational patterns with a view of, for instance, the organiza-  
tion of functions or activities, as well as the organization and  
prioritization of relationships between the individual and the  
collective.  
Functional Diagrams  
A convention of such preliminary analyses is the devel-  
opment of a functional diagram. This starts with taking  
inventory of the number and approximate dimensions of  
the rooms, their functions, and their resulting division into  
serving and served rooms, those requiring natural light and  
those that can do without. In a diagram, the relationships  
between the individual rooms to one another and to their  
surroundings are devised using connecting lines. The rooms  
are grouped and categorized hierarchically according to their  
functions, placed in either peripheral zones or in the center.  
Additionally, the interfaces with the surrounding context  
as well as the exterior orientation of the rooms to specific  
environmental conditions, such as direct sunlight, noise, or

the public sphere, can be indicated. A spatial scheme begins  
to emerge, in which a preliminary organizational system is  
illustrated without too much formal or dimensional deter-  
mination 7.  
Activities instead of Functions  
In a diagram by Kiyoyuki Nishihara\*, a concept for room con-  
figurations is illustrated, which despite being based originally  
on traditional Japanese lifestyles, presents a transferrable  
alternative model to the functional diagram. The practice of  
flexible use in traditional Japanese housing – some of the  
rooms in his diagram are named only by their proximity to  
one another, not according to their functions – inspired him  
to take a closer look at the activities of the residents instead  
of focusing on the functions of the individual rooms. He  
defined six essential activities that cover the entire complex-  
ity of domestic life\: gathering – eating – cooking – sleeping  
– working – washing and relieving oneself 8.  
Localization of Activities  
While Nishihara’s graphic inquiries analyzed pre-existing  
situations, allocating activities can also form the basis for  
a floor plan design. Intentions can be formulated early on\:  
rooms can be flexibly used for a number of activities; cook-  
ing, dining and gathering can be combined; all residents can  
work in one space, or in their own rooms. Simultaneously,  
these classifications allow conclusions to be drawn on  
how important certain rooms are for the overall structure,  
how open they should be and whether they are mono- or  
multifunctional 9.  
The Integrity of Floor Plan Organization  
The term ’integrity’ is used by Julienne Hanson\* to examine  
the floor plans of existing residential units as matrices of  
a spatially organized social framework. Emanating from  
the idea that the design of a spatial configuration always  
goes along with an attempt to formulate a specific balance  
between common and individual demands, the studies on  
integrity analyzed the level of connectedness between rooms  
within a unit and along its periphery, as it is precisely at  
these junctures that encounters are structured using spatial  
means.  
Integrity as a Design Question  
Such aspects – such as how the transition between public  
and private spheres is formulated, whether rooms are linked  
directly or through intermediate spaces such as corridors,  
whether they branch off in different directions or create cir-

The permeability of thresholds  
cular paths, or how thresholds are composed – can be taken  
into consideration before a concrete spatial design is drawn  
up in order to form clear intentions and ideas on cohabita-  
tion before a floor plan is devised. The aspects presented  
in the following examples and graphic codes, as well as the  
resulting diagrams on spatial integrity are for illustrative pur-  
poses only. Ultimately, this type of graphic instrument should  
be customized for each individual design strategy.  
—  
Public-private Gradient  
The gradual transition from more common, public areas to  
rather intimate private areas can be structured with a series  
of spatial situations. Differently spaced hatches can be used  
to indicate different levels of exposure \(in this case\: the  
more dense, the more private\). When such transitions both  
within an apartment and in relation to its surroundings are  
indicated with lines in different directions, the design of such  
junctures can also be considered 10.  
—  
Differentiation between Branching and Circular Spatial  
Connections  
Connections that branch off – with only one link per room –  
threaten to turn rooms into isolated dead ends. The facilita-  
tion of circular paths with multiple connections per room  
increases both the social potential and the functional flex-  
ibility of an apartment, but can possibly come into conflict  
with the demands of individual intimacy 11.  
—  
Circulation Spaces  
A supplementary differentiation can help to decide whether  
the spatial distribution should be organized using actual  
rooms \(the living room, for example\) or intermediate spaces  
\(such as corridors\) 12.  
—  
The Permeability of Thresholds  
Depending on the relationship between the shared and the  
private sphere, transitions can be formulated using buffer  
zones, closed walls, variable or somewhat hidden connec-  
tions, or even open ones \(like a niche adjacent to another  
room\) 13.  
Diagram for the Assessment of Spatial Integrity  
Combining such aspects and their schematic organiza-  
tion into a single diagram can help to visualize a matrix of  
cohabitation, which in a further step can be transformed into  
a floor plan design 14.  
VERIFICATION  
Working with diagrams can also take place while more  
concrete design work on a floor plan has already begun – as  
a verification measure. In this example, one aspect is con-  
sidered\: the examination of possible alternative occupancies  
within a unit for different resident constellations 15. The type  
and number of connections, assessment of privacy, and the  
degree to which rooms are predetermined can be adjusted  
depending on the results of such verification measures.  
It is always helpful to transfer projects – even ones at  
a much more advanced stage in the design process – back  
into such abstract graphic illustrations in order to reassess  
important qualities such the organization of the community  
or the structure of spatial connections.

# BLOCK EDGE  
# The urban block forms the common context for the  
# following chapters on block edge, urban infi ll, and  
# fi rewall buildings. While in European cities, the closed  
# block edge remains the dominant form, urban blocks  
# can also be occupied with buildings offset from one  
# another along the street or even in larger ensembles.  
# For the most part, city blocks and their buildings are  
# not developed simultaneously, and often the building  
# parcels in a block belong to multiple owners. The build-  
# ings within a block are therefore often very different  
# from one another, even if they have similar dimensions.  
# Block-edge developments close one or more  
# sides of an existing urban block. The building design  
# is thus free and “unfree” at the same time\: “unfree”  
# with regard to the specifi ed block, its street layout,  
# orientation, height, building depth, and the size of the  
# courtyard, yet free with regard to the decision whether  
# the line of the street front should be preserved or  
# structured with a setback, broken up by staggered vol-  
# umes or whether the block interior should be opened  
# through a gap.  
# A building in an urban block has essentially two  
# orientations\: to the street and to the courtyard, where-  
# by factors like orientation, view, and exposure to noise  
# are often at odds with one another. Due to the lack of  
# light and insuffi cient separation from the street, the  
# ground fl oor is reserved for commercial uses whenever  
# possible; alternatively it is laid out as a maisonette and  
# combined with a private green space.  
# In several situations, block-edge developments  
# deviate from existing urban dimensions, for example,  
# when they occupy entire streets or even blocks within  
# a context of otherwise individually developed parcels.  
# In this way, they offer the opportunity to experiment  
# with contemporary housing solutions within the exist-  
# ing urban layout. Since they are greater in scale than  
# infi ll developments, it is possible for each project to  
# develop patterns of its own and to work with more  
# complex access systems. This building type allows for  
# all types of fl oor plans and makes it possible to play  
# with a broad range of fl oor plan types in one project.  
1.1 Girasol | Coderch / Valls | 1966  
Instead of creating a large courtyard, the  
street facade was dissolved into a rhythm  
of rounded, solid projections and open  
perforations, which allow daylight and  
the life of the city to penetrate deep into  
the apartments like a filter. Thanks to  
the rotation, the building appears to be  
composed of individual stacked volumes,  
thus setting it apart from the constraints  
of the urban block. The retail spaces on  
the ground floor are followed by a mez-  
zanine level with vegetation\: it serves  
as a horizontal circulation level to the  
seven \(or eight\) apartment levels and also  
acts as a calming filter. The floor plan is  
divided into three sections\: the service  
area with separate access lies to the rear,  
followed by the elongated living area – for  
which the central elevator offers a formal  
prelude – and parallel to the this space  
a sequence of individual rooms with  
bathrooms. The front-to-back living area  
reaches from the patio on the courtyard  
side to the street facade, where it is  
extended by a room-size exterior space.  
Depending on weather conditions, this  
space can be opened toward the outside  
or toward the interior, entirely at the deci-  
sion of the users. Raised by a few steps  
and at right angles to this space are the  
loggias in front of the individual rooms.  
They are stepped back to ensure that all  
interior spaces have a connection with the  
outside. The dividing walls between the  
flats are the characteristic feature. They  
are found throughout the apartments and  
continue on the outside, materializing  
in the form of a ceramic skin, stretching  
into a protective curve, followed by a fluid  
transition into a homogeneous layer of  
light, wooden venetian blinds. The result\:  
from the street perspective, there is very  
little evidence of the residential activities,  
which remain discrete, almost hidden  
behind an envelope of material and form.

The three-winged block-edge development  
does not connect to the adjacent buildings,  
thereby creating a passage for an avenue  
of trees, which precedes the block to the  
north \(see page 76\). The short end sides  
are occupied by corner maisonettes and  
are thus articulated by openings that over-  
look the passage on one side and the city  
on the other, entirely different than would  
be the case with a standard compartment  
wall. In the north-south facing standard  
floor plan a, the hallway is characterized  
by the intersection of two directions, one  
orthogonal and the other diagonal. The  
hallways, thus connects entrance and  
living room, living room and sleeping area  
and also links bathroom, WC, and kitchen  
to the center area. In the corner type with  
central access, the diagonal divides four  
units, but it also characterizes the larger  
apartments in a subtle way b. By turning  
into the diagonal, the dining area expands  
the living room, and in the other direction  
it links up with the kitchen and the log-  
gia. The hallway is thus the focal point of  
a circular internal path. One of the small  
one-room apartments c overlooking the  
street can be integrated to create a larger  
unit. The flats in the east-west wings d are  
laid out on a cruciform plan with a central  
hall. In the longitudinal direction, this hall  
is defined by two room enclosures in front  
of the sanitary- and the stairwell core,  
respectively, and parallel hallways on both  
sides along which the rooms are lined up.  
Crosswise, two identical verandahs link  
the spacious hall to the street and the  
courtyard. The floor plan is symmetrical in  
structure, but allocated to different func-  
tions.

# Diener & Diener | 1985  
The block-edge completion is  
adapted to the texture of the  
city and makes reference to  
the existing parcel structure in  
the structure of its facade and  
plan. A footpath between the  
new and the old development  
connects to the arcade of the  
block on the Bläsiring \(see page  
74\). Office areas at the corners  
and retail spaces on the ground  
floor complete the scheme.  
Each of the three block edges  
is characterized by a unique  
floor plan type. The north-south  
facing maisonettes a are ar-  
ranged around an open atrium.  
On the lower level, the rooms  
located on the courtyard and  
street side form a representative  
enfilade in combination with  
the atrium. The sanitary zones  
and the individual rooms on the  
upper level are clearly separated  
from this spatial sequence. In  
the east-west facing five-room  
apartments b, the diagonally  
placed kitchen and the sanitary  
zone divide a continuous com-  
mon room into entrance hall,  
a hallway facing towards the  
individual rooms overlooking  
the street, and living room and  
dining area. On the courtyard  
elevation, the building volume is  
characterized by recesses toward  
which the stairwell, hallways, and  
kitchens are oriented. Within the  
three-room apartments c in the  
block edge on the opposite side  
a slightly rotated core with bath-  
room, storage space, and kitchen  
row divides the living and sleep-  
ing area hallway. The building  
volume is recessed on two sides.  
The kitchen is thus lit from two  
sides and is transformed into  
a unique space, although it is  
located at the far end of the  
unit. Kitchen and living room are  
positioned in a manner to create  
a continuous spatial sequence  
from one end of the building to  
the other.

77 Full Stop and Comma | Siza | 1988  
The hope here was to breathe new life into  
a decrepit working class neighbourhood by  
introducing new and international archi-  
tecture. Siza and Castanheira studied the  
structure of the quarter and reinterpreted  
it in their design. They borrowed building  
heights, materials \(various colors of brick\)  
and access type from the surroundings.  
The closed building form is broken at the  
corners to permit inner courtyard entry  
and space for low corner shops. Typical  
access is here the “portico”; steps lead  
directly from the street to a landing from  
which all but the ground floor apart-  
ments are reached by individual interior  
stairways. This means that each apart-  
ment door can be seen from the street, an  
important safety feature for the residents.  
Apartment doors open into a corridor  
which leads to kitchen, living room, bath-  
room, and a further bedroom hallway. This  
hallway gives access to either two or three  
bedrooms and a bath. The floor plans were  
tailored to suit the customs of practicing  
Muslims, as they represent the majority  
of the project’s residents. It was therefore  
necessary to provide for corridors through  
which women could move freely between  
bath and bedroom unseen by men in the  
living room. Hence the strict separation of  
living and sleeping areas and the interior  
door between bath and toilet. By opening  
sliding walls, other residents can expand  
the living room into the entrance hall.

Building row with front gallery behind  
noise protection wall of large glass pan-  
els. The gallery also provides a link to  
the housing units at the end of the row.  
Straight-run stairs, parallel to the facade,  
provide access to the floors; the apart-  
ments can be reached by walkways and are  
thus separated from events on the gallery.  
The entrance doors, turned slightly inward,  
allow for visual contact into the access  
area through the kitchen windows situ-  
ated at the corner. The organization of the  
apartment is essentially the same despite  
varying apartment sizes\: located along  
a slanted hallway are, first, the kitchen,  
then the wedge-shaped living area. In  
the hallway, a diagonally inserted yellow  
cube \(storage room\) separates the living  
and sleeping areas and directs circulation  
toward the living room. A second door  
behind the cube provides a direct short  
connection between living and sleeping  
areas \(second path\). Upon entering the  
apartment, a visitor can see through it  
all the way to the loggia; floor-to-ceiling  
sliding windows admit light and open the  
room up to the outside. On the second  
floor the apartments are organized around  
inserted interior courtyards. These interior  
courtyards and the rooftop terraces on the  
third floor are marked on the courtyard  
side as recesses in the built volume. The  
crosswall/lightweight structure enables  
changes after the fact\: only one column,  
one wall, and the installation shaft are  
fixed inside an apartment.

The five-story apartment building along the  
road has a supporting structure composed  
of crosswalls and columns, which provides a  
division for the dwellings. According to their  
size they take up one, two, or three sec-  
tions, whereby one section corresponds to  
the width of a room. Studios and lofts are  
available as variations on the apartments.  
Each stairwell has a lift and a generously  
proportioned entrance area \(with a commu-  
nal room!\), and leads to two dwelling units  
per story. As a rule, a 3½- and 4½-room flat  
are located next to each other, each taking  
up 2 or 3 sections respectively. The former  
makes use of the width of the stairwell as  
an “additional” room. The design also allows  
freedom of choice within each flat. Walls  
can be placed in any of a number of predetermined  
locations\: at the expense of the  
living room, for example, the kitchen can  
be extended to become a dwelling kitchen,  
and the walls separating the bedrooms can  
be placed in a space-defining manner. But  
the uniform kitchen/bathroom unit next  
to the entrance complete with bath, WC,  
and réduit remains fixed. All rooms can be  
reached directly from the large corridor.  
The bedrooms face the courtyard, the main  
rooms the road. Apart from the kitchen, all  
rooms have access to balconies – even the  
bathroom. This makes the flat seem very  
open. On the ground floor commercial use  
units alternate with 3-room apartments  
with private front gardens facing the street.  
A roofed area for locking up bicycles shields  
the back of the communal garden from  
the paved inner yard. The communal roof  
terrace affords a magnificent view of nearby  
Alsace.

The plan closes the corner lot with a row,  
and the circumferential balconies mark  
the end of the street. The building is con-  
nected to the shallower neighbouring  
house in the street by a narrow structure  
with terraces \(running all the way from the  
street through to the courtyard\). The apart-  
ment floor plans are wrapped around two  
stairwells so that all apartments can claim  
two orientations or views \(street/courtyard  
or street/corner or courtyard/corner\). The  
stairwells are coiled around a lightwell  
that runs from top to bottom through the  
building; they begin in the raised ground  
floor with a large entry hall, almost one and  
a half stories high, and open out onto long  
landings on the floors. Almost every apart-  
ment has a special feature\: corner living  
rooms with windows on two sides \(at the  
end of the row\); clear separation of living  
and sleeping according to two points of  
the compass \(central apartments\); terraces  
extending from front to back of building  
\(apartments connected to the neigh-  
bouring house\); circumferential rooftop  
terraces \(apartments on sixth floor\); etc.  
All windows are from floor to ceiling; the  
circumferential balconies are 60 cm wide  
on the street side \(exception\: in front of  
corner apartment\) and 1.75 m wide on the  
courtyard side.

85 Piraeus | Kollhoff | 1994  
This sculptural superblock was based  
on an urban plan by Jo Coenen, whose  
master plan had envisioned a more con-  
ventional block-edge development at this  
site. However, the existing building on the  
water’s edge, which was to be preserved,  
acted as a catalyst for the metamorphosis  
of this fundamental urban type. The block  
edge skirts around the old building, it is  
angled in plan and section, thus establish-  
ing a distinctive urban volume. The build-  
ing opens and turns toward the surround-  
ings in a wide variety of ways, resulting in  
brightly lit rooms, improved views of the  
city and the water, and rooms that are up  
to 8 m high in the attic story. From the  
ground to the 4th floor the internal organi-  
zation of the building is almost exclusively  
realized with double-loaded stairwells.  
Covered walkways, serviced by only two  
lifts, complement the provisions for ac-  
cess; they alternate on the various levels  
between courtyard elevation and street/  
waterside elevation and also articulate the  
image of the facades. There are 143 floor-  
plan options for the 304 apartments, in  
part due to the complex shape of the plan.  
However, despite the multitude of plans,  
the apartments are invariably divided by  
the same core consisting of hallway, WC,  
bathroom, storage room, shaft, and linear  
kitchen. This core always results in a circu-  
lar internal path with the bedrooms facing  
in one direction and the living area with  
loggia or balcony facing in the other.

# Spühler | 1995  
Construction on a long triangular plot at  
the waterside. Two narrow linear blocks  
run lengthways. Lateral buildings between  
these blocks create interior courtyards,  
which grow shorter toward the end of  
the complex and are open to the south.  
Towards the river the facades are smooth  
and 5 stories high; towards the residential  
road they are 3 and 4 stories high. There  
is an administration building at the base  
of the triangle. The ground floor contains  
shops, offices, and community services  
\(kindergarten, crib and crèche\). Each of the  
stairwells in the long rows \(with individual  
elevator\) provides access to just two apart-  
ments per landing. On the standard floor  
the apartment door leads, surprisingly, first  
to the large loggia, which is simultaneously  
an entrance and an open space, and  
serves as a buffer zone. The living space  
is adjacent. The apartments bend sharply  
around the interior courtyard, with their  
main rooms \(living room, kitchen, dining  
area\) facing the road, and the bedrooms  
facing the yard. The bend is the central  
point between the entrance, living room,  
and private sleeping corridor. The auxiliary  
rooms lie along the seam where the apart-  
ments connect, acting as a service spine  
serving both sides. The shape of the plot  
has endowed the lateral buildings with a  
variety of length, and thus also the apart-  
ments. The longer the building, the more  
rooms there are along the corridor. In part  
the apartments interlock at their \(wide\)  
ends. As a result there is a whole range of  
apartment sizes. The longest side building  
contains four large apartments serving as  
communal flats.

89 Hollainhof  
# Neutelings Riedijk | 1999  
The “Hollainhof” subsidized housing  
project is located in the center of Ghent  
between the street and the riverside  
promenade. An interior courtyard has  
been created by concentrating the  
development along the edges of the  
lot. This open space provides tranquil-  
ity and seclusion for the complex. The  
verdant courtyard offers access to most  
apartments, with the exception of a few  
ground-floor units facing the street.  
The rows consist of 5 and 9 individual  
cubes, respectively, which are linked  
via access elements or auxiliary rooms.  
Each cube is based on a square grid of  
4  
×  
4 units. Each unit, in turn, can be  
occupied by a room or a terrace area.  
Living rooms generally extend across  
two side-by-side or sequential units.  
The various combinations of these  
building blocks result in a wide variety  
of apartment types, which are suitable  
for differing tenant groups. By joining  
different apartment types, each house  
is given a unique shape and the entire  
row presents an animated silhouette.  
The street elevation, alone, presents  
a cohesive image provided by a long  
wall panel with vertical slits. It acts as a  
visual and acoustic shield between the  
street and the covered walkways. These  
decks and their small front gardens  
create a buffer zone for the flats and  
maisonettes on the second and third  
floors. On the riverside elevation, the  
cubes are composed of row houses  
with private gardens and the complex  
configuration of flats and maisonettes  
above, which are accessed via exterior  
stairs.

# Aranguren & Gallegos | 2003  
Two requirements define the social hous-  
ing project in Carabanchel\: rationalization  
of the elements with a view to keeping  
construction costs low, and the need for a  
high degree of flexibility. The development  
consists of blocks that are lined up in se-  
quence. Each block arrangement occupies  
an entire city block and creates a large, pri-  
vate inner courtyard. The standardization  
of the building elements and the rational  
layout of the floor plans are applied to  
both the exterior and the interior.  
All residential units are organized in the  
same manner\: kitchens and sanitary blocks,  
located at the center partition wall between  
units, create a fixed, raised core, while the  
remaining space of the apartment is ar-  
ranged along the facade and interpreted as  
a flexible space. Various elements – sliding  
walls, built-in cabinets, and niches for bed  
storage recessed into the floor in the cor-  
ridor – make it possible to transform this  
open space which is bathed in natural light.  
The raised dining area expands this field,  
adds space to the living room and serves as  
an interface with the other areas. A subtle  
transition of four steps between corridor,  
kitchen, baths, and rooms separates the  
fixed from the flexible spaces. It also sup-  
ports the idea of habitation as an activity  
on the part of the residents\: that is, room  
configurations that differ depending on use  
and time of day.

The building is sited along the full length  
of a triangular, inner city block, defining  
the corners of the block with its distinc-  
tive curves. The standard floor plan of the  
apartments is defined by an open-plan  
area that runs on a diagonal from front to  
back\: from the south-facing balcony on the  
courtyard side to the bays on the street  
side. Although the living area is only 2 m  
wide, it opens diagonally into the kitchen  
and the living room, respectively. On the  
other sides, the two individual rooms  
are linked along the facades with sliding  
doors, making it possible to experience the  
full width of the apartment when these  
are opened. The floor-plan pattern that  
emerges – also by means of the seamless  
integration of built-in cabinets and kitchen  
counters, the placement of the bathroom  
behind the access core, and the option of  
partitioning the large living area – creates  
an ambiguous, open space with natural  
zones for access, eating, cooking, and  
living. Due to the alternating crosswise  
arrangement of the floor plans from one  
level to the next, the bays also appear in an  
alternating fashion on the exterior, creat-  
ing a dynamic external expression that re-  
flects the diagonals in the internal layout,  
thus informing the sculptural character of  
the entire building.

# Office Winhov | 2010  
In a post-war development on the outskirts  
of Amsterdam, two linear slab blocks form  
the east and west edges of an urban block  
ensemble framing a raised plaza above  
a parking garage in between, on which a  
mosque, a solitary residential building, and  
a school are located. This plaza opens to  
the north towards a public park and the  
sporting facility of a school via a generous  
stairway. The distinctively articulated plinth  
of the eastern block edge building medi-  
ates between the different levels of the  
street and the raised courtyard. It houses  
spacious entrance halls open to both sides,  
which lead to the half-sunken gymnasium  
and the apartments above. At the building  
ends, individual entrances to the duplex  
units \(Types a and c\) lead directly to the  
street, their transparent facades also  
enabling their usage as commercial spaces.  
The floor plans of some of the flats  
\(Type d\) follow a simple but effective  
principle of division into three sections.  
The mid-section – a row of storage spaces,  
built-in furniture, inserted cores with  
bathrooms and WCs, and circulation areas  
– is offset to the sequences of rooms along  
both facades in such a way as to allow  
numerous crosslinks\: from the living room  
to the dining space through the kitchen,  
from the entrance hall to the three rooms  
through a corridor or – in some apart-  
ments – from room to room through a  
shared closet. A certain degree of flexibility  
is maintained. For instance, the rooms can  
Staalmanplein be combined by removing the non-struc-  
tural dividing wall between the living room  
and bedroom facing the courtyard. And as  
the dining area has its own access point,  
it can be separated from the kitchen and  
used for other purposes. The principle of  
multiple links on both sides of an inserted  
core is also implemented in the 2-room  
apartment \(Type b\).

# Esch Sintzel | 2013  
Intent on orienting as many apartments as  
possible in both directions – both toward  
the bright and lively but also loud street as  
well as the quiet, green courtyard – a block  
edge building is connected to five side  
wings. In the T-shaped segments, where  
the front building transitions into the  
tapered, dually oriented side wings, differ-  
ent apartment types emerge from layered  
sequences of rooms. Strings of connected  
and side-by-side spaces run from the  
front to the back of the apartment. They  
are at times passages from one room to  
another, at other times enclosed spaces  
and open up toward either the street or  
the courtyard.  
In the single-story units \(Type a and  
b\) a room-sized loggia, eat-in kitchen,  
and bathroom are lined up along the  
street facade. Following in the layer  
behind on the courtyard side is a large  
living room and one or two bedrooms. At  
the juncture of the front building and the  
side wing, a second bedroom oriented  
toward the side courtyard, a bathroom,  
and an open hallway are lined up with  
the apartment entrance.  
This spatial system is similarly applied  
in the front section of the duplex units  
\(Types c and d\). Instead of a hallway, how-  
ever, a staircase descends or ascends into  
the side wing, where a further living room  
leads to an entrance area, from which an  
additional room and bathroom branch off.  
This spatial arrangement in the back  
area is again repeated in the smaller single-  
story units \(Type e\). In the front building,  
a narrow connecting hallway, analogous  
to the duplex staircase, leads into an open  
eat-in kitchen followed by a loggia.  
Complementing these similarly laid-out  
and cleverly interlaced units oriented in  
all directions are the apartments \(Type f\)  
at the rear, which look out on three sides  
toward the courtyard. Here the living room  
is a meandering circulation space at times  
looking out onto one courtyard or together  
with the kitchen toward another.

The buildings are part of a larger conver-  
sion scheme for a former rail yard on the  
edge of a new park, which is intended to  
contribute to urban densification. The  
conceptual and aesthetic inspiration for  
the residential development was industrial  
buildings, whose structural and robust  
nature offers spatial possibilities for both  
living and work configurations that can be  
interpreted individually and rearranged by  
the user.  
In building 3, the units are arranged  
around a room-sized central hallway in  
such a way that almost every other field  
within the spatial grid of the apartment is  
directly accessible. However, the flexibility  
in use for each room stems not only from  
1½-height spaces along the facade form  
particular focal points for the apartment.  
The loft-like apartments in building 2  
this spatial configuration\: by implementing  
a concrete skeletal structure, almost all the  
vertical planes can be filled in or changed  
at will – either as dividing walls or built-in  
furniture. The level of material transpar-  
ency between adjacent rooms is similarly  
open to interpretation. In addition, the  
nal staircase. The placement of two interior  
mechanical cores divides the apartments  
into three parallel zones, providing a sense  
of how the floor plan could be organized  
without specifically defining the use of  
each space. For example, the hallway could  
be placed in the middle with enclosed  
functional zones at either end in order to  
are each laid out over an entire floor and  
are directly accessed by elevator or exter-  
leave the rooms along the facade as open  
as possible. Or more cores could be insert-  
ed on the apartment perimeter to create  
differently sized zones, while still ensuring  
free circulation within the apartment.

# URBAN INFILL  
# The building scale and complexity of fl oor plans of  
# these developments can vary greatly. Urban infi ll is a  
# building task with numerous stipulations and requires  
# an intense examination into the built environment  
# and its characteristics. Yet precisely these narrow  
# specifi cations sometimes inspire experimental fl oor  
# plan solutions.  
# While in Europe, the context for this building type  
# is dominated by the closed urban block, so that urban  
# infi ll projects are for the most part bordered by two  
# fi rewalls, they can also be set apart from one another  
# in more open blocks, either along the street or in the  
# block’s interior.  
# Approaches to the building task can vary greatly  
# and are often radical in nature\: examples include  
# complete coverage of the infi ll lot combined with an  
# atrium; offsetting the infi ll volume on one side and  
# thus creating an opening to the courtyard; complete  
# isolation of the volume from all surrounding fi rewalls;  
# or dissolving the new development into many small  
# volumes, which seamlessly adapt to the existing  
# confi guration and every possible gap within it. Corner  
# buildings, on the other hand – having the advantage  
# of two street-facing facades and an increased urban  
# presence – assume a more prominent place in the ur-  
# ban plan. The disadvantage of a poorly lit inner corner,  
# however, demands specifi c solutions – such as the  
# placement of the access core at this point.  
# Given their manageable scale, urban infi ll projects  
# create opportunities for innovation not only in fl oor  
# plan design but also in construction, energy concepts,  
# or fi nancing methods. Thus, many urban dwellers  
# discover the idea of a joint building venture\: they as-  
# sume the role of property developer with the advan-  
# tage of being able to participate in the design of the  
# building and their own apartment from the ground up  
# as future tenants.

Maximum-utilization urban infill in the  
historical old town of Seville. Not only was  
the block perimeter closed here, but the  
500 m², irregular lot was completely built  
over. Only one patio, whose basic area  
had to amount to 25 percent of the property  
area, was left free. The built volume,  
which bran­ ches out on three sides with the  
kidney-shaped patio in the center, made  
it impos­ sible to give the three apartments  
equal value\: they had to be adapted. One  
of the four-room apartments has a living  
room that serves as hallway and dining  
area; the bedrooms are located along  
twisted corri­ dors. Two of the bed­ rooms  
and the kitchen are opened up to the  
neighbouring courtyard through a lightwell.  
One apartment is organized along a long  
hallway around the patio. Accessible to all  
residents\: the roof terrace. The patio can  
be covered with a cotton ­ tarpaulin.

Open-plan approach to urban infill. The  
shallowness of the building and the gener-  
ous use of glass \(glass facade to court­ yard,  
corner windows, glass stairwell to street\)  
are designed to channel as much light as  
possible into and through the building  
while illuminating the street and block  
interior at the same time. The glazed  
stairwell, in which the staircase lies paral-  
lel to the facade, dramatizes the coming  
and going of residents. The roughly square  
floor plans are arranged around a compact  
core – with bath, WC, forecourt, kitchen  
row; they can be divided by sliding walls  
or used as freely flowing space. The slid-  
ing walls disappear entirely into their wall  
pockets.

A corner building with wings of different  
lengths, which makes the corner visible  
by means of a wide through passage to  
the block interior \(via steps that first lead  
up and then down into the courtyard\).  
The corner symmetry is emphasized by  
the U-shaped heads of the wings and  
through the connected oriels. The kitchens  
feature a band of windows around the  
corner, providing a view into both streets.  
Symmetry is key – in terms of access and  
internal layout\: the living room extends  
from the street to the courtyard \(room  
depth roughly 8 m plus balcony\) and can  
be divided by sliding wall panels or double  
doors. The bedrooms are reached along a  
separate hallway from the living room.

Two individual buildings can be distin-  
guished. The floor plans of the buildings  
are based on a symmetrical scheme. The  
center of the corner building contains a  
formally defined stairwell placed on the  
bisecting line; the two- and three-room  
apartments are grouped around the  
stairwell, again symmetrically. The tiny  
entryway leads directly into the large living  
room, which extends from the street to the  
courtyard in the large apartments; in the  
case of the smaller units, the living room  
stretches parallel to the street. Both liv-  
ing rooms are developed symmetrically to  
the entrance; they function as center and  
distributor for the apartment. In the adja-  
cent house, a corridor continuing around  
the corners connects nearly all rooms. The  
living area, which is once again octagonal,  
leads to the winter garden and bedroom.

107 Admiralstraße | Nylund,  
# Puttfarken, Stürzebecher | 1986  
One goal of the 7-story “housing shelf,”  
which was realized as part of an interna-  
tional building expo in the 1980s, was to  
stem the exodus toward home ownership  
on the periphery and the resulting urban  
sprawl, and to encourage residents to re-  
main in their urban quarter. Collaborative  
planning, building, and living were part  
of the program for the cooperative. The  
primary structure of the house consists of  
a framework of prefabricated reinforced  
concrete components\: when the shell was  
completed, it had the appearance of a  
shelf with \(open\) compartments – hence  
the nickname. The future residents then  
“inserted” the 2-story apartments into  
this framework. Realized in wooden skel-  
eton construction and built in part by the  
residents themselves, the idea originated  
in the concept of creating stacked row-  
houses right in the city. The individual  
floor plans were determined by the users  
themselves in consultation with the archi-  
tect. While the room divisions are entirely  
different in the twelve units, the floor plan  
concepts remain conventional\: either with  
a front-to-back open living room or with  
a kitchen separated from the living room  
and bedrooms on the upper level. In some  
units, the bathtub is accessible from two  
sides. All units have the benefit of gener-  
ous winter gardens or loggias and small  
balconies as well. The planted roof patio  
is for shared use by all residents. Any  
decisions with regard to modifications to  
the building are made jointly by the  
cooperative.

A display of different kinds of cir-  
culation\: The lower building section  
– originally a garage with a turning  
loop for the buses of the Allied  
Forces at the former Checkpoint  
Charlie – occupies the entire lot and  
forms a plateau on which the six-  
story apartment building is erected.  
Levels 1 and 2 are occupied by  
maisonettes with the luxury of pri-  
vate front gardens that are directly  
accessible from the plateau. Both  
interior and exterior stairs lead  
to the upper level. The four upper  
apartment floors are accessible  
via galleries, two of which as part  
of a two-story gallery clad in glass  
louvers, and another gallery that is  
open beneath a cantilevered roof  
projecting far into the urban space.  
The simple apartments along the  
galleries utilize and emphasize the  
east-west orientation\: front-to-back  
east-west living rooms with galley  
kitchens or kitchens facing east, liv-  
ing rooms with a loggia or balcony  
facing west. The lower gallery also  
provides access to the apartments  
on level 3 via stairs inside the  
apartments. They are comparable  
to the other apartments; however,  
a wall parallel to the stairs sepa-  
rates a corridor, which connects the  
bedrooms, bathroom, and a storage  
room and loops around to connect  
with the living room. The penthouse  
apartments feature one extra study  
or bedroom overlooking the short  
gallery and have the added benefit  
of a roof terrace.

The building site is narrowed by the two  
adjacent buildings that reach deep into  
the courtyard. The new building is set  
independently into the courtyard; its sides  
are concave to make the gap seem larger.  
This unusual structure was made possible  
by an exception in the building code \(for  
architectural ensembles\). The apartments  
on the third and fourth stories, above  
store and offices, each occupy one half of  
the longitudinally divided building. The  
living rooms open up to the east, to the  
street; bedrooms face the courtyard to the  
west. The open kitchens in the center of  
the apartments are lit through glass-brick  
walls. The rooms are connected by a mini-  
mal hallway along the curved outer wall.  
Each of the fourth-floor apartments has a  
rooftop terrace.

The deep and narrow building form is  
a result of the medieval lot. An elevator  
provides direct access to the apartments,  
while an open staircase at the end of the  
lot also serves as a loggia on each level.  
The apartments are divided by the eleva-  
tor shaft and the sanitary block. On the  
street side, the bedrooms lie behind a  
fully glazed facade covered by a moveable  
curtain of perforated latticework. The living  
room and kitchen to the rear of the build-  
ing are grouped around a central light well  
that opens onto the adjacent southeastern  
lot and is horizontally stepped back on  
each floor. The 6th and 7th floors accom-  
modate a maisonette\: living area below  
\(kitchen integrated into core, flexible use  
of all rooms\), bedrooms above \(large con-  
necting ensuite bathroom\). Narrow patios  
overlooking the street and the courtyard.

115 Rue de l’Ourcq | Gazeau | 1993  
The design of this infill construction – which  
opens up more than it closes – was inspired by its  
dense, heterogeneous surroundings. A slit divides  
the block into two volumes \(3.5 m/7.5 m\) both  
of which stand tall toward the street and short  
in the back. In this way sunlight and the life of  
the street reach the block’s interior; apartments  
can orient themselves to more than two sides.  
A generous stairwell spans the gap between the  
two building halves, connecting them together.  
The open stairs have giant wooden platforms  
that reach into the block‘s interior, and are at  
once terraces and meeting places for the resi-  
dents. The first two floors to the rear hold larger  
apartments distributed over several levels. Along  
the street front, modest studios and 2-room  
units are stacked up to the eighth floor on top  
of the ground floor shops. The apartments  
generally open onto a corridor that leads to a  
bedroom and bath on one side, and living room,  
kitchen, and toilet on the other.

# Léon, Wohlhage | 1993  
The structure with slanted glazing on the  
courtyard side and a punctuated masonry  
wall on the street elevation is conceived as  
a freestanding corner building. For a social  
housing development, the standards are  
of extraordinarily high quality, made pos-  
sible by a compensatory model\: in return  
for increased utilization of the lot, the client  
financed conservatories, ecologically sustain-  
able exterior walls, and interior sliding walls.  
Parallel to the longitudinal side, the plan is  
divided into static zones\: living areas, sanitary  
areas, and central corridor. The zones are  
stepped back. Two apartments per floor are  
furnished with two conservatories each. The  
other three apartments are oriented toward  
the street and open onto a shared balcony. In  
these units the rooms are kept functionally  
neutral and are arranged side-by-side; sliding  
walls make it possible to combine two rooms  
into one. The two-bedroom apartments with  
kitchen block can be opened up into one  
single open-plan space.

117 Space Block Kamishinjo |  
# Kojima + Akamatsu | 1998  
The building closes a small building gap  
that runs crosswise through an urban  
block. This situation permits neither front  
nor rear buildings, and no courtyard space  
for natural light; instead, a dense, homo-  
geneous spatial structure composed of  
“space blocks” runs from one end through  
to the far end. Basic Space Blocks is a  
system of modular space blocks with an  
edge length of 2.4 m, which are placed  
front-to-back, side-by-side or on top of  
one another, thereby creating complex,  
three-dimensional, stacked housing con-  
figurations. Natural light and views are  
provided for the apartment interiors by  
manipulating this spatial construct. This  
results in mini­ apartments, which offer sur-  
prising spatial qualities in a continuum of  
three-dimensional situations despite their  
limited floor area\: some are single-level  
but with two-story atria in one segment,  
which allows light to fall into the apart-  
ment from the other side. At other times,  
stairs set into similar atria provide access  
to generous roof patios, or else a unit is  
oriented in the opposite direction on the  
second level and connected on that side to  
another space module. Some modules are  
cantilevered, simply to open the view into  
the street perspective. The building was  
the first in a series of similar projects in  
urban contexts with extreme density. The  
“porosity factor” – which measures the per-  
meability of the space blocks to light and  
air – emerged as the conceptual leitmotif  
for the design method.

A small, very narrow building gap fronted by  
a square and with a garden to the rear. In  
response to the site, the building is divided  
lengthwise; the two identical halves are set  
off from one another in plan and section to  
leave the block edge open and to allow light  
into the units. Interior and exterior are inter-  
twined. The space between the party walls  
remains perceptible. The apartments are  
oriented both toward the square and to the  
street. Floor-to-ceiling glazing in the facades  
extends part of the living space in a visual  
fashion across the entire width of the gap,  
the other section – raised by 40 cm – medi-  
ates between interior and exterior and forms  
a “pano­ ramic window.” The private area of  
the apartment is divided into hallway, bath-  
room, and bedroom by a built-in unit with  
sliding doors.

# Höhne & Rapp | 2000  
The house is located in Borneo-Eiland, a  
new urban development area in Amster­ dam,  
whose parcels were sold to private individu-  
als and their architects with the proviso of  
adhering to the row house typology. This  
home divides a “quasi public“ passage way,  
which links the road and the waterway. The  
entrance is located in this passage way, with  
a work area occupying the other side. Both  
halves of the building are united on the  
second floor \(open living zone\). On the third  
floor, how­ ever, an elongated terrace – which  
echoes the passage below – serves as a  
dividing element be­ tween bedrooms \(master  
bedroom, children’s bed­ room\[s\]\). The middle  
of the house is occu­ pied on one side by the  
service rooms, to the left by a spiraling stair-  
case, and to the right by the sanitary rooms.  
Qualitatively, this design is remark­ able for  
the idea of drawing the exterior space cross-  
wise through the house, with all the advan-  
tages \(e.g., lighting\) and disadvantages \(e.g.,  
narrow rooms\) this entails.

# Atelier Bow-Wow | 2005  
The sculptural shape of the minihouse  
evolved out of the interplay of several pa-  
rameters, such as the maximum allowable  
building volume, rules regarding distance,  
fire, and earthquake safety regulations, the  
mandate that only a part of the sky may  
be obstructed from the street perspec-  
tive, as well as the hybrid program for the  
interior. The work/live building consists  
of open levels, progressing from floor to  
floor in the manner of a split-level and  
terminating in the roof patio. The result is  
a spatial continuum, where working \(base-  
ment and mezzanine\) and living \(upper  
floors\) transition into one another without  
clear spatial separation; with the excep-  
tion of the bathrooms and WCs, there are  
no room enclosures. Intimacy is indicated  
by subtle means\: for example, the heating  
element which reaches through the full  
height of the building, permits or blocks  
visual sightlines, the functional definition  
of the mezzanine hints at the use assigned  
to the following floor, the translucent wall  
elements slow down sight and movement  
alike. To one side of the entrance, the  
upper floor of the living area is clad in the  
same wood elements as the suspended  
ceilings. The small windows in the internal  
facade seem like an ironic nod to con-  
ventional living. Despite the immediate  
proximity, subtly formulated boundaries  
and the staggered levels promote a sense  
of spatial separation between the differ-  
ent areas. This corresponds with the users’  
wish for a house in which the transition  
from public to private space is fluid and  
not abrupt in nature.

The project was realized by a housing co-  
operative with the future residents assum-  
ing the role of client. This allowed them to  
influence the building costs, implement  
individual floor plan preferences, and form  
a cooperative community of residents even  
prior to completion. The group chose a  
construction method that is amenable to  
flexible floor plan design while also being  
ecologically and economically sustainable\:  
a seven-story post-and-beam wood con-  
struction with reinforcing solid wood walls  
and composite wood-concrete ceilings that  
freely span the space with a central girder  
that is flush with the ceiling; the only  
elements in the interior space of the room  
are two installation shafts. Completely  
different floor plans with open living areas  
were developed in consultation with the  
users. While some of the living areas are  
fully open from front to rear and others  
are oriented towards the courtyard or the  
access, all are wrapped around the indi-  
vidual rooms located at the corners or the  
courtyard i.e. street elevation.  
The access core is separate for reasons  
of fire protection\: since the apartment  
building is a wood construction, the es-  
cape route had to be built in reinforced  
concrete and set apart from the building.  
The resulting gap creates a “third facade”.  
Transferring the stairwell to the outside  
also helps to facilitate flexibility in the in-  
terior and shifts access to each apartment,  
via 3-m-long footbridges, into the urban  
space. On three floors, the access route  
leads across a generously proportioned  
incised open space, further enhancing the  
feeling of owning an entire level and hence  
a home of one’s own in the city.

The hybrid building is conceived as an  
interface for a variety of different uses.  
Ground floor and basement with an in-  
serted light well accommodate retail and  
event areas. The 2nd and 3rd floors above  
contain two-story work/live studios. The  
mixed-use housing in this “urban plinth” is  
aimed at promoting the formation of local  
structures, social integration and coopera-  
tion within and outside of the building.  
From the 4th floor onward, the building  
is distinguished by a highly differentiated  
spatial structure, creating flexible units  
with the character of a very unique “house  
within a house.”  
The varying floor heights – on both the  
courtyard and the street elevation – as well  
as the cascading offset levels parallel to the  
facades, create complex unit types with up  
to four different levels.  
The internal room sequences border  
onto the stairwell – either on two or on  
three sides – and simultaneously connect  
with different floor and mezzanine land-  
ings, making it possible to subdivide the  
units. The separable units can be rented  
out, utilized for multigenerational living or  
as home offices, and also serve as small  
flats for caregivers or in-house help.  
On the narrow, south-facing courtyard  
side, ceilings soar up to 4.3 m\: above the  
kitchens, the space on this side of the  
building includes a gallery for use as a  
library or an additional open space. A guest  
apartment is available in the attic story,  
while the roof patio serves as a common  
outdoor space.

The project reacts to a growing trend  
in Japan in which singles decide to live  
together without knowing one another  
beforehand. The building is structured in  
a manner to help the residents overcome  
initial shyness, fostering both interac-  
tion and exchange in variable intensities,  
while also providing each resident with a  
more private spatial sphere in which to  
withdraw. The large dining table, for in-  
stance, encourages contact between many  
residents. Various niches are more suitable  
for spending time alone or in small groups.  
Private and shared spaces interlock to  
form a three-dimensional system with  
offset levels, subtly situated staircases,  
and numerous visual connections flanked  
by private rooms. Wall segments in the  
private rooms, placed perpendicularly  
behind the door, form an intermediate  
space and visual buffer to ensure that the  
interior of these rooms cannot be directly  
seen from the shared areas. All residents  
share a bathroom centrally located on the  
ground floor.

This project proposes a new building type  
in recognition of the criticism that micro-  
apartments are often only temporary in  
nature and lacking in social potential.  
The spatial finiteness of the units – each  
outfitted with foldable furniture and  
built-in storage spaces – is compen-  
sated by open access spaces running  
between them. To a certain degree, this  
softens the divisions between private and  
public, transforming them into a social  
fabric stretched between the residents.  
Simultaneously, the spatial system allows  
the combination of individual units across  
the interstitial spaces. This flexibility is  
intended to enable the residents to live  
much longer in the building regardless of  
changing personal conditions. The lower  
levels form an interface\: the open space  
at street level can also be used by visitors.  
A micro-auditorium extends this space  
downward and leads to a café and gallery.  
The units on the 2nd floor can also be eas-  
ily converted into work or gallery spaces.

129 SL Court | Field Design | 2014  
Occupying the corner of an open block  
edge development, the building consists  
of two parallel rows framing a shared  
courtyard. In the street side row, residen-  
tial units for families extend through the  
entire height of the building, while two  
much smaller apartments for singles or  
couples are stacked on top of one another  
on the other side. The building’s section  
reveals its unique spatial organization\:  
both rows are divided along their entire  
lengths and organized as split-levels.  
Within the same height as a conventional  
two-story building, up to seven different  
intermediate levels are arranged – each  
with very different ceiling heights from 1  
to 4½ m and with floor areas between 4½  
and 25 m², cut to size for various activities  
and uses. The implementation of offset  
levels instead of dividing walls provides  
a feeling of protective distance. Only the  
bedrooms in the middle are given ad-  
ditional translucent sliding elements. One  
single space flows openly throughout the  
units without completely dissolving the  
borders of the individual areas, enabling  
dense living in close proximity.  
Type c is laid out over four levels for  
a family with one child. It begins with an  
extremely compactly arranged living area,  
whose different ceiling heights subtly  
zone the space. Located on the level  
above is a small bridge-like workspace  
with view below into the living room as  
well as to the child’s room a half-story  
above. At the top, another level provides  
space for the parent’s bed, which lies  
at almost the exact height of the child’s  
bunk. The ceiling here is so low that  
the small roof patio/loggia can only be  
reached by crawling out over the bed.

# FIREWALL BUILDING  
# Building lots between fi rewalls are often the result  
# of wounds and breaks within the historic pattern of  
# a city; they are not intended as part of an ideal urban  
# plan. Firewalls are created, for example, when new  
# traffi c arteries create residual plots. In this case, the  
# expectation of their development is to mediate aes-  
# thetically between enclosed city blocks and the open  
# modern city. Firewall developments always have the  
# opportunity to make a virtue out of necessity and to  
# turn the disadvantage of the necessarily one-sided  
# orientation into developing a unique housing type\: the  
# structure can take on an additional dimension through  
# folds and undulations in the facade or by dissolving  
# the whole into individual sections, offering variety in  
# views and lighting possibilities. Special attention in the  
# design can be given to the interface between fi rewall  
# and new development\: thus the new building can be  
# set apart providing the building sections adjacent to  
# the fi rewall with more air and light.  
1.3 1.3 I. S. M. House | Coderch | 1951  
The residential building for the families of fisher-  
men forms the head of a row in the harbor dis-  
trict. The geometry of the ground plan with its two  
mirror-image apartments is as animated as the  
undulating facade. The corridor leads in a sweep-  
ing diagonal across the apartment and straight  
ahead into the living room to a corner which is  
dissolved into window elements allowing the  
space to be flooded in light and offering a view  
onto the street space. A passage at a right angle in  
front of the living room leads to the kitchen with  
terrace. The bedroom wing with ensuite bath is  
located on the other side of the main corridor; the  
bedrooms are reached via a separate corridor and  
are connected on the exterior by loggias, which  
are protected from the elements with louvered  
shutters. The movable louvers, which allow the  
occupants to regulate the ingress of light, further  
animate the facade. The modest apartment size  
is amply compensated by the optimized use of  
all rooms, for which the furnishings were custom  
designed with great attention to detail.

This building along a firewall makes use  
of organic forms. All apartments open up  
toward the garden courtyard; the entrance  
zones with elevators and stairwells are  
placed against the end wall. The division of  
the apartments does away with hallways  
and lobbies, the soft outlines and height  
differences of the floor plans create zones  
that can and must be interpreted by the  
resident. 2-room apartments\: the kitchen  
\(as counter/bar\) is lit and ventilated indi-  
rectly via the living room. The rounded area  
adjacent to the kitchen can be used as a  
cloakroom. The separation or connection  
of sleeping and living areas is possible.  
4-room apartments\: the kitchen is part  
of the large living room/throughway \(the  
traditional “Berlin room”\). From there, on  
the second and third floors direct access to  
the garden is provided via spiral staircases.  
6-room maisonettes of exceptional size on  
the basement story/ground floor and on  
the 5th and 6th floors\: A spiral staircase  
connects the two levels, steps and galleries  
structure the space. They have direct access

135 Köpenicker Straße |  
# Steidle | 1985  
The project consists of three different  
structures\: the conversion of the existing  
transverse wing, the four-story row along  
the firewall \(documented here\), and a  
building on Köpenicker Straße. The new  
row is set off from the firewall roughly by  
the depth of the building; the intermediate  
space was transformed into a glassed-in  
access hall with ramps in the length of the  
building. The plan of the building, legible  
as a meandering pattern, is comprised of  
two-apartment modules \(apartments are  
divided by diagonal walls\); the glass surfaces  
in front of the sleeping and living  
areas form another meandering pattern  
in plan, developed around the facade  
recesses. The apartments are accessed via  
a short entry hallway; kitchen and small  
bedroom \(with bed niche\) can be entered  
from the living room. In the apartments  
along the access hall, the kitchens and  
baths are lit and ventilated via the hall; the  
outside-oriented apartments have baths  
located at the core, but kitchens with large  
windows to the park.

A firewall construction on a narrow  
\(4-m-wide\) street. The building’s mass  
was broken down into three individual  
blocks. This was done not so much out of  
the architect’s concern for the apartments’  
qualities, but rather to seize the chance  
to bring light into the shaded Ciutat Vella  
quarter. The boxes of varying heights sit  
atop a shared base which tapers such that  
it pours the life of the main street into the  
side street like a funnel. Shops \(ground  
floor\), entry to the underground garage,  
an office \(second floor\), and two entries  
to the upper stories occupy this shared  
base. From the entry on the ground floor,  
one has two stairwells, each with eleva-  
tor. These split into three on the second  
floor. The apartments are reached by these  
double- and triple-loaded stairwells. The  
units are all compact 3-room apartments  
of similar composition. The living rooms  
are set in the corner and open onto the  
street, underscoring the new – mainly  
visual – relationship established by the  
base beneath. The living rooms give ac-  
cess to the narrow kitchens, while all other  
rooms are reached by a short hall. Each  
of the three blocks is turned and situated  
such that slits of light are created between  
it and the firewall. Some spaces are lit only  
from small loggias. In most cases these  
loggias are attached to the bedroom; while  
others adjoin the kitchen.

# Herzog & de Meuron | 2000  
Densification scheme in a Parisian urban  
block\: a measure that included closing two  
building gaps and several new construc-  
tions at the center of the block. The archi-  
tects reprise several building typologies  
already existing in this urban quarter and  
the charming mix they establish, formulat-  
ing them in a more rigorous vocabulary  
that is entirely their own. On two sides of  
the block, two seven-story buildings fill the  
gaps. Passing beneath these buildings, one  
enters an inner courtyard, which is domi-  
nated by a three-story elongated building  
that is linked to the adjacent buildings  
via low, house-like extensions. Together  
with the elongated slab, the extensions  
surround picturesque gardens to the rear  
for the ground-level apartments. Small,  
two-story houses are nestled against the  
boundary wall on the opposite side, divid-  
ing the elongated courtyard into intimate  
spaces. The most interesting floor plan  
is found in the long building\: all rooms  
are strung in a row on the courtyard side,  
linked by a corridor, which transitions into  
the living room. The same rooms are also  
linked on the exterior by a verandah. Thus,  
each room has two direct links to the out-  
side. These loggias on the courtyard side  
are covered by wooden roller blinds \(remi-  
niscent of a bureau\), which the occupants  
can open and close as needed as protec-  
tion against incident sun or for privacy. The  
small projecting element functions as a  
loggia; on the third floor where large roof  
gardens stretch between the apartments,  
it is reduced to a small balcony. Like the  
long building, the facades of new struc-  
tures closing the gaps are also clad in an  
external facade layer. In this case, the layer  
consists of perforated, individually foldable  
and sliding aluminum sheeting, which is  
also an understated reference to the nar-  
row courtyard entrances.

# Bedaux de Brouwer | 2007  
The development on a triangular lot is an  
addition to a new shopping mall, mediat-  
ing between it and the historic parcel  
development of the old town. The structure  
is based on the grid of the underground  
garage beneath it. Arranged in stacked  
segments and surrounding four patio  
court­ yards in the manner of a comb, the  
structure of the development creates a  
multitude of different apartment types and  
sizes. Despite the increasing building depth,  
the inserted patios ensure that natural light  
flows into all interiors. Each patio offers  
a private interstitial space between the  
building and the city, shared among three  
units. Thanks to the staggered layout, the  
patios also open up a vista in the direction  
of the square to the south. The L-shaped  
apartments are laid out in different plans\:  
as maisonettes around a private courtyard;  
as single-level apartments with individual  
access stairs from the street; or as a row of  
penthouse bungalows reached via a foot-  
bridge from the shopping mall and inserted  
roof terraces. The floor plans reveal that all  
access areas, kitchens, and sanitary blocks  
are situated in the corner without natural  
light, while the living rooms and individual  
rooms all face towards the patio and the  
street across the full width of the space.  
An apartment tower forms the southern  
completion of the complex, creating a new  
visual accent for the urban square. In the  
tower, four maisonette units with light-  
wells along the facade and cantilevered  
two-story loggias on alternating sides are  
stacked one above the other, facing toward  
the cityscape.

s Brick House |  
# Caruso St John | 2005  
The shape of the house evolved  
entirely in response to the unique  
characteristics of the site. Hemmed  
in by a homogeneous Victorian row  
and a heterogeneous rear building,  
the lot is a residual building gap in  
the shape of a triangle. Devoid of  
conventional facades and windows,  
it lies between three fire walls and is  
entirely inward in orientation. With  
its enclosing brick walls, three pa-  
tios, and sculptural roof, the house  
is only ever visible as a fragment  
from the outside, without a defined  
front or rear. Access is through the  
carriageway of the adjacent Victorian  
terrace and via a ramp that leads  
past a patio with exterior stairs  
and directly into the living area,  
which occupies nearly the entire  
upper level. This space is defined  
entirely by form and material; it is  
bounded by stairs leading to the  
private rooms downstairs, the galley  
kitchen, the large patio at the far  
end of the room, and the sculptural,  
reinforced concrete roof, whose  
pronounced three-dimensional  
differences in height and skylights  
create subtle accents in the indi-  
vidual areas. On the lower level, the  
cruciform hall and block-like bath-  
rooms and storage rooms create the  
voids for the private rooms, whose  
walls transition almost seamlessly  
onto the patios thereby extending  
the interior to the exterior. Here, too,  
the consistency in material and the  
dark built-in furniture once again  
serve to emphasize the fluid sculp-  
tural character of the space. The  
same plasticity is found on the three  
patios, which bathe the rooms in  
a soft, muted light.

# BIGyard | zanderroth | 2010  
The inspiration for this cooperative building  
venture was the idea to connect the ideals  
of a single-family home with the advantages  
of living in a dense, urban context. Thus, the  
spatial organization of the individual building  
types and the complex as a whole provides  
numerous neighborly junctures, while also  
ensuring the ability to retreat into more private  
areas. The “townhouses” facing the street \(a\)  
are organized as split-level units and open  
up to their surroundings at multiple points\:  
the entrance and optional commercial spaces  
are connected to the street, the raised eat-in  
kitchen is directly linked to the courtyard, while  
the dual-level roof terraces provide views into  
the surrounding neighborhood. The firewall  
building consists of a row of residential units  
stacked on top of each other. These so-called  
garden houses \(b\) are accessed directly from  
the courtyard, where their eat-in kitchen is  
also located. Situated on the more secluded  
floor above is the living room. The penthouses  
\(c\) above these units are accessed mid-level  
through a corridor to the rear. The living room  
is located on the top floor and has access to a  
private roof terrace above the fray.  
Communal activities foster the feeling  
of a neighborhood\: the garden has not been  
parceled out, thus offering spaces to meet and  
play, and a shared roof terrace with an outdoor  
kitchen can be used by residents in the warmer  
months. There are also a sauna and guest  
apartments.  
The configurations of the block edge and  
the firewall building can be read as a reaction  
to the disadvantages of the lot, which faces  
north and is surrounded by the high walls of  
the neighboring properties. For this reason,  
the townhouses on the street are only 4 stories  
high to allow enough light to reach the garden  
houses. The 3-story garden houses along the  
firewall are built on top of the underground  
garage and therefore raised an entire level.  
Stacked above, the penthouses are exposed  
to natural light from the courtyard as well  
through a patio to the rear.

# Natoma Architects | 2014  
Located on a steeply inclined road, the  
building occupies one complete side of a  
city block along a firewall and marks the  
transition from a freeway to the urban  
block structure of San Francisco. The build-  
ing code requirement of a rear courtyard  
was translated into the final meandering  
figure with its four vertical courtyard voids.  
In section, these spaces are alternatingly  
oriented outward or inward, at once organ-  
izing the building volume and increasing  
the surface area of the facade, and thereby  
the amount of natural light to which each  
apartment is exposed.  
Simultaneously, these well-lit court-  
yards are intended as meeting places for  
residents after walking through the long  
access corridor along the firewall. Most  
apartments are oriented in some way  
toward the courtyard. Some units are ac-  
cessed across bridges in the void spaces,  
while spiral staircases here connect the  
penthouses to private roof terraces.  
The residential units are organized  
around the courtyard on one \(Type i\), two  
\(Type l\), or three sides \(Type U\). In the  
smaller Type i apartments, closet space,  
bathrooms, and kitchen units are organ-  
ized within a “pod,” which divides the  
studio apartment into dining, living, and  
sleeping areas with the aim of creating  
loft-like open floor plans. In the larger Type  
l units, the secondary spaces are bundled  
into a thickened wall running along the  
apartment perimeter and through all living  
spaces, thus complementing each space  
with the necessary service elements, such  
as a kitchen unit or bathroom, and leaving  
the rest of the apartment as unencum-  
bered as possible.  
The individual facade panels can be ad-  
justed manually to control the amount of  
sunlight, and the view into and out of the  
apartment as well as reduce traffic noise.

# SOLITAIRE  
# Solitaires indicate something singular, sometimes  
# unique. They are fully detached and receive natural  
# light from all sides; exterior form, orientation, and  
# height can be determined with great freedom. All  
# these factors offer ideal conditions for creating and  
# exploring exemplary housing models. Solitaires differ  
# primarily from one another with regard to scale\: the  
# small, suburban multifamily house or the urban villa  
# in an open city block are distinguished for their clar-  
# ity, their relationship to public and private green, the  
# occupants’ identifi cation with their home and with  
# their neighbours. The advantages of the single-family  
# house can be realized here within the more economi-  
# cal multifamily house. Large urban solitaires – the  
# courtyard house, the atrium house, or the small urban  
# block – are confi gurations with more complex ac-  
# cess systems and internal hierarchies, shared internal  
# and external spaces, and a great variety of apartment  
# types. A decisive factor for the interpretation as a soli-  
# taire is its urban presence\: in other words, whether the  
# building appears as an autonomous object. Naturally,  
# in doing so it can be integrated into an urban planning  
# concept that allocates an entire urban block with a  
# more or less stringent canon of regulations to a series  
# of solitaires.  
2.1 Piazza Carbonari |  
# Caccia Dominioni | 1961  
The 7-story apartment building is a free-  
standing urban structure in the vicinity  
of a large roundabout. The sculptural ap-  
pearance of the building is not only an  
end in itself\: the cubature and the gabled  
roof profile emerged as a compromise in  
response to the requirements set by the  
development guidelines and a desire for  
maximum utilization and height. The win-  
dows, which appear to be randomly placed,  
flush with the homogeneous ceramic skin  
and wrapped around all four facades like  
a pictorial composition that seems to  
ignore the structure of the floors, are in  
fact essentially a reflection of the internal  
organization of the building. The leitmotif  
for this project are stacked villas, each of  
which occupy an entire floor. Each villa  
has a unique floor plan\: with openings that  
serve rooms with different dimensions and  
uses. The skeleton construction allows for a  
very free floor plan design, which connects  
open spatial sequences with a series of  
smaller and more private spaces – accessed  
through an array of various corridors and  
hallways, around which other rooms are  
bundled in turn.  
These conjunctions of spaces form a  
floor plan, in which not everything is imme-  
diately revealed. The spatial sequences are  
only deciphered through the movements of  
the users, successively and in fluid changes  
of direction.

# Schudnagis | 1972  
The complex floor plan design evolved by  
rotating all apartments toward the shore-  
line and the landscape. Despite angled  
walls, a winding building fabric, and the  
stepped, pointed terraces, the layout of the  
floor plans is essentially economical and  
functional\: the rooms fan out from a cor-  
ridor in all directions, thus facing toward  
the various views. The most diverse apart-  
ment sizes and layouts are unified under  
one roof\: from the 25 m² 1-room apartment  
with minimal kitchen nook to the 156 m²  
apartment, which echoes the landscape  
outside in its sequence of terrace, patio,  
flower boxes, and seamless transitions  
between living spaces in the interior. The  
living rooms are extended upward and cre-  
ate space for a rooftop studio. The slope  
site is not only reflected in the apartments  
at the rear elevation, stepped back by one  
half story, it is also thematicized in that  
the living room that overlooks the water  
\(with the pointed terrace\) is always slightly  
lower than the rest of the rooms or by  
virtue of other changes in floor level, which  
add interest to the room layout. The design  
provides many built-in pieces of furniture  
and an open fireplace in the living room  
of the larger units. The garden floor ac-  
commodates garages, an indoor pool, and  
a sauna.

# Utida et al. | 1993  
This building was intended as an experi-  
ment in spatial, technical, and conceptual  
strategies to explore the development of  
flexible apartment buildings able to react  
long-term to the changing preferences of  
residents. The basic principle was formed  
by the “Open Building” concept of the  
Dutch architect John Habraken in which  
a building is understood as a composite  
of two systems\: the support system form-  
ing a stable and shared property and an  
infill system, which is individually owned  
and interchangeable. Here the concept  
was realized with a series of constituent  
subsystems\: a skeletal structure based  
on a multi-layered grid, a modular facade  
system and technical infrastructure that  
can be easily renewed at any time.  
U-shaped levels are laid out to enable  
the creation of completely different apart-  
ment types and sizes, and remain open to  
the neighboring buildings, thus providing  
room for green spaces. In contrast to the  
layouts of conventional apartment build-  
ings, which need to be standardized in  
order to anticipate the potential demands  
of future users, the conditions here proved  
congenial to having 18 residential units  
designed by 13 different architects in direct  
contact with the future residents of each.  
The individual designs are funda-  
mentally different from one another.  
Some \(apartment a, for example\) are  
reminiscent of the spatial character of a  
single-family home\: they are individually  
designed and comprised of two stories  
with wraparound facades. Others \(b, for  
example\) connect open living spaces with  
individual cabinet-like private rooms. And  
still others \(c, for example\) incorporate  
traditional Japanese elements such as  
sliding walls to create flexibility of use.  
The first unit conversions have success-  
fully illustrated the ability of this open  
framework to incorporate changes.

# Baumschlager Eberle | 1996  
Three houses situated rela­ tively close to  
each other. The facade, evenly broken  
down by floor-high windows, makes it im-  
possible to deduce the true inner arrange-  
ment of the house. A central stairwell with  
skylights allows access to four apartments  
on every landing. The symmetrically placed  
doors conceal, sur­ pris­ ingly, apartments  
of different sizes\: made possible by shift-  
ing a separating wall within the pattern  
established by the windows – one room  
per win­ dow – by one room module. Thus,  
two 3-room apart­ ments become a 2- and  
a 4-room apartment. The bedrooms are  
aligned along a corridor remaining private,  
whereby the round bathroom guides the  
visitor straight into the living space. The  
living rooms with kitchens and loggias are  
situated in the four corners of the build-  
ing. On the ground floor are three 2-room  
apartments and various kinds of ­ ancillary  
rooms.

# SOLITAIRE  
The dense residential complex consists of six  
compact, cube-shaped residential buildings in  
an attractive green space, each with an internal  
circulation and a prominent wraparound balcony  
layer, which can be completely closed off to  
its surroundings with copper screen elements.  
The buildings are offset to one another in a  
checkerboard pattern so as not to hinder outside  
views. A network of walkways, small courtyard-  
like spaces, and gardens on the ground floor  
form a communal area in the interstitial spaces.  
The apartments are accessed through a glazed  
atrium in which the elevator and staircase cores  
are situated. The sculptural character of this  
space stands in stark contrast to the rather  
modular outer appearance of the buildings.  
Within the apartments, a layer of entrance halls,  
sanitary, and storage rooms border the atrium,  
forming a transitional zone that serves both  
as a spatial buffer and a constructive element.  
Because the load-bearing walls run parallel and  
not perpendicular to the facades, the second  
layer of bedrooms and living areas can be subdi-  
vided as desired.

159 KNSM- and Java-Eiland |  
# Diener & Diener | 2001  
Two buildings, the long and the courtyard  
building, by Diener & Diener Architects  
bring structure into the transitional area of  
the new housing district in Amsterdam on  
the two peninsulas KNSM and Java, whose  
heterogeneous urban concepts converge  
at precisely this location \(see also Kollhoff,  
page 70\). The courtyard house with its  
unique plan is a cubic volume, whose  
eastern elevation is cantilevered across the  
access road. The concentric organization  
of the courtyard type and the orientation  
of the building fabrics in the axis of the  
peninsula have informed the building.  
The volume seems to be simultaneously  
in the grip of static and dynamic forces.  
This delicate balance is continued in the  
apartments, which are not hierarchically  
ordered\: with a long rectangular plan,  
with front or lateral windows and doors  
depending on location, the individual  
rooms convey a sense of tranquility and  
animation at the same time – much like  
the entire complex. This is a residential  
dwelling with a distinctly public character,  
which is conceived to also embrace ways  
of living outside of the traditional family  
model. The apartments, usually 8 per story,  
are generally composed of three large  
rooms. There are four types, two for corner  
units and two for units located at the core  
\(longitudinal/crosswise\). The latter feature  
a central live-in kitchen, which is equipped  
with floor-to-ceiling sliding elements for  
opening onto the glazed loggia, thereby  
linking the living within the unit with the  
communal space of the entire building, the  
courtyard.

From the outside, the residential block  
on the water’s edge appears uniform  
and monolithic. The interior courtyard,  
however, opens the view onto a complex  
and typologically interesting structure. A  
series of 33-m-deep “bridge” apartments,  
which are strung in a row from one exterior  
facade to the other, are staggered each by  
one crosswall depth to the rear and by one  
story to the top, the roof of one unit thus  
constituting the terrace of the unit above.  
This cascade of housing units divides the  
block interior into two distinct sections\:  
as the area of each stepped terrace wid-  
ens from floor to floor, the width of each  
atrium-like interior beneath the “bridge”  
apartments diminishes in equal measure.  
This sectional configuration is what makes  
this project so attractive. Parallel to these  
tiered levels, cascading stairs lead to the  
wraparound galleries that link all units.  
The floor plan arrangement of the standard  
apartments oriented to one side is  
rather more conventional\: the service zone  
lies parallel to the corridor, next to it is a  
hallway, which provides access first into  
the common area and then to the private  
spaces. The upper units offer roof terraces  
accessed via the loggias. The 100-m²-large  
living area of the bridge apartment, on the  
other hand, is only defined in very broad  
strokes\: a kitchen/WC core divides it into a  
zone oriented toward the exterior facade  
and another facing the generous terrace.  
A glazed loggia completes the interior at  
the far end and, on the opposite, lie the  
bedrooms with their own corridor and  
sanitary zone.

# Chiba | 2005  
The dense, typologically interesting com-  
plex of buildings in a suburb of Tokyo is  
located on an open site near the train  
station. Due to the location, the brief was  
to seek a structure that would be suitable  
both for single commuters and for fami-  
lies. The building consists of an envelope  
and a core, or rather many cores, which  
are arranged in a chessboard-like pattern  
in the interior. The envelope and core are  
linked by an interior corridor, which wraps  
around the interior in the form of a ring  
on each second level, thereby providing  
access to all units. The corridor is lit from  
both sides, from the outside via the series  
of loggias, and from the inside through  
the rhythmic disposition of the cores. The  
envelope consists of elongated, narrow,  
bright living areas with attached loggias  
oriented toward the urban context, while  
the core zone contains two-story living  
rooms overlooking the tranquil interior  
courtyards. The view into the garden from  
the kitchen – located behind the corridor  
– is sideways, while windows set high into  
the wall light the rather more introverted  
living space from the front. The service  
zones are housed between envelope and  
core\: the access corridor, or – in those  
positions where the maisonettes extend  
across the corridor – the installation cores.  
The apartments are composed of the dif-  
ferent sections of the horizontal space \(the  
envelope\) and the vertical space \(the cores\)  
into a multiplicity of forms. This fabric of  
different sections and types is intended to  
give the occupants a sense of individuality  
and distance from the next-door neigh-  
bour despite the density of the complex.

# Burkard Meyer | 2006  
This structure is primarily used as an  
administration building. Behind the dou-  
ble skin glass facade fitted with uniform  
drapes, the residential maisonettes located  
on the two top floors, are barely decipher-  
able as such from the outside. On the  
elevation overlooking the city, the volume  
has the appearance of a crystalline and  
homogeneous sculpture. However, a ring-  
shaped completion of fourteen maison-  
ettes arranged around a shared courtyard  
is situated above the office atrium and  
beneath a cantilevered roof. On one fa-  
cade, the continuous wooden deck opens  
up with a two-story loggia to the city;  
otherwise, this space exudes a tranquility  
that is almost reminiscent of a cloister.  
At the entrance to the apartments, two  
slightly offset lobbies – with the bottom  
landing of the stairs and the bathrooms  
to one side and the rooms i.e. apartment  
doors to the other side – separate the  
public and private areas of each unit.  
The open-plan living area is located on the  
upper level and reached via a set of single-  
flight stairs on the courtyard side, which  
defines the kitchen and dining areas. The  
conservatories, which are almost room  
size, extend the open-plan living area and  
are cantilevered over the courtyard. They  
also shelter the entrances below and give  
each unit a unique “face”. All rooms set  
along the outer facade benefit from a  
panoramic view of the city through floor-  
to-ceiling windows.

# Rondo | Graber Pulver | 2007  
The irregular pentagonal form of the build-  
ing was determined by the shape of the  
lot. In plan, the building layout is orga­ nized  
into ring-like layers with a generous, top-lit  
access and circulation atrium at the core.  
The space-defining cascading stairs within  
this atrium provide access to up to five  
units per floor. This strikingly sculptural  
space functions as a neighbourly inter-  
section and also gives each apartment a  
unique “address” thanks to the staggered  
stairs and alternating mezzanine sec-  
tions. All unit entrances are located in the  
corners of the atrium; in the apartments’  
interior, the space opens up, widening  
like a fan toward the outer corners and  
extending out onto the rounded balcony  
bays. The kitchen units are placed near  
the entrance – the first element in a series  
of ancillary rooms with bathrooms and  
storage rooms – offering anyone who  
enters an immediate focal point much  
like a counter. Bedrooms follow to the left  
and right, in part as a kind of private block  
inserted into the communal space, in part  
strung along small corridors on both sides.  
The building is clad in a layer of undulat-  
B  
ing, flexible metal mesh, which is perme-  
able to light while providing sun protection  
and a visual screen for privacy.

# LOHA | 2008  
Six maisonette apartments, front-to-back  
across all three levels, feature two-story  
open spaces on both sides and terminate  
in a floor entirely reserved for individual  
rooms on the third level. However, what  
sets this building apart is the transforma-  
tion of the standard layout of comparable  
maisonettes\: on the mezzanine level, the  
interior is liberated from the corset of the  
two dividing walls and is pushed into the  
adjacent apartment. On the one hand, this  
has the effect that the open living space is  
organized into three areas – soaring across  
two stories height at the two facades and  
low in the middle, where kitchen and WC  
are located. On the other hand, this solu-  
tion creates a unique space on the mez-  
zanine between the open living area below  
and the closed, predetermined individual  
rooms above, with sightlines in all direc-  
tions and suitable for a variety of flexible  
uses. The cave-like penetration into the  
adjacent unit creates a complex floor plan  
that defines the entire volume. Two apart-  
ments are combined into a unit, in which  
the inserted rooms are oriented in op-  
posite directions on one or the other side  
of the building. In this manner, the living  
areas too change in orientation with the  
inserted open patio on one side. The two  
penthouse apartments occupy the entire  
length of the building and are entwined in  
a meandering manner. Each unit is ori-  
ented toward two sides and surrounds one,  
i.e. two patios. The penthouse units are  
accessed from a shared roof patio, while  
a second entrance from the fire escape  
allows for divisions across the middle of  
the plan.

# NL Architects | 2009  
The complex is one of sixteen blocks, all  
of which were to adhere to a common  
rule\: to rise to two-and-a-half stories on a  
nearly square plan; the top level was to be  
half living area and half roof terrace and  
garden. The inventive interpretation of  
these stipulations forms the parameters  
for this design.  
The volume is divided into ten units  
of 633 m³ each, accessed via a diagonally  
inserted “minicanyon.” The units are turned  
inside out; in this manner, corridors,  
stairs and storage rooms do not take up  
valuable facade areas, instead the large  
rooms benefit from all available natural  
light. The undulating roof, with its extreme  
height fluctuations between 5 and 15 m,  
nevertheless achieves the stipulated two-  
and-a-half stories on average. As a result of  
the diagonal section, the different widths,  
and the roof profile, the units have very  
different cubatures. Although all have the  
same spatial volume – units with shallow  
depth have high rooflines and vice versa  
–, apartment size and number of stories  
do vary. What is unique, however, is that  
the interplay of these parameters creates  
very different room layouts, each of which  
has special characteristics\: tall and narrow  
i.e. low and deep rooms, roof terraces ac-  
cessed from a patio on a lower level, there  
are living rooms that soar towards the light,  
with galleries along the facade, or patios  
that are pushed into the double-height  
space. The roof terraces perforating the  
undulating green carpet of the roof surface  
are the defining element – as a fifth eleva-  
tion visible from all the directions, from the  
apartments as well as from the city.

2.1 Urban Villa 4 in 1 |  
# 2b architectes | 2011  
The crystalline shape of this urban villa follows  
the geometry of the plot and is embedded in  
the terrain, surrounded on three sides by a re-  
taining wall. On the fourth side, a sunken level  
leads to a four-story glazed atrium belying the  
unique structure of this building and forming  
a common point of reference for all residents  
through which each unit can be accessed, one  
per side. The apartments are laid out over mul-  
tiple levels connected by an internal staircase  
running from one corner to the next, wrapping  
around the central atrium like superimposed  
spirals. This interlocking relationship combines  
the advantages of shared living within a dense  
urban form with the conceptual characteristics  
of a freestanding home. The rooms of each unit  
are distributed over all levels throughout the  
building, providing views in all directions. Each  
unit has its own garage next to the entrance  
and a private garden plot.  
The organizational uniformity in com-  
bination with the complex geometric shape  
facilitates a wide range of sizes, functions, and  
spatial situations. This results in double-height  
rooms, voids in the building corners where  
rooms overlap, as well as apartments that  
distribute eat-in kitchens and living spaces  
over two levels or connect them within a single  
room. One of the units is used as an office.  
On the facade, the inner layers of the build-  
ing are expressed by the varied finishes of the  
concrete surfaces accentuating the outline of  
each apartment, whereas the sculptural char-  
acter of the entire building is emphasized by a  
free composition of openings.

# 5468796 Architecture | 2011  
The apartments in this project were de-  
signed according to the “white box” princi-  
ple\: an unfinished unit with the essential  
sanitary, heating, and electric installations  
is purchased, after which each buyer can  
then determine the surface materials  
based on personal taste, the available  
budget, and how the spaces on the three  
levels will be used. Office spaces can for  
instance be built out on the ground floor,  
while the living and dining rooms are  
spread over two floors or combined. The  
top floor can be used as either a living  
room or bedroom.  
In contrast to the standard convention  
where each level of a residential unit is di-  
rectly above the other, or where all rooms  
are spread out on a single floor, the three  
levels of each apartment spring from one  
side of the building to the other, forming  
a linear cascade of spaces from one build-  
ing segment to the next. They are con-  
nected by a series of interior staircases  
above and behind one another, which  
form a sort of backbone down the mid-  
section of the entire building. The result  
is very different unit types with surprising  
spatial organization and exterior views.  
Complementing the inner access core  
– integrating the technical infrastructure  
that enables the flexible placement of  
sanitary rooms within each apartment  
segment and on all levels – and the 3-sto-  
ry units, which wind their way around  
one another, is another spatial layer. The  
difference between the permitted building  
volume and the interior volume is used  
to create a series of cut-out open spaces  
clad with wooden lamellae across most  
of the facade surface. Depending on the  
point of view, the building looks either  
like a solid sculptural object or an open  
structure.

# Architecture | 2013  
Located on a corner lot of an important  
east-west thoroughfare in Lyon, two soli-  
tary volumes are offset from one another  
to form two small squares – one towards  
the heavily trafficked intersection, the  
other towards the quiet block interior. The  
floor plan of the 20 m deep volumes is  
characterized by several concentric spatial  
layers wrapped around one another\: a  
narrow access corridor is located in the  
middle axis followed on both sides by a  
layer containing the stairwells, elevators  
and entrance halls, and bathrooms of  
the individual apartments. Following this  
is a ring of connected living spaces with  
predominantly two access points each,  
opening up their potential use to interpre-  
tation. Surrounding these interior layers  
is a double-skinned facade, which while  
providing a traffic noise buffer also im-  
parts the buildings with their monolithic  
character. Loggias and the kitchens, which  
remain open to the living space, occupy  
the space within the double facade.  
Within this strict organizational sys-  
tem, various divisions and connections,  
set either parallel or perpendicular to the  
structural layers, allow the creation of dif-  
ferently sized apartments and floor plans\:  
small and large apartments, duplex units,  
some of which have double-height living  
rooms and loggias, and on the top floor,  
apartments with patios located on the  
buildings’ perimeter. On the sides of the  
patios, small spaces are created between  
the double facades, with views in almost  
every direction.

Located in a wooded urban district with  
open blocks, this ensemble consists of  
three very different structures. While the  
renovated villa and the atelier house are  
reflective of the surrounding hetero-  
geneous building types, the residential  
building in the center adheres to its own  
design language. Formally inspired by the  
protected tree stock of the vicinity as well  
as the structure of rock formations, the  
built figure is embossed with vertically  
alternating surfaces and shaped to leave  
enough room for the surrounding trees.  
The result is a floor plan with four multi-  
faceted wings, which appear to grow into  
the clearings.  
The resulting amorphous shape  
continues on the inside and is translated  
in the building’s footprint – with one  
apartment in each wing – into a cluster  
of adjoined, skewed polygons. These  
combine to create a succession of open  
spatial linkages which widen and narrow,  
allow diverse views into the surroundings  
or connect to neighboring rooms. A spa-  
tial path thus emerges in each of the four,  
slightly vertically offset apartments. The  
path begins at an entrance hall directly  
accessed by elevator; it is at times an-  
gled toward one or the other view of the  
garden while leading past an initial living  
space, then narrows near the kitchen and  
opens at the end into a living room lit  
naturally from three sides – one of which  
contains a loggia. Enclosed “chambers”  
with intentionally smaller doors lie along  
this path and join to form separate groups  
of rooms – for instance with their own  
corridor, bathroom, dressing room, or as  
connected bedrooms.

# LINEAR BLOCK / SUPERBLOCK  
# This chapter combines the typologies linear block and  
# superblock, which are similar in appearance. As an ur-  
# ban planning leitmotif of modernism, which promoted  
# less dense developments with light, air, and sun, linear  
# blocks were the antithesis to the tenement city and  
# their enclosed block-edge developments in the late  
# 19th century. For a long time, linear block develop-  
# ments were the ideal solution for societies that had  
# a pressing need for inexpensive housing on a large  
# scale. Owing to their serial construction method, linear  
# blocks are characterized by systematic fl oor plans,  
# which nevertheless allow for some variation within  
# the rhythm of the dividing walls and the changes from  
# fl oor to fl oor \(one-level apartment, maisonette, triplex  
# or split-level type\). A variety of access systems, such as  
# landings, galleries, or internal streets are possible. Ide-  
# ally with an east-west orientation, they occupy tailor-  
# made urban spaces with dedicated traffi c areas and  
# green spaces and are often accompanied by functional  
# segregation\: the occupant works, shops, and spends  
# his or her leisure time in different locations; the estate  
# becomes effectively a “dormitory town.” Linear blocks  
# were the dominant building type in large estates for a  
# long time, arranged in serial rows facing one another  
# and forming open, often monotonous urban spaces.  
# The superblock is larger in scale, more complex  
# than the linear block and nearly always a solitary  
# structure; it is a massive, large volume whose domi-  
# nant, often sculptural presence can structure an entire  
# urban situation. Multilayered variations characterize  
# the interior of the complex fabric\: different apartment  
# sizes and types for different housing requirements  
# complement one another, accompanied by interlinked  
# vertical and horizontal access spaces. Common areas  
# and services not only structurally shape the residential  
# community inside the building, but also the exterior of  
# the superblock. This is a case of unity in diversity\: the  
# superblock is thus a quintessentially urban building  
# form. Introduced in the 1950s – at the time usually as  
# a series of always identical apartments arranged along  
# a corridor or internal access street – it has continually  
# evolved up to the present time, and has now been re-  
# discovered as an urban building block appreciated for  
# its unlimited variety. In the meantime, linear block and  
# superblock are no longer employed solely for mu-  
# nicipality-owned social housing; they are now being  
# constructed – sometimes in single and shorter form –  
# for all social strata and utilized for urban densifi cation  
# and agglomerations.  
2.2 Unité d’Habitation |  
# Le Corbusier | 1947  
The “machine for living” model\: pro-  
totype of an autarchic housing unit  
as module for a new town-planning  
scheme. The building is set freely into  
the landscape and oriented entirely ac-  
cording to the course of the sun\: clear  
east-west orientation. Optimization  
of floor plans according to Corbusier’s  
“Modulor” measurements and laws of  
insolation. A central access corridor  
\(every two or three stories, without  
natural lighting\) is surrounded by four  
basic spatial modules \(criterion of  
industrial construction\) that are varied  
in up to three levels and three parallel  
units. This allows a variety of apart-  
ment sizes and layouts, a total of 23  
floor plan types were developed for  
this project. All apartments \(except for  
the 1-room apts.\) are maisonettes. The  
great room depth between the two only  
3.66-m-wide crosswalls is utilized to  
maximum advantage; the apartments  
follow consistent zoning \(relationship  
between incidence of light and depth  
of room\). Living rooms or joint play  
areas open up toward outside \(living  
rooms are always two stories, opening  
out to continuous terraces\); bedrooms  
\(minimized\) on upper floor \(galleries\)  
or on setback story below; sanitary  
rooms and kitchens toward central  
corridor. Through-living spaces, both  
horizontal and vertical. Large common  
terrace on roof \(recreation facilities\).  
Comprehensive service facilities \(hotel,  
businesses, offices, and restaurants\)  
on two full stories \(level 7/8\), like gym,  
pool; also crèche and kindergarten.

there access to the sleeping-room hallway,  
which can be optionally incor­ porated into  
or separated from the living space, by  
means of folding doors. Deep loggias in  
front of living spaces, also accessible from

# LINEAR BLOCK /  
# SUPERBLOCK  
This slab unites a building type inspired  
by Le Corbusier with Japanese domes-  
tic culture. On every third level of the  
exposed concrete structure there is a  
spacious outdoor access gallery from  
which perpendicular staircases lead to the  
floors above and below. The use of built-in  
wooden carpentry and the clear division  
of the floor plan are inspired by traditional  
Japanese building types, in which a kitchen  
and dining area have wooden floors, while  
tatami mats line the floor of the sleeping  
and living areas. Sliding walls and storage  
nooks for futons allow different usage  
scenarios. On the access levels, the units  
are organized parallel to the volume and  
entered through the kitchen, from which  
the WC, bathroom area, and two rooms are  
accessed. On the floors above and below,  
they are organized perpendicular to the  
volume. Here, the unit is divided into four  
parallel zones\: one strip is occupied by  
storage spaces, bathroom, WC, and the  
shared staircase, followed by a hallway-  
like space with a mini-kitchen and wide  
enough to double as a living room. In the  
adjacent zone, two rooms can be con-  
nected to one another or the hallway by  
sliding walls. The meandering dividing wall  
creates niches for furniture or storage.

Access to buildings by means of double-  
height entry vestibules \(“hotel atmosphere”\).  
In the suspended mezzanine  
story, small apartments for the elderly  
with hallway entries. Elsewhere, double-  
and triple-loaded stairwells around open  
elevator and stair cores. Free plan layouts  
are possible since only the outer walls and  
shafts are load-bearing \(21 different types  
of floor plans, additional changes by ten-  
ants also possible\). Generally\: clear sepa-  
ration of living and sleeping zones, both  
always directly accessible from entrance  
hall. Organization of living room, kitchen,  
dining area always handled differently\:  
kitchen between living and dining areas;  
separate kitchen with dining area in living  
room; linear kitchen with dining area at  
the end, parallel to living room; or central  
kitchen as focal point of plan, with access  
to balcony. The bedrooms are always lined  
up along a separate corridor, bath and WC  
are invariably separated. Each apartment  
has one or two, often large, balconies.  
Maisonettes, terrace apartments, and  
studios on roof level.  
Lower levels of maisonettes have bedrooms,  
baths, kitchens, and an expanded  
double-height dining area \(small living  
room\). The stairs between bath and dining  
area open above into a long gallery leading  
to a large living room \(or ­ living/bedroom\).  
A number of sports and leisure facilities\:  
on ground floor level laundry rooms,  
common rooms, and daycare center. Semi-

2.2 Robin Hood Gardens |  
# Smithson | 1972  
The leitmotif of the complex are the so-  
called “streets in the sky,” broad covered  
walkways designed to create a neighbourly  
urban space for socializing. Located be-  
tween two major thoroughfares, Robin  
Hood Gardens is an island in a sea of  
traffic. The complex consists of two long,  
sculptural blocks – one of seven stories,  
the other of ten –, forming a protective  
enclosure around a landscaped green area  
with a small hill made from construc-  
tion rubble and sheltered depressions as  
children’s play areas. The bends in the  
blocks are utilized for access and in part as  
storage areas. The walkways provide access  
to apartments in units comprised of three  
levels, in which various types of maison-  
ettes alternate with the apartments and  
are continued on the floor above or below.  
Some two meters in width, the walkways  
are even wider in front of the entrances,  
which are set off to the side, creating  
niche-like anterooms. In the interior, the  
maisonette stairs run parallel to this en-  
trance area, thereby creating a buffer zone  
for the adjacent combined kitchen and  
dining area. On the upper level, the stairs  
lead through the corner of the living room  
into a corridor, the meandering layout of  
which subtly separates public from pri-  
vate spaces. On this level, the bedrooms  
are largely oriented toward the quieter  
courtyard and linked via a narrow balcony.  
The garden or ground floor contains apart-  
ments for seniors and families with direct  
access from the outside.

2.2 Buchgrindel II | Hotz | 1985  
Compact double row as an autonomous  
urban module\: open spaces and rooftop  
terraces are cut into the built volume from  
outside. Inside is a residential street that  
runs along the longitudinal axis of the  
building, closed to the outside by gates  
and offering a starting point for the stair-  
wells. On the upper stories, bridges link the  
two blocks, thus creating lightwells. A mix-  
ture of apartments\: the small apartments  
with open spaces cut into the building  
volume are located on the ground floor.  
The upper floors contain larger apart-  
ments, which extend from one side to the  
other. Work area, dining area, kitchen, and  
bath are located on the lightwells, with liv-  
ing and sleeping to the outside. The apart-  
ments on the third floor have two-story  
high living rooms with access via spiral  
staircases to large rooftop terraces. On the  
fourth floor, the living room stretches from  
the stairwell core across the bridge all the  
way to the exterior wall. It integrates the  
entrance area, kitchen, and dining area and  
opens toward the sleeping zone on the one  
side, and toward the building corner with  
recessed terraces on the other. Communal  
secondary and storage rooms between  
the apartments are located on the ground  
floor.

2.2 Avenue du Général Leclerc |  
# Nouvel, Ibos | 1987  
Two long, ship-like buildings on a  
mediterranean square with large plane  
trees. The open basement serves as  
a cover­ ed parking lot, the cars, hid-  
den on the level lowered by a half  
story, are no longer visible from the  
grove of plane trees. The building is  
composed of two maisonettes, i.e.  
double floors, stacked one above the  
other, and an attic ­ story. Every second  
story has 3-m-wide, perimeter galler-  
ies, which serve as covered walkways  
on the north side and as balconies on  
the south side. The fabrics are divided  
into 5-m-wide crosswall sections. The  
maisonettes can be completed without  
further structural constraints, the only  
fixed component being the location of  
the installation shaft. Aside from a few  
interior walls, the otherwise undivided  
space is defined by the bathroom and  
kitchen core, often set into the space,  
and the maisonette stairwell. Most of  
the apartments occupy one crosswall  
width and are developed vertically  
as two- or three-story maisonettes.  
Bathrooms and kitchens lie mostly  
on the north side, the living areas,  
many two-stories high, open onto the  
balcony. The building is executed as a  
rough concrete structure, made inhab-  
itable with simple, prefabricated ele-  
ments adopted from 1980s industrial  
architecture\: galvanized folding doors  
open the living space onto the terrace,  
the entrance doors are made of steel  
sheet, a red alarm button serves as a  
door bell.

Each of the four buildings is designed  
as a symmet­ rical urban villa, with four  
completely identical apartments per story.  
From the street side the buildings appear  
closed, everything that leaves an imprint  
of its particular function on the facade  
\(kitchens, stairwells, balconies, etc.\) has  
been placed on the garden side. The floor  
plans are developed in two directions\: one  
parallel to the street with an optional living  
room/reception area and two additional  
bedrooms; the other, more dominant plan,  
in the diagonal line leads out to increas-  
ing brightness – with lobby, dining area,  
loggia, and a room overlooking the garden.  
Corridor segments around the dining  
area connect all rooms. The functions of  
the spatial sequences can be freely  
determined.

Ten identical multifamily buildings along  
a private path\: despite the repetition of  
the symmetrical housing type, the com-  
plex still appears varied and open. Thanks  
to the staggered building ends, no two  
floors are alike. One room of the preceding  
apartment serves as a – partially covered  
– terrace for the unit above. An apart-  
ment is situated in each building corner,  
with rooms arranged along a corridor.  
An entrance foyer leads to the corridor;  
the bathrooms and kitchen are lined up  
along the interior, the bedrooms on the  
exterior. The living room is straight ahead.  
Both kitchen and living room open onto  
the terrace. In the 4-room apartments on  
the back side, the living room is located  
directly off the foyer space. The corridor is  
transformed into a private space. A tree-  
lined boulevard between the rows serves  
as a communal green space, and the roof  
terrace is for shared use.

2.2 Nexus World | Holl | 1991  
The aim of the housing strategy\: variety of  
apartment types and, in each individual  
apartment, great flexibility of spatial divi-  
sions by means of rotating wall sections  
and shelving units. \(Spatial division accord-  
ing to times of day\: bedrooms become part  
of the living room/spatial division accord-  
ing to periods of life\: parts of the apart-  
ment can be separated off.\) The problem  
of the site\: the street is in the south. Hence  
the comb-shaped plan, with inner court-  
yards on the south side \(the courtyards  
are filled with water basins that reflect  
the light and are intended to symbolize  
peace and tranquility\). Covered walkways  
with differing orientation, south or north,  
in part enclosed and in part open; stair-  
wells located at both ends of the building.  
Basically there are two arrangements for  
the maison­ ettes\: 1. The maisonettes have  
their living areas in the individual wings;  
the sleeping area, set off by one floor and  
pushed toward the back, lies in the con-  
tinuous bar \(light from east, south, west,  
north\). 2. The maisonettes are stacked on  
top of each other in the continuous bar  
\(light from south and north\). Meandering  
paths with intermediate landings i.e. stairs  
lead from the entrances past one or two  
bedrooms to the central living area, which  
frequently provides direct access to two  
additional bedrooms.

# K25 | Zaaijer, Christiaanse | 1992  
The project is located on a strip of the  
city on which The Hague’s social housing  
festival was held. The festival’s urban plan  
asked for a maximum of transparency –  
paradoxically – from the superblock, as  
this specific site marks the border between  
a residential and a green zone. Zaaijer  
Diagramm 1\:500 - Bezugsmass insg. 2 cm ! ! ! !  
Zaaijer - Den Haag  
and Christiaanse, who also conceived the  
master plan, recognized the challenge and  
put the bar on pilotis \(with parking below\)  
and gave their building two distinct sides\:  
one, of stone, to the street; the second,  
dematerializing in glass and balconies  
facing the canal. Moreover, they perfo-  
rated the bar with 3 openings in which  
the circulation and communal terraces  
are visible from the street. These perfora-  
tions divide the very deep building into  
three sections, each with its own access.  
The entire building has an abundance  
of offerings\: various apartment types for  
different resident groups; various forms  
of access \(central corridor on the 4th and  
6th floor, gallery on the 2nd floor\) as well  
as gigantic communal terraces and indoor  
spaces for flexible use according to the  
desires of the residents. These can also  
be joined with the apartments to permit  
different living arrangements. Like the  
building as a whole, the floor plans of the  
individual units offer tremendous flex-  
ibility. The bath and kitchen complex is as  
compact as possible, there are as few walls  
as possible. The resident is called upon to  
design his/her own living environment. The  
apartments on the second floor are either  
continuous \(1½ crosswall widths\) or devel-  
oped around the corner at the head of the  
block. The maisonettes adjoin the central  
corridor \(1 crosswall width\). At access level,  
they feature one room \(kitchen with dining  
area, or bedroom with bathroom\); on the  
level above or below, respectively, they of-  
fer a continuous living space \(with kitchen  
or a generous sleeping area\).

2.2 Bahnhofstrasse |  
# Riegler, Riewe | 1994  
A concrete bar of precise and  
uncompromising structure which  
offers great flexibility within its  
rules. The extruded-looking building  
is not subordinate to its haphaz-  
ard surroundings. Rather, it sits  
autonomously in the landscape.  
The smooth facade is unfettered  
by loggias or balconies. It comes  
alive instead through the animated  
image of floor-high sliding shutters.  
On the east elevation, these shut-  
ters are made of expanded metal  
and provide visual protection; on  
the west side, they are made of  
metal frames with nylon fabric and  
filter sunlight. They conceal French  
windows. Opening to 180°, these  
windows transform the living room  
into a loggia. Basically, there exists  
only one, albeit extremely flexible,  
apartment type in the building – in  
smaller and larger versions\: the  
rooms offer a functional openness  
thanks to their size, shape, and in-  
dividual entrance area. The plan can  
be read in two ways with the spaces  
ordered lengthwise or transversely  
into three zones \(41/2-room apt.\).  
Length­ wise\: living rooms and bed-  
rooms along the two outer sides, the  
service core \(hall, kitchen, bathroom\)  
in the middle. Transverse\: first axis, a  
half-bedroom \(7.5 m2\) and guest WC;  
second axis, living room and kitchen;  
third axis, two bedrooms and bath-  
room. The spaces are connected  
lengthwise by wide sliding doors  
and transversely by folding doors.  
The spaces can thus be linked with  
complete flexibility. There is one  
additional variation\: occupants can  
request that the kitchen be located  
in the small room on the west side.

Kovatsch - Graz  
# Tyroltgasse |  
# Kovatsch | 1994  
The clear, structure-giving form of a  
110-meter-long double row is placed  
within a haphazardly developed residen-  
tial area. A glass-roofed hall joins the two  
parallel north-south rows. It serves as a  
means of access and communal room. The  
hall’s strong linearity is softened by the  
maisonettes’ entrance porches \(first and  
second floor\), their colored boxes pushing  
forwards at an angle into the corridor. The  
maisonettes’ entrances and bathrooms  
lie towards the passageway with all other  
rooms facing their own individual gardens.  
Two steps elevate and separate the living  
room from the kitchen \(and, depending  
on the plan, an additional bedroom\). The  
stairs have a high window towards the  
hall and lead up to further bedrooms and  
the bathroom. The third-floor apartments  
are reached via slightly curved access  
galleries which cantilever into the hall  
and are linked by bridges at three points.  
These single-story apartments consist of  
a string of identical rooms, kitchen, living  
room or bedroom, and a zone of unspecified  
use in front facing the hall. This area  
is used as access to the rooms, but it is  
also broad enough for working or playing.  
The living room – not separated from the  
kitchen – can carry over into this zone to  
the corridor, and across to the garden via  
the balcony in the opposite direction. Also  
at the disposal of the residents, who have  
deliberately chosen a form of communal  
living, is a range of other rooms and work-  
shops at each end of the row.

# Dercon, T’Jonck, Van Broeck | 1996  
Double row. This is part of an urban plan  
intended to refurbish the impoverished  
Scheldekaai industrial area along the  
banks of the Nederschelde. Although the  
ambitious urban planning scheme won  
the architects the competition, it has been  
realized only partially and thus the build-  
ing stands alone at present. It is divided  
into a principal row and a secondary row.  
The secondary row stacks garage and stor-  
age spaces at the bottom, children’s rooms  
above, and is topped by spacious roof ter-  
races. The colorful principal row contains  
all remaining functions, the circulation  
area, and other apartments. The gener-  
ous access \(three stairwells and two lifts\)  
is oriented towards the semipublic alley  
between the rows. Small apartments with  
gardens, ideally suited for the elderly, are  
arranged on the ground floor. Large five-  
room apartments for families with children  
are on the second floor. A master bed-  
room, living room with balcony, kitchen,  
storage, and guest WC are grouped around  
the central bathroom. The three separate  
children’s bedrooms \(with WC\), all lined up  
side by side above the garages, are reached  
via a wood-clad bridge. The roof terrace is,  
in turn, reached by a stair parallel to this  
bridge. On the third floor, one finds 2- and  
3-room apartments with identical layouts.  
Their bridges open onto large roof terraces.  
Above are similar 3-room apartments  
with balconies. The western row, without  
lift, accommodates 2-room apartments  
\(for singles\) with large kitchens and two  
smaller rooms.

2.2 Kitagata |  
# Sejima, Nishizawa | 1998  
This housing development bent along the  
contour of the lot is part of a large hous-  
ing scheme built by four women architects  
in Gifu. The structure is raised on pilotis,  
providing space at ground level for parking  
and allowing access to the complex from  
all sides. The crosswall type of construction  
determines the structure of the building  
in its entirety – with each crosswall unit  
corresponding to one room regardless of  
the allocated use. Each apartment consists  
of a combination of eat-in kitchen and  
living room, loggia, and a varying number  
of rooms on one or two levels. Half of the  
units even feature a two-story space. All  
rooms in each apartment are linked via a  
“sunlit corridor” \(with washstands\), whose  
floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto the  
landscape. The apartments, and all private  
rooms individually, are provided with ac-  
cess from the continuous covered walkway  
on the side of the building that is exposed  
to the elements, in other words, each of  
the private \(or bed-\)rooms is accessible  
from two sides \(suitable for renting\). The  
loggias – true “open spaces” – perforate  
the facade and, in combination with the  
ex­ tremely shallow building depth \(lighting,  
ventilation\), contribute to the pronounced  
light character of the building. The varia-  
tions in plan and elevation create a stimu-  
lating facade image on both sides. The  
access side with its diagonal strings of fire-  
escape stairs and the mesh wire skin, as  
well as the glazed side facing the sun, also  
make the movements of the inhabitants  
perceptible from the outside, thus bringing  
more movement into the facade.

2.2 Kölner Brett | b&k+  
# brandlhuber&kniess GbR | 1999  
In a quarter characterized by converted  
factories, a new building has been created,  
which offers a deliberate interpretation of  
the appeal and advantages of such con-  
verted structures and utilizes them for its  
own purposes. The architects have formu-  
lated a conscious response to the changing  
lifestyles and the growing integration of  
living and working. The building is com-  
posed of 12 identical modules, consisting  
of a 1-story section and a 2-story section  
\(optional 2nd level\). By rotating and cre-  
ating a mirror image of this basic unit,  
they have achieved 8 different modules  
of tremendous spatial variety, which can  
be further increased by connecting indi-  
vidual modules. The individual volumes  
are completely usage-neutral – they are  
handed over without kitchen and bath-  
room – and are so inspiring in their spatial  
arrangement that they invite immediate  
occupation. Buyers are offered a variety of  
options. Thus, there were three different  
sanitary units for installation in the 1-story  
section; a detailed handbook explains  
where the attachment points are located,  
from which galleries can be suspended as  
desired, among ­ other things; steel stairs  
are available upon request. However, the  
buyers were also free to complete the  
interiors entirely on their own. Due to soil  
contamination, the site had to be fully  
sealed and open spaces were therefore  
integrated on the roof or on top of the  
access structure to the rear of the building.  
The wide access bridges of this attached  
structure feature integrated planted bor-  
ders and serve as additional semipublic  
balconies or terraces.

2.2 Maia I | Rocha | 1999  
The subsidized housing program called  
upon the architects to manage with a  
significant reduction in funds – a topic that  
was treated as the defining design theme\:  
limitation to two room sizes \(single/dou-  
ble\), two apartment sizes, two window  
sizes, etc. The rigidity of this repetition  
invests the slab with a presence on the  
outside, which is intended to promote an  
urban restructuring of the sprawling sub-  
urb. The floor plans are characterized by  
a pronounced simplicity. They are divided  
lengthwise in two\: one row of living and  
bedrooms runs parallel to a sequence of  
service rooms. A small hallway provides  
access to the living room, and also, in a  
straight line to the galley kitchen, which  
leads to another hallway to bedroom,  
bathroom, and laundry room. The second  
hallway is large enough to accommodate  
a dining area or to be used for other  
purposes. The division of the floor plan in  
two is also visible on the facade. On the  
street elevation, the latter is perforated  
with small, square windows, which light  
the service zone, while the brick facade  
overlooking the garden is structured with  
window ribbons running the length of the  
building. These ribbons consist of an equal  
number of opaque and transparent areas;  
it is interesting to note that in this case it  
is the timber elements that are the mov-  
able components. The basement houses  
storage areas, as well as a common room  
in the above-ground area of the concrete  
plinth fronted by a terrace. This floor plan  
model was applied to a variety of building  
projects in the community, with strong  
variations in the length and height of the  
slab.

2.2 St. Alban-Ring |  
# Morger & Degelo | 2002  
A building slab located on the boundary  
between two very different urban areas\: on  
one side, a street followed by an elevated  
highway and interregional railway line; on  
the other side, a townhouse district with  
an adjacent public park. The building has  
been pushed right up to the edge of the  
street to leave as much space as possible  
on the more attractive side overlooking the  
park. Each standard floor contains alter-  
nating 3- and 4-room apartments, with  
the stairwell occupying the space of what  
would be the fourth room in the smaller  
units. The interiors are characterized by a  
pronounced shift in direction\: one enters  
into an elongated space with kitchen and  
dining area parallel to the street. At a right  
angle, a narrow passage leads from this  
space to the generously proportioned  
living room overlooking the park on the  
other side. This is where the large balcony  
is located, onto which the bedrooms also  
open. The result is a surprising diagonal  
relationship between the two shared living  
areas, connected via the small passage.  
The private spaces, which surround and  
shape this shared open area, are preceded  
by a separate hallway with bathroom. The  
building was partially lowered on the park  
side to accommodate apartments that are  
oriented toward one side only and hobby/  
recreation rooms in the basement. The  
polygonal shape of the balconies invests  
the garden facade with an undulating  
movement, which is continued – in a more  
restrained fashion – on the street side.

Although this residential development is  
conceived as an expansion to an exist-  
ing student housing complex, its plan  
can easily be applied to other residential  
developments in different contexts. There  
is a clear separation – both in the internal  
organization and in the external appear-  
ance – between a closed sequence of  
individual rooms and an open progression  
of living spaces along the light covered  
walkway. The spatial composition of the  
living room is exemplary\: the contours of  
the walkway, the inserted prefabricated  
sanitary cores, and the built-in closets in  
the individual rooms projecting into the  
living room, create designated zones that  
are differentiated in a completely unforced  
manner. The bays of the walkway become  
an exterior space for socializing; in the in-  
terior, the kitchen plan resembles a niche;  
the large dining area, crosswise to the  
kitchen, functions as the center; an open  
vestibule, the sitting area and anterooms  
that expand into two rooms each, are  
screened off by the sanitary core. The living  
area promotes visual contact to and from  
the outside, allows for ease of circulation  
and simultaneously inspires inhabitants  
to put the various zones to the uses for  
which they were intended. Access via the  
walkways is designed to promote commu-  
nication among residents. The stairwells  
at the far ends of the buildings feature  
open entrance zones, and the basement  
level of each building accommodates a  
party room and other common areas. The  
lower-lying roof areas serve as large patios  
for all residents. Lilac bushes between the  
buildings create a filter between the indi-  
vidual spaces, each row with its own hue  
and perfume.

# Steib Architekten AG | 2006  
The two-story balcony patios staggered  
on the southwest facade are the most  
distinctive feature of these apartments. In  
combination with the eat-in kitchen and  
the living rooms, these large, sheltered  
spaces provide a bright and spacious  
living area. Two-meter-high balustrades  
transform them into intimate patios by  
providing shelter from the elements and  
a visual screen toward surrounding high-  
rises. A cutout in the man-high balustrade  
frames a picture-book vista onto the  
landscape near the Uetliberg mountain.  
The floor plans are divided into four paral-  
lel layers. On the one side lies a continuous  
sequence of individual rooms, all identical  
in size, with every second apartment on  
the ground floor featuring one additional  
room. Stairwells and bathrooms are con-  
tained in a strip located at the core, while  
living areas and the balcony patios are  
situated along the front of the building.  
The kitchens are recessed as if in a niche,  
providing visual contact with the outside  
with a strip window above the patio of the  
apartment below. The four spatial layers  
are linked with each other via a nearly  
symmetrically arranged central axis. On the  
ground floor, the five stairwells are con-  
nected by a public walkway with two ac-  
cess points; this floor also accommodates  
meeting areas of the housing complex\:  
additional studio spaces for rent, live-in  
studios, a common room, and storage  
rooms for strollers and bicycles.

# Neff Neumann | 2006  
The goal of this urban planning concept  
– leaving sufficient space on one side  
of a historic city wall and formulating a  
spatial border to a 1950s development  
on the other side – yielded a simple,  
albeit very deep volume \(21 m building  
depth\). The floor plan layout responds  
to this building depth by featuring nar-  
row enclosed and open atria inserted in  
the volume, and loggias along the west  
facade, which are open on two sides.  
The open living area forms an  
L-shape around these open spaces\: the  
inserted block with kitchen counters  
and built-in closet reprises the shape  
and defines areas for access, cooking,  
dining, and living. The bedrooms and  
bathrooms – again in an L-plan –  
adjoin this area. The arrangement of  
living area, atrium, and loggia allows for  
complex sightlines through different  
spatial layers, both horizontal and verti-  
cal, resulting in a stimulating ambiguity  
in the perception of the spaces, be  
they interior or exterior, accessible or  
nonaccessible. In each second segment,  
the access cores occupy the space of a  
bedroom and bathroom\: thus, although  
the apartments appear identical from  
the outside, they are of different sizes  
on the inside and are accessed from  
different sides.

# Hardegg | Matti Ragaz Hitz | 2008  
The long building \(225 m long\), six free-  
standing buildings and a building with  
kindergarten and daycare facilities are  
conceived to give the former industrial  
site a new urban identity. The great vari-  
ety of apartment types from studios on  
the ground floor to loft apartments and  
various duplex types is geared toward  
appealing to a wide range of potential  
residents, creating a sense of urban com-  
munity. On the standard floors of the  
long building, the apartments are rotated  
away from the axis, dynamically oriented  
toward the exterior with balconies on both  
sides. This rotation results in a cruciform  
layout, which lends itself to a variety of  
floor plans. In one variation, three equally  
sized rooms form a sequence across the  
depth of the units\: the bedrooms on the  
facade side open onto the balcony at right  
angles, while the open room at the center  
functions as interface and intersection.  
The longitudinal sides of this space adjoin  
the bathrooms and stairwell and, with a  
set back, lead into two additional rooms,  
which open onto the balconies on the far  
side. This results in a diagonal layout to  
the open, loft-like living room with the  
bedrooms at the end. In another variation,  
the rooms create a front-to-back continu-  
ous space followed by a series of bed-  
rooms along side corridors with a similar  
set back and cruciform room disposition  
as above. All living areas are open from  
balcony to balcony, generously oriented  
toward the environment. The two crested  
attic stories accommodate apartments  
and large maisonettes with front-to-back  
roof patios.  
The single-floor and duplex units in the  
freestanding buildings are open on three  
sides with loggias at the corners.

2.2 Station Illnau |  
# Guignard & Saner | 2010  
Despite its location between a train station  
and village center, this mixed residential  
and commercial ensemble is molded by  
the landscape. It consists of two linear  
slab blocks and a solitary building nestled  
into the sloped, meadow-like topography.  
A staircase descends from the train sta-  
tion to pathways leading to the building  
entrances. One of the paths pierces the  
long slab, continuing on eastward towards  
the village.  
In the flats in the long slab \(Building a\),  
the enclosed rooms and an inserted core  
define the boundaries for an open but  
subtly zoned living area. The lengthwise  
orientation of the staircase, the position of  
the bathroom core, and the arrangement  
of the individual rooms and loggia create  
an open sequence of rooms offset to one  
another – with a large hallway, living and  
dining areas connected by the kitchen, and  
an additional room which can be opened  
by a sliding door.  
On the top floors of the solitary build-  
ing \(Building c\) recessed into the slope,  
the apartments are arranged around one  
of the building’s corners or open to three  
sides and laid out in a similar fashion.  
Between the inserted core and the encom-  
passing walls, a corridor, foyer, kitchen,  
and two living spaces are formed. The  
open corners of the core, created by bun-  
dling two bathrooms and a storage closet,  
help to mark the boundaries of the differ-  
ent areas without inhibiting the open and  
flowing space.  
Within the shorter slab \(Building b\),  
a central corridor leads to studios on one  
side, duplex apartments on the other, and  
once more flats with inserted cores at  
either end.

# APARTMENT TOWER  
# The term apartment tower encompasses both urban  
# high-rises and multi-story residential buildings. In  
# building codes, a high-rise is defi ned as having occu-  
# pied fl oors located above the height reachable by fi re  
# department vehicles; from this height onward, special  
# fi re protection measures and double fi re escape routes  
# must be considered in the design. The apartment  
# tower follows the “law of series,” stacking the highest  
# possible number of identical or similar fl oor plans one  
# above the other. In most cases, the apartments are  
# grouped around a central core with several stair-  
# wells and elevators; due to the size of the core, they  
# are often oriented toward one side only, sometimes  
# around a corner. At times an undulating external skin  
# is employed to provide the apartments with orienta-  
# tion in more than one direction. Apartment towers  
# originated in 19th-century American cities, where real  
# estate markets called for a building type that allowed  
# for a signifi cantly higher ratio of area utilization; this  
# was only made possible through several technologi-  
# cal advancements such as skeleton construction and  
# increased safety features for passenger elevators.  
# Apartment towers are thus a fundamentally urban  
# building form, often furnished with luxurious lobbies  
# reminiscent of those found in hotels because of the  
# great number of occupants. The buildings combine a  
# wide variety of highly different uses\: retail, offi ces and  
# apartments, parking and communal services are often  
# incorporated in a single building for the comfort of the  
# residents. The interiors of the apartment towers tend  
# to be anonymous. With access areas that are often  
# quite small and many residents per fl oor, there is little  
# to inspire neighbourly encounters. Usually, the occu-  
# pant’s principal connection with his city is established  
# by the stunning views afforded by apartments of this  
# kind. From a certain height onward, high-rises become  
# uneconomical and increasingly less sustainable due  
# to the technical, structural, and energy requirements.  
# Due to wind fl ow, the greater the height of the tower,  
# the higher the cost and effort required to provide  
# exterior spaces. Yet precisely these issues – the crea-  
# tion of communal and private outdoor spaces for the  
# residents and an improvement of the energy balance –  
# pose the challenges for the high-rises of the future.  
2.3 Lake Shore Drive |  
# Mies van der Rohe | 1951  
The two apartment towers, the first to be  
realized almost exclusively in glass and  
steel, are placed on the trapezoid lot in such  
a manner that they appear to glide past  
one another and to provide all apartments  
with a panoramic vista of Lake Michigan. A  
roof between the recessed entrance stories  
links the two towers. Although based on an  
identical structural grid, the north tower  
accommodates eight 2-room apartments  
on each floor, and the south tower four  
5-room apartments. The original floor plans  
were loosely based on the “open plan” of  
Farnsworth House. A service core with open  
kitchen and bathroom was to define living,  
dining and bedroom. After the financier  
objected that Americans preferred enclosed  
rooms, the floor plans had to be revised. The  
more conventional floor plan solution with  
separated bedrooms and enclosed kitch-  
ens was ultimately realized. Kitchen and  
bathroom are located at the center in both  
solutions. The other rooms benefit from the  
view.

2 Weberwiese | Henselmann | 1952  
“The first high-rise in the GDR.” The struc-  
ture, realized in brickwork, contains four  
identical units grouped around a central  
stairwell. A generous hallway leads to  
kitchen, bath­ room, closet, and two of the  
three rooms. The latter, projecting from  
the building core, are arranged around the  
corner, with the corner room in the middle  
and lit from two sides. The attractive layout  
and dimensions of each of these rooms  
allows for a free choice of usage. Moreover,  
the non-load-bearing dividing wall sug-  
gests that two of these rooms could easily  
be combined into one. The kitchens open  
towards the auxiliary stairwells \(stipulated  
by the building authorities\) with gar­ bage  
disposal chutes. The building is strongly  
defined by its “classic” image since it was  
intended to “satisfy the need for represen-  
tation of the working people.” On the other  
hand, the surprisingly neutral rooms are  
the reason why these apartments are once  
again in demand today.

# Van den Broek / Bakema | 1958  
By virtue of a clever combination of section  
and plan, the building affords most units  
natural light on two sides and cross ventila-  
tion\: three floors with the access corridor in  
the center and staggered split-level floors  
facing in the opposite direction are com-  
bined to form a greater unit, of which six are  
stacked one above the other in alternating  
fashion. The center corridor provides access  
to 1-room apartments on one side and – via  
split double span stairs – to two 3-room  
apartments on the other side\: each set of  
stairs belongs to one apartment and leads  
up, or down, into the open living areas. The  
bedrooms, which are half a story up or down,  
are situated on the opposite side of the  
building. The apartments are thus continu-  
ous front-to-back over top of the stairs. All  
center corridors benefit from natural light on  
both sides. On the south side they open onto  
two-story loggias with sun and play decks for  
shared use. The six loggias define the south  
facade, which also reveals the staggered  
floor arrangement. The organization of the  
apartments is also reflected in the facade\:  
the living rooms are fronted by room-high  
loggias, while the bedrooms lie behind hori-  
zontal bands of windows. In addition to a  
laundry facility, the attic story also features a  
roof garden suitable as a children’s play area.

Four individual towers are arranged as  
wings around a central access core; bridges  
lead to the apartment towers. Access from  
galle­ ries on the north side \(minimal shad-  
ing\). The core contains generous elevators,  
garbage disposals, landings for drying  
laundry, etc. The core is conceived as a  
kind of rear courtyard, originally envisioned  
with planted greenery. The galleries, each  
with two apartments, remain private. An  
installation zone, with kitchen and bath as  
buffer, is located on the gallery side. The  
apartments open out to south, south-west  
and south-east. With the exception of the  
sixth floor \(bachelor units\), all apartments  
are maison­ ettes, with the central liv­ ing  
room \(small balcony\) and kitchen at bot-  
tom floor; two bedrooms on top floor. The  
outer corners have additional emergency  
exits \(ancillary spaces\).

A visionary complex, the first in the United  
States to combine living, working, and  
leisure. “Marina City“ was to become a  
“city within the city“ that would be alive  
24 hours a day. In addition to two apart-  
ment towers, the development contains  
an office complex, theaters \(cinemas\),  
several restaurants, retail stores, etc., and  
a pier where yachts and boats can dock.  
The apartment towers are a “stacked city“  
themselves\: the first fifteen floors are  
conceived as spiraling ramps and reserved  
for park­ ing, followed by forty apartment  
floors above, wrapped around a central  
core, which houses the lift and buil­ ding  
services. The dynamic segmental plan of  
the 1–3-room apartments leads from the  
narrow entrance hallway past dressing  
room, bathroom and kitchen, straight to  
the glass facades with wide balconies and  
the views they offer.

233 Romeo and Juliet |  
# Scharoun | 1959  
Two buildings on a lot, which enter into an  
inspired spatial dialog with one another.  
“Romeo” – a compact, tall apartment tower  
– occupies the eastern side of the shared  
lot. A central, naturally lit corridor provides  
access to six apartments on each floor.  
“Juliet,” the lower building, on the other  
hand, appears more open and dissolved in  
volume, with its ring-shaped fabric divided  
into irregular steps from 11 to 4 stories.  
Covered walkways provide access to the  
apartments in this building, and are con-  
nected to a central stairwell. Penthouse  
units, so-called “studio” apartments with  
large terraces and cantilevered roofs  
generate a roof landscape. The crystalline,  
fanned-out form, which provides pano-  
ramic views in all directions, is common  
to both buildings. The projecting “teeth”  
in the building skin of “Juliet” increase the  
window surface in the individual rooms.  
Both buildings are strongly oriented to-  
ward the path of the sun\: in “Romeo” all  
living rooms and balconies face south,  
while “Juliet’s” circular plan is interrupted  
on the north side. Both buildings feature  
the same floor plan layout in principle,  
where a central hallway provides direct  
access to all rooms within a unit. There  
is always one room, which is addition-  
ally accessible from the living space, the  
separation of private and common area is  
rendered in a more flowing manner. The  
organic disposition of the internal dividing  
walls, which is also expressed in the fa-  
cade, and the spatial effect of the two large  
fabrics on their own and in relation to each  
other, transforms the “Romeo and Juliet”  
complex into a differentiated housing  
experience. With this complex, Scharoun  
delivered proof in the postwar era that  
efficiency is not necessarily dependant on  
an orthogonal plan.

2.3 Torres Blancas |  
# Sáenz de Oiza | 1969  
The inspiration for this tower \(the original  
plan envisioned two towers, hence the name  
“Torres Blancas,” plural\) was to create a verti-  
cal garden city that grows toward the sky  
like a tree. Cantilevered semicircular terraces  
envelope the building – like leaves on the  
branches of a tree. They provide shelter from  
the sun and noise and are the size of small  
gardens which can be extensively planted. It  
is through this green filter that the interiors  
communicate with the exterior space. The  
organic structure is continued on the inside  
of the units and determines the complex  
spatial construct\: the geometry of the con-  
crete structure, the layout of the access  
zones, as well as the internal organization  
of the apartments. A generous access area  
comprising an atrium, open and enclosed  
stairs, and cylindrical elevators provide ac-  
cess to four i. e. eight apartments per floor.  
The massive support columns with long-  
span ceilings make it possible to stack units  
with very different plans from floor to floor.  
Spacious open living spaces along the ter-  
races are intentionally undefined to provide  
users with the utmost flexibility.  
A two-story common area on the roof,  
which originally accommodated a pool, bar,  
and restaurant, now houses offices.

A complex mixture of spare floors  
plans, combined in a variety of ways.  
Almost every apartment is oriented to-  
ward east and west, either as a single-  
floor apartment perpendicular to the  
access axis or as a maisonette. Only the  
two-room apartments and a few of the  
three-room apartments face only east  
or west. In the case of the maisonettes,  
the top floor is taken up by the living  
room, open kitchen, and dining area;  
the sleeping floor lies below, usually  
extending through the entire building.  
All kitchens are positioned as part of  
the living area along the access axis;  
all baths, WCs, and the double-return  
maisonette stairs also lie in this inner  
area. Access hallways are necessary on  
only two of three floors. The complicat-  
ed arrangement of the apartments is  
also expressed in the facade\: the large  
horizontal living-room windows appear  
on each third floor, with a row of nar-  
row, almost floor-to-ceiling bedroom  
windows and a row of large and small  
windows mixed between them.

2.3 Walden 7 | Bofill | 1975  
Located in a suburb of Barcelona, the  
project is a complex vertical conglomerate  
of 16 aggregated towers laid out in a grid  
around six courtyards. Tower pairs flanking  
the courtyards are not simply vertical,  
but widen alternately at their center or at  
their tops and bottoms. The pairs open  
toward the center around the four larger  
courtyards to form a “window to the city,”  
the gap narrowing again at the top. In the  
central axis, they widen at the base to  
form a “city gate” connecting the open and  
linked courtyards with the surrounding  
neighborhood.  
Bundled together in the central court-  
yards, the elevators form a junction for the  
residential community. Starting at each  
stop, a horizontal circulation network con-  
nects two levels and branches off around  
multiple courtyards, forming a space of  
chance encounters as it leads to the indi-  
vidual apartment entrances.  
The floor plans are based on 30 m²  
modules, which can be combined hori-  
zontally or vertically to form apartments  
with different sizes and various configura-  
tions. The spatial configuration of each  
unit begins with a seemingly schematically  
zoned floor plan\: bathrooms and kitchens  
are placed along the dividing wall between  
apartments, with the living spaces lined up  
on the opposite facade wall. A double-sid-  
ed closet wall in between acts more like an  
interface than a boundary. The separation  
dissipates again and again. For instance,  
the bathtub opens up to the living room  
while one side of the dining table is in the  
kitchen and the other in the living room.  
The vision of living – as illustrated in the  
perspective sketches – focuses completely  
on a horizontal plane; to one side of the  
closet wall, a living landscape of seating  
and sleeping accommodations is sunk into  
the floor, devoid of any other furniture.

2.3 Kanchanjunga Apartments |  
# Correa | 1983  
The apartment tower opens in two direc-  
tions to benefit from fresh breezes from  
the sea to the west and the harbor to the  
east. However, these orientations also ex-  
pose the apartments to the hot afternoon  
sun and the monsoon rains. The tower is  
therefore wrapped in a protective layer of  
terraces; they are cut out from the volume  
at the corners and offer each apartment  
an exterior space on an urbane scale.  
Moreover, the position of the “cut-outs”  
alternates from floor to floor, thus defining  
the sculptural appearance of the tower. All  
32 apartments occupy the entire depth of  
the volume and are wrapped around the  
central circulation core on three sides. All  
the large units occupy two stories, while  
the remaining apartments are single-story  
in the interior and only reach across two  
stories in the terrace area. All units are  
organized into split-levels, which facilitate  
uninterrupted sightlines throughout the  
interior. The differing apartment types are  
interlaced within the staggered levels that  
result from these split-levels.  
In the largest units, the entrance area  
leads directly into a generous L-shaped  
living room wrapped around the dou-  
ble-height terrace. The stairs connect the  
living room to the individual rooms above  
and also to both levels behind the opposite  
facade. The bathrooms and bedroom  
loggias at the facade level form a buffer to  
the outside. There is also a two-story space  
in the interior. With its formal analogy to  
the terraces, this space seems to question  
its own placement within the interior – the  
entire construct appears as a light, open  
web of levels, connections, and spatial  
relationships, that run through the building  
and penetrate boundaries.

The open entrance hall with access ele-  
ments, galleries, and bridges forms the  
spine of the building. The terraces at both  
ends serve simultaneously as entrances to  
the apartments. This open area, at once  
terrace, entryway, and part of the hall,  
is the distinctive feature of this housing  
strategy. The ground floor and second  
floor, that is, the area of the two-story  
lobby, contain maisonettes on both sides  
that can be entered from the ground  
floor. On the upper floors, a central gallery  
along the longitudinal axis of the building  
plays a distributing role; this gallery gives  
way to two open terraces on both sides,  
forming this intermediate zone in front  
of the apartments. As a result, there are a  
wide variety of unobstructed views into all  
levels\: clear space around the staircase, the  
elevator, the gallery. The apartments are  
organized on a classic pattern; installation  
zone on the inner side with bath, closet  
area, WC, kitchen. The kitchen is part of the  
living room and has a window to the inter-  
mediate zone in front of the apartment. All  
rooms are fronted by narrow terraces \(wide  
terraces in front of the penthouses\).

The development is a part of Beijing’s  
new central business district east of  
Tiananmen Square and consists of an  
ensemble of nine residential high-rises  
and four mid-sized office buildings. The  
buildings and the open access grid are  
rotated 25 degrees to the surrounding  
city blocks, opening up the ensemble  
to increased sunlight and a view of the  
Tonghui River. A system of pedestrian  
walkways on multiple levels connects  
the buildings with sunken public cultural  
and green spaces. Together with the  
mixed-use areas – housing, restaurants  
and cafes, offices, and other commercial  
areas – the network of walkways makes a  
significant contribution to the density and  
urban livelihood of the development.  
The square footprints of the high-rises  
contain various floor plan types, all of  
which have one similarity\: they combine  
living and working areas within one unit.  
All apartments incorporate a so-called  
SOHO-zone \(“Small Office/Home Office”\)  
and wide entrances along the spacious  
central corridor, and share in part multi-  
storied spaces which can be used private-  
ly or commercially. In the l type tower,  
three apartments naturally lit from two  
sides meet in the center. Inserted cores  
incorporating storage spaces, bathrooms,  
and kitchens as well as private corner  
rooms generate open living spaces with  
multiple zones, with the more public  
SOHO zone at the front and the more  
private rooms towards the rear along the  
facade. In the ms building type, a central  
corridor runs the length of the building,  
from which the SOHO areas of each apart-  
ment and the living spaces beyond branch  
off toward the facade.

2.3 Mirador | MVRDV/  
# Blanca Lleó | 2005  
In an urban expansion area originally  
zoned for horizontal block developments,  
this typology is translated into the vertical\:  
the result is a high-rise on an urban scale.  
The enclosed courtyard is transformed into  
an open communal garden at a height of  
40 m, a framework for the ever-changing  
urban landscape. In deliberate contrast  
to the standard rows of identical apart-  
ment typologies, nine houses are stacked  
within each other in the Mirador complex,  
increasing density and each with their  
own apartment types. Connected by a  
complex, vertical and horizontal circulation  
and access sytem, they form a “superblock.”  
Up to the 10th floor, the building  
features single-level front-to-back and  
corner units. The subsequent levels are  
reserved nearly exclusively for multi-story  
\(2 to 3 stories\) maisonette apartments. In  
and of themselves, the floor plans are not  
the unique characteristic of this building,  
rather it is the combination of these plans  
and the manner in which apartments  
and access are interwoven, and the fact  
that they are always oriented toward the  
communal areas – the loggias inserted  
into the corner, the large courtyard “in  
the sky” at the center and the projecting  
stairwells. The central corridors leading to  
the maisonettes are also integrated into  
this complex spatial layout. On the 19th  
and 20th floors, they are part of an open,  
multi­ -story atrium across the entire length  
of the building. From the upper maison-  
ettes, external stairs bisect the atrium to  
the private roof patios.

2.3 Boutique Monaco – Missing Matrix |  
# Mass Studies | 2008  
The four-story base of the C-shaped high-  
rise is reserved for cultural, commercial,  
and community uses; the 23 stories above  
are a complex structure housing 172 apart-  
ments of 49 different types, all accessed  
from the inner side of the two wings of  
the C-shaped plan. However, built to the  
maximum allowable height of 100 m,  
the skyscraper would have exceeded the  
permitted density by 10 percent, a problem  
that is solved with the so-called “miss-  
ing matrices.” These are voids cut out of  
the tower. They not only define the ap-  
pearance of the tower, but also generate  
typologically surprising floor plans. The  
15 voids augment the total facade surface  
and provide additional natural light and a  
better view for the apartments. This design  
also results in units that are open on three  
sides, with floor plans that are wrapped  
around and organized on either side of  
these voids. These units also benefit from  
having generous open spaces, in part  
planted with trees\: in some two-story units  
the balcony reaches from one facade to  
the other and the only connection between  
the interior levels is a staircase volume  
projecting into the void; there are apart-  
ments in which the rooms are connected  
via a bridge, or corner units with generous  
terrace gardens, which divide the floor plan  
into private and common areas.

This high-rise building incorporates a  
former manufacturing facility into its base.  
With its scale and character, the base cre-  
ates a visual connection to the surrounding  
production facilities. It is now used to house  
a rehearsal stage. While the tower rises  
vertically on the street side, on the opposite  
side it begins to taper above the roofline of  
the neighboring city blocks to create slightly  
terraced levels on its upper portion. Facing  
south, these floor-to-ceiling glazed loggias  
offer residents a panoramic view of the city  
center and Lake Zurich.  
The floor plan organization and spatial  
quality of the residential levels is charac-  
terized by a structural system of parallel  
shear walls seemingly extending into the  
generous loggias on the terraced side of  
the building. Depending on the location,  
this spatial system generates a variety of  
apartment types and sizes. Along the side  
facades, the units \(a\) extend from one side  
of the building to the other and continue  
into the adjacent segment at the back of  
the building where the entrance, bedrooms,  
and bathrooms are located. The units in the  
center \(b\) of the building connect multiple  
segments with a deep living room bordered  
at the back by a kitchen and hallway and on  
the sides by more private areas. On the up-  
b  
per floors where the building depth begins  
to recede, three segments are combined,  
while on the lower floors, two duplex units  
are situated next to one another \(c\). Their  
lower level runs the length of the building,  
while on the floor above where the entrance  
is located, they extend only through the  
rear portion. Single-floor apartments run-  
ning perpendicular through three structural  
segments \(d\) occupy the front portion of the  
floor above the duplexes’ lower level.

2.3 Kent Vale | MKPL | 2014  
A high and spacious colonnade flanked  
by a parallel building with communal  
facilities forms the communal backbone  
for three residential towers positioned  
in a staggered row. The colonnade con-  
nects the towers with the entrance road  
and the surrounding university campus.  
From the colonnade, three two-level  
walkways branch off, framing patchwork-  
like arranged gardens and leading on the  
lower level to the multi-story portico-like  
entrance foyer. Their upper level connects  
the towers to shared amenities such as  
a swimming pool and playground on the  
roof of the parallel building. These com-  
munal spaces are complemented in the  
towers by roof gardens and large cantile-  
vered balconies on every 8th floor.  
Deep incisions into the building vol-  
umes, open access areas, and an exterior  
envelope with plant trellises and shading  
elements form an H-shaped cluster floor  
plan. The resulting open, multi-layered  
structure is green on all sides, naturally  
ventilated, and adequately shaded to  
facilitate a tropical lifestyle.  
The apartments on the north side are  
laid out with an efficient floor plan subtly  
organized into three tiers. The sleeping  
quarters are directed to the north, while  
an open living room is located near the  
entrance. Three adjoining niches here  
form the hallway, kitchen, and dining  
area, and a deeply drawn-in loggia to  
the east or west can be connected with  
the apartment interior by opening fold-  
ing doors. On the building’s south side,  
an almost identical floor plan is treated  
slightly differently in the unit’s first tier.  
Here, the living area is arranged in such  
a way to potentially allow the division  
of what would otherwise be a 5-room  
apartment into a 2- and a 3-room unit  
with separate entrances. The units can be  
easily connected to one another at will.  
In this manner, the often unpredictable  
needs of changing faculty members and  
their families can be taken into account.

# TERRACED COMPLEX  
# The terraced complex is tantamount to a built uto-  
# pia because it appears to interweave landscape and  
# architecture, natural and built space, and aims to  
# multiply the number of open, often verdant spaces.  
# This typology is characterized by the design of the  
# threshold between interior and exterior, by terraces as  
# open spaces and topography. The occupants benefit  
# from the direct relationship with the generous exterior  
# spaces. The terraced complex is located either on a  
# natural slope with orientation into one direction and  
# a building and access configuration that follows the  
# topo­ g­ raphy of the site. Alternatively, the complex  
# can itself create an artificial topography with special  
# functions located in the core areas, where natural light  
# cannot penetrate. These functions may include access  
# zones, storage areas, garage – and even a highway.  
# Owing to their horizontality and complex staggering,  
# terraced complexes are barely discernible as clearly  
# circum­ scribable, sculptural building volumes; rather,  
# they have the appearance of a structure that could oc-  
# cupy entire landscapes. However, this building type is  
# economically and technically very demanding.  
2.4 Habitat 67 | Safdie | 1967  
Sculptural experimental housing project on  
the shores of the St. Lawrence River con-  
ceived on the occasion of the 1967 EXPO in  
Montreal. The conglomerate consist of 354  
prefabricated, elongated concrete modules  
– each 55 m² in size – which were stacked  
in a staggered, orthogonal arrangement.  
The apartments can be composed of one  
or several modules\: a total of 16 different  
configurations were realized. The rotation  
of the modules ensures that the rooms  
are oriented in different directions. One  
module generally accommodates a living  
room with kitchen and the internal stairs,  
and another one to two modules provide  
space for bedrooms and bathrooms. Each  
of the 1–5-room apartments is allocated to  
at least one large terrace on the roof of the  
unit below. The apartments are reached  
horizontally via covered pedestrian roads  
on every fourth level, and vertically via  
three lift cores. Short flights of stairs lead  
to the apartment above or below the  
corridor. All sections, play streets, prefab-  
ricated modules, and lift cores are linked  
in a manner that contributes to the overall  
structural support of the entire complex.  
Only 158 of a projected 1000 units were  
realized, making the project relatively  
expensive and ultimately preventing the  
development of the planned infrastructure  
with offices and retail stores to the full  
extent, which had been envisioned. Given  
the rigorous dedication to providing each  
unit with light, sunshine, and a generous  
terrace, Habitat 67 has no more density  
than a row-house development. It contin-  
ues to function as a housing development  
to this day, having been bought by the  
tenants, who also assume the building  
management.

Artificial residential hill, symmetrically  
oriented toward east and west. The depth of  
the two lower floors allows apartments only  
in one point of the compass. Through living  
spaces on third and fourth floors. On the  
ground floor, the depth of the house is used  
by a central storage-room zone that runs  
all the way through. Within the fixed axial  
intervals and installation cores is a variety  
of apartments, with L-, U-, and T-shaped  
floor plans. This transforms the terraces \(of  
different sizes\) into inner courts enclosed  
on three sides. Clear zoning of living and  
sleeping areas. Large terrace in front of living  
room, often small ones in front of sleeping

A typical London street block is given a new  
interpretation. The basic approach\: terraced  
apartments on both sides, gallery access in  
the hill interior and a grandiose five-story  
atrium. The apartments have simple layouts\:  
the sanitary elements are placed along the  
gallery with the individual rooms lined up  
after them \(the different apartment sizes  
result from adding up these rooms\). The  
partition between kitchen and living room is  
designed as a counter. All living rooms end  
in a vertical and slanting winter garden sec-  
tion, entirely glassed-in; next to it a terrace  
with access from all rooms. Beneath the  
paved inner courtyard\: neighbourhood uses  
\(shops, restaurants, cinema\).

The housing complex contains two dif-  
ferent building types, of which the apart-  
ments in the terrace houses are shown  
here \(the three-story row houses appear  
only in the site plan\). The typical terrace  
houses on angular floor plans are stacked  
on top of each other in strips of four to  
seven housing units. The intermediate  
zones between the development strips  
alternately contain either access paths –  
angular open stairways and landings filled  
with flower­ beds – or a second garden/  
service courtyard belonging to each apart-  
ment. The entrance to the apartment is  
set back \(covered\); the anteroom leads on  
one side to the small dining area, which, as  
an intermediate zone, provides access to  
living room and bedroom hallway, and on  
the other side to the large cellars, hobby  
rooms, and utility rooms excavated from  
the slope. The terrace on the southern  
side is enclosed by a deep plant trough  
that blocks the view into the apartment  
below. All rooms, including the dining area,  
have exits to the terrace. The small ser­ vice  
courtyard lights either the spacious bath at  
the end of the hallway \(with door to out-  
side\), the study, or one of the bedrooms.

# Heinrichs | 1982  
Built on top of an S-shaped double tun-  
nel as part of one of the loop highways in  
Berlin\: a 500-m-long, terraced residential  
development. A total of around 120 dif-  
ferent apartment types were created\:  
minimum-size flats, terraced apartments,  
standardized apartments, maisonettes.  
Generally the apartments are oriented to  
only one point of the compass, east or  
west; however, slanted glass doors toward  
oriels and terraces admit southeast or  
southwest light. In the minimum-size  
apartments, the kitchens are part of the  
living area \(can be separated off by sliding  
doors\) or are reduced to kitchen counters.  
Despite standard measurement of 6.10 m  
bay width, a wide variety of room layouts  
are offered. The great depth of the terraced  
apartments is exploited by inserted kitch-  
ens and closets; the slanted folding walls  
to the bedrooms create a greater sense  
of width. All ­ larger apartments separate  
bath and WC; the bath, as a rule, is directly  
accessible from the bedroom; the second  
path leads back to the lobby. Large ter-  
races and loggias supplement the housing  
strategy. On the fifth floor, an internal  
street with several community rooms\:  
hobby rooms, playrooms, etc. Guest apart-  
ments on the third floor. On ground floor\:  
laundries, bike rooms, etc.

2.4 Living at the Lake |  
# Baumschlager Eberle | 1988  
The terraced development on a slope  
is located between Lake Constance and  
the Bregenz Forest, although the site  
is separated from the lakeshore by a  
much-traveled road and a railway line.  
The configuration of the plinth story,  
which houses retail stores, commercial  
spaces, and the underground garage,  
ensures that the apartments on the  
upper levels lie above the acoustical  
shadow of the road. The atria at ground  
level, which provide access to the com-  
mercial units, continue on the upper  
floors as planted open spaces. The ter-  
raced building sections contain duplex  
and triplex apartments, staggered so  
that each apartment features a gener-  
ous terrace with a splendid view of  
Lake Constance. With the exception of  
two small apartments in the rear sec-  
tion of the building, all living areas with  
kitchen open onto these terraces, while  
the bedrooms underneath overlook the  
elongated courtyards. Principal access  
is provided via glass-covered, cascading  
stairs with landings in front of sets of  
two apartments. The comb-like struc-  
ture achieves a differentiated sequence  
of public \(green spaces\), semiprivate  
\(pergolas\) and private exterior spaces  
\(terraces\). The corner of the complex  
facing toward the city is marked by a  
4-story office building, next to which  
the entrance ramp to the underground  
garage is located. The ingeniously  
stacked and staggered apartments cre-  
ate a typological variety that succeeds  
in bridging the gap between row-house  
development and dense low buildings.

2.4 The Mountain |  
# BIG Bjarke Ingels Group | 2008  
3  
The program for “The Mountain” is sum-  
marized as two thirds parking and one  
third living\: a 10-story parking garage  
serves as the base for a terraced hous-  
ing development draped across the top  
like a patchwork quilt of gardens, patios,  
and apartments. The approach is one of  
combining the comforts of suburban living  
with the social intensity of urban density  
– residents drive almost to their front door  
and enter their apartment which affords  
them an expansive panoramic view across  
single-family homes nestled in a verdant  
suburban environment. A ramp with a  
sloping elevator and stairs placed between  
the parking and apartment decks, as well  
as bridges spanning the cascading atrium  
between the two layers, connect to the ac-  
cess corridors that lead to the apartments.  
In the interior, hallways, bathrooms, and  
walk-in closets create a transitional zone to  
the living room, which has an entirely dif-  
ferent spatial sense with generous glazing  
affording a view onto the urban panorama  
to the southeast. The basic layout of the  
living room is L-shaped, wrapped around  
the deep roof patio, connected with lane-  
like gardens above the apartment on the  
terrace below. Wood-encased planters  
serve as balustrades and privacy screens.  
More complex units – some small and  
others larger, some two-stories high and  
others with two patios – are located along  
the edges of the complex, where the uni-  
form terracing merges with the shape of  
the parcel. On the north and west facades,  
the walls of the parking decks are clad in  
perforated aluminum plates bearing an  
image of Mount Everest.

# RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX /  
# HOUSING ESTATE  
# This category is very heterogeneous\: it covers single-  
# family row houses in either linear or courtyard forma-  
# tions, multi-story conglomerates with interlaced and  
# stacked apartment components, the meandering,  
# space-enclosing “sculptures” of large-scale develop-  
# ments from the 1960s and 1970s, inner-city and sub-  
# urban building ensembles, and even that autonomous  
# urban building block – the housing estate.  
# Residential complexes and estates are structurally  
# self-contained islands within the urban configuration  
# and sufficient unto themselves. With the exception of  
# large-scale developments, despite their density, they  
# aim to fulfill the desire for a place of one’s own\: hence,  
# efforts are undertaken to provide each occupant with  
# their own access space, be it at ground level or on  
# one of the upper floors. Similarly, the transition from  
# public to private areas, and from public to private  
# green is usually designed in a highly differentiated and  
# varied manner. Clear boundaries to the surroundings,  
# the often compact and homogeneous construction,  
# common open spaces, and the deliberate restriction  
# to a limited number of floor plan and house typologies  
# – albeit often with subtle differences – contribute to  
# the establishment of a shared identity among all oc-  
# cupants. In extreme cases, estates can become gated  
# communities, which define themselves as communi-  
# ties for members of a uniform social class, usually  
# affluent, and distance themselves from the outside  
# world through security guards and barrier installa-  
# tions. By virtue of their scale, estates and residential  
# complexes can contribute to stabilizing urban agglom-  
# erations and transition areas, giving them an identity  
# and stimulus for further densification.  
2.5 Märkisches Viertel |  
# Fleig | 1966  
In response to the north-south orientation  
of the entire development, the architect  
developed a complex floor plan that allows  
for south-facing living rooms and balco-  
nies in all apartments. Kitchen and dining  
area are set diagonally to the eastern i.e.  
western exposure. The floor plans create a  
clear division between communal and indi-  
vidual areas\: the sanitary block consisting  
of bathroom, WC, and kitchen was placed  
in the middle of the apartment space and  
thus creates two paths, one leading di-  
rectly into the living room, the other to the  
sleeping area. In the two-room apartments  
the path becomes a circular path that  
leads via kitchen and dining area back into  
the living room; in the larger apartments  
the sleeping area can be separated off. All  
dining areas \(but also other rooms\) have  
corner windows.

The complex stacks identical spatial ele-  
ments on top of each other. The stairwell is  
surrounded by auto­ nomous units compris-  
ing hallways, guest WCs, kitchens, and stor-  
age rooms. The bedrooms and bathrooms  
form sleeping tracts of various lengths  
\(depending on apartment size\). From the  
outside they appear as bedroom towers.  
The positions of the kitchen towers and  
sleeping towers result in ­ L-shaped living  
rooms lit from two sides and two loggias.  
The kitchen opens into the living room but  
can also be reached directly from the entry  
hallway. The floor plan is distinguishable  
from the outside. The last two floors are  
occupied by maison­ ettes composed of two  
superimposed sleeping tracts; the living-  
room space becomes a rooftop terrace.

# Darbourne and Darke | 1977  
An introverted dense housing complex  
with row houses staggered in height. The  
larger apartments are accessed via court-  
yards, the smaller ones from the upper  
access path that runs through the center  
of the development. This path across the  
roofs serves as an open-air recreational  
area for residents. Transverse housing  
blocks divide these areas into easily iden-  
tifiable sections. Between the house rows  
are residential paths and courtyards; the  
taller buildings provide noise protection  
along the street elevation. The apartments  
are mainly vertical in organization; the  
lower maisonettes have two to three floors  
following the “back-to-back crossover”  
scheme, i.e. the apartments are organized  
back to back, but the compass points are  
switched on the following floor so that  
each apartment and its living area profit  
from the more favourable direction. Access  
to the maisonettes is provided through the  
private green spaces in front; kitchen/din-  
ing, living, and sleeping are accommodated  
on separate levels. The third floor contains  
the pedestrian deck \(footpath\), to which  
the two-story maisonettes and/or flats are  
attached. Individual rooms can be assigned  
to various apartments; this provides addi-  
tional flexibility in apartment sizes.

Despite the great urban density, most of  
the units in the Maiden Lane Estate feature  
individual entrances located at ground  
level or along the raised access roads,  
sheltered private open spaces and fairly  
generous, always deep floor plans lit from  
two sides, although the grid is only 4 m  
wide. The architects followed the model  
of the Halen development designed by the  
architects from Atelier 5 \(see page 298\).  
Similar to that model, the terraced site is  
utilized and manipulated to create differ-  
ent access levels for the pedestrian routes,  
to shift parking traffic onto another level  
and to endow the housing units with a  
high degree of privacy. To this end, similar  
row-house types, flats, and stacked mai-  
sonettes are linked in a specifically urban  
manner. The narrow row-house units  
\(building b\) are accessed via a courtyard-  
like and sheltered front garden. The bed-  
rooms are located on this ground level and  
both are directly linked to a private open  
space of their own\: the bedroom at the  
rear overlooks a patio, which is connected  
to the very large terrace on the upper  
floor via a steep set of stairs. Upstairs, the  
internal stairs and the kitchen/dining area  
face towards this open space, while the liv-  
ing room overlooks the entrance courtyard.  
The 2- to 3-story maisonettes adhere to  
the basic layout of these apartment units.  
The 2-room flats complete the buildings;  
they have balconies on both sides and an  
L-shaped kitchen, inviting front-to-back  
living despite the narrow hallway.

Apartments around two courtyards. Four  
row houses \(three stories in N and W,  
four stories in E and S\) make up one side  
of a courtyard; the square corner build-  
ings, as joints, have five stories. Inside  
the courtyards\: circulation, businesses,  
public outside space, communal institu-  
tions \(laundry, club room\). In outside ring,  
private greenery. The row houses consist of  
two floor plan types developing vertically  
or horizontally; a four-room maisonette  
over two or three levels \(inside a bay\) and a  
four-room apartment on the roof \(over two  
bays\). The corner buildings are double- or  
triple-loaded with one-, two-, or three-  
room apartments on one or two levels. All  
building types vary the same floor plan  
idea. Row houses\: height differences be-  
tween court level and entry level separate  
the public space \(courtyard\) from semi-  
public \(entry platform, terrace\) and private  
spaces. The stairway can be semipublic or  
private, inside or outside. The apartments  
are always accessed via the kitchen/din-  
ing area separated from the living area by  
the WC, cabinet, and inside stairway. From  
this level, access to garden \(via stairway\)  
or terrace. Above are three to four bed-  
rooms, spatially separated by bath, walk-in  
closet, and stairway. Extra studios in the  
basement stories are assigned to some  
apartments. Three-room apartments on  
the roof\: they are accessed from the corner  
buildings and distribute living and sleep-  
ing areas horizontally to one bay each. The  
corner houses mix all types.

The development forms four blocks,  
two on each side of a main path.  
The floor plans are extremely  
simple and clear. The southern  
wings contain mainly three-story  
maisonettes placed in a row like  
single-family houses. Kitchens,  
baths, stairwells, expanded corridor  
zones face north; all rooms open  
to the south. Small greenspaces lie  
behind a gravel path. The function  
of the living room on the ground  
floor is fixed by its proximity to the  
kitchen and its size; all other rooms  
are equal. On the third floor a gal-  
lery runs in front of the apartments  
on the north side. Above the two-  
story maisonettes, there is either  
a two-room apartment following  
the same floor plan scheme, or the  
building axis is cut up into two one-  
room studios that can be optionally  
connected. The apartments in the  
wings have east-west orientation;  
on the east or west sides \(the floor  
plans are mirrored along the main  
axis\) lie corridors with belt windows  
behind a zone with sanitary areas.  
The corridor, wide enough to work  
in, makes the rooms appear like  
display compartments. It leads into  
the living room with inserted open  
kitchen. A large terrace is located,  
orthogonal to the building axis, in  
front of the living room on each  
floor; this three-story terrace row  
closes the block to the north.

2.5 Wienerberggründe |  
# Steidle + Partner | 1993  
The two housing projects “Wien-Süd” and  
“Wien-Privat” were constructed following  
an urban plan by Otto Häuselmayer.  
Together they densify the double-row  
building type by weaving in perpendicular  
bars, creating courtyards within.  
“Wien-Süd”\: the living rooms and bed-  
rooms are located in the main structures,  
while the cross rows hold stairwells  
and the apartments’ ancillary functions.  
Passage­ ways connect the courtyards  
through openings in the rows. At these  
openings are the long stairwells in which  
the stairs take a new direction on every  
floor. The apartments are oriented towards  
two sides\: outwards to the garden and  
inwards to the courtyard. Most interesting  
are the corner units, which bend around  
and thus permit a visual relationship  
between one end of the apartment and the  
other. The entrance leads directly to the  
“elbow” \(which has French windows\) where  
living and bedrooms are to one side, while  
kitchen, bath, toilet, and sometimes a sec-  
ond bedroom lie along a broad corridor to  
the other side. On the 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th  
floor, maisonettes are tucked in between  
corner apartments. On the 5th/6th floor,  
the corner apartment becomes itself a  
maisonette. Where the living room was,  
one finds the stairs and three bedrooms.  
A bath, toilet, and large bedroom run  
along the corridor. Upstairs a long space  
is divided by the stairs, creating a kitchen/  
dining area and a living room.

2.5 Kilchberg |  
# Gigon / Guyer | 1996  
The first housing island, called “Kilchberg,”  
is located in the park of a former estate.  
The architects were able to change the  
original plan for developing the entire  
open space with single-family homes into  
targeted densification with a total of six  
housing islands. The stunning vista of Lake  
Zurich and the Alps combined with prox-  
imity to the city suggested that this would  
be an ideal site for upscale apartments.  
The Housing Island I is introverted in  
nature. Three simple buildings are grouped  
around an interior courtyard. Two of the  
volumes contain flats, one is composed  
of row houses. The plinth story that con-  
nects the building houses contains parking  
places with direct access to the buildings.  
Above this level\: the artificial courtyard  
with building entrances. In addition to pav-  
ing and trees, the courtyard space is above  
all divided by gazebos constructed from  
boarding, which provide a semiprivate  
outside seating area for each house. The  
generous floor plans are oriented towards  
three directions. The rooms are ar­ ranged  
around a core with two bathrooms, which  
acts as a shield in front of the bedrooms.  
Kitchen and dining area overlook the  
courtyard, while private rooms and living  
room fronted by a winter garden benefit  
from a view of the park. The room propor-  
tions in combination with the sliding doors  
give the floor plan a strong character of  
flexibility. Across the facade, the floor-to-  
ceiling windows are distributed in such a  
free manner that even identical floor plans  
present an individual and different face  
on the outside. Thus, the window arrange-  
ment echoes the arrangement, on a larger  
scale, of the housing islands, which are  
scattered across the park like pavilions.

2.5 Rockpool | Popov | 1999  
The development on the edge of Sydney  
in an area dominated by beach villas  
and characterized by a certain density, is  
distinguished by a balance between privacy  
and openness. The development consists  
of two rows\: the front row features flats,  
the one to the rear maisonettes and row  
houses. A private path for the development  
runs between the rows debouching at the  
center of the complex into a communal  
square with pine trees. The individual  
units within the rows are set off from each  
other. This responds to the site and also  
creates a differentiated elevation in which  
each unit is specific in character. Each unit  
has balconies and generous terraces, those  
in the front row offering spectacular ocean  
views. The arrangement of the units within  
the overall structure of the complex varies  
while adhering to a principal idea\: they are  
always divided into two stacked ­ levels or  
two adjacent axial fields. The functions of  
living/sleeping are thus separated from  
one another; they are either accommodat-  
ed one above the other, side by side or se-  
quentially. The kitchens are set freely into  
the space or framed by short walls. Each  
unit has a study/guest room, equipped  
with folding doors and visu­ ally linked to  
the generous living room. This room is  
often shifted away from the main axis, tall  
and narrow glass louvers fill the resulting  
gap and light the space. The development  
is characterized by a playful treatment  
of filling the structure \(diaphragm walls,  
framework with segmental arches\), the  
resulting rhythm, and the deviation from  
this rhythm.

2.5 Balance Uster |  
# Haerle Hubacher | 2001  
The residential concept “Balance” has been  
realized on three different sites in the  
Zurich conurbation and was initially con-  
ceived as an answer to the phenomenon  
of increasingly changing and diverse living  
situations, as well as the desire of resi-  
dents to take part in the design process for  
their own habitat. The basis of the design  
is a highly flexible floor plan covering an  
entire floor. Varied use and potential inte-  
rior divisions were achieved by the precise  
placement of two spatial elements – a core  
containing the bathrooms and offering  
two potential niches for the kitchen unit or  
storage space and an open closet wall in  
the private areas. This closet wall defines a  
hallway on one side, while on the opposite  
side the individual segments enable the  
flexible configuration of room constel-  
lations and placement of access points.  
Taken together, they form a generous and  
divisible entrance area followed by two  
open living spaces with a zone at the back  
for individual rooms.  
Fully glazed on all sides, each floor  
is surrounded by a wraparound balcony,  
meaning the residents can walk around  
their entire apartment as if it were a  
single-family home. This balcony deepens  
toward the southwest to form a wide log-  
gia bay which is split by the vertical access  
core into two parts to enable the creation  
of an additional entrance should the floor  
be divided into two units.  
By freely interpreting the spaces  
through the insertion of new walls to di-  
vide rooms or apartments, a variety of floor  
plan constellations are possible, which can  
be easily altered. In essence, all individual  
choices can be taken into account, with  
the exception of those affecting the load-  
bearing structure, the building envelope  
or the access and sanitary cores. In order  
to guarantee the success of this flexible  
concept, each floor was sold in its entirety.

2.5 Steinfelsareal |  
# Herczog Hubeli | 2002  
The “Steinfelsareal“ is located in Zurich’s  
former industrial district, where conver-  
sions have already created a strong mix of  
living and commercial uses. The existing  
mix was augmented to an even greater  
degree in the new complex by not only  
stacking the different uses but also creat-  
ing many different, interchangeable floor  
plans. These floor plans are therefore  
capable of responding to shifts in demand  
for certain uses and make it possible to  
avoid vacant units. The ensemble is com-  
posed of very different building types\: at  
the center, two rows of point blocks are  
grouped around an inner courtyard, which  
is sheltered by two rows that enclose it,  
the east row and the “basilica.“ The latter  
is a double row with a 5-story access hall  
in the middle, which can be reassigned  
to new uses according to the occupants’  
wishes. Depending on their orientation,  
these rows contain a variety of floor plans.  
In lieu of a roof, they are topped by the  
“cloud-hanger,“ a three-story, 165-m-long  
slab, which is cantilevered in a spectacular  
fashion over top of the existing Cinemax  
theater on the street side. Commercial and  
living spaces are arranged side by side – in  
the cloud-hanger, residential maisonettes  
are strung along commercial units that are  
twice as wide – or stacked one above the  
other\: all plinth stories are used as 2-story  
commercial spaces with galleries, allowing  
for a wide variety of uses by virtue of their  
size and height. In some cases, flexibility  
of use is achieved through a free disposi-  
tion of walls within the framework of the  
structural system, for example, on the  
north side of the basilica, where division  
forms a living or office unit as required. In  
other cases, the floor plans are reduced  
both in form and disposition to allow for  
residential or studio uses, for example, in  
the cloud-hanger.

# Architecture Workshop | 2006  
On a larger building lot, the building mass  
is dissolved into a series of compact  
volumes to provide better light and air  
flow and a scale more in line with the  
proportions of surrounding buildings.  
Each level in this connected chain of  
volumes is divided by a load-bearing wall  
running alternatingly length- or crosswise  
through its middle, thus dividing each  
floor into two halves. These floor halves  
are either connected to one another by  
bridges in the space between the volumes  
or separated by the vertical access cores  
placed here.  
The different orientations of the vol-  
umes and connections between them are  
combined to generate different floor plan  
types. Studio apartments occupy one half  
of a floor. In type a, ground floor studios  
are located in the crosswise divided vol-  
umes and oriented towards the courtyard.  
Type b consists of a floor half divided lon-  
gitudinally plus half of an outdoor bridge  
space. The somewhat larger units type c  
occupy an entire floor where one half  
contains the bedroom and auxiliary rooms  
such as the bathroom and kitchen, while  
the other remains a completely open living  
room. The largest unit type d is accessed  
via an open divisible living room \(with  
the exception of the street-facing unit\)  
in the longitudinally divided volume. It  
is connected by the bridge to a bedroom  
and bathroom in the adjacent, crosswise  
divided volume.  
Near the transparent edges of the vol-  
umes, slender columns support the levels,  
enabling a visual connection between the  
apartment interior and the outdoor space  
beyond. A zone emerging between the  
columns and the glass facade can be used  
as an outlying access hallway between  
the different rooms of a single unit, or to  
slightly expand the size of the spaces.

2.5 Hunziker Areal Building A |  
# Duplex Architekten | 2014  
Instead of a typical residential develop-  
ment, a true urban district was the guiding  
principle for the design of this estate  
– dense, lively, and a place where public,  
communal, and commercial zones can in-  
termingle with private spaces and residen-  
tial units. Participatory dialogues between  
members of the building cooperative and  
the architectural offices involved resulted  
in an ensemble of 13 buildings with diverse  
living forms and floor plan constellations  
derived to help establish a heterogeneous  
community.  
In Building a, each floor is divided into  
two large co-housing units containing five  
to six inserted small apartments as well  
as shared living spaces. The composition  
of the floor plan is strikingly similar to the  
urban layout of the entire ensemble\: open  
spaces are framed by building volumes in  
such a way that they flow into one an-  
other. The living spaces flow between the  
chamber-like small apartments, offering  
plentiful space to cook, eat, and live to-  
gether; they provide a visual connection to  
the circulation space in the central atrium,  
and open up to the facade on all sides in  
the form of quiet niches.  
The chambers provide a quiet and  
private refuge for the residents. More  
than mere bedrooms, they can function  
as small, autonomous residential units.  
Each has its own bathroom, and some an  
additional living room, kitchen unit, or  
second bedroom, making it possible for  
smaller families to live together with oth-  
ers. An enclosed room group situated near  
the entrance houses a wardrobe, guest  
bathroom, and a storage and housekeep-  
ing room. Offices and studio spaces on the  
ground floor are almost identically config-  
ured, illustrating the neutrality and flexible  
potential of the floor plan composition.

# LOW RISE HIGH DENSITY  
# This building type evolved from criticism of the over-  
# development of the landscape due to the construction  
# of detached single-family homes. Partially inspired  
# by vernacular courtyard typologies from North Africa  
# – among other places – low rise high density develop-  
# ments achieve higher density not through increased  
# height, but by reducing the unbuilt surface area to a  
# minimum. Each resident is thus provided with spa-  
# cious, private outdoor areas despite the overall hori-  
# zontal density as well as direct, mostly ground-level  
# entrances from the public sphere.  
# Following a specifically developed compositional  
# logic, repetitive, sometimes varied building modules  
# are grouped to create pattern-like configurations – for  
# the most part with no dominant hierarchy or central  
# focal point and with the potential to seemingly expand  
# in width, height, and depth. Different formations are  
# possible; for example, row houses in back-to-back  
# arrangements, patchwork-like structures with court-  
# yard houses – also called “carpet developments” – or  
# multi-story conglomerates with intricately stacked or  
# interlocked modules. Voids like patios or terraces are a  
# necessary component to improve lighting conditions.  
# In most cases, they become a distinctive design feature  
# and influence the spatial organization of the residen-  
# tial units. The private nature of the individual, outdoor  
# spaces resulting from incisions into the building mass  
# help compensate for a lack of surrounding views.  
# The necessity to organize the circulation areas  
# predominantly horizontally leads to specific solutions  
# – systems of alleyways, courtyards that flow into one  
# another, or partially or completely open ground levels.  
# In multi-story building ensembles, maisonette units  
# are the norm.  
2.6 Halen | Atelier 5 | 1961  
A dense, almost urban complex on deep,  
narrow properties on a slope. Highly  
efficient use of the construction site\:  
Residents of the upper rows have their  
gardens on the roofs of the buildings that  
lie below; i.e., they have the legal right to  
use and even build on roofs which are not  
their property. Yet the private areas are  
absolutely protected, the view from each  
individual house cannot be blocked by  
buildings. Type 12\: entrance at street level;  
covered path through front garden. The  
path axis continues in the house leading  
to the large living room; the kitchen lies  
behind the stairway. Living room with two-  
story loggia and steep stairway into the  
garden. The garden and upper levels con-  
tain two to three bedrooms with bathroom  
at the top and a living/lounge area below.  
Panoramic balcony on the upper floor. The  
garden floor opens onto the deep narrow  
garden with covered seating area. In the  
variant, the bedrooms on the garden floor  
are replaced by a multifunction room; the  
upper floor is shortened and creates room  
for a deep sun terrace. The narrower 380  
type \(again available in 2 options\) is organized  
similarly except for the placement of  
the stairs. Additional studio buildings.

The single-story housing units, each  
arranged around four patios and a back  
garden, are divided into two blocks. The  
volumes of each unit are linked using ho-  
mogenous materials, repetitive elements,  
and an all-enclosing perimeter wall, so that  
a patchwork emerges in which it is difficult  
to identify the single units. The common  
feature of the floor plans is the central  
section where the entrance, kitchen, cor-  
ridors, and bathroom are situated, and  
from where three differently sized spatial  
volumes branch off to the sides. Due to the  
spatial organization, these appendices – a  
large living room as an extension of the  
entrance patio and the two perpendicular  
bedrooms in the private part of the house  
– always have outer walls and courtyards  
on two sides, thereby facilitating cross-  
ventilation for each room individually.  
The shady patios are a reminder of more  
traditional living forms where family life  
plays out in a space visually separate from  
the outside world and passersby.

301 Kasbah | Blom | 1974  
A shared roof over a patchwork-like cluster of  
houses is equally vision and program. Below  
the houses, all raised by an entire level, an open  
space is created to foster the development of a  
lively and social milieu. The lofty covered spaces  
connect laterally to the access paths and serve  
as parking spaces and access points to the open  
staircases. They also, however, can be adapted  
by individuals or groups of residents in the form  
of community organizations, shops, and small  
businesses – the pragmatic consideration being  
that under a single roof, anything can be built  
out or changed at will.  
Starting on the second level on both sides  
of the open staircases are the two-story base  
units of all apartment types – in which the  
bathrooms, kitchens, internal staircases, and  
bedrooms above adjoin a double-height living  
room. Depending on the apartment type, ad-  
ditional modules connect to this base unit\: in  
types b and c a roof garden that is enclosed  
on three sides, in type c an additional room  
above the street below, and an entire unit,  
when type a and b are combined, essentially  
forming type d.  
To foster social diversity, roughly the  
same amount of each of these housing types  
is found throughout the complex. Type a is  
intended for use as a studio, or for students  
or young couples. Type b was developed as a  
low-income option, while type c is spacious  
enough for larger families. The upper floor  
under the gabled roof is described as a “sleep-  
ing loft” and can be subdivided if desired. In  
type d, in which the second upper floor room  
is transformed into a connecting hallway, the  
architect was not simply motivated by creat-  
ing more rooms, but by increasing the spatial  
possibilities for additional activities.

2.6 Cube house | Blom | 1984  
1 2  
Experimental living\: three levels in a tilted  
cube, supported by a hexagonal, 5-m-  
high central column. The result is a “cube  
house.” The first level contains the “street  
house”\: a triangular living and dining room  
with kitchen alcove and WC behind the  
spiral staircase; the windows are slanted  
toward the street below. The second level  
contains the “sky house”\: living/sleeping  
zones with bathroom; here, the windows  
are slanted up, toward the sky. The attic  
story accommodates the “greenhouse,”  
accessible via a ladder\: this is the daylit  
studio with a vista through the glazed peak  
of the cube. The floor plan is highly flex-  
ible in theory, because each occupant can  
interpret the individual rooms at will – at  
the same time, however, the constraints  
imposed by the limited space within the  
slanted walls dictates specific uses and  
customized furnishings. A set of two cubes  
can be combined into a single unit. With  
the exception of the “trunk,” which houses  
the private stairwell, the space below is  
available for public uses. The concept of  
this “forest of trees” arose from the desire  
to closely intertwine public and private  
spheres. Of the planned sixty units in the  
center of Helmond, three prototypes and  
the central “playhouse,” which provides  
spaces for public events in a series of  
linked “trees,” were initially realized in  
1975\. In 1984, thirty-eight additional tree  
units were built on a pedestrian bridge in  
downtown Rotterdam.

305 Galgebakken | Storgård,  
# Orum-Nielsen, Marcussen | 1974  
Car-free housing development near  
Copenhagen with row houses and garden  
courtyard houses. The design is primarily  
concerned with taking different housing  
needs into account through the provision  
of varied housing typologies, as well as  
enabling the residents to personally shape  
their immediate surroundings.  
The single-story atrium houses \(type a\)  
are based on a cross-shaped plan. Groups  
of four houses form common garden  
courtyards to the rear and front courtyards  
accessed by pedestrian paths. The en-  
trance, kitchen, bathroom, and play area  
face the path, while all bedrooms and the  
long living room overlook the garden. The  
central living room with linear kitchen and  
divisible \(work/guest-\)room serves as a  
distribution zone for the individual rooms  
complete with a separate hallway and  
bathroom. The layout makes it possible to  
sublet a wing with its own entrance, bath-  
room, kitchenette in the spacious hall, and  
garden access. The occupants are free to  
design the courtyards to their liking, sepa-  
rating them with walls or sharing them for  
common use.  
In the same way, the green space adja-  
cent to the pedestrian path and the garden  
to the rear offer residents of the two-story  
row houses \(types b and c, depending on  
the house width\) a spacious and open  
common area free to interpretation. The  
split-level row houses are characterized  
by a high kitchen and dining room lit by a  
slanted skylight, from which stairs lead up  
to a gallery level with bedrooms and down  
to the living room and an additional room.  
Scattered throughout the development is  
a further single-room house type \(type d\).  
Lined up in rows along courtyards, these  
houses are intended for either students,  
single elderly residents, or guests.

2.6 Nexus World |  
# OMA/Koolhaas | 1991  
Two building complexes, hermetically  
enclosed with black, structurally orna-  
mented concrete walls, formulate the  
gate position leading into the build-  
ing exhibition grounds “Nexus World“  
\(see also, p. 198, Steven Holl\). The large  
volumes are raised\: the open ground  
floor, lit alternatively from above and  
from the side, houses several spaces for  
public use as well as the foundations  
for twelve of the integrated apartment  
units in each complex. The light joints,  
continuous from east to west, divide  
these units into individual rows. The  
units are accessed via an open, slightly  
inclined and network-like system of  
arcades. The entrances for most units  
are located in paved yards, which con-  
nect the floors above in the manner of  
patios. These patios create a separate  
open space for each apartment and a  
degree of privacy that would otherwise  
be impossible in a development of this  
density. In the interior, the apartments  
are linked by single-strung continuous  
stairs, behind which small chambers – in  
a zigzag arrangement – project into the  
building joints. On the second floor, the  
rooms and sanitary zones are lined up  
around the courtyard. The third floor  
accommodates the common area with  
kitchen; it overlooks the roof terrace, the  
patio reaching down to the paved garden  
and the sky. Akin to a wave-like shed  
roof, one half of this area is raised. Some  
of the units have an additional balcony  
on this uppermost level, accessible via  
a ­ ladder.

On the 150th anniversary of the comple-  
tion of France’s first major workers’ hous-  
ing complex, the creation of a new and  
innovative housing development has been  
initiated by the same social housing as-  
sociation at the same location. The design  
is an adaptation of the historic building  
type and the process of ongoing modifi-  
cation to the latter by the residents. The  
so-called “Carré mulhousien” linked four  
houses on a cruciform plan into a single  
structure. Conversions and various expan-  
sions ensued over time. In the new project,  
four housing units – two of which are  
back-to-back where they have the kitchen  
and bathroom – form a single freestanding  
block. The groundfloor living room at the  
center of the unit is 5 m high; the bed-  
rooms are inserted as cubes or “docked”  
at the outside on the upper or lower level  
and some on both levels. The sliding ele-  
ments in front of the loft space above the  
kitchen/bathroom block facilitate variable  
uses\: as an open space for socializing or a  
quiet, more private space. The result is a  
complex spatial construct, with additional  
densification of use on the outside in the  
form of wire-mesh enclosed gazebos for  
plants, open spaces, external stairs, and  
parking pads. The entire construct is rather  
like a complex parcours where spatial  
boundaries have been almost dissolved,  
than an enclosed apartment complex.

2.6 Seijo Townhouse |  
# Sejima & Associates | 2007  
Like on a board game, similar volumes are  
placed in relation to one another on a field,  
either linked at the corners or shifted away  
from each other. Complex and highly varied  
apartments, most occupying one room  
per volume, are created on four levels.  
Each apartment stretches horizontally and  
vertically across several volumes, forming  
a spatial continuum in the interior without  
its boundaries being recognizable from the  
outside. Thus there is an ambivalence as  
to whether the complex is a single large  
structure with apartments or a collection of  
individual houses. Up to four volumes are  
linked on one level, where the narrow pas-  
sages at the interfaces without doors mark  
the transitions. As a result of the right-  
angled arrangement, the buildings frame  
intimate courtyards of similar size, which  
are treated as part of the spatial patchwork.  
Stairs usually connect to another room in  
the levels above and below, either provid-  
ing an entrance into the apartment or  
leading to a quieter space. The interlocking  
creates different spatial scenarios, which  
inspire interpretations of one’s own. Light  
and air flow in from alternating sides, the  
path through the apartment and the view  
leads to ever different yet similar exterior  
spaces. Every apartment has its own garden  
or a roof terrace. Although the gardens are  
separated, they remain readable as a con-  
tinuous area. This creates a complex spatial  
configuration in which the living environ-  
ments of the residents overlap.

The desire both to reduce building costs  
and engage in the design process deter-  
mined the character and structure of this  
ensemble. Prefabricated wooden modules  
comprised of standardized building ele-  
ments shortened the construction time  
and permitted residents to choose from  
different configurations.  
In this organically laid-out ensemble  
nestled into the topography of the site,  
each group consists of nine residential  
units arranged around a shared court-  
yard protecting them from the wind and  
enabling a view for all into the surround-  
ing landscaped park. From the outside  
spaces to the floor plan organization of  
the individual unit, the entire estate is  
characterized by a subtly formulated se-  
ries of thresholds separating public from  
more private spaces. Branching walkways  
lead from the main path through the  
open corners of the more private court-  
yards. These are the interfaces of the  
small, manageable communities, each  
with its own connection to the landscape  
and passages to the individual residential  
units and their backyards. The kitchen of  
each unit is oriented toward the courtyard  
to foster an area of neighborly contact,  
while the bedrooms are all located on the  
top floors.  
L-shaped constellations of three 5 × 5  
m modules form the ground floors, which  
open up with an outdoor terrace to the  
surrounding landscape. An eat-in kitchen  
occupies the corner module where a  
staircase leads to the upper floor. Situated  
to one side of this is a covered passage  
to the courtyard and a large storage room  
behind, and on the other side, an open  
living room. For the upper floor, resi-  
dents could choose between five options  
consisting of up to four modules. The  
smallest version uses only one module  
to provide a single bedroom with terrace  
above the kitchen. Two modules can be  
combined to create three bedrooms with  
an optional office or hallway as circula-  
tion space – with or without a bathroom.  
The four-module option incorporates an  
unused area of the neighboring unit.

# DETACHED HOUSE  
# As a morphological type, the detached house denotes  
# a free-standing, small residential building predomi-  
# nantly in rural or suburban contexts with buildings of  
# similar proportions. Generous amounts of space per  
# occupant, orientation in all directions, and a private  
# garden make detached houses a highly privileged form  
# of building. A car is an indispensable requirement for  
# this housing type, because it makes the dream of a  
# house in a green setting possible. The almost unavoid-  
# able consequences of this building form therefore in-  
# clude urban sprawl, the paving of natural landscapes,  
# and increased traffi c.  
# In most cases – including most of the examples  
# presented here – detached houses have a single leas-  
# ing party, who enjoys a high degree of codetermina-  
# tion in the conception and design of the house. From  
# the classic single-family home to the extreme form  
# of a spacious villa, a multitude of radical and innova-  
# tive approaches to habitation are possible, since each  
# concept need function only for one, usually known,  
# group of occupants. Thus the private home can serve  
# as an opportunity for experimentation in residential  
# architecture, often generating exciting, inspirational  
# spatial concepts, even though they are rarely directly  
# applicable to multifamily or multi-story dwellings.  
3.1 Sugden House |  
# Smithson | 1956  
The house for a couple, who were friends  
of the architects, was to be an “ordinary  
house,” with the stipulation that it should  
feature masonry and a ridge roof. The  
house is still impressive today for the  
sensitive manner in which this simple  
program was met by characterizing the  
individual rooms instead of assigning them  
rigidly or leaving them completely without  
specification. A small entrance leads into  
the large middle zone, the heart of the  
house with \(dining-\)table and fenestrated  
facade. The stairs to the bedrooms on the  
upper floor and the chimney separate the  
living room on the ground floor from the  
central dining area, although they remain  
otherwise strongly linked. A customized  
piece of furniture, usable from both sides,  
defines the far end of the space as a kitch-  
en, which provides access to the covered  
courtyard and the play-/bed-/study room  
and lies as a mediating space between  
these areas. The prefabricated windows are  
set freely into the masonry on all sides, at  
all points where a view of the exterior is  
desirable. The relationship to the garden is  
thus experienced in each of the rooms. The  
particular charm lies in the details\: e.g.,  
the manner in which the semitransparent  
trellis separates the small room above  
from the landing. This makes it possible to  
extend the common room upward. Or the  
small step, which sets the bedrooms apart  
from the common landing, thus separating  
them, and at the same time adding more  
space to the living room below.

# Mendes da Rocha | 1960  
All rooms are organized on a single raised level  
that is nearly square in plan and supported by  
only four pillars. Floor and ceiling with their  
ribbed slabs in fair-faced concrete are space-  
defining elements. To the north and south, the  
slabs transition into closed walls, perforated  
only by small, precisely placed openings for  
light and air. Bands of windows stretch along  
the entire east and west sides, interrupted on-  
ly on the west side by the stairs and the house  
entrance. The garden is enclosed with walls  
and embankments and so densely planted  
that one has the sense of being perched above  
a horizon consisting solely of trees and shrubs,  
an impression that is enhanced by the screen  
wall on the cantilevered roof structure, which  
blocks out the sky like blinders.  
The floor plan is organized into areas for  
living, dining, cooking, and working by subdivi-  
ding a single large space with a series of inser-  
ted chamber-like rooms, which are treated as  
furnishings rather than parts of the house. The  
living room is wrapped around the bedroom  
area in the form of a “U” with the result that  
the interior space along the facade functions  
as a long and tranquil communal area, behind  
which the bedrooms are screened off. However,  
when the sliding doors are open, these rooms  
expand into the living area. Bathrooms, WC,  
and walk-in closets are arranged like a filter to  
the bedrooms in the direction of the east fa-  
cade, where the living and dining areas extend  
through the entire breadth of the house. The  
bedrooms can also be opened toward this side.  
The floor plan can therefore be utilized and in-  
terpreted in multiple ways; it is brought to life  
entirely as a result of the sensual materiality,  
the diffuse light penetrating into the interior,  
and the view onto the verdant exterior.

319 Witzig House | Olgiati | 1966  
The house is entirely laid out for a sensory  
experience. The sculptural and freely com-  
posed external wall is not only a facade,  
it turns toward the surroundings in an  
almost bodily manner\: at times offering  
grandiose views of the mountain land-  
scapes, at times closed off and inward. The  
double winding stairs tie all rooms togeth-  
er in a single dynamic movement. They  
are a spatial element that at times cuts  
into the building mass, at times appears  
as an object in space, winding around the  
chimney and thereby making it the center;  
being twined around the rooms, so to  
speak, thus defining the character of the  
floor plan. Between building skin and cir-  
culation, the open living space is organized  
into niches and various usage areas by the  
chimney, the inserted kitchen block and  
the bench facing in two directions. Every  
opening is devoted to a special situation  
on the interior or exterior\: the recessed  
loggia, the funnel-like view to the outside  
from the eating nook, the inserted opening  
at the bench and the large window over-  
looking the valley. The room disposition  
continues throughout the house in similar  
fashion. The geometry of the two hallways,  
at the entrance and above in front of the  
bedrooms, mediates between the spaces  
and the stairs. The house itself is like a  
body and extraordinarily comfortable\: here,  
functionality does not remain schematic,  
but is rather entirely conceived for the  
enjoyable use of the house.

This house was designed by the architect  
for his family, and, resting on six concrete  
cores due to weak near-surface soils, ap-  
pears to hover over the inclined site. The  
U-shaped, niche-like rooms in these cores  
along the facade become a motif and are  
repeated on the other sides of the house,  
where they contain sanitary rooms or  
staircases, storage spaces or bay windows  
with integrated seating. The spatially  
dominant elements, however, are the float-  
ing wooden horizontal levels overlapping  
in an offset split-level formation over the  
terrain, which generate a near borderless  
space with numerous spatial and visual  
connections and open at multiple points  
onto outdoor terraces. The central portion  
of the Z-shaped floor plan incorporates a  
studio, living spaces, entrance and kitchen.  
Branching off to either side are the master  
and children’s bedrooms.

321 Karuizawa Capsule House |  
# Kurokawa | 1973  
One-room capsules are docked in all  
directions to a central concrete nucleus.  
The capsules are the same as those used  
for the famous larger residential tower in  
Nagakin. Their dimensions are an answer  
to the requirements for ease of transport  
and rapid assembly \(on to the nucleus\).  
This house on a hill develops from the top  
down­ wards\: the garage and roof terrace  
are on the entrance level; the floor below is  
reached by an exterior flight of stairs and  
is composed of capsules containing a tea  
room, a kitchen, and two private rooms;  
the second floor down, consisting solely  
of the “trunk,” is a living room with large  
circular window. A spiral staircase con-  
nects the stories. The capsules are ordered  
around the nucleus at increasing heights,  
suggesting a procession up­ wards to the  
tea room at the highest point. Kuro­ kawa’s  
idea of a “tea room in a space ship” was  
trans­ formed into architectural reality here\:  
state-of-the-art technology makes sense  
only when it is employed so as to enable  
people to ­ partake of pleasures such as the

A simply unusual, unusually simple floor  
plan\: per floor, the stairs provide access  
to only one of three identical units. The  
elongated apartment is divided into a  
private and a common area by a wall in  
the middle. The division of the floor area  
is effected simply by placing various ele-  
ments along the middle wall. There is no  
need for a hallway. The kitchen and loggia  
are located at the entrance. The continu-  
ous windows give the kitchen a clear view  
of the living room, dominated to the rear  
by an open fireplace. A bathroom core  
serves as a dividing element for the private  
half of the unit. The bathroom’s cabin-like  
sliding walls separate and connect the  
two bedrooms. The loggia is suspended in  
front of the facade like a separate room or  
body. The ribbons of windows along both  
longitudinal sides of the building bathe the  
interior in light.

323 2/5 House | Ban | 1995  
The 15  
×  
25 m lot is divided into five equal  
strips. These are allocated for use as\: front  
garden, interior, central courtyard, interior,  
rear garden. The house consists of two  
glass containers raised on pilotis \(reminis-  
cent of Mies’s Farns­ worth House\) that are  
linked. The area be­ neath the containers as-  
sumes the role of a “universal floor”\: sliding  
glass doors establish a visual link between  
interior and exterior and, when open,  
transform the two areas into a cohesive  
whole. The functional ele­ ments are ar-  
ranged within this large space. In keeping  
with the tradition of the Japanese home,  
sliding doors are used to temporarily  
enclose bedrooms, bathrooms, and tatami  
rooms. In a similar vein, a tent roof can  
enclose the interior courtyard when de-  
sired. Openness and intimacy are options  
that can be chosen at will in this arrange-  
ment. One level of each half of the house  
is dedicated to a large common area, \(one  
top left, and another bottom right\), which  
is seen from the private rooms across the  
court­ yard. The house is separated from the  
densely developed urban fabric by full-  
height concrete walls and planted trellises,  
and celebrates the expanse of the sky.

# Miyamoto | 1995  
A house for a mother, her two daughters,  
two lodgers, and six dogs. The design’s point  
of departure was to analyze what kind of dis-  
tances the occupants maintained and how  
they related to one another. The courtyard  
was to become the spatial and conceptual  
center of the project and was to remain  
open. The result was the arrangement of  
individual rooms cluster­ ed on a spiral ramp  
supported by steel columns. Each cluster has  
a bedroom, toilet, kitchen unit, and storage  
space, all grouped together behind a hall.  
The halls are separated from the courtyard  
by shoji screens. Each room is demarcated  
by its unique position along the ramp, from  
which it draws its individual character. Only  
the kitchen/dining area and service areas  
– on the ground level – are for shared use.  
By opening sliding doors, the dining room  
dissolves and be­ comes part of the courtyard  
with only the canti­ levered roof left to trace  
its phantom outline. The dogs play in the  
kidney-shaped yards underneath the raised  
house.

3.1 Floirac |  
# OMA / Koolhaas | 1998  
The owner, who is confined to a wheel-  
chair, expressed the wish for a complex  
house as a private cosmos. Rem Koolhaas  
designed not one, but three houses for  
the client and his family; the houses are  
stacked to promote a playful interac-  
tion of their individual characteristics.  
Thus the element that links the levels is  
transformed into the most prominent  
feature\: the owner’s moveable office. The  
central, hydraulic platform moves along  
bookshelves that reach from the basement  
to the attic and changes the configura-  
tion of spaces on each level depending  
on whether it is present or absent. Like all  
other floor levels, the basement is divided  
into two sections\: the entrance with direct  
connections to the various vertical access  
links, the kitchen, and the family TV room  
are located in the glazed front half, over-  
looking the inner courtyard. The other half  
is carved into the hillside. This area houses  
the wine cellar \(which can only be reached  
when the lift is stationed on this level\) and  
the main entrance, staged much like a dark  
cave. The living space above merges with  
the landscape beyond – it is half interior,  
half terrace, with undefined boundaries  
since the walls are fully glazed. By contrast,  
the next level is pronounced in its solid-  
ity, with the concrete monolith perforated  
only by small portholes. This upper level  
contains the family’s bedrooms, divided  
into parent house and children’s house  
linked by a small bridge. The position of  
the portholes is carefully calculated. They  
offer views onto selected highlights in the  
landscape and are designed specifically  
for visual contact with the outside from a  
walking, standing, or reclining position. The  
house derives its strength from the effec-  
tive collage of contrasts in form, material,  
and program.

3.1 wunschhaus \#1 | heide  
# von beckerath alberts | 1999  
Dream house \#1, conceived as a prefab-  
ricated house, is laid out around a core  
with two autonomous spaces and a pe-  
rimeter circulation corridor, whose neutral  
character lends itself to a multiplicity of  
uses. The location of the core allows for  
an individual interpretation of the floor  
plan with regard to functions, the different  
door types \(white double doors for rooms,  
dark wooden sliding doors for bathrooms\)  
enable the occupants to establish varying  
relationships between rooms as needed.  
To the exterior, the floor-to-ceiling sliding  
glass doors also allow for extreme open-  
ness. The house has two levels, making  
it possible to divide the zones vertically  
if required. The stairs are located next to  
the entrance. The upper and lower level  
are identical in principle, with the ground  
floor also allowing for extending one room  
into the corridor \(e.g., for cooking/din-  
ing\). On the upper level, the rear section  
of the corridor can be divided off as an  
additional room for guests or as a library,  
etc. The corridor also accommodates the  
bathrooms, which can be used individually  
or linked, and which are directly accessible  
from the rooms. When the bathroom doors  
are closed, the room located at the core  
extends all the way to the exterior wall.  
With its surrounding corridor and variety  
of views even diagonally across the rooms,  
the house creates transparency and even  
a measure of chaos\: it is up to the occu-  
pants to create quiet zones. The floor plan  
options demonstrate only some of the  
potential internal room arrangements cor-  
responding to different patterns of living.

4 Haus der Gegenwart |  
# Allmann Sattler Wappner | 2005  
The experimental house, initiated by a  
magazine competition on housing for the  
future, reverses the spatial hierarchy of  
a conventional single-family home\: the  
individual or private spaces on the ground  
floor are accessed at first. They are con-  
tained in three separate boxes surrounding  
a central forecourt and jointly support the  
shared living space above, which also con-  
nects the individual boxes with one anoth-  
er. Each of the three boxes has a separate  
entrance, additional ancillary rooms, and  
a private yard enclosed with box-hedges  
into which the personal living space ex-  
tends nearly seamlessly. All boxes can be  
subdivided, if needed, by means of dividing  
walls at the center. Stairs lead from each  
of these boxes on the ground level to the  
large common space on the second floor,  
divided into kitchen, dining, and living area  
through strategic positioning of the stairs.  
The roofs of the three boxes provide space  
for generous roof patios with wooden  
decking. The core theme is individualiza-  
tion for all users\: although the common  
area is generously proportioned as an  
interface for all inhabitants, it is essen-  
tially secondary in nature. Socializing is a  
conscious choice in this home, a reflection  
of the shift away from the single-family  
house designed solely for occupation by a  
typical nuclear family.

3.1 House O | Fujimoto | 2007  
A weekend house on the rocky Pacific  
coast for a couple that wish to be near the  
sea with a view to settling here perma-  
nently in the future – thus the brief. The  
sleeping, eating, working, and bathroom  
areas, the tatami room, and the porch  
are arranged in a ramified series like the  
branches of a tree. With the concrete wall  
facing the landside and the nearly fully  
glazed facade overlooking the sea, one  
moves through the house as if on a hik-  
ing path\: from the sleeping and entrance  
area, one has a view of the coast as if  
from a deep cave; from the living area  
the panorama unfolds expansively, while  
from the bathtub it is clearly framed. The  
subtle deviations and branches in the  
floor plan enrich not only the perception;  
they prevent a direct sightline all the way  
through, thus defining the more intimate  
areas without them being separated by  
walls. The sleeping area only comes into  
view after several changes in direction; in  
this manner, the floor plan design imposes  
subtle rules of use without formulating  
them distinctly and hermetically. All func-  
tions, which would interrupt the spatial  
rigour and poetry of this spatial concept  
– such as toilets and cabinets – are dis-  
cretely integrated into the wall.

# Kraus Schönberg | 2007  
The house is divided into two very distinct lay-  
ers, which are also clearly differentiated typo-  
logically\: the upper floor plan is compartmen-  
talized and divided into smaller spaces, while  
the lower plan is entirely open and generously  
orientated toward the outdoors. The rooms on  
the upper floor are designed in various heights\:  
master bedroom and children’s bedrooms,  
bathrooms, anterooms, and dressing rooms  
project into the lower living area. The latter is  
structured by these differences in height with-  
OSTANSICHT m 1\:100  
out being subdivided through dividing walls.  
The horizontal layering of spaces, the cut into  
the ground, the eye-level perspective of the  
horizon on all four sides, the three-dimensional  
relief of the ceiling, which creates intimate  
zones despite the open plan, all these elements  
combine to give the house a very unique char-  
acter. Another defining element is the atrium,  
– which opens to the lower level but not toward  
the top. With its bookshelves, soaring across  
the full height of the house, it serves as a con-  
necting element between the two levels. The  
randomly placed openings of differing dimen-  
WESTANSICHT m 1\:100  
sions through all room layers emphasize the  
sculptural character of the house. The entrance  
lies between the two layers, with the internal  
stairs leading upward and downward. The  
semibasement has been cut into the ground  
in such a manner as to provide as sense of  
shelter when sitting, while offering a direct view  
into the garden when standing. Seen from the  
outside, the light, sculptural volume appears to  
float above the terrain.

# HAHOH | 2007  
The clients requested a house with four  
compact rental units, designed in a man-  
ner that would also allow for entirely  
different floor plan configurations – one of  
the potential scenarios being the use as a  
multigenerational home. By virtue of their  
design and placement, the two single-  
loaded staircases function as an interface  
for various combinations\: all areas adjoin-  
ing the stairs – the apartments on the up-  
per and lower levels, the units to the right  
and left as well as the landings – can be  
linked. The original layout comprises four  
small, compact yet open apartments, each  
with a private entrance. The apartment on  
the lower level of the site \(garden apart-  
ment\) and the attic story are accessed via  
separate sets of stairs. When the partition  
wall between bathrooms and stairwell is  
taken out, the resulting layout is an apart-  
ment that covers the entire ground floor  
with an open-plan eat-in kitchen and living  
area to one side, playroom and bedrooms  
to the other side. If, on the other hand,  
the partition wall between the bottom of  
the stairs and one adjoining apartment  
is opened up on the street elevation, the  
west-facing unit is combined with the  
attic story, and the east-facing unit with  
the garden unit. If the apartments on the  
ground floor are connected on both sides  
\(front and rear\), the result is a multigen-  
erational home linked across all three  
levels with various private areas as well as  
a generous open living space on either side  
of the ground-floor stairs.

3.1 Casa Gago | Pezo von  
# Ellrichshausen | 2012  
This house situated on a hillside differenti-  
ates itself from its neighbors through its  
clear cube-shaped volume and height in  
relation to its footprint. A spiral staircase  
placed asymmetrically within a square floor  
plan marks the point of intersection of a  
spatial cross figure, dividing the house into  
four different-sized quadrants for different  
uses. The staircase defines the very essence  
of the house by connecting the 12 levels as  
they transition from more public to more  
private rooms. The required dimensions of  
the steps and the columns in the cross axes  
determined the width of the double walls  
forming a cross around the round stair-  
case, which incorporate different functions.  
On the lower, more public floors, stairs  
directly link the kitchen, dining areas, and  
the double-height living room to create an  
open enfilade. The remaining wall niches are  
used as built-in furniture so that the rooms  
themselves remain unoccupied. On the top  
floors, with the more private rooms and a  
one-and-a-half height workroom, these walls  
house WCs, bathrooms, and additional wall  
niches.

# John Lin / RUF | 2012  
Wrapped in a partially open brick structure  
able to filter in light and wind, this house  
features a floor plan figure that can be  
described as a sequence of rooms mean-  
dering around four patios. The path is the  
space\: in the center, it widens to form a  
living room extending from one side to the  
other and then branches off into spacious  
hallways on the sides. One hallway leads  
to the bedrooms, kitchen, and entrance,  
another one to the toilet, animal stall, and  
biogas unit. Each patio courtyard is given a  
specific use to complement the surround-  
ing interior spaces\: as a vestibule, washing,  
working, or planting courtyard. In the  
latter, a staircase ascends to the large roof  
terrace with stepped seating and rainwater  
reservoir. Against the backdrop of the mas-  
sive population migrations to large Chinese  
cities, this model house attempts to lend  
new vibrancy and appeal to life in the  
countryside. By implementing sustainable  
technology such as a biogas unit powered  
by pig manure, a rainwater reservoir, a  
solar thermal water heater on the roof,  
planting courtyards, and a plant-based  
water filtration system, it is also an exam-  
ple of the trend toward supply autonomy.  
Simultaneously, its use for the production  
of local artisanal crafts reinforces both the  
village community and the local economy.  
The meandering floor plan of this house  
as a space-defining principle remains  
transferrable to other contexts.

# DUPLEX  
# In many instances, duplex houses are created due to  
# the desire of two parties to build and live jointly. The  
# members of this type of coop seek to achieve a bal-  
# ance between separation and connectedness, which  
# can become a model for a special form of cohabita-  
# tion. Other duplex houses are not planned according  
# to the wishes of the occupants, but are designed in  
# series like a row house, frequently in the context of  
# a planned housing scheme. The goal of the design  
# is to protect the privacy of each neighbour, allowing  
# every one to fulfi l their dream of a house of their own  
# despite the close proximity. Unless the plan consists  
# simply of two houses placed side-by-side and shar-  
# ing a fi rewall, examples of duplex houses can often be  
# spatially complex\: in order to ensure that both units  
# benefi t from all orientations – instead of competing  
# with one another –, they are partially intertwined. Oc-  
# cupants enjoy advantages similar to dwellers in single-  
# family homes\: they have their own lot, their own drive-  
# way, and a green space on several sides. However, the  
# disadvantages are equally comparable\: although this  
# building type is somewhat less uneconomical, urban  
# sprawl, soil sealing, and traffi c are increased.  
3.2 Bruderholz | Gugger | 1996  
The charm of the undeveloped lot, reced-  
ing parallel to a row of old fruit trees,  
inspired the wish to preserve the character  
of the site and to place the building into  
the landscape as a solitary structure.  
Al­ though not visible from the outside, the  
cube is composed of two identical apart-  
ments, which are stacked crosswise. This  
provides both units with the advantage of  
having different orientations and a direct  
relationship between the ground floor and  
the exterior. From the living area oriented  
toward the street, both occupants enjoy  
a spectacular panoramic vista, and in the  
sleeping area to the rear, the tranquility of  
the gardens. The full depth and height of  
the building volume is experienced in each  
apartment. This reinforces the im­ pression  
of living in one’s own house rather than  
in an apartment. The large sliding glass  
panels for the windows and the entrances  
are retracted into the wood boarding when  
opened. The result is a pure, unfettered  
opening, which transforms the rooms  
into loggias. As to the inhabitants\: like the  
house itself, with its minimalist appear-  
ance, they enter into a direct dialog with  
the landscape.

Two families, who are friends, wanted to  
create adjoining apartments with a shared  
semipublic space for socializing with neigh-  
bours and friends. To this end, the U-shaped  
duplex building surrounds a large shared  
courtyard, which is completed into a rectan-  
gle by a two-story verandah with external  
stairs. The internal plan in the two apart-  
ments is organized according to the same  
principle\: a large open living area on the  
ground floor and individual rooms upstairs.  
The two kitchens face toward each other  
and overlook the courtyard. The living areas  
are oriented in the opposite direction, away  
from the courtyard. On the second floor,  
all rooms also face away from the court-  
yard, with the exception of the work areas,  
which are oriented in both directions. Both  
apartments can be divided on the upper  
floor, allowing for a flexible arrangement of  
rooms. The internal access areas for both  
apartments are turned toward each other  
whenever possible\: access to both units is  
provided at the ground and upper level via  
the shared verandah, the internal stairs face  
one another and are linked on the ground  
floor by the wooden terrace. Upstairs, the  
corridors to the bedrooms on the courtyard  
side also face each other and are integrated  
via the verandah into a continuous ring  
connection. Opposite to this verandah, the  
balconies for both units lie side by side;  
like the verandah and the terrace, they are  
oriented toward the shared center in the  
manner of a theater box.

Chronological evolution of  
design concept\:  
2 stories, 14 m building depth  
4 stories, 7 m building depth  
This building with two semidetached  
homes derives its structure from a highly  
individual development process, which it  
boldly displays. Two architectural firms  
were commissioned to accommodate the  
wishes of two very different clients under  
one roof. As different as their housing  
concepts were, both parties nevertheless  
asked for direct access to roof terrace and  
garden and, moreover, an unencumbered  
view of the park to the south. The living  
area was to be divided according to their  
unequal financial capacities, i.e., one-third  
to two-thirds. Following various develop-  
mental stages \(see diagrams\) the solution  
was found in a dividing wall, which does  
not constitute a continuous vertical sepa-  
ration between the halves but, instead,  
divides them in the guise of a wall, on the  
one hand, and then again as a staggered  
ceiling, all the while maintaining the same  
thickness and, what is more, with only  
minimal supporting columns, that is, in a  
very elaborate structural manner. The total  
building cube is therefore composed of  
different narrow and wide rooms, which  
are interlaced. The living areas extend far  
into the neighbouring semi and enjoy a  
view of the park across their full widths.  
The smaller semi on the left side, in par-  
ticular, which is strongly articulated in the  
vertical direction, benefits from this elon-  
gated horizontal space. The rooms flow  
into one another and feature generous  
glazed surfaces; the bedrooms and bath-  
rooms are the only fully enclosed volumes.  
The meandering course of the dividing wall  
is thus strongly visible on the facade.

3.2 Patchwork House |  
# Pfeifer, Roser, Kuhn | 2005  
Although conventional at first glance, the  
volume of this simple house reveals a sur-  
prising interior life\: a house-within-a-house  
concept in which two different tenants occu-  
py rooms that are in part stacked one above  
the other and in part facing each other, all  
connected via open stairs that are dedicated  
for the exclusive use of each tenant. The  
shared atrium, which rises across all three  
levels and in which the single-loaded stairs  
run past one another in a crisscross pattern,  
also serves as a space where the residents  
will naturally encounter one another, to  
stay awhile and socialize without restraint.  
Both units function in a fully autonomous  
manner. On the ground floor with its shared  
entrance, the two units unfold parallel to the  
stairs; this is where kitchen and living areas  
are located as well as separate spaces for  
other uses. On the upper levels, the stairs  
lead to the private rooms, now arranged  
crosswise to the stairs\: the rooms for each  
unit alternate, lying first on one side and  
then on the other, with the result that both  
tenants benefit from all orientations. The  
atrium also serves as an “energy garden,”  
which provides passive solar energy for the  
entire building.

The floor plan is based on a square grid to  
form a three-dimensional conglomerate in  
which 3 x 3 m spaces are predominantly con-  
necting rooms, linked axially or diagonally  
to form larger areas. Double-height volumes  
mark more important spaces or are used to  
access bedrooms or roof terraces above, and  
open patio courtyards seamlessly link the  
interior rooms to the outside.  
This patchwork sets the stage for two  
intertwined residential units shared by  
neighbors – one is for the factory owner and  
his family, who occasionally reside here, the  
second for the warehouse supervisor and  
his child. Where the two units intersect, an  
open connection comprised of four quad-  
rants – two in each apartment, one inside  
and one outside – houses a shared kitchen  
island stretching between the units, where  
the neighbors encounter one another from  
within their own space.  
The concept is a reference to a living  
form common in China until not long ago  
where communal kitchens, bathrooms, and  
courtyards were shared among residents.  
What was once a necessity is here freely  
chosen.

# ROW HOUSE  
# This house type is more economical in terms of con-  
# struction and energy consumption than the detached  
# house due to the large percentage of shared firewalls  
# and the relatively small facade area. It is thus afford-  
# able to more people and corresponds to the desire  
# for owning a house with a private garden. Row houses  
# allow for a better degree of densification than resi-  
# dential developments with detached houses and are  
# thus an appropriate building form for the urbanization  
# of industrial wastelands close to the city center or for  
# urban agglomerations. The classic row-house type is  
# long and narrow, oriented toward the front and rear,  
# and laid out between two closed walls. Most row houses  
# are two stories high; the floor plan is divided into  
# three sections with rooms and kitchen located at the  
# facades and access and sanitary rooms in the middle.  
# In principle, however, this type is highly flexible with  
# regard to width, depth, and height. Innovative exam-  
# ples offer entirely new layouts\: they achieve exciting  
# floor plan configurations with patios, rotation, offset  
# of levels, or change in orientation, thus relieving the  
# potential monotony of long row-house developments.  
3.3 Søholm I  
# –  
# III | Jacobsen | 1954  
The residential complex consists of  
Søholm I \(5 linked houses, with the archi-  
tect’s private home at the end\), Søholm II  
\(9 row houses along the coastal path\)  
and Søholm III \(4 row houses, stepped  
back and only single-story in order to  
leave the view open for the other units\).  
The shifted plan of the linked houses and  
the distinctive roofs and wall openings  
even on the longitudinal sides have the  
effect that each house of Søholm I is  
both part of the chain and an individual  
volume. The landscaping arises from the  
formation of the buildings comprising  
wraparound patios on the garden side  
and forecourts on the opposite side  
with entrance steps, front gardens, and  
a garage ramp. The external shape of  
the houses is closely harmonized with  
the internal layout. The dining area, for  
example, is embedded into the middle  
of the house both in cross-section and  
in plan. Located close to the entrance,  
connected via open stairs and its raised  
ceiling to the living room and oriented  
laterally toward the patio, this space is  
a key interface with the kitchen on one  
side and the bedrooms on the other.  
The kitchen leads to a set of stairs down  
to the garage, which is slightly lowered  
into the ground, and to the utility areas  
beyond as well as to an additional room,  
which defines the patio at right angles.  
Yet the living room occupies a tranquil  
position at the very top. The shape of the  
roof above it, with a band of windows  
facing northwest, guides the eye skyward,  
and also to the dining room below and  
out beyond the balcony to the sea. At  
this point, the built-in bench between  
fireplace and window beckons one to  
take everything in simultaneously – the  
surrounding landscape and the house.

3.3 The Ryde |  
# Phippen, Randall, Parkes | 1964  
High residential quality despite reduced  
costs by means of narrow building widths  
and extremely simple structural features  
\(concrete crosswalls, wooden roof frame\).  
The development of twenty-eight stag-  
gered one-story homes is structured by  
the accentuated crosswalls that demarcate  
the houses and their open spaces \(greens-  
paces to the front and rear of the house,  
as well as inner courtyards in the case of  
the larger houses\). The open spaces are  
tightly interlocked with the interior spaces  
and, except for kitchen and bath, almost all  
interior rooms are defined by sliding walls  
and can be utilized with corresponding  
freedom. The entire length of the house,  
all the way to the garden, is immediately  
visible to anyone entering. The rooms to  
left and right bulge out allowing the house  
to appear much larger. The clever use of  
natural light – by means of floor-to-ceiling  
windows, glassed-in patio, and skylights  
– also enhances the atmosphere of spa-  
ciousness and brightness. The sizes of the  
houses are varied by changing the length  
of the buildings between the crosswalls.

3.3 Diagoon Houses |  
# Hertzberger | 1976  
The idea behind the design is the inten-  
tional creation of “incomplete” houses that  
must be finished by their tenants accord-  
ing to their own needs and on their own  
responsibility. Installation and stairway  
cores are fixed, but the functions of the  
individual levels, which are staggered in  
split-levels, remain open. One room of  
each level can be separated off, with the  
rest remaining as a gallery on the central  
residential hall, which extends vertically  
through the entire house. These galler-  
ies are used for communal living. Many  
options for terraces; additions are also  
conceivable. An example\: The room next to  
the entrance, which can be completed as  
desired. The reduced floor plan examples  
represent a series of possible divisions of  
the building floor plans. The basic layout  
is as follows\: level a\: entrance \(with studio  
or garage\); level b\: kitchen with dining  
area \(plus living room or bedroom\); level  
c\: living area or in-law apartment; level d\:  
1–2 bedroom\(s\) with bathroom; level e\:  
roof terrace.

# Haas, Hermann | 1982  
Although part of a row, these houses are  
de­ signed as individual homes. Their lay-  
outs or­ ganize living on various levels\: the  
lobby leads directly to the parapet, and the  
viewer looks into the living room set a half-  
level lower. The living room is attached to  
the garden room \(library\), an­ other half-  
level down. Located on the same level is  
a house workroom \(with supply room\).  
Kit­ chen and dining areas are located on  
the ground floor level; the inserted spiral  
staircase blocks them off without di­ viding  
them. A guest room is located at the  
entrance. The bedrooms are on the upper  
floor – with oriels to the street, terraces  
toward the garden. The spacious landing  
offers a large study area. An un­ usual as-  
pect\: the double bath, accessible from two  
sides, with two washing units and bathtub  
in the middle.

The property is a slope that rises from south  
to north and east to west. A highway runs  
along the north side of the valley, hence the  
east-west orientation with an emphasis on  
the west side \(view of valley\). The high den-  
sity of the development allows only a garden  
courtyard of around 60 m² as the only open  
space for each house. However, the court-  
yards are supplemented by rooftop terraces  
of more than 20 m². Inside\: a clearspace the  
height of two stories above the dining area.  
The entire layout of the buildings \(split-level  
section, clearspace, balustrades, inside  
window openings\) is designed to maximize  
lighting. The selected materials \(light-  
filtering terrace roof, glass-brick walls on  
stairway and around courtyard\) give different  
qualities to the light. Interior and exterior  
spaces are interwoven with great complexity;  
the terrace becomes a loggia, the courtyard  
is transformed into a garden room.

355 Huizen | Neutelings Riedijk | 1996  
The first phase of the coastal development  
in Huizen consists of a series of duplex  
and single-family row houses, all facing  
north towards the water. To the south,  
the homes overlook private gardens and  
include a sunroom on the ground floor.  
The panorama units in the duplex homes  
are the most distinctive element in this  
design. Although the lot is only 6-m-wide,  
the clever stacked layout of the two duplex  
units makes it possible for each unit to  
have a living area stretching across 12 m,  
that is, across the full width of both lots.  
The continuous ribbon of windows offers  
a spectacular view of the Gooi Sea. While  
the living area of one apartment, on the  
second or third floor, occupies nearly the  
entire floor area on that level, space for  
a bedroom with bathroom and stairs is  
retained in one of the building wings. The  
recesses in the fabric allow sunlight to  
fall into the fully glazed kitchen on the  
south side and also create a kind of open  
courtyard at the entrance area. Cars are  
parked directly below the house. Generous  
roof terraces top the structure; the roof  
area also offers options for expansion.  
The single-family row houses with more  
conventional floor plans utilize the stag-  
gered design so that the oriel windows are  
oriented toward the water and the land-  
scaped beach promenade.

3.3 Borneo |  
# MAP Architects / Mateo | 2000  
The block at the end of the Borneo pen-  
insula – monolithic in appearance at first  
glance – is divided into 26 “back-to-back“  
row houses with varying layouts. The basic  
crosswall construction is treated with  
great variety, resulting in eleven different  
2–4-story unit types. The differing heights  
and recesses, introduced in the interest  
of lighting, are form-defining giving the  
complex an image of being simultaneously  
anonymous and animated. The complex is  
divided into two sections\: the north eleva-  
tion with an urban brick facade and the  
south elevation with a maritime timber  
facade. Each unit has direct access from  
the street and to the shared underground  
garage. The variety of open spaces, al-  
located to each unit, is especially notable.  
The homes on the south elevation have  
a verandah at the entrance, a large roof  
terrace, and a patio on the second floor.  
The patios are paved in glass-brick ele-  
ments to allow light to penetrate into the  
13-m-deep living area on the ground floor  
below. In the units along the north eleva-  
tion, this glass ceiling is partially raised by  
one half story height, investing the living  
room with a lofty height of 5.7 m. The units  
on the north elevation are oriented toward  
the interior of the development, overlook-  
ing patios with small lawns. The 3–5-room  
end units are unique in layout; however, all  
feature a terrace on the 4th floor. One unit  
even rises to 5 levels, projecting above the  
remaining complex. All units benefit from a  
stunning view across the water that sur-  
rounds the development on three sides.

3.3 Quinta Monroy |  
# Elemental | 2004  
The site on which 93 families had lived in an  
illegal squat, was to become their permanent  
legitimate home to ensure that they would  
not have to move away from their economic  
and social network. The solution was found  
in a dual densification strategy\: instead of  
inefficient single-family homes, row houses  
with two stacked units were developed. Future  
additions by the inhabitants were part of the  
concept; the goal was to remain within the  
budget of the housing subsidy, and to offer  
growing families the option of enlarging their  
living space with their own efforts. The apart-  
ments are conceived to allow users to easily  
expand them themselves at any time in the  
future. The expansion spaces are an elemental  
component\: they are the answer to the often  
uncontrollable growth of such housing de-  
velopments. Elements such as load-bearing  
structure, dividing walls, stairs, kitchens, and  
baths form part of the basic finishes and are  
already scaled for future expansion. Unlike  
other projects, this housing complex is de-  
signed to ensure an increase in value; the  
building concept itself, the central location,  
the “room to grow” for changing family needs  
and the presence of a communal external  
space are all important prerequisites.

# Dorte Mandrup Arkitekter | 2006  
The row houses were created in the context  
of a housing exhibition. Arranged in two  
rows, each segment or terrace is slightly  
staggered in relation to its neighbour, in  
harmony with the gentle slope of the ter-  
rain. Although the atrium in each unit is only  
roughly 1 m in width, it runs front-to-back  
across the entire depth of the row house; the  
atrium terminates in a clerestory set into a  
triangular vault. However, the unique charac-  
teristic of this typology is that ground floor  
and the upper level are arranged on opposite  
sides of this atrium, with the result that all  
units are stacked within each other. The bed-  
room on the garden side is at right angles to  
this atrium, separated only by a glass wall;  
a glass sliding door leads from the upstairs  
landing into the bedroom. The atmosphere  
in the apartment is bright and open; the  
many sightlines resulting from this arrange-  
ment make it spacious and more complex  
in appearance than it is. The stairs are like a  
piece of furniture incorporated into the wall,  
into which a WC, storage space, and one of  
the two kitchen rows are also integrated on  
the ground floor. It is this densification of  
ancillary functions that creates the generous  
and open feel in the living room area. The  
staggered arrangement of the row houses  
creates additional space for another indi-  
vidual room, a bathroom, and a roof patio  
in the two end units. The row houses have  
front- and backyards, with entrance vesti-  
bules that also serve as a privacy screen.

3.3 Bjørnveien |  
# Dahle, Dahle, Breitenstein | 2007  
The compact housing development in a  
suburb of Oslo is both a combination of  
and a variation on row-house typologies.  
Here, the row houses are arranged in  
an unusual manner around a triangular  
communal courtyard at the center, which  
is often reserved for privacy in other  
row-­ house developments. The courtyard is  
bordered on one side by a series of rather  
conventional row houses and by a row of  
staggered patio houses on the other. A  
tall wall forms the third boundary of the  
courtyard garden, which is located above  
the underground garage and toward which  
nearly all patios are facing.  
Due to the staggered layout of the patio  
houses, the individual units are oriented si-  
multaneously to the west and to the south  
and benefit from three open spaces\: the  
west-facing front garden at ground level,  
the two-story patio as the middle of the  
house and the large walled-in terrace to  
the south, which also marks the entrance.  
The directional shift from south to west is  
subtly reprised in the interior\: the WC and  
wardrobe block and the patio indicate the  
way into the house and divide the interior  
into areas\: the dining area with a view onto  
the patio, half-hidden behind it the kitchen  
and the internal corridor to the living area.  
Next, the floor plan turns in the other  
direction and the internal path leads either  
down the stairs or toward the living room  
overlooking the garden. On the lower level,  
the individual bedrooms are arranged in  
series, one behind the other, and overlook  
either the garden or the patio. The corridor,  
which reaches across the entire house and  
is bordered by built-in cabinets, connects  
with a second entrance, which leads  
directly to the garage.

3.3 Regatta | Bovenbouw | 2016  
Part of a larger new residential develop-  
ment, seven houses form a trapezoidal  
block, in which both the block as a whole  
and the individual houses are emphasized.  
All sides of the block – whether part of a  
building or the perimeter wall – are en-  
closed with the same brickwork. The gable  
facades are oriented to the narrow sides  
of the block while the eaves sides face  
its long sides. Two freestanding houses  
occupy the orthogonal corners while the  
remaining volumes translate the form of  
the block into five trapezoidal row houses.  
Orthogonally offset to one another on their  
back garden side, they adhere at the front  
to the oblique block edge, thus forming  
a striking, zigzagging roofline along the  
street. In this way, a correlation between  
the articulation of the block and the indi-  
vidual houses is created.  
A feature of particular interest in the  
mid-block house type is a split-level living  
area that extends vertically through the  
entire building. It is arranged around the  
triangular void that occurs between the  
angled street facade and the orthogonal  
orientation of the rest of the house. The  
staircase ascends through this space, fol-  
lowing the geometry of the surrounding  
walls and connecting the eat-in kitchen  
on the ground floor, with its large window  
to the private yard, to the living room  
above that overlooks the street. Offset  
by a few further steps, a corridor open to  
this living space leads to children’s bed-  
rooms, while the next flight of stairs goes  
up to the master bedroom and bathroom  
on the top floor. A maximum amount  
of spatial effect is thus generated in an  
extremely compact volume.
