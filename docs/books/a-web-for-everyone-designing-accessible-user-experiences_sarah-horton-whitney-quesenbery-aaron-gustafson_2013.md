# Who Should Read This Book?  
You may be a web or user experience designer, thinking about what makes  
a product appealing to many people or how to meet the needs of a niche  
audience. You may be a programmer just handed a list of accessibility cod-  
ing issues that need repair. You may be a team lead with a mandate from  
leadership to make accessibility a product differentiator. You might have  
learned that your organization is under scrutiny from disability rights  
organizations. You may be an advocate for people with disabilities, looking  
for ways to make a case for accessibility to a product design team.  
No matter your title or skills, you are probably a member of a team that  
brings together many skills and roles to the task of building products.  
And you are thinking about accessibility. For accessibility thinking,  
you need to understand how your work fits with the work of others on  
your team, and how your decisions and actions affect millions of people  
around the world who use the web.  
This book will help you get started with accessibility or provide a struc-  
ture for your accessibility thinking. It offers a framework composed of  
accessible user experience principles and guidelines that will help you  
create websites and web applications that are accessible for everyone.  
# What’s in This Book?  
Chapter 1, “A Web for Everyone,” lays out the accessibility equation  
and a framework of principles and guidelines for an accessible user  
experience. The framework is formed from three bodies of work\: the Web  
Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.0\), the Principles of Universal  
Design, and the concepts behind Design Thinking.  
Chapter 2, “People First,” introduces a group of personas—realistic but  
fictional characters that appear throughout the book to show how acces-  
sible design can have an impact on people’s lives.  
Chapters 3–10 cover accessible user experience principles. We start  
each chapter with an example that demonstrates how the principle is  
enacted in the “real world” and why it is important for the web. Then  
we detail how to achieve the principle through supporting guidelines  
related to strategy, design, content, and coding. We include information  
iv about who is responsible and list the relevant WCAG 2.0 principles,  
guidelines, and success criteria. At the end of each chapter, we profile a  
leader in the area of accessible design.  
The principles are\:  
• Chapter 3, “Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals”  
• Chapter 4, “Solid Structure\: Built to Standards”  
• Chapter 5, “Easy Interaction\: Everything Works”  
• Chapter 6, “Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users”  
• Chapter 7, “Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning”  
• Chapter 8, “Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation”  
• Chapter 9, “Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses”  
• Chapter 10, “Universal Usability\: Creates Delight”  
Chapter 11, “In Practice\: An Integrated Process,” provides guidance  
for how to weave accessibility best practices into the fabric of your orga-  
nization. A web for everyone will become a reality when accessibility is a  
core value and is considered just part of making things.  
Chapter 12, “The Future\: Design for All,” takes a look at what it might  
mean to have a web for everyone, before sending you off to your own  
journey into the future, to play your part.  
There are three appendixes. The first is a list of the accessible user expe-  
rience principles and guidelines in this book, as a handy reference. The  
second maps the WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria to  
the Accessible UX principles and guidelines to help organizations aim-  
ing to meet the standard. Finally, there is a comprehensive reading list.

How to Use This Book v Frequently  
# Asked qUestions  
I’m not a designer \(or I’m not a developer\),  
so why should I read this book?  
It’s difficult to imagine a context in which one person could take a prod-  
uct, from soup to nuts, and make it accessible. There are so many decisions  
to be made, and accessibility must be considered at every step along the  
way. A designer or developer can’t make accessibility happen alone.  
If the decisions you make as part of your work impact someone’s experi-  
ence of a digital product, you need to know how to make decisions that  
will not result in accessibility issues.  
If you are leading an organization or a team, you may need to shake  
things up and change how you do business in order to achieve  
accessibility. You can’t just tack it on and hope it sticks. You need  
everyone to change their processes to make accessibility part of their  
practice. Chapter 11 looks at putting accessibility into practice.  
This isn’t part of my job description,  
so whose job is it?  
The simple answer is that we are all responsible for making our part of a  
project accessible. Rather than try to list all the different roles, titles, and  
skills, we identify three big groups\:  
• Design\: How will we create a great user experience for all?  
Design includes all of the disciplines of UX and web design\: informa-  
tion architecture, interaction design, information design, graphic  
design, and content strategy.  
• Content\: What does the product say, and how does it say it?  
Content includes the ongoing work to plan and produce text, images,  
audio, video—all the information in the site or app.  
• Development\: How is the product built?  
Development includes programming, coding, scripting, markup, as  
well as the templates and stylesheets that content authors use.  
In Chapters 3 through 10, we identify both who has the primary respon-  
sibility for each aspect of accessibility and how all the other roles  
support it.  
vi How big an issue is accessibility anyway?  
The U.S. Census Bureau says that over 47 million Americans have a dis-  
ability of some kind. The UN and the World Bank say this adds up to 650  
million people worldwide. That’s around 10% of everyone in the world.  
At some point in our lives, disability will affect most of us, no matter who  
we are, especially as we get older. By the time we retire, over 30% of us  
will have some disability, even if it is minor.  
To put a face on these numbers, we’ve created a set of personas of web  
users. They don’t represent everyone, but they will introduce you to some  
of the ways people with disabilities use the web. You’ll meet them in  
Chapter 2.  
I’m already doing responsive  
design. Isn’t that enough?  
Working to standards and responsive design are both important criteria  
for accessibility. One way to think about accessibility is that assistive  
technologies, such as screen readers and alternate keyboards, are just  
another kind of device. When a site is designed to be flexible, it works  
better on all devices. Chapter 4 covers how to support accessibility with  
a solid structure.  
Accessible UX goes further, to be responsive to differences in people as  
well as devices. It’s about making sure that the ways users interact with  
your site or application \(Chapter 5\), navigate \(Chapter 6\), or read the  
screen \(Chapter 7\) allow for user preference.  
Is content part of accessibility?  
It sure is! There are many reasons why people have trouble reading\: cog-  
nitive problems like aphasia or dyslexia, physical or vision disabilities,  
low literacy, or reading in a second language. But even skilled readers  
can have problems when they are rushed, tired, stressed, or reading on a  
small screen. Accessible content is written in plain language \(Chapter 8\)  
and presented clearly and flexibly \(Chapter 7\).  
Frequently Asked Questions vii Should I follow Section 508 or WCAG?  
WCAG 2.0, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, is a standard pub-  
lished by the W3C. That means it was created with input from people  
around the world and reflects the best international consensus. Section  
508 is a national regulation in the United States. Other countries and the  
EU have their own laws and regulations.  
If your product is covered by a specific regulation, of course you must  
meet its requirements. But if you are thinking about accessibility for  
other reasons, WCAG 2.0 is the place to start. It’s a robust standard that  
is flexible enough to apply in different contexts—websites, desktop apps,  
mobile apps, even web-enabled teakettles can be measured against the  
WCAG success criteria.  
The good news is that most standards are very similar. The even better  
news is that the U.S. Access Board \(the folks who manage Section 508\)  
has proposed that the next version of Section 508 will use WCAG 2.0  
Level AA as its requirements for web content. The EU is also working on  
new accessibility regulations, and we’ve been told that they, too, will be  
based on WCAG 2.0 Level AA. We have our fingers crossed, because in  
today’s global technology world, it would be great to have one standard  
for web accessibility. You’ll find a mapping of the accessible UX princi-  
ples to WCAG 2.0 in Appendix B.

About the Authors 268  
xvi Contents Foreword  
I was an only child, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise  
that I grew up thinking the world revolved around  
me. In fact, I’ll be the first to admit that I was a pretty  
selfish kid. Well-behaved, certainly, but not terribly  
concerned with how my actions affected others.  
As an only child, the Golden Rule my grandparents insisted was so  
important—Do unto others as you would have them do unto you—didn’t  
really resonate. But I was a kid, what did I know? I was sheltered. I was  
young. I was the sole beneficiary of my parents’ love, time, and money. I  
had a pretty good life, but I lacked perspective.  
I like to think I’ve grown immensely in the intervening years. Through  
my work, travel, and moving around a lot, I’ve experienced dozens of  
cultures, and I’ve met hundreds of new people, each with their own life  
experiences, needs, and desires. Exposure to their unique perspectives  
has broadened my own and helped me break down the psychological  
barriers I maintained between me and the “others.”  
But it wasn’t until I started working on the web that I came to a full  
understanding of the importance of the Golden Rule. Prior to becoming  
a developer, the ramifications of my decisions were fairly limited. But on  
the web, every decision I make can have a profound effect on hundreds  
of thousands \(if not millions\) of people’s lives. I can make checking into a  
flight a breeze, or I can make it a living hell.  
That’s a lot of power. And to quote Stan Lee\: “With great power comes  
great responsibility.”  
My mom always told me that if you choose to do something, you should  
do it well, so I made it my mission to make the web an easy-to-use,  
friendly, and accessible place. I chose to make the Golden Rule central  
to my work.  
As schmaltzy and self-aggrandizing as all that may sound, it’s also pretty  
shrewd. The Golden Rule can do wonders for your business. After all,  
what is good customer service if not treating someone like a human  
being worthy of your time, consideration, and respect? If we spend every  
day looking for new ways to make our customers’ lives better, we’ll  
create a lasting legacy and build a strong base of customer advocates  
along the way.  
xvii A commitment to universal accessibility is the highest form of customer  
service. It recognizes that we all have one special need or another at one  
time or another in our lives, and that fact should not preclude us from  
experiencing all the web has to offer. It’s about providing everyone with  
equal opportunity to engage with your brand experience, even though  
they may do so in different ways. It breaks down the barriers between  
“us” and “them” and recognizes the humanity in our customers.  
And it’s really not that hard.  
In the pages that follow, Whitney and Sarah beautifully lay out the case for  
accessibility, show you what it looks like, and demonstrate just how simple  
it is to achieve. They introduce us to a series of personas—Trevor, Emily,  
Jacob, Lea, Vishnu, Steven, Maria, and Carol—and help us effortlessly slip  
into each of their shoes, to see the struggles they experience when using  
the web, and to recognize our own needs and desires in their own.  
In a time when many of us are scrambling to keep up with technologi-  
cal advancements and the opportunities they create, this book grounds  
us in what really matters\: people. This book is a roadmap to providing  
incredible customer service and realizing the Golden Rule in our work  
and—much like the code we write and experiences we design—the ripple  
effect it generates is sure to bring about a more equitable web.

Summary 10 but there is still much work to be done to make the web an  
The web is making the world a smaller and more connected place,  
inclusive place that everyone can use. As web professionals, our  
decisions define and shape the web landscape. They can create barri-  
ers, and they can remove them. Guided by an understanding of people’s  
needs, it’s also possible to avoid barriers altogether, right from the start.  
The approach you take defines whether the web is, indeed, for everyone.  
In this book, we will present a design approach that begins and ends  
with people. We believe that great design starts by thinking about how  
to make products work for everyone. We will take a broad view, look-  
ing beyond the idea of an average user in a typical setting to explore the  
widest range of user abilities and contexts that we can imagine. Expand-  
ing “design thinking” to include all people, we might call it “accessibility  
thinking,” which is using design thinking for accessibility.  
Diversity is part of the richness of life. There’s even evidence that differ-  
ences in human brains and how we perceive the world are as essential as  
biodiversity is to the rich ecosystem of plants and animals.  
Instead of pretending that hidden away in a vault somewhere  
is a perfectly “normal” brain, to which all other brains must be  
compared … we need to admit that there is no standard brain,  
just as there is no standard flower, or standard cultural or  
racial group, and that, in fact, diversity among brains is just as  
wonderfully enriching as biodiversity and the diversity among  
cultures and races.  
Thomas Armstrong, The New Field of Neurodiversity  
www.alternet.org/story/147107/  
We know that by seeking answers to complex and even singular chal-  
lenges, we will discover solutions that benefit everyone.  
When we have a web for everyone, people with diverse abilities and  
contexts can use the web successfully and enjoyably.  
# Understanding the  
# Accessibility Equation  
Design isn’t simply about how something looks. A good design is visu-  
ally appealing but also meets real needs, has substance and depth, and  
works well and intuitively.  
2 Chapter 1 Designing is an activity. When you make decisions about a product,  
and your decisions impact the lives of its users, you are designing—  
whether you think of yourself as a designer or not. The strategist defines  
the purpose and goals, the interaction designer focuses on how users  
will interact with the product, the visual designer creates the look, the  
content strategist gives the product a voice, and the developer makes  
everything work. Whatever the title and task, all of these roles are  
engaged in the activity of design.  
When we talk about design, we mean it in this larger sense\: the umbrella  
over all the skills and disciplines that contribute to the user experience.  
No matter what your roles or skills are, it’s important that you—that all  
of us—own the term “design” because it comes with incumbent respon-  
sibilities, which we need to own as well. Design has the capacity to  
improve lives. When we wield such a powerful tool, we need to appreci-  
ate its power so we are able to use it for good.  
Accessibility  
Like usability, accessibility is a quality—in this case, it means how easily  
and effectively a product or service can be accessed and used. Physical  
and cognitive ability occur along a spectrum. Everyone has a limit as  
to what they can physically accomplish and intellectually comprehend.  
Good accessibility is designed for the full range of capabilities, as well as  
for the context of use or environmental constraints.  
As Ben Shneiderman put it in his book, Leonardo’s Laptop, technology  
must be designed to include people with “new or old computers, fast or  
slow network connections, and small or large screens, ... young and old,  
novice and expert, able and disabled, ... those yearning for literacy, over-  
coming insecurities, and coping with varied limitations.”  
When websites and applications are badly designed, they create bar-  
riers that exclude people from using the web as it was intended. Poor  
accessibility creates a disabling environment where the design does not  
consider the wide variation in human ability and experience. In other  
words, disability is a conflict between someone’s functional capability  
and the world we have constructed. In this social view of disability, it is  
the product that creates the barrier, not the person, just as design is at  
fault when a site has poor usability.  
We could write this as an equation\:  
Ability + Barrier = Disability  
A Web for Everyone 3 The question, then, is how to avoid creating barriers and thus maxi-  
mize the accessibility of a product? The answer\: by adopting a practice  
of accessibility.  
When people come first, designers think about real people with real  
needs. In Chapter 2, “People First,” we’ll introduce eight mini-portraits  
of people who use the web and who also happen to have disabilities.  
Starting with personas like these, you can make sure to design in the  
necessary features so that everyone has what they need to be successful  
with your websites and applications.  
Think about a building. Public buildings do not generally provide wheel-  
chairs for users with limited mobility. However, they are constructed so  
that visitors using wheelchairs can get around. Similarly, designers need  
to anticipate the needs of visitors to their websites and web applications  
and make sure that the necessary features are available to those who  
need them.  
Inclusive design  
Let’s go further and think about what it takes to design a great user  
experience for everyone. We can aim to reverse the equation from one  
that ends in a barrier to one that includes everyone.  
Design + Accessibility = Inclusive Design  
A universal web is designed for all, inclusive of geography, language, and  
culture. It’s a place that is available for people of all abilities, aptitudes,  
and attitudes. In short, design has the power to not only remove barriers  
but also not to create them in the first place.  
The terms universal design, inclusive design, barrier-free design, human-  
centered design, and design-for-all are all concepts that strive toward a  
common goal\: to make the user experience the first concern in making  
design decisions and to expand the description of users to include a wide  
range of human ability.  
# Building a Framework for  
# Accessible User Experience  
Our goal with this book is an approach that encourages design for every-  
one, where accessibility is not approached as a last-minute checklist of  
additions that are piled onto the product, but rather a set of features that  
are designed in place from the start.  
4 Chapter 1 We created a framework, based on established design principles, to iden-  
tify guidelines and strategies for incorporating accessibility into any  
website or application throughout the design and development process.  
The nine principles are\:  
• People First\: Designing for Differences  
People are the first consideration, and sites are designed with the  
needs of everyone in the audience in mind.  
• Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals  
People enjoy products that are designed for the audience and guided  
by a defined purpose and goals.  
• Solid Structure\: Built to Standards  
People feel confident using the design because it is stable, robust,  
and secure.  
• Easy Interaction\: Everything Works  
People can use the product across all modes of interaction and  
operating with a broad range of devices.  
• Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users  
People can navigate a site, feature, or page following self-explanatory  
signposts.  
• Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning  
People can perceive and understand elements in the design.  
• Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation  
People can read, understand, and use the information.  
• Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses  
People can understand and use information contained in media,  
such as images, audio, video, animation, and presentations.  
• Universal Usability\: Creates Delight  
People can focus on the experience and their own goals because the  
product anticipates their needs.  
Each principle has a set of guidelines, which we will cover in detail in the  
following chapters.  
To construct this framework, we stand on the shoulders of giants, build-  
ing on three important bodies of work\: the Web Content Accessibility  
Guidelines, the Principles of Universal Design, and design thinking.  
A Web for Everyone 5 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  
The Worldwide Web Consortium \(W3C\) sponsors many efforts in support of  
accessibility, which is not surprising given the commitment of its founder\:  
The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone  
regardless of disability is an essential aspect.  
Tim Berners-Lee  
W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web  
The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative \(WAI\) develops web accessibility  
standards and guidelines for web and software developers. The two most  
important are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.0\) and  
the Accessible Rich Internet Applications \(WAI-ARIA\) standard. The  
WAI also provides guidelines for developing web authoring tools \(ATAG\)  
and software, like browsers and media players \(UAAG\).  
In addition to standards that are specifically about accessibility, the WAI  
works with other W3C standards projects, including the HTML5 stan-  
dard, the next version of the basic language of the web. This standard is  
critical to making a web for everyone, because there, at the core, is where  
the basic structures make it easier—or harder—to make a site or appli-  
cation accessible.  
The WAI also hosts a great number of educational resources, including  
the very helpful document, “How People with Disabilities Use the Web”  
\(www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/\).  
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.0\) are organized  
under four foundational principles, which conveniently form the acro-  
nym POUR\:  
• Perceivable\: Information and user interface components must be  
presented to users in ways they can see or hear.  
• Operable\: User interface components and navigation must be  
designed so that users can interact with them and they can support  
assistive technologies such as screen readers.  
• Understandable\: Information and the operation of user interface must  
communicate clearly and consistently so that the content is readable.  
• Robust\: Content must be written so that it can be interpreted reliably  
by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.  
Having principles as part of WCAG 2.0 is an important step toward  
incorporating accessibility into design. Rather than simply following  
6 Chapter 1 the technical guidelines as a checklist, the principles offer designers an  
approach to meeting user goals. The principles articulate the “why,” and  
the guidelines articulate the “how” of web accessibility.  
We used the POUR principles to think broadly about user needs and  
WCAG 2.0 to identify the accessible features that must be present in the  
design. In Appendix B, “WCAG 2.0 Cross-Reference,” we map the prin-  
ciples and guidelines to our framework.  
Principles of Universal Design  
In 1996, a group of designers, architects, and rehabilitation engineers  
developed a set of principles to support the universal design approach.  
The approach was based on a philosophy articulated by Ron Mace, an  
architect, disability rights advocate, and founder of the Center for Uni-  
versal Design at North Carolina State University.  
Universal design is the design of products and environments  
to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible,  
without the need for adaptation or specialized design.  
Ron Mace  
The Principles of Universal Design start from the premise that there is no  
typical, average, or normal user. Rather there is a basic understanding  
that user context will vary widely based on circumstances. With vari-  
ance as the norm, the principles support a design process that makes  
sure that any needs arising from differences are met by the design.  
• Equitable Use\: The design does not disadvantage or stigmatize any  
group of users.  
• Flexibility in Use\: The design accommodates a wide range of indi-  
vidual preferences and abilities.  
• Simple, Intuitive Use\: Use of the design is easy to understand,  
regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or cur-  
rent concentration level.  
• Perceptible Information\: The design communicates necessary  
information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions  
or the user’s sensory abilities.  
• Tolerance for Error\: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse  
consequences of accidental or unintended actions.  
• Low Physical Effort\: The design can be used efficiently, comfortably,  
and with a minimum of fatigue.  
A Web for Everyone 7 • Size and Space for Approach and Use\: Appropriate size and space  
is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of  
the user’s body size, posture, or mobility.  
Universal design is appealing because it provides an intentional, designed  
approach—aesthetic and elegant—while creating products that are often  
beneficial to everyone. Even though the Principles of Universal Design  
were written in the early days of the web, the principles and associated  
guidelines map well to the web environment. As authors, we used these  
principles to guide our work in the direction of universal access.  
You can read the complete universal design principles and supporting  
guidelines at the Center for Universal Design at http\://tinyurl.com/the-  
principle-of-universal-des. You can learn more about universal design  
in our profile of Valerie Fletcher in Chapter 11, “In Practice.”  
Design Thinking  
Design thinking is an approach to problem solving popularized by Tim  
Brown from the design firm IDEO. It’s based on the idea that the types  
of thinking and methods behind what we call user experience design  
benefit all types of decision making processes, and that applying design  
thinking broadly to challenges and opportunities will produce more  
successful outcomes.  
Thinking like a designer can transform the way you develop  
products, services, processes—and even strategy.  
Tim Brown  
The philosophy behind design thinking goes something like this\: If you  
think about technology, you get technological products that don’t meet  
human needs. But if you think more broadly—about the social environ-  
ment the product will be used in and the people in that setting—you will  
get products that are truly designed for people.  
Several aspects of the design thinking approach are particularly helpful  
in thinking about designing for accessibility.  
• Integration and iteration\: The full range of design is considered  
throughout the project, rather than focusing only on the surface layer  
to make an already conceived product appealing. The entire product  
is designed by imagining an array of possible approaches; and then,  
through an iterative process of prototyping and testing, homing in on the  
best approach based on feedback about the effectiveness of the design.  
8 Chapter 1 • Divergent thinking\: Imagine possibilities without constraints. All too  
often, accessibility solutions come down to code, without consider-  
ation of whether the overall design approach is the right one. Divergent  
thinking in the early phases of a project, exploring options for acces-  
sible designs, yields innovative designs that are also accessible.  
• Convergent thinking\: Choose from all the ideas the ones that are  
most likely to work, given the environment. This is also important for  
accessibility\: choosing among options the ones that best suit the web  
environment and meet diverse needs.  
• Human centered\: Design thinking is powered by an understanding  
of people’s wants, needs, and behaviors, which set the direction for  
a project, as well as feedback from people that helps refine solutions  
throughout the process.  
• Insight\: To gain human centered insights, you need to understand  
what works best for people who access and operate the web in dif-  
ferent ways. Ideally, this means observing people in their context,  
watching what they do, and hearing what they say. Stories also gener-  
ate empathy, which feeds insight. In the next chapter, we’ll present  
personas that we believe will provide the information needed for  
empathy and insight, and that will inspire creative, divergent think-  
ing about ways to provide accessible solutions.  
# Using Design Thinking for Accessibility  
Design thinking could transform the practice of web accessibility. To  
date, much of the work on accessibility has focused mainly on modifying  
code to comply with guidelines and specifications. This approach can  
only achieve incremental improvements. But applying design thinking  
to the challenge of accessibility shifts to an innovative approach that  
could yield substantive new ideas—for example, holistic approaches that  
incorporate accessibility into design.  
In many cases, accessibility is often considered only at the end of the  
development process, typically during quality assurance or even after  
launch. Resolving accessibility issues on a finished product often yields  
unsatisfying solutions, for the designer and the user—the digital equiva-  
lent of a wooden ramp stuck on the side of a beautiful building.  
A design thinking approach includes accessibility throughout the pro-  
cess. Design thinking also requires going broad and thinking about  
many different kinds of people in the environment. Instead of design-  
ing for a few and then bolting on accommodations for people with  
A Web for Everyone 9 disabilities, you can include them in your thinking from the beginning.  
And with design thinking, you can use your designer’s toolkit—explora-  
tion, prototyping, and testing—to integrate accessibility into elegant,  
accessible products.  
WCAG + Universal Design + Design Thinking = A Web for Everyone  
We’d like to suggest a radical idea\: How much more innovative could the  
web be if everyone used design thinking for accessibility? Instead of lim-  
iting creativity, accessibility opens up new avenues for exploration and  
results in even more awesome products.  
# Summary  
Designing a web for everyone combines good design and usability  
with accessibility to create inclusive design.  
The principles in this book are built on\:  
• The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility  
Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0, a standard for coding accessible websites.  
WCAG 2.0 is also the basis for national regulations in the U.S.,  
the U.K., the European Union, and elsewhere. WCAG 2.0’s POUR  
principles provide the foundation for web accessibility guidelines  
and best practices.  
• The Principles of Universal Design, seven principles for creating  
architectural spaces, industrial design, and digital products that  
work for the widest range of human abilities.  
• Design thinking, an approach to solving any kind of design prob-  
lem that emphasizes grounding the process in understanding the  
human needs, rather than starting from a technology.  
By combining the WCAG guidelines and POUR principles, universal  
design, and design thinking, and starting from the user experience,  
you can create websites and web applications that work for every-  
one—including people with disabilities.

Summary 34 It can be hard to think about using the web in ways that are different  
from your own experience. Your assumptions about use are based  
on your own experiences with social and work contexts, cultural  
norms, individual preferences, and your physical abilities. For example,  
some people can’t imagine reading a book without the tactile feel of  
print; others embrace ebooks both for the new reading experiences they  
offer and because they fit better into their lives in some way. Similarly,  
it may be hard to imagine navigating a website without actually seeing  
where to click.  
When designing for differences, people are the first consideration,  
and sites are designed with the needs of everyone in the audience  
in mind.  
# Know Your Audience  
User experience—including usability and accessibility—starts with users.  
As Whitney Hess eloquently put it in her blog, Pleasure and Pain, “If you  
design entirely based on intuition without ever gathering intel from a single  
human being who might at some point in their life come into contact with  
your business, I’m sorry, but you just aren’t a user experience designer.”1  
Those are strong words, but this can’t be said strongly enough\: You have  
to know the people you are designing for. And that includes people with  
disabilities.  
It’s not as hard as you think. You may find people with a variety of abili-  
ties who are already part of your audience.  
Be sure to consider the diversity of needs among visitors to your site.  
In addition to all of the ways the site itself can be formatted for easier  
access, consider language preferences, literacy or reading habits, and the  
devices or assistive technology used. Including people with disabilities  
in user experience design is even easier if you are doing your research  
or testing online. Most of all, remember that people with disabilities are  
people first, with habits, context, emotions, and preferences—part of the  
audience for your work.  
User research or usability testing is not just something you do once and  
check off your list. Keep users in mind throughout the project, using all  
the UX techniques at your disposal, from early interviews, personas, sce-  
narios, and usability testing.

12 Chapter 2 Just Ask  
One of the best guides to including people with disabilities in user  
research is Shawn Henry’s book Just Ask\: Integrating Accessibility  
Throughout Design.  
She reminds us to look for users with disabilities who are appropriate for  
our product\:  
Find people who are fairly experienced using products like yours.  
If people use assistive technologies with your product, you prob-  
ably want people who are skilled with their assistive technology.  
Later in testing, you might want to include some novices, but early  
on you want people who can teach you well.  
And to consider individual differences, don’t just lump all people with  
disabilities into one user group\:  
People with disabilities are as varied as any users; they come  
from a variety of backgrounds and have varied interests, likes  
and dislikes, goals and skills. They have different experiences, dif-  
ferent expectations, and different preferences. They use different  
interaction techniques, different adaptive strategies, and different  
assistive technology configurations.  
Be careful not to assume that feedback from one person with a  
disability applies to all people with disabilities. A person with  
a disability doesn’t necessarily know how other people with the  
same disability interact with products, nor know enough about  
other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility  
issues. Just as you would not make design decisions based on feed-  
back from just one user, don’t make accessibility decisions based  
only on the recommendations of one person with a disability.  
What works for one person might not work for everyone with that  
disability or for people with other disabilities.

People First\: Designing for Differences 13 About Personas  
To help us think about all the different people who are served by innova-  
tive, accessible, universal design, we created eight personas. Personas  
are a way of combining user research data from many sources into a  
fictional but realistic character. Personas have names and personal char-  
acteristics and abilities, along with aptitudes for using technology, and  
attitudes about their experiences. They let us look across individuals to  
see patterns. They are used as stand-ins for all of the real users during  
the design process so that we remember to put people first, considering  
how we can make their experience an excellent one.  
We’ll introduce you to the personas we created for this book. Then  
throughout the chapters that follow, you will find scenarios and  
vignettes that illustrate how these personas use the web—and how you  
can design for them.  
To create the personas, we used many public data sources on people  
with disabilities, from the World Health Organization to the U.S. Census  
Community Population Survey, to ground the personas in real data.  
We have tried to bring some of the statistics and demographic data  
about people with disabilities to life in the stories of the personas. These  
stories are based on the many people we have met as colleagues, read  
about in their blogs, and worked with during user research sessions. And  
because this is a book about user experience design for the web, we have  
created personas that are web users. They have the skills, desire, educa-  
tion, and resources to use technology.  
No small set of personas can represent the entire world of people with  
disabilities. It’s important to remember that a person with a disability is,  
first, a person. They like their hometown sports team or love going to the  
theater. They are funny or quiet, or quick to anger, just like everyone else.  
14 Chapter 2 What’s in the Personas?  
Each persona has a name, a gender, and an age. They all have a personal  
story about their family, their work, or where they live. These details are  
not meant to limit the views of the personas, but to anchor them in a  
realistic setting.  
The personas also include information about their abilities, aptitudes,  
and attitudes, using the model that Ginny Redish and Dana Chisnell  
developed in their work on how older adults use the web\:  
• Ability\: Information about their ability \(physical, cognitive, lan-  
guage\) and any assistive technology \(AT\) they use.  
• Aptitude\: Their current knowledge and ability to make inferences.  
• Attitude\: Their motivation, emotion, risk tolerance, and persistence.  
Finally, we have identified some of the types of assistive technology  
they might use and ways in which they might personalize their use of  
technology.  
We hope that these personas will help you connect the technology that  
accessibility standards support with the people who benefit from its  
inclusion. Then, for example, when you think about coding for screen  
readers, you will think of Jacob, or Trevor might give you some insight  
into cognitive disabilities. Finally, we hope that the goals of the stan-  
dards will come alive through these characters.  
# Meet the Personas  
In the next pages, we’ll introduce you to the personas we created for  
this book, first in a thumbnail sketch and then in more detail. Through-  
out the chapters that follow, you will find scenarios and vignettes that  
illustrate how these personas use the web and mobile devices, giving you  
some ideas for how to design for them.

People First\: Designing for Differences 17 Trevor  
High school student with autism  
I like consistent, familiar places on the web.  
Trevor is a bright 18-year-old who plays games and watches music videos  
on his laptop. He lives at home with his parents and younger sister. He  
attends a special school where the teachers and staff can help with his  
social and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disor-  
der, while he works to pass his high school exams.  
He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the  
page, and his reading skills are not helped by his trouble concentrating  
on the page or screen long enough to read. His teachers showed him how  
to make the text bigger on the page, and told him how to use a printable  
view to hide all the ads with moving images that distract him, because he  
reads every word on the page very carefully and literally. He can be easily  
confused by colloquialisms and metaphors. He can also be overwhelmed  
by sites that offer too many choices.  
18 Chapter 2 He likes using the school’s forum to talk to his friends. It’s easier to just  
read what they want to say than to listen and try to figure out their  
facial expressions.  
He shares a laptop with the family, but has first dibs on it because his par-  
ents want him to get his schoolwork done. He uses it for homework, but he  
really likes games with repetitive actions. He doesn’t like new sites much,  
in the same way that he doesn’t like any changes in his routine\: they are  
tolerated, but not encouraged.  
Snapshot of Trevor  
• 18 years old  
• Lives with family  
• Goes to high school  
• Computers at school; laptop at home; basic mobile phone with SMS  
The A’s  
• Ability\: Autism Spectrum Disorder. Uses larger text and a program  
that hides everything but the text, so he doesn’t get distracted  
• Aptitude\: Uses the computer well for games, but doesn’t learn new  
sites easily  
• Attitude\: Prefers familiar sites in an established routine  
Assistive Technology  
• Text preference settings  
• Chat and forums  
• Power keyboard user

• 5 times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ASDs.  
• The majority do not have an intellectual disability.  
People First\: Designing for Differences 19 Emily  
Cerebral palsy, living independently  
I want to do everything for myself.  
Emily is determined to do things for herself, so she’s tried a lot of different  
keyboards and joysticks over the years, looking for the right kind of inter-  
action. Speech is difficult for her, so she uses a communications program  
with speech output.  
It’s slow for her to type with limited use of her fingers. She has stored  
many phrases and sentences, and can make the program speak for her  
more easily.  
The iPad turned out to be one of the best solutions. Mounted on the  
scooter, it’s always within reach, and touch works better than a keyboard  
and a joystick. In some situations, it can replace her older communica-  
tions program.  
Instant messaging and social media have also been great. The short  
formats work well for her, and text can be a more comfortable way to  
communicate than speech.  
20 Chapter 2 Her latest discovery is an app that scans the area to show her what shops  
and restaurants are in each direction. “I look like a dancing fool spinning  
my scooter around, but it saves me a lot of time finding someplace new.”  
Snapshot of Emily  
• 24 years old  
• Graduated from high school and working on a college degree

People First\: Designing for Differences 21 Jacob  
Blind, a bit of a geek  
The right technology lets me do anything.  
Jacob is a paralegal in a large law firm. He reviews cases and writes sum-  
maries, cross-referencing them to the firm’s own cases and clients. He’s  
building expertise in his area of law and is hoping to go to law school in a  
year or so.  
As far as Jacob is concerned, it’s the technology that’s handicapped, not  
him. When everything is in place, he can work just as fast and just as  
effectively as anyone in his office.  
He’s a bit of a gadget geek, always trying out new tools, looking for a little  
edge and something new. The last few years have been a lot of fun with all  
the new apps, and VoiceOver on his Mac and phone lets him use most of  
them pretty well. He likes the challenge of learning new tools.  
22 Chapter 2 His other challenge is running. He’s training for a 10K run, running with  
a club in his neighborhood and using an app to plan his routes and track  
his distance.  
He’s just started to use The iPhone app, Passbook, and uses it to get train  
tickets and other travel. The regional rail system has an app, so he can  
just pull up the barcode and scan it at the ticket office. No fumbling for

Living with fatigue and pain  
No one gets that this really is a disability.  
Lea was on track to become the editor of the magazine she worked for  
when she started having numbness in her hands and feeling completely  
fatigued by the middle of the afternoon. She tried medications and exercise  
and getting enough sleep, but finally she had to make a change in her life.  
She found a job where she could work from home, on her own schedule.  
When she has good days, it’s like nothing is wrong. But on bad days, she  
measures every action so she can make it through the day. Sometimes  
that important editorial meeting is all she can manage.  
24 Chapter 2 She had to adjust her computer\: a new keyboard and trackball make it  
easier to type, and a good chair helps her avoid tender muscles. The big-  
gest change was learning to write and edit using speech recognition  
software, Dragon Naturally Speaking.  
She’s lucky\: the company understands that it’s a real disability. With an  
invisible disability like fibromyalgia, some people just don’t get it.

Deaf, ASL speaker  
My only disability is that everyone doesn’t sign.  
The nice thing about being a graphic artist is that most of the time his  
work can speak for itself.  
When he first started working, most reviews were done in meetings, but  
more and more his agency works with clients using online workspaces. He’s  
had some projects recently where all of the communication was through  
the web. Although he likes seeing live reactions, it’s easier for him to par-  
ticipate in the project forum discussions using text rather than audio.  
His iPhone has also been important. It was his first phone with a good  
way to do video chat so he could talk to his friends who sign.  
It’s annoying when videos on the web aren’t captioned. How is he sup-  
posed to learn about a new app if the only information is an animated  
video? Or if he’s the only one in the office who doesn’t get the joke?  
26 Chapter 2 Like many people who learned ASL as their first language, Steven prefers  
sign, but reads text, since that’s most of what the web is. If a site is just a  
big wall of text, he’s likely to leave unless he knows it’s got the informa-

Vishnu was diagnosed with glaucoma and his eyes have been getting  
steadily worse, despite treatment. He can adjust his monitor and his phone,  
but many of the technical programs he uses don’t have many options, so he  
has started using a screen magnifier and high-contrast mode.  
Like everyone in Singapore, he has several mobile phones. One connects  
him to his family in India, one is for work, and one is for personal use.  
He’s lucky to have good bandwidth at home and at work. Some of his

Grandmother with macular degeneration  
My grandkids are dragging me into the world of technology.  
Carol has always loved reading, so her fading eyesight is a real sorrow to  
her. She tried recorded books, but she didn’t like listening instead of see-  
ing the words in front of her.  
As a bookkeeper for 25 years, she made the transition from ledgers to a  
software program, so she’s happy to use the computer. She has an old  
home computer, which she uses the same way she always did her work—  
carefully checking everything as she goes. She loves getting emails from  
her grandkids \(and a few friends\). She likes reading magazine articles  
online, especially when they are free. Last year, she discovered that she  
could get her prescriptions more cheaply online, and now she buys some  
things from the web.  
Her biggest problem is that the text is so small. She’s learned how to click  
on the symbol to make the text bigger, but is frustrated when it doesn’t  
work the same way on every site.  
She also finds that her hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, and  
she can’t always click on things accurately. She likes her “old fashioned”

users. Personas are a way to combine user research from many  
sources into realistic characters, to help you remember to put  
people first during the design process.  
This chapter introduces eight personas, differentiated by ability  
\(both physical and cognitive\), aptitude \(their knowledge and skill  
with technology\), and attitude \(their motivation, emotion, risk toler-  
ance, and persistence\).  
You will hear from these personas in the following chapters, as they  
help you to understand how different aspects of design affect the

# OXO Products  
The clarity of the design of the OXO products hides the attention to  
detail that makes them work so well.  
Some of the best examples of purposeful design come from the consumer  
products company, OXO. Most of their Good Grips line of kitchen tools sup-  
port a singular task\: boil water, peel vegetables, spin-dry lettuce. OXO’s  
products are also designed to be used by people with limited dexterity, such  
as people with arthritis, and to be comfortable and effective for people who  
are right- or left-handed.  
As an example, consider the travel mug. There are more factors to design-  
ing one than you might expect. It helps when you start by thinking about the  
purpose\: to provide a satisfying and safe drinking experience. To design the  
mug, OXO did research into the “optimal sipping volume” and determined  
the ideal size and shape to deliver a comfortable amount of hot beverage.  
In taking into account the needs of a broad spectrum of users, OXO is able to  
distill down the critical features of their products to those that are the most  
necessary and create designs that focus on those features and make their  
use seem effortless. It’s a happy moment, happening upon a product that has a clear  
purpose. These products are recognizable by their straightforward  
effectiveness, dedication to users’ goals, a direct path to the task at  
hand, and freedom from confusing clutter or extraneous elements.  
Not many products are able to stick to a singularity of purpose—it takes  
restraint on the part of the designer and the consumer. It’s easy to fall  
into the trap of creating multi-featured tools, like the Veg-O-Matic\: “It  
slices, it dices! But wait, there’s more!”  
A clear purpose helps to create designs that avoid unnecessary com-  
plexity. Guided by the goal to deliver content and functionality to the  
broadest possible audience, teams have the means to stay true to the  
product purpose and make design decisions that favor the most univer-  
sally usable approach.  
# How Clear Purpose  
# Supports Accessibility  
A clear purpose is a key to good user experience and accessibility.  
Sprawling, cluttered websites and complex, multi-layered web applica-  
tions are harder for everyone to use. By maintaining focus on essential  
features and functionality and favoring simple solutions, designs are  
better for everyone.  
With a clear purpose, people enjoy products that are designed for the  
audience and guided by a defined purpose and goals.  
• Sites can be less complex and confusing. Pages with many different  
“calls to action” and competing content can be especially difficult for  
people who have difficulty focusing or an attention deficit disorder.  
• Page layouts are clear. If the purpose is not clear, it’s hard to have a  
clean hierarchy of information in either the visual design or underly-  
ing structures. Clean layouts work better for people who use screen  
magnification software and can only see a portion of the screen at a  
time. Simpler pages are also easier for people who don’t read well or  
are reading the language of the page as a second \(or third\) language.  
• Forms and other sequential interactions make sense. Many types  
of assistive technology present web pages in a linear sequence. Lay-  
ered interactions that are not coded clearly can be difficult for people  
who are not frequent web users \(and may be less comfortable explor-  
ing\) and can be impossible for people using assistive technology  
to navigate.  
Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 37 • Accessibility can be built in. Fixing problems in a design never  
works as well as avoiding them to begin with. And fixes made late in a  
process often require changes that compromise the design. When the  
purpose is clear, design, code, usability, and accessibility can work  
together from the beginning.  
When a site is confusing, I just leave.  
My clients, most don’t speak English well,  
so I need sites that have health informa-  
Maria  
tion in Spanish, too. I can read it with  
them and make sure that they understand  
it, and that they know the words to tell  
their doctor.  
To tell you the truth, on my own, I don’t stay on a site long if it’s  
confusing. On many sites, there is so much crammed in that I  
can’t find anything at all. It just makes my head hurt to even try.  
I like the sites that are simple and don’t have so many decisions  
I have to make. When I find a site that works for me, I stick to  
it. I have a nice health site that I use most of the time. For any-  
thing else, I just search.  
# How to Design for a Clear Purpose  
Design for universal usability is an excellent way to arrive at a clear  
purpose. You can focus on necessary features, avoiding elements that  
are not essential to the product purpose. With accessible design as a  
starting point, you end up with a better product—one that has a clear  
purpose and is easier for everyone to use.  
Start with purpose and goals  
All too often, teams dive into a project without a clear idea of its purpose  
and goals. They start knowing the site will have a shopping cart, video, or  
social media, and then dive into designing the site without first knowing  
its core mission.  
When considering the purpose and goals, focus on audience goals rather  
than business goals. In most cases, using a product isn’t a goal in itself,  
so dig deeper and see what needs it will meet. For example, “use social  
media,” is not a user goal, but rather “connect with my friends,” or “let  
the world know what I’m doing,” or even “tell my family that I’m on my  
way home.”  
38 Chapter 3 The design team should be able to answer the questions, “Why does this  
website exist?” and “What value does this site provide for the people  
who use it?” It’s easy to get excited about technology ideas or get bogged  
down in lists of features. But teams that work from a shared under-  
standing of the clear purpose for a product make better decisions about  
features and functionality.  
Design for clarity and simplicity  
The digital environment is incredibly flexible—seemingly without  
boundaries. However, each new feature adds complexity and can  
adversely impact usability. And bad general usability can mean no  
usability for people with disabilities.  
Try focusing design and developmental efforts on critical aspects of  
the product—the content and functionality required for the product to  
achieve its purpose. Even when working on a complex product, look for  
ways to make it appear simple. When you can explain the purpose of the  
site or app clearly, it’s easier to choose among design options.  
Four Strategies for Simplicity  
In his book Simple and Usable, Giles Colborne identifies four strategies for  
simplicity\:  
• Remove\: Get rid of unnecessary elements until the product has only the  
essentials.  
• Organize\: Arrange the elements on the screen so that they make sense.  
• Hide\: Move any elements not essential for mainstream use so that they do not  
clutter the screen.  
• Displace\: Consider whether any elements or features can be handled off-  
screen, either in a different part of the site, on a different device, or by users  
themselves.  
www.simpleandusable.com  
Think “accessibility first”  
The best time to consider accessibility is at the start of a project when  
defining the product purpose. When accessibility is part of the purpose  
and built in from the beginning, the product works better for everyone.  
Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 39 This way of thinking may seem backward. Why start with the excep-  
tions? Historically, websites and web apps have been designed for early  
adopters, then adapted for a more general audience, and only then made  
accessible, usually imperfectly.  
When good designers shift this around, thinking about accessibility  
first, they end up with a product that is stronger and more usable for  
everyone. Considering a diverse audience is just the same as working  
in many languages or across many devices and platforms. When you  
include accessibility in your thinking from the beginning, it is just one  
more aspect of the flexibility needed for today’s products.  
Simpler screens are easier screens.  
I love having a tablet computer. It’s small  
enough to go everywhere with me. How-  
ever, being small can also mean that the  
whole page gets small and crowded, and  
that makes it harder for me to use the  
Emily  
site. I can’t tell you how often I’ve gone  
zooming off to the wrong link or couldn’t  
hit the right button. The ones I like seem to have everything in  
the right place. It’s like they read my mind and put the things I  
need on the screen when I need them.  
Designing for Mobile Helps Focus on What Matters  
As the web moved to smaller mobile devices, designers like Luke Wroblewski saw  
an opportunity to shift the paradigm and make a move toward simplicity. Web-  
sites can be flexible. You can add menus, link in new pages, and add more widgets  
pretty easily, especially compared to older software engineering. As screens got  
bigger and the Internet got faster, optimizing a site was not as big a problem. That  
led to feature creep. Instead of being even more rigorous about what is impor-  
tant enough to get space at the top of the page, pages got bigger and the text got  
smaller, to cram more onto the screen. Something had to give.  
Luke suggested that design start with “mobile first.” Instead of trying to cut down a  
large website, you can use the constraints of a small screen to make the hard deci-  
sions about how to use the precious real estate on a mobile screen. The discipline  
required to build a good mobile experience also forces you into a simpler approach  
overall, without unnecessary complexity and with important information first.  
You can see a video of Luke’s talk about his approach from the LinkedIn Tech  
Talk series at www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1137 or read his book, Mobile First.  
40 Chapter 3 Make templates accessible, too  
Templates, widgets, and toolkits are the building blocks for many web-  
sites. Even experienced developers usually start from a template or  
sample code. The effort to make templates accessible pays off every time  
they are used, and sites built from accessible templates work better  
for everyone.  
For example, WordPress is one of the largest content management sys-  
tems out there. According to wordpress.org, it’s built by a community of  
volunteers, and is used by over 25 million people to build a site or a blog.  
The default WordPress 3.0 theme was called Twenty Ten, and it looks like  
the screen in Figure 3.1.  
Like all of the WordPress themes, it’s a fully designed site that’s ready for  
an author to customize with different headers, menus, and widgets.  
FIGURE 3.1  
WordPress Twenty Ten theme\: http\://2010dev.wordpress.com/  
Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 41 Now, let’s take a look at an accessible version of Twenty Ten in Figure 3.2.  
FIGURE 3. 2  
Accessible WordPress modified Twenty Ten theme\: http\://accessible.  
sprungmarker.de/2011/01/accessible-1-0/  
For this variation \(or child theme\), the designer, Sylvia Egger, added a few  
features to make the site accessible\:  
• Accessible color contrast meeting WCAG AAA  
• Better keyboard handling with visible focus  
• Link hover and active states so it’s easier to see  
• Skip to content links at the top  
• Headings for sidebars to help identify the content  
That’s it. And you can barely tell the difference in the overall look of  
the design.  
Even better, volunteers are working to include features that support  
accessibility in the standard WordPress themes. With thousands of peo-  
ple using a theme, a few extra steps will make all the sites created with it  
work better for everyone. Because whether they need large text and high  
42 Chapter 3 contrast to read easily, use a keyboard to jump from link to link, or con-  
trol their computer with voice input, everyone comes to those sites with  
the same goals\: to read, explore, learn, or shop.  
Choose an accessibility strategy  
Accessibility is not black and white, on and off. You should aim for full  
accessibility, but when you hit roadblocks, it’s helpful to think about a  
range of approaches, listed here from most to least desirable.  
• Universal \(or inclusive\) design—one site. Everyone has the same  
means of use, with elements that work for everyone, no matter what  
interaction mode is chosen. The goal of this book is to help you create  
universal or inclusive websites and apps, so no one is left out of the  
experience. For example, a video with captions and video description  
and an accessible video player lets everyone watch the same video.  
• Equivalent use—includes alternatives. Products contain similar  
ways to meet the same goals but present them in different ways. For  
example, a transcript for an audio file has the same information, but  
someone reading the information has a different experience than  
someone listening to the audio.  
• Accommodation—a separate “accessible” version. Accommo-  
dation is disability-speak for working around a barrier without  
removing it—“separate but not equal.” Accommodations like a “text  
only” version are not acceptable. It’s not okay to create a separate  
design—one that delivers a separate and degraded experience—for  
people with disabilities.  
# Who Is Responsible for Clear Purpose?  
A clearly defined purpose forms the basis for projects and serves as a touch-  
stone throughout the project. Every member of the project team needs to be  
on board with that purpose and remain loyal to it. Design for clear purpose  
is a guiding principle through all phases of the design process.  
In his book, Brunelleschi’s Dome, Ross King describes how the Florence  
Cathedral got the largest masonry dome ever built. For 50 years, mas-  
ter builders were required to swear an oath that they would follow the  
model as they built the church, even though no one at the time had the  
slightest idea how to build a roof that large. Each master builder took up  
the challenge, solving one problem after another, until they were able to  
complete the project. That’s faith in a project vision.  
Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 43 Equivalent or Accommodation\: Easy Chirp and Twitter  
As wonderful as Twitter is, it is clear that it was not built with universal design in  
mind. Compare the Twitter client \(Figure 3.3\) with an accessible version \(Figure 3.4\).  
The Twitter website was designed for use on a large display. It puts a lot of function-  
ality in a small space. But it’s not designed or built for accessibility. Although the  
Twitter site has been redesigned several times, it’s still hard for some people to use.  
Easy Chirp takes advantage of the Twitter application programming interface \(API\)  
to create an accessible site. It’s not pretty, but Dennis Lembrée designed it for access  
by anyone, regardless of ability and using any web interface. It has all of the func-  
tionality of the Twitter website, coded so that it works with screen readers.  
The difference between these two ways of using Twitter is immediately clear. There  
are two ways to look at this from a universal design perspective.  
FIGURE 3.3  
Twitter website\:

44 Chapter 3 First, you might ask why Twitter didn’t think that it was important to work for  
screen readers. Twitter made sure that it was globalized, working in dozens of lan-  
guages. Why not make sure that it worked for screen readers?  
But you can also look at the fact that there is a robust API. There are many programs  
that help people work with Twitter in their own way. In this view, Easy Chirp is just  
another variation for people with particular needs.  
The danger of taking advantage of this “equivalent use” approach and relying on  
other programs for accessibility is that they all have to be kept up-to-date as features  
and the API change. Over time, the accessible versions can fall behind or even stop  
working entirely. This happened to Easy Chirp when Twitter changed its API in early  
2013\. As this book went to press, Dennis Lembrée announced the launch of Easy  
Chirp 2 with help from Kickstarter funders.  
What do you think?

Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 45 Summary  
A clear purpose is the starting point for any successful design. Like  
any user experience design, a clear purpose starts with understand-  
ing the audience, including people with disabilities.  
Thinking about accessibility from the beginning—“Accessibility  
First”—is similar to the approach of thinking “Mobile First” to  
ensure that the design works as well in a screen reader as it does on  
a small screen.  
There are three approaches to accessibility\:  
• Universal design aims for a website or app in which the same  
design and content elements work for everyone, no matter how  
they interact with the web.  
• Equivalent use focuses on ensuring that each mode of interac-  
tion—visual or auditory, tactile or keyboard, for example—has  
an equally good experience.  
• Accommodation is the least desirable, because it creates a sepa-  
rate—and usually unequal—experience.

*ing websites and web applications. With a rigorous practice of user*  
*research and usability testing, cxpartners creates simple, easy-to-*  
*use designs, paying particular attention to global accessibility.*  
*In his book* Simple and Usable\: Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design, *Giles*  
*teaches the art and science of achieving simplicity in interface design. We wanted*  
*to learn from Giles how accessibility can impact a simple, purposeful design*  
*approach, and vice versa.*  
Simplicity is good science and good interface design.  
Giles comes to interface design from science. As a physics student, simplicity  
was impressed on him as the mark of good science. “The whole purpose of the  
scientific endeavor is to pack reality back down into a handful of equations.” He  
credits his background for his enthusiasm for approaching a seemingly com-  
plex interface challenge and seeking the path to the simplest solution. “It doesn’t  
strike me as paradoxical, it strikes me as rather beautiful.”  
In practice, most interfaces we encounter don’t reflect Giles’ enthusiasm for sim-  
plicity. “People make software very difficult to use by loading on features.” The  
result is software that requires practice to become proficient.  
Simple designs put complexity in its place.  
In one project, Giles worked on improving the interface for a travel planner. The  
software tapped into a vast store of data, of places to see and things to do, with  
supporting details about location, time to get there, time needed to visit, and  
hours of operation. “When we put the interface together, it totally bombed. The  
app was constantly saying, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you haven’t done  
enough of this.’ It was so hard to use, and so unforgiving.”  
Giles went back to the drawing board. Rather than have the software identify  
possible options, he had users create lists of locations and places that were of  
interest to them. The computer didn’t try to work out whether or not the itinerary  
was practical—it gave people enough data to figure it out themselves.  
People are good at imagining the future. Computers are good at remembering  
stuff. By handing off the task of imagining to the user and the task of remem-  
bering to the computer, it all worked out. The process taught me a powerful  
lesson about where complexity belongs, who should own it.

Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals 47 Profile\: Simple and Usable with Giles Colborne \(continued\)  
Observe real people to learn what’s needed.  
Giles’ practice is informed by user research. “You can’t make safe predictions about  
how things are going to work until you engage with the audience.” And that means  
engaging with real people, not through imagined personas or user stories.  
People fall in love with pen portraits of their users. Not their real users—the users  
they’d like to have\: young, attractive, happy, active, outdoorsy, not distracted, com-  
pletely able-bodied. When you bring real users to the testing and design process, the  
reality is that there’s much more variability.  
Giles finds that some of the greatest insights come from studying how people work in  
extreme circumstances. For one project, Giles researched how people with ADHD manage  
their condition as a way of understanding more broadly how to design for distracted users.  
Everyone operates under some kind of duress that degrades their performance,  
and yet we design stuff in nice quiet offices and reflect on the design and interface  
and take a long time discussing something that a user needs to do in a fraction of  
a second.  
Giles does international testing, which also yields insights that resonate with acces-  
sibility. A design that can adapt from English to Chinese must handle enlarged text, so  
small details in the characters are legible. “That flexibility in presentation is at the core  
of what you’re thinking about when you’re thinking about designing for accessibility.”  
Designing for multiple devices supports accessibility.  
Giles has seen significant change in how design is done, due to the diversity of devices.  
Instead of detailed wireframes and mock-ups, now he starts with information hier-  
archies. Instead of creating Photoshop mock-ups, prototypes are done in code, with  
designs and layouts that respond to different viewports. This change in practice may  
move us closer to designs that are simple and usable, for everyone.  
As soon as you start to think about how navigation appears on a small screen, you  
start to focus on information hierarchies that also work well for accessibility. On  
a small screen, you don’t want navigation, and then you scroll down and there’s  
content. You want content, and then scroll down and there’s navigation. And, of  
course, that’s what you want for a screen reader as well. This discipline of design-  
ing for multiple platforms and environments makes you start to think in useful ways  
about accessibility.

# Solid Ramps and Infuriating Ramps  
Two wheelchair ramps show the value of good structure and building  
to standards.  
Personal experience provides cues as to whether a physical structure is built  
well or looks unsafe because of obvious construction details, such as where  
the structure is placed or how it feels under our feet.  
Wheelchair ramps provide a lot of examples of both obvious structural  
integrity and ramps that make you wonder what their designers were think-  
ing. You can see the difference between the two in the illustration on this  
page\: the one on the right suggests a solid structure, while the one on the left  
looks ramshackle, difficult, and dangerous.  
The digital environment does not currently have an equivalent to the  
rigorous building codes and legal requirements of civil engineering and  
architecture. As we all come to appreciate the impact of digital products on  
health, safety, and general welfare, we are likely to see more interest in stan-  
dards and certification in this area. When navigating the physical environment—public spaces in  
particular—we take structural integrity for granted. As a  
rule, we don’t usually have to think about whether the entry  
ramp at a building will collapse. In fact, we assume that it was designed  
and built to specifications, and that the people responsible for safety  
have set requirements that will make the ramp safe, sound, and acces-  
sible. However, when we see cues that this is not the case, we worry.  
For websites and applications, “structural integrity” means software  
that does not break or have system failures. It also means a site that does  
not break in all its different contexts of use, including all the ways that  
users can customize their own experiences. For universal design, a site  
with a solid structure is one that does not create barriers in how it is  
constructed, but can be used by everyone.  
Master builders know that crafting each element with care—even  
things that are never seen or directly experienced—is important. Qual-  
ity and stability depend on care and precision at all levels. Taking this  
same approach with the code beneath the surface of a website or web  
application makes for a more stable design. It also has an impact on  
accessibility, because the way that code is written can dictate the quality  
of the user experience.  
# How Solid Structure  
# Supports Accessibility  
Although websites are created for people, every web page requires code.  
Tim Berners-Lee conceived the Internet as “a web of data that can be  
processed directly or indirectly by machines.”1 Machine-readable data is  
what makes the web so powerful.  
Programming instructions and markup add a layer of information by  
describing the content of the site and providing instructions for interac-  
tion. For example, HTML heading tags instruct software that the text  
element is a heading that describes the subsequent section.  
Machine-readable data with instructions for its use paves the way for  
assistive technology—software and hardware that transform and adapt  
websites and web applications for different modes of use.  
With a solid structure, people feel confident using the design because  
it is stable, robust, and secure.  
1 Berners-Lee, T. Weaving the Web. HarperCollins, New York, NY, 1999.  
Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 51 • Sites work across devices and technologies. To work correctly,  
assistive technology has to be able to accurately read the underly-  
ing code to identify and communicate all of the features of a website  
or web application to the user. Standards-based code that adheres to  
accessibility guidelines improves accuracy.  
People routinely use websites on different devices—from large  
screens to tiny ones, and on different operating systems—from Win-  
dows to iOS. Assistive technology is just another device. People also  
interact with sites in different ways. Touch, keyboard, audio, and  
speech are all useful at different times. A strong structure allows con-  
sistency and flexibility across devices and interaction modes so that  
everyone has an equitable experience.  
• Sites are more trustworthy. Even though the underlying structures  
are not always immediately visible, like good bone structure, they  
show up in the “skin” of the user experience. People with disabilities  
encounter so many broken experiences that they may be hesitant to  
even try a site that doesn’t have clear signs that it is structured to sup-  
port assistive technology.  
• User needs and preferences are met. No matter how well you do  
your design research, you cannot design for every person in every sit-  
uation. When the product is designed to be flexible, it allows users to  
customize the display and interaction without breaking the design.  
This makes it possible to do my job.  
They say that on the Internet, no one  
knows who you are. That’s really true for  
me. I think there are people in my com-  
pany who don’t know I’m blind—they only  
see me through email or the case sum-  
Jacob  
maries I write. When a site works with my  
screen reader, I have control over my own  
experience. I can preview the content on the page by listening  
to all the headings on the page. I’m confident I know I’m put-  
ting the right information in the right field on a form. Best of  
all, I’m no different from anyone else—and I’m faster than some  
of my co-workers, if you want to know the truth.  
When a website is not accessible, or I run into broken links or  
forms, it’s really frustrating. Sometimes I miss important infor-  
mation because it’s hidden from my screen reader. Or I have to  
spend a lot of time figuring out what’s going on. I just want to be  
able to do things for myself, and when sites are broken, I can’t.  
52 Chapter 4 How to Create a Solid Structure  
The web can be very forgiving, allowing sites with sloppy code to func-  
tion … sort of. But those sites aren’t very robust and may only work with  
specific browsers. Paying attention to the underlying code so that it works  
well for both people and other technology is the key to strong sites.  
Code content to be machine-readable  
Web accessibility relies on the software’s ability to read and understand  
the content and instructions contained in web pages. When the code  
includes all the markup and tags to communicate meaning accurately,  
the information on the page is programmatically determinable, and a  
browser or other device can read and act on it.  
Elements in a web experience that the software cannot read produce  
barriers, which are indecipherable and therefore inaccessible. The more  
“meta” information you can provide, the better the user experience will  
be, since software can do more with information it can parse and act on  
\(see Figure 4.1\).

Code to standards  
Coding standards are the building codes of the digital environment.  
They provide the tested and approved specifications that allow websites  
to work across different versions of browsers and different devices. With-  
out standards, we would have the chaos of the early years of the web, in  
which every browser worked differently, so websites were full of “hacks”  
to make them work. The result was inconsistency and instability—web-  
sites that looked fine in one browser and a mess in another.  
The choice for the developer is either to code browser- and platform-  
specific versions or exclude visitors who arrive using a non-preferred  
system. \(“This site is best viewed using Internet Explorer for Windows.”\)  
Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 53 This chaos is not good for websites in general, but it’s really bad for  
accessibility.  
You may be already coding to standards. If so, you are well on the way to  
creating accessible sites and applications. If you aren’t, or if your devel-  
opment tools don’t help you produce compliant code, now would be a  
good time to start. Table 4.1 shows the most relevant coding standards  
and guidelines for accessible web sites.

Coding to standards means writing accurate code that passes valida-  
tion for the appropriate technology standards, including HTML and  
CSS. An automated accessibility validation check against web accessi-  
bility guidelines can help identify coding issues that affect accessibility.  
However, accessibility has many subjective aspects that cannot be fully  
tested by software. You can use accessibility checkers as a tool, but you  
54 Chapter 4 should not rely on the results to ensure accessibility. \(See the list of vali-  
dation tools in Appendix C, “More Reading,” and in Provide tools and  
assistive technology for ongoing evaluation in Chapter 11, “In Practice.”\)  
There are two organizations that provide important support and guide-  
lines and best practices to help ensure that sites have a solid structure.  
Web Accessibility Initiative \(WAI\)\: A project of the Worldwide Web  
Consortium \(W3C\). WAI produces guidelines for accessible websites and  
web applications, notably\:  
• Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\)  
• WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite  
WAI also produces guidelines for software that accesses websites and  
web applications, and for software used to build sites and apps\:  
• User Agent Accessibility Guidelines \(UAAG\) for web browsers and  
media players  
• Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines \(ATAG\) for software that  
creates websites  
• A new WAI project, IndieUI \(Independent User Interface\), is work-  
ing to create a device-independent way to communicate user actions,  
such as scrolling, to a web application.  
Using W3C and WAI guidelines and techniques is a roadmap for build-  
ing accessible websites and web applications \(www.w3.org/wai\).  
The Web Standards Project \(WaSP\)\: An advocacy group of leading  
designers and developers “fighting for standards that ensure simple,  
affordable access to web technologies for all.” For its 15 years, WaSP  
had a significant impact in getting browser software to do away with  
custom code and instead support standard technologies, which in  
turn has allowed developers to code to standards. This project shut  
down in March 2013, saying that its work was done, and it was time for  
everyone to ensure that the web remains free, open, and interoperable  
\(www.webstandards.org\).  
Use standard web technologies  
In addition to coding to standards, it’s important that you select the  
right technologies to use. A sure sign of structural integrity is the ability  
to function in different contexts and on different devices. If you use tech-  
nologies that aren’t widely supported, your product won’t work in many  
situations, causing problems for all users. For example, if your product is  
Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 55 coded in Flash, people using an iPad or iPhone will only see a box indi-  
cating content that is not supported in Apple iOS.  
Look for technologies that are widely supported by browsers and assis-  
tive technologies, without the need for plug-ins. If you find yourself  
planning to use a technology that requires a plug-in, such as Flash, Flex,  
Silverlight, or QuickTime, you might be able to implement the function-  
ality more simply using standard web technologies. \(See “Guidelines for  
Rich Internet Applications in Flex, Flash, and Silverlight” in Chapter 5,  
“Easy Interaction.”\)  
Organize code for clarity and flow  
In visual design, pay attention to where elements appear, featuring impor-  
tant information prominently, near the top, and putting more incidental  
information at the bottom of a design. Location matters in visual commu-  
nications, along with other factors such as size, color, and alignment.  
In source code, order, or the sequence of elements in the code, influ-  
ences how software reads a page and, in turn, how well software conveys  
information to the user. Web browsers generally—and screen readers, in  
particular—start reading at the top of a page and read through the code  
sequentially. The order of the source code makes a difference to search  
engines, too. They treat headings and information at the top of the page  
as more relevant. If it’s more important, of course, it’s at the beginning  
of the page!  
Coding is as much a craft as any other kind of writing. To craft readable  
code, you can organize the code in an inverted pyramid so that the most  
important content and functionality is at the beginning of the file, near  
the top of the page code. Content that appears “above the fold” in code  
will be what gets read first by the software \(see Figure 4.2\).  
You should also make sure that the sequence of related elements is not  
broken by unrelated elements. Consider how elements that are closely  
related are sequenced. For example, a label for a text input field should  
appear in the code before its input element \(as well as being connected  
to it by using the label tag\), and an image caption should appear in the  
code after its image.  
Provide accessible instructions and feedback in Chapter 5 covers sequenc-  
ing and how it affects interaction. For solid structure, you should code  
important information first and follow a logical, unbroken flow.  
56 Chapter 4 FIGURE 4. 2  
Wikipedia puts the page content in the code before the top and side  
navigation, where assistive technology can read it first. http\://en.wikipedia.org/  
wiki/Jelly\_bean  
Sectioning markup is a way of associating a group of elements program-  
matically and then giving them a label. When the purpose and function  
of elements is encoded into a page, software can use that information  
to, for example, move focus between different sections, or jump directly  
to one section, such as navigation or search. HTML, HTML5, and WAI-  
ARIA provide markup that allows you to draw a virtual bounding box  
around a group of elements and label their relatedness in the code. For  
example, the HTML \<fieldset\> tag allows you to identify and label a  
group of form elements as “Contact Information.”  
You can use sectioning markup for main sections of the page, such as  
the HTML5 \<nav\> tag or the ARIA attribute role=”navigation” to mark  
site navigation. Be sure to use sectioning markup wherever possible  
to improve the readability and navigability of your code. \(Table 4.2  
and Provide clear landmarks within the page in Chapter 6, “Helpful  
Wayfinding,” have more details on using sectioning markup.\)

Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 57 Use stylesheets to separate  
content and presentation  
The architecture of a web page has two layers\: content—the text, images,  
tables, lists, and so on—and presentation, which includes the color,  
font, layout, and so on. The content layer is typically contained in the  
HTML code.  
The correct standards way of specifying the presentation layer is with  
Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\). Using CSS, all of the information about  
how to present the page is stored in a separate file, which can be used by  
many web pages. There are two advantages to using stylesheets\:  
• The separation of content and presentation generally simplifies cod-  
ing. The HTML can be clean, without being cluttered, with display  
instructions. Changes to the presentation can be implemented across  
multiple pages by changing the central CSS document.  
• The site can adjust to different displays or screen sizes, either with  
alternative presentations in the stylesheet, or by substituting one that  
is more appropriate for the display. Print stylesheets, for example, can  
set up a page for printing. Using a stylesheet also makes it possible to  
customize the presentation without breaking the site. Users can set  
their own colors, font size, or layout to match their own preferences  
or visual needs.  
The customization enabled by using CSS can be as simple as making the  
text larger, or as extreme as a whole new look. Figure 4.3 shows how one  
site can have very different looks. We’ll look at the presentation layer in  
detail in Chapter 7, “Clean Presentation.”  
Use semantic markup for content  
Semantic markup makes information meaningful to software. And when  
software can read and make sense of information, wonderful things hap-  
pen for those of us who use the software. Take search, for example.  
Search engine software reads and catalogs a document based on deter-  
minations about subject and focus. It reads the title as a strong indication  
of the topic of the page, and it gives text tagged as headings more weight  
than other text. The inclusion of these semantic tags, \<title\> and \<h1...6\>,  
improves the software’s accuracy in cataloging, which, in turn, improves  
your ability to find what you are looking for when using search.

Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 59 FIGURE 4.4  
List of headings from the JAWS screen reader. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly\_bean  
Headings are particularly important, because most screen readers  
provide a helpful list of headings on a page so that users can use  
them to navigate the hierarchy of information. In the 2012 WebAIM  
survey of people who used screen readers \(webaim.org/projects/  
screenreadersurvey4/\), 61% reported that the first thing they did on  
a page was to scan the headings using the navigation tools in their  
assistive technology.  
Figure 4.4 shows an example of the list of headings for a Wikipedia page  
in the JAWS screen reader. Notice in this example that many headings  
begin with “\[edit\].” This is because Wikipedia has coded the section  
edit link within the heading tag, with the unfortunate result that the  
headings are difficult to scan. Chapter 7 has more about writing good,  
scannable links and headings.  
Semantic markup describes the purpose of individual elements in the  
information \(a paragraph, a heading, a citation, a quote\) or group-related  
elements \(a set of form fields, a table of data\). By reflecting organization  
and meaning in the code structure, semantic tags make content stronger  
and easier for browsers and assistive technology to read.  
For example, marking text with the emphasis tag \(\<em\>\) communicates the  
importance of the words, just as changes in the visual presentation do.  
Semantic markup communicates meaning, but does not specify the  
presentation.  
\<em\>Never\</em\> put your hands in the blender \<em\>while it is  
turned on\</em\>.

We’ll look at writing content for accessibility in more depth in Chapter 8,  
“Plain Language.”  
# Who Is Responsible for  
# a Solid Structure?  
Structural integrity is primarily the responsibility of the people who  
write the code that produces the website or web application. Although  
this layer is invisible to most users, the underlying code has a profound  
impact on accessibility.  
But the entire team plays a part, right from the beginning, by think-  
ing about how each decision affects the ability to code to standards.  
As the design begins to take shape in the form of sketches, models, and  
wireframes, take the time to consider whether the emerging user experi-  
ence concepts lend themselves to coding to standards, and thus to good  
accessibility for your users.  
Taking the time at the beginning to consider the impact of technical  
decisions will result in fewer problems later in the project when struc-  
tural flaws are more difficult and costly to repair.  
# WCAG 2.0 and Solid Structure  
The guidelines for Solid Structure relate to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
Solid structure makes the site Robust, coded so that it can be read  
by a variety of browsers and other technologies for accessing the web,  
including assistive technologies. It is also Perceivable because content  
structure and relationships can be read by technology. \(Robust and Per-  
ceivable are two of the four foundational POUR principles for the Web  
Content Accessibility Guidelines, described in Chapter 1.\)

presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be pro-  
grammatically determined \(Level A\).

# Summary  
A solid structure depends on good coding practice. A site coded to  
standards, with all information written to be machine-readable,  
supports use of the site by different browsers or devices, including  
assistive technology.  
• Pages are organized so that when code is read in the order it  
appears in the file, it not only makes sense, but it puts the most  
important information first.  
• Stylesheets separate content from presentation, using code to  
communicate semantic meaning, such as content structure,  
emphasis, or function, as well as visual style.  
• A site with solid structure does not create barriers in how it is  
constructed, so people can feel confident using it.  
62 Chapter 4 Profile\: Accessibility Standards with Mike Paciello  
Mike Paciello has been a leader in promoting information and com-  
munication technology accessibility since the 1980s. He helped  
launch the Web Accessibility Initiative \(WAI\) and worked on both  
WAI and U.S. Section 508 standards.  
He’s also the founder and president of The Paciello Group \(TPG\), a  
consultancy working with software companies to make their prod-  
ucts accessible. We wanted to learn from Mike about the making of accessibility  
standards, and whether future iterations might be more “user-friendly.”  
An early commitment to people and technology.  
From early in his career, Mike saw technology as a powerful enabler, and was  
compelled to make that potential available to everyone. “I feel an incredible obli-  
gation and responsibility to people—particularly, people with disabilities—and  
to technology.”  
Beginning to explore accessible electronic documents.  
One of Mike’s first projects was acting as the liaison between DEC and the National  
Braille Press, where he learned how much work it took to make documents acces-  
sible to the blind. To convert the DEC software manual to braille, people retyped  
the text into a “braille typewriter” of sorts, and the text was then printed. “It would  
take them a year to produce one book.” The typical DEC documentation usually  
spanned several volumes and was regularly updated. “I asked, why not convert  
everything electronically? But they said there was no way to do that.”  
How to make large, complex documents usable and accessible generally, and spe-  
cifically, how to provide usability to blind and low vision users? Mike started to  
explore electronic document accessibility right around the birth of the web.  
Markup languages bring meaning to electronic documents.  
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Mike started working with SGML. “I thought, how  
about we use a markup language on an electronic document, and then a braille  
translator can read the markup language and produce braille?” He also realized  
that accessibility for blind and low vision users meant more than braille—that  
large text and listening to text were also commonly used, and a markup language  
had the potential of providing accessibility in those contexts as well.  
At the first World Congress on Accessibility in 1991, Mike joined forces with col-  
leagues to create the International Committee for Accessible Document Design  
\(ICADD\). This group created the first international specification for accessible  
electronic documents, ICADD-22, which was to become an important contribution  
to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and accessibility elements in HTML.  
profile continues on next page  
Solid Structure\: Built to Standards 63 Profile\: Accessibility Standards with Mike Paciello \(continued\)  
A pioneer for web accessibility.  
In 1995, Mike launched WebABLE, the first website dedicated to web accessibil-  
ity for people with disabilities. When the Worldwide Web Consortium started  
up, Mike got involved, creating the accessibility pages for the W3C. He and other  
accessibility colleagues started an informal W3C working group called the  
Web Accessibility Project, focused on integrating accessibility into HTML. “The  
groundwork we started back then ultimately became what most people know as  
the first Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.”  
Even this early, Mike could see the lines blurring between the web and software  
and wanted to improve accessibility for both. “I was convinced that eventually  
everything on the desktop was going to move to the web—imagine that.”  
Eventually, Jim Miller and Tim Berners-Lee asked Mike to help create a more  
formal and extensive accessibility effort within the W3C. “The conversation went  
something like, ‘We’ve been contacted by the federal government and asked to  
consider creating a formalized program in the W3C to deal with accessibility  
and disabilities. We would like you to do it. Are you interested?’”  
Helping set standards for web accessibility.  
In 2006, the Access Board asked Mike to co-chair an Advisory Committee to  
update U.S. federal accessibility regulations. He and Jim Tobias led the effort,  
which covered both Section 255, or the Disabled Persons’ Telecommunications  
Access Act, and Section 508, accessibility for electronic and information technol-  
ogy. The committee was composed of representatives of 41 organizations, from  
disability groups and technology companies \(including the Usability Professionals’  
Association\), and included participants from Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.  
Working on the new guidelines, “We turned it from a product-based standard  
into a characteristic-based standard, so it would be completely platform neu-  
tral.” In addition, they broadened the guidelines to include themes from usability  
and interoperability, and to address cognitive disabilities. In April 2008, the  
group presented the new, improved Section 508 to the Access Board. Since 2013,  
the new rules are working their way through the federal rule-making process.  
From Mike’s perspective, the current process of creating technology and legal  
standards is flawed. “It takes years for the formalization and acceptance of  
standards.” He advocates a rolling process, where elements can be added and  
changed more readily to keep the standards viable. But Mike is hopeful about  
the potential impact of the new Section 508. Awareness about accessibility is at  
an all-time high, as is government recognition of the need for accessibility stan-  
dards. Mike predicts that once the Section 508 standards become law, they will  
be used as “the model for all other major government mandates worldwide.”

# EZ Access on Amtrak Ticket Machine  
Many people use these Amtrak ticketing machines and never notice  
the EZ Access options, but they are there for those who need them.  
Source\: http\://trace.wisc.edu/ez/  
There’s very little as fundamental to independence as being able to get  
around on your own, without needing assistance. For many people, getting  
around means using kiosks to purchase tickets. For trains, buses, subways …  
touchscreen kiosks are everywhere. But how do you use one if you are blind?  
Enter EZ Access, designed at the Trace Center. By adding tactile buttons and  
an audio interface, EZ Access makes touchscreens easy to operate for every-  
one, including people who can’t see.  
Even better, the EZ Access features are unobtrusive—they are available for  
those who need them, but do not get in the way of those who don’t. The ultimate design “fail” is a website or app that people can’t get  
to work. By contrast, everyone loves sites that are easy to operate  
and whose interaction feels intuitive. They can use them success-  
fully with any device or assistive technology, and the site makes them  
feel confident and capable.  
One way to think of interaction failures is as “I can’t” moments\: “I can’t  
figure out how to submit this form.” “I can’t select this menu item.” “I  
can’t figure out how to enter my phone number in the right format.”  
As users, we want—and hope for—interfaces that are self-explanatory,  
guiding us as effortlessly as possible. The controls should be easy to  
understand and use, which leads to “I can” moments.  
Creating websites and web applications that people can use might seem  
like a no-brainer, but it’s not an easy task. With the myriad technologies  
that can be used for building, different devices and software for access-  
ing, different modes of interaction, different user needs and preferences,  
it’s a complex environment for creating sites and apps that don’t break.  
And then there’s the pace of change!  
# How Easy Interaction  
# Supports Accessibility  
In Chapter 4, “Solid Structure,” we talked about the importance of pro-  
ducing websites and web applications that software, including assistive  
technology, can read. Now, we’ll look at how people interact with web-  
sites, and what is needed for accessibility.  
Interfaces can be difficult to operate using standard tools, never mind  
specialized technologies. For web accessibility, easy interaction must  
take into account different needs.  
Don’t make me work so hard.  
I love my keyboard. I tried dozens until I  
found one that fits my hands perfectly, so  
I hardly have to move to type. Maybe you  
think I’m a bit over the top, but it makes  
a difference for me by the end of the day.  
Lea  
Using a mouse takes more energy than  
you think, and I have to conserve mine if  
I’m going to make it through the day. So do me a favor and let  
me use my keyboard for everything. OK?  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 67 With easy interaction, people can use the product across all modes of  
interaction and operating with a broad range of devices.  
• Sites don’t create barriers, or sites make barriers easy to overcome.  
The worst barriers keep someone from using a site at all. A few years  
ago, there was a debate about whether interactive worlds like Second  
Life were accessible. Many people with disabilities used them, both  
for the general enjoyment and because the interactive environment  
made their disability invisible. Even for blind users, it turned out that  
the most inaccessible part of the interface—the one that kept them  
from using Second Life at all—was the sign-in screen! \(Second Life has  
since fixed this problem, marking up the sign-in form correctly.\) Even  
small barriers can drive a user away. These are the sites that “sort of  
work” if you can just figure out how to get around the speed bumps  
of things like confusing markup or navigation. As Clayton Lewis put  
it, “Many barriers to cognitive accessibility are the same as usability  
problems for a general user audience … but more severe.”  
• Designs work for people. When things work well, we hardly notice  
them. That’s why bad designs are so annoying and frustrating.  
CAPTCHA1 is an example of a perfect storm of bad interaction—  
hard for everyone to use, not just people with disabilities. CAPTCHAs  
try to make sure that a real person \(rather than software\) is filling  
out a form, so they display a code word in distorted letters. The  
idea is that robots or other software can’t read the letters, even  
using character recognition. To make them accessible, CAPTCHAs  
can include a distorted audio version that is also supposed to be  
undecipherable by software. Unfortunately, both the visual and  
audio distortions are difficult for many people, even with good  
eyesight or hearing. People may have difficulty separating sounds  
from background noise or spelling words with difficult letter  
combinations. Ironically, CAPTCHAs aren’t even very effective—  
a spammer can pay for keys to break them for under a penny each.  
• People can choose their own way to interact with a site. Some  
disabilities impact dexterity, making it difficult to respond quickly  
or to operate some kinds of controls. For example, some people work  
best with tactile controls—buttons and other controls they can feel—  
while others work best with pointing devices. All of this adds up to  
1 CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers  
and Humans Apart, but they can be so frustrating that Jared Smith from WebAIM  
suggests it should mean Completely Automated Patience Test to Confuse the Hell  
out of your Audience.  
68 Chapter 5 giving people the ability and means to control their own environ-  
ment, the time and space to work at their own pace in their own way,  
and the software and hardware that works best for them.  
# Designing for Easy Interaction  
Success in interaction design is largely a matter of following established  
patterns, so people can apply what they already know to new contexts.  
Using known and well-established interactive controls goes a long way in  
designing for easy interaction. There are specific considerations that will  
help make controls more usable for people using assistive technologies.  
And there are design considerations that make interaction more usable  
and enjoyable for everyone, including people with disabilities.  
Identify and describe interactive elements  
Interactive elements should be easy to distinguish from other elements  
on the page. For example, links and buttons can be identified in the fol-  
lowing ways\:  
• Visually. Links are often colored and underlined, and buttons are  
identifiable by shape.  
• In code. Link and button markup codes distinguish these elements,  
making it possible for browsers to identify them.  
• Through interaction. Links and buttons can show their state, such  
as when they are active, through changes in their appearance. They  
can also be accessed through the keyboard or in lists of interactive  
elements constructed by assistive technology.  
Between HTML, WAI-ARIA, and features of the technology platform,  
there are many options for providing accessible interactivity by using  
code to identify and describe interactive elements.  
Use basic HTML codes correctly  
In addition to coding interactive components, you can also describe  
their function programmatically. HTML has codes that help software  
communicate information about components to users.  
With basic HTML, interaction is limited to links and form controls.  
The codes you use to provide interaction include the attributes needed  
to make the elements accessible. Implementing those elements fully,  
according to specification, goes far in providing accessible interactiv-  
ity. Take, for example, a label for a text input field, as shown in Figure 5.1.  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 69 Visually, the label is related by proximity, usually appearing right before  
the field. In code, the label is related using the \<label for\> element and  
attribute, which programmatically connects the label with the input  
field. That way software can tell the user which type of information to  
enter into the field.  
FIGURE 5.1  
Labels are visually  
associated by prox-  
imity with text input  
fields. In code, labels  
are programmatically  
connected using the  
\<label\> element, the  
“for” attribute, and  
the input field’s “id”  
attribute making the  
connection.  
\<label for=”firstname”\>First name\:\</label\>  
\<input type=”text” id=”firstname” /\>  
\<label for=”lastname”\>Last name\:\</label\>  
\<input type=”text” id=”lastname” /\>  
Use WAI-ARIA for complex elements  
Until recently, there was not the same built-in accessible support for  
complex, page-level interaction as there is for links and forms. But that is  
finally changing. With WAI-ARIA, you can identify and describe interac-  
tive elements in a way that software can read, so it is accessible to users  
of assistive technology.  
For example, one interaction pattern is the “accordion” widget, which  
is a link that, when clicked, expands to show hidden content \(see Fig-  
ure 5.2\). Clicking a second time collapses the content back to its hidden  
state. This pattern is helpful for content that may not be relevant to all  
users. It saves precious screen real estate, and also provides a way to  
learn more in context, without jumping to different pages or scrolling  
through one long page.  
ARIA provides codes you can use to identify and describe interactive  
components like an accordion widget programmatically so that assis-  
tive technology can communicate information about the component  
to users. For example, in the case of an accordion widget, the “aria-  
expanded” attribute can be set programmatically to “true” or “false,”  
depending on the state of the component.  
70 Chapter 5 FIGURE 5. 2

Alliance \(www.oaa-

provides examples and  
downloadable code for  
many common design  
patterns, including an  
accessible accordion  
widget. \(www.oaa-  
accessibility.org/  
examplep/accordian1/\)  
ARIA is helpful for other interactions as well. For example, in the sample  
sign-up form, shown in Figure 5.3, error messages are coded with the  
attribute role=”alert” so that the helpful in-line error messages can be  
announced to screen reader users.  
FIGURE 5.3  
In this sample account sign-up form, alerts are identified program-  
matically using the ARIA role attribute.  
Use features of the technology platform  
When you are coding elements using programming other than HTML,  
you should use the features of the technology to fully identify and  
describe interactive elements. For the most part, technologies like Flash  
and Java have the necessary hooks for accessibility. Those who develop  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 71 Guidelines for Rich Internet Applications in Flex, Flash, and Silverlight  
The websites for financial service companies often include complex financial infor-  
mation, including real-time data, price charts, and information to help investors  
manage their money. The guidelines below are excerpted from Ann Chadwick-Dias  
and Marguerite Bergel’s work with product development teams to make sure that  
their applications are accessible, especially for older customers managing their  
retirement funds.  
1\. 2. 3. Clearly indicate and manage focus.  
• Ensure users can visually track their focus when keyboard navigating.  
• Shift focus into layers as they open; return focus to the originating link  
once closed.  
• Keep users’ focus on controls as they operate them \(expand/collapse toggle\).  
Help users know where to begin and reinforce where they are.  
• Use style changes for selected menu items, buttons, and visited links in con-  
tent pages.  
• Add a button that simulates the browser’s Back button, if needed.  
• Mirror the page’s information hierarchy in the code using proper  
semantic markup.  
Clearly indicate what is interactive and how to interact with it.  
• Offer clear instructions or demos, where appropriate.  
• Change cursors and styles for interactive controls on hover.  
• Use active terminology on interactive elements.  
• Use ARIA to communicate custom controls’ role and state to assistive  
technologies.  
using these tools just need to use them correctly and to design so it is  
possible to code the interaction accessibly.  
But you should consider the ramifications carefully before moving away  
from standard technologies. Is the interaction necessary to the purpose  
and goals of the product? If so, can you accomplish what’s needed using  
standard coding? Exhaust the possibility of using standard web technol-  
ogies before you make a commitment to a non-standard, and therefore  
less stable and accessible format.  
Provide accessible instructions and feedback  
In Chapter 4, Organize code for clarity and flow, we discussed how some  
modes of interaction rely on linearized access, and the code order  
72 Chapter 5 4\. Progressively reveal content.  
• Draw attention to changes \(fading colored backgrounds, data loading  
indicators\).  
• Change content downstream of users’ focus.  
• Use ARIA live regions to announce updated content to assistive  
technologies.  
5\. Design forgiving controls and inputs.  
• Use large click, grab, tap, drop targets. Wrap supporting icons in adjacent  
text links.  
6. • Don’t make controls too sensitive, requiring fine motor control.  
• Add redundant text entry fields next to sliders.  
Let users control movement on the page.  
• Don’t auto-play A/V content or loop animations users can’t control.  
• Warn users in advance if links launch A/V content.  
7\. Respect users’ settings.  
• Make fonts responsive to browsers’ text size controls \(e.g., IE’s  
View\>Text Size\).  
• Ensure that content wraps and containers adjust as font sizes scale.  
• Don’t override color display settings users set in their browser or  
operating system.  
matters because it affects the order in which elements are presented.  
For example, the audio mode of a screen reader cannot present more  
than one piece of information or interactive option at a time. Interactive  
elements that are not sequenced correctly can create barriers for every-  
one, but especially for people relying on a linear presentation.  
It’s not the details of the interaction itself that create the barrier, but  
how it is structured in the code and presented to users. A simple rule of  
thumb is to design the page so that any changes made after it loads the  
first time happen “downstream” of the cursor.  
The location in the code makes a real difference to the accessibility of  
forms and error messages. For example, as a user fills in a form, the code  
checks each entry to be sure it is valid. It might check to see if a username  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 73 is available. But, if feedback is displayed above the field, the assistive tech-  
nology doesn’t see the change, and it simply proceeds to the next field.  
Even worse, some forms display error messages in a “modal” pop-up  
window that requires the user to close the window before correcting the  
errors. With the error messages no longer displayed, the user must try to  
remember the list of problems while looking for the fields to correct.  
Or it could be that, after a user submits a form, software on the server  
identifies a problem with the submitted data and redisplays the form so  
the errors can be corrected. In some cases, the program positions the  
cursor in the field in question. Unfortunately, the error message is dis-  
played at the top of the page. Not only will assistive technology not see  
this message, but most users won’t see it either.  
So as you are designing forms, you should make sure that any interactive  
feedback appears both in the code and on-screen in a way that makes  
sense when linearized. Most often, this means putting the inserted  
feedback after the element, so it is the next thing in the tab and reading  
order, as well as marking it with an ARIA role, as shown in the sample  
sign-up form in Figure 5.3.  
Sequencing also matters for instructions. Sometimes, forms are coded  
so that instructions and labels appear after the form fields and buttons.  
Users \(and assistive technology\) have to read ahead to determine the  
purpose of each field and then backtrack to fill in the field. Be sure that  
the elements in a form follow a logical sequence\: identify and describe an  
element before the interaction, both visually and in the code.  
Instructions and labels that appear inside the field are problematic because  
they disappear when the field is activated. Users who need to look at the  
keyboard as they type will miss the hint entirely. Others won’t remember the  
details in the instructions and labels once they are no longer displayed.  
I don’t understand what the screen  
is saying.  
I love seeing photos of my grandchildren,  
particularly since they live so far away. My  
granddaughter set up a place where she  
can put up pictures and notes for me. I was  
Carol  
excited, but it took me three tries and a  
phone call to get me connected. I thought  
I filled in all the answers correctly, but the same questions kept  
appearing. I’m sure that program was trying to tell me what to  
do, but I just couldn’t understand what the screen was saying.  
74 Chapter 5 Support keyboard interaction  
The point-and-click interaction model popularized by the mouse is  
not universally usable. Nonvisual users cannot see to point the mouse.  
People with dexterity issues may find mouse operations awkward and  
cumbersome. Some alternative input devices work by activating key-  
board commands instead. Also, some people find keyboard control  
easier, more comfortable, and more efficient than pointing.  
Provide a logical tab order  
In Chapter 4, we talked about how the code order affects linear access  
to web pages in Organize code for clarity and flow. Code order has a sig-  
nificant impact on keyboard navigation, especially when using the tab  
key to cycle through actionable elements \(interactive controls like but-  
tons and links\) on the page. Tabbing is a common navigation approach  
for keyboard users, similar to how mouse users will look for and click  
on links and controls. Keyboard users will press the tab key repeatedly  
until arriving at the desired element and then press Enter to activate  
the control.  
With standard web pages, tab order is based on the sequence of elements  
in the code order. Other formats use other methods—for example, Flash  
calculates tab order based on the location of elements on the screen. In  
either case, it’s important to test tab order to make sure it follows a logi-  
cal progression.  
While it’s possible to manually set tab order in code, the best approach is  
to sequence elements appropriately, so the natural tab order works in a  
logical and usable fashion.  
Don’t require point-and-click interaction  
Supporting keyboard interaction doesn’t mean that you can never use  
complex interactions like drag and drop. Just make sure that all interac-  
tions have an option that does not require pointing.  
Here are some things to keep in mind when designing interactions\:  
• Hover\: Some devices do not support hover, such as touchscreens—  
hover all you want over a touchscreen, and nothing is going to  
happen! Hover actions can also be annoying when they are triggered  
inadvertently, such as when a menu is displayed simply because  
the mouse pointer crossed it on the way to another part of the  
screen. Hovers can also be distracting to people with cognitive or  
attention disabilities.  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 75 From Barrier to Best-in-Class  
When the Apple iPhone first came out, the disability community was  
dismayed\: there were almost no tactile controls, making the phone  
impossible for the blind and people with dexterity disabilities to  
use. But today, Apple’s touchscreen devices—iPad and iPhone—have  
gained a following in the blind community because the interface  
is now designed with voice and gesture input and a built-in screen  
reader, called VoiceOver \(see Figure 5.4\).  
FIGURE 5.4  
VoiceOver speaks  
what is tapped, and  
activates whatever  
item currently has  
focus on a double-tap.  
With the success of VoiceOver, other companies are also building  
accessibility into their devices, although none have reached the level  
of VoiceOver. What’s new, even revolutionary, about these features is  
that they are built into the platform operating systems, so they can be  
turned on and off without any special hardware or software.  
When accessibility features get this easy, they start to become univer-  
sal design. Both VoiceOver and Explore-by-Touch allow eyes-free use  
of the device for anyone whose eyes are otherwise occupied. Siri and  
other voice activation features are innovative uses of voice technology  
that let everyone interact with their devices easily.  
76 Chapter 5 • Select\: Using “select” to trigger actions is problematic for keyboard  
users because events are activated inadvertently as soon as they are  
selected. The best approach is to use a select/activate model of inter-  
action, where elements are selected and identified, and then explicitly  
activated by the user. Using this model, you can build one interaction  
mode that works universally.  
• Drag and drop\: This style of interaction makes direct manipulation  
of objects easy, but typically requires a pointing device and dexterity.  
Instead, you can offer a keyboard-accessible alternative way to move  
items from one place to another \(see Figure 5.5\).  
FIGURE 5.5  
This feature, collect-  
ing bookmarks for  
related items, requires  
a mouse to drag and  
drop items into the list.  
A simple Add button  
would make this more  
accessible.  
Show which element has keyboard focus  
Keyboard users also benefit from a clear indicator showing which element  
currently has focus. Browser software supplies a default focus indica-  
tor—typically a dotted outline around the element. However, keyboard  
usability can be improved by using CSS to provide stronger visual cues  
to help users make deliberate choices about which elements to interact  
with. Figure 5.6 shows an example of CSS code. Best practice is to provide  
the same visual cue as provided to indicate hover—for example, when the  
mouse or other pointing device is “hovering” over an element.  
a\:hover, a\:active, a\:focus \{ outline\: 2px solid blue \}  
FIGURE 5.6  
Use CSS to provide a visible outline around items that have keyboard  
focus. In this example, the same 2 pixel blue outline identifies which  
item is moused over \(hover\), active, or has keyboard focus.  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 77 The User’s Finger Is the Center  
We all love our smartphones, but how can someone  
who can’t see dial the phone on a touchscreen?  
The answer is the Talking Dialer, a free Android app  
from the Eyes-Free project \(including T.V. Raman from  
Google\). It cleverly redefines the interaction from the  
perspective of the user, rather than the device. Here’s  
how it works \(see Figure 5.7\)\:  
• Just touch the screen anywhere\: that’s where the “5”  
button is.  
• Slide your finger up, down, left, right or diagonally  
to reach another number, based on the layout of a  
phone keypad.  
• Talking Dialer announces the number.  
When you have entered the whole phone number, tap  
anywhere at the bottom of the screen to start the call.  
FIGURE 5.7  
Starting from where your finger touches the  
screen, sliding it in any direction selects a number.  
For example, go to the left for a “4” or up diago-  
nally to the right for a “3.”  
Don’t trap keyboard focus  
“Keyboard trap” can happen with embedded objects, such as videos, applets,  
and Flash. When the focus is trapped, users can’t get in or out of an element  
without a pointing device, like a mouse. Techniques for avoiding keyboard  
trap are dependent in large part on the technology of the embedded object.  
Ideally, entering and exiting an embedded object uses the same navigation  
methods as a web page—namely, tabbing and arrow keys. For technologies  
that do not support standard navigation, provide a keyboard option and  
document it so that keyboard users can avoid getting trapped.  
Make controls large enough to operate easily  
Controls on-screen may not be three dimensional, but users still need  
dexterity to operate them. Physical issues from arthritis to tremors can  
make it hard to accurately use a control, but so can context like work-  
ing on a crowded airplane without enough elbow room, or even wearing  
78 Chapter 5 Don’t Make Your Users Build a Frankenkindle  
Glenn’s sister had a problem. She loved to read, but her cerebral palsy made  
handling both books and most ebook readers hard for her. Luckily, Glenn is an  
engineer with the skills to take on projects to make her life easier.  
They found a children’s book reader that she could use, but it didn’t come with  
books she was interested in. The Kindle was a good start because it had buttons  
instead of a touchscreen, but the buttons were too small and stiff for her.  
A little bit of homebrew electronics later, Glenn created the Frankenkindle, substi-  
tuting a set of large buttons for the ones that come with the Kindle \(see Figure 5.8\).  
FIGURE 5.8

gloves. People navigating the web using a touchscreen mobile device can  
run into difficulty trying to, for example, select one of a set of radio but-  
tons, or click a submit button. Even responsive sites may not take into  
account the differences in size between a pointing device and a fingertip.  
The following guidelines help make controls easy to use\:  
• Minimize the fine-motor skills needed for interactive elements.  
Make buttons and touch points large enough.  
• Space controls. Put enough space between controls so that users  
don’t accidentally activate the wrong one.  
• Minimize the complexity of the action required. Choose controls  
that do not require timing or managing multiple actions when pos-  
sible. Watch out for controls like multi-level menus that require a  
steady hand to operate.  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 79 Let users control the operation of the interface  
Try to avoid making changes that are not triggered by an explicit user  
request. For example, the “carousel” of highlighted stories on a home page  
typically advances automatically, based on an estimation of time needed  
to get through the content. Uncontrolled motion in an interface is dis-  
tracting and impacts comprehension. Some users need more time to take  
in the information, so at a minimum, provide a way to stop the action. \(See  
Chapter 9, “Accessible Media” for more information about multimedia.\)  
A better approach is to load the first image and provide clear controls  
for advancing through the stories. This applies to all moving elements,  
including media such as video and audio. Don’t play media automati-  
cally. Instead, wait for users to elect to play the media. Autoplay is not  
only distracting, but can also cause problems for people in a quiet set-  
ting or using a low-bandwidth connection to the web \(such as a weak  
mobile phone signal\).  
Another common practice is opening links in a new window, usually  
with the rationale that it will help users return to the originating website  
because they can just close the window. Unfortunately, opening a new  
window starts a new browsing history. When users navigate in this new  
window and try to use the back button to return to the first website, they  
can’t do so because the first website is not in the history for the program-  
matically opened window. Indeed, this practice could end up having the  
exact opposite of the desired effect—in that, users will not be able to find  
their way back.  
Deciding whether to open a new window is a simple illustration of an  
important principle\: Don’t take actions on behalf of users that they  
can already accomplish on their own.  
People who like to open links in new windows can achieve this expe-  
rience on their own, using built-in browser controls. People who do  
not like opening links in a new window cannot not use that behavior if  
you program it into the interface. As designers, we need to respect the  
boundaries of the user environment.  
Design for contingencies  
Like the fire protection and emergency exit systems of a building, digi-  
tal products must also be built so that when something does go wrong,  
harmful effects are minimized or prevented through error response  
and recovery.  
80 Chapter 5 Defensive Design  
37signals defines defensive design as “design for when things go  
wrong.” In their book, Defensive Design for the Web, they define four  
ways defensive design supports users and helps them recover\:  
• Validates data to check for mistakes before they frustrate the user.  
• Expands available options based on the user’s implied intent.  
• Protects site visitors from server errors and broken links with  
informative messages.  
• Assists the user before mistakes happen.  
Errors can occur on many levels. Some, like broken links or program-  
ming glitches, are a matter of writing valid code \(see Chapter 4, Code to  
standards\). Others occur because of confusion about how things work,  
or through simple mistakes, like clicking on the wrong menu item when  
your elbow is jostled, or poking a small screen. There is no such thing as  
a fail-safe system. No interface is intuitive to every user, and no user is on  
target every time.  
Designing for contingencies is about using design to minimize the  
impact of errors and system failures when they can’t be avoided.  
For example, you should support users who are submitting information,  
ordering a product, or posting a comment.  
• Provide a review page. Allow users to review their input before  
submitting.  
• Give options for editing the submission. Support an iterative  
review/edit process to give users plenty of time and opportunity to be  
certain about their submission.  
• Provide a confirmation page. When the information is submitted,  
confirm the transaction and provide instructions about making any  
additional changes. Confirmation pages not only provide a nice end-  
ing to the interaction, but they also work as conversation\:  
User\: I’d like to place an order. Here’s all my information.  
Your site\: Thanks. Got it. We’ll send this to you within three days.  
Good communication can also make the system easier to operate and to  
avoid errors. For example, if the system requires a specific date format,  
provide an example date right before the input field.  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 81 If an error does occur, provide helpful and accessible feedback in  
response to input errors. The feedback should appear with the element  
containing the error, and should provide clear instructions for how to  
correct the input, as shown in the sample sign-up form in Figure 5.3.  
Allow users to request more time  
Time is a challenge for many people. It may take more time for some-  
one using assistive technologies, such as a screen reader, text enlarger,  
or alternative input device like a joystick. They may read more slowly or  
need more time to think about what they are reading. Other people need  
time to simply move their muscles, and it may take a long time to get  
their arm and hand to coordinate to interact with a link, button, or field.  
Time-outs can ruin their experience.  
Some websites have features that are triggered by time—a common  
example is the timeout feature used for security reasons by many web  
applications. When a user logs into the system, the system notes the time  
and watches the activity. If a predetermined time passes with no activity  
from the user, the system times out and logs the user off.  
A well-designed timeout process alerts users prior to logging them off,  
and provides them with the option to continue the session. Also, if the  
system ends up indeed logging off the user, it caches whatever activity  
they had initiated in the browser. This allows the user to log back in and  
pick up where they left off.  
# Who Is Responsible for Easy Interaction?  
Design and development collaborate on easy interaction. It is possible to  
create interactions that are both innovative and accessible, but it takes  
coordination. Working together to come up with ideas and ways of cod-  
ing the design can take experimentation, prototyping, and cleverness in  
solving problems.  
When the design team understands what’s possible within the con-  
straints of the medium, and the developers understand what’s required  
for universally usable interaction, the results are more likely to be acces-  
sible for everyone.  
82 Chapter 5 WCAG 2.0 and Easy Interaction  
The guidelines for Easy Interaction map to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
A site with easy interaction is Operable, coded to support a variety of  
interactions, such as a mouse, keyboard or assistive technology. It also  
ensures that users can both Perceive and Understand how to interact  
with the site.  
A site with easy interaction meets the guidelines\:  
• 2.1 Keyboard Accessible\: Make all functionality available from a  
keyboard \(Guideline\).  
• 3.2 Predictable\: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable  
ways \(Guideline\).  
• 3.3 Input Assistance\: Help users avoid and correct mistakes  
\(Guideline\).  
The requirements for easy interaction are\:  
• 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence\: Programs can determine the correct  
order of the content \(Level A\).  
• 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 Keyboard\: All functionality can be operated through  
the keyboard without requiring specific timing for each keystroke  
with no exceptions \(Level AAA\) or except where the underlying func-  
tion requires input that depends on the path of the user’s movement  
and not just the endpoints \(Level A\).  
• 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\: The keyboard focus does not get “trapped”  
in a component \(Level A\).  
• 2.4.3 Focus Order\: Elements on the page receive focus in a meaning-  
ful order \(Level A\).  
• 2.4.7 Focus Visible\: Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode  
of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible \(Level AA\).  
• 3.2.1 On Focus\: The context does not change based only on a compo-  
nent receiving focus \(Level A\).  
• 3.2.2 On Input\: The context does not change when a setting is  
changed, unless the user has been advised of the behavior before  
using the component \(Level A\).  
• 3.2.5 Change on Request\: Changes of context are initiated only by  
user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes  
\(Level AAA\).  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 83 • 3.3.1 Error Identification and 3.3.3 Error Suggestions\: An item  
with an error is identified and the error is described to the user in text  
\(Level A\) and with a suggestion \(Level AA\) when possible.  
• 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions\: Labels or instructions are provided  
when content requires user input \(Level A\).  
• 3.3.4 and 3.3.6 Error Prevention\: Actions that submit information  
are reversible and checked for all \(Level AAA\) or for legal and finan-  
cial transactions \(Level AA\).  
• 3.3.5 Help\: Context-sensitive help is available \(Level AAA\).  
• 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value\: Interface elements are identified so that  
their name and role can be read by assistive technology and other  
user agents. There is a way for the program to set any values that  
users can set \(Level A\).  
The full text of the WCAG 2.0 requirements can be found in Appendix B.  
# Summary  
Making the interaction easy for people with disabilities is an exten-  
sion of making interaction easy for everyone. Interactive elements  
are identified clearly and are designed to be easy to use.  
The site supports interaction with a keyboard, allowing assistive  
technology to emulate the keyboard. This also requires that the key-  
board tab order make sense, matching the visual presentation.  
A site with easy interaction enables users to control the interface,  
with large enough controls. It avoids taking unexpected actions for  
users that they can do on their own. Easy interaction also includes  
both preventing and handling errors in an accessible way.  
84 Chapter 5 Profile\: Accessible Interaction with Derek Featherstone  
Derek Featherstone is founder and lead of Simply Accessible, a con-  
sultancy that works to bring accessibility into organizations through  
consulting, training, workshops, and support. Derek is a well-known and  
well-respected advocate for accessible user experience, moving beyond  
technical accessibility to support good and successful experiences for  
everyone. Interactivity is a complex challenge for accessibility, making  
sure that sites and apps are operable in different ways on different devices. We wanted  
to learn from Derek how best to approach a moving target like accessible interaction.  
People are the starting point.  
Concern for people is the primary driver for Derek and his colleagues at Simply  
Accessible. “It has to be about the people who are actually using the site or appli-  
cation to accomplish something. If it’s not about them, then what’s the point?”  
Best accessibility techniques are constantly changing.  
Derek’s team works from a knowledge base of accessible techniques, built over  
years of user research and usability testing. From there, they use observation and  
experimentation to come up with better techniques for coding, designing, and  
writing content that improves the user experience.  
Technical remediation can help make interaction accessible.  
Most often, Derek’s team is called on to make an existing website or app acces-  
sible. Often, the designs are visually rich and appealing, and convey information  
and relationships among elements in a visual way. However, those visual details  
are not always in the code.  
For example, many social media sharing badges don’t have alt text that accurately  
reflects the contents of the badge. Visually, you can tell whether an item has been  
liked or shared, but the code doesn’t contain the same information. Derek and his  
colleagues have been working on a script that would make state and status infor-  
mation available in the code where it’s available to assistive technology.  
We know it would be better if these elements were natively accessible. We also  
know that change doesn’t happen right away. We keep our fixes on file so we  
can use them while the people in charge of social sharing badges work on  
making them more accessible.  
“Our entire team views accessibility as part of overall user experience and not as  
a separate thing that needs to be done afterwards.” However, in practice, clients  
often come to accessibility late in the process, when there is little hope of chang-  
ing the course of the design to produce a more accessible outcome. “What we  
usually do is say, given what you’ve designed, here’s what you need to do to make  
it work in a more accessible way.”  
profile continues on next page  
Easy Interaction\: Everything Works 85 Profile\: Accessible Interaction with Derek Featherstone \(continued\)  
Integrated accessibility produces the best outcomes.  
But in some projects, they are brought in early and remain part of the team  
throughout the project. These projects are the most successful. “What it comes  
down to is having people switched on right from the beginning of the project.  
They understand accessibility as more than a technical checklist.” With an early  
commitment, accessibility becomes part of the well-established user experi-  
ence practice. “One of the most important things to achieve success is to have all  
accessibility touch points built into the process right from the beginning.”  
Tools help teams integrate accessible components.  
Derek and his colleagues have had good success providing teams with tools that  
make it easier to build accessible products. One tool is an accessibility guide,  
integrated into the organizational style guide or branding guide. Another is a  
code repository and pattern library containing elements like modal dialogs or  
tool tips that can be easily dropped into code. “One of our goals is to eliminate  
excuses. We think about all the different pressures people feel when building a  
site and try to address them.”  
The most influential tool for accessibility is clear purpose.  
In cases where Derek has been able to influence design, the best tool in guid-  
ing an accessible process has been clear purpose. “Asking the original question,  
what is the purpose of this page and what are we trying to help people do. And  
once we get answers, we can start asking questions like, how does somebody  
who uses voice recognition software because they don’t have the ability to use  
their hands, how are they going to activate that particular type of control?”  
Solutions come from different places.  
Derek tells a story of a woman who needed a very specific design approach for  
accessible interaction. She was a quadriplegic, but had enough strength in one  
arm to lift her hand and operate a large touchscreen. Her greatest challenges were  
radio buttons and checkboxes, which were too small for her to activate accurately.  
Derek created a stylesheet she could install in her browser that would resize radio  
buttons and checkboxes ten times the size they normally appeared.  
The story illustrates that accessible interaction isn’t about finding the one solu-  
tion that works for everyone. “We can create one solution that works for most  
people’s abilities, but there are some people that need accommodation for their  
disabilities that a designer or developer can’t take into account in their work.” In  
these cases, the work of the designer and developer is to make the design flexible  
and adaptable. That way, browsers and assistive technology can take elements of  
the design and adapt them to meet the specific needs of the user.

# Getting Around an Airport  
Paul Mijkensanaar designed the wayfinding system for 10 inter-  
national airports. This photo is from the bilingual wayfinding system  
at the Geneva International Airport. \(www.mijksenaar.com\)  
In the physical world, we rely on maps, street signs, and how spaces are  
designed to help us get around. A corridor looks different than a meeting  
room, and we know one is for passage and the other is for gathering and  
discussion. Signs identify the routes and destinations, helping us get from  
here to there.  
When signage uses consistent colors, typography, and icons and is placed in  
a visible location, it can be easy for people to find their way, even around a  
crowded airport. In both the online and physical world, people rely on familiar pat-  
terns to help them find their way more easily. A mix of conventions  
and experience helps everyone locate cues in either the physical  
environment or an online interface, using the design of directional signs  
or interaction features like menus, buttons, and links. When these fea-  
tures are easily found where they are most expected, it takes less effort  
to use them. Table 6.1 compares the tools for wayfinding in the online  
and real worlds.  
Wayfinding and orientation are especially important on the web where  
users have a relatively small window into the site \(and an even smaller  
view on the tiny screens of mobile devices\). Every site needs orienta-  
tion features to help users know where they are, and it needs wayfinding  
features to help users find their way to the information or function  
they came to the site for. When these features anticipate users’ needs, it  
makes using a site easier for everyone.

When I can learn the pattern, I can find

I like games. The ones where you have to  
find your way around a maze are good  
because I can go over them, and I can  
learn how they work. It’s OK to get lost  
and have to figure out a game.  
But when I’m trying to find something, like an assignment  
for school, I don’t like getting lost. I want to know where I’m  
going—because it’s easier, and it’s easier to find things again  
when I need them. When it’s clear and I can tell where I am,  
I like the site. It’s like learning how to walk to school on my  
own. I practiced finding my landmarks, so I would know where  
to turn. I know that it’s 500 steps from 1st Avenue to the first  
street I have to cross. Just like I know what to click on to get to  
my history class page on my school’s website.  
# How Helpful Wayfinding  
# Supports Accessibility  
Wayfinding includes both navigation \(features that let users move around  
the site\) and orientation \(identifying the current location\). A site with way-  
finding that works well for both visual navigation and all kinds of assistive  
technology makes the online environment usable for everyone.  
With helpful wayfinding, people can navigate a site, feature, or page  
following self-explanatory signposts.  
• Navigation options make sense. It can take more effort to navigate  
a website or web application using assistive technology, which makes  
every action more important. Links that aren’t clear and menus that  
are confusing can result in ping-ponging among sections and back-  
tracking. Clear wayfinding reduces the chance of making the wrong  
choice among navigation options.  
• The interface supports exploration. No one wants to be pushed  
through a chute with no options. Sometimes the fun is in finding your  
own way through a site. When a site has good wayfinding, explora-  
tion is safe, because it offers clear cues about where each link or menu  
option leads, and it has consistent ways back.  
90 Chapter 6 • People know where they are. We all like to know where we are.  
When people are following a link or diving into the middle of a site,  
they need to know where they have landed, and what’s available on  
this page. A site designed for easy wayfinding provides strong orien-  
tation cues so that everyone can use them, no matter how they are  
accessing the site.  
# How to Design Helpful Wayfinding  
People rarely go online for the sheer joy of navigating around a site or  
app. \(Perhaps people working on user experience do, but it’s not the most  
usual reason.\) The goal in designing navigation is to make it so intui-  
tive that it becomes invisible to the user. With well-designed wayfinding,  
users can find their way around with minimal effort.  
Create consistent cues for  
orientation and navigation  
People tend to navigate partly by using the cues they experience in real time  
and partly by using a cognitive map, or mental construct, of the space \(real  
or digital\) they are navigating. Even small variations can be disorienting.  
Although a clear and consistent model is important for any user, it  
is especially important for people who use screen readers and other  
technologies that read the page linearly. For linear access, consistent  
placement of elements and use of consistent semantic markup, including  
headings, helps users form mental models.  
A visual user, for example, might quickly learn that there is a logo in a  
banner at the top of the page, search in the upper-right corner, and see a  
colorful title marking the beginning of the main content. A nonvisual user  
might equally quickly learn that the same title is the second heading on  
the page and use that model to jump rapidly to content on other pages.  
Present things that are the same in the same way  
One way to help users find their way around a site is to be consistent in  
how elements of the site are presented and labeled, which doesn’t mean  
that the site must be boring with no variation or texture. However, ele-  
ments of the site that form important landmarks should be consistent\:  
• Describe or label the same thing in the same way each time.  
• Be consistent about the location in the page structure of key navigational  
elements, including menus and links to features like contact pages.  
Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users 91 Good Signposting Supports Cautious Clickers  
Research with older adults found some distinctly different patterns in how they  
interacted with websites.  
• They were “cautious clickers” who spent more time reading before deciding  
to click on a link.  
• They were more likely to try to click on text that was not linked, hoping that  
it would let them find the information they wanted.  
• They had more difficulty understanding where they were within a site. For  
example, they would click on the current page link in the left menu.  
When the team redesigned pages to accommodate their needs, older adults had  
less trouble navigating. Their design recommendations were\:  
• Use action words as links.  
• Present links in an obvious and consistent way.  
• Include images used as icons or bullets in the link.  
• Use simple, clear navigational cues and labels.  
• Use secondary or pop-up windows rarely.  
“Web Usability and Age\: How Design Changes Can Improve Performance” by Ann  
Chadwick-Dias, Michelle McNulty, and Tom Tullis. http\://dl.acm.org/citation.  
cfm?id=957212  
The relationship between links and the pages they point to should also  
be consistent. Consider these basic rules\:  
• The text of the link should accurately communicate the page or  
feature that the link connects to.  
• The text of the link and the title of the target page should be similar,  
if not identical.  
Differentiate things that are different  
When navigating in the real world, differences help you stay oriented.  
You recognize the corner where you turn not just by the name of the  
road, but because you recognize the building on the corner, or because  
the traffic on the main road sounds different than the quiet side streets.  
It’s the same on websites. Differences in layout and page elements help  
identify the page type or site section. For example, when encounter-  
ing a carousel of big images and bold headlines, you might assume that  
you are on a home page. A page that is mostly information is probably  
92 Chapter 6 a content page. And a page with a lot of links is for navigation, or what  
Ginny Redish calls a “pathway” page.  
There can be too much consistency if it blurs important distinctions.  
People like predictability, so when the same words, images, or buttons  
do different things, it’s disorienting and breaks their mental models.  
Provide orientation cues  
Orientation—knowing where you are—is an important part of success-  
ful wayfinding. When arriving at a page, how easily can you tell where  
you are and answer questions like “What is on this page?” or “What site  
is this page part of?” and “Where am I in this site?”  
Orientation is important whether the journey starts from the home page  
or the user has landed in the middle of a site by following a link. In fact,  
users are more likely to start from the middle of a site than to navigate  
from the home page. Either way, the site needs clear “You Are Here” ori-  
entation cues, integrated into the design, content, and code.  
• Identify the site. Be sure that it’s easy to find the name of the site and  
to identify the organization behind the site.  
• Title the page. The page title is the text that appears in the title bar  
of the browser. It’s also the text that displays in a bookmarks list, in  
search results, and it is the first thing announced by screen reader  
software. The title tells what the page is about, and it also provides  
orientation cues. A good convention is to include page title, section  
name, and site name \(in that order\) in the \<title\> tag.  
• Provide good headings. Headings describe the main topic of the  
page, as well as sections of content. Marking up headings using the  
correct markup \(\<h1–h6\>\) makes it easier for people who use assistive  
technology to find them.  
• Start with an overview. It’s common for users to leave sites if they  
don’t see what they are looking for quickly. “Bouncing” is part of gen-  
eral behavior on the web, but you can help people make an accurate  
assessment by providing good content overviews.  
• Highlight the current location. There are many ways to identify  
where a page fits into a site, from the page title to highlighting the  
menu item for the section to breadcrumb navigation.  
• Use multiple cues. Providing more than one cue for orientation helps  
both visual and verbal thinkers. For example, using an icon with  
color-coding and a strong text label provides three ways to identify a  
page or feature.  
Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users 93 When describing the interface, avoid using details like color or even loca-  
tion on the screen as the only cues in the instructions. Directions like “in  
the upper-left corner” don’t mean much to someone navigating by audio.  
It’s okay to use color and location along with other nonvisual cues\: “The  
blue link labeled ‘Contact Us’ in the upper-left corner.”  
Provide clear landmarks within the page  
Once visitors have gotten to a page, they still need to find their way  
around. Good visual design cues, good headings and other labels, and  
good underlying structure have to work together to make this pro-  
cess easy for everyone. When they do, the parts of the page are easy  
to differentiate both visually and in the code so they are available to  
assistive technology.  
One way to provide a navigation map of the page is to use links that  
jump to specific areas of the page. These are often called skip links  
because they let a site visitor skip over sections of the page to go directly  
to key locations on the page. This is especially important as a way to skip  
over repeated blocks of content, like the links and logos in the heading of  
the page \(see Figure 6.1\).  
FIGURE 6.1  
The OpenIDEO pages  
are complicated, with  
many different zones  
on the page. When  
the team retrofitted  
the site for acces-  
sible navigation, skip  
links provided a way  
to create an easy way  
to navigate to the key  
interactions on a com-  
plex page.  
94 Chapter 6 Lea  
Links at the top of the page make  
navigation easier for me.  
I like pages with links at the top of the  
page. It’s really helpful on long pages with  
a lot of sections. I can figure out what’s  
on the page without a lot of work. When  
I first saw a link to jump to the content,  
I didn’t know what it was for, but it sure  
made navigating with a keyboard easier.  
A better way to code navigation is with HTML5 elements and ARIA roles.  
These are complementary ways to identify parts of the page \(see Table 6.2  
and Figure 6.2\). Adding elements and roles makes pages semantically rich  
by embedding information about the purpose of different elements. This  
information is then available for software—browsers, search engines,  
assistive technology—to use to enhance the user experience. For example,  
screen readers provide controls to move focus among the sections, which  
lessens the need for skip links as a way to bypass blocks of content. By  
coding boundaries around elements, you create clear landmarks that do  
not rely on visual properties, such as outlines or background color.  
Because HTML is in a transitional phase, one of the challenges of work-  
ing with these new standards is that using both elements and roles can  
create some duplication. For example, using both the \<main\> HTML ele-  
ment and the “main” ARIA role means that some screen readers will  
announce both, and users will hear, “main main.” Over time, many of the  
ARIA roles will be incorporated into HTML5, and assistive technology

FIGURE 6. 2  
HTML5 elements and ARIA roles are complementary. Including both of them in  
your site provides a solid code structure and good navigation around the page.  
will work with the standards in a more consistent way. Until then, using  
ARIA roles and HTML5 elements is the best approach to ensure that this  
important information is available to all users.  
Provide alternative ways to navigate  
It’s important to reiterate\: there is no one way to provide accessibility.  
The solution instead is to provide alternatives. For helpful wayfinding,  
this means offering different navigational options.  
Most sites include more than one way to move around the site\: menus,  
links, a sitemap, or search. Providing alternatives improves the chance  
that people will find what they are looking for.  
For many people, given the choice of browsing through menus to explore  
options versus using search, search wins. For people with disabilities,  
for whom navigation can be slower and more difficult, search provides  
the means to jump directly to the right page. Many sites have realized  
the universal appeal of search and have made it prominent on the home  
page so it’s easy to use to navigate.  
96 Chapter 6 Google Maps  
You might not realize that the turn-by-turn text directions in Google Maps that  
so many people rely on started as an accessibility feature \(see Figure 6.3\).  
FIGURE 6.3  
The original interface to Google Maps was entirely visual. Users would  
explore the map, including all the rich information about local features,  
and follow the guide on the visual map to get from place to place.  
T.V. Raman, a research scientist at Google, created the first Textual Maps UI. As  
he wrote in his blog in 2006, “When using spoken output, this visual richness can  
get in the way of quickly listening to the results of a maps query.”  
His solution was an alternative interface that “serves up directions very efficiently  
when working with a screen reader or a braille display. … It’s extremely useful for  
blind and visually impaired users, as well as an effective solution for those times  
when you’re at a nongraphical display and need to quickly look up a location. Just  
type a simple English query of the form start address to end address and quickly  
get the information you’re looking for. Though we added this option to enhance the  
accessibility of Google Maps for blind and low-vision users, perhaps others will find  
this alternative view a useful addition to their maps arsenal.”

Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users 97 Who Is Responsible for Wayfinding?  
Creating helpful wayfinding relies on both good design practices and  
user research. Understanding how your audience thinks about the infor-  
mation architecture is critical.  
The design and content teams are responsible for strong information  
architecture, backed up by good user research. The teams should look for  
opportunities to help users make their way through the space and pro-  
vide clear, distinctive landmarks to help them stay oriented.  
In addition, it’s important that wayfinding elements in the design and  
content are supported by the code, with landmarks that provide alterna-  
tive ways to navigate a site or application.  
# WCAG 2.0 and Helpful Wayfinding  
The guidelines for Helpful Wayfinding map to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
A site with helpful wayfinding is Operable and Understandable, with  
landmarks for orientation and wayfinding presented both in the content  
and code.  
Wayfinding relies on being\:  
• 2.4 Navigable\: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and  
determine where they are \(Guideline\).  
• 3.2 Predictable\: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable  
ways \(Guideline\).  
The requirements for helpful wayfinding are\:  
• 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks\: Users can bypass blocks of repeated content  
\(Level A\).  
• 2.4.2 Page Titled\: Web pages have titles that describe topic or pur-  
pose \(Level A\).  
• 2.4.4 and 2.4.9 Link Purpose \(In Context or Link Only\)\: The pur-  
pose of each link can be determined from the link text alone \(Level  
AAA\) or from the link text together with context \(Level A\).  
• 2.4.5 Multiple Ways\: More than one way is available to locate a web  
page within a set of web pages, except for pages that are a step in a  
process \(Level AA\).  
98 Chapter 6 • 2.4.6 and 2.4.10 Headings and Labels\: Headings and labels describe  
topic or purpose \(Level AA\) and are used to organize content  
\(Level AAA\).  
• 2.4.8 Location\: Information about the user’s location within a set of  
web pages is available \(Level AAA\).  
• 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation\: Navigational mechanisms that are  
repeated on a set of web pages are presented consistently \(Level AA\).  
• 3.2.4 Consistent Identification\: Components that have the same  
functionality within a set of web pages are identified consistently  
\(Level AA\).  
The full text of the WCAG 2.0 requirements can be found in Appendix B.  
# Summary  
Helpful wayfinding depends on consistent, understandable cues  
that help users know where they are \(orientation\) and how to get  
where they want to go \(navigation\).  
Some aspects of wayfinding are part of the content and presenta-  
tion design\: titles for pages, naming things that are the same in the  
same way each time \(and differentiating things that are different\),  
and including information about where users are in a page, site,  
or process.  
Helpful wayfinding also relies on cues in the code, including ARIA  
landmarks, which act as descriptive landmarks for navigating  
around the page, and descriptive coding for navigation elements.  
Helpful Wayfinding\: Guides Users 99 PATRICK H. LAUKE  
Profile\: Coding Accessibility with Steve Faulkner  
Steve Faulkner has been an accessibility engineer since 2001, first with  
Vision Australia and currently with The Paciello Group. He has a hand  
in developing HTML5 and WAI-ARIA specifications as a member of W3C  
working groups, and is editor of W3C specifications on HTML5, Using  
ARIA in HTML, accessibility APIs, and text alternatives. In short, Steve  
has accessibility chops.  
Because much of what’s needed is beneath the surface of a page, we asked Steve to explain  
what user experience designers should know about how code supports accessibility.  
Elements of an accessible user interface.  
Web accessibility is largely about providing the information needed to make a user  
interface accessible to assistive technology \(AT\). This is accomplished via an acces-  
sibility application programming interface \(API\)—a standardized way of specifying  
elements of an interface. For accessibility, Steve explains, “One piece of the puzzle is  
for information to be defined by an accessibility API. The second piece of the puzzle  
is for AT to make use of it.”  
For the web, every HTML element has a role, states, and properties that are defined  
in the technology specification—“what it is, what it does, and where it’s at, at this  
point in time.” That information is expressed by the accessibility API in the browser  
so that assistive technology can make use of it. “For example, with a heading, one of  
the properties might be its level, and whether it’s editable, visible, or linked.” Infor-  
mation in the accessibility API allows assistive technology to, for example, create a  
list of headings or move keyboard focus to the main heading of a page.  
An accessibility apI needs more than htML.  
There are gaps in how native HTML elements support the accessibility API. “Some  
decisions about what goes into HTML and what doesn’t don’t take into account  
accessibility requirements.” For example, the role “main” is not represented in the  
HTML5 specification as an element, despite the expressed need for AT users to  
move cursor focus to the main content area. Other roles are defined, such as header,  
footer, and navigation\: “I guess the thinking was, anything that’s not something else  
must be the main content.”  
Also, HTML elements are not always used correctly. As an example, Steve explained  
that HTML buttons have been part of the specification for 15 years. However, devel-  
opers build custom buttons using elements like images and links that are coded to  
behave like buttons. Typically, this is because “They have to please whoever makes  
the design decisions. To achieve a certain visual effect across different browsers and  
platforms, they can’t always use standard controls.” In these cases, “WAI-ARIA is the  
only way to supplement the necessary information for assistive technologies.”  
100 Chapter 6 WAI-arIA fills the gaps.  
WAI-ARIA fills out the accessibility API, enhancing the descriptive information con-  
tained in native HTML controls and back-filling information for elements that are  
used for other than their intended purpose.  
For example, ARIA provides explicit roles and properties to assist in wayfinding  
for users of assistive technology. Like “stepping stones,” ARIA landmark roles allow  
assistive technology users to step through the content of the page to find the content  
area of interest.  
htML5, arIA, or both?  
In general, support for ARIA is more robust than accessibility support for new  
HTML5 features, because it’s been around longer and has benefited from successful  
collaborations between accessibility experts and software vendors. “I’m not saying  
that it’s good across the board, mainly due to some AT vendors just putting their  
heads in the sand, which has the effect of doing a disservice to their users.” And you  
can count on support for ARIA in the future. “As far as ARIA is concerned, it will  
remain relevant for many years to come. As new issues and technologies emerge,  
there will be new related updates to the ARIA specs to fill in any gaps.”  
It’s best to think of ARIA as complementary to HTML. “A good rule of thumb is,  
when there’s a native HTML structure, element, or attribute that’s well supported,  
use it. If that’s not enough, use the appropriate ARIA semantics.”  
Advice for project teams.  
Steve encourages developers to add ARIA landmark roles. “The good thing about  
landmarks is that you can add them to your current code, and they don’t have any  
design effects.” For interactive widgets that provide complex interactions, he recom-  
mends looking to existing libraries, such as JQuery or Dojo—code with WAI-ARIA  
already built in.  
But he also sees the need for a change in mindset in how we build websites and  
applications. Project efforts often focus on the business transactions that occur  
on the back end, with little thought given to the user interface. “You tend to find  
back-end coders developing front ends without understanding what makes a user  
interface usable, let alone accessible.”  
On the design end, Steve urges designers to understand that design elements are not just  
“pixels on a page,” but rather semantic containers for information described in code. “I  
don’t think designers need to know how to code. They do need to understand that there’s  
a give and take between what can be done, given the requirement to actually code.”  
Overall, he believes project teams must include user interface expertise. “What’s  
needed is the realization within a team of the value of having people who under-  
stand usable UI design and can bring it to fruition using the code.”

# ClearRX Medication Labeling System  
With ClearRX, the important information—drug name, dosage,  
instructions—takes precedence over secondary details, like manufac-  
turer and pharmacy information. Precautions are detailed clearly and  
prominently on the other side of the bottle, using plain language and  
clarifying icons.  
School of Visual Arts student Deborah Adler used her design training to  
improve packaging for medications in her Safe RX thesis project. She was  
inspired by her grandmother, who accidentally took her husband’s medica-  
tion because she was confused by the packaging.  
Deborah identified the unclear elements in the current packaging and cre-  
ated prototypes with possible improvements. Target took Deborah’s ideas  
and developed them further into the ClearRX system, which includes pill  
and liquid bottles and a measuring syringe. Clear presentation was a key  
area of improvement, modifying the design to enable easy identification  
and comprehension. “  
Clean,” “elegant,” and “simple” are all words that describe the  
impact of a design with a clean visual presentation. By contrast,  
designs that are “cluttered,” “busy,” or “garish” don’t seem as easy  
to understand and use.  
An elegant visual presentation is the outcome of a straightforward, pur-  
poseful approach to visual and information design. Using techniques  
like white space, alignment, and emphasis, clean designs show relation-  
ships among elements and create an information hierarchy that tells the  
viewer what is related and what is important. Clarity in the presentation  
of elements in a design enhances both usability and accessibility.  
When a site is also designed to be flexible, adapting gracefully to differ-  
ent ways of formatting the display, it is more accessible. It allows users  
to change the font size, simplify the layout, or hide distracting elements  
to be able to read the page. In today’s web, designing for flexibility also  
makes it easy for a site to be responsive to different screen sizes, from the  
smallest smartphone to giant desktop monitors.  
# How Clean Presentation  
# Supports Accessibility  
A clean, clear visual design helps everyone make sense of the information  
and functionality of a website or web application. Cluttered or complex  
pages are difficult for everyone to use effectively, but pose extra challenges  
for people with disabilities. For example, people who use assistive technol-  
ogy, such as enlarged browser displays or screen magnification software,  
only have access to a small viewport at any one time. Some cognitive  
disabilities affect concentration and attention, making distractions  
even more disruptive. As we’ll discuss in Chapter 9, “Accessible Media,”  
animated or flashing elements can even cause physical harm.  
With clean presentation, people can perceive and understand ele-  
ments in the design.  
• Pages adapt to different display requirements. An accessible web-  
site or app allows users to modify the display. For example, people  
with low vision use software that can enlarge the text, or they use their  
browser settings to zoom in on the entire page. When the presentation  
is designed for flexibility, the information design is clear in any display.  
• Information structure is communicated in more than one way.  
People usually think of information design in visual terms, such as  
how elements are arranged in an information space\: they use visual  
cues, such as alignment and white space, to guide the eye through  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 105 information and interactive elements. But you cannot rely on just one  
sense—in this example, vision—to communicate meaning. Users may  
not have access to information conveyed visually, or they may have  
changed the display to meet their own needs, thereby changing the  
information design.  
• The visual design makes content easier to read. Medical and reha-  
bilitation research on how people learn to read suggests that some  
problems with literacy have their roots in visual ability and how the  
brain processes text. For example, unsteady eye movements can make  
it hard to keep track of the line of words being read, or poor binocular  
vision can make letters appear to move around. Good contrast and  
line spacing, white space around content, and even the shorter sen-  
tences recommended in plain language guidelines help people read  
more easily \(see Chapter 8, “Plain Language”\).  
Why can’t the text be just a little  
bit larger?  
I’ve always loved reading, but my eyesight  
has been going for years. Now, it’s getting  
worse with this macular degeneration in  
one eye. A friend gave me a magnifier that  
Carol  
she used for needlework. It sits over my  
book, so my hands are free. That helped  
for a long time. But even though I’m not very good at using  
the computer, I still like to try, especially to see the photos my  
grandkids send me. I love keeping up with them that way.  
Some sites have text that’s just so small. I don’t know what I can  
do. I’ve learned how to set up my browser so that the text is  
bigger. It makes the links bigger, too, so I can click on them more  
easily. I wish all the sites would do this. Some just don’t seem to  
work. The text stays the same size, and I can’t read it at all.  
# How to Design for Clean Presentation  
A clean design with the goal of accessibility starts by applying best prac-  
tices for information and graphic design, which benefit all users. Since  
software is an important “user,” you need to apply those best practices  
both on the surface and in the code, so information structure can be  
conveyed to nonvisual users. And you need to design for flexibility, so the  
information design remains easy to understand and use, even in differ-  
ent display formats.  
106 Chapter 7 Design simply  
To design simply is to design with restraint. Unfortunately, there are  
many competing factors that must be considered in a design, and busi-  
ness concerns can too easily win over user needs. Clients may request  
“flashy” designs that “pop” as they look for ways to stand out from com-  
petitors. But simplicity can be a great differentiator, where important  
elements stand out and the site stays true to purpose \(see Chapter 3,  
“Clear Purpose,” Design for clarity and simplicity\).  
In addition, simple designs are easier to make responsive to different  
devices and display formats.  
In general\:  
• Simple designs are stable and coherent. Each element in the design  
is necessary to the overall information and functionality. Simplicity  
provides a sense of unity to the elements of the design.  
• Consistent designs are easier to use because, once learned, the  
interaction model can be applied throughout the product. For  
example, websites that have the same functional element, like the  
search field, in different locations through the site require that the  
user relearn the interface on each page.  
• Design conventions can help with usability because we all know  
how they work. For example, when a group of controls on the screen  
are surrounded by a visual box, we know they are related to one  
another—and this relationship can be encoded in the document.  
• Design patterns are also helpful. No need to reinvent the wheel  
for the sake of creativity—at least, not in the site or app framework.  
Using conventions and patterns makes the design more consistent.  
Minimize distracting clutter  
Distractions and clutter make it difficult to concentrate on the task at  
hand. With a cluttered design, the user begins working with a page by  
first developing a strategy for identifying relevant items and tuning out  
distractions. For people with disabilities that affect concentration and  
comprehension, this need may be keener, and developing a strategy may  
require more effort.  
Unfortunately, business requirements and client expectations often  
lead to cluttered designs. When adding a new feature to a design that is  
already cluttered, one way to draw attention is to add motion of some  
sort. And with the next new feature, more motion, and so on.  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 107 Making a Good First Impression  
You only have one chance to make a good first impression. On a website or web  
application, first impressions are a deciding factor in whether people stay or go.  
The longer people stay, the more likely they are having an enjoyable experience.  
Several eye-tracking research studies have shown that users scan the page and  
make their decision about where to focus in about 2.6 seconds. In one study, users  
were shown screenshots of websites for law schools. They spent an average of 20  
seconds on each one. The areas of the page that drew their interest included\:  
• The institution’s logo \(6.48 seconds\)  
• The main navigation menu \(6.44 seconds\)  
• The search box \(6 seconds\)  
• Social networking links to sites such as Facebook and Twitter \(5.95 seconds\)  
• The site’s main image \(5.94 seconds\)  
• The site’s written content \(5.59 seconds\)  
• The bottom of a website \(5.25 seconds\)  
Participants were then asked to rate sites based on their design. The researchers  
found that the longer they stayed on the page “the more favorable their impres-  
sions were. First impressions are important for keeping people on pages.”  
“Eye-tracking Studies\: First Impressions Form Quickly on the Web,” Missouri  
University of Science and Technology. http\://news.mst.edu/2012/02/  
eye-tracking\_studies\_show\_firs/  
Ultimately, meeting business needs means satisfying user needs by provid-  
ing the most direct path to relevant content and functionality. You don’t  
want a user’s first impression of your site to be, “Whoa! How do I cope with  
this design?” So try to minimize clutter, avoid elements that move or auto-  
play, and provide clear access to the features that users want.  
See Chapter 5, “Easy Interaction,” Let users control the operation of the  
interface and Chapter 9, Use dynamic elements carefully for more on  
minimizing clutter.  
Design for customization of the display  
One person’s “clean” is another’s “clutter”—it’s impossible to create a  
design that will work perfectly for all users. Fortunately, the web is a  
flexible medium, unlike paper or physical products. It’s also a user-  
controlled medium that responds first and foremost to user settings.  
While web designers provide a starting point, or default design, along  
108 Chapter 7 Readability\: A T ool for Minimizing Clutter  
The wild clutter of features and ads, especially on content pages, has produced a  
market for web page de-cluttering tools. Readability is a service that, according  
to Fast Company’s John Pavlus, “transforms any article, blog post, or long feature  
from a Flash-addled, ad-encrusted headache into a calm, humane … readable  
experience.”1 Readability works on the understanding that reading requires a  
level of focus that cannot be achieved with extraneous elements competing for  
attention. To remove distractions, Readability software pulls out the main con-  
tent of a page and displays it in a clean, customizable format \(see Figure 7.1\).

Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 109 Designing Responsive Layouts Using a Flexible Grid  
For users, flexible layouts work best because they can adjust designs to fit  
certain criteria; for example, by enlarging the default text size in browser  
preferences. Fixed designs make it harder for users to adapt their view.  
For designers who want to be able to control the visual presentation pre-  
cisely, flexible designs are harder to embrace. One approach to designing  
for different devices has been to create fixed designs that display well in  
different contexts. However, it’s costly to have several versions to maintain.  
Enter Responsive Web Design! RWD allows for one codebase containing  
the content of the page, with instructions for multiple layouts for differ-  
ent size screens. This approach has gained traction with designers and  
developers, and supports flexibility for accessibility, too. Flexible at its  
core, it allows for some control over how pages look and behave in differ-  
ent contexts. \(See the profile in this chapter, Responsive Design with Ethan  
Marcotte, for details from the RWD inventor himself.\)  
RWD appeals to designers because it allows them to be both flexible and  
design to a grid. Layout grids bring balance and consistency to a design.  
Grid dimensions are usually based on fixed values derived from the  
dimensions of the output. Whether business card, poster, or billboard,  
a symmetrical layout grid based on the width/height ratio of the final  
printed size is a dependable way to position elements in a design.  
But what about layout grids in a flexible environment like the web, where  
output dimensions are unknown? How can users enjoy the benefits of bal-  
ance and consistency and still customize the display?  
In his 2009 A List Apart article, Ethan Marcotte found a way to create a  
grid based on relative measures \(ems\) that would adjust while keeping the  
relative proportions of the design. Using the formula target ÷ context =  
result, he showed how to arrive at the correct em value to use to size dif-  
ferent elements of the design.  
Say you are aiming for a heading sized at 24 pixels \(target\). You know the  
standard default text size in most browsers is 16 pixels \(context\). Plug  
those numbers into the formula, and you get 24 ÷ 16 = 1.5, or the CSS dec-  
laration font-size\: 1.5em. You can use the same formula to get relative  
values to define the size of page elements.  
Flexible grids create balanced and coherent layouts that adapt when  
users customize their display or use different devices. Figure 7.2 shows an  
example of a page in four different views.

Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 111 with page content, users determine how the content displays. But that  
works only when designs are coded with flexibility in mind.  
Flexible designs start by separating content from presentation \(see  
Chapter 4, “Solid Structure,” Use semantic markup for content\). This  
separation allows the content to adapt to different displays because the  
design instructions are in a stylesheet rather than embedded in the con-  
tent. This separation allows browsers to use different instructions for  
different contexts and user needs.  
Design for flexibility requires more than just stylesheets. There are many  
aspects of a design that are affected by different contexts. For example,  
when a user changes the width of the browser window, the page is redis-  
played to fit. Using relative measures, like ems or percentages, results  
in a page that adapts better when users enlarge type size or view a page  
on large and small screens. No one wins when text overlaps or the whole  
side of the page is cut off and the page is unreadable.  
A customizable design is the most effective approach for people with  
vision disabilities, as their needs are diverse and cannot be addressed  
with any one design. Instead, try to create a design with flexibility in  
mind that retains its integrity, functionality, and content while allowing  
users to make necessary changes to its visual display.  
Support customization through the browser  
Some websites include customization features to allow users to adjust  
the display directly on the website—for example, by enlarging the text,  
changing color settings, and adjusting page width and number of col-  
umns. To some extent, these are helpful, although it’s a bit like providing  
reading glasses along with a book. People visit many websites and will  
likely arrive at yours with their glasses in place—that is, running nec-  
essary software and with their browser and operating system settings  
configured to meet their needs and preferences.  
Recently, leading sites like the BBC \(www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility\) have  
taken a different approach. First, they build their sites to standards, so  
they work with all the built-in features of the browsers. Then, instead of  
building custom controls for flexibility, their accessibility Help pages  
teach users how to use those features to adjust the display for all sites.  
Most importantly, be sure that any changes to the presentation, such as  
text size or zoom, fonts and text colors, or set language options, work  
across all the pages on your site. Imagine having to reset the text size  
on every page.  
112 Chapter 7 Customizable Designs for Low-Vision Users  
In 2003, Mary Frances Theofanos and Ginny Redish conducted a  
research study with a group of users whose vision was impaired  
enough to require screen magnification software. Vision disabili-  
ties varied among the participants, from congenital to those types  
that come with aging. An important outcome from the study was the  
following insight\: “The needs of low-vision users are too diverse for  
simple solutions to web accessibility and usability.”  
They found that flexibility is key, creating designs that respond to cus-  
tomizations and configurations that are tuned to individual needs.  
And while they stressed that simple solutions were not possible, their  
design guidelines for low-vision users provided a good starting point\:  
• Never rely on color alone to convey functional meaning—that  
includes not relying on background color alone to define different  
sections of a web page.  
• Outline tabs with a black border so that they look like tabs even  
when their special colors are taken away.  
• Do not use graphic images for textual elements like links.  
• Use relative sizes for text, not absolute sizes.  
• Check stylesheets and fonts on actual pages to be sure that all the  
text enlarges properly.  
• Use sans serif type for websites.

Their Needs\: Is One Site for All Feasible?” by Mary Theofanos and

People with some vision disabilities need specific color combinations or  
amounts of contrast between the text and background. For these users,  
the simple contrast requirements in the WCAG 2.0 are not enough to  
make the page accessible. Instead, they use high-contrast modes, such as  
an inverted color scheme; for example, perhaps a black background with  
yellow text. Many browser settings for high contrast also remove back-  
ground colors and images, so that there is a uniform color behind the  
text. This means that any content or interface elements provided by the  
background disappears.  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 113 If I can adjust my screen, I can read  
comfortably.  
I use a smaller window than I used to,  
because my vision kind of fades out at the  
edges. When I can, I make the whole page  
larger, so I can see the details in images  
Vishnu  
better, too. Once I find a site that I can set  
up to read well, I stick with it—the BBC for  
international news, a cricket site. What I really want is for the  
web to look the way I need it to, not just a few favorite sites.  
Design content for easy comprehension  
It’s difficult to separate “content” into “words” and “presentation”  
because they are both critical for making content easy to scan and  
understand. In Chapter 8, you’ll learn how words, sentences, and para-  
graphs can be written for accessibility. But you also need to think about  
how the information is presented.  
A large, undifferentiated block of text is like a wall of words—uninviting,  
difficult to read and understand, and potentially a barrier. Information  
that is broken up into logical sections is more inviting and accessible,  
and much easier to scan.  
Start by breaking the content into meaningful chunks\:  
• Break up blocks of text into short paragraphs with headings, follow-  
ing good practice for plain language.  
• Use bullets and tables appropriately to make lists easy to identify  
and scan.  
• Group similar items with design elements that separate them from  
other items on the page.  
Then use semantic markup to encode the information hierarchy of the page\:  
• Use heading tags \(\<h1\> to \<h6\>\) in the correct order.  
• Use list and table markup, for lists and tables only.  
• Use semantic tags \(such as \<fieldset\> and \<nav\> and ARIA roles like  
“navigation” and “banner”\) to group information by function.  
See Chapter 4, Use semantic markup for content and Chapter 6, “Helpful  
Wayfinding,” Provide clear landmarks within the page for more infor-  
mation on how to code for semantic meaning that allows assistive  
technology to work effectively.  
114 Chapter 7 Plain Language Checklist for Clean Presentation  
The Center for Plain Language considers the layout to be as impor-  
tant as the words in helping readers understand a document or web  
page. Their checklist for evaluating plain language includes this set of  
guidelines for the visual design\:  
The design reinforces meaning and makes it easier for the audience to  
see, process, and use the information. Consider if the design\:  
• Organizes the information in a sequence that’s logical for the  
audience.  
• Uses layout to make information easy to find, understand, and use.  
• Uses principles of good design—including appropriate typography,  
font size, line spacing, color, white space, and so on.  
• Uses visuals to make concepts, information, and links easier to see  
and understand.  
• For online information, minimizes the number of levels.  
• For online information, layers information appropriately, avoiding  
too much on one page.  
http\://centerforplainlanguage.org/about-plain-language/checklist/  
Use color contrast to separate  
foreground from background  
Without contrast, the whole world would just be gray. The design needs  
to meet color contrast requirements for people with vision or color per-  
ception deficiencies. Color combinations that are easily distinguishable  
to someone with normal vision may not work at all for people with one  
of the many types of visual disabilities. Contrast perception can also  
be reduced due to environmental factors, such as display settings and  
light conditions.  
To distinguish the foreground elements, there must be sufficient color  
contrast between the foreground and background. Too little contrast  
between the text and background reduces legibility and causes fatigue  
for readers.  
To provide enough contrast, you have to maximize color differences.  
Black and white have the greatest contrast, since white has 100% light-  
ness and black has 0% lightness. Here are a few guidelines for creating  
good contrast\:  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 115 • Choose complementary colors, or colors from opposing sides of the  
color circle  
• Choose colors with different degrees of lightness, such as a light  
color from the top half of the circle with a dark color from the bottom  
half of the circle  
• Make the font large enough. Use more contrast for text in a smaller  
font. If you are using a light color on a dark background, the text must  
be larger or bolder, especially for reading on a computer screen.  
• Avoid using only a pastel background to separate blocks of infor-  
mation. Pale backgrounds may not be visible to people with color  
perception disabilities. Combine background colors with borders,  
rules, extra white space, or other visual elements.  
A quick way to check color contrast is by looking at the presentation in  
grayscale \(see Figure 7.3\). The WCAG 2.0 guidelines include acceptable  
values for color contrast for both large and small text, since small text  
requires more contrast for legibility. Fortunately, testing for sufficient  
color contrast is easy. There are tools, like the Color Contrast Analyzer,  
which allow you to verify color combinations. When the default colors in  
the design have enough contrast, fewer people need to rely on customiz-  
ing their browser settings, making the design more universal.  
FIGURE 7.3  
Good contrast is not just for accessibility. It’s a great way to make sure that  
your page or infographics will print well on a grayscale printer. Notice that even  
though this image has both red and green, the highly saturated red is still vis-  
ible against the lighter green in the grayscale image. \(Image from NISTIR-7537\:

116 Chapter 7 Do Zebra Stripes Make T ables More Readable?  
The formatting of tables can make a big difference in how readable the informa-  
tion is. In a study comparing different ways of presenting tabular data, Tom Tullis  
and Stan Fleischman found that a larger font, loose spacing, and alternate color  
rows helped participants find specific information more accurately and effi-  
ciently than using lines around the cells \(see Figure 7.4\).  
A few years later, Jessica Enders took a look at the common practice of “zebra strip-  
ing” or displaying alternate rows in a table with different background colors. When  
she ran an experiment, she did not find strongly improved accuracy or speed. How-  
ever, participants preferred tables with alternating background colors.  
FIGURE 7.4  
This table uses both  
zebra striping and the  
loose spacing that  
Tullis and Fleischman  
recommend.

Contrast can be tricky to check when the background is a texture or  
image because each letter may be used against several different back-  
ground colors. It is also more difficult for people to read text against a  
varied background. Use a solid background behind text.  
Use visual and semantic space  
The neutral space between elements brings clarity to a design, making  
it easy to see the sequence and relatedness of design elements. Neutral,  
blank space is created visually with the style settings for margins, line  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 117 height, indents, and blank lines. Using markup creates “space” semanti-  
cally by identifying each element separately.  
For example, in a navigation menu, you use white space to visually sepa-  
rate each menu item and to separate the menu from other page elements.  
In the code, you perform the same delimiting function, enclosing each  
menu item in an \<li\> tag and separating the menu from other content  
with \<ul\> and \<nav\> tags.  
White space helps everyone make sense of a design. Using semantic  
markup makes the function of white space programmatically deter-  
minable. \(For more on sectioning markup see the table in Chapter 4,  
Sectioning markup to group and label\).  
Provide enough space between lines of text  
Line spacing, or leading, is another facet of white space that impacts  
accessibility \(see Figure 7.5\). Sometimes called line-height, leading is the  
distance from the baseline of one line of text to the next. The amount of  
Narrow  
line-height\: 120%  
Medium  
line-height\: 150%  
Wide  
line-height\: 180%  
FIGURE 7.5  
Line spacing is like  
the three bears\: it’s  
important that it’s  
not too narrow or  
too wide—both make  
text harder to read.  
118 Chapter 7 white space between lines of text influences how effectively you track  
from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. Too little space can  
cause the text to overlap. Too much space can make it hard to move your  
eye to the next line. It’s best to express line height as a percentage of font  
size, so that leading will adjust based on the user’s preferred text size.  
Use clean typography  
A clean typographic style gives stability and clarity to a design, and it  
also enhances readability. Readability is an important consideration,  
particularly for users who have difficulty reading or who use software  
that makes reading more difficult.  
• Use a clear, easy-to-read typeface. Sans-serif fonts with distinct let-  
ter shapes help people with dyslexia and other vision disabilities read  
more easily. Fonts like Arial, Century Gothic, Verdana, and Trebuchet  
\(and fonts with a similar typeface design\) work well. Fonts that have a  
large x-height \(the height of a lowercase “x”\) fare best on screen.  
• Text alignment creates stability in a design and defines relation-  
ships among elements. Left-aligned text is more readable because  
the consistent left margin creates a stable anchor for tracking  
through lines of text.  
• Stick with one or two fonts in the design. Avoid adjustments to  
type, such as condensed or tightened letter spacing, as they can make  
the text run together.  
• Typographic emphasis draws attention to elements—bold,  
uppercase, italics, underlining, and color. For clear presentation,  
emphasis must be conveyed in the code of the page so it is available  
to software. Also, emphasis should be used sparingly. Too many ele-  
ments competing for attention make it hard to focus. Use underlining  
only for links.  
Note that uppercase letters are effective at getting attention—often  
too effective, as they seem to be shouting. Also, uppercase words are  
not particularly legible because we are used to reading text in a mix of  
uppercase and lowercase letters. We read the shapes of words, as well as  
the letters, and uppercase words are shapeless. It’s best to avoid setting  
text in all uppercase. Figure 7.6 shows a dramatic metaphor for the value  
of mixed case type we saw in a presentation by Drew Davies from Design  
for Democracy.  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 119 FIGURE 7.6  
When everything is the  
same height, it’s hard  
to tell what’s going  
on in the landscape,  
but with a variation  
in shape, color, and  
height, features are  
easy to distinguish.  
# Who Is Responsible for  
# Clean Presentation?  
Information and graphic designers take the lead in the quest for clean  
presentation. Collaboration with others, however, is essential. The con-  
tent team should also be involved in creating the stylesheet, to ensure  
that the styles support clear communication and provide enough varia-  
tion to meet the content needs on the site.  
The development team should code presentation elements in an acces-  
sible manner, so the site presents well across browsers, devices, and  
assistive technology.  
# WCAG 2.0 and Clean Presentation  
The guidelines for Clean Presentation map to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
A site with clean presentation is Perceivable, allowing users to custom-  
ize the presentation to their own needs.  
A site with clean presentation meets the guidelines\:  
• 1.3 Adaptable\: Create content that can be presented in differ-  
ent ways \(for example simpler layout\) without losing information  
or structure \(Guideline\).  
• 1.4 Distinguishable\: Make it easier for users to see and hear content  
including separating foreground from background \(Guideline\).  
120 Chapter 7 Fonts for People with Dyslexia  
Fonts matter for reading disabilities like dyslexia. Several designers around the  
world have created fonts aimed at improving reading and writing for people  
with dyslexia. In fonts like Read Regular, shown in Figure 7.7, the letters are all  
designed with shapes that make them easier to distinguish. They use\:  
• Clear, simple character shapes without unnecessary details or  
embellishments.  
• Distinctive shapes, especially for characters that are similar, such as “b” and  
“d” and “p” and “q.”  
• Long ascenders and descenders to emphasize the difference in the letters.  
• Good spacing between the letters, so that shapes like “r,” “n,” and “m” don’t  
run together.  
• Wider openings in letters to make them easier to recognize.

• 1.4.8 Visual Presentation\: For the visual presentation of blocks of  
text, users can adjust the contrast, text size \(Level AAA\).  
• Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 per-  
cent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally  
to read a line of text on a full-screen window.  
• Line spacing \(leading\) is at least space-and-a-half within para-  
graphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than  
the line spacing.  
• Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs \(40 if CJK\).  
• Text is not justified \(aligned to both the left and the right margins\).  
• 2.4.6 Headings and Labels\: Headings and labels describe topic or  
purpose \(Level AA\).

# Summary  
A clean presentation enhances the usability of the site for everyone  
by designing the visual layout and typography for easy perception.  
However, to ensure that the presentation is accessible for the wide  
variety of visual disabilities, the site must also be designed to allow  
users to customize the look, either through the browser or through  
controls built into the site.  
A site with well-designed stylesheets not only supports user require-  
ments, but also allows the presentation to adjust in response to the  
device and screen size. This sort of flexibility is important to both  
accessibility and responsive design.  
Elements of the presentation that are especially important for  
accessibility are the contrast between the text and background, the  
fonts used, the text size, line spacing, and the use of white space to  
make areas of the screen easy to differentiate.  
122 Chapter 7 Profile\: Responsive Design with Ethan Marcotte  
Ethan Marcotte is a designer who codes and a coder who designs.  
While many web professionals have this combined skill set, Ethan  
brings a high level of mastery to both disciplines. And like all great  
masters, Ethan is also a teacher. Ethan literally wrote the book on a  
flexible design approach called “responsive design.” We wanted to  
learn from Ethan how a flexible approach supports accessibility.  
Ethan started his career in the late 1990s, and has worked in design studios for  
most of his career, including several years as Interactive Design Director for the  
award-winning design studio, Happy Cog. Currently, he runs his own web practice,  
and has worked for a variety of clients including Stanford University, Sundance  
Film Festival, and New York Magazine. He worked on a large-scale and ground-  
breaking design of the Boston Globe, with Filament Group, in which he employed  
the “flexibility in use” principle in a design approach he invented.  
Balancing control and flexibility through responsive design.  
“Flexibility is near and dear to my heart.” Ethan’s early career was spent creat-  
ing flat graphics in Photoshop or Illustrator, and then implementing the design  
in code. “I started off building sites that were 620 pixels wide, then 760, then 960.  
Every couple of years, there was a universal consensus established\: ‘Okay, now it’s  
safe to upgrade.’ But natively the web doesn’t understand width or height or any-  
thing like that.” This disconnect got him thinking about a more flexible approach.  
The essay by John Allsopp, “A Dao of Web Design,” helped Ethan see that by  
bringing preconceptions to the web based on a completely different medium—  
print—designers were getting in the way of the flexibility inherent in the web. And  
that flexibility was key to accessibility. Ethan began to explore ways to achieve  
“controlled flexibility” in web design, a place somewhere between absolute flexibil-  
ity and absolute control.  
What is so fundamentally powerful about the web is that promise of access.  
We have the technology and approach in place to design sites that are as  
viewable on a feature phone as they are on a 27-inch monitor with the latest  
Chrome browser. Flexibility doesn’t require a sacrifice in the quality of the  
experience on one end or the other. It’s all about delivering content to people.  
Ethan says that content delivery is the primary goal of a responsive design  
approach\: making sure that content is universally accessible, regardless of how  
it is accessed. It starts with structured HTML for content, and then uses CSS and  
JavaScript to progressively enhance the experience. HTML5 media queries pro-  
vide the opportunity to “tune the display,” adapting elements such as color and  
size, depending on the needs of the user.  
profile continues on next page  
Clean Presentation\: Supports Meaning 123 Profile\: Responsive Design with Ethan Marcotte \(continued\)  
“Responsive design is really just a new name for a lot of old thinking about capi-  
talizing on the flexibility inherent in the web.” It’s an approach that looks at  
flexibility “not as something we need to work around or constrain, but rather as  
an opportunity to enhance the design.”  
In essence, responsive design is about “bringing the design to meet the users.”  
Redesigning the Boston Globe website.  
Ethan and his colleagues at Filament Group implemented responsive design  
on the Boston Globe website. “It was a seriously fun project. There were a lot of  
interesting problems to solve. And the Globe was really committed to the idea of  
making their content as universally accessible as possible.”  
We didn’t want to think about accessibility at the end of the project, as is  
usually the case. We tried to think broadly throughout the process, and work  
proactively rather than reactively.  
Rather than working from a list of browsers and devices, they focused on char-  
acteristics, such as the size of the screen, the input model, and the availability of  
technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. For example, rather than testing how a  
carousel would work on a specific device, they asked how it would be accessible  
to someone who didn’t have JavaScript. For each type of display or interaction,  
they established a baseline for accessible content, and used progressive enhance-  
ment techniques to enhance the experience for more capable systems.  
The new bostonglobe.com, launched in September of 2011, has been cited as a  
“major step in the evolution of website design,” \(Beaconfire\) providing an “ele-  
gant, readable website no matter what screen size you’re using.” \(Webmonkey\)  
It even displays cleanly on an Apple Newton. “It’s structured HTML—there are  
headings, paragraphs, lists. You can still browse the site. That’s a testament to  
the portability of the technologies we work with.”  
Ahead\: More opportunities for responsiveness.  
Looking ahead, Ethan sees more opportunities to build responsiveness into web-  
sites and web applications, including new CSS3 modules like flex box and grid  
layout, which will allow greater control over the display order of elements. But in  
order to move forward with a responsive approach, he believes that we need to  
revise our expectations about control. For so long, design efforts have been about  
“slotting paragraphs into specific positions on pages.” For universally acces-  
sible content, Ethan urges that designers work with the native flexibility of the  
web, rather than trying to constrain it. “If your web app is a call to one JavaScript  
function that spits out HTML to the page, think about what that experience is  
going to be like for less capable browsers and readers. If you think flexibly from  
the outset, it makes a lot of things much easier.”

# Medicare Summary Notice

changes.pdf  
\_  
The redesigned Medicare Summary Notice letter is not only rewritten  
in plain language, but also formatted with headings and good use of  
clean design principles. You can see the whole letter, showing before  
and after, online. \(www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn\_changes.pdf\)  
We’ve all seen information that is incomprehensible. Sometimes it’s what  
plain language advocates call gobbledegook—information written in com-  
plex sentences, full of jargon, and usually presented in a wall of words.  
The Medicare Summary Notice from the U.S. government is a good exam-  
ple of an unusable government form letter that has been improved through  
plain language. This letter is sent to anyone in the U.S. who receives medical  
benefits covered by Medicare— mostly older adults and people with dis-  
abilities. A press release describing the new design focused on the impact for  
citizens\: “The new Medicare Summary Notice empowers Medicare’s seniors  
and people with disabilities. The statement is easier to understand and navi-  
gate, and makes clear what information to check.” \(www.cms.gov/apps/  
files/msn\_changes.pdf\) Information is critical for all of us, whether reading content or using  
an application. If you can’t read and understand the information,  
then it might as well not be there. And, if it’s confusing, the content  
can be a barrier, leading to mistakes.  
In thinking about language in a universal design context, it’s important  
to remember that plain language is not just a list of rules for grammar.  
Plain language also includes information design—how the informa-  
tion is presented as well as how it is written. Be sure to consider the  
strategies for presenting text in Chapter 7, “Clean Presentation,” when  
designing or creating web content.  
# How Plain Language  
# Supports Accessibility  
Plain language is important to accessibility because cognitive disabili-  
ties and low reading literacy are relatively common, and because people  
read with different levels of literacy. Literacy includes a wide range of  
abilities, from understanding the words themselves to being able to  
assemble those words into meaningful information.  
An International Definition of Plain Language  
The definition from the U.S. Center for Plain Language \(and adopted  
by other organizations around the world\) focuses on the audience\:  
When you write in plain language, you create information that works  
well for the people who use it, whether online or in print.  
Our measure of plain language is behavioral\: Can the people who are  
the audience for the material quickly and easily\:  
• Find what they need?  
• Understand what they find?  
• Act appropriately on that understanding?  
This means that the definition of “plain” depends on the audience.  
What is plain language for one audience may not be plain language for  
another audience.  
Center for Plain Language\: centerforplainlanguage.org/  
about-plain-language/  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 127 With plain language, people can read, understand, and use the  
information.  
• Information is easy to understand, even in poor conditions. As  
much as we would like to think that everyone reads every word we  
write … they don’t. People are in a hurry, get distracted, or miss a  
critical word in a paragraph. They may be scanning a page quickly,  
multi-tasking, or be interrupted.  
People also read in places that make reading more difficult. We are  
often in motion when we read direction and wayfinding signs, even if  
only at walking speeds. We read websites in places with poor lighting,  
in bright sunlight, and on mobile devices with tiny screens \(and tiny  
text\). All of these situations create contextual, temporary impairment  
of our ability to read easily. Writing in plain language means that con-  
tent is structured to support everyone, even careless, rushed readers.  
• The site supports a wider audience. It’s easy to focus on differences  
between audiences, but when it comes to the need for plain language,  
people—even from very different audiences—may be more alike than  
we think. For example, in a project for the Open University, Whit-  
ney and Caroline Jarrett were asked whether the university needed  
separate sites for different kinds of students. At first glance, teens  
leaving secondary school, older adults looking for new educational  
challenges, and people \(often with weaker English language skills\)  
looking for a way up the economic ladder didn’t seem very similar. A  
review of the research confirmed this, suggesting a very different pic-  
ture of each group.  
When they dug into suggested guidelines for how to write and design  
for each audience, they found that the different audiences had similar  
guidelines, even though they started from different characteristics  
\(see Table 8.1\).  
While the guidelines are not exactly the same, the same issues come  
up for each audience, and suggest similar ways of making informa-  
tion clear and usable for different people. For example, all of them  
suggested sticking to words the audience knows, writing with short,  
clear sentences, and using illustrations meaningfully. \(The references  
to these guidelines are in Appendix C, “More Reading.”\)  
• The site supports a global audience and people reading in trans-  
lation. The web is global. Many people read websites in a second \(or  
third\) language. Guidelines for plain language support non-native  
readers, and also make information easier to translate.  
128 Chapter 8 TaBLe 8.1 DIFFERENT AUDIENCES\: SIMILAR GUIDELINES  
AudienceAptitude and Ability Guidelines  
Teens Impatient browsers with short  
attention spans, too distracted  
to read small print carefully.  
Write simply, using words that  
are common to your readers’  
vocabulary.  
Be concise and get to the point.  
Use images that add meaning  
and illustrate concepts visually.  
Older Adults Often slower, more careful, and  
hesitant browsers, “cautious  
clickers” who read every word  
on the screen.  
Use words that most older  
adults know.  
Write with short, simple, and  
straightforward sentences.  
Use captions or meaningful  
alternative text for images.  
Low Literacy Slower readers who focus  
on the central content of  
the page, skipping chunks  
of content when they don’t  
understand them.  
Use appropriate vocabulary.  
Write text with a simple  
sentence structure.  
Keep pages, paragraphs,  
sentences short.  
Use information graphics and  
animations to show processes  
and relationships.  
Translating in my head is easier with  
simpler sentences.  
In my field—we’re working on medical  
imaging for diagnostic testing—the pro-  
fessional papers are in English. No matter  
what language we speak in our daily lives,  
Vishnu  
everyone in my company reads two other  
languages\: software mathematics and  
English. It’s the international language. The concepts are com-  
plicated, so I really appreciate it when I find a paper where they  
are presented in clear language. It’s not just reading the paper  
itself—searching and navigating in English can be harder than  
reading the technical papers, where at least I know the jargon.  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 129 How to Design for Plain Language  
Designing content is not so different than designing any other aspect of  
a website. Even if project teams don’t usually talk about “designing con-  
tent,” perhaps they should.  
Principles from previous chapters apply to plain language\:  
• Clear purpose\: Know what you are trying to say.  
• Solid structure\: Use semantic markup for content elements.  
• Clean presentation\: Make content readable in both words and design,  
Write for your audience  
Like everything else about usability and accessibility, plain language  
starts from people, and making information appropriate for the audi-  
ence. On today’s web, we design \(and write\) for diverse, sometimes large  
audiences. Writing in plain language does not mean oversimplifying or  
dumbing down the content. But even technical audiences appreciate  
clear communication that gets to the point, with content that is easy to  
understand instead of convoluted sentences and overblown language.  
Finding a universal language may be difficult when there is a wide  
audience, but the effort pays off in making it easier for all visitors to  
understand the information on the site. After all, assistive technology  
can’t change the words as easily as a stylesheet can change the font, size,  
or color of the text … yet.  
Follow plain language guidelines for writing content  
Writing content in plain language focuses on the readers. You want them  
to find, understand, and use the information, so you make sure they can  
read quickly and accurately.  
You might also think that writing for the web is different than other  
writing, but research suggests that guidelines for print and web are very  
similar. The differences are based on the genre or the type of information  
being presented. The important consideration for deciding which guide-  
lines to follow is the type of information, especially for information that  
appears both in print and online.  
130 Chapter 8 Types of Literacy  
Literacy is not just a question of being able to read, but also whether  
the reader can understand and act on the information. The U.S.  
National Assessment of Adult Literacy identifies three types of lit-  
eracy as they measure how well adults can use printed and written  
communication in their daily lives.  
• Prose literacy\: Reading and using information in prose form, such  
as brochures, news stories, or instructional materials.  
• Document literacy\: Reading and using noncontinuous texts in  
formats such as job applications, payroll forms, transportation  
schedules, or drug and food labels.  
• Quantitative literacy\: Identifying, understanding, and perform-  
ing computations such as balancing a checkbook, calculating a tip,  
or completing an order form.  
Looking across all three types of literacy, they identified four levels  
of literacy\:  
• Below basic\: The most simple and concrete literacy skills, such as  
searching a short, simple text to find out what a patient is allowed  
to drink before a medical test.  
• Basic\: Skills necessary to perform simple and everyday literacy  
activities, such as comparing ticket prices for two events or read-  
ing a pamphlet for jurors.  
• Intermediate\: Ability to perform moderately challenging lit-  
eracy activities including using quantitative information to solve  
problems, like calculating the total cost of ordering specific office  
supplies from a catalog.  
• Proficient\: Skills necessary to perform more complex and chal-  
lenging literacy activities, such as interpreting a table about blood  
pressure, age, and physical activity.  
The latest report shows that 14% of adults in the U.S. have below basic  
levels of prose literacy. For more statistics and how the data was col-  
lected, you can read the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy,

Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 131 Organize the information from the reader’s perspective. Put the  
sections of the site, page, section or sentence in a logical order for your  
readers. Order is especially important for instructions, but this guideline  
applies to any information. Think about what information your readers  
need first.  
Put the “if” before the “then.” Make sure that the context is clear right  
at the beginning of the sentence or paragraph. Putting information in  
the right order is a kind of wayfinding at the sentence level, helping users  
figure out whether they need to read the rest of the conversation. Putting  
information in a logical order makes it more accessible to people who  
don’t read well, who read slowly, or who are listening to content in audio.  
• Use introductory phrases or sentences to announce the topic before  
you dive into the details.  
• If you are listing options, put the condition first, then what happens  
in this situation. \(“If you are sending a gift, write the message for the  
gift card here.”\)  
• If the options are for people in different roles, there is an implicit con-  
dition \(“If you are a student …”\). Put it first.  
• Put instructions in the order in which they must be completed.1  
Break up walls of words. Break the information into short, manageable  
pieces. These breaks should not be arbitrary, but should help read-  
ers understand the information better by creating a logical structure.  
Shorter sections and paragraphs also create white space, and make the  
content seem more approachable.  
Use lots of \(useful\) headings. Create meaningful, useful headings for  
each section. Good headings communicate the structure and key points  
of your content, helping readers scan to the right section. Headings can  
be questions \(“Why do we use headings?”\), statements \(“Headings help  
guide readers”\), or topics \(“Good headings”\).  
Talk to your readers. It’s OK to get personal and talk directly, using  
“you.” Or you can use the imperative to tell readers what they have to do.  
Talking directly to your readers makes a better conversation.  
1 Steehouder, M. F. and Jansen, C. J. M. \(1996\) “The Sequential Order of Instructions\:  
Impact on Text Quality” in Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Conference of the  
Society for Technical Communication.  
132 Chapter 8 Make your writing active. Write in the active voice \(most of the time\).  
Passive sentences sound weak, and don’t make a good call to action.  
Active writing includes an actor\: “You ordered this product on March 19,  
2012” is stronger than “The product was ordered on March 19, 2012.”  
Put the action in the verbs. Use simple, clear verbs instead of hiding the  
action in a noun. Write “Pay by credit card” not “Make a payment using a  
credit card.” \(In this example, “pay” is an active verb, while “payment” is a  
noun form that uses the weaker “make” as the verb.\) Putting the action in  
the verb uses fewer words, emphasizes the action, and is just plain clearer.  
Use bulleted lists \(where appropriate\). When you have a list of items,  
or a collection of conditions, use bulleted lists or tables to make it easy to  
see how many different things you are talking about.  
Support users through their tasks  
If you stay focused on the purpose of the site, it’s a lot easier to decide  
what to say. Whether you are writing content for an informational web-  
site or for a complex, interactive application, the goal of your words is  
to support people in meeting their goals. The menus, titles, links, field  
labels, prompts, and instructions all have to work together, and they  
have to work with everything else about the product design.  
When you organize the information from the reader’s perspective and  
talk directly to the readers, supporting users is easier. For example,  
Figure 8.1 shows the result of a self-assessment quiz to help individuals  
understand their risk of colon cancer. This content doesn’t lecture or try  
to teach too much medical science. Instead, it provides clear information  
and possible actions to address the users’ real goal\: finding out how they  
can stay healthy.  
• The page starts with the simplest possible statement of the results,  
that “Compared to a typical woman your age, your risk is much  
below average.”  
• The next paragraph explains what this risk means, tailored to the  
actual results.  
• The results are shown graphically, reinforcing the meaning, with  
links to more detailed information.  
• Even the results are interactive, letting users see how much they can  
affect their own level of risk.  
• The page ends with a list of the things the user is doing right, encour-  
aging good habits.

Structure the whole page for  
scanning and understanding  
Users don’t think about “the content” separately from “the page,” so you  
shouldn’t either. Structure the page, content, and presentation so that  
they all work together to communicate clearly. Here are three basic  
guidelines to use to support scanning\:  
• Break up walls of words.  
• Use \(correctly tagged\) bullets for lists.  
• Use lots of \(useful\) headings.  
Another way to structure content to support scanning is by consider-  
ing how much information readers need at each place, and structuring  
information to lead from simpler to more detailed explanations. This  
“layering” of information can be as simple as creating a good organiza-  
tion within a single page, or by using “progressive disclosure,” to allow  
users to reveal more detailed information. \(See Chapter 10, “Universal  
Usability,” Design for exploration and discovery for more information on  
134 Chapter 8 progressive disclosure.\) Done correctly, this approach meets the needs of  
visual and verbal learners, people who don’t read well, those who prefer  
numbers, and people using screen readers.  
Figure 8.2 from the Career One Stop site is a good example of how to struc-  
ture information. The chart and associated data shows that people with  
more education both earn more and are less likely to be unemployed.  
FIGURE 8. 2  
Career One Stop,  
a website for job  
seekers, includes  
charts showing what  
makes a difference  
in employment and  
earnings. \(Numbers  
in the image match  
the list below.\) \(www.  
careerinfonet.org/  
finaidadvisor/earnings.  
aspx?nodeid=21\)  
To make the findings clear and comprehensible, the page has\:  
1\. 2. A meaningful title that sums up the point the authors want to  
make\: “More education means more money” \(instead of “Earnings  
and Education”\).  
A short summary paragraph that adds a little more detail, but  
still aims to make the point in a very concise way. It says, “You will  
earn more if you have more education. You will also be less likely to  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 135 become unemployed. A survey from 2010 shows that average earn-  
ings grow from \$454 to \$626 per week, just by earning a high school  
diploma. Getting a college Bachelor’s degree increases average earn-  
ings to \$1,025 per week. More education pays off in higher earnings.”  
3\. The data in a graph. The graph is formatted to make it easier to add  
labels, putting the data into numbers, as well as showing it visu-  
ally. For screen readers, the alternative \(alt\) text for the image says  
“Chart of data table below.” The colors of the bars work in grayscale  
and for people with color blindness.  
4\. The data is presented in a table, so that people who prefer numbers  
or who cannot see the chart easily have access to the information.  
In addition to structuring the information visually, make sure that it is  
structured semantically with good markup. Semantic markup allows  
people using assistive technology to scan, for example, document  
headings and jump quickly to different sections. \(We discuss seman-  
tic markup in more detail in Chapter 4, “Solid Structure,” Use semantic  
markup for content.\)  
• Use heading tags, nested in the correct order for headings.  
• Use tags for bulleted and numbered lists.  
• Use tables appropriately, with tags for header rows  
Write sentences and paragraphs for easy scanning  
You can also structure sentences for easy scanning by putting keywords  
at the beginning of the sentence. Visual readers can easily scan down  
the page. There are two common patterns for scanning a page visually  
\(shown in Figure 8.3\). When scanning a page, the eyes move down the  
page in an “F” pattern, reading a few words at the beginning of each  
line or paragraph. In contrast, in steady reading, the eye tracks across  
each line, reading each word. People using screen readers can also scan,  
because they don’t have to listen to the whole sentence, link, or bullet to  
find the information they want.

patterns. \(a\) Steady reading pattern.

Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 137 Reading is hard for me.  
It takes me a long time to read things. My  
teachers want me to work on my vocabu-  
lary, but I’d rather just find easier pages  
to read. Instructions are really hard for  
me. Going back and forth between the  
Trevor  
instructions and what I have to do is very,  
very distracting. Sometimes I’m trying to  
read, and I get interested in something on the side of the page  
and forget what I’m supposed to be doing. But sometimes, I  
get really involved in what I’m reading and keep going, even af-  
ter I found what I’m looking up. It can take me a very long time  
to do any homework assignment. I wish websites were more  
like books, with nothing to distract me.  
Write helpful links  
Make link text meaningful. The text of a link should clearly and unam-  
biguously tell the reader where the link points.  
• If the link points to anything other than another web page—to PDF,  
Word, or other files—say so in the text of the link \(“My Presentation  
\(PPT\)”\). Some sites suggest adding the file size as well \(“My Presenta-  
tion \(PDF 645Kb\)”\).  
• If you have a list of similar links, put the most meaningful word at the  
beginning of the link text. This makes it easier for users to scan the  
list quickly \(either visually or in audio\). See Figure 8.4.  
Combining links and images. It’s common to combine several ele-  
ments, such as an image and text, to provide a “teaser” link to the full  
article. When each element is coded individually, the result is multiple  
links to the same destination, which can be confusing and tiresome to,  
for example, screen reader and keyboard users who tab from link to link.  
The best approach is to combine the elements into one descriptive link to  
provide a single point of access \(see Figure 8.5\).  
“Read more” links. Watch out for links that repeat the same word over  
and over. It’s tempting to add a link that says “Read more …” at the end of  
a summary, but it’s just as easy, and clearer, to link the headline instead.  
Your goal is to make the linked text be clear enough for users to under-  
stand it, even out of context. Screen reader users will often review a list  
of the links on the page even before reading the page to get an overview  
of the content.  
138 Chapter 8 FIGURE 8.4  
In a usability study, Mary Frances Theofanos and Ginny Redish found that blind  
users “scan with their ears,” listening to just enough to decide whether to listen  
further. Scanning can be difficult when links are repetitive and not descriptive, as  
illustrated in this JAWS Links List. \(Read about the study\: Theofanos, M. F. and  
Redish, J. C., 2003, “Guidelines for Accessible and Usable Websites\: Observing  
Users Who Work with Screen Readers,” Interactions, X \(6\), November–December,  
38–51\. \(www.redish.net/content/papers/interactions.html\)  
The title attribute. When writing links, don’t be tempted to rely on the  
title attribute to make sense of the link. Browsers and screen readers  
each handle title differently, so the attribute is not a reliable way to add  
information to a link. More importantly, don’t provide the same informa-  
tion in the title and link text, or in the title and alt text for an image.  
Many content management tools prompt users to add a title when  
creating a link and adding an image. The title attribute should be  
unnecessary, with well-written links and appropriate image alt text.  
Unfortunately, CMS users often repeat the link or alt text in the title  
field. As a result, the web is cluttered with repetitive tooltips.  
FIGURE 8.5  
In the first example, screen  
reader users will hear the link  
to “Mercado de San Miguel”  
only once because the image  
has null alt text. In the second  
example, the title attribute  
causes a tooltip to appear over  
the link, and may mean the  
name of the park is repeated.  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 139 Use language your audience is familiar  
with or provide definitions  
Writing for your audience means using terminology your audience  
understands. We’ve emphasized “your audience” because we are not sug-  
gesting that all content needs to be reduced to one-syllable words. Plain,  
accessible language is language that fits the context and the audience.  
On the web, it can be hard to know exactly who is reading your content,  
or how familiar they are with the subject, so it’s safest not to make any  
assumptions. Provide definitions for unusual words, words used in a spe-  
cific way in your context, and for all abbreviations. You can use layering  
to let users drill down to the level of information they need\:  
• Define terms in the text. Explain a concept and then introduce the  
technical term.  
• Use a glossary. Quick definitions can be presented in a smaller sec-  
ond window, allowing users to easily return to the same spot in the  
main page. Be sure to give the window a meaningful title.  
• Link to more detailed information. Keep definitions short by link-  
ing to a full page if there are more details that users might find useful.  
In addition to terminology, “language” can mean a language like Spanish  
or English. Help screen readers pronounce words correctly by marking  
the language in the code. You can set the language for the whole page, or  
if there is more than one language on a page, you can add codes to mark  
changes from one language to another.  
Provide plain language summaries  
of complex content  
If it is not possible to write in sufficiently plain language, provide an  
alternative version or a simplified summary. Not only will it help make  
your site more accessible for people with reading disabilities, but you  
might also find that it helps rushed readers as well. For example, Lainey  
Feingold’s website contains articles about her legal work for accessibility  
rights. All of the pages include simplified summaries that describe the  
main point on the page \(shown in Figure 8.6\).  
When including simplified summaries, consider how they will be placed  
on the page early in the design process. They need to be easy to find  
for people who need them, but not presented in a way that is intrusive  
or confusing.  
140 Chapter 8 FIGURE 8.6  
This summary is from a page that describes an agreement with the American  
Cancer Society. http\://lflegal.com/2011/03/acs-info/  
The U.S. National Cancer Institute Fact Sheets on cancer topics include  
a box with Key Points at the top of the page \(see Figure 8.7\). These sum-  
maries are useful for patients and other members of the general public  
because some of the topics include detailed medical information. The  
NCI web content team worried that the summaries might be a barrier for  
health professionals by suggesting that the entire page is as simple as the  
key points. But when they tested the design, professionals said they rec-  
ognized that “boxes like those” were simple summaries for patients, and  
just skipped over them.

needs to know. \(www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/bone\)  
Alt text for online editions is included here so that it’s handy. It does not  
appear on the printed page, and is not bulleted.  
Don’t rely on readability formulas  
Many people have the misconception that plain language can be defined  
by testing the content for reading level or grade level. Readability for-  
mulas may seem like a way to define clear writing, but they are not a  
very good way of evaluating plain language. The reason is simple\: these  
formulas work by counting syllables in words and words in sentences,  
and those counts have very little to do with whether the information is  
readable. They also ignore an important part of the definition of plain  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 141 Easy Read  
Easy Read is a program in the U.K. aimed at providing information that people  
with learning disabilities need to know—government policies and benefits.  
Their guidelines include how the text is both written and presented to make  
information clear for people who do not read well. You can download the  
complete set of guidelines, but the most important concepts are drawn from  
principles for both plain language and clean presentation\:  
• Present each main idea in both words and pictures. Each picture should clearly  
illustrate a single idea, and not be used for more than one idea in a document.  
• Break up text to highlight important points with bullets, boxed text, and  
bold text.  
• Highlight difficult words the first time they appear and put an explanation  
immediately after the word.  
• Use a simple sans-serif font at a minimum of 16 points.  
• Use color to draw attention.  
• Use a lot of white space, both around the text and between lines.  
Easy Read is not universal design but an alternative version. However, creating an Easy  
Read version is a good way to think about the most important points being communi-  
cated. One way to think about Easy Read is that it is a concise summary of the content.  
Figure 8.8 shows two versions of a document—the text version and the Easy Read  
version—side-by-side. The same questions are presented in both plain language  
and an Easy Read simplified version.

142 Chapter 8 language\: that the content is written for the readers. Formulas can let  
you know if text is not plain, but they cannot tell you if you have written  
in a way that is useful for the audience.  
Readability formulas do have one use\: as an early warning system. They  
can be a way of checking whether you have too many long sentences or  
multi-syllable words, but not much more.  
In her talk, “The Right to Understand,” at TEDxO’Porto, Sandra Fisher-  
Martins says that the percentage of people who read at different levels of  
literacy made her realize that not being able to read is a kind of disabil-  
ity. In Portugal, 50% of people read at the lowest level \(shown as figures  
in red in Figure 8.9\) compared to just 5% in Sweden.

Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 143 Usability test your content  
Too often, we test the structure and templates for a site, but don’t test  
with real content, even though the “content” is often the real reason  
visitors come to the site. Including real content from the beginning of a  
project, from the first wireframe, has several benefits.  
• The content team—content strategists, authors, multimedia produc-  
ers, and other contributors—has an active part in the project from the  
beginning. They can provide samples of all types of information, so  
the overall product design fits the content well, and vice versa.  
• Test content early to check the “voice” of the site, whether the termi-  
nology is meaningful, and whether there is the right amount of detail.  
• Users can react to the site in a more natural way. Greeking2 text  
\(blocks of text with words like “lorem ipsum” instead of real content\)  
is often confusing to test participants.  
# Who Is Responsible for Plain Language?  
Plain language is content, so content strategists, authors, editors, and  
other contributors have the primary responsibility for making sure that  
all of the information on the site is written using language appropriate  
for the audience.  
• Formatted for scanning, using headings and breaking up walls  
of words.  
• Formatted with semantic markup.  
Some aspects of plain language are implemented in design and code.  
Those teams support the content authors with clear presentation and  
structural support for plain language. Remember that there is a lot of  
language in the interface\: in the form of button labels, navigational links,  
section titles, and more. Those need to be written in plain language, no  
matter who writes them.  
In addition, features that support plain language need to be designed  
and built into the product. This starts with a stylesheet that supports  
clean presentation and semantic coding that fits the content.  
2 The text comes from an old text by Cicero. Using those words as placeholder text  
goes back to the beginning of printing. It’s called “Greeking” the text because you  
aren’t expected to understand it. www.lipsum.com/  
144 Chapter 8 WCAG 2.0 and Plain Language  
The guidelines for Plain Language map to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
A site with plain language is Understandable, written for the audience.  
A site with plain language meets the guidelines\:  
• 3.1 Readable\: Make text content readable and understandable  
\(Guideline\).  
The requirements for plain language are\:  
• 2.4.6 and 2.4.10 Headings and Labels\: Headings and labels describe  
topic or purpose \(Level AA\) and are used to organize the content  
\(Level AAA\).  
• 2.4.4 and 2.4.9 Link Purpose\: The purpose of each link can be deter-  
mined from the link text alone \(Level AAA\) or from the link text  
together with the context \(Level A\).  
• 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 Language of Page/Parts\: The default human lan-  
guage of each web page \(Level A\) or of each passage or phrase in the  
content \(Level AA\) is defined in code.  
• 3.1.3 Unusual Words\: The site includes definitions of words or  
phrases used in an unusual or restricted way, including idioms and  
jargon \(Level AAA\).  
• 3.1.4 Abbreviations\: The meaning of abbreviations is available  
\(Level AAA\).  
• 3.1.6 Pronunciation\: There is a way to identify the pronunciation of  
words where the meaning of the words is ambiguous without the pro-  
nunciation \(Level AAA\).  
• 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions\: Labels or instructions are provided  
when content requires user input \(Level A\).  
• 3.3.5 Help\: Context-sensitive help is available \(Level AAA\).  
• 3.1.5 Reading Level\: When text requires reading ability beyond a  
lower secondary education level, a simplified summary or version is  
available \(Level AAA\).  
The full text of the WCAG 2.0 requirements can be found in Appendix B.  
Plain Language\: Creates a Conversation 145 Summary  
Plain language involves accessibility for content, helping everyone  
read more accurately and efficiently. Writing in plain language does  
not mean “dumbing down” the information. It means writing for the  
audience, using words and concepts they will understand.  
Plain language and clean presentation work together—both rely on  
structuring the content well and designing or writing to support  
comprehension. Well-written headings support users in scanning  
the page, whether they are reading visually or through the semantic  
structure of the page.  
Content at the word, sentence, paragraph, and page level can all be  
made easier to read by following guidelines for plain language to  
write clearly and in a way that’s easy to scan.  
Be sure to test for plain language through usability testing, not  
through reading level metrics, which do little more than count  
words and syllables.  
146 Chapter 8 Profile\: Universal Plain Language with Ginny Redish  
Ginny Redish has been helping people write clearly for all  
of her career. She does research and analysis to understand  
what’s hard about reading and writing, and follows up with  
guidelines that people can use to make reading and  
writing easier.  
In our experience, language and content often get less attention than other  
elements in design projects. We wanted to learn from Ginny how to make  
language more of a priority.  
Plain language is important for accessibility.  
Plain language is all about accessibility—making information understandable  
for everyone. “It’s not a matter of dumbing down. It’s a matter of meeting people  
where they are and saving people’s time.”  
Plain language is particularly important on “functional websites,” where people  
go to get information and accomplish tasks. The goal is that “people can find  
what they need, understand what they find, and use that to accomplish whatever  
it is they need to accomplish.” Providing that experience to the broadest range of  
users is the goal of universal plain language.  
We all have difficulty reading at some time or another, for physical or cognitive  
reasons, or when encountering an unknown topic or language. “Even people who  
read with high literacy sometimes have problems reading—when they are under  
stress, or when it’s an unfamiliar topic.” In the end, “plain language is valuable—  
even necessary—to just about everybody.”  
When you use plain language, “people can find what they need, understand what  
they find, and use that to accomplish whatever it is they need to accomplish.”  
And plain does not mean dull. “It’s not a matter of dumbing down. It’s a matter  
of meeting people where they are and saving people’s time. People don’t come to  
functional websites to waste time. They are very busy with other parts of their  
lives. They need to be able to find, understand, and use the information in the  
time and effort that they think it’s worth.”  
Can one source of information work for everyone? “If you write your main con-  
tent in plain language, you are going to reach a wide range of your audience,” but  
there are times when “different audiences need different content.” The decision  
to create different content should be undertaken deliberately and with cau-  
tion because alternate versions are frequently neglected. “Separate but equal is  
never equal.”

Design projects need content people.  
The need to make decisions about the right content for the audience illustrates  
the importance of having a content strategist on the design team. Typically,  
teams don’t consider content until the very end of the design process, and then  
content providers scramble to replace “lorem ipsum” placeholder text with  
actual information. And more often than not, the people producing the words  
are not trained as writers, never mind in the techniques of plain language. As a  
result, the very thing people come for—information—is often the most poorly  
implemented part of a design.  
People who come to websites don’t come to navigate. They don’t come to admire  
your design. Obviously, the design and navigation are potential barriers, and  
they have to be good so as not to be barriers. But what people come for is the  
content, and the content is both information design and language. Under-  
standing its importance and making content an integral part of the process is  
critical. Plain language must be part of the design process from the start.  
Implementing plain language in the design process requires content people, real  
content, and a commitment to conversation. Every project should have profes-  
sional content people on the team from the start—people who know how to write  
“clearly and conversationally.”  
Secondly, real content for the site should be in place from the very beginning of  
the process, and tested and modified throughout the process, along with other  
design elements. Ginny urges, “No more lorem ipsum!”  
Finally, the design team should adopt a philosophy based on engaging in a con-  
versation. “Your content strategy can’t be a one-way spewing of information. It  
needs to be answering site visitors’ questions. And if you think about content as  
a conversation, you are much more likely to write in plain language.”  
Making a commitment to plain language and integrating plain language into the  
design process improve accessibility in an integrated and holistic way. No one is  
adversely affected by language that is clear and to the point—in fact, everyone  
understands better. Working toward the goal of universal plain language is one  
of the best ways to improve the user experience for everyone.  
One of the most interesting aspects of the ADA movement has been how often  
something created to meet the needs of a special group of people has turned  
out to be useful for everybody. Plain language is the same. People think of  
plain language for a low literacy audience. But when we simplify and clarify  
for a low literacy audience, high literacy people benefit just as much and  
sometimes even more.

# Closed Captions  
Public screens, in airports or on the side of a building, are examples  
of the many places where closed captions allow everyone to watch  
televisions without sound—even when driving by.  
Perhaps the most common accessible medium is closed captioning for  
television programs. Closed captioning was developed to make programs  
accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Television screens in  
airports, shops, gyms, and bars often play with the sound turned off and  
captions turned on.  
In many countries, closed captions are required by law or provided rou-  
tinely on most television programs. In the U.S., for example, the first closed  
captioning service started in the 1980s and is now part of virtually all broad-  
cast and cable television programming. It was invented by PBS, NIST, and  
ABC-TV, earning a technology Emmy Award. The first TV show with closed  
captions was an episode of The Mod Squad \(open captions were available  
even earlier, starting in 1972 on Julia Child’s French Chef \). The 21st Century  
Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 requires captions for  
TV programs shown on the Internet, if they were previously captioned, but  
does not cover programs shown only online. In most of the principles we have discussed so far, making websites or  
apps accessible does not require much beyond good design or devel-  
opment practice. You may have to learn a few new techniques, but  
once you do, accessibility becomes second nature.  
Creating accessible media is different. With media, you have to do some-  
thing extra to make it accessible—captions for the sounds in audio or  
video and descriptions for visual images. These alternatives must be  
built into the media or site explicitly because images, audio, and video  
do not contain information in a form that allows current technology to  
read them directly.  
# How Accessible Media  
# Supports Accessibility  
Making media accessible is critical for a simple reason\: without alterna-  
tives, the information in images, audio, and video is completely hidden  
from some people. This creates an absolute barrier to understanding  
the content and a generally frustrating experience for people who can’t  
access the information.  
Although there are different techniques for making images and motion  
media accessible, the basic principle is the same\: provide alternatives so  
that they work for all senses.  
With accessible media, people can understand and use information  
contained in media, such as images, audio, video, animation, and  
presentations.  
• Information in media is available to everyone. You can’t see the  
experience of time-based media here, on a printed page, but you can  
look at the difference accessible images make in a web experience. By  
providing alternative text, the information is available to both people  
who can see the images and people who need text that can be read  
out loud \(see Figure 9.1\). Similarly, captions and video description  
make video accessible to people who cannot hear the audio.  
• People have alternative ways to consume information. Making  
media accessible helps people with disabilities, but it also helps people  
in situations that limit their use of sight or hearing\: noisy spaces, places  
where they cannot make noise without disturbing others, low light, or  
bright light. Another consideration is that we all use our senses in dif-  
ferent ways. Some people prefer to learn through visual concepts and  
presentations, some prefer to learn by reading, and others by doing.  
Building in options with media alternatives helps everyone.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 151 a b  
FIGURE 9.1  
Without alternative text for images, information can disappear for screen read-  
ers or people using a text view. With alternatives, they can have an equivalent  
experience. \(a\) This is the default view of the National Park Service site. \(b\)  
With images turned off, the content images are replaced with alternative text.  
When I hear and see it, health  
information makes more sense.  
My new phone is so good for my work. I  
don’t have to carry around so much paper  
because I can pull it up from my book-  
marks. I even tried watching one of my  
Maria  
health educator’s videos, but the captions  
were hard to read on the phone. Those  
captions are very nice. I can see the words spelled out while  
I hear them, so I learn how to spell them, too. It’s also nice to  
give videos to my clients. Sometimes they don’t read English  
well, but they can listen OK.  
# How to Design for Accessible Media  
The simplest guideline for thinking about universal design for any kind  
of media is to use multiple communication methods. Most importantly,  
don’t rely on just one sense, such as sight, color perception, or hearing.  
152 Chapter 9 Don’t use only color to communicate meaning  
One of the first rules of accessibility that many people learn is “not by  
color alone.” This doesn’t mean not to use color at all—far from it. Color  
is an important part of design. It just means you must use redundant  
cues of shape, position, or text to reinforce the meaning \(see Table 9.1\).  
This guideline applies to symbols, graphs and charts, and the color com-  
binations for text and the background in any medium, including images,  
presentations, animations, and information in a video.  
TaBLe 9.1 COLOR + ANOTHER CUE = MEANING FOR ALL  
Ways to create meaning Image with color and in shades of gray  
These symbols are  
meaningless without color.  
In this example, green and  
red diamonds show whether  
the product has a feature or  
not.  
Use position.  
In this example, the symbols  
are placed in columns under  
the headings “Yes” and “No.”  
Use different symbols.  
In this example, the symbol  
for Yes is a green check,  
and the symbol for No is a  
red “x.” If these symbols are  
images, they can also have  
alt text that spells out the  
meaning.  
Use words.  
In this example, the word  
Yes is green, and the word  
No is red.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 153 A Symbol Language for Color  
Designer Miguel Neiva realized that as color becomes a more and more critical  
part of communication, the 350 million people \(including 10% of men\) with some  
type of color blindness are easily left out.  
His solution is a symbol language called ColorADD Color Identification System,  
shown in Figure 9.2, in which shape can communicate color. It works by using a  
small set of symbols that start with blue, yellow, and red, and mix those symbols  
to show the major colors on the spectrum.  
His vision is that these symbols could appear on clothing labels or any product  
in a color, but also for healthcare uses like safety labels, and color-coded patient  
wrist bands that patients wear.  
FIGURE 9. 2  
ColorADD Color Identification System symbols on a set of colored pencils  
show how they can work in practice. \(www.coloradd.net\)  
Provide instructions without relying on visual cues  
When communicating information through color, remember that the  
need to provide information for all senses applies to instructions, too. If  
you tell someone who can’t see color to “click on the green button,” or “fill  
in the fields highlighted in yellow,” those instructions are just not useful.  
Similarly, the information that a heading is on the right side of the page  
is not useful for someone using an audio interface.  
Don’t use descriptions of the color, shape, or location of an element as  
the only cues for how to find it. Name elements in the interface with the  
text label, so that users can identify and locate them accurately, no mat-  
ter how they are accessing the page.  
154 Chapter 9 Describe the content or meaning of images  
When you put an image on a page, you do so for a reason. The image  
communicates visually, so you also need to communicate the same  
information as text. You do this by using “alternative text,” or alt text,  
inside the image tag. Browsers use the alt text in place of images that are  
not displayed or are not accessible to the user.  
For example, when a screen reader finds an image, it announces that  
it has found an image, and reads any alt text. In this way, the alt text  
replaces the image for non-visual access.  
CREDIT\: J. AND K. HOLLINGSWORTH/USFWS  
FIGURE 9.3  
Depending on the  
purpose of this image  
in the page, the alt  
text might read\:  
“Red fox” or “Red  
fox at Sachuest Point  
National Wildlife Ref-  
uge,” or “A red fox,  
standing alone on a  
pile of rocks, looks  
back at the camera.”  
To write useful alt text, you must decide how best to describe the image  
to communicate an equivalent meaning. To do this well, you have to  
think about the purpose of the image and its context of use \(see Fig-  
ure 9.3\), including whether there is information in the image that is not  
repeated elsewhere in the content. When alt text is too long, or has more  
information than is really meaningful, it can be distracting instead of  
adding to the experience.  
The only absolute rule for writing alternative text is that every image  
must include an alt attribute.  
The following guidelines will help you write useful, meaningful alt text.  
Repeat words from the image. If an image contains text in graphical  
form, repeat the same words in the alt text. Unless there is meaningful  
information in how the text is presented, don’t add words describing the  
color or other decorative elements. \(See Figure 9.4.\)  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 155 Figure 9.4  
The alternative text for this image should repeat  
the words in the image\: “Webcast\: Applying 21st  
Century Toxicology to Green Chemical and Material  
Design, September 20-21, 2011.”  
The best practice is to use HTML text whenever possible, rather than text  
in a graphical format, as text in an image cannot be read by software.  
\(See Chapter 4, “Solid Structure,” Code content to be machine-readable.\)  
Use blank alt text for decorative images. If an image is used purely for  
decoration, don’t clutter the interface by describing it. For these images,  
include the alt attribute, but leave its value blank\: alt=”” \(that is, ‘quote  
quote’, with no space in between\). This is called “null alt text.” It allows  
software to distinguish between images that are purely decorative and  
should not be communicated to the user and images where no one both-  
ered to provide alt text. \(See Figure 9.5.\)  
This category of images includes\:  
• Icons that duplicate information already in the text  
• Graphical bullets  
• Decorative separators or icons that only have meaning in the  
visual layout  
Figure 9.5  
Icons that reinforce links should have null alt text since their purpose is purely  
visual. With null alt text, screen reader software will skip over the images and  
read only the links.  
156 Chapter 9 Describe images in a meaningful way. For images that add visual  
interest to a headline or paragraph of text, you can choose to\:  
• Provide a very brief description of the content of the image, in order to  
communicate the impact of the image in words.  
• Use null alt text if the image is generic rather than an illustration of a  
specific person, event, or place, but only if there is no extra informa-  
tion communicated by the picture.  
Identify the target of a link. If the image is a link, write the alt text as  
though you were writing link text, describing the link destination as  
opposed to the image.  
It’s particularly important to supply alt text when an image is used as a  
link. Without alt text, screen readers have nothing other than the image  
file name to describe the link, which in most cases is not that descriptive.  
If a linked image is associated with a text link, you can use null alt text  
so the user won’t have to hear the same words twice.  
Don’t use a file name or other technical information. This might be  
helpful to you as the author, but it’s not very helpful or a good experi-  
ence for the user. Some web authoring programs automatically insert file  
names into the alt text. These images will pass a test for alternative text,  
meeting the letter of the rule, but not the spirit.  
Only use background images for decorative effects. Background  
images can provide a visual effect like color or texture to the whole page.  
Background images added using CSS do not have alternative text avail-  
able to a screen reader. If the image is purely decorative, the missing alt  
text is not a problem, but if the image adds meaning, be sure that any  
information is duplicated in HTML text content.  
Beyond these basics, you have to make decisions about how to write the  
most usable and meaningful alt text based on the context and what is in  
the caption. The real test of good alternative text for images is whether the  
page communicates just as well, providing equivalent information and an  
equally good experience, both with and without seeing the images.  
Provide captions and descriptions for video  
Captions are the words that appear at the bottom of a video screen, pro-  
viding a text version of the audio track. They always include the words  
spoken in the video. They should also include all significant audio con-  
tent, such as a phone ringing, horns honking, music playing, or other  
sounds that are important in understanding the meaning.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 157 Images That Require Long Descriptions  
One of the hot debates as we write this book is what happens with detailed  
images, such as diagrams, illustrations, and charts, that need more description.  
In HTML 4.01, an image tag can contain a “longdesc” attribute to provide a link  
to a page containing a long description of the image. Unfortunately, the attribute  
has been implemented erratically and is therefore not used much. Images need-  
ing more lengthy descriptions are often described in alt text or not at all.  
Look at Figure 9.6 and see what you think. In this image, the long description  
is contained in the alt text, providing details about what is shown in the image\:  
“Anatomy of the pancreas; drawing shows the pancreas, stomach, spleen, liver,  
gallbladder, bile ducts, colon, and small intestine. An inset shows the head, body,  
and tail of the pancreas. The bile duct and pancreatic duct are also shown.”  
The caption describes the purpose of the image\: “Anatomy of the pancreas. The  
pancreas has three areas\: head, body, and tail. It is found in the abdomen near the  
stomach, intestines, and other organs.”  
FIGURE 9.6  
A medical illustration  
showing the anatomy  
of the pancreas.  
The “longdesc” attribute was dropped from the HTML5 specification, and since  
then there has been much debate over how to replace it. Steve Faulkner, profiled  
in Chapter 6, “Helpful Wayfinding,” has been in the middle of the work to find a  
solution, so that it’s easy to provide links between images and long descriptions.  
While there’s still some debate over whether “longdesc” should be part of the  
spec, it’s not a safe option for providing long descriptions. Steve offers practi-  
cal guidance on ways to provide text alternatives in “HTML5\: Techniques for  
Providing Useful Text Alternatives” \(http\://dev.w3.org/html5/alt-techniques/  
developer.html\).  
158 Chapter 9 Without captions, it’s meaningless  
to me.  
I love that there is so much visual  
information on the web, but when it  
comes to videos, why can’t people take  
the time to include me? For example,  
Steven  
I was trying to learn how to use a new  
application, and the only instructions  
were in a screencast. I could sort of follow what they were  
doing, but when someone interpreted for me, I found out that  
I misunderstood an important point. It makes me so frustrated.  
I’m good at what I do, and don’t like being left out or having to  
ask someone to interpret information for me.  
Video description \(also called audio description or described video\) uses  
the natural pauses in dialogue to add narrative that translates visual  
information into descriptive text, so that blind members of an audi-  
ence have access to this information \(see Table 9.2\). On the web, audio  
description may be provided in several ways\:  
• In the main audio track.  
• In a separate audio track. This allows users to choose to listen to this  
track, but does not work in all media players.  
• In a separate text file or added to an audio transcript.  
Captions are added to a video through a text file that contains both the  
text of the caption and the time codes to tell the video player when to  
display the text. Figure 9.7 shows a sample of a caption file.

Subtitles Translations to a second language.  
Subtitles can also be used for audio that is difficult  
to hear because of background noise, accents, or  
muffled speech.  
Captions A synchronized display of the transcript where the text  
and spoken word are in the same language.  
Captions can be open or closed\:  
•  
Open captions are burned into the video, so that  
everyone sees them.  
•  
Closed captions can be turned on or off, so that they  
are only seen when needed.  
Audio Description/  
Video Description  
Not just what’s said, but a more complete description of  
the action, filling in gaps missing for people who cannot  
hear the audio track, or see the visuals.  
•  
Adds captions for non-speech audio, such as music,  
phone rings, explosions, etc.  
•  
Describes action not spoken in dialogue. For example, if  
there is a loud explosion, the description would include  
what blew up, if it is not obvious from the context.  
The process for creating captions starts with a transcript. Depending on  
how the multimedia was created, you may already have a script that you  
can use as the starting point.  
• A complete script. Videos for e-learning, screencasts, or that use an  
announcer or actors often have a complete script that is an effective  
transcript.  
• A rough script. Speeches or informal presentations’ videos might  
have rough speaker notes that can be a good start on a full transcript.  
• No script. Interviews or journalistic videos often have no script at all,  
so they have to be completely transcribed.  
You then add time-codes, typically using a tool \(like the ones shown in  
Figure 9.8\) to help synchronize the text with the video.

FIGURE 9.8  
\(a\) The Amara \(universalsubtitles.org\) editor makes it easy to see  
how the captions will synchronize with the video. Amara allows you  
to create captions for any video, even if you don’t have access to it on  
the server. \(b\) The Magpie captions editor from NCAM \(ncam.wgbh.  
org\) focuses on displaying the timecodes and associated captions in  
a compact and easy-to-read form.  
As speech-to-text technology has improved, there are now options for  
automatic captions. YouTube, for example, will attempt to create cap-  
tions using automatic speech recognition \(ASR\). The results are often  
not very good unless the audio is clear and the speech distinct. However,  
they can be a good way to get started\: the file provides the time stamps,  
and you can edit the automatically created captions to correct the text.  
Format captions to enhance meaning  
With such a restricted format, you might not think about using text  
styling to enhance meaning \(see Table 9.3\). Subtle uses of spacing, punc-  
tuation, and line breaks can help users read the captions more easily.  
Caption authors can reserve one, two, or more lines of text for cap-  
tions. Long captions will wrap automatically, but it’s a good practice to  
check to be sure that the text is not so long that it’s hard to read, that the  
breaks between captions match the phrasing of the spoken text, and that  
there is enough contrast between the caption text and the background.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 161 TaBLe 9.3 ST YLE CONVENTIONS FOR CAPTIONS  
Line breaks Put line breaks and breaks between captions in  
logical places in the phrasing. This makes it easier to  
follow the meaning of the words.  
The quick brown fox  
jumps over the lazy dog  
Periods Put a period at the end of sentences. Start the new  
sentence with a new caption.  
Welcome to the Twitter translation center.  
In order to help make Twitter available  
to everyone in the world,  
Non-verbal sounds Put non-verbal sounds in parentheses or square  
brackets. Consider naming the title of the song, if it  
is important to the meaning.  
\(dog barking\)  
\[phone ringing ...\]  
\[music playing\: Title of Song\]  
Hang on a sec. \(music stops\)  
Speaker identification If the visual image does not show the person who is  
speaking, or if the audio cuts between two speakers,  
identify the person speaking.  
•  
Use a colon after the name  
•  
Add angle brackets where a new voice starts  
•  
Use ALL CAPS for the name \(if the caption text is  
in mixed case\) or vice versa  
If the video identifies the speaker at the bottom of  
the screen, consider including the title or description,  
because it may be obscured by the caption.  
Examples of four ways to identify speakers or  
indicate when the speaker changes.

162 Chapter 9 Accessible Rhetoric  
Sean Zdenek, a technical communications professor at Texas Tech University, has  
been exploring the rhetoric of captions—that is, the art of discourse and communi-  
cation applied to closed captions. He has tackled issues like how to communicate  
humor, drunken speech, accents, irony, and the meaning of sounds.  
He suggests using parentheticals \(which he calls “manner captions”\) to tell  
readers how the words are pronounced. Think about how much these brief  
descriptions add to your understanding of the story.  
\(WHISPERS\) Don’t go!  
\(IN SILLY VOICE\) And I’ll tell you what the first thing

Examples from “Drunk Speech but Sober Captions” http\://seanzdenek.com/  
Provide alternatives to time-based media  
In addition to captions, but never as a substitute, it can also be useful to  
provide a completely separate alternative for time-based media, such as  
a transcript or a text version of the information with appropriate images.  
These alternatives are useful in many situations\:  
• Users may have a device without audio output or don’t want to use  
audio for some reason of their own.  
• People who do not speak the language well may find it easier to  
understand the information in written form.  
• People who need more time to review and understand verbal informa-  
tion benefit from being able to work at their own pace.  
• A transcript can be printed.  
• Search engines can read the transcript, but not the audio file.  
For a usable, equitable experience, be sure the link to the transcript is easy  
to find near the media controls. Figure 9.9 shows one way to combine a  
video of the presenter, a clear view of the slides, and a synchronized tran-  
script of the text. Users can adjust the size of each window.

Use dynamic elements carefully  
Anyone who spends time on the web will at some point encounter a  
website that overwhelms the senses, with myriad moving, blinking, and  
flashing elements all demanding attention. The experience is unpleasant  
at best. Distractions can seriously impede comprehension and effective  
use by getting in the way of focus. Some types of animation can trigger  
physical reactions, such as seizures and migraines.  
Don’t design with blinking or flashing elements, including tight patterns  
that “animate” organically, with closely spaced lines or dots that visually  
vibrate. No one wants to create a design that might make someone ill!  
In addition, don’t include dynamic elements that engage without user  
request, such as a video that plays automatically when the page loads, a  
page that refreshes automatically, or a slideshow that advances auto-  
matically. These involuntary actions can be disruptive for all users  
and lead to all sorts of coping behaviors—for example, narrowing the  
browser window to hide ads in the right column, browsing with audio  
muted to avoid embarrassing audio outbursts, or waiting through a  
slideshow cycle to finish reading an entry of interest. We have all learned  
how to “tune out” design elements that we think are irrelevant in order  
to cope with distraction—sometimes to our detriment, when elements  
that appear irrelevant are precisely what we are seeking.  
164 Chapter 9 Sign Language Interpretation  
To reach the widest audience, consider providing sign language interpretation.  
This is an advanced option—in WCAG, it’s a Level AAA checkpoint—but one  
worth considering for official information or if you want to reach a deaf audience.  
Sign language is important for a good user experience because some people read  
sign language more easily than text. This is because sign language is a distinct  
language, with its own grammar, word order, and ways of signaling functions like  
asking a question. Most sign languages include gestures and facial expression as  
part of the language, used to add meaning. Sign language isn’t just a word-for-  
word translation of spoken language.  
Watch out for localization issues, too. Sign language is different from country  
to country. There are regional accents and dialects, just as there are in spoken  
language. Native sign language speakers are effectively bilingual, as most under-  
stand both the local sign language and written or spoken language.

Taiwan provide sign  
language interpre-  
tation along with  
captions. \(www.  
openideo.com/open/

accessible-information\)  
Sign interpretation is usually done by a live interpreter, such as the person shown  
in the inset in Figure 9.10, but an interesting new option is sign language ani-  
mations. Instead of using a live interpreter, researchers are working to develop  
systems that can use an animated avatar to sign. None of these projects is quite  
ready for prime time—they are certainly not as good as a live interpreter—but  
they could be a good alternative way to generate sign language from a caption or  
transcript file. This technique is already widely used in educational publishing,  
such as the World Federation of the Deaf 2007 video with animated sign language  
at www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW2KBXrPEdM.

Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 165 Unrequested changes of context can be particularly disruptive for screen  
reader users, who don’t always know when a change of context occurs  
on a page, like a slideshow update or a page refresh. Media files that  
auto-play can be particularly challenging, as the audio from the media  
interferes with screen reader output, making it difficult to find the con-  
trol to stop playback.  
Try to reduce distractions overall and play moving or audible elements  
only on user request. \(See Chapter 5, “Easy Interaction,” Let users control  
the operation of the interface, for more on reducing distractions.\)  
Make presentations accessible  
You might not think of presentations as part of web design, but with so  
many presentations posted online at sites like Slideshare and Vimeo,  
they are also part of the web, so it’s worth considering how accessible  
they are. The work to make your presentation accessible also helps peo-  
ple read the slides, even when they didn’t see your talk \(Figure 9.11\).  
FIGURE 9.11  
Giles Colborne uses a clever design to add a transcript to the presentations  
he posts on the site Slideshare\: he adds a text box that looks like a Post-it  
note with a summary of his talk. Better yet, this takes advantage of the way  
Slideshare displays the text as a transcript at the bottom of the page. \(www.  
slideshare.net/cxpartners/designing-for-delight-giles-colborne\)  
166 Chapter 9 Some features to look for when you upload your slides\:  
• Can users download the presentation, in case they need to adjust the  
display to read the slides? Make the presentation itself accessible, too.  
• Is the text of the slides displayed on the page, to provide an easily  
accessible version? If not, provide a link to the slide text.  
• Is there a way to add a transcript of the verbal presentation?  
You also need to make the presentation itself accessible. In Microsoft  
PowerPoint, you can add alt text to any images and check the reading  
order. You can also use the speaker notes to include longer descriptions  
of any charts, diagrams, or complex images.  
# Who Is Responsible for  
# Accessible Media?  
The most important work in creating accessible media—alternative text,  
captions, and transcripts—is the responsibility of the content team. It  
is up to the authors and producers to provide these text equivalents, to  
make the decisions about what is meaningful \(or not\) in supporting the  
overall content on the site, and to make it easy for users to find links to  
transcripts or other features that support accessible media.  
The whole team also has a responsibility for choosing accessible media  
players or other widgets. This means choosing a player with buttons that  
work through the keyboard and where control icons have good alt text.  
Whether you are building the feature, using a widget from a library, or  
linking to a site like YouTube to embed video, if the player isn’t acces-  
sible, your media won’t be either. Make sure that the media players you  
choose have easy interaction and allow users to select closed captions,  
adjust the audio volume, and set display preferences.  
# WCAG 2.0 and Accessible Media  
The guidelines for accessible media map to the following WCAG 2.0  
requirements.  
A site with plain language is Perceivable, providing alternatives to any  
media that relies on vision or hearing, including audio, video, animation,  
and presentations.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 167 A site with accessible media meets the guidelines\:

content \(Level AAA\).  
The full text of the WCAG 2.0 requirements can be found in Appendix B.  
# Summary  
Creating accessible media requires alternatives, so that the media  
content supports all the senses. It is the one type of content where a  
single version is not enough.  
Types of alternatives include descriptions of images \(called alt text\),  
captions for video files, transcripts for audio files, and descriptions of  
any other non-text content that is not communicated in any other way.  
To support different types of perception, color is used in combina-  
tion with other cues for meaning, and instructions do not rely on  
visual cues.  
Accessible media also includes presentation slides that are posted  
on the web.  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 169 Profile\: Accessible Media with Larry Goldberg  
Larry Goldberg is Director of the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National  
Center for Accessible Media \(NCAM\) at WGBH Boston, one of the most  
accessibility-aware media companies in the world. In addition to pro-  
ducing award-winning, captioned, and described television and web  
programs, WGBH hosts the National Center for Accessible Media, or  
NCAM, a research and development group focused on ensuring equity in  
media access. Larry oversees NCAM, where his dedication to developing technologies,  
policies, and practices to support accessible media has been instrumental in main-  
streaming captions and video description and other innovative technologies.  
We asked Larry what we could learn from the process of bringing captioning to televi-  
sion that will help us mainstream accessible media on the web.  
Integrated technology as the tipping point.  
Captioned television is everywhere—in bars, airports, gyms—but that wasn’t  
always the case. There was a time when captions were delivered via set-top boxes,  
purchased by deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. The tipping point came when the  
capability for displaying captions was built into standard television sets.  
Getting there wasn’t easy. The first step was to dispel the notion that captions were  
costly and benefitted only a small number of viewers. “You don’t want to forget the  
primary purpose—that deaf people needed captions—but when it became obvious  
that captions helped comprehension and late-night television watching, and when  
the TV production community saw that they could integrate captioning into the  
production process without a lot of time and expense, they said, ‘Fine, go ahead.’”  
Most web media players can have caption display capacity built in; however, in  
most cases, captions are not required. In the United States, captioning recently  
became required under the new 21st Century Communications and Video Accessi-  
bility Act \(CVAA\), but only for previously broadcast video, not for user-generated or  
web-only video.  
Becoming part of the process.  
Process integration was key to mainstreaming captions. “We had to work fast so  
we didn’t hold up delivery deadlines.” This meant overnight shifts, better tools  
so captioners could work more quickly, and workflows that would integrate into  
production. “Once captioning became a line-item in budgets, and an expected  
check-point in the production flow, it became an accepted way of doing things.”  
Expectations for captioned television in bars and health clubs also helped. “When a  
TV producer goes to the gym every day and sees captions, and they look and go, ‘Hey!  
There’s an interview on—I want to know what he’s saying!’ Or they’re at a bar and  
170 Chapter 9 there’s a game on, and they say, ‘What just happened? Could somebody turn on the  
captions?’ These wider circles of usage certainly help.”  
Enhancing media with accessible features.  
With web-based digital technology, the broad benefits of accessibility features are  
even greater than with television. “In the earliest days, even in QuickTime 1.0, the  
benefits of searchability were fairly obvious,” offering the ability to find key words in  
a video by searching a synchronized text track.  
There is evidence that the presence of captions increases the attention to and time  
spent with video. “We believe captions are driving viewership and ‘stickiness.’” And  
text has myriad benefits over other media when it comes to sharing. “If you have a  
text file of your media, it’s much more readily shared. And you can tell people about  
it by pulling pieces of text out, posting or tweeting the text, and driving people to  
your media.”  
Making text from audio.  
“It’s the transcribing aspect that takes time.” Most companies outsource because  
the expertise needed is not typically part of the media production team. Services  
like the WGBH Media Access Group make outsourcing easy, and prices have come  
way down. Plus, there’s more to good captions than transcribing audio to text.  
“High-quality captions are crafted to make the captions more readable. Things like  
breaking the sentence in the right place, and removing captions during long pauses.  
Our captioners do everything in one step.”  
There are instances when outsourcing may not be necessary. A transcript or tele-  
prompter text can become the basis for captions. Services like YouTube’s auto-timing  
work fairly well for synchronizing a prepared and accurate transcript with video.  
Partnering with transcription software.  
“You can’t just take random, noisy, multi-speaker audio and expect high quality  
automatic transcription.” But, with care, it’s possible to transcribe a clean recording  
of clearly spoken audio using speech-to-text software like Dragon. “I know we want  
the tools to shape themselves to us and not us shape ourselves to the tools, but … if  
you talk a little bit more robotically and enunciate properly, you can actually get a  
decent transcript using automatic speech recognition tools.”  
Adding captioning to the web media production workflow.  
Integrating captions should be part of the post-production process of editing the  
media and digitizing for different platforms. “The people who know video and edit-  
ing tools get this.”  
profile continues on next page  
Accessible Media\: Supports All Senses 171 Profile\: Accessible Media with Larry Goldberg \(continued\)  
Looking ahead for accessible media.  
“With HTML5, you can link to different types of synchronized streams within  
the same web page.” An instructional video containing information written on a  
board could display the same information in a new window as text. Or the infor-  
mation could be inserted into the video as a text track, and viewers can pause,  
listen to the synthesized text, and resume playing, making the content accessible  
to people who are blind or visually impaired.  
Given the demonstrated value-added nature of captions and other accessibility  
features, Larry predicts that “as more captions come online as part of the new  
requirements, others not covered by the rules will too begin providing captions  
because they see the value.”

# Amusement Park Rides  
The Sensory Village at Morgan’s Wonderland features a cluster of  
shops, each one offering activities to stimulate the senses. In the  
Auto Fix-It Shop, touch screens enable “designers” of all ages to cre-  
ate vehicles of their dreams and email the graphic representations to  
their home computers. \(www.morganswonderland.com\)  
Theme park rides have come a long way from the physical thrills of roller  
coasters and Ferris wheels. The big theme parks have modern rides that  
combine a story with an environment to create an immersive experience  
appealing to all senses with motion, 3D movies, sound, touch, texture, and  
even smell. But there are also parks that let visitors create their own experi-  
ence. Morgan’s Wonderland in San Antonio, “the first-ever ultra-accessible  
family fun park,” was designed as a place where everyone, regardless of their  
abilities, can have fun. Their attractions encourage imaginative play in a  
physically safe environment. As technology and the web have changed from being a novelty to  
a part of daily life, expectations have also changed. More and  
more, it’s possible to assume that technology will work, at least  
most of the time. That expectation is as true for people with disabilities  
as for anyone else.  
In each of the chapters so far, we have shown how good design practice  
and accessibility go hand in hand. The same is true for usability. Once  
technical barriers are dealt with, you can focus on designing for usable  
accessibility, providing a good experience for everyone, and creating  
products that are not only usable, but even delightful to use.  
# How Universal Usability  
# Supports Web Accessibility  
Every time users have to struggle with operating a control, go into  
problem-solving mode to figure out where a link has taken them, or  
wonder what an image says, the website has taken them away from their  
own goal and broken the flow of the activity. Experiences such as these  
make products less usable and less enjoyable. They also make users feel  
less satisfied and successful.  
With universal usability, people can focus on the experience and their  
own goals because the product anticipates their needs.  
• People can focus on their own activity or task. When the tech-  
nical barriers to accessibility are removed, it’s possible to become  
immersed in the activity, rather than focusing on the mechanics of  
the interaction. The state of concentrated immersion is sometimes  
called flow. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of the book Flow\: The  
Psychology of Optimal Experience, defines flow as a single-minded  
immersion in an activity or context. People experience flow when  
they are engaged in meeting a clear personal goal and have con-  
trol over the activity. Direct and immediate feedback and intrinsic  
rewards of the challenge help them lose self-consciousness and  
become absorbed into the activity. Programmers, designers, and  
gamers talk about being “in the zone,” when they are able to be highly  
productive and focused on their task. Flow happens when there is no  
friction between what you want to do and the software or website you  
are using to do it.  
• The site anticipates people’s needs for information or interac-  
tion. Instead of just plopping everything on the screen and letting  
users sort it out for themselves, delightful products are organized to  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 175 provide what people need, when they need it, without overwhelming  
them with too much. A product that is helpful, informative, and use-  
ful can only be designed with a strong understanding of the audience.  
“Seeing color.”  
You might wonder why a blind person  
needs to know about colors. I can put  
labels in my clothes so I don’t end up with  
clashing colors, but sometimes I need  
to know what color something is, like  
Jacob  
when someone tells me to get the “red  
folder.” One of the coolest apps I’ve found  
recently lets me point my phone’s camera at anything and then  
it reads the color name back to me. Is that a red pepper or a  
green pepper? It’s a whole new kind of independence.  
That’s a practical use, but I learned about this app from an  
article that had this poetic description of walking around a  
garden hearing all the different colors described. He called it  
mind-blowing. I agree.  
# How to Design for Universal Usability  
The guidelines in earlier chapters supported universal usability by mak-  
ing sure that elements in the design of websites and apps didn’t create  
barriers, and that content and functionality were provided in a way that  
was accessible to different modes of use. Like lean design or “mobile  
first,” universal usability requires an understanding of users and their  
goals to create sites that seem simple and transparently easy, even if the  
activity is complex.  
Designing for universal usability builds on this foundation, pulling  
together the principles in this book to go beyond technical accessibil-  
ity and basic requirements to create a good experience for everyone.  
The most innovative products not only lower the “costs” by removing  
frustrations, but also help people reach a sense of delight in a seamless  
interaction, raising the “benefits.” The emotions produced in the rela-  
tionship between cost and benefit are shown in Figure 10.1.

Sometimes the fun is in finding your own way through a site, whether it’s  
a site for information, play, or staying connected. The goal of designing  
for exploration and discovery is to encourage users to try something new  
or follow a tangent, feeling safe in doing so.  
Design for direct manipulation  
When Ben Shneiderman first coined the term direct manipulation, most  
software was controlled through commands, often typed into a text  
interface. He suggested that designs that made actions rapid, incre-  
mental, and reversible would reduce errors and encourage exploration.  
Many mobile apps \(and web apps influenced by mobile design\) now  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 177 incorporate direct interaction with objects on the screen, showing the  
results of actions immediately.  
A good example of successful direct manipulation is the spreading and  
pinching gestures used to zoom in and out on a mobile device or tablet.  
Contrast how immediate the feedback is compared with changing the  
size of the image by entering a percentage or even by dragging a separate  
slider control.  
In early direct manipulation interfaces, feedback was often presented only  
visually. It’s important to include a way for the results of an action to be  
presented nonvisually as well, with a description or tactile feedback.  
Apple’s iPhone is an excellent example of a direct manipulation interface  
that is accessible, whether or not you can see the controls. The VoiceOver  
screen reader announces and describes elements in the interface and  
provides feedback about interactions with the interface \(Figure 10.2\).  
FIGURE 10. 2  
VoiceOver uses both  
voice and gestures  
to interact with the  
iPhone. \(www.apple.  
com/accessibility/  
iphone/vision.html\)  
Disclose the right things at the right time  
Instead of dumping everything onto the screen at once, think about how  
much information or how many different features are needed at any  
point in an interaction. This technique, called “progressive disclosure,”  
is commonly used in software interaction to manage complexity. For  
example, application menus typically contain the most commonly used  
features, with secondary features accessible via submenus.  
Using progressive disclosure, or layering information, you can reveal  
the right amount of information at the right time, with the most impor-  
tant information first. There are many different ways to design for  
progressive disclosure.  
178 Chapter 10 • Show the most basic \(or critical\) information with a way to see more,  
for example, by using an accordion or a show/hide control. This can  
help make information easier to scan by making hidden content  
available with an easy \(and easily reversible\) action.  
• Reveal additional features only when needed, such as when a control-  
ling field is filled in, a condition is met, or when a user requests them.  
What’s important for accessibility is that the disclosed content comes  
after the trigger that discloses it so that assistive technology will find  
it in the proper place in the reading sequence \(see Figure 10.3\). ARIA  
should also be used to communicate content changes that occur as the  
result of using interactive elements. \(See Chapter 5, “Easy Interaction,”  
Use WAI-ARIA for complex elements.\)  
FIGURE 10.3  
On the National Cancer  
Institute search page,  
the secondary selec-  
tion is only revealed  
after first choosing the  
type of cancer.  
Games Are a Window to the World  
The AbleGamers Foundation \(www.ablegamers.com\) estimates that  
33 million people with disabilities use online games. They see games  
as more than a way to fill time or an amusement.  
Games may be a way to make friends or socialize when other commu-  
nication or face-to-face meeting is difficult. As they put it, “For many  
people with disabilities, games offer a window to the world.”  
The group works to support gamers with disabilities and to help game  
developers create games that are more inclusive. Their companion  
website, Includification \(www.includification.com\), spells out guide-  
lines for games accessibility by type of disability, with examples. A  
booklet puts the guidelines in a single 48-page resource for console  
and personal computer games.  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 179 Give rewards  
Gamification is an interaction technique that aims to make common  
tasks more interesting by encouraging emotional engagement with the  
interface. One of the most basic techniques is the reward\: points or badges  
that acknowledge steps in an activity or achievements toward a goal.  
Think of rewards as a souped-up progress bar that adds status informa-  
tion and encouragement to the basic information associated with a task.  
You can also reward exploration by acknowledging discoveries, such as  
acknowledging a user for trying a new feature or finding new information.  
Games and social applications also provide good signposting through  
status indicators. Levels \(like the ones shown in Figure 10.4\) are a cue  
not only for progress but also for the difficulty of a task \(like ratings for  
ski slopes\). Reputation points \(and associated levels\) act as a quick indi-  
cator for the rank of another user. Status indicators can help users stay  
oriented, especially when consistent indicators are presented in words  
and audio as well as visually.  
FIGURE 10.4  
In the Apple support forums, members gain  
points by answering questions and by how  
other members rate their answers. The lev-  
els are shown in both icons \(with color and  
shape\) and text.  
Support beginners and experts  
In addition to thinking about how to make the web accessible to an audi-  
ence with different abilities and using diverse technologies, for universal  
usability, Ben Shneiderman says we must also “bridge the gap between  
what users know and what they need to know.” In some ways, this facet  
is the most difficult, as it requires an adaptable approach not only in  
design and technology but also in content and functionality. However, as  
Ben points out, the benefits are enormous. \(See Toward Universal Usabil-  
ity with Ben Shneiderman in the profile in this chapter.\)  
In Chapter 8, “Plain Language,” Provide plain language summaries of  
complex content, we described how the National Cancer Institute pro-  
vides different types of health information, creating a bridge between  
patients and family and professionals. And it’s a two-way bridge\: in some  
cases professionals are novices, and vice versa—patients and family  
180 Chapter 10 through necessity can sometimes become as knowledgeable as profes-  
sionals about certain conditions.  
In interface design, bridging the gap comes in many forms. One is with  
the help information, where instructions appear in the basic interface  
and are available only on request. Novice users may make extensive use  
of a supporting help feature until they grow proficient with the site. And  
since the more comprehensive help is easily available, it does not get in  
the way of expert users.  
Another approach is to provide different methods for accomplishing the  
same task. Amazon’s “1-Click” shopping supports frequent buyers who  
are confident in their selection, account setup, and in the services Ama-  
zon provides. New or infrequent Amazon shoppers will likely want to go  
the more traditional “shopping cart” route, which offers more opportuni-  
ties to review and confirm purchasing details.  
Create a conversation  
Too often, sites talk at users. They push information at them based on  
an assumption about what they came to learn or do. The rise of social  
media and user-generated content can be a wake-up call to change that  
approach. When users contribute to a site, the conversational nature of  
good user experience becomes easy to see. But even sites without com-  
ments or other social features should have elements that engage users in  
conversation.  
Layer information  
As a metaphor for layering information, Leslie O’Flahavan and Mari-  
lynne Rudick from E-Write \(www.ewriteonline.com\) talk about creating  
bites, snacks, and meals, and serving up just the right amount at a time.  
In their definition\:  
• A bite is a headline with a message.  
• A snack is a concise summary.  
• A meal is the complete information.  
News and shopping sites layer information naturally, allowing users to  
decide how much detail they want by presenting an article or product  
description as a heading and teaser paragraph, linked to the full detail page.  
Twitter is an application built around the concept of layering. Think  
about a super-short tweet, with a link to a short blog entry, with a link to  
a longer article. The tweet is the bite, the blog entry is the snack, and the  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 181 full article is the meal, and users get to choose, each step of the way, how  
much information they want to consume.  
These layers can all be on one page, but more typically they are on sepa-  
rate pages connected by links. You can also use progressive disclosure to  
reveal hidden information as needed.  
A layered approach to accessing information is particularly helpful for  
users who have a limited view of a web page, such as when using screen  
magnification software, which shows only a small portion of the screen  
at one time, or reading on the smaller screens of a mobile device. With  
good use of layering, users get enough information to make an informed  
decision about whether to take the next step toward learning more.  
Tell a story  
Stories persuade instead of commanding action. Telling a story can  
explain not just what a site does but also why it will be a valuable experi-  
ence. Stories help users try new things or change their behavior because  
they allow them to imagine themselves in new situations. In effect, the  
story creates a conversation, asking users who they want to be, and then  
suggesting ways to reach that goal. A story can also offer motivation,  
either real or imaginary \(like the zombies in Figure 10.5\).  
FIGURE 10.5  
Most running apps track your stats, but  
Zombies, Run! mixes physical training with  
stories of “gripping missions” that involve  
outrunning a pack of zombies, as a way of  
motivating you to get out and run—fast!  
\(www.zombiesrungame.com\)  
182 Chapter 10 Be informative and helpful  
Labels, prompts, instructions, and feedback in the interface serve the  
important role of helpful assistant—not one who bosses users around, or  
bores them with too much information, but one who seems to always be  
able to anticipate what’s needed, and provides just the right guidance at  
the right time.  
Provide an overview  
Let users see the scope of a task or activity.  
• Show all of the steps, so the scope is clear.  
• Show relationships, such as the order in which steps must be  
completed.  
• Show progress through the steps.  
Keeping users oriented is especially important if a task is spread across  
more than one page, crosses devices, or has to be completed over time,  
such as setting up a bank account, shown in Figure 10.6.  
Give instructions at the right time, in the right place  
A big block of instructions at the top of the page is easily forgotten as a  
user works through a form or other interaction. Prompts or labels that  
display after a form field can come too late, after the field has been com-  
pleted. Confirmation and error messages that display out of context are  
easily overlooked. Good help is not something users have to look for. It’s  
there, where and when it’s needed.  
• Put preparation instructions or an overview at the beginning of  
the process.  
• Put more detailed instructions just before they are needed.  
• Offer extra help or tips for completion via a link to a help feature.  
Make sure the link displays before the action it supports, and that the  
feature is built to be accessible.  
• Put interactive feedback, such as confirmation that an entry is for-  
matted correctly or an alert that the information was not entered  
correctly, after the element in the linear sequence. \(See Chapter 5,  
Provide accessible instructions and feedback.\)  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 183 Your account name and  
number are shown as  
they will appear on the  
debit card.  
After each step, a check  
mark appears to confirm  
that you completed it  
correctly.

you what to do but also  
why you are doing it.  
You can see the whole  
page, but sections of the

when you are ready to

184 Chapter 10 Tell me what I need in advance.  
When I go online, I just want to do things  
like everyone else. Most of the time, my  
disability doesn’t slow me down, but  
when you mix having to get around in the  
real world with online forms, it can be a  
Emily  
perfect storm of annoying barriers. Today,  
I’m trying to sign up for a seminar at  
my college. Why can’t they tell me all the documents I’ll need  
before I start this process? I got the form filled out, but when  
I went into the office this morning, I discovered that I needed  
to bring other documents with me. The online form didn’t say  
anything about it. The whole trip was a big waste.  
Practice usability for accessibility  
Good design and accessibility guidelines are a good place to start, but to  
create something that delights your users, you have to get out and meet  
them. For universal usability, user research and usability testing are  
key activities at the beginning of the project and through all phases of  
design and development, not just at the end.  
Do usability testing  
If you aren’t already testing your work, this is a good time to start. The  
days when usability only happened in expensive labs with an academic-  
style methodology are gone. In their place, we have rapid evaluation  
cycles that fit into an agile development process, testing with a small  
number of people at a time, using all sorts of remote and self-moderated  
testing tools.  
Usability testing includes moderated sessions, in which you work  
directly with users\:  
• In their own environment \(also called field studies\)  
• In a lab or conference room  
• Over the web, using screen sharing and a voice connection  
Usability testing also includes a wide range of self-moderated testing,  
in which you ask users to complete a set of activities using a tool that  
records what they do and their feedback. There are also tools that blend  
analytics with records of user activities, providing a view of how users  
navigate through your site.  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 185 Raising the Floor\: A Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure  
One of the challenges for universal usability is the difficulty in matching acces-  
sibility guidelines to “common” assistive technology. Gregg Vanderheiden, the  
accessibility and universal design pioneer whose innovations are built into the  
Windows and Mac OS accessibility features, realized that standards are caught  
between two untenable options. Standards can either create guidelines that\:  
• Result in web pages that could be accessed using only the latest versions of the  
best \(and most expensive\) assistive technologies.  
• Work with most AT but would severely limit web content to just basic web  
technologies.  
Raising the Floor \(raisingthefloor.org\) is dedicated to solving this problem. It’s  
an international collaboration of developers, advocates, researchers, and web  
designers with a mission\: To make web and mobile technologies accessible to  
everyone with disability, literacy, and age-related barriers, regardless of their  
economic status.  
The goal of the project is to create a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure  
\(gpii.net and gpii.net/Cloud4All\) that can make access technology available  
on any website or connected device, raising the base level of accessibility  
for everyone, no matter where they are. They call it anytime, anywhere, any  
computer access, using automatic personalization of the user interface, based  
on user preferences stored in the cloud.  
Each information and communication technology \(ICT\) device will be able to  
instantly change to fit users as they encounter the device, rather than requiring  
users to figure out how to adapt, configure, or install access features they need.  
Usability testing reveals opportunities to improve the user experience.  
Take what you learn from observing behaviors and collecting feedback  
to refine your approach and improve your designs. Then you can cor-  
rect issues that trip up your users and streamline tasks so that users are  
more successful with your product and have more fun using it.  
Include people with disabilities in usability work  
It’s hard to create a good experience relying only on compliance with  
principles, standards, and regulations. That’s especially true for univer-  
sal usability. The accessibility standards, like WCAG 2.0, are written not  
only to solve a problem, but also to make it easy to test a site and know  
if it meets the standard. They get you part of the way, but not all the way  
to universal usability. If you don’t include usability testing with people  
186 Chapter 10 who use assistive technologies, you will never know whether you have  
created a site that goes beyond accessibility to create delight for people  
with disabilities.  
For more about the importance of usability for accessibility, see Chap-  
ter 2, “People First,” “Know Your Audience.” For information about and  
resources for integrating usability testing into the design process, see  
Chapter 11, “In Practice.” In particular, check out the usability informa-  
tion and tools listed in Appendix C, “More Reading.”  
# Who Is Responsible for  
# Universal Usability?  
The entire team plays a key role in building in the features that make for  
a delightful user experience. Strategies and techniques for good inter-  
face design and universal usability must be part of the designs.  
User research and usability are key activities for universal usability.  
User research is typically part of defining the purpose and design at the  
start of a project. Ideally, usability testing is integrated into each step  
of the process, allowing the team to prototype, test, and refine concepts  
before moving to the next phase in the design and development process.  
Usability testing is also part of the QA phase, to ensure that the finished  
product can be used successfully.  
# Summary  
Although it’s important to meet basic guidelines for accessibility,  
our goal is much more inclusive\: to create a good user experience for  
everyone, including people with disabilities.  
Universal usability helps technology “disappear” so that people can  
focus on their own activities. It relies on user research and usabil-  
ity testing to create designs that can anticipate users, acting as an  
assistant rather than directing the interaction.  
Designing for universal usability allows people to explore safely  
and interact in a direct way. It layers information and activities so  
that users are not overwhelmed, and it acknowledges their achieve-  
ments, and lets them control the flow of the activity, as well as the  
interface itself.  
Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 187 Profile\: T oward Universal Usability with Ben Shneiderman  
For over 30 years, Human-Computer Interaction \(HCI\) pioneer Ben  
Shneiderman has worked to keep the “ human” in HCI broadly defined.  
Through research and teaching, writing and speaking, convening and  
facilitating, he has advocated for and assisted in the creation of tech-  
nology tools in support of the common good. His award-winning book,  
Leonardo’s Laptop\: Human Needs and the New Computing Technolo-  
gies, is a call to action, urging users to expect success from their technology tools, and  
challenging designers and developers to satisfy those expectations.  
Since Ben invented the concept of universal usability, we wanted to get his take on  
how designers are measuring up, and what is keeping them from moving forward  
more effectively.  
We are making progress toward universal usability.  
In his May 2000 Communications of the ACM article, Ben raised the bar from acces-  
sibility to “universal usability,” going beyond technical accessibility for people with  
disabilities to successful use of computers by everyone.1 Now, more than a decade  
later, Ben is optimistic, citing examples including mobile apps, mobile phones, and  
digital cameras where “most people can succeed most of the time.”  
To illustrate, Ben tells a story of a recent plane trip. He was seated next to a busi-  
nesswoman who was blind, which he knew because of the cane he helped tuck away  
in the overhead bin. “She sat down next to me, took out her iPad and keyboard,  
plugged in her earphones, and began to work.” During the flight, Ben had the oppor-  
tunity to chat with her. “I asked whether she was using special software and she said  
no.” The current implementation on the Apple iPad provided everything she needed  
to do her work. “That’s the kind of progress that inspires me in a wonderful way. It  
is gratifying to know that thoughtful design enables users with disabilities to hold  
challenging jobs and lead more fulfilling lives.”  
Universal usability is about satisfying experiences.  
“‘Accessibility’ defines a set of technical requirements that could be met and yet  
the result may not be universally usable. ‘Universal usability’ specifies not just the  
attributes of the technology but the experience of the users.” Universal usability is  
measured by way of real users, which, Ben acknowledges, “is a serious challenge.”  
“The expectation of satisfying the full range of human diversity is an enormously  
high achievement to push toward.” But he also believes it is achievable, if everyone  
1 http\://www.cs.umd.edu/\~ben/p84-shneiderman-May2000CACMf.pdf  
188 Chapter 10 makes it a priority. “Health is achievable. We have times when our health is better  
than others, but we strive to be healthy all the time.” Similarly, we should strive to  
satisfy people “with different hardware, different network connections, different  
abilities, and different levels of knowledge about using computer technology.”  
Expecting to be successful in our use of technology.  
Much has to do with our expectations as consumers of technology—whether we  
expect to be satisfied, or to satisfice.  
Take, for example, digital cameras. We started out with small digital cameras that  
were able to take fuzzy images, and “we now expect to be able to take good photos  
indoors without a flash on a cell phone.”  
But, in many cases, our expectations have not been forceful enough to affect change.  
Software still produces “frustration and difficulty.” University and commercial  
websites are not accessible. Even government agency websites that are under strict  
legal requirements to be accessible often aren’t. To make real gains, every user must  
become an activist, speaking up to influence those who can make change happen.  
Strategies for delivering universally usable experiences.  
One approach to designing universally usable software is using multi-layer inter-  
faces. Ben calls these “karate interfaces,” in that users move metaphorically from  
white belt to black, mastering different skills at each step to build proficiency. “More  
attention to multi-layer interfaces could make systems usable by people with low  
skills and low needs, as well as people with high ability and high needs.”  
Ben recognizes that this type of interface requires more effort to build, but asserts,  
“It’s something we should all expect. Moderate effort by the design team can bring  
huge benefits for millions of users.”  
We expect automobiles to have levels of adjustability. We can move the seat,  
tilt the steering wheel, angle the mirrors, raise the lighting. Of course, it takes  
more time to design and may cost more, but the benefits to usability and safety  
are enormous.  
Mature technologies have many forms of adjustability that are easy to use,  
enabling people to move gracefully from simple use to more elaborate use. They  
empower people to do remarkable things.

Universal Usability\: Creates Delight 189 Profile\: T oward Universal Usability with Ben Shneiderman \(continued\)  
Building awareness and expertise in the profession.  
The main force holding accessibility back is lack of knowledge in the profession.  
Ben suggests a universal usability review for textbooks. “That kind of review  
would make authors, adopters, professors, and university departments aware  
that universal usability is an essential part of computer science.” Ideally, the  
topic would be integrated into every aspect of the book, as with Ben’s seminal  
textbook, Designing the User Interface\: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer  
Interaction, with Catherine Plaisant, Maxine Cohen, and Steven Jacobs. In  
the current 5th edition, Ben notes that “There is no chapter about universal  
usability—the whole book is about universal usability!”  
There is a growing movement in support of software engineer certification.  
I’m in favor of that, and I think one of the criteria should be that their train-  
ing covers accessibility and universal usability. Universal usability shouldn’t  
be a special course that someone has to take. It should be part of the prepa-  
ration for anyone who learns about computer science and training for every  
computing professional. I want to be in a discipline and part of a profession  
that is proud of its role in achieving universal usability.

206 Clayton Lewis and John Reiman1 famously said, “It just won’t work  
to build a complete system and then, in the final stages of devel-  
opment, spread the interface over it like peanut butter.” In the  
two decades since they wrote this, it’s become obvious that this applies  
to content strategy, information architecture, interaction design, con-  
tent, usability … and accessibility. To avoid the peanut butter approach  
to accessibility, accessibility must be integral to the practice of every  
member of the product team.  
You may be a team of one, or part of a large enterprise team, with many  
stakeholders and users. But most projects are a team effort. Websites  
don’t get built by the shoemaker’s elves, but by people—typically, teams  
of people who bring together needed skills and expertise.  
A heading is a good example. A lot of work goes into making it possible  
to do something as simple as putting an \<h2\> tag around a little piece of  
text. The people writing the content and producing the web pages are  
responsible for the headings, but they are the tip of the iceberg. For that  
heading to appear on a page, a lot of different people work together\:  
• The UX researchers identified user needs and vocabulary.  
• An information architect created a taxonomy of keywords.  
• A content strategist wrote it.  
• A web producer tagged it as a heading.  
• A graphic artist decided on its appearance.  
• A web specialist created the style.  
• A developer connected the stylesheet to the page.  
• A systems engineer set up the server.  
So far, we have focused on the different facets of how to design with  
accessibility built in, and who on the team is responsible. In this chapter,  
we’ll bring it all together to talk about how accessible design happens,  
on a team of one or many, and within the larger organization. We’ll also  
take a look at practices and tools that help make an integrated approach  
to accessibility possible.  
With a practice that supports a web for everyone, people and organiza-  
tions consider accessibility integral to their work and products.

John Rieman \(1993\). http\://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-0.html  
192 Chapter 11 Making Accessibility the  
# Way You Do Business  
The initial motivation to pay attention to accessibility can come from  
many different directions.  
• In some organizations, accessibility may start in the procurement  
department, with purchasing requirements.  
• On the other side of the purchasing equation, information technology  
product manufacturers may focus on the competitive advantage in  
ensuring that their products meet accessibility laws or any relevant  
certifications.  
• Marketing departments will want to promote accessibility among  
the product features, or meet the needs of a large and growing  
demographic.  
• Legal requirements in national laws and regulations are one starting  
point. In many countries, for example, any information technology  
purchased by government organizations must be accessible.  
• Or it might be a fear of being sued over an inaccessible site that moti-  
vates attention to accessibility. There have been some high-profile  
lawsuits focused on equal access to ecommerce functions, such as  
shopping, finance, and travel. In companies concerned with law-  
suits, legal or risk management departments may initiate work on  
accessibility.  
When accessibility efforts focus on compliance with guidelines or regu-  
lations, it’s seen more as a matter of completing a checklist. The team  
assigned to evaluate accessibility is typically outside of the product  
team, and can be seen as the “accessibility cops.”  
Even when accessibility is managed from within the product team, it  
may be relegated to QA or an audit by a specialized group after the code  
is done. These approaches treat accessibility as a real concern only after  
the fact.  
Wherever accessibility starts in a company, the simple truth is, if you  
want to create accessible websites and web apps, concern for accessibil-  
ity has to be integrated into all the other activities that go into creating a  
great user experience. Accessibility must be the practice of every person  
who makes decisions in the design process. It must be simply how you

Toby Biddle runs a company that makes a remote usability testing service called  
Loop 11. Before his company came along, most of the online testing tools weren’t  
very usable, and certainly weren’t accessible, so it was a surprise to find out just  
how accessible Loop 11 is.  
When we asked Toby how it happened, he said that one developer on the team  
made it a personal mission—just wouldn’t let go—and pushed everyone else  
to get on board. That developer’s impact went beyond one product, because  
Loop 11 makes it possible to include people using assistive technology in remote  
usability testing.  
Having an accessible site also led to a new opportunity. Loop 11 teamed up  
with Knowbility, a non-profit advocacy organization, to build a panel of people  
with disabilities who could be participants in usability tests using this service.

# Making a Commitment to Accessibility  
In an integrated practice, accessibility is part of all design and develop-  
ment work, and everyone on the team is accountable for making sure  
that the product works for everyone.  
When accessibility is integrated into UX practice\:  
• Accessibility is a commitment. The whole company, from the head  
office to product teams, sees making a web for everyone as a priority.  
An organizational commitment ensures that accessibility isn’t done  
only when it is convenient. Instead, management creates a culture of  
accessibility from top to bottom.  
• Accessibility is a team effort. Everyone shares responsibility,  
authority, and accountability for accessibility. The team may include  
people with special knowledge of assistive technology and how to  
design or code for it, but they are part of the team, rather than an  
external group.  
• Checks for accessibility are part of the process. Not only is the site  
designed to be inclusive, but evaluation against accessibility stan-  
dards is also part of regular QA.  
• Usability testing is inclusive. People with disabilities are included  
in user research and usability evaluation.  
194 Chapter 11 Accessibility Statements  
Down in the footer of many sites, you will find a link to an accessibility state-  
ment, an important tool for communicating your commitment to a web for  
everyone. Nomensa, an accessibility consultancy in the UK, describes the role of  
an accessibility statement this way\:  
Accessibility statements and help pages are often muddled into the same  
document. For simplicity and ease of use, it’s best to keep these two pages  
separate. People looking for help may not always consider that an accessibil-  
ity statement is the logical place to look.  
An accessibility statement should include the following components\:  
• An open commitment to providing an accessible website  
• An outline of key guidelines and standards the website follows  
• Any known exceptions to the intended level of web accessibility  
• Contact information for reporting difficulties with the website  
For more information about accessibility statements\:

blog/2009/writing-an-accessibility-statement/  
• How to write an effective accessibility statement—Hassell Inclusion\:

• Lainey Feingold maintains a list of links to accessibility statements for  
inspiration\: lflegal.com/2013/02/access-info-pages/  
• There are no “accessibility cops.” In an integrated practice, there  
is no need to be a naysayer, who says, “No, we can’t do that because  
of accessibility.” Starting early, with time to consider the goal of the  
design and find solutions that work well within the structure, means  
rarely having to say “no.”  
# Assessing What’s Needed for  
# an Integrated Practice  
Creating an integrated practice is a process, not a single event. Even if  
you are building a new team, you have to start from the current situ-  
ation. This section is organized as a checklist of questions to help you  
assess your current practice. That includes the current site, as well as the  
skills and resources on the team.  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 195 Break the problem into steps, and each one takes you closer to your goal  
of an accessible site supported by an integrated practice.  
Evaluate the current site  
Start with an overview of the site. Look for answers to questions that indi-  
cate how big a transformation will be required to make the site accessible.  
• Is it coded to standards? A site that follows coding standards and best  
practices is easier to make accessible. The development team is likely  
to have processes in place to check for standards compliance, and indi-  
vidual developers are likely to be aware of the value of robust code.  
• Do pages have title, headings, and other semantic markup?  
Good coding of the content is an important way to communicate  
information structure to assistive technology. If pages are coded  
using semantic markup, visual presentation is likely to be coded in  
a stylesheet, and authors are already accustomed to using semantic  
structure to mark up content.  
• What interactivity does the site include? In general, complex  
interactions are more difficult to make universally usable. Taking  
an inventory of how many different types of forms, interactive fea-  
tures, and other dynamic elements will give you an idea of how much  
work these parts of the site will need. You might find that some of the  
changes are relatively simple, while others may require some rethink-  
ing of the design.  
• What multimedia is on the site? If the site has video, audio, or ani-  
mated media, the first question is whether they have captions and  
transcripts. You need to know who creates the multimedia and how  
it is produced, so they can be included in plans for an integrated pro-  
cess that includes accessible media.  
• What development platforms does the site use? Does the site use  
templates or a content management system? Tools can make it  
easy—or hard—to create an accessible site. The content management  
system is particularly important because it has such a big impact on  
the long-term maintenance of the site. Accessible templates in a CMS  
that supports accessible content development will go far in support-  
ing an accessible practice.  
196 Chapter 11 Identify ways to allocate resources  
Look at the organization that creates and supports the site. Learn how  
many people and which organizational structures need to be accounted  
for in developing an integrated practice.  
• Counting everyone, how large is the product team? Small teams  
mean overlapping roles for everyone. Larger teams may have more  
specialization. The sheer number of people is a consideration, for  
everything from training to how you will manage team meetings.  
• How many different departments do the individuals belong to?  
The organizational structure affects the amount of internal advocacy  
and coordination needed, and the number of managers who need to  
be consulted on plans.  
• Who are the senior managers? Are they on board? Support from top  
management is critical. For some companies, a focus on accessibility is  
a big change, and won’t happen unless there’s a top-level mandate.  
• Who has the final responsibility and authority for the site? Learn  
who makes the final decision in a conflict over priorities—in other  
words, who can stop a product from launching if it doesn’t meet  
accessibility goals.  
Identify opportunities to integrate  
accessibility into current processes  
Consider how work is currently structured. In the short term, how will  
you organize the work of bringing the current sites up to accessibility  
standards? In the long term, how will accessibility be integrated into  
new and ongoing projects?  
• What is the development methodology? Agile? Lean? Waterfall?  
Whatever approach the development team takes, it’s helpful to be  
able to fit UX and accessibility into it seamlessly.  
• What is the release and maintenance schedule? If there is a regu-  
lar schedule, think about what changes for accessibility can be part of  
each release.  
• How are changes and bugs tracked? Some teams live and die by  
their change-tracking system. If so, it’s a good opportunity to add  
accessibility issues to the bug list. If not, come up with an approach  
for tracking and managing change requests for accessibility issues.  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 197 Assess current knowledge and readiness  
Finally, think about how deep the current commitment to accessibility  
is. How much training and advocacy work—and how much time—will be  
needed to transform the organization?  
• What are current attitudes about accessibility? Maybe you are  
starting from basic advocacy, or perhaps the team is already excited  
about making a site that’s accessible. Either way, you have to start  
from “where you are” and figure out how to get where you need to be.  
• How much knowledge is there about people with disabilities?  
Where is that knowledge held in the organization? The Human  
Resources department may already have staff or resources for helping  
people with disabilities within your company. Maybe there are other  
advocates in the company, or people who have personal experiences  
they can bring to the team. Start with internal resources and then  
decide if the team needs some user research on how people with dis-  
abilities use your products or training on commonly used assistive  
technologies.  
• Does the team have the technical skills needed? Any skills gap  
must be filled with training, whether it’s self-study, online courses,  
workshops, or bringing in new staff. Decide what will work best for  
your team, matching expectations for any other technical training.  
# Supporting an Integrated Practice  
The checklists from the previous sections guided you through a process of\:  
• Evaluating the current site  
• Identifying ways to allocate resources  
• Identifying opportunities to integrate accessibility into current  
processes  
• Assessing current knowledge and readiness  
The next step is to create a plan detailing roles, responsibilities, and  
activities to support an integrated practice.  
Note that the plan will evolve over time, and you need to maintain “clear  
purpose” in the work of planning and creating an integrated practice,  
just as you do in creating accessible products. The practice of accessibil-  
ity requires ongoing support, including policies, training, and tools.  
198 Chapter 11 Web Accessibility Code of Practice\: BS 8878  
The British Standards Institute launched a web accessibility code of practice in  
2010 known as BS 8878. The code of practice is designed for web managers and is  
a comprehensive approach to developing and maintaining accessibility through-  
out the product lifecycle.  
Meeting this standard is a statement that a process that takes accessibility into  
account has been followed, unlike technical standards like WCAG 2.0.  
It helps managers meet the needs of people with disabilities by providing\:  
• Guidance on what makes a web product accessible, to whom, and what that  
process should include  
• Requirements for designing, procuring, building, testing, and maintaining an  
accessible web product  
You can read an overview at the Access 8878 site \(www.access8878.co.uk\). BS  
8878 is based on an earlier publication, A Guide to Good Practice in Commission-  
ing Accessible Websites, which is archived and made available for free by the UK  
Equality and Human Rights Commission \(www.equalityhumanrights.com\).  
Set policies and develop training  
The commitment to integrating accessibility into practice should be  
documented in company policy so that everyone in the organization  
understands the goals and recognizes the commitment.  
Training is equally important. It starts with a need for everyone in the  
company to have awareness and an understanding of how people with  
disabilities use the web. The web team needs core knowledge about how  
to create an accessible website. And people on the team need training on  
the tools and specific skills they need.  
Choose content and development  
tools that support accessibility  
The choice of a development environment or content management sys-  
tem can make the difference between a site where the team struggles to  
make the site accessible and one where this work seems to come natu-  
rally. Ideally, these tools are themselves accessible, allowing people with  
disabilities to be part of the content team.  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 199 Look for design and content management tools that\:  
• Provide good support for stylesheets and templates. The tools  
need to make it easy to select templates, choose styles, and update  
pages when styles and templates change. The authoring tools should  
make it easy to check the page in different modes, for example, with  
different text sizes or contrast, or looking at the page elements in lin-  
ear order or in an outline view.  
• Make it easy to add \(and manage\) text equivalents. The content  
management system should have a good interface for adding alt text  
and captions to graphics, and make this text easy to review when the  
page is saved or edited. Tools for creating captions and text descrip-  
tions for audiovisual content are likely to be separate from the main  
content management system.  
• Write accessible code. Some web design and layout tools provide  
a WYSIWYG interface that supports a visual approach to designing  
web layouts and content. In the background, the interface creates the  
HTML and CSS markup that renders the layout in the browser. Other  
designers prefer to work directly with HTML and CSS code. In either  
case, choose a tool that supports good coding practices that support  
accessibility. Consider using tools that have validation built in to help  
you check the code against technology and accessibility standards.  
• Support good markup. Consider using a content management  
system configured to allow access only to semantic markup con-  
trols. This type of system will help maintain a clean presentation by  
not allowing undefined presentation styles, and it will stop content  
authors from using presentation-style markup, like color and bold or  
italic, to visually differentiate content elements.  
Content management tools can work against accessibility. For example,  
many tools prompt users to enter a title attribute or open a link in a new  
window when best practices recommend avoiding unnecessary title  
attributes and links that open in a new window \(see Figure 11.1\). \(See the  
discussion of title attributes in Chapter 8, “Plain Language” and forcing  
new windows in Chapter 5, “Easy Interaction.”\)  
200 Chapter 11 FIGURE 11.1  
This dialog to insert a link encourages the over-use of title attributes.  
Create a style guide and media library  
Whether the site content is created and maintained by a small group of  
authors or by people across the organization, a style guide can be a helpful  
way to ensure consistency by documenting decisions and examples of how  
design, content, and code elements are used. It can include many types of  
information, such as the following guidance to help content authors\:  
• Describe how to use styles in an appropriate and consistent way so  
that content managers maintain a consistent site style over time.  
• Document decisions about the use of presentation elements such as  
tables, lists, icons, and headings for authors and designers.  
• Document terminology used on the site so that language is  
consistent.  
• Provide examples of how to write headings, links, and other  
content elements.  
• Provide examples of the correct way to format text for a clean  
presentation.  
The style guide should also summarize the user research that led to  
design decisions so that it is easy to review and keep fresh.  
If your site has a lot of multimedia, consider creating a media library.  
Media assets that are stored in a central location can be reused, rather  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 201 Procurement Can Be Part of the Solution  
Most companies buy more technology than they build. Collaboration software,  
an intranet, and all the tools that you use to do your work should also be acces-  
sible to everyone in the company. It’s a lot harder to be part of a team when you  
can’t take part in online conferences or share your files in the content manage-  
ment system. Using accessible tools also helps build good habits by showing what  
is possible. And more accessible tools are often better tools. As we’ve shown,  
usability and accessibility go hand in hand in creating a good user experience.  
Unfortunately, even when there are policies or regulations in place, they are not  
always taken seriously in decisions about what technology to purchase. People in  
the purchasing department may not know how to evaluate accessibility or how to  
make it part of a procurement decision.  
Education within the company is another role for the user experience group,  
helping business units, the purchasing department, third-party partners, and  
vendors understand how to recognize and select accessible technology.  
Procurement can be a powerful agent for change. When companies or agencies  
draw the line and take requirements seriously, their decision has a viral effect.  
Companies that want to do business with them learn to make their products acces-  
sible. Apple’s leadership in accessibility is partly the result of the California state  
university system refusing to buy their products until everyone could use them.  
than re-created each time. When images are stored with appropriate  
alt text, there is no need to reinvent the wheel \(or alt text\) each time the  
image is used.  
It is also helpful to store scripts and transcripts in a central library, where  
they can be found easily when needed for new formats or types of media.  
Include people with disabilities  
We’ve talked about the importance of research and testing with people  
with disabilities in Chapter 3, “Clear Purpose,” Chapter 8, “Plain Lan-  
guage,” and Chapter 10, “Universal Usability.” Research is even more  
important when you are starting to build an integrated practice for  
accessibility, as a way of quickly building knowledge within the team  
and organization about how people with disabilities use your website.  
Ways to include people with disabilities in your process include\:  
• User research and usability testing participants  
• Personas and scenarios  
202 Chapter 11 Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology  
\(WCAG-EM\)  
In February 2013, the WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force \(Eval TF\)  
released a working draft of a standardized approach to testing websites against  
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/\). The  
methodology covers\:  
• Defining the scope of the evaluation  
• Understanding the features and functionality of the website  
• Creating a representative sample of web pages to evaluate  
• Evaluating the sample against WCAG 2.0  
• Documenting and reporting findings  
The authors start the document by emphasizing that evaluation needs to be  
integrated into the development process, and that everyone on the team needs to  
be involved\:  
Everyone involved in the \(re-\)design, \(re-\)development, and ongoing creation  
of web content needs to evaluate the accessibility of their contribution to the  
website to ensure that it is uniformly accessible.  
The subsequent sections cover in depth each step of the methodology. Unfortu-  
nately, the document does not link to sample reports, but Appendix C, Example  
Reports, currently contains details about what components should be included in  
a report. Its title gives hope that there may be sample reports in the future!  
• Advisory boards or other stakeholder groups  
• User groups or beta testers  
Provide tools and assistive technology  
for ongoing evaluation  
The product team needs both tools to help design for accessibility and  
effective ways to test the site as it is developed. A robust program for  
evaluating accessibility may include automated testing with testing  
tools, a manual review by someone with a trained eye, and usabil-  
ity testing with people with disabilities who use different types of  
assistive technology.  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 203 Toolbars  
There are free toolbars for almost every browser that inspect a web page  
for accessibility issues. They are a useful way to complete a first check,  
looking for easily defined problems in the code. However, like any auto-  
matic testing system, these tools are only as good as their programming.  
For example, they can tell you if there is alt text present, but not whether  
it’s useful, informative text.  
Most of the toolbars cover many of the items listed in the WAI Easy Checks  
\(www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary.html\) list of the first steps in check-  
ing a page. Their features include many of the same basic functions\:  
• Display the page without styles, turning off images \(to check for alt  
text and layout\), or as text only pages \(showing the linear order in  
which the content will be read by assistive technology and making  
hidden elements visible\).  
• Show a listing of the structure, for example, showing an outline of  
headings and the keyboard tab order.  
• Display errors and alerts, in alt text, forms code, and other  
requirements.  
Assistive technology  
Both the Mac OSX and Windows operating systems include features to  
support accessibility, such as display contrast options, keyboard sup-  
port, and options to make the mouse more visible.  
You also may want to learn how to use screen readers and other assis-  
tive technologies, so you can check details of how the software reads a  
page. You may never be as proficient as someone who uses these tools all  
the time, but it’s possible to learn how to step through a page and use the  
navigation features to do a technical check.  
VoiceOver is built into Mac OSX. Go to Universal Access in System Pref-  
erences to turn it on and use the tutorial to get started. Although JAWS  
from Freedom Scientific is still the most widely used screen reader for  
Windows, there are some free tools. One of them, NVDA \(Non Visual  
Desktop Access\), which is an open source screen reader, has the added  
bonus of excellent support for WAI-ARIA.  
BrowseAloud \(www.browsealoud.com\) is not a full screen reader—it  
only reads web pages and PDF files that are intended for people who  
have reading disabilities such as dyslexia, learning difficulties, or mild  
visual disabilities.  
204 Chapter 11 For more on evaluation tools and assistive technologies, see Appendix C,  
“More Reading.”  
Make accessibility part of site maintenance  
Be sure that you don’t let accessibility slip away under the weight of  
many small changes during ongoing work on content and site mainte-  
nance. To make a web for everyone part of the organizational mandates,  
the web governance plan and content strategy must include guide-  
lines for how to manage and accommodate different business and user  
requests without sacrificing clean presentation and accessibility. You  
should also have a plan to monitor new content and multimedia, mak-  
ing sure that you have resources and planning for ongoing production of  
transcripts, captions, and video descriptions.  
# Summary  
Creating a practice that can support accessibility is not easy. It  
starts with a new approach to design, as we’ve described in this  
book. It also needs a team and organization to back up the vision of  
a web for everyone. The organizational and management issues are  
important if you want changes to stick. Building a web for everyone  
takes commitment and skill over the long term.  
• Start with an evaluation of the current situation of both the site  
and your web team.  
• Map out a path from “here” to “there,” noting what tools and  
training it takes to make the journey.  
• Be sure you have support at all levels, from the team members to  
the top management.  
• Choose tools that support accessibility, making it easy to imple-  
ment the technical details in the code and content.  
• Build connections to people with disabilities, ensuring that they  
are part of your process at all stages.  
In Practice\: An Integrated Process 205 Profile\: Design Education with Valerie Fletcher  
Valerie Fletcher, executive director of the Institute for Human Cen-  
tered Design since 1998, helped shape the Principles of Universal  
Design. With many years of engagement in advancing accessibility  
and universal design in the public and private sectors, Valerie has a  
deep knowledge and clear perspective of the challenges and oppor-  
tunities that exist in moving forward the agenda of universal design  
for web accessibility.  
We wanted to learn what she considers to be the greatest challenge in integrating acces-  
sibility into the practice of web design.  
The state of accessibility and universal design.  
As one of the team that created the Principles of Universal Design, Valerie says,  
“I have both tremendous optimism and tremendous anxiety that we’re never going  
to get anywhere. Good ideas don’t thrive just because they are good ideas. But still,  
I feel more optimistic than I did five years ago.”  
Education is a catalyst for change.  
Education often drives design trends. Students identify with what they are taught  
and how they are introduced to their field. If they are taught that form is paramount,  
then more functional concerns, such as accessibility, will always be secondary.  
In architecture, Valerie notes, “The only time an architect is likely to touch accessi-  
bility in a serious way is during licensing. Most commonly in the U.S., the only time  
one is taught anything about accessibility, let alone universal design, is likely in the  
context of an introduction to code requirements that teach plumbing code, electri-  
cal code, and accessibility. Is it any wonder people think \[accessibility and universal  
design\] is about cutting into your creative brilliance?”  
Building a curriculum in universal design and accessibility.  
Today’s design curriculum does not do an adequate job of covering accessibility  
and universal design, and the information that is provided is geared toward meet-  
ing compliance standards. This approach results in a “just tell me what I have to do”  
approach to accessibility, which in turn produces inadequate designs. “Just tell me  
what I have to do has not resulted in the kind of creative energy and true innovation  
we need to make progress in this area,” says Valerie.  
For universal design to succeed, it first needs to be adopted by faculty and  
then taught to students. It needs to be intrinsic to how students learn the  
206 Chapter 11 practice—fundamental to how they brand their work and pitch themselves pro-  
fessionally. “If we miss that opportunity, then it becomes a case of the one-off  
student—the one who, against all odds, persists.”  
Universal design has to be integrated into the practice of designing buildings,  
spaces, communications, products, interiors, and software—into the design of the  
things we use, the spaces we inhabit, and the way we learn and communicate.  
Accessibility guidelines set the baseline.  
Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are in some ways equiva-  
lent to building codes in the build environment. They help in establishing “a floor  
of accessibility and, in the case of W3C/WAI, beyond that to a high standard of  
usability.” However, design and designers are too often not part of the discus-  
sion, and Valerie sees this as a major failing. “There’s still a big gap in being able to  
identify great websites that look as good as they act. A lot of designers have yet to  
be convinced that you can get great design and great usability performance in a  
single site.”  
Great examples inspire great designs.  
Bringing universal design to bear adds a whole new dimension to the discussion.  
“You need to drive the conversation by capturing people with great case studies,  
great examples, great leaders, and bringing in a global perspective. You will see bet-  
ter outcomes if you inspire and catalyze.”  
Take, for example, the NAO robot and the iPhone and iPad. NAO is a programmable  
humanoid robot that is being used for such tasks as providing assistance to people  
with significant dexterity and mobility limitations and teaching social interaction  
to children with autism. Apple’s mobile devices offer a wide array of interaction  
modes, including speech recognition and text-to-speech, so that people can interact  
with software on the device in whatever way suits their context. As Valerie notes,  
“People learned a lot about design that is user friendly from Apple.”  
Looking ahead, Valerie sees the demand for customization and personalization  
of technology products and services as a catalyst for adoption of accessibility  
and universal design concepts by designers. “If you take ‘we’re all different’ as the  
starting point, and then train designers to respond to that reality, then you hit  
the sweet spot.”

Now, to the Future 217 So far, we have focused on the process of designing. We’ve peeled  
back the layers of websites or web applications, and examined  
different principles, guidelines, and best practices that go into  
making a web for everyone. We have shown that by including a wider  
range of people and devices in your thinking, accessibility becomes an  
extension of good design, and people with diverse abilities and contexts  
can use the web successfully and enjoyably \(see Table 12.1\).  
In the future, everyone is part of making a web for everyone.

Principle What It Does Why It Is Important  
People First Designing for

People are the first consideration,  
and sites are designed with  
the needs of everyone in the  
audience in mind.  
Clear Purpose Well-defined goals People enjoy products that are  
designed for the audience and  
guided by a defined purpose  
and goals.  
Solid Structure Built to standards People feel confident using  
the design because it is stable,  
robust, and secure.  
Easy Interaction Everything works People can use the product  
across all modes of interaction  
and operating with a broad range  
of devices.  
Helpful Wayfinding Guides users People can navigate a site,  
feature, or page following self-  
explanatory signposts.  
Clean Presentation Supports meaning People can perceive and  
understand elements in the design.  
Plain Language Creates a  
conversation  
People can read, understand, and  
use the information.  
Accessible Media Supports all senses People can understand and use  
information contained in media,  
such as images, audio, video,  
animation, and presentations.  
Universal Usability Creates delight People can focus on the  
experience and their own goals  
because the product anticipates  
their needs.

to have a web that is designed and built for everyone, and identify what it  
will take to get there.  
Web accessibility is all of our responsibility. It cannot be realized unless  
we all make a commitment and work toward a shared vision for the  
future. Other voices join ours in this look into the future, weighing in,  
sharing perspectives on what a web for everyone is and what we need to  
get there. In the end, we ask you to add your voice.  
# What a Web for Everyone Looks Like  
As we worked on this book, we engaged in conversations at conferences,  
on lists, and on social media. We asked people what they thought it  
would mean to have a web for everyone, and how we would know when  
we had achieved it. Four big themes emerged.  
• It will be flexible. We will all have the option to choose how we  
interact with the web. People have very specific needs and favorite  
emerging technologies, from voice control to specialized visual pre-  
sentation. A web for everyone will let everyone interact in the way  
they like best.  
People will be able to use affordable technology to con-  
sume, view, hear, or feel the information in the way that suits  
them best.  
—Alan Dalton, Accessibility Development Advisor  
National Disability Authority \(Ireland\)  
• It will be ubiquitous. Accessibility will be built into every site from  
the ground up. The operating systems and browsers, and building  
blocks like programming toolkits and website templates, will all start  
accessible. The work to build accessibility support into everything,  
from basic languages like HTML5 and popular platforms like Word-  
Press and jQuery, is the basis for this future.  
Learning to code to standards, and then actually being  
required to do so, will be enough.  
—Jennifer Sutton, Independent Consultant  
The Future\: Design for All 211 • It will be central to our work process. Dozens of people pointed out  
that all the “ilities”—reliability, quality, usability, security, and so on—  
must be part of the process from the beginning. None of them can be  
a single task, added at the end of a project, like one more feature; their  
principles must be “baked in.” The same goes for accessibility.  
As we say, if it isn’t usable for everyone, it can’t be accessible  
to anyone. \(Perhaps not strictly true, but it makes an impor-  
tant point.\)  
—Cliff Tyllick  
Senior Manager, Web Accessibility  
• It will be invisible. Like good design, good accessibility is invisible. It  
doesn’t draw attention or require special consideration. It just works  
and makes people more successful.  
A web for everyone is a reflection of a universal acknowledge-  
ment that we are all human beings. We will know that we have  
reached it when we are no longer talking about it.  
—Christopher Phillips  
Web Developer and Disability Services Manager  
# What We Need to Do to Get There  
William Gibson famously said, “The future is already here; it’s just not  
evenly distributed.” This is as true with accessibility as with anything  
else. It’s easy to pay attention to cool new technologies, but much harder  
to focus on the basics like designing to standards and making a site or  
app accessible.  
Get out in front with web accessibility  
The future is already here. There are technology innovations that  
empower people with disabilities. Thinking back on our personas, we  
can see innovations that helped each of them use the web more easily.  
• In 2010, when Apple introduced the first iPad, it included VoiceOver,  
giving Jacob a screen reader built into the operating system. Assis-  
tive Touch helps Emily interact more easily, and Guided Access gives  
Trevor the focused experience he needs.  
• Voice recognition has gone from clunky to sleek with Siri in iOS and  
Voice Input in Android for Lea, Jacob, and Carol.  
212 Chapter 12 • YouTube supports captions for Steven, including multiple languages  
for Vishnu and Maria. For everyone, there are tools that make cap-  
tions much easier to create.  
In the few years we worked on this book, the pace of innovation has  
only increased. Look at your own technology, and you can probably find  
something that didn’t exist \(or work well enough to be common\) just a  
few years ago, but that has changed your life in some way.  
But the future is also unevenly distributed. Websites and web applica-  
tions have not enjoyed the same careful attention to the needs of people  
with disabilities.  
Unfortunately, at present we tend to go two steps forward and  
one back, as new technologies come out.  
—David Andrews, Chief Technology Officer  
Minnesota State Services for the Blind  
Some large companies embrace accessibility, on financial, medical,  
shopping, and entertainment sites. But there are still too many valu-  
able, interesting sites and apps launched that are simply not accessible.  
It’s unlikely that anyone on those teams consciously intended to exclude  
people with disabilities, but working with a disregard for accessibility  
has the same result.  
The pace of technological change, especially disruptive tech-  
nologies, means that we are not heading toward a particular  
planned goal, but we are constantly playing catch-up with  
wherever technology takes us. Somehow, we need to make  
accessibility sexy and cool.  
— Steve Green, Test Partners, Ltd.  
To start, we must put attention and resources toward web accessibility.  
Build awareness and understanding  
of more diverse people  
User experience—and a web for everyone—starts with people. After all,  
if you don’t know your audience, how can you design for them?  
The personas in this book are a first step. Perhaps they helped you think  
more widely about accessibility. As an early reviewer of the book said,  
“I had no idea that someone with fibromyalgia might have any special  
computer needs.”  
The Future\: Design for All 213 In a presentation about cross-cultural design, Jean-Luc Doumont said,  
“To sharpen your cross-cultural skills, experience more cultures first-  
hand.” The same principle applies to accessibility\: to sharpen your  
accessibility skills, get to know more people with disabilities.  
It’s not hard, if you take the time to look. After the Society for Techni-  
cal Communication \(STC\) started writing accessibility guides to their  
conference, they discovered more benefits than they originally imagined.  
Wheelchair users said that they had the confidence to attend because of  
the information the guides provided.  
When you recruit people for usability testing or user research,  
make the point of welcoming people with disabilities—and  
then really do it. You might be surprised at the range of  
people you find and what they need to be successful.  
—Caroline Jarrett, User Experience Consultant  
Get support for accessibility into  
mainstream products  
Mainstream accessibility features in technology tools started when both  
Apple and Microsoft built access tools into the operating systems with  
tools like high contrast settings and StickyKeys, which let people type  
key combinations \(like Ctrl+C\) as a sequence, to minimize the physical  
effort and dexterity needed to operate a keyboard.  
In the past, many sites offered built-in controls to allow users to enlarge  
text or change colors. But now, browsers can do much of the work with  
text settings and zoom. Apple also led the way to more flexible devices  
when it included VoiceOver in iPhones, iPads, and iPods.  
We will know when we have reached the goal when accessibil-  
ity is not a separate consideration, when it is baked into the  
infrastructure and we don’t have to worry about it.  
—David Andrews, Chief Technology Officer  
Minnesota State Services for the Blind  
This trend is important because it’s difficult for separate assistive tech-  
nology products to keep up with innovations and new products, and it’s  
difficult for their users to manage updates and changes. Jacob may enjoy  
the challenge of learning how to make new products work for him, but  
many people do not.  
214 Chapter 12 Many people complained that new versions of browsers and websites  
disabled adaptations that worked for them. Others dream of a time when  
their favorite technology will work better. Tema Frank who, like Lea,  
finds that just using a keyboard or mouse can be painful, dreamed of  
speech recognition so good that people could “interact with their com-  
puters a la Star Trek.”  
When features like Apple’s Siri or the speech input on Android are part  
of everyone’s mobile device, technologies can quickly go from an experi-  
mental novelty to a dream come true, with effective tools that people can  
count on.  
We’ll know when we’ve reached this goal when, for example,  
how a screen reader works will no longer be relevant.  
— Jennifer Sutton, Independent Consultant  
There are many more examples. Bar codes and QR codes have revolu-  
tionized commerce systems. They are used to inventory products as  
they arrive in the store, identify those products as they are bought, and  
route packages to customers. Those same QR codes can help consumers  
shop, providing links to detailed product information or pricing. And,  
they help people with visual disabilities identify packages. Personal code  
readers used to be big, clunky things, but now they are just another app  
on a smart phone.  
My goal is to make at least the software side of accessibility  
so that it is a utility. So it doesn’t cost a user several hundred  
or several thousand dollars in some cases to acquire the AT  
that they need in order to be a productive person in their day-  
to-day life, in their work life, in their education, but rather it  
becomes something that businesses distribute, through their  
interfaces, software, environments.  
—Mike Paciello, The Paciello Group  
Make accessibility part of how we think  
Accessibility starts from the way we think about our work, from first  
inspirations to well beyond launch. Another common theme for the  
future was the need to incorporate accessibility thinking into education  
and training, in design, computer science, engineering, psychology, com-  
munications, and business.  
The Future\: Design for All 215 For example, at Michigan State University, first-year engineering stu-  
dents are given projects that concern addressing the needs of people  
with disabilities. Sarah Swierenga, the Director of the Usability and  
Accessibility Research Center, points out what a profound influence this  
early exposure can have. “Once you’ve had to think deeply about disabili-  
ties and human diversity, you will always think about it. Accessibility  
will always be part of your work.”  
Ten years ago, most people thought of websites as pages on  
a desktop computer, designed for people with perfect vision,  
perfect hearing, perfect motor skills, perfect memory, and per-  
fect understanding. Now, designers, developers, owners, and  
users are regularly experiencing websites on multiple devices,  
at multiple sizes, in all sorts of conditions, and this will help  
them to empathize with users of all abilities.  
—Alan Dalton, Accessibility Development Advisor  
National Disability Authority \(Ireland\)  
Don’t launch until it’s accessible  
In Chapter 4, “Solid Structure,” we looked at how web standards are  
an important step to accessibility and a web for everyone. Designing  
and building to standards is the solid base on which the site or app can  
be built. The next step is meeting the requirements in WCAG 2.0 and  
national regulations.  
Web standards are like curb cuts. They have value beyond their original  
purpose. Curb cuts were originally created for people who used wheel-  
chairs, but helped people with carts, strollers, bicycles, and luggage.  
Similarly, both responsive design and accessibility rely on strong stan-  
dards for the broad benefits they create.  
The commitment to accessibility can’t stop there, however. Don’t con-  
sider a site or app done until everyone can use it. It is unfortunate when  
a small, basic accessibility bug keeps some people from using a site, par-  
ticularly when the problem could easily be prevented.  
Make sure that the content is accessible with good headings \(using cor-  
rect markup\), alt text for images, captions for video, and transcripts for  
audio. Steven, Jacob, Maria, Vishnu, and Trevor will all thank you, along  
with anyone who would rather skim through a text version of a speech or  
watch a video with the sound off.  
216 Chapter 12 Sometimes, the secret is to “just ask.” When Gerry Gaffney interviewed  
Shawn Henry for his podcast, UXPod, she asked him to post it only when  
he had a transcript available so that both the recorded interview and  
the transcript would launch together. Now, that process is part of his  
normal routine.  
# Now, to the Future  
And so we come to the end of this book, but not the end of the story. Your  
journey continues from here. It’s up to you to make the good stories that  
take the vision of a web for everyone from theory to reality.  
We want to tell the good stories about those who have done  
the right thing and have done a good job. That will encourage  
others to follow.  
—Ben Shneiderman, Human-Computer Interaction Lab  
Now, it’s all up to you. See you—see everyone!—on the web.

# WCAG 2.0  
Cross-Reference The accessible UX principles and guidelines in this book are orga-  
nized around the user experience and how the design and coding  
of a website supports users.  
In this section, we have matched our accessible UX principles and guide-  
lines with the guidelines and detailed requirements \(called success  
criteria\) in WCAG 2.0 so that you can see the technical requirements for  
accessibility that support accessible design. Where there is no corre-  
sponding WCAG requirement, we provide other helpful resources. Some  
WCAG 2.0 criteria match more than one accessible UX guideline, show-  
ing how different UX specialists share responsibility for creating a web  
for everyone.  
For each accessible UX principle, we also identify which of the WCAG  
2.0 principles that form the foundation of web accessibility \(Perceivable,  
Operable, Understandable, and Robust\) are important in thinking about  
creating an experience that includes everyone.  
Your project may be aiming for one of the WCAG 2.0 levels of confor-  
mance \(A, AA, and AAA\). When you think about accessible UX, you may  
find that a higher level requirement is easy to meet for some guidelines,  
adding to the overall accessibility of your site.  
t I p S U M M a ry of a nd S U CC e SS WCAG 2 .o G U I D e L I n es

A quick reference table of WCAG 2.0 guidelines and success  
criteria and the chapters in the book where they are covered  
can be found at the end of this appendix. The list of Accessible  
UX principles and guidelines can be downloaded from the  
book site.  
226 Appendix B People First\: Designing for Differences  
People are the first consideration, and sites are designed with the  
needs of everyone in the audience in mind.  
The personas in this book are examples of people with disabilities  
and how they use the web and technology. Designing for Inclusion  
\(www.w3.org/WAI/users/Overview.html\) has good materials on how  
people with disabilities use the web and how to involve users in web  
projects. Appendix C, “More Reading,” has a list of resources on assistive  
technology and disability statistics.  
# Clear Purpose\: Well-Defined Goals  
People enjoy products that are designed for the audience and  
guided by a defined purpose and goals.  
As a technical standard, WCAG 2.0 does not have much to say about  
strategy and goals; however, other documents of the Web Accessibil-  
ity Initiative \(WAI\) do. In particular, Planning and Implementing Web  
Accessibility \(www.w3.org/WAI/managing.html\) has helpful guides  
for establishing support for accessibility. These materials provide useful  
background and context when thinking about the accessibility goals for  
a project.  
# Solid Structure\: Built to Standards  
People feel confident using the design because it is stable, robust,  
and secure.  
The Accessible UX guidelines for solid structure map to the fourth prin-  
ciple of WCAG 2.0\: Robust. That is, sites must be coded so that they can  
be read by a variety of browsers and other technologies for accessing the  
web, including assistive technologies. Solid structure is also important  
to make a site Perceivable.  
WCAG 2.0 Cross-Reference 227 TaBLe B.1 SOLID STRUCTURE  
Accessible UX WCAG 2.0 \(or other resources\)  
Code content to be  
machine-readable.  
Code to standards.  
Use standard web  
technologies.  
Use stylesheets to  
separate content and  
presentation.  
Use semantic markup for  
content.  
1.3.1 Info and Relationships\: Information, structure,  
and relationships conveyed through presentation can  
be programmatically determined, or are available in  
text \(Level A\).  
3.1.1 Language of Page\: The default human language  
of each web page can be programmatically  
determined \(Level A\).  
3.1.2 Language of Parts\: The human language  
of each passage or phrase in the content can be  
programmatically determined except for proper  
names, technical terms, words of indeterminate  
language, and words or phrases that have  
become part of the vernacular of the immediately  
surrounding text \(Level AA\).  
4.1 Compatible\: Maximize compatibility with  
current and future user agents, including assistive  
technologies \(Guideline\).  
4.1.1 Parsing\: In content implemented using markup  
languages, elements have complete start and  
end tags, elements are nested according to their  
specifications, elements do not contain duplicate  
attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the  
specifications allow these features \(Level A\).  
4.1.2 Name, Role, Value\: For all user interface  
components \(including but not limited to\: form  
elements, links and components generated by  
scripts\), the name and role can be programmatically  
determined; states, properties, and values that can  
be set by the user can be programmatically set; and  
notification of changes to these items is available  
to user agents, including assistive technologies  
\(Level A\).  
Organize code for clarity  
and flow.  
1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence\: When the sequence in  
which content is presented affects its meaning, a  
correct reading sequence can be programmatically  
determined \(Level A\).  
2.4.3 Focus Order\: If a web page can be navigated  
sequentially and the navigation sequences affect  
meaning or operation, focusable components  
receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and  
operability \(Level A\).  
228 Appendix B Easy Interaction\: Everything Works  
People can use the product across all modes of interaction and  
operating with a broad range of devices.  
The Accessible UX guidelines for easy interaction focus on the elements of  
the user interface, and map primarily to the WCAG 2.0 principle, Operable.  
Many of the WCAG 2.0 operability requirements are intended to ensure that  
users are able to interact with the site through assistive technology.  
TaBLe B. 2 EASY INTERACTION  
Accessible UX Identify and describe  
interactive elements.  
Use basic HTML codes  
correctly.  
WCAG 2.0 \(or other resources\)  
3.3.2 Labels or Instructions\: Labels or instructions are  
provided when content requires user input \(Level A\).  
4.1.2 Name, Role, Value\: For all user interface  
components \(including but not limited to\: form  
elements, links and components generated by  
scripts\), the name and role can be programmatically  
determined; states, properties, and values that can  
be set by the user can be programmatically set; and  
notification of changes to these items is available to  
user agents, including assistive technologies \(Level A\).  
Use WAI-ARIA for  
complex elements.  
WAI-ARIA \(Accessible Rich Internet Applications\)  
is a separate W3C standard for making dynamic  
content and controls accessible by adding codes  
that describe the widget or region of a page to  
assistive technology \(www.w3.org/WAI/intro/  
aria.php\). The WAI-ARIA Design Patterns provide  
instruction for creating accessible widgets  
\(www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/\#aria\_ex\).  
Use features of the  
technology platform.  
The WCAG 2.0 guidelines are written to be  
technology-neutral, covering both HTML and  
other programming languages, rather than writing  
prescriptive advice for how to implement the  
requirements of each system or platform. To provide  
implementation advice, each requirement is linked  
to information \(called Sufficient Techniques and  
Advisory Techniques\) about how to meet it. The  
full list of How to Meet WCAG 2.0 can be filtered by  
technology \(www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/\).

Support keyboard  
interaction.  
2.1 Keyboard Accessible\: Make all functionality  
available from a keyboard \(Guideline\).  
2.1.1 Keyboard\: All functionality of the content is  
operable through a keyboard interface without  
requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes,  
except where the underlying function requires input  
that depends on the path of the user’s movement  
and not just the endpoints \(Level A\).  
2.1.3 Keyboard \(No Exception\)\: All functionality of  
the content is operable through a keyboard interface  
without requiring specific timings for individual  
keystrokes \(Level AAA\).  
2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\: If keyboard focus can be  
moved to a component of the page using a keyboard  
interface, then focus can be moved away from that  
component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it  
requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or  
other standard exit methods, the user is advised of  
the method for moving focus away \(Level A\).  
2.4.3 Focus Order\: If a web page can be navigated  
sequentially and the navigation sequences affect  
meaning or operation, focusable components  
receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and  
operability \(Level A\).  
2.4.7 Focus Visible\: Any keyboard operable user  
interface has a mode of operation where the  
keyboard focus indicator is visible \(Level AA\).  
Make controls large  
enough to operate  
easily.  
Because WCAG 2.0 emphasizes the ability to  
customize the interface, it does not include any  
requirements for the size and spacing of controls,  
especially for touch screens. However, guidelines for  
touch-screen voting systems provide some guidance,  
requiring a minimum size of 0.5 inches high and 0.7  
inches wide, with at least 0.1 inches between touch  
controls in either direction.  
230 Appendix B TaBLe B. 2 EASY INTERACTION \(CONTINUED\)  
Accessible UX Let users control  
the operation of the  
interface.  
WCAG 2.0 \(or other resources\)  
3.2 Predictable\: Make web pages appear and  
operate in predictable ways \(Guideline\).  
3.2.1 On Focus\: When any component receives focus,  
it does not initiate a change of context \(Level A\).  
3.2.2 On Input\: Changing the setting of any user  
interface component does not automatically cause a  
change of context unless the user has been advised of  
the behavior before using the component \(Level A\).

Index 265 Acknowledgments  
It takes a village to build an accessible website, and just as large and  
varied a group of people to help us write this book.  
The people we profile in the book were generous with their time, often  
talking to us for several hours, and then later reviewing the book.  
Thanks to Giles Colborne, Ethan Marcotte, Derek Featherstone, Valerie  
Fletcher, Steve Faulkner, Larry Goldberg, Mike Paciello, Ginny Redish,  
and Ben Shneiderman.  
We are grateful to Aaron Gustafson for his beautiful foreword,  
reminding us that for all our technological advances, it all comes down  
to recognizing everyone’s humanity.  
Still more people provided valuable feedback, ideas, and assistance in  
working through the ideas in this book. Thanks to Jimmy Chandler,  
Dana Chisnell, Gerry Gaffney, Caroline Jarrett, Steve Krug, Jonathan  
Lazar, Karen Mardahl, Amanda Nance, Daivee Patel, Sharron  
Rush, Glenda Sims, Julie Strothman, and Jennifer Sutton. Hallway  
conversations and social media exchanges with too many people to  
count, let alone mention, helped shape our thoughts over the years. Calls  
for help to \#accessibility on Twitter and the WebAIM discussion group  
provided fact checks and more ideas.  
Thank you, Marta Justak, Lou Rosenfeld, Karen Corbett, Danielle Foster,  
and everyone at Rosenfeld Media.  
The personas were brought to life by Tom Biby, who worked with us to  
pack a lot of information into a set of small images. Drew Davies also  
assisted with diagrams and illustrations, making clear concepts out  
of our scribbles.  
Even more people gave us permission to use part of their work in ours,  
for which we are enormously grateful. They include Deborah Adler,  
Naomi Alderman, David Andrews, Boér Attila \(calcium.ro\), Tom Biddle,

Sarah Horton  
Sarah has spent most of her career working in tech-  
nology in higher education. She started her career  
in interaction design in 1991 at the Yale Center for  
Advanced Instructional Media, creating award-  
winning interactive instructional software. She was  
an instructional technologist at Dartmouth College for 11 years before  
becoming Dartmouth’s Director of Web Strategy and Design, leading  
a team of user-experience professionals responsible for web and media  
design, development, and production. Most recently Sarah was Web  
Strategy Project Lead at Harvard University, responsible for strategy and  
user experience design for the Harvard Web Publishing Initiative.  
In the late 1990s, early 2000s, accessibility became part of the discourse  
when considering strategies for using technology to support teaching and  
learning. The use of technology is both an opportunity and a potential bar-  
rier for students with disabilities. For Sarah, bringing accessibility to the  
discussion and making design decisions that would improve accessibility  
gave design and the design process a clear purpose and meaning. She got  
on board with accessibility and hasn’t looked back since.  
In 2013 Sarah left higher education to work full-time in accessibility.  
She joined The Paciello Group, a.k.a. TPG, as Director of Accessible User  
Experience and Design. In this role she helps leading companies and orga-  
nizations identify barriers that may keep people with disabilities from  
getting information, making connections, doing stuff, and learning new  
things. She helps devise solutions to provide an equitable user experi-  
ence. She also helps integrate accessibility into practice, through process  
reviews, training, and usability testing. It is a great time to be working in  
accessibility, as many companies and organizations are making a commit-  
ment to accessibility as a core value, rather than an afterthought.  
Sarah is a prolific writer and presenter. She is co-author with Pat-  
rick Lynch of Web Style Guide, now in its third edition and translated  
into eight languages. She also wrote Web Teaching Guide, which won  
the American Association of Publishers award for the Best Book in  
Computer Science in 2000. Her third book, Access by Design, com-  
bines the disciplines of universal design, accessibility, and usability  
268 into guidelines for designing websites that are universally usable. Her  
publication and presentation credits also include the New York Times,  
Peachpit, and Digital Web Magazine, and the International Cross-Dis-  
ciplinary Workshop on Web Accessibility \(W4A\), WebVisions, World  
Usability Day, and the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory Annual  
Symposium.

Whitney Quesenbery  
Whitney combines a fascination with people and  
an obsession to communicate clearly with her  
goal of bringing user research insights to design-  
ing products where people matter. She has worked  
with organizations such as The Open University,  
National Cancer Institute, Pearson, Sage, Neat, Amtrak, HHS, Apogee,  
and IEEE.  
Her first two books—Storytelling for User Experience\: Crafting Stories for  
Better Design \(with Kevin Brooks for Rosenfeld Media\) and Global UX\:  
Design and Research in a Connected World \(with Daniel Szuc\)—help prac-  
titioners keep users in mind throughout the creative process.  
She’s also passionate about civic design. As co-director of the non-profit  
Center for Civic Design with Dana Chisnell, she works with election offi-  
cials on usability and design of ballots and other election materials. They  
publish the popular Field Guides to Ensuring Voter Intent, which provide  
researched guidelines in a handy pocket format. Their work is funded  
by the MacArthur Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, and the  
National Science Foundation.  
Whitney is a co-author of two influential Brennan Center reports that  
show just how much design matters in elections. From 2004 to 2009, she  
was chair for Human Factors and Privacy for the Elections Assistance  
Commission’s committee developing voting system guidelines.  
Her interest in accessibility and civic design came together when  
she served as UPA’s representative on the Access Board’s advisory  
About the Authors 269 committee, drafting updates for the U.S. “Section 508” accessibility  
regulations. She managed an EAC grant for accessible voting technology  
that brought together researchers and election officials in a dozen  
projects, including the influential Anywhere Ballot and an OpenIDEO  
design challenge.  
Whitney has been part of events and publications around the world,  
including World Usability Day, User Friendly, Fluxible, Agile, UXPA, STC,  
SIG-CHI, CSUN, AccessU, Web Accessibility Initiative research sympo-  
sia, PlainTalk, UX Australia, the Accessibility Summit, and has given  
testimony for the Presidential Commission on Election Administration.  
Before she was seduced by a little, beige computer into software, usabil-  
ity, and interface design, Whitney was a theatrical lighting designer on  
and off Broadway, learning about storytelling from some of the masters.
