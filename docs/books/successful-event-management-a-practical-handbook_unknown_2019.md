events. My advice to the reader is to take this book as a complete approach\: not just  
the text, but also the diagrams, case studies and the discussion questions set in the  
case studies. This will help you learn more. For the beginner, or someone wanting ‘a  
thirty-minute guide’ to organising events, your first step is to look at the forms listed  
in the front of the book to give you some idea of what you are going to need, and  
then start with chapter five.  
I have taken a deliberately European approach. This is for two reasons. Firstly,  
many of the range of books in this subject area of events management are either  
American or Australian and tend to contain examples \(especially the American texts\)  
which may not have huge relevance to the European experience. Secondly, and per-  
haps more importantly, because we, as Europeans, do not explore the extent and  
quality of our knowledge and mutual experience sufficiently. Partly this was due to  
language barriers and to perceived cultural differences. However, in the age of the  
internet and in the twenty-first century, language is an increasing irrelevance, when  
the common language of the net is English, and culturally, well, we are Europeans.  
More unites us than divides us, as most young people, having backpacked their  
way around the continent and drunk cappuccinos in open-air cafés from Galway to  
Genoa, know very well. This being the case, the book contains material from all over  
Europe and all money is stated in Euros. As a convention, all case study material is  
real as named. However, some more generalised examples are given to illustrate the  
text and to help the reader; in these cases the fictitious town of ‘Middleburg’ is used.  
We are aware of the limitation of generic examples, but this one remains for the pres-  
ent. For those who live in the Dutch provincial capital of Middelburg, or any Euro-  
pean town from Mittelburg to Middlesborough, I hope you will excuse this small  
liberty and not search too hard for the Arboretum, the Venetian Bridge or the pub.  
I am extremely grateful for the contributions made to this book by many people  
and organisations and I thank most kindly all those who have contributed in some  
way, great or small, and in particular for this edition, our reviewers. We cannot, of  
course, accommodate everything which has been fed back, but in this fifth edition  
I have taken the opportunity to revise those sections of the book that most needed  
bringing up to date. I have paid attention to the case study material and have added  
a number of new cases, and revised and brought up to date virtually all others. Most  
especially I have overhauled the reference material, I have also included suggested  
weblinks and YouTube clips, but the reader must be aware that link rot affects any-  
thing on the web, and what is current and available as I write this edition may not  
remain on the web even by the time the book is published. This is a risk we take  
and it is still within the ability of all who read this book to search for supporting

# 3  
# Introduction  
Events have long played an important role in human society. The tedium of daily  
life, with its constant toil and effort, was broken up by events of all kinds. In most  
societies, the slightest excuse could be found for a good celebration, although  
traditional celebrations often had strict ceremonies and rituals. In Europe, partic-  
ularly before the industrial revolution, routine daily activities were regularly inter-  
spersed with festivals and carnivals. Personal events or local events to celebrate  
certain times of year, perhaps related to religious holy days, were also common.  
This role in society was, and is, of considerable importance. In the modern world  
some of the historic driving forces for events have changed. For example, religious  
reasons for staging major festivals have, perhaps, become less important, but we  
still see carnivals, fairs and festivals in all sorts of places and at various times  
of year, locally, nationally and internationally \(Ferdinand et al., 2017\). Many of  
these events, although traditional in origin, play a contemporary role by attract-  
ing tourists \(and thus tourist income\) to a particular place. Some major events,  
however, still revolve around periods such as Christmas or Easter in the Christian  
calendar, and towns and cities throughout Europe often hold major festivals based  
on these times. Even in those countries where religion is no longer as important  
as it once was, the celebration of originally religious, and other folk festivals, still  
takes place; so do older festivals related to the seasons, including the celebration  
of spring, with activities such as dancing round a maypole, decorating water wells  
or crowning the Lord and Lady of May. Harvest time continues to provide a rea-  
son for a seasonal celebration in rural locations. At the same time, many historic,  
traditional or ‘folk’ ceremonies and rituals are, in practice, recent inventions or  
recreations.  
We can grasp therefore that **special events** were often historically crucial to the  
social fabric of day-to-day life. In modern times we are often so used to special events  
that we do not necessarily see them in this context \(e.g. Mother’s Day\). It is also  
sometimes difficult for the student of events to understand the full extent of these  
activities, their variety, their role and how they are run. Unlike many industries we  
cannot say, ‘Well, this industry is worth maybe €30 billion a year,’ or whatever. In  
fact, it is quite difficult to quantify in monetary terms how much events are worth  
‘as an industry’ due to opaque definitions and overlapping market sector boundaries.  
Such a calculation is problematic, because the range of events is vast, from big inter-  
nationally organised sports spectaculars such as the Olympics, to the family naming  
ceremony of the new baby next door. All we can reasonably say, perhaps, is that we  
can look at any one event in isolation and see what value or pleasure it generates.  
Indeed, certain events have the purpose of creating wealth or economic value in some  
way, as well as entertaining and cementing society, but these are not the only reasons  
for holding events, nor should they be.  
# Special events  
Special events are that phenomenon arising from those non-routine  
occasions which have leisure, cultural, personal or organisational  
objectives set apart from the normal activity of daily life, and whose  
purpose is to enlighten, celebrate, entertain or challenge the experi-  
ence of a group of people.

# Definitions and frameworks  
For the student of events, we have to provide some context or framework to begin to  
understand the nature of the activity and the issues about management and organi-  
sation surrounding it. This being the case, and for convenience, we need to attempt  
both a definition and a means of classification\:  
Authors such as Goldblatt \(2014\) have chosen to highlight the celebratory aspect  
of events\:  
# product  
# launches  
A ‘show’ to  
introduce an  
audience, such  
as the media, to  
a new product or  
service. It may  
also be aimed at  
an organisation’s  
internal manage-  
ment and staff,  
sales force or  
external dealers  
and customers.  
# participants  
A person attend-  
ing an event  
who is actively  
taking part in it,  
or in some activity  
related to it.  
‘Special events\: a unique moment in time celebrated with ceremony and  
ritual to achieve specific objectives.’  
Although this definition clearly works for events like weddings, parades, inaugura-  
tions, and so on, it works less well for activities like engineering exhibitions, sports  
competitions, **product launches**, etc. Getz \(2005\), in referring to the experience that  
**participants** have, states\:  
‘To the customer or guest, a special event is an opportunity for a ­ leisure,  
social or cultural experience outside the normal range of choices or  
beyond everyday experience.’  
This definition, too, has its advantages, but also seems to exclude organisational  
events of various kinds. Nevertheless, it is a place to start and from it we can begin  
to look at the vast range of events that take place.  
To do so, it helps to have some means of classification \(Bassett and Dowson,  
2018\). Figure 1.1, for convenience, splits events into four broad categories based  
on the concept \(in our definition\) of events having leisure, cultural, personal or  
organisational objectives. It is crucial to bear in mind, when considering this cate-  
gorisation, that there are frequent overlaps. For example, the graduation of a stu-  
dent from university is both a personal event for the student and their family, and  
an organisational event for the university. A village carnival is both a cultural event,  
perhaps celebrating some aspect of local heritage or folklore, and a leisure event,  
possibly both for local people and for tourists. Therefore, overlaps should be seen as  
inevitable rather than exceptional, and any attempt to categorise an event, even by  
analysing its objectives, its organisers or its origins, will have to take account of this,  
even if we can agree that a particular event does fall into such and such a category.

# 5  
# cAtegories and typologies  
In the following section we will begin to consider how this proposed categorisation  
might be developed to take in the great variety of events. It is a useful starting point,  
and one we can adopt to help us look at the context and precedents for modern  
events, and as a means of understanding their breadth and variety.  
In looking at the various kinds of special events, whether these are leisure-based,  
personal, cultural or organisational, it is possible to identify a number of character-  
istics that they have in common, thus helping us understand what special events are  
and how they work, as well as differentiating them from other activities.  
Our definition of events could be given a shorthand version\: ‘Those non-routine  
occasions set apart from the normal activity of daily life of a group of people’ but  
this may not necessarily give a feel for the specialised nature of the activity. We can  
say specialised because of the uniqueness of events, but also because such events  
may often be celebratory or ceremonial in some way. This is an aspect that other  
authors, including Goldblatt, have highlighted. Clearly this approach can be applied  
to activities such as weddings, product launches, prizegivings, etc. On the other hand,  
it may be less suited to events such as exhibitions, sport days or annual **conferences**,  
although it can be argued that even an exhibition of paintings or a sales conference  
may have an element of ceremony about it, since someone has to open it; but insofar  
as exhibitions, conferences, and so on are non-routine, the definition is usable. For

the purpose of illustrating the four categories, and to demonstrate historical progres-  
sion, this chapter explores four case studies\: for leisure events, the ancient Olympic  
Games; for personal events, a Roman wedding; for cultural events, the Royal Dia-  
mond Jubilees of 1897 and 2012 \(which, for those interested in the overlaps, could  
also be said to be political and therefore organisational\); and for organisational  
events themselves, the Paris Exposition of 1889.  
Special events vary tremendously in size and complexity, from the simple and small,  
such as the village fête, to the huge, complex and international, such as the Olympic  
Games \(Gammon et al., 2015\). To understand the relative levels of complexity involved  
we can attempt to provide a typology. It is necessary to consider events as having both  
organisational complexity and uncertainty. Complexity is fairly easy to understand,  
whereas uncertainty, as a concept, is a little more problematic. By uncertainty we mean  
initial doubt about such issues as the cost, the time schedule and the technical require-  
ments. Thus, it can be understood that, at the beginning, the uncertainty about the  
cost, the timing and the technical needs of organising the Olympic Games far exceeds  
the uncertainty of, say, a training conference or a small wedding reception. In order to  
quantify the complexity, in the typology in Figure 1.2, varying levels of organisational  
complexity have been used, ranging from individual to multinational. Using this typol-  
ogy, it is possible to propose a classification of various events, in order to understand the  
comparative demands that such events might place on organisers or events managers.  
Even where an event is relatively simple, the number of people attending may make  
it very complex indeed. There is a world of difference between a birthday party for  
six people and a birthday party for 60 people, even though the format, structure and  
basic idea may be the same. The typology must be seen with this limitation in mind.  
Indeed, it is this concept of size which often means the difference between an amateur  
organiser or a family member running an event on the one hand, or having to employ  
an event manager, go to a hotel or find specialist advice on the other. Size or number  
of **attendees** is something that easily catches people out. We can all organise a dinner  
party for eight or ten people, even a buffet for maybe 20 or 30, but after that the  
sheer effort involved would overwhelm us\: not enough space, not enough equipment,

contemporary world, whether it concerns the annual dinner of the local town council  
or the organisation of the European Figure Skating Championships, is often about the  
need for trained staff, specialist companies and professional expertise.  
# Historical contexts and precedents  
Events management can be thought of as an art, rather than a science. Historically, the  
organisation of small local events was relatively uncomplicated and needed no extensive  
managerial expertise. The organisation of a wedding, for example, could be done most  
often by the bride’s mother with help from the two families involved and a vicar, priest,  
religious or other official representative. \(In past times, especially up until the Victorian  
period, ‘expert’ advice often came in the form of a Dancing Master, employed to give the  
wedding festivities some formality of style. There were also quite specific local rituals to  
be observed, which acted as ‘checklists’ for the activities.\) Some weddings are still done  
this way, and are within the ability of ­ non-specialist people to organise and run\: the  
bride and groom deal with the ceremony, the bride’s mother or father orders the cake  
and a buffet from a local baker, family and friends do some or all of it; the reception  
is held in one of the family homes or a village hall, flowers come from gardens or are  
obtained from a nearby flower shop, and so on. All these tasks were, and can still be,  
coped with in an intimate and sociable way with no great cost or fuss.  
While special events, by their nature are not routine, pressure for formal organ-  
isational or technological skill was not so great in the past for local, family or  
small-scale events. This is not to say that large-scale events management is a partic-  
ularly recent development, only that the modern world with its many complexities

FACTBOX  
• Ancient Olympic Games first held in 776 BC, last held in 393  
• Restarted in modern times in 1896  
• Held every four years  
• Ancient games were part of the religious festival of Zeus, the chief Greek god  
• Modern games are a major economic activity  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the historical background to the Olympic Games with the  
following objectives\:  
• To consider the historical development of the Games.  
• To highlight comparisons between the ancient Olympics and the modern ones.  
• To understand the differences between the ancient and the modern Games.  
**T** he modern Olympic Games are loosely based  
on the games of the ancient Greeks. Those  
games, first held in 776 BC at Olympia, in Greece,  
had the purpose of celebrating the festival of Zeus,  
the most important Greek god. They were organised  
by the temple priests and their helpers, and car-  
ried on for many years at four-yearly intervals, even  
though Greece was normally at war \(quite usual in  
those times\). One of the most important aspects of  
the games was the truce that existed to allow them  
to take place and to enable the participants, mostly  
the nobility and professional athletes, together with  
pilgrims \(who were travelling to the temple of Zeus  
at Olympia\), to get to the games safely. The ancient

games at first had only one component, the ‘stade’,  
a footrace. Later they included not only the stade  
\(about 150 metres, hence the word ‘stadium’\), but  
also the pentathlon \(the discus, the jump, the javelin,  
another race and wrestling\), together with a chariot  
race, a horse race and the pankration – a very vio-  
lent form of wrestling. All of these were performed  
naked, in the Greek style, although, as the games  
also celebrated military prowess, the final footrace  
was performed in full armour. The games lasted for  
five days and included various religious ceremonies,  
the main religious aspect being the worship of Zeus,  
although the women had their own games in honour  
of the goddess Hera \(married women were not per-  
mitted at the men’s games, even to watch\).  
The games were organised by the religious  
authorities of Olympia and involved professional  
trainers and referees for the events as well as  
judges. There were also social events and, rather  
like the modern games, a parade of champions on  
the final day. The ancient games continued, in all,  
for about 1200 years and were closed down by the  
Roman Emperor Theodosius II in 393. The modern  
# Further Reading  
games began again at Athens in 1896, followed  
by Paris in 1900, and then more or less every four  
years to the present day \(Swadding, 2011; Walle-  
chinskey and Loucky, 2012\).

critique of the Olympics, search\: www.guardian.co.uk/.  
often requires specialists to do what, in gentler times, could be done by thoughtful  
amateurs or ordinary people. We should not mistake history, however. The scale  
and complexity of, say, the Greek or Roman gladiatorial games \(which comprised  
vast numbers of activities, set-piece contests and even theatrically-mounted sea  
battles – the Romans were sufficiently advanced that they could flood their arenas\)  
certainly had what today would be considered as a professional events management  
organisation to run them. This can also be seen in our first case study of the ancient  
Olympic Games, which helps to illustrate our first category of leisure events.  
Looking back in history we can see, however, that events have always had a significant  
role to play in society, either to break up the dull, grinding routine of daily life \(toiling in  
the fields, perhaps\) or to emphasise some important activity or person \(such as the arrival  
of a new abbot at the local monastery\). We can trace all sorts of special events far back  
in time, even if they are the result of some recent ‘re-invention’. For as long as humanity  
has lived in family groups there will have been celebrations of weddings, births, religious  
rites, and so on. In following up the categorisation suggested earlier of events being  
leisure-based, personal, cultural or organisational in origin, we can consequently seek  
various historical examples or precedents. That said, we must be careful not to believe  
that earlier times or other societies had the same cultural attitudes as we have today.  
The second category of special events in our approach is that of personal events.  
This includes all sorts of occasions that a family or friends might be involved in.

Many modern aspects of family life can be seen to revolve around important occa-  
sions\: birthdays, namings, weddings and anniversaries all fall into this category, as do  
many other personal events and celebrations \(a dinner party is a special event in our  
definition\). Of all these, weddings can be one of the most complicated to organise,  
involving friends and family and a whole range of related service activities, from cater-  
ing to entertainment, as well as the formal aspect of the marriage ceremony itself. This  
is not to say that all weddings are a ‘big performance’, some are small, friendly and  
relaxed, and just as good for it – size is no measure of the success of an event. Almost  
all cultures known to history have some form of partnership ceremony, and in looking  
for a historical precedent for personal events, the Romans can provide an example.  
Special events cover all kinds of human and cultural activity, not only sport-  
ing and family activities, but also cultural and commercial or organisational activ-  
ities. Culture, with its associated ceremony and traditions, has a role in both in all  
kinds of social activities\: and for all kinds of people, organisations and institutions.  
\(­ Robinson et al., 2010\). But it has been especially important for governments and  
leaders, such as royalty. In cultural events ceremony becomes very evident, often as a  
way of emphasising the significance of the event itself or of the person at the centre of  
the ceremony, the intended effect being to secure support, or to allow as many people  
as possible to recognise the key individual. For example, the media often show heads  
of state \(kings, queens, presidents\) inspecting a ‘guard of honour’ when arriving at  
the airport of a country they are visiting; they listen to the national anthem and then  
walk past the guard of honour. The original purpose of this ceremony was not for  
the head of state to see the guards, but for the guards to see the head of state, so that  
the guards would recognise the person they were to protect.

FACTBOX  
• The Roman empire covered a huge area of Western Europe, from Britain to north Africa  
• Rome was pagan until the AD300s, when it started to become Christian in religion  
• Roman weddings had many similarities to modern ceremonies, but also a number  
of differences  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider comparisons between a historical ceremony and a mod-  
ern one, in this case a wedding, with the following objectives\:  
• To consider how an ancient wedding was conducted and the differences with a modern wed-  
ding ceremony \(of your choice\).  
• To highlight comparisons between the ancient ceremony and the modern one.  
• To understand that although the ceremony and style may differ, the essential purpose remains  
the same.  
**A** s with modern weddings, Roman weddings  
were organised by the families of the bride and  
groom. A ring was often given as an engagement  
present, although no ring was involved in the cere-  
mony itself until changes in the ritual after the second  
century AD \(Kamm, 2008\). The bride wore a special  
bridal gown, generally with a flame-coloured veil and  
garlands of flowers. The wedding would be arranged  
with the respective families each dealing with vari-  
ous aspects. A legal contract was signed by the two  
fathers on the day of the wedding. The joining of hands  
at the ceremony was ensured, not by a priest, but  
by a married woman, known as a ‘pronuba’. At the  
ceremony, prayers would be said to the family gods  
and especially to the goddess Juno, with a sacrifice  
offered to the god Jupiter. This might involve the sac-  
rifice of a donkey, as donkeys were thought to have  
considerable sexual prowess, and so the offering was  
thought to ensure a suitably exciting wedding night.  
Following the ceremony, the party would make  
their way to the bride’s parents’ house, where there  
would be a major feast in the Roman style, of some  
excess, with large quantities of food and wine being  
consumed. Once the feast was over, there would  
be a torchlight procession from the bride’s parents’  
house to the bridegroom’s house. It would gener-  
ally be led by torch carriers, often children, and  
# Further Reading  
accompanied by flute players and the families, with  
friends, relatives and other locals joining in. There  
would be a great deal of loud and happy singing  
during the procession and the cheerful shouting of  
obscene poetry and jokes, known as ‘Fescennine  
Verses’. This was the Roman equivalent of writing  
obscene messages on the couple’s car with foam,  
and often referred to how ‘well equipped’ the donkey  
was. On arrival at the bridegroom’s house the bride  
would anoint the doorposts with oil as a sign of ded-  
ication to the gods, and the bridegroom would carry  
the bride over the threshold.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. Historical contexts and precedents  
In the Middle Ages, events and ceremonies played a major role, ensuring that  
a dull daily existence was enlivened and that people were entertained, or at  
least impressed. There were no TVs, smartphones, video, movies or the internet  
for entertainment, as all these are less than 100 years old. It was, for example,  
accepted wisdom in England in the Tudor period \(about 1500–1600\) that cere-  
mony was an essential part of showing ‘good government’. ‘In pompous ceremo-  
nies a secret of government doth much consist’ \(Plowden, 1982\). Government,  
in this case, being interpreted as the action of the King or Queen, was expected  
to make a good show, or put on a good display for the people, and the people  
expected to see royalty in all its glory; it was intended to ensure, to a certain  
extent, respect and allegiance.  
One of the things which these historic examples show is that there have long  
been specialists of various kinds to organise events \(the temple priests for the  
Greek Games, the Lord Chamberlain’s department for Queen Elizabeth\). Some  
events, such as the coronation of a King or Queen, have been, and still are, highly  
complex. Very often, where great ceremony was needed for state events, the mil-  
itary could also be called on to help organise them, and army officers were often  
seconded to do just that, as is still the case with much modern state ceremony\:  
parades, state visits, pageants and festivals.  
Although the organisation of historic ceremonial events might be thought of  
as a matter of the injection of military or government organisational skills, very  
often this supposed skill was no such thing. In fact, great historical ceremonial  
disasters were quite common. The modern events manager has no monopoly  
on things going ‘**pear-shaped**’. Many coronations and other great events were  
famously shambolic. Even where these involved a non-military event, such as the  
great fireworks display held in 1749 to celebrate the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, for  
King George II, there was no guarantee of success, in spite of the fact that these  
were organised by George Frederick Handel, the famous composer, and set to his  
music. The fireworks were to be held in a specially-built pavilion in Green Park,  
London. Handel was designated ‘Comptroller of the Fireworks’. This was such a  
major event that a full dress rehearsal was held, which went perfectly. However,  
on the night itself Handel had an argument with Servandoni, the pavilion designer,  
at which swords were drawn, and during the middle of the performance, with 100  
musicians playing and a crowd of over 12,000 people watching, half the pavilion  
burned down.  
The modern world is no different. Faster maybe; more complex perhaps; but no  
less susceptible to things going wrong, falling down, being rained on or flooded out;  
the guest speaker getting stuck in the traffic; acts of God, both tragic or comic; the  
groom still drunk after the stag night, the buffet being dropped on the kitchen floor or  
the bride falling over the cake at the reception. In some ways, events management is a  
rather thankless task, one of those roles where everyone notices when something goes  
wrong, but few people notice the tremendous effort involved in getting even a simple  
event right. Indeed, some of the things that go wrong at an event may be beyond  
the organiser’s ability to prevent\: the weather, the traffic, power failures, and so on.  
Nevertheless, events can be considerable triumphs of organisation and leave  
lasting legacies. The fourth in our categories is the organisational event; this may  
be anything from a political party conference to a motor **show**. There are any  
­ number of suitable examples. Some of the world trade fairs have left interesting  
legacies. As trade and commerce developed following the industrial revolution,  
many countries sought to celebrate and display their industrial achievements.

# London, England Diamond Jubilee Barge  
FACTBOX  
• The Diamond Jubilees of 1897 and 2012  
• Involving Queen Victoria \(1897\) and Queen Elizabeth \(2012\)  
• Main activities were a procession in 1897 and a river pageant in 2012  
• The two events provide an interesting comparison over time  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine a cultural event and how it has changed over time  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the historical changes both in terms of the event and in terms of the nature of the  
nation and its outlook in the two periods.  
• To highlight particular issues such as cost and security and how these have been addressed,  
­ particularly in the 2012 event, by careful consideration of what the event should involve.  
**A** royal Diamond Jubilee is that rarest of occa-  
sions, it generally celebrates 60 years of the  
reign of a monarch and there have been very few of  
them. In England, the most was the Diamond Jubi-  
lee of Queen Elizabeth II, the previous one being the  
Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. There have been  
no others in Europe, though the much-loved Queen  
Wilhelmina of the Netherlands reigned for almost 58  
years and would have celebrated her Jubilee had it  
not been for failing health. However, King Bhumi-  
bol Adulyadej of Thailand celebrated his Diamond  
Jubilee in 2006 at the Dusit Palace in Bangkok and  
His Highness the Aga Khan celebrated his Diamond  
Jubilee in 2017 in Gouvieux, France, at his estate.

# 13  
The comparison between the two UK Diamond  
Jubilees is instructive, insofar as they present a  
picture of the same country, but over a space of  
more than a century, during which change has  
been the only constant feature. When Queen  
­ Victoria celebrated her Diamond Jubilee on  
the 22nd of June 1897, she was Queen of the  
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and  
Empress of India. When Queen Elizabeth cele-  
brated her Diamond Jubilee on the 2nd to the 5th  
June 2012, she was Queen of the United Kingdom  
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Head of  
the Commonwealth. Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in  
1897 saw Britain at the very peak of its powers,  
as the most important industrial nation of its time  
and with an empire that included almost a quar-  
ter of the population of the world. By 2012 the  
position of the United Kingdom was of a modest,  
­ medium-sized European nation.  
This change in both national circumstances  
and national mood was, in effect, shown by the  
differences in the two Jubilees. Queen Victoria’s  
Diamond Jubilee was described as ‘a far grander  
celebration of her reign than her Golden Jubilee  
of the previous decade’. A service of thanksgiving  
took place outside St Paul’s Cathedral, so that the  
Queen could remain in her carriage, as she was too  
frail to climb the cathedral steps. The scope of the  
celebrations was expanded considerably in com-  
parison to her Golden Jubilee of ten years before,  
with a celebration of the British Empire being the  
central focus. Before leaving Buckingham Palace on  
22nd June, the Queen issued a telegraph through-  
out the Empire, saying ‘From my heart I thank  
my beloved people. May God bless them!’ Some  
47,000 troops from all over the Empire were present  
for the celebrations, which included not only the  
main procession on the 22nd of June, but also a  
review of Colonial troops at Windsor. For example,  
many Indian troops participated in the procession  
through London, including the Bengal Lancers, offi-  
cers of the Indian Imperial Service Troops, and the  
Sikhs, who marched alongside the Canadians. The  
Daily Mail, the day afterwards, described the troops  
\(in words which were acceptable at the time\) as  
‘an anthropological museum – a living gazetteer of  
the British Empire’. The military flavour of the jubilee  
also extended to the Royal Navy, with a review of  
the fleet being carried out by the Prince of Wales  
at Spithead which included the first ever vessel  
powered by steam turbines using a propeller, the  
Turbinia. In addition, a charitable and celebratory  
lunch was provided for 40,000 poor people by  
­ Princess Alexandra.  
In comparison the jubilee of 2012 was a much  
more restrained affair. The principal focus of the  
jubilee celebrations in 2012 was a river pageant  
on the Thames in London. From the event man-  
ager’s point of view, we can consider the advan-  
tages of such a choice of main event for the jubilee.  
Firstly, it makes use of a range of resources which  
already exist, but are perhaps under-used. For  
example, the Queen retains 24 Royal Watermen,  
who are responsible for royal visits on the Thames,  
normally using a vessel called *‘The Royal Nore’*.  
River pageants have been seen on the Thames  
since 1453 when the Mayor of London, John Nor-  
man, first held one\: ‘having at his own expense  
built a noble barge, had it decorated with flags  
and streamers, in which he was rowed by water-  
men with silver oars, attended by such of the city  
companies as possessed barges, in a manner so  
splendid that ‘his barge seemed to burn on the  
water’. For Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee,  
however, a private vessel known as the ‘Spirit of  
Chartwell’ was dressed by an award-winning film  
production designer, for use as the Royal barge  
and formed the centrepiece of a 1,000 strong flo-  
tilla of vessels on the Thames. Secondly, the use  
of the Thames provides significant advantages in  
a number of ways. For example, the street con-  
gestion caused by Royal or Mayoral processions  
in London and events such as the Notting Hill Car-  
nival or the London Marathon, is reduced by using  
the Thames for such a major event. It also means  
that the river pageant can be viewed easily from all  
the embankments, paths, gardens and buildings  
along the Thames without the need to put up spe-  
cial seating or viewing areas, or block off streets  
to do so. These advantages also help to reduce  
the costs \(both the direct costs, for example of  
temporary seating, and indirect or hidden costs,  
for example of time lost through congestion or the  
need for huge numbers of extra police\) of putting

on the event. Thirdly, it has an interesting but less  
obvious security advantage, insofar as it enables  
everyone to see and greet the Queen, but insofar  
as she is in the middle of the river, it reduces the  
opportunities for stupidity or feckless behaviour  
and mitigates against other more serious security  
risks as the river is an unfamiliar environment for  
potential terrorists, or greater or lesser fools of one  
kind or another.  
In addition to the river pageant, a service of  
thanksgiving was held at St Paul’s Cathedral, and  
a concert given at Bush House. Beacons were  
lit on hills throughout the country in celebration.  
The celebrations engaged business much more in  
terms of sponsorship of the event than in seeing  
it as an opportunity to promote Britain’s goods to  
overseas markets \(through visitors\) that the 1897  
jubilee had been. In terms of the military aspect,  
Queen Elizabeth’s jubilee had barely any military  
overtones. In 1897, we have noted there were  
47,000 troops involved, but in 2012, there were  
no more than 2,500 military personnel, barely 5  
per cent of those involved in the 1897 jubilee\:  
an interesting comparison between a nation at  
the height of its military and industrial prowess  
in the Victorian age, and the modest one in the  
modern age.

This led to a number of industrial and commercial exhibitions in many major  
cities. Such exhibitions had often developed out of local trade fairs in towns and  
cities around medieval Europe. Fairs had been held for many centuries as a way  
to show off all kinds of products, goods and other wares. One of the first great  
international industrial fairs was the Great Exhibition of London in 1851 \(there  
had been earlier ones, such as that in Paris of 1849\). The Great Exhibition of  
­ London was held in a specially built hall, the Crystal Palace, that housed some  
13,000 exhibitors from all over the world.  
These fairs have taken place at irregular intervals in many major cities ever since.  
Recent fairs or ‘Expos’ have taken place in New York, Montreal, Seville, Hanover  
and Shanghai, with the most recent ones being Milan in 2015 and Astana in 2017.  
In the Victorian period many cities held fairs; not only London, but also Amsterdam  
\(in 1883 with the International Colonial Exposition and several later fairs\), and  
especially Paris, which held a series of fairs from 1855 to 1900 \(and two since, in  
1925 and 1937\). One such event, which has left a very obvious legacy, was the Paris  
Exposition of 1889.

**T** he 1889 Paris Exposition was the idea of the  
French Prime Minister of the time, Jules Ferry.  
He wished to see an exhibition that would demon-  
strate France’s industrial might, its commercial activ-  
ity and engineering skill. The result was the largest,  
most varied and successful world fair ever held until  
that time.  
The fair was opened on 6th May 1889, a won-  
derful spring day, by the French president, Sadi  
Carnot, who rode in a horse-drawn procession from  
the Elysée Palace. The procession, led by a detach-  
ment of mounted cuirassiers, made its way along  
the Champs Elysées and the Avenue Montaigne  
amongst joyful crowds, and entered the exhibition

area passing under the arches of the Eiffel Tower,  
arriving at the Central Dome at 2.00pm. A short  
ceremony took place at which the Exposition was  
formally presented to President Carnot\: ‘This splen-  
did result exceeds all hopes . . . .’ Indeed it did.  
The exposition was huge. It covered the whole of  
the Champ de Mars and the Esplanade des Inva-  
lides, and stretched along the Quai d’Orsay and  
the Trocadero Gardens to the Eiffel Tower, some 95  
hectares, including a huge Ferris wheel. There were  
almost 62,000 exhibitors from all over the world and  
by the time an exhausted President Carnot had left at  
5.30 pm, almost half a million people had streamed  
in through the 22 entrances to the exhibition, which  
then lasted 176 days. Some 32 million people visited  
the fair and amongst the exhibits was the world’s  
first ever motor car, a Benz \(Harris, 2004\).  
The lasting legacy of the exposition is the Eif-  
fel Tower. When the event was being planned, a  
member of the French cabinet, Edouard Lockroy,  
had suggested a thousand-foot tower to highlight  
its importance. The idea of a tower built of iron and  
steel was not new, as one had been suggested by  
the Cornish engineer, Richard Trevithick, in 1833,  
and another by Clarke and Reeves, two American  
engineers, for the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876.  
But it was Gustave Eiffel who supervised the build-  
ing of the Paris tower. It was begun on 26th January  
1887, and opened at 11.50 am on 15th May 1889,  
to Eiffel’s considerable relief, and has been the sym-  
bol of Paris ever since – though for the first 20 or 30  
years it was rather disliked by some.

# cHAracteristics of events  
In our definition of special events, we noted key characteristics of events as  
­ ‘non-routine’ and ‘unique’. However, events have many other characteristics in com-  
mon with all types of services, and in particular with hospitality and leisure services  
of many kinds.  
These characteristics can be grouped together as being\:  
• uniqueness  
• perishability  
• labour-intensiveness  
• fixed timescales  
• intangibility

# Uniqueness  
The key element of all special events is their uniqueness\: each one will be differ-  
ent. This is not to say that the same kind of event cannot be repeated many times,  
but that the participants, the surroundings, the **audience**, or any number of other  
variables will make the event unique. Even where we have looked at those special  
events that are very frequent, such as weddings, all are different because different  
people are involved, the choice of location, the invited guests, the timing, and so on.  
The same is true of events that may have followed the same format for years and  
years. The ancient Olympic Games took place at four-year intervals for nearly 1,200  
years, or put more simply, 300 repeat editions. But each was unique, because each  
had different athletes, different organisers and a different audience. The format also  
changed slowly over time. At the beginning, it was a religious festival for the Greek  
god Zeus, and only a 150-metre footrace, the ‘stade’, was run. At the end, there was  
no major religious aspect, but the athletics had become the main activity, with 12 or  
so different sports in the games.  
The uniqueness of special events is therefore the key to them. We are not doing  
something that is routine, nor are we producing the same item of work repetitively.  
Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that certain types of event do recur; they  
may recur in the same kind of format \(such as weddings – each wedding is different

but the format or structure is similar\), or they may recur on the basis of time interval  
\(such as an annual conference – again the format or structure is the same, but the  
participants and the subject will be different\). Uniqueness alone, however, does not  
make a special event. Events have a number of characteristics and their uniqueness  
is closely related to aspects of perishability and intangibility.  
# seminars  
Describes small  
gatherings similar  
to the break-out  
sessions, where a  
group, but not the  
whole plenary, will  
discuss an issue.  
# capacity  
The maximum  
number of peo-  
ple who can be  
accommodated at  
a venue.  
# Perishability of events  
Almost by definition, if we regard events as ‘unique’, then the event is tremendously  
perishable; it cannot be repeated in exactly the same way. Two birthday parties at the  
same location, with the same number of people, will not be the same. Even where a  
reasonable level of standardisation is possible, for example, with activities such as  
training **seminars**, each will be different and will be very time dependent. They exist  
briefly and cannot be repeated in precisely the same way. Perishability also relates to  
the use of facilities for events. Let us suppose we have a banqueting room. It may be  
used to its peak **capacity** only on Saturdays, for weddings, so the rest of the week its  
revenue-generating potential may not be fully exploited. If the room is empty for even  
one day of the week, the revenue-generating potential of that day is lost forever – it  
is perishable. The room can be used on a different day, but the day it is empty cannot  
be replayed and used.  
One of the key issues, therefore, in the events manager’s role, is the extent to which  
facilities and services can be used effectively, given the uniqueness or irregularity  
\(perhaps better to say infrequency\) of use. In consequence, events can be expensive  
to provide. Many items will have to be produced on a one-off basis and cannot be  
used again. For example, a large banner saying ‘Happy Wedding Anniversary Anna  
and Frederick’ would be a unique item and thus \(relatively\) expensive to provide. On  
the other hand, a banner saying ‘Happy Anniversary’ may have a number of potential  
uses, may be cheaper to produce and could be stored to be used again.  
The issue of perishability also means that events venue managers may have to  
use a variety of techniques, such as differential pricing, to try to encourage activities  
in quiet periods when a facility or service on offer might not sell. Perhaps a mobile  
disco can be obtained at a discount for an event on, say, a Tuesday, rather than at a  
peak period of the week or year, like a Friday or Saturday night or New Year’s Eve.  
This too illustrates the perishability issue; if the disco is not booked one night of the  
week it will have lost that night’s revenue forever.  
# Intangibility  
When you go out to buy a chocolate bar or a pair of socks, you are buying something  
tangible – you can see it and touch it. With events, however, the activity is more or  
less intangible. If you go to a wedding, you will experience the activities, join in, enjoy  
and remember it, but there are only a few tangible things that you might have got  
from it – perhaps a piece of wedding cake and some photographs, or a video you took  
of the happy couple and the rest of the guests. This intangibility is entirely normal  
for service activities\: when people stay in hotel bedrooms they often take home the  
complimentary soaps and shampoos from the bathroom or small gifts left for them.  
These are efforts to make the experience of the event more tangible; a memento

that the experience happened and to show friends and family. It is important for  
**event organisers** to bear this in mind, and that even the smallest tangible item will  
help to sustain people’s idea of how good an event has been. A programme, a guest  
list, postcards, small wrapped and named chocolates, even slightly more ambitious  
giveaways such as badged glasses or commemorative brochures help the process of  
making the intangible more tangible.

# Ritual and ceremony  
For authors such as Goldblatt, ritual and ceremony are the key issues about special  
events, the major characteristics that make them special. In our historical examples it  
was very evident that ritual and ceremony often played an important part. In practice  
many modern ceremonial activities are ‘fossilised’ or reinvented versions of old tradi-  
tions. The original tradition might have had some key role in the ceremony, now for-  
gotten, but the ritual of doing it \(like the inspection of guards of honour\) still continues.  
Often the ritual ceremony is there because it does in fact emphasise the continuity of  
the tradition, even though the reason for the tradition has gone. In Ripon, England, a  
horn is blown at dusk to signify the setting of the night-watch. Now it is just a small  
event for tourists, but in olden days this had real purpose\: the town was in open  
countryside and could be invaded or attacked by barbarians, and the sounding of the  
horn was to set the guard on the town walls and to ensure that the night watchmen,  
known as ‘Wakemen’, came on duty. Even this was not thought enough, and because  
Ripon was a cathedral city, God was appealed to\: ‘If God keep not ye citie, ye wake-  
men waketh in vain.’ Put in modern English, if God didn’t look after the town, the  
watchmen were wasting their time. Thus, for hundreds of years, this short ceremony  
has taken place in Ripon and continues on today, every nightfall. The watch is still  
called to the walls by the City Hornblower, although the walls are long gone and the  
last watchman long dead.  
Modern events may not, in any way, rely on old tradition and established cer-  
emony. An example of a contemporary specially created event is the Golden Bear  
awards ceremony in Berlin, an event to recognise good film-making. This ‘specially  
created’ event is true of all kinds of events; in fact, it is often the case that a town or  
city wishing to attract tourists might do so by creating a new special event, containing  
a wholly new ceremony, something for the visitors to watch. This can be done for  
all kinds of special events, and the creation of new ceremonies and ‘new’ traditions  
is very common, although it can be argued that for a special event to have a ‘tradi-  
tional’ element in it, that element should have some basis – however tenuous – in  
historical reality.  
# Ambience and service  
Of all the characteristics of events, ambience is one of the most important to the  
outcome. An event with the right ambience can be a huge success. An event with  
the wrong ambience can be a huge failure. At a personal event, such as a birthday  
party, the ambience may be simply created by the people who are there, without  
the need for anything else – good company amongst friends can make an excellent  
event \(see Figure 1.4\).

Some events, however, may need a little help to go well. At a birthday party, there  
might be the need for decorations, music and games, as well as food and drink. But  
it is very important to realise that the presence of these elements does not guarantee  
that things will go well\: there can be a wonderful environment, expensive themed  
decor, large amounts of excellent food and drink and the event can still be a flop. One  
of the roles of an events manager is to try and ensure an event succeeds by careful  
attention to detail and by trying to encourage the desired outcome. Nevertheless,  
people cannot be compelled to enjoy themselves. If they’ve had a bad day, or feel  
grumpy, your wonderfully well-organised event might get them in a better mood,  
or . . . it might not.  
# Personal contact and interaction  
In manufacturing situations, customers have no contact with the staff or workers  
producing the goods, only with perhaps the sales team. In service situations, cus-  
tomers have frequent contact with staff, and this often determines the quality or  
otherwise of the experience. People attending events are frequently themselves part  
of the process. For example, the crowd at a sports tournament is not only watching  
the event but is helping to create the atmosphere; it is interacting with itself, with  
participants and staff and is part of the whole experience. Much the same is true  
of the guests at a Christmas party\: it is the guests themselves interacting with each  
other, with the hosts and perhaps with entertainers, that creates the atmosphere and  
contributes to how enjoyable the event is. A room decorated for a party may look  
nice, but will not come to life until it is full of guests.  
Therefore, in considering how to make an event successful, event managers must  
be fully aware that this is largely dependent on the actions and reactions of people  
attending. It is perfectly possible to have the same event twice in a row, such as a  
pageant or procession, and one may be a complete success and the other a complete  
failure, due to audience reactions, interactions or backgrounds. It is therefore vital  
that event planners have a thorough understanding of their attendees.

# Labour-intensiveness  
The more complex and the more unique an event is, the more likely it is to be more  
labour-intensive, both in terms of organisation and of operation. The organisational  
issue relates to the need for relatively complicated planning to enable the service  
delivery to be efficient, or put more simply, for the event to be a good one \(this is  
why some events may be outsourced to event management companies, caterers or  
other types of event suppliers\). The uniqueness of this type of service implies a high  
level of communication between the organiser or **client** and the event manager. Such  
a high level of communication and planning will take time and effort, even where  
the event may be repeating a well-known formula, or operating within a common  
framework such as a conference. The operational element may also require high  
levels of staffing in order to deliver the event properly. A banquet for 300 people  
will require not only food service staff, but bar and drinks staff, kitchen staff, man-  
agement and perhaps support staff, such as cloakroom attendants, cleaners and staff  
to set up and ­ **break-down** the room. Staffing needs are also likely to peak at certain  
times. In the case of the banquet, peak staffing will take place at service time, but  
a long sequence of preparation and close-down has also to be taken into account.  
No two events are likely to require the same number of staff, except insofar as events  
that have an element of routine, such as banquets and conferences, will require a known  
number of staff. Managers can forecast staffing needs for these types of events from  
experience, depending on the number of guests, the types of service, the experience and  
quality of the staff, the time required to complete the service and even the layout of  
the building. The labour-intensiveness of special events is rather less predictable, as it  
depends entirely on the type of event in addition to all the above conditions. An event  
such as an athletic competition will require a completely different staffing structure to  
support it \(including competitors, judges, timekeepers, etc.\) than a company annual  
outing to a theme park. An event manager will have to forecast staffing needs directly  
from the requirements of running the event, based on what the organiser specifies as the  
event’s objectives and needs, and on the experience and forecasts of departmental leaders.

# Fixed timescale  
Events, rather like building projects, run to a fixed timescale, unlike routine activities  
which can carry on indefinitely. The timescale could be very short, such as for the open-  
ing ceremony for a new road, or very long, as with the Paris Exposition noted earlier,  
where the planning phase took about three years. Even these are not extremes. Many  
special events are actually composed of a sequence of short bursts of activity, with  
pauses or breaks in between. Constant ceremony, lasting many hours, might become  
dull and tiring. The example of the jubilees shows that while these events lasted several  
days, they were composed of several shorter activities of varying lengths, with breaks,  
depending on what was going on and why. For those planning special events, this issue  
of timing must be kept in mind; for an event to be successful and striking, it will need  
to hold people’s attention and interest them, and it is better that this is broken up into  
sections than it takes place all at once, without a respite. This is not to say that the  
fixed timescale cannot be varied. Some events, such as a birthday party, may carry on  
longer than intended because ‘it just happened’, other events may even be extended in  
a planned way, for some special reason, e.g. to recover the costs or to deal with extra  
demand, or, of course, they may be shortened because of lack of interest.

# Summary  
**S** pecial events have always had a major role to play in human  
society. In many respects, modern events are not much different  
from those of ancient times, especially in helping to enliven daily life. In  
understanding this, we can also see that society has developed and  
changed. Increasing public knowledge and technology often mean  
higher expectations of modern events. Whatever role events play in  
the social context, the management of them can be seen as a service  
activity. This context helps us understand how events work, what their  
major elements are and how we can classify them.

# 25  
# Introduction  
It is very common for individuals and organisations to wish to quantify things – we  
like to be able to say that a particular industry or its market is a particular size.  
There are several reasons why statistical measurement of events activity might be  
considered useful. First, data are required from which we can evaluate the signifi-  
cance of events to a particular location, whether that is a town, city or some other  
geographical region. In this respect data helps quantify the role that events play in  
the economy and in society. Second, data are essential to the planning of facilities  
and services. This has been shown in the construction of special sporting facilities,  
for example, but also for the development of tourism and other community facilities.  
Third, data collection is particularly needed by organisations and stakeholders in the  
events business, by government departments and by individual event organisers for  
the marketing and promotion of events, for the prediction of feasibility, demand and  
for statistical comparisons \(Yeoman et al., 2012\).  
There is a feeling that an expansion of events activity is taking place, and this is  
reflected in the increasingly rapid development of specialist events management com-  
panies and related service providers. There may be a number of reasons for this. In  
Europe, increased wealth \(and the associated benefits of disposable and discretionary  
income\) and many years of peace in the industrialised countries have strengthened  
the inclination to travel, to experience new ideas and to enjoy recreational activities.  
This, coupled with an active awareness of traditions, has seen an increase and in some  
cases a reinvention of many kinds of events, especially in the cultural field \(Beech  
et al., 2014\) \(such as opera at Glyndebourne and film at Deauville\). While this is true  
culturally, it is also true of the commercial, sporting and personal fields, for much the  
same reasons. As demand has grown, so too have the mechanisms to supply services  
to satisfy it, hence the reason for major international organisations and companies  
taking an interest in event activities. \(Cause and effect can be argued here\: is the  
increase in the number of organisations providing events services entirely due to  
demand, or has the potential demand been suppressed because of lack of available  
services?\) Nevertheless, many of these general demand factors are not apparent to the  
organisers of individual events, who are probably more interested in the individual  
motives of participants and visitors, to ensure their event is a success.  
Whereas demand for a routinely manufactured product is known and largely pre-  
dictable, demand for any given event is less easy to predict. This is partly an issue  
of participants’ motives to attend an event, but also because demand might be sup-  
pressed by factors not immediately obvious to organisers \(such as lack of disposable  
income for the target market group at a particular time of year\). This leads to some  
unpredictability. Latent demand may also be significant. For example, the demand  
expansion for Eurostar services through the Channel Tunnel significantly exceeded the  
expected demand, because it tapped latent \(hidden\) demand\: there were always going  
to be people who wanted to travel between Britain and mainland Europe with ease, in  
speed and in moderate comfort, without having to bother with a ferry crossing. This  
latent demand turned out to be very large indeed. Similar demand aspects may be at  
work in the events business – who knows how successful an event might be if demand  
is hidden or latent? This leads to the need for adequate market research, analysis and  
assessment as a tool in our understanding of how to promote and market events in  
the light of our knowledge about the market itself and its demand for events, or for a  
particular type of event or even a specific event \(Masterman and Wood, 2015\).

# Size and scope of the events market  
The events market is so diverse and fragmented that it is problematic to say what the  
business is worth as a whole in terms of the European Union. In fact, to attempt to  
quantify it may be a particularly difficult and pointless exercise. Although such a quan-  
tification might be seen as a challenge by some academics and researchers, the nature  
of the business and the limitations of data availability have to be appreciated. Imagine  
trying to accumulate data for attendance at carnivals in every single European town and  
city, that and in the knowledge that you can often only count ticketed numbers or direct  
participants\: you can’t really count people just watching your parade going past and  
waving happily at you, or wandering through your Christmas Market casually brows-  
ing. We might, maybe, make a ‘best guess’ and often research isn’t quite clear enough  
that some of their figures are estimates and what ‘estimate’ really means. Studies and  
reports do exist for certain countries and some event data are collected internationally.  
Examples of reports can be found on industry websites, such as the Business Visits  
and Event Partnership \(BVEP\), whose website provides a number of fairly recent ones.  
The student of events management would therefore be best advised to steer clear  
of this problem; indeed, even the serious researcher should not regard an assessment  
of the total value of the market to be a particularly viable exercise given the lim-  
itations of suitable and comparative frameworks. \(Although, as better quantitative  
information becomes available this position may change.\) How, then, can we seek to  
address the issue of the scope and scale of the events business? This can be done to  
some extent by breaking the business down into small components. We can then say  
that a certain part of the business is worth a given amount of money, has a certain  
number of participants or has a particular impact. We could take a geographical  
region and ask, ‘Can we quantify this type of event in this area?’ In some cases, this  
is possible. For example, the total wedding business in a country such as the UK is  
thought to be worth some €2.3 billion. This is based on the known number of wed-  
dings \(which are recorded officially\) and an estimate of the average cost of having a  
wedding. A similar kind of exercise could probably be done on a European scale, thus  
giving us a notional figure for the European wedding market. For some categories  
or types of events \(such as the European Grands Prix\) estimates have been made on  
a European scale. At a local level there are ‘toolkits’ available for event organisers  
to estimate the economic or social impact of their event \(Getz and Page, 2016\), such  
as that assessed by Jackson et al. \(2005\). Many event and arts organisations publish  
evaluation toolkits which you can view online; an example is the Arts Victoria web-  
site\: creative.vic.gov.au/ under community project evaluation.  
In building up a picture of event activity we are, in effect, ‘building a wall’. At pres-  
ent all we have are several bricks, from widely different sources, and not much by way  
of foundations. As the events industry is not typically seen as a homogenous whole,  
there has been no drive to seek common statistical information, either by the industry  
or by other users of statistical data, such as governments. In the range of events ­ activity,  
the nature of personal events, voluntary events and similar activities means that almost  
no data are collected for many kinds of events, except by occasional sampling, or per-  
haps by the event organisers for their own use or for a few household surveys. Even  
where events are organisational or commercial in nature, the extent of data collection  
is very limited indeed and often particular to that event alone. There is no common  
format even for the collection of attendance data, nor, in the foreseeable future, is there  
likely to be \(although some countries, such as Germany, do require certain types of

# Edinburgh, Scotland Fireworks at the Edinburgh Festival  
FACTBOX  
• 17 festivals a year in Edinburgh  
• Attendance ranges from 400 people to 1.5 million  
• The festivals attract over three million people to Edinburgh  
• Around €150 million generated by the festivals  
• Major local and regional impacts  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the way in which we can assess the economic impacts of  
an event with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which the economic impact was studied in the Edinburgh examples.  
• To highlight the way in which information was collected and used and so how this could be  
achieved for other events.  
• To understand what sources of information might be available for the collection of data.  
**A**n early study of the economic impact of the  
various festivals taking place in Edinburgh  
was undertaken by SQW Economic Development  
Consultants and TNS Travel and Tourism in 2005.  
The study provided a framework for studies of a  
similar type, though other models exist and a com-  
parison of four such models \(including the Edin-  
burgh study\) was undertaken by Alexandros Vrettos  
of the University of Maastricht in 2006. These types

in wider factors of interest and significance than  
just economics. By 2016, the Edinburgh Festivals  
Impact Study by BOP Consulting was covering 12  
of the component Edinburgh Festivals and was  
investigating issues as wide as audience numbers  
and environmental impact as well as the economic  
issues which such reports had first considered.  
The purpose of the original study was to identify  
the profile of visitors to the various festivals being  
held in Edinburgh throughout the year and to con-  
sider the economic impact in Edinburgh city, its  
region and Scotland in general. Data were collected  
from a survey of over 4,000 visitors by interview  
during the various festivals; further material was col-  
lected from a survey of performers and delegates,  
as well as a survey of hotels and guest houses. In  
addition, desk research was carried out, including  
work on previous economic impact surveys which  
had been carried out in some previous years. Impor-  
tantly, contact was also made with the organisers  
of the festivals to obtain details of spending and  
revenues.  
This approach highlights the potential of major  
surveys to enlighten us about the nature of events.  
However, major studies are intensive, costly and time  
consuming. In this case the funding for the study  
came from a number of bodies, including the City of  
Edinburgh Council, Scottish Enterprise, Event Scot-  
land and Visit Scotland. Very often our knowledge of  
the impact of events is limited by the immediate data  
available \(e.g. ticket sales and baseline revenue\) and  
by methodological limitations, because professional  
studies are expensive to conduct.  
In  
general terms, there is a need for a level of  
uniformity and comparability in the collection and  
collation of basic statistics for events, and a need  
for a common framework. This is a task for aca-  
demics and industry professional bodies and can  
be regarded as ‘a work in progress’.

attendance and other data to be collected for tourist-related festival activities\). This  
means that data collection relies predominantly on a few sources and most often on  
casual estimates. The accuracy of much event reporting tends to be limited, for a whole  
range of reasons, not least that accurate data are often collected only for admission  
paid events, and even then the likelihood of publication is small, since many organisa-  
tions record data mainly for their own internal use, if they record it at all.  
Looking at the problem positively, we can focus on individual events. A practi-  
tioner, researcher or student could make a fairly accurate analysis of the size and  
scope of an event, given time, effort and the cooperation of the organisers. More  
importantly, in terms of the market demand, once this focus on an event has been  
made, the market for the event can be analyzed too – we can say what kind of  
people are likely to attend or have attended in the past; something of their likely

• 283,000 events a year  
• Average €8,000 per event  
• Estimated €2.3 billion market

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the way in which a sector of the event market is estimated  
in terms of size and scope with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the nature, size and scope of the UK wedding market.  
• To develop an understanding of how the method might be used for other sectors.  
**T**he wedding market is one of a large number  
of discrete sectors of the events business, and  
is also one for which there is some assessment  
of size and extent. Many component parts of the  
events business cannot be quantified because of  
their *ad hoc* nature \(for example charity events,  
school sports days, private dinner parties, etc.\),  
and even where there may be potential to collate  
data about a particular sector of the market it may  
be difficult to disaggregate the size and extent  
of the business from other activities. Weddings,  
on the other hand, appear to attract a lot of atten-  
tion and many organisations make claims about  
the size of the wedding market based, in some  
cases, on very sketchy evidence \(or more or less  
no evidence\) indeed. In 2017 it was being claimed

€10 billion  
by some organisations that this market was worth  
but what was this claim based on and  
–  
was it realistic?  
Serious market research companies do under-  
take reports on the UK wedding market, as well as  
a large range of other industry and sector reports  
on anything from the size of the hotel market to the  
size of the lingerie market. In attempting to quan-  
tify the size and extent of the UK wedding market,  
Mintel observed that there is considerable regional,  
cultural and socioeconomic variation in what a  
wedding costs. Therefore, even though the national  
average cost of getting married is thought to be of  
the order of €8,000, this can vary from €5,000 to  
€20,000, depending on location and extent of the  
celebrations, and comprises a long list of items\:  
• engagement and wedding rings  
• engagement party, stag night, hen night, eve-  
ning wedding party, music, band  
• wedding dress, shoes, accessories and brides-  
maids’ outfits, groom’s outfit, going away outfit  
• bride’s bouquet, other flowers, posies and  
corsages  
• cars or carriages  
• registry, church or other venue fees  
• invitations and other stationery  
• photographs, video  
• reception venue or marquee  
• catering and drinks, wedding cake  
• first night hotel, honeymoon  
• various other expenses  
In terms of market demand, the UK wedding  
market has been gradually declining, with a fall in  
total number of events from about 400,000 a year  
in 1981 to 247,000 in 2015 \(Office for National Sta-  
tistics, 2017\), although the average cost of an event  
has been rising. Some expenditure, such as that on  
wedding gowns, doubled over a ten-year period  
to the extent that the average cost of a gown was  
thought to be almost €1,400. The decline, however,  
in overall demand suggests a change in the social  
determinants for getting married, insofar as marriage  
is becoming less popular, and that not only are UK  
couples getting married later in life, but many are  
happy not to be married at all. This reflects a change  
in the family and social structures of the UK, and in  
the underlying social determinant for being married.  
In comparison to many other types of event, the  
determinants for getting married are primarily social,  
although there are a range of secondary motives,  
such as the ability to have family and friends attend  
a major life event, and the opportunity, in the case  
of some types of wedding, to display wealth or sta-  
tus. This change has been somewhat reflected in  
alterations to English marriage law, whereby couples  
can now get married in a large number of licensed  
venues ranging from hotels to castles, whereas prior  
to 1996 the ceremony itself could only be carried out  
in a church or registry office. This change has also  
had some curious side-effects on elements of the  
wedding market and costs, not only in the changing  
pattern of ceremonial venues, but also in the per-  
ception of suitable clothing for weddings, which has  
tended to become less formal and more flamboyant.  
# Discussion Questions

type of event was it  
–  
formal or informal? Was  
there anything unusual about the event  
–  
such  
as special costumes or a historic venue?  
**2** How many people attended and what was their  
background\: were they family, friends, acquain-

–  
who  
was involved and why?  
**3** Is the market for weddings changing? Is it  
growing or contracting and why?  
**4** How are data collected for this type of event,  
and how do researchers and analysts use the  
information to produce reports and estimates of  
size and scope? Are some reports sketchy or  
even spurious  
–  
why is this?  
**5** How could this approach to gathering infor-

for your topic, e.g. weddings, this will bring up a list of published reports. Students should note that they can  
then search the source of the report they are interested in, but most market research reports are extremely  
expensive; you might only find a summary, not lots of information. However, sometimes press releases or

media habits and their motives for going to the event; and what benefits they get  
from attending or participating. These issues help our understanding of how events  
and festivals can be planned and marketed, and how market information should be  
recorded. There are five basic areas for continuous monitoring\:  
• visitor numbers  
• visitor spend  
• visitor activity and participation  
• advertising effectiveness  
• visitor satisfaction.  
On this basis, any assessment of the scope and scale of the events business could  
achieve its ends by looking at the component parts of the business. At an industry level,  
a note of caution is necessary\: we have financial assessments of only a few parts of the  
total market. The vast majority of elements of the events business have no available  
estimates of demand, income, expenditure or impact. Indeed, many types of events  
may never have realistic estimates, especially smaller voluntary events. If we, in our  
categorisation of special events, have included personal events as a key category, there  
is no way in which the amount of money that is spent on private informal gatherings,  
such as birthday parties, is ever going to be much more than reasonable estimates,  
nor for the sake of privacy should this be otherwise. The need for usable statistical  
data is a key one, however. This being so, event organisers and events management  
companies need to record more comprehensively the key indicators and publish them  
in the public domain, in order to raise the profile of the industry, assist the planning  
of facilities, services and training, and help focus marketing and promotional efforts.  
For an indication of the possibilities of estimating the market for the events business,  
consider the adaptation of the earlier typology of events in Figure 2.1; from this, read-  
ers may wish to insert their own event, or another event known to them, to see how  
the typology can be applied. The typology is, of course, incomplete, but is a means by  
which we can insert and apply other examples. The vast range of events not listed far  
exceeds the small number of events that are given as examples of their class. However,  
there is nothing to prevent an assessment of one event being made in terms of its worth,  
or of its market. There are even a number of classes of events that could have their  
worth, market size and market components realistically estimated. This approach, of  
taking one element \(and recognising it as part of a much greater whole\), may be a more  
useful means of gaining an impression of the scope of the events business.

# 33  
# Determinants and motivations  
Historically, the demand for events can be seen to have been determined largely by  
social factors. These included the need for social integration, interaction between  
individuals and communities, mutual support, bonding and the reinforcement of  
social norms and structures. In addition, there were issues of status, the need for  
public celebration and the development of religious, civic, trade and community  
rituals and ceremonies. We might ask why people attend events, and the answer may  
simply be that they want to enjoy themselves, celebrate, be happy, be sociable and  
do something they are interested in.  
Events continue to be driven by social and psychographic factors. Human soci-  
ety, whilst it may have developed technologically, still has the need for friendliness,  
interaction and community. In addition to these key social needs, events are also  
driven by economic, organisational, political, status, philanthropic and charitable  
needs. The development of events management companies and a larger and more  
cohesive service infrastructure for events is itself indicative of change in the forces  
that underpin demand for events activities. In examining the determinants for events,  
we can conclude that the creation of events is also driven by economic factors, an  
increasing standard of living, changing demographics and the improving education  
of the population.  
Within the European Union a high level of industrial development and general  
wealth ensure relatively high levels of disposable income, which is increasingly used  
towards hospitality, tourism and recreational activities, such as visiting or participat-  
ing in social and community events. Much the same is true of the commercial sphere  
of activity, and the demand for commercial events, such as conferences, exhibitions,  
product launches, and so on, continues to increase.  
In attempting to analyse the key drivers of demand for the events business we can  
perhaps conclude that for any given event there is a range of motives or determinants,  
and these motives can be said to be both primary and secondary \(see Figure 2.2\).  
For example, the primary motive for putting on a dinner party may be to entertain  
one’s friends, but there may be secondary motives, such as to increase one’s status by  
showing off a new house where the dinner party is to be held.  
The primary motive for holding an athletics competition may be to provide an  
opportunity for local athletes to measure their abilities against others; the secondary

motives may be to provide a social integrating mechanism for people with the same  
interests, and also, perhaps, to raise money to support an athletics club. We can see from  
these examples that there is unlikely to be one single motive for most types of event.  
There is a tendency to see the motivation for attending and participating in  
special events in terms of personal motivation. Motives for participation in events  
might perhaps be physical, social or personal, but might also be organisational,  
and this should not be overlooked \(see Figure 2.3\). In terms of the primary and  
­ secondary motives described above, the satisfaction of needs can vary considerably  
from event to event. The primary need for attending a dinner party might well be the  
maintenance of friendships, whereas the secondary motive might be to explore the  
possibility of making new acquaintances. The primary need for attending a motor  
show might have nothing to do with personal needs, but everything to do with the  
fact that the organisation you work for has sent you for organisational reasons. In  
this respect, the classic and often over-quoted theories of motivation, such as those  
by Maslow do not provide us with a real picture of why people go to events. Equally,  
in understanding why people attend or participate in events, a marketing approach  
that seeks only to satisfy one single need might not be enough to get people to the  
event, without there being some additional benefit or package of benefits.

Based on Bowdin *et al.*, 2011  
Participation in events may be a result of a wide range of potential motives, not  
just social ones. Personal expectations, tourism, support for other participants in the  
activity or the propensity to attend events as a form of relaxation or entertainment,  
may be reasons. In the case of those events for which an admission charge is made,  
the ability and willingness to pay the price is an issue, and secondary cost implica-  
tions may also impact on personal events. In the case of the dinner party, whether  
one’s friends attend is not simply a matter of the wish to interact with each other, it  
is also a question of their ability to do so, in terms of transport to get there, travel  
costs, distance, time and effort or whether some other personal priority \(like the need  
to look after the kids\) exists at the same time as the proposed date for the party.  
This does not mean to say that knowing the motives for attendance will necessarily  
help organisers in trying to discover how many people will actually attend an event.  
We might find that there is no useful market information whatsoever for an event we  
are planning, no studies, no collated data. This should not stop us searching for clues.  
What might be the total market size? What proportion of that total market is in our  
catchment area? Are there any clues from previous or similar events? Suppose our  
proposed event is industrial heritage based, for whom might industrial heritage be

of interest? How big is the market for it and what might the catchment be? Without  
research data on market size, we might look initially for other evidence, such as the  
circulation numbers of popular magazines on the subject \(these can be obtained from  
magazine marketing circulation information, sometimes printed in the magazine  
itself\), although this approach is still little more than guesswork. The same might  
be true of small events. Our ‘first ever’ village fête might only have a total potential  
market of the village population, say a village of 500 people, and not all of these  
will be there. In short, attendance estimates are just that – estimates. However, the  
process can, and should, be helped by a little market research\: take a sample of the  
target market and ask them if they are going to attend.  
At this point, however, social media may come to our aid. One of the most useful  
things about the evolution of social media in event marketing is that you may get  
an idea of attendance in advance of an event from the way people may be talking  
about it in their social media, whether that is Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or others.  
Quite simply, from the personal point of view, knowing that your friends might  
be attending an event is part of the decision-making process, although as an event  
manager or promoter we may have to consider how to influence decision leaders, in  
much the same way as we would have to for more traditional marketing methods;  
but beware – there is a difference between interest in an event and action to go to it.  
The range of motives can also impact on the attendance for those types of events,  
such as large-scale festivals, where more than one activity is taking place. In this  
respect it is highly likely that more than one market segment will be present with  
more than one motive for being there \(see Figure 2.4\).

the 1990s, especially around the Potsdamer Platz,  
where much of the festival activity goes on. The fes-  
tival is a major international cultural event for Berlin  
and attracts not only the movie-going public, but  
also large numbers of celebrities and journalists.  
A number of major film festivals have devel-  
oped over the past 80 years in Europe\: 1932 saw  
the first Esposizione d’Arte Cinematografica in  
Venice. Held on the terrace of the Hotel Excelsior  
alongside the Venice 18th International Art Exhi-  
bition, as a way of boosting tourism, it attracted  
some 25,000 people. Later, in 1935, it became  
an annual event. In the 1930s, Italy and Germany  
were linked in a political axis and the decision to  
split the Venice Golden Lion film prize for 1939  
between these two countries caused anger in  
France  
–  
which felt that its own film, La Grande  
Illusion, had lost out to political intrigue. Later  
that year, France responded by establishing the  
Festival International du Film in Cannes, although  
politics made a more dramatic intervention when  
the newcomer lasted just one day  
–  
the day of the  
outbreak of World War Two.  
In 1946, the Association Française d’Action  
Artistique organised the first full Cannes Film Fes-  
tival. Then, the festival was a tourist and social  
event, focused on the few hundred participants  
who attend a series of parties at hotels along  
the Croisette and in nearby villas, but as film fes-  
tivals matured, the commercial aspects began  
to become more explicit. In 1960, the informal  
Cannes Film Market, which had grown up along-  
side the Cannes Film Festival, became an official  
event; with ten participants \(film producers, buy-  
ers, etc.\) and one screen. By 2002 this part of the  
event alone attracted 7,368 participants, across  
29 cinemas.  
The Berlin International Film Festival \(the Ber-  
linale\) was established in 1951, at the Titania-Palast  
cinema, as part of an initiative to recapture the city’s  
former cultural significance. By 1955, the Interna-  
tional Association of Producers, which formally  
recognises film festivals, had officially elevated the  
Berlinale to a status paralleling that of the festivals  
in Cannes and Venice. In 1978, the Berlinale moved  
from summer to winter, enabling the expansion of  
its Film Fair, which became the European Film Mar-  
ket. In 1970 at the Berlinale, a screening of the film  
O.K. \(dealing with the war in Vietnam\) caused the  
jury’s resignation and the competition to be halted,  
prompting the establishment of the International  
Forum of New Cinema. In 1977, the Berlinale trans-  
ferred film history retrospectives to the Deutsche  
Kinemathek and inaugurated the Informationsschau  
section; the latter evolved into the Panorama. The  
following year, organisers added the Kinderfilmfest  
of children’s cinema and in 2002, the Perspektive  
Deutsches Kino section. The 50th Berlinale attracted  
390,000 professional and non-professional partici-  
pants, and 3,420 media representatives, from 70  
countries, reported the event.  
Festivals had to find ways to differentiate them-  
selves, or to respond to changes in festival-goer  
expectations. So, in 1947, the International Festival  
of Documentary Films was held at the Playhouse  
Cinema, Edinburgh, and in its over 50 years’ exis-  
tence it has evolved into the Edinburgh International  
Film Festival. In 1976, the first Festival Du Cinema  
Americain was held in Deauville, Normandy, devel-  
oping into a competition-based film festival. The  
Berlin Festival is a means of launching new films,  
made not only in Europe but also abroad, including  
the USA. The event is competitive insofar as a jury  
awards a range of prizes for film-making activities,  
which are known as Golden Bears \(the bear is the  
symbol and mascot of Berlin\). During the ten days  
of the year 2018 festival, some 240 films were  
shown, not only feature films, but also documen-  
taries and shorts. They included some well-known  
international films and many lesser known ones.  
Some attracted major audiences not only for the  
film itself, but also to see some of the stars who  
attended the festival, particularly where the launch  
of a new film was taking place. These major films  
and the presence of their stars can cause chaos,  
especially with the presence of international celeb-  
rities who attract intense attention from fans and  
journalists.

The Festival not only deals with the mainstream  
of film-making; there are fringe activities including the  
‘Panorama’ section, which gives advance previews of  
the next season’s films; the Kinderfilmfest \(children’s  
film festival\); the International Forum of Young Cin-  
ema and, separately, the European Film Market, for  
producers, distributors and other film professionals.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What kind of people would visit the film fes-  
tival? If visitors were classified into various  
categories of, say, film-goers; film-makers; the  
local public; film stars; film stars’ fans; poli-  
ticians, etc., what would be their respective  
motives for going to the festival, both in terms  
of their primary and secondary motives?  
**2** How should organisers seek to address the  
motivations of each category of visitor?  
**3** Identify a film festival in your region  
people go to it?  
–  
how many  
**4** How does the distinction between the core  
festival, ‘official’ peripheral events and non-official  
activities, impact on the festival itself?  
Do the motivations for attending the ‘fringe’  
\(the peripheral events\) and the motivations  
for attending the main festival differ \(does this  
also imply different groups or target markets  
are attending different parts of the event\)?

In the case of the model, it has been supposed that the event is composed of a  
number of activities, some of which are core activities and some of which might  
have ‘grown up around it’. This is often true of many kinds of events\: conferences,  
for example, may have associated exhibitions; carnivals may be composed of a large  
number of different activities linked by the carnival theme. Although an event may  
be a single activity \(such as an anniversary dinner\) with one homogenous group of  
people attending \(one market segment\), certain types of events comprise a range  
of activities, and these are attended by different groups or segments, possibly with  
different motives for being there.  
# The structure of demand for events  
In general, for the event organiser, an interest in the potential sources of demand is  
key to providing a successful event because without this knowledge it will be impossi-  
ble to provide what the target market expects \(Swarbrooke, 2011\). Indeed, the target  
market for the event, even if properly promoted, might or might not materialise. This  
is because, for a number of events, we are doing something new, and therefore the  
estimate of the potential market is just that – an estimate. On the other hand, there  
are events where the market is known and fixed, personal events being one example.  
Equally, there are events that, whilst retaining their uniqueness, recur at intervals,  
such as annually or biannually, and in this case the market is relatively well known  
from previous experience. If 5,000 people came to a town’s firework fiesta last year,  
and have done so for the past five years, then, assuming all other factors remain more  
or less the same, there can be a reasonable degree of certainty that 5,000 people will  
come this year. Here, though, is a limitation to the marketing theory that people will

come and buy your product or attend your special event provided you have done  
everything right – it might, for instance, rain on your firework fiesta. To take up a  
point made in Chapter 1, events are perishable. An event might well suffer from an  
unexpected external factor, the weather \(as with the Y-Not Festival in 2017 or British  
Grand Prix at Silverstone in 2000, when rain made access by car to the car parks,  
which had become muddy fields, impossible; since Silverstone had no public trans-  
port facilities worth mentioning, the event attendance was very nearly ruined\), the  
traffic or a clash with another event; all factors beyond the control of the organisers.  
In consequence, there may be all kinds of reasons why an event might not attract  
the numbers its organisers expect. People might not wish to come to the event at all.  
On the other hand, the assessment of the market for an event could be based simply  
on known ‘current’ demand. This kind of demand may only be part of the event’s  
potential. In terms of new events we may be tapping demand that has been latent  
or suppressed in some way. There are, in the sense of demand potentials, four kinds  
of demand\:  
• current  
• future  
• latent and  
• suppressed \(see Figure 2.5\).  
Figure 2.5 Demand potentials  
# 39  
Current demand  
–  
that demand which our event satisfies at the moment  
Future demand  
–  
that demand which our event could satisfy over a normal growth period  
Latent demand  
–  
that demand which is sleeping until you provide an event for it  
Suppressed demand  
–  
that demand which exists for our event but which cannot get to it due to being  
frustrated by price, time, availability, lack of disposable income or other reasons  
Suppose a town has a range of cultural and sporting events in its calendar. These  
events take place every year and will often attract different target market groups\:  
those who attend the regional football tournament might not be the same people who  
attend the annual early music festival. The market for events is therefore diverse and  
changing. Some events will also be more popular than others, some will be new that  
year, some may not, for a range of reasons \(from costs to popularity, or shortage of  
volunteer expertise\), run again next year. So the issue about running an event is not  
simply about the current market, it is also about whether the expertise, inclination,  
funding and support exists for an event to be planned and run. In the case of the  
North Sea Jazz Festival, the event began in 1975 with a small number of visitors, a  
few venues and fewer than 300 musicians. The level of demand was relatively small,  
but in each successive year the event has grown, and the level of demand to visit and  
participate in the event \(150,000 visitors and 1,200 musicians\) could not have been  
foreseen 25 years ago. At that time, demand for a jazz festival in this location was  
latent. Rather like building Eurotunnel between Britain and France, the effect was to  
create a new market and then expand on it. Equally, it is perfectly possible that there  
might be further potential and unexploited demand for the jazz festival which is not  
being tapped for a variety of reasons. This is true of many types of event.

FACTBOX  
• North Sea Jazz Festival  
–  
originally at The Hague, now in Rotterdam  
• Total participants and visitors\: 150,000  
• Number of musicians\: 1,200  
• Three-day festival in July  
• Predominant market\: jazz fans aged 35–55  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the North Sea Jazz Festival and its ‘fringe’ from the point  
of view of who attended and why, with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the target markets for this event  
–  
why there is more than one market and why do  
people attend?  
• To highlight the differences between the main festival and its ‘fringe’, that is, what may be the  
quite different groups of people attending.  
• To understand how broadly based a festival can become, beyond its original key and central  
purpose or theme.  
**T**here are a very large number of cultural  
and arts festivals held every year through-  
out Europe, ranging from folk festivals to poetry  
festivals, from highland dancing to classical music.  
Jazz is a major music medium, and there are per-  
haps some 300 major and minor jazz festivals and

events across Europe each year. These are held in  
all kinds of places, from major cities to small villages,  
and attract both jazz fans and the general public.  
There are well-known jazz festivals in Nice, France;  
Glasgow, Scotland; Cork, Ireland; San Sebastian,  
Spain; Aanekoski, Finland, to name only a few. One  
of the major European jazz festivals, however, was  
that held originally at The Hague in the Netherlands\:  
The North Sea Jazz Festival, this moved in 2005 to  
Rotterdam, having been at The Hague for 30 years.  
The festival attracts, directly, some 75,000 peo-  
ple. It is a three-day event held in July. The pro-  
gramme of jazz bands, groups and musicians is  
one of the major cultural events in the European  
calendar, and includes not only the main festival  
programme at the Ahoy Centre but also activities for  
children, supporting sales activities and exhibitions  
and an additional programme for the public in the  
city centre, called North Sea Around Town. This part  
of the festival is held in the afternoons and evenings  
until midnight, in the form of summer open-air con-  
certs in the city. This open-air programme attracts  
a further 75,000 people and adds much to the  
general atmosphere of celebration and relaxation.  
It also serves to bring jazz to a wider audience than  
just jazz fans. In 2010 the festival gained a younger  
sister, the Curacao North Sea Jazz Festival, which  
is held on the island of Curacao in the Caribbean.  
In total, the festival, in its 43rd year in 2018,  
reached almost 150,000 people. The programme,  
over its three days of events, concerts and open-air  
entertainment, is provided by almost 1,200 musi-  
cians. The target market for the event comprises  
people from all age groups, with the key age group  
for jazz fans being 35–55 years old. But the event  
also attracts people from all age groups\: families,  
tourists and people living in Rotterdam itself, from  
office workers to government ministers. Many of the  
visitors stay in the city’s hotels and guest houses, for  
which this is a peak period.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What might be the primary and secondary  
motives for a jazz fan attending this event or  
a family attending one of the summer evening  
open-air concerts?  
**2** What are the marketing benefits, to the main  
festival at the Ahoy, of having three days of  
free, evening open-air concerts in the city, for  
the public? What kinds of businesses in and  
around Rotterdam benefit from the festival?  
**3** Do these extra events help create demand for  
the main event?  
**4** How does social media impact on the demand  
for an event such as the North Sea Jazz Fes-  
tival, how does it assist with marketing, and  
what might be the effect on individual decision-making,  
for example, of finding that your friends  
are thinking of going to this event through, say,  
Facebook?

# Summary  
**I**n examining the scope and determinants of demand for events, we  
have concluded that due to the unusual and fragmentary nature of  
the events industry \(which may be said to include anything from private  
dinner parties to the Olympic Games\), an overall assessment of the  
market size of the business is a difficult process. It is preferable to look at  
individual events or groups of the same kinds of events, to assess their  
scope, impacts and extent; and although it is possible to make some  
estimates for certain sectors of the events business, this is not sufficient  
to provide a picture of the whole. People attend special events for a  
whole range of reasons; these may be social, organisational, physical or  
personal. In general, however, events are largely social occasions, and it  
is in this light that they should best be understood.

# Introduction  
The reader will have observed that we have, so far, tended not to refer to the events  
business as ‘an industry’. This is mainly because of the fragmented nature of the activ-  
ities that make up the huge breadth and range of this business. There is comparatively  
little explicit structure to it, unlike many industries which perceive themselves as a  
cohesive whole, for example, banking or retail. There is no one single major supply  
element to events, although there are some representative bodies, and some under-  
standing that events are a major economic activity, however difficult to quantify.  
In contrast to many industries, the events sector is not wholly driven by the need  
to make money. Indeed, the sector has a very large element of personal, volun-  
tary, charitable and philanthropic activity in addition to what might be considered  
conventional business aspects and commercial activity. The broad range of events  
allows all kinds of organisations and individuals to participate in an enjoyable  
way for the mutual benefit of all concerned. The social benefits of this approach  
are very considerable, not only in terms of social integration and the contribution  
that people can make to their community, but also in terms of friendship and good  
neighbourliness.  
This is not to say that a large commercial sector does not exist; it has developed  
rapidly during the last 20 years and will continue to do so. The market for events has  
also expanded to the point where the need for a much greater professional input is  
evident. The increasing number of events management companies and professional  
events organisers is an indication of this. Events management did not, however,  
suddenly appear out of nowhere. These businesses have long existed as part of the  
tourism and hospitality industries, but events management as a stand-alone segment  
is now seen as commonplace.  
As the events sector has developed, the levels of specialisation and technical  
requirements have increased, due to greater expectations on the part of organisers  
and participants, and this has led to a rapid development at venues in event-related  
services and support organisations \(Hassanien and Dale, 2011\). While it is still the  
case that a small personal event, such as an anniversary, may be a comparatively  
simple affair, with little need of organisational or technical support, larger activities,  
**VIP** events, launches, **corporate hospitality** activities, competitions or large sporting  
or recreational events often require a great deal of support from conception onwards  
\(Masterman, 2014\). The extent of these services may initially be rather surprising,  
but think of all the activities that are involved in a carnival and the potential for  
complexity in the support of the larger events sector becomes more evident.

# Associations and professional bodies  
A developing support infrastructure exists, which takes in European Union and  
national government departments responsible for tourism \(or sport, culture or the  
arts, depending on the type of event\)\: for example, the Tourism Division of the  
­ British Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; the Ministerio de Industria,  
Energía y Turismo \(the Spanish government Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tour-  
ism\) and similar government departments exist throughout Europe. This structure  
also includes national \(and regional\) tourist organisations \(NTOs\) responsible for

developing and marketing tourism, event and **convention** activities\: for example,  
the British Tourist Authority \(BTA\), known as ‘Visit Britain’; the Netherlands Board  
of Tourism and Conventions \(NBTC\) and similar national authorities, who collate  
information on events and promote and support some of them. National trade associ-  
ations and industry professional bodies are part of this infrastructure\: the Association  
of Events Organisers \(AEO\), European Cities Marketing \(ECM\) and the Interna-  
tional Festivals and Events Association \(IFEA Europe\) are examples; indeed there are  
the best part of 40 industry-related associations in the UK alone and there are prob-  
ably several hundred such bodies throughout Europe. In addition regional or local  
tourist offices and visitor and convention bureaux play a role. Examples are Visit  
Birmingham and the Birmingham Convention Bureau; the Scottish Tourist Board,  
or the Dutch VVV \(Vereniging voor ­ Vreemdelingenverkeer\), and local or regional  
tourist information offices in most European towns and ­ cities. Finally, educational  
institutions, including colleges and universities ­ teaching events ­ management, can be  
regarded as part of this developing infrastructure \(see Figure 3.1\).  
In many cases, especially with professional bodies, and with events education, these  
are still at a fairly early stage of development, largely because of the current rather  
fragmented nature of the events sector, but the provision is expanding and maturing  
quite quickly. Indeed, as the sector matures, it is likely that infrastructure organi-  
sations will play a greater role \(especially where there may be a public agenda for  
social inclusion or tourism, sport or cultural development activities\), and clearly, at  
the moment, some types of organisations are better developed in some countries than  
others. Bowdin et al. \(2012\) note the range of associations within the events business  
is actually quite large, but rather unconsolidated in comparison to other industries.

# orGAnisations  
The events sector is not solely concerned with the provision of activities, entertain-  
ment, refreshment and **logistics**; it also encompasses a wider range of interlinked  
services and goods. The larger and more elaborate an event becomes, the greater the  
need for increased technical and logistical support of one kind or another. With an  
increasing complexity of needs and demands, the standard of organisation required  
for large-scale events is very high and a whole series of specialist activities has grown  
up to service these needs. Although many of the organisations in production, distri-  
bution, venue and ancillary services might be thought of as private sector, this is not  
entirely the case, as the quadrant diagram \(Figure 3.2\) shows.  
These organisations typically either package services and provide the whole thing  
or provide one element of the service needed by an event organiser or organising

committee \(who may wish to do the rest for themselves\). The types of organisations  
capable of providing complete packages for events are normally\:  
• event management companies  
• production companies  
• event catering companies  
• party planners and professional events organisers.  
A wide range of companies provide other services which can be hired in, con-  
tracted or purchased \(depending on the service\). These cover directly related ser-  
vices such as the provision of hospitality, or indirect services that exist not only  
to provide something for the events business, but also perform a function for the  
local community. For example, transport and guiding services, whose role is to get  
participants and audiences from the point of arrival to, and sometimes around,  
a venue; Then there are various other services such as retailing, medical support,  
administration, secretarial and travel. It can be seen from this approach that a  
matrix of distribution activities already exists in the events business \(see Figure 3.3\).  
There is a range of distribution channels, as found in many industries. For example,  
when buying a holiday, the purchaser may go to a travel agent, who might provide  
a whole package holiday \(in the same way that an event management company can  
provide a whole event package\). Alternatively, the purchaser could put together a  
holiday from various component parts, such as a flight and a hotel, having chosen  
the destinations using information from the internet \(thus, in the same way, a client  
wanting an event could do it themselves by assembling the various parts, a venue,  
a caterer, an entertainer, and so on\). The distribution channels are therefore the  
mechanism by which venues, markets and events activities are put together. The  
choice of channel depends on the experiences and expectations of the buyer, and  
by influences such as marketing and public relations that the various companies or  
other sellers can exert.

organisation whose purpose is to promote Holland  
to visitors both domestically and internationally. It is  
especially concerned with the marketing of Holland  
for tourism and events.  
The NBTC head office is in The Hague with fur-  
ther offices in its worldwide network including those  
in Belgium, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Britain,  
Sweden, China, Japan and the United States. The  
NBTC has some 150 staff and its funding for 2013  
\(for example\) amounted to €26.3 million, part of  
which \(€8.3 million by 2015\) was grant aided for  
promoting incoming tourism \(Source\: OECD 2016\).  
NBTC is the leading destination marketing  
organisation for the promotion of leisure and busi-  
ness travel to and within Holland. Its marketing  
strategy, contained in a Strategic Marketing Plan,  
identifies the target markets which it is seeking  
to develop by a mechanism known as Product  
Market Partner Combinations and these include  
leisure markets such as ‘Holland Country Fun’ or  
‘Holland City’ and business markets such as ‘Hol-  
land – Be Inspired’. Each year the NBTC promotes  
a theme or international event, whose purpose is  
to create greater awareness of the Holland ‘brand’  
and to generate positive public relations and press  
coverage.  
# Further Reading  
The international event for 2018 was Leeuwar-  
den – Friesland Capital of Culture, in which the city  
and district took part in a large-scale art, sport and  
cultural festival and year-long event starting on the  
26th and 27th of January. This major event included  
a whole range of composite parts, stretching from  
small community events in the city, towns and vil-  
lages telling stories of their history, to big sport and  
music events such as the European Sports for all  
Games, the Oerol Festival and the Northern Film  
Festival. The main programme contained over 60  
principal events supported by many organisations  
and communities.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Identify one or more infrastructure organisa-  
tion\(s\) with an interest in the events business,  
see what they do and find out why?  
**2** Why does the Dutch Ministry of Economic  
Affairs support the promotion of tourism and  
events and what benefits do these bring nation-  
ally to a country?  
**3** What other national or major public sector organ-  
isations may be involved in events and why?

The use of these various organisations is a matter not only of budget, but also of  
the experience \(or lack of it\) on the part of buyers, of the standard to be achieved at  
a given event, of the time available to make arrangements and of the requirements  
of the organisation making the booking and completing the planning process. Needs  
and, therefore, the approach, vary.  
# EMCs  
Event ­ Management  
Company.  
# Event management companies  
Event Management Companies \(**EMCs**\) are a quite recent innovation \(but there  
are historical precedents\) and these have often grown out of related service or  
hospitality providers, which have specialised in providing the complete event \(Ali  
et al., 2017\).

Events, as we have noted, may range from product launches and dinner dances  
to themed gala evenings or charity sports competitions. EMCs tend to be involved  
where the organisers have a requirement for major or VIP events, or corporate  
hospitality or where, for example, a product launch demands specialist design and  
innovation. The benefit of having an EMC is the range of expertise, ideas and expe-  
rience they can draw on. Taking the case of a gala evening, such as a themed dinner,  
the events management company should be capable of providing the expertise for  
almost any theme the organiser may choose. This will include the planning, menu  
and theme design; in terms of identifying a suitable menu to go with the theme, as  
well as full catering support in food production and service at the event. Develop-  
ment of a theme might include specialist sets, props, costumes for participants, and  
all the range of support requirements from special effects and lighting, to music and  
entertainment.  
The creation of special events of this type is highly complex and, above all,  
requires extremely careful planning and costing. The choice of the theme itself should  
be a matter of careful discussion between the events management company and the  
buyer or client. A great deal depends on the objectives, the venue, the nature of the  
facilities \(such as kitchens and even wash-up areas\), the size of the venue, its design  
features, and elements such as the availability of licensing, parking, loading, power  
and access. However, all these things are within the expertise of an EMC to arrange  
and sort out, so that a client does not have to do the hard work of organising an  
event themselves, but simply employs the EMC, gives them a **brief** and lets them get  
on with it.  
# 51  
# brief  
A document or  
specification pre-  
pared by a client  
that states the  
requirements for  
an event, which is  
used either as the  
basis for an EMC  
or PEO to tender  
for, or as a basis  
for the design of  
the event itself, or  
both.  
# Production companies  
Organisers are often confronted by unique problems when seeking to create an  
event of a professional standard. This is particularly the case for high-profile-  
events. The ability to develop such events may be beyond the knowledge of the  
average organiser who may have been delegated to do the job within a committee  
or a voluntary organisation. Nevertheless, high profile events, VIP ceremonies,  
**roadshows**, major competitions or product launches all require specialist technical  
facilities and knowledge. Increasingly, events of this kind are put into the hands  
of production companies. These companies are able to package together the wide  
range of technical support that high-profile activities often require to put on the  
production.  
A production company will probably be able to undertake most, or all, of the  
following activities\:  
**1** The production itself, for the event, its budget, scheduling, scripting and any  
post-production-activities.  
# 2  
Design, including set and backdrop design, staging, lighting and all the range  
of audio-visual support needed for high quality productions and events.  
**3** Venue management, where an organisation may, for example, wish to take  
over a unique or unusual venue to use for its event and which therefore  
requires expertise to be brought in that the venue itself might not normally  
possess.

**5** Supply of talent, staff and similar human resources, perhaps also present-  
ers and speakers as well as crew, that is to say the organisation of staff and  
support.  
Naturally, the packaging of the whole production process does not come cheaply,  
but production companies have a level of expertise and contacts within the sector  
that most ordinary organisers may not possess, so that whilst it might be possible for  
an organiser to put together a highly complex upmarket event, the organiser would  
have to be both well trained and extremely experienced to do so. Given that few  
organisations, especially volunteer ones, possess experienced organisers, it is often  
necessary to bring in production companies for high profile events.  
# Events catering companies  
One of the most important inputs to the events business is probably the need for  
catering. This covers all aspects of refreshment for participants, audiences, crew and  
staff. Catering can be provided in three main ways\: it is undertaken either  
• in-house \(i.e. by an organiser or venue\), or  
• by contractors permanently employed at the venue, or, alternatively  
• on an ad hoc basis at the venue\: some venues might not be able to provide  
­ specialist catering for an event.  
For example, for a village fair, the village hall might have a kitchen but no caterer  
to run it so a contractor or local food provider may have to be found. For outdoor  
events it is very common for concessions to be given which might take the form of  
a pitch or allocated space for a privately provided food truck or mobile kiosk \(‘the  
burger van’\). There are different methods of providing these, so they might be hired  
per day or a fixed fee charged for the pitch. For these situations the catering or con-  
cession arrangements will have to be determined well in advance.  
Catering operators range in size and in the types of service they provide. EMCs  
were earlier mentioned as sometimes having developed from catering operators.  
The larger contract catering companies also run the in-house services of a number  
of venues and ad hoc provision for conferences, exhibition and other events includ-  
ing corporate hospitality. Independent caterers also have a share of the smaller  
conference and meeting market. In the price-restricted part of the market, such  
as for charitable events, there are small independent caterers who provide basic,  
but sound, catering in the form of buffets. This type of catering for small events  
may be unserviced, that is to say the food/drink is delivered with disposable plates  
etc., and the organiser simply lays it out for participants or guests to eat. Bakeries  
often provide this kind of unserviced buffet, simply delivered and paid for on the  
spot and perfectly adequate for the job. A similar service is sometimes provided by  
supermarket companies.  
Many major hospitality or catering companies have divisions dealing with events  
catering, sometimes, perhaps wrongly, known as ‘Outside Catering’. Events catering  
companies range in size from small family businesses, which look after things such

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the activities of an events management company  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the advantages and disadvantages of using an EMC.  
• To determine why a given event or event organiser would wish to use an EMC.  
• To understand that not all events are suited to a single type of organisation.  
**A** s organisations have begun to concentrate  
on their core activities, they may not have the  
staff to do their own event organising and there-  
fore need an external event organiser, company  
or agency to do it for them. The task of putting  
together often complex event activities is taken on  
by the EMC, which has the necessary expertise and  
time to achieve a better result. Sometimes this can  
be via a single professional event organiser, or a  
company or agency can provide the total package  
of event organisation.  
Coeva is a small Paris-based commercial events  
management organisation run by partners Cyril  
Megret and Julien Potier. Coeva deals with events  
management activities by coordinating collabora-  
tors, sub-contractors, artists and other assisting

organisations and people, and thus operates a net-  
work of the support services which may be involved  
in any one event. This method of organisation can  
be compared with large single company organisa-  
tions which might undertake all aspects of an event  
within the company itself.  
Effectively, Coeva is a professional services  
organisation with extensive local knowledge, exper-  
tise and a network of resources to draw on. The  
background of the partners is in marketing, commu-  
nications and the art and design world. Coeva there-  
fore specialises in the design and implementation  
of events, tours and related logistics, so can also  
operate as a Destination Management Company,  
providing support for a client’s event at any given  
location within France, this part of the Coeva opera-  
tion being the ‘France&only’ brand. Typically, Coeva  
is able to provide events management services for  
a fairly typical range of events from gala dinners to  
**trade shows**, and from award ceremonies to prod-  
uct launches for different clients of all kinds.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What are the advantages and disadvantages  
of an organisation using an Event Manage-  
ment Company?  
**2** As an event organiser, what choices do you  
have to organise your event – who else could  
you go to besides either doing it yourself or get-  
ting an EMC to do it?  
**3** List ten events of different types. Which, if any  
of these events might benefit from the use  
of an EMC and why? Is the use of an EMC  
appropriate \(or not\) to all kinds of events?  
What other kinds of event organisations  
exist?

# trade shows  
A gathering  
for a trade or  
competitive exhi-  
bition, often with  
accompanying  
social events, a  
conference or  
workshops and  
entertainment,  
which is probably  
not open to the  
general public.  
as local weddings or village fêtes, up to major international caterers which hold  
contracts for significant large-scale events such as international air shows and sports  
tournaments, major ‘society’ weddings, VIP dinners, major corporate hospitality, and  
so on. Consider the complexity and size of the catering provision for the Munich  
Oktoberfest, the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Tournament, the Paris Air Show or the  
Olympics, and it can be seen that this is a very large business indeed.  
An organiser may choose any one of the above ‘packaging’ organisations depend-  
ing on the requirements of each particular event\: what are the event’s objectives?  
Who are the participants? How large will the event be? How complicated will the  
catering provision need to be? In some cases, it might even be conceivable that all  
three types of company are needed together, but this is not very common and one  
will probably have to be the ‘lead’ organisation.  
# Party planners and professional events organisers  
Although major companies, like those above, are common in the events business,  
so too are a wide range of smaller organisations and individuals willing to provide  
events-related services. The most common of these are probably party planners and  
professional events organisers. The first tend to offer a range of services particularly  
for the personal events market, the second, for the corporate market. This would

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. Commercial event and event support organisations  
include the organisation of parties, celebrations, weddings, anniversaries and many  
other similar events. While many people are happy to organise their own events on  
a small and more intimate scale, not all have the time or wish to expend the effort  
on doing so, and are happier to pay a professional to come along and deal with all  
the nitty-gritty detail of planning, organising, operating and managing an event so  
that everything goes smoothly. Professional party planners or events organisers are  
obviously more used to doing this than is the average person, who might only have  
to put on a biggish event occasionally and might otherwise have to rely on friends  
and family to help.  
# 55  
# Event promoters  
There is a well-established group of individuals and companies involved in music,  
concert and sport event promotion. Promoters can work for individuals, a company  
or a particular venue and their role is to contract artists, entertainers or groups either  
for a single concert, **gig** or event or for a tour. This involves having to identify the ven-  
ues, book dates, deal with the contracting arrangements, market the event in terms  
of advertising and ticketing, and make the necessary licensing, staging, equipment  
and support arrangements. Most commercial promoters are taking a risk; that is to  
say they may guarantee an artist or group a fee to perform, they sell the tickets and  
then they take a share of the profit or have to deal with the loss. It is the promoter  
who is contractually liable to ensure the various activities take place and therefore  
they are also involved in negotiating contracts, advising on legal matters, liaising  
with designers and printers and dealing with administrative issues such as financial  
control and record keeping.  
# gig  
A concert of rock,  
pop, house or  
other popular  
musical style.  
# Exhibition and theatrical contractors  
Exhibition \(and some theatrical\) contractors are a surprisingly mature part of the  
industry and have existed for many years. Their function is to provide exhibition \(or  
backdrop\) services of one kind or another, ranging from design and management for  
large exhibition-type events to the provision of relatively simple one-off stands. Some  
venues in the field are able to provide in-house services, but may rely on exhibition  
contractors to create and supply complete shell schemes for exhibitions. Given that  
some parts of the events market \(manufacturing companies, for example\) have a long  
history of organising combined launch and exhibition events, a number of exhibition  
contractors also have expertise in events production. However, some specialise and  
act as suppliers of systems, either for hire or for purchase. Typically, contractors will  
provide the shells \(exhibition booths\) in a venue and individual exhibitors will fill a  
shell with their own material, displays and staff for the duration of the exhibition or  
show. The contractor will then come in and break down the shells and clear the area.  
# Technical services and multimedia support  
In addition to catering, technical services may be brought in. Not all venues have  
the technical support or equipment to cope with the full range of services sometimes  
demanded by organisers. Indeed, the small hotel, marquee or village hall used by

parts of the market may have no facilities at all beyond the space and the furniture.  
Equipment and technical support can be hired in from a range of companies, some  
of whom simply provide equipment, some of whom provide not only equipment, but  
also training and technical support. Presentation equipment can be hired in, ranging  
from basic projectors and sound systems to anything high-tech. Print shops are capable  
of copying for guest packs, tickets, handouts and support material such as badges or  
place cards. Video production companies are also common and are used for recording  
the proceedings themselves, and often have their own recording, sound editing and  
production facilities. The range of technical facilities provided by the companies in  
this field is extremely wide and reflects the importance that organisers, particularly of  
high profile and VIP events, attach to the need for technical facilities, whether this is  
data or video projection, voice or prompting systems \(autocues\), or any other of a wide  
range of technology to support a presentation, a ceremony or commentary at an event.  
# workshops  
A small gathering  
of people to  
discuss a specific  
topic, exchange  
ideas or solve  
a particular  
problem.  
# Voluntary bodies and charities  
It must not be overlooked that many events are organised by voluntary bodies,  
such as committees, or individuals \(either amateur or professional\). Voluntary bod-  
ies often organise entire events based on voluntary help, or a mixture of voluntary  
help, support from local authorities and other organisations, or with partial use of  
commercial organisations in some roles. Essentially, personal events such as dinner  
parties follow this ‘voluntary’ framework – you do it yourself or receive help from  
friends and family to do it and perhaps you buy in food from a caterer. Another type  
of organisation is the voluntary organisation supported by the public sector, as noted  
earlier – a town carnival might be organised by a voluntary committee, but it also  
might be helped by the local council’s events or tourism department \(or a combina-  
tion of these\). Special events organisations should not be seen simply as the province  
of commercial companies or individuals – these are only part of the whole.  
A particularly important category of events often run on a voluntary basis are  
those undertaken by charities. These can range from activities such as fun runs,  
money-raising dinners, sponsored events \(anything from charity skydives to spon-  
sored bike rides\), gift auctions, and so on, to organisational support events such as  
conferences, skills development days, **workshops** and team training for the charity’s  
own volunteers. Charitable events are very wide ranging\: money may be needed not  
just to fund the core charitable activity, but to support the operation of the charity  
itself such as for\:  
• the recruitment of volunteers  
• the provision of funding to make bids for grant aid or sponsorship  
• the payment of expenses or  
• providing a small permanent secretariat.  
In many cases the charity concerned may well organise these within their own  
resources\: charities often have their own fundraising officers, but in some cases grant-  
aid may support the provision of a professional event organiser for an ambitious  
event the charity wishes to put on. In a very few cases, a major fundraising event or  
activity at national or regional level may involve employing an Event Management  
Company, but this is rare, because to do this would mean funding the EMC from  
within the charitable donations being sought in the first place or from within the

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine a voluntary and charitable fundraising activity associated with  
a major event with the following objectives\:  
• To consider how the charitable funds have been raised in this example.  
• To highlight why the method has been a success.  
• To examine whether it is suitable as a concept for other types of voluntary or charitable organisations.  
**T**he Lausanne Marathon was first run in 1993  
and will have held its 25th edition in 2018. It is  
run in October in the Swiss city of Lausanne, with  
a principal course which follows the shore of Lake  
Geneva and the countryside and small villages from  
the Place de Milan in Lausanne to the town of Vevey,  
east along the lake shore and return. There is an app  
which features live tracking of the runners \(without  
using their phones\) and includes interactive maps  
and social media integration. The marathon typically  
attracts some 10,500 participants from all around the  
world. In many respects the Lausanne Marathon isn’t

about the toughness of its run, it is one of the mech-  
anisms by which Lausanne seeks to attract visitors  
and families to enjoy the city and its scenery. The  
marathon and the other runs and walks are conse-  
quently popular with a wide range of people over the  
main days on which the event takes place, attracting  
some 25,000 supporters, tourists and visitors.  
The fundraising method is one based on quite tra-  
ditional methods of sponsorship for both individuals  
and groups. The marathon’s webpage allows people  
to make donations and to start their own fundraising  
pages. What is relatively recent is the method for  
crowdfunding using social media and sites such as  
Just Giving. In the past much individual fundraising  
depended on the support of friends and family or  
attracting the attention of your local media \(e.g. local  
newspaper or local radio\) to get people’s attention  
to support you, sponsor you and make donations.  
In the case of the Lausanne Marathon the bulk of  
the charitable fundraising effort is devoted to giving  
money to charities associated with cystic fibrosis  
and other illnesses. In addition, a subsidiary activity  
is ‘Texaid’, which is a charitable mechanism for recy-  
cling old clothes and textiles thus raising money for  
further charitable activities.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** How were the charitable funds raised in this  
example and why has the method been a  
success?  
**2** Could this success be replicated in all cases, or  
should voluntary and charitable organisations  
consider other methods of fundraising? If so,  
why might other methods be better?  
**3** The Lausanne Marathon is an example of a vol-  
untary project to fundraise; could this type of  
fundraising be organised in other ways, such as  
by an Event Management Company?

charity’s perhaps limited sources of revenue. It is much more common for charities  
to operate with volunteers than do commercial or private sector organisations.  
Event management is one of those activities in which there is a large and active  
voluntary input. Many events, ranging from charity functions to village sports days,  
from birthday parties to local traditional events, are undertaken by volunteers. This  
might be family or friends, or a hobby or recreational club. It might be a small  
committee set up for the purpose of running the event – anything from an annual  
rose-growing competition to the recreation of a historic battle in full costume. These  
types of organisation are often overlooked in studies of events activity, as there is  
a tendency to look at larger-scale commercial professional events as the model for  
events management. To take such a restricted view would be wrong, and would  
ignore the long social history of events, festivals and traditional folklore activities.  
A typical voluntary committee might be made up of six or so people interested in  
putting on a particular event. This group might be already elected to perform some  
task in running a voluntary society, a hobby or recreational club, or might be formed  
specially to do the job. The effectiveness of voluntary bodies is often very high, due  
to the commitment, work and effort that the volunteers are willing to put into the  
activity, and also because of the lengths to which they might go to obtain resources,  
help, facilities and services for their event.

It is also the case that, for larger or more important events, these might be planned  
and managed through cooperation between volunteers and professionals. An event  
might be volunteer-managed, through an executive committee, but employ a pro-  
fessional events organiser to plan and run the event. On the other hand, a profes-  
sionally managed event might still need to use volunteers as staff, but might also  
need to coordinate the activities of a range of voluntary bodies to produce an event  
such as at a carnival \(where the professional organisers might be the city council  
tourism department, coordinating the efforts of everyone from the city band to the  
local majorettes\). The organisation structure may therefore vary from event to event  
depending on factors as diverse as the objectives of the event or the resources \(in  
terms of staffing and management, for example\) available to run it. \(Goldblatt, 2011\)

# Summary  
**T** he events sector has seen the increasing development of commer-  
cial companies with specialist roles in management, production and  
hospitality. Some of these companies, such as exhibition contractors,  
have been around for many years; some, such as production companies  
and events management companies, are relatively recent. The govern-  
mental infrastructure of the events sector is also becoming more evident,  
with an expansion of interest from tourist authorities and government  
departments, and an increasing number of trade and professional bodies.  
The breadth of the events sector is such that there is also a very consider-  
able voluntary element, organising anything from small personal events to  
local shows and sporting competitions. The size of this voluntary element  
is difficult to judge, but it is as much a key component of events activities  
as the developing commercial and public or governmental infrastructure  
elements.

# Introduction  
It would be very easy for us to see special events purely in a social context. In the  
past, many events were mainly personal and private affairs and the implications of  
having a special event in a community were largely social. An event such as a village  
wedding was both a cause for celebration and a means by which the whole village  
could interact together. Indeed, events of this type often involved the whole commu-  
nity in some way, in addition to the immediate families of the couple to be married.  
There were often local rituals to be undertaken; these varied from place to place and  
were part of the social fabric and history of the area. Such rituals, now often long  
forgotten, served to reinforce community ties and to make events different in many  
small ways from those of their neighbours. Local village events, for example, were  
sometimes much rowdier and more spontaneous than today \(e.g. May Day\), but  
many of these local traditions faded away during the Victorian era as the nature of  
society changed, to be replaced by a rather more constrained way of doing things.  
The reason for this loss was the rather fossilised nature of Victorian society and a  
tendency in our modern world to regard spontaneity as odd or out of place; as such,  
we had forgotten many of the traditions and differences that characterised our com-  
munities until the 1840s. However, the social context is only one element of events  
and there are many other implications \(Figure 4.1\).

We may regard events only in one particular way, but if we are to take the events  
business as a whole, it operates within an environment of constant change, and a  
number of methods of gauging or assessing this exist. We will examine the context  
in terms of examining the social, economic, political and developmental factors of  
the world in which events operate. There are, however, other methods, and we note  
some of them. A tool used commonly in management and marketing fields is the  
PEST analysis, which is a mechanism for assessing the market in which a business as  
a whole operates. Other techniques can be used, such as SWOT analysis, which is a  
mechanism for assessing how a business unit, an idea or a proposal for a new product  
\(or event\) would operate, or to judge whether it would succeed or not. Insofar as  
we are looking at events in context in this chapter, we have tended to use the PEST  
approach, as it can be taken in its component parts to show how different events  
may have different or mixed implications.

The main components of PEST analysis are Political, Economic, Social and Tech-  
nological issues and implications. To these can be added a number of other compo-  
nents, and these vary depending on the nature of the assessment being carried out.  
For example, if this were a financial assessment, then a Finance component could be  
added; if this were an assessment of Industrial change, then an Industry component  
could be added. However, we are tending to approach our assessment within a frame-  
work of looking at the implications of events within their operating or marketing  
context, and so we could use the PESTELI approach, which assesses events or the  
events business in terms of Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental,  
Legal and International issues and implications. But bear in mind, importantly, that  
this approach does not work for everything. Small events \(which form the very basis  
of the business and the vast majority of activities\) simply do not require this level of  
consideration. Nor do most small events organisations or individual organisers have  
the time or inclination to undertake complicated assessment, they would be perfectly  
happy with their own instinct about their own local area, its needs and issues. Only  
when we are considering major events AND have sufficient management expertise  
available can managerial assessment techniques be used.  
Returning then from the dizzy heights of management assessment, we can return  
to smaller scale issues. Local events, for example, are frequently seen in terms of the  
community, and event managers often go to some lengths to involve the local com-  
munity. Social integration is not the only outcome of many modern events, because  
as the size and complexity of events have increased \(especially in organisational and  
sporting events\), so have the potential impacts on the economic and political life of  
the area, or community, whether that is a town, city or region. For example, tourist  
towns and resorts have long understood the benefits of running special events during  
the tourist season, perhaps to bring more people to the town \(and thus encourage  
further spending in local shops and businesses\) or to extend the season in some way.  
The Blackpool Illuminations, that great triumph of light and colour, with its sev-  
eral kilometres of lights, displays, tableaux and illuminated trams, were intended to  
extend the tourist season. In this it has very much succeeded, and the event attracts a  
huge number of people from all over the North of England and Scotland every year,  
giving the resort’s economy a very significant boost.  
Looking again at major events, some of these especially national or international  
sporting events play a political role in addition to the social and economic roles, and  
this may impact the bidding process \(Foley et al., 2012\). The Olympics are a prime  
example of this. There is considerable international competition to stage the games;  
on the one hand because of their perceived economic and developmental benefits,  
but on the other because there are also positive political impacts, such as improving  
the international image of a country or, in the case of some types of event, as a means  
of gaining other political benefits such as kudos or public exposure. For this reason,  
politicians often attach themselves to high profile activities such as the Oscars or  
award ceremonies, as they gain from the reflected glory of the winners of such events.  
# Social and community implications  
Human society is complex and interactive, and all human societies celebrate, whether  
they are modern and technological or old and traditional. The means of celebration  
is very diverse. Sometimes special events are spontaneous – your friends at work  
find out it’s your birthday, and almost straightaway they’ve got you a card, found

a cake \(even if it’s just a muffin with a candle\), and opened a bottle of wine \(which,  
being alcohol, is banned from the premises by the tedious management, but hidden  
by the wise staff\). These events serve to strengthen social bonds as well as to spread  
enjoyment around. Many events are less spontaneous and more carefully planned,  
but those events whose progress is frequently planned down to the last detail, such  
as weddings, have significant social implications \(Bowdin et al., 2012\). They have  
an impact on participants’ emotional and intellectual outlook, in terms of pleasure,  
social interaction, stimulation of the mind and the senses – ranging from the con-  
sumption of food and drink, to enjoying the atmosphere \(or not enjoying it, since  
not everyone likes every event\), participating in activities such as games or dancing,  
or doing unusual or sometimes outrageous things.  
There are a number of more general social implications of having a special event.  
In community terms, many events, particularly personal ones and events run by the  
community itself, have the benefit of improving social ties, and are an opportunity  
for the community to demonstrate that it can pull together for the greater good.  
These can be anything from local arts festivals to the Eurovision Song Contest. Even  
a tree planting day or street party can provide such opportunities. The role of events  
in encouraging social interaction and the celebration of happy occasions is proba-  
bly more important in a society which, as a result of modern media, modern work  
methods and the relative decline of the ‘traditional’ family structure, feels a greater  
need to maintain social contact. Without the social contact that events often give,  
the feeling of social isolation in a society where even work can be conducted in a  
solitary way, such as from a computer in the home office, can be very great. Human  
beings are social animals \(an issue typically overlooked in the hype that often goes  
with new technological innovations\), and the growth of the events business may in  
part be due to the need to increase opportunities for social and physical interaction  
in the community, at a time when less interaction is possible in the work or home  
environment than at any time in the past. In such a case, organisations \(particularly  
those that rely on technology\) may have to give more serious thought as to how to  
help their employees interact and develop the social skills and interests that are the  
key to maintaining a cohesive inter-social structure.  
Social impacts can also be seen in a wider context, perhaps as a potential mech-  
anism for strengthening weak community structures in a particular location. The  
Notting Hill Carnival in London was one of the major driving forces behind improve-  
ments in relations between local communities with different ethnic backgrounds, and  
ultimately helped to drive forward many community social and political initiatives.  
But care must be taken not to see special events as some kind of panacea for local  
social or economic problems. Events may provide positive impacts, but there may  
well also be some negative impacts, which may be unexpected or unplanned \(Deery  
and Jago, 2010\). There are no panaceas, only a range of tools which, if handled cor-  
rectly, and if well received on the part of local people, might work positively for the  
benefit of all. You cannot impose a special event and say\: ‘There you are, enjoy that.’  
It is very easy and very common for events only to be understood in, say, economic  
terms, because these are the easiest to measure. However, many events have only  
modest economic or general impacts, or none at all. For example, small community  
events, which form a large percentage of events staged, should be seen in terms of a  
wide range of implications, of which the economic ones might only be of the most  
minor kind. Let us suppose a local hobby club such as a hockey team wishes to  
gain new members. It may be that the way of doing this is to hold a ‘new members’  
day’ event which will attract public attention, and thereby generate interest and the

The aim of this case study is to examine the social and community context of an event with the  
following objectives\:  
• To consider the role and functions of the Beer Festival in the life of the town of Vrchlabi.  
• To highlight why small community events remain important.  
• To examine some positive and negative effects of events.  
**T**he small town of Vrchlabi, north west of Prague  
in the Czech Republic, is typical of many com-  
munities throughout Europe, which run modest  
local events and festivals. The town has a popu-  
lation of about 13,500 and was historically known  
for the mining of stone and gems. It is in a pleas-  
ant mountain area which is now popular for winter  
sports such as downhill and cross-country skiing, as  
well as hiking, walking, mountain biking and hang-gliding  
in the summer. The town’s chief features are  
its Baroque town hall, Renaissance castle and the  
monastery of St Augustin. The town holds a number  
of events each year, of which the most well known  
are the Medieval Festival and the Krkonosske \(Giant  
Mountain’s\) Beer Festival.

# 67  
The beer festival has \(up to 2018\) been running  
for 21 years and attracts not only local people but  
also visitors to the Krakonos region, as well as tour-  
ists from further afield including many from other  
countries. This is not a huge affair though, at most  
perhaps 1,000 people may attend at any one time  
and the event is essentially a day event, starting at  
9.00 am on the Saturday \(usually the second week-  
end in August\) and finishing at 2.00 am on Sunday  
morning. The festival is organised by the local civic  
association, a role which might be performed in  
other towns by all kinds of community bodies such  
as the Chamber of Commerce, the tourist office  
or the town council itself. Often, though, in small  
towns, the town council has too little money and too  
little time to put on events and so, like in Vrchlabi,  
event organising is down to willing volunteers with  
the council and other local bodies acting as part-  
ners or supporters. Members of the Vrchlabi Civic  
Association split the task of organisation between  
them, with assistance from a small group of other  
people and local volunteers. The two main tasks  
comprise the organisation of the programme, the  
bands, performances and security on the one hand;  
and arranging the provision of the beers, catering  
and sales stands on the other.  
The beer festival naturally offers beer and in the  
2018 event beer was available from eight different  
breweries for visitors to taste, drink and compare.  
The event also provides an opening ceremony, with  
the town mayor and the mythological figure of Kra-  
konos \(King of the Mountain\) doing the honours. For  
the rest of the day, the town square hosts the event,  
and in addition to the provision of beer, there are  
stands and side booths which sell food and other  
refreshments as well as local items and craft goods.  
By way of entertainment there is a competition to  
judge the best beer, which appears to operate by  
the simple technique of people voting on a voting  
paper\: the beer with the highest pile of voting papers  
\(measured with a micrometer if necessary\) wins. In  
addition, there are other activities such as a beer  
barrel-rolling competition and throughout the day an  
entertainment programme is provided by a series  
of local bands including the town and local brass  
bands, visiting bands and tribute artists.  
As with many small community events, the  
implications and issues of running such an event  
are modest. The event brings in visitors and money  
to the town, but being a one-day event we proba-  
bly shouldn’t think in terms of ‘economic impact’  
\(this often implies something bigger\) but more in  
terms of the modest income to the event, the town  
and its businesses \(Hall and Sharples, 2016\). The  
Giant Mountain’s Beer Festival pays for its costs and  
makes a small profit or contribution for the organ-  
isers. The brewers and the bands, the stallholders  
selling food and other items all make some money.  
Local shops, cafés and other businesses, such as  
guest houses, self-catering chalets and suppliers in  
general all benefit. Some visitors to the beer festival  
will stay the whole weekend and their contribution  
to the local economy will therefore be greater than  
those just attending for the day, not only because  
they are staying overnight but also because they  
may undertake some other activity on the Sun-  
day, perhaps visiting other local tourist attractions,  
hiring mountain bikes, and again buying things in  
the shops, cafés and inns of Vrchlabi. The nega-  
tive effects of running the event are wear and tear  
\(small routine damage\) associated with increased  
numbers of visitors, additional litter, issues of traffic  
congestion, parking and noise, and maybe a few  
drunks to take home in wheelbarrows at the end of  
the night. These small negative effects are part of  
the price we expect to pay for the enjoyment, good  
and greater benefits of an event\: even if you have a  
dinner party for friends at home, you still have to do  
the washing-up and tidy the house in the morning.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** From your experience of events, make a table  
showing the positive and negative effects of  
an event. How can the positive effects be  
increased and the negative effects contained?  
\(Remember you are never going to eliminate  
negative effects completely, any more than  
you can avoid tidying up after a party.\)  
**2** ‘Economic impact’ is a term which we often  
associate with large-scale events. Can this term  
be applied to local events, and if so how?

be of genuine help in maintaining community

desired new members. The event may make no money, because it isn’t intended to do,  
and have no other measurable impacts, but it still has to be organised, be promoted  
and be interesting to fulfil its purpose.  
We can look at many small community events in this way. A local brass band  
competition may be held for the pleasure of competing and entertaining the public\:  
its economic impact may be non-existent and the only monetary implication might be  
that a small admission charge is made or a raffle held to raise enough money to pay  
for the venue or contribute to some new instruments, the upkeep of the band room  
or help pay the routine bills. In many communities, villages and towns, events are  
often a social exercise. They are put on for the pleasure and enjoyment of the com-  
munity and they might be socially or charitably orientated. Annual village fairs and  
festivals often fall into this category. Their primary purpose is not to attract visitors  
or tourists; the event simply serves to provide some social cohesion and interaction  
for the local people and to generate a spirit of goodwill and happiness. We can look  
at the many kinds of events put on by a local village or town and study what the  
implications are. You could do this for a place near you\: put together a list of all the  
events you can find which occur there and then consider what they are for, and what  
the implications are. In all probability there will be a range of events, some social,  
some charitable, some sporting, some celebratory, and so on.  
Events can be seen in terms of performing a social role and acting as a stimulus  
for other related activities, such as tourism. For a town or city wishing to become a  
tourist destination, elements such as attractions, accommodation, transport, infra-  
structure and facilities must be present. In looking back at the historical develop-  
ment of some major destinations, it can be seen that all these are present, although  
the destination may not have had anything to offer in the beginning apart from a  
natural attraction \(such as a beach or a rural landscape\). This has been the case  
for resort towns such as Brighton \(England\), Howth \(Ireland\) or Scheveningen \(the  
Netherlands\). In addition to the attractions of the seaside or countryside, some  
towns have relied for their tourist development on the architectural attraction of  
a great building, such as a castle or stately home, or of an event such as a market,  
fair or religious festival. Some destinations developed simply because royalty or  
the upper classes visited them, such as Brighton, where the Prince Regent kept his  
mistress, or Biarritz which developed after the Empress Eugene built a palace there  
\(see Figure 4.2\).

A destination was often intended to build on existing elements such as a pleasant  
location, warm climate or tourist attraction in or near the town. The availability of  
local accommodation, places of refreshment \(restaurants and cafés\) and good trans-  
port networks \(by sea, road or rail\) also helped. In many tourist resorts there was  
no major physical attraction, such as a museum or theme park, but often the tourist  
season could be driven entirely by special events, anything from a carnival to a jazz  
festival or air show \(see Figure 4.3\).

In looking at the social implications of events, we have seen that the main impacts  
are for events to create better social interaction, help develop community cohesion,  
increase cultural and social understanding, and improve the community’s identity  
and confidence in itself. These are very important gains for many communities. We  
must, though, sound a note of caution, particularly for large scale, mega-events.  
As with some of the issues of sustainable tourism, depositing a major international  
event on a small, undeveloped community could do some damage to that com-  
munity, perhaps resulting even in the destruction of its identity, particularly if the  
activity is badly handled, organised without thought for the outcomes, or without  
regard to the carrying capacity of the location \(i.e. how many people the location  
can cope with\). Nevertheless, the vast majority of events have tremendous positive  
outcomes\: they serve to celebrate and to entertain, to strengthen and improve social  
bonds, they increase community involvement and confidence, and they help make  
people happy.

# Economic implications  
The impacts on a community of a major event, be it a sporting event or a large cul-  
tural event such as a festival, can be looked at in terms of cost–benefit analysis or  
through economic multiplier analysis \(Lilley and DeFranco, 2003; Kim, et al., 2017\).  
An event itself may not, for example, provide huge direct employment or income,  
but the indirect effects on local businesses, local services and local infrastructure and  
environment could be extremely significant. A number of festivals have had this type  
of analysis carried out, such as the Edinburgh Festival, where about 85 per cent of  
income came from tourists, making the impact rather greater than if the money had  
simply been ‘recycled’ by local people \(i.e. spending money on a festival, art activity  
or event, rather than on some other local activity such as day-to-day shopping\).  
The indirect effects of incoming spending of this kind may include the support of  
activities such as retailing \(visitors buying anything from magazines to clothing\) and  
catering \(visitors using restaurants, coffee shops and pubs\), to less obvious visitor sup-  
port of services such as transport, taxis, printers, technical equipment, local musicians  
and entertainers, marquee contractors, photographers and many other types of sup-  
plies and suppliers. Some towns, cities and resorts have seen events as their economic  
salvation when other forms of tourism, such as business meetings or heritage tourism,  
might not be appropriate to their area. It is also thought that events that have many  
participants, as opposed to many spectators, have a greater economic impact on a  
destination. Thus, it might be quite reasonable to say that a fairly low-key event, such  
as a three-day international conference of dentists, might have more economic impact  
than, say, a premier league soccer match, because even though the soccer was higher  
profile, its spectators are more transient. A number of event-stimulated developments  
have been undertaken on this economic basis, such as the construction of Symphony  
Hall in Birmingham or the Exhibition and Congress Centre in Maastricht.  
This is not to say that the running of a major special event is the correct solution  
to the economic problems of any town, city, region or resort. If a public body, such  
as a city council, invests in an event, or in the physical event facilities, it must perhaps  
forego investing in something else, say an industrial or retail development. There is  
an opportunity cost, and even a danger that the event might itself run at a loss. In  
considering the possibilities for the economic regeneration of an area, the running  
of a major event is only one option, not a panacea, and may be a significant cost or  
burden on the sponsoring organisation, such as a city council. For this reason, special  
events are often used as part of some wider initiative, so that an element of synergy  
can be gained from the event in conjunction with, say, building a new arena. Equally,  
it might be recognised that the objectives of a particular event are to provide short-  
term, not long-term, gain. This objective alone might be worthy enough.  
In the context of a community, the running of a major event is often perceived as  
having a positive social and economic impact, in much the same way that the con-  
struction of a factory or tourist attraction would. This economic impact is not very  
well documented, but some studies, especially of sporting events, such as games and  
Grands Prix, give various indicators as to the benefits of events. In the case of some  
events, the operation and running of them is seen as a matter of civic business, that is  
to say, the event may be organised or even sponsored by the city or town council and  
based at least in part on the economic and social benefits that it brings to the commu-  
nity, in terms of increased numbers of visitors or an increased visitor spend. Given the  
size and extent of some events, the economic and social benefits may be very great.

• 145 countries participated  
• 22 million visits to the Expo and its associated events

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the economic and sustainability implications of an event,  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the effect of a major international event on a given location.  
• To discuss how the economic effects and sustainability outcomes of an event might be  
measured.  
**T**he Universal Expo held in Milan in 2015 had  
been initiated over seven years before with an  
application to the supervising body of these events,  
the Bureau International des Expositions \(BIE\), who  
determined Milan was to be the next holder at that  
time \(1st March 2008\). Universal Expositions are held  
normally at five-year intervals, the next being in 2020  
in Dubai. There are also interval expositions, that is  
to say specialised in some way, such as the Expo in  
Astana in 2017. The 2015 Milan Expo had a theme  
of ‘Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life’ and was the  
first Expo ever to draw up a Sustainability Report.  
The direct economic impact of the event resulted  
from\: 1\) investments by the Expo 2015 company; 2\)

operating costs of the Expo 2015 Company e.g.  
salaries paid to employees and contractors; and 3\)  
investments by participating countries. The indirect  
economic impact of the event was due to\: 1\) the  
indirect effects of items comprising the direct eco-  
nomic impact; and 2\) the total impact of the incom-  
ing flows of tourism. The legacy of the event, namely  
the long-term impacts of the Exposition, is in terms  
of\: 1\) business start-ups; 2\) value development of  
the real estate portfolio; 3\) growth in foreign direct  
investment attracted by the event; 4\) increased tour-  
ism. A study for the company estimated an over-  
all impact of €23.6 billion of additional economic  
production for the period 2012–2020, of which  
€3.2 billion would be direct impacts, €14.2 billion  
would be indirect impacts and €6.2 billion would be  
legacy effects.  
The city of Milan, in Lombardy in northern Italy,  
has a population of some 3.2 million people. Its  
origins go back to about 600 BC and it became  
part of the Roman Empire in 222 BC as the Roman  
city of Mediolanum, until 538, when it was very  
nearly destroyed by the Goths, after which Milan  
only gradually recovered, becoming part of Lom-  
bardy and being, in due course, largely ruled by its  
Archbishops. Various changes to its political con-  
dition took place throughout the middle ages and  
the renaissance, but it remained an important centre  
for trade and commerce, and these activities sus-  
tained its development over time. After many wars  
and tribulations, it became part of the Kingdom  
of Italy in 1861, now the Republic of Italy. Milan is  
well-known for its culture and its many fine build-  
ings including the cathedral, the Castle Sforza and  
La Scala Opera House. Milan is the industrial and  
financial heart of Italy and a major fashion centre of  
the European Union.  
The 2015 Universal Expo covered a site to the  
north-west of the city centre, which had to be pro-  
vided with new infrastructure such as main services  
\(e.g. power\) and transport. The Master Plan for the  
site was based on a design of two axes at right  
angles, recalling the layout of ancient Roman cities\:  
The ‘Decumanus’, an avenue some 1.5km long,  
which crossed the whole site from east to west.  
Along this axis, named the ‘World Avenue’, were  
the plots where the various participants’ pavilions  
were built, so giving every country a position in the  
public eye; and the ‘Cardo’, an avenue 350m long  
crossing the Decumanus and oriented north-south,  
along which the Italian participants were located. At  
the intersection of these two main avenues was a  
square, the ‘Piazza Italia’, symbolising the meeting  
of Italy with the world. The more significant instal-  
lations to be built by Expo 2015 on the Exposition  
site were the following\: The Lake Arena, the biggest  
open space for visitors, the venue for arts events and  
installations; The Mediterranean Hill, its top affording  
a panoramic view of the site; The Expo Centre, with  
space for events, the 1,500-capacity auditorium and  
the performance area; The Expo-Cascina Merlata  
Walkway, providing access for participants’ staff  
housed in the Cascina Merlata complex; The Fiera  
Walkway, to facilitate entry and exit to and from the  
Exposition site particularly from the railway station  
by the public; The Open-Air Theatre, a temporary  
building in the site’s southern portion, with accom-  
modation for some 11 000 people on grassy banks  
and steps, for open-air concerts, stage shows and  
official ceremonies; The Cascina Triulza, an old farm-  
house, an important example of the historic archi-  
tectural and environmental heritage represented by  
these Milanese farmsteads, was to be restored and  
bequeathed to the city as part of the Expo’s perma-  
nent legacy.  
The facilities were developed through a mixture  
of economic investments by the city, regional and  
national governments as well as the supporting  
infrastructure, the pavilions of the different countries  
being developed by their national governments  
and sponsors. The Expo ran from 1st May 2015 to  
31st October 2015 and attracted some 22 million  
visitors. Twenty-four prizes were awarded by the  
BIE for the various pavilions including first prizes for  
Germany for development of the theme, France for  
architecture and Japan for harmonious diversity. In  
its statement of purpose, the Expo Company said,  
of sustainability and social responsibility\: ‘The imple-  
mentation of principles of sustainability in the design,  
realisation and management of the event is aimed  
at reducing its environmental impact to a minimum,  
enabling all stakeholders to take part in a truly sus-  
tainable experience which will set an example for  
future events’. In more general terms we can argue

that event sustainability is both a process and an  
ethical activity used to produce any event with a par-  
ticular concern for positive environmental outcomes  
and social responsibility. Sustainability in event man-  
agement incorporates socially and environmentally  
responsible decision-making into the planning pro-  
cess, the organisation and the implementation of all  
levels of an event. This is in order that the event is  
not detrimental to its local or general environment,  
or the carrying capacity of its venue and surround-  
ings; and that it has a care for green and heritage  
issues and social impacts, including those involving  
its participants, its visitors and its neighbours in the  
widest sense.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What reports have been published about the  
Milan Expo online and how do these reports  
vary in the emphasis they take or in the topics  
they choose to highlight and why?  
**2** How should you measure the impacts of events  
–  
in what terms and over what time period?  
**3** Could you adopt the same approach for  
smaller events as for events of this scale with  
the same types of economic or sustainability  
assessment?

There are a number of further websites and online reports that consider the Milan Expo. While it is often  
useful to begin studies with a generic website, such as Wikipedia, in this case the Wikipedia entry for the  
Milan Expo needs more work to be useful.  
# Political implications  
In past times, it might be thought that the political implications of events were rel-  
atively modest. However, this is clearly not so. For example, the political nature of  
the Roman gladiatorial games was well understood, and the ability of the Roman  
emperor or members of the Roman upper classes to put on a major spectacle contrib-  
uted to their status. Similarly, in medieval times much political status was attached  
to royal events such as jousts and tournaments. Therefore, certain types of events do  
have political impacts, even if that impact is only to provide a mechanism to indicate  
some form of political status. The opening of the town’s festival, or a civic reception  
to celebrate some new feat of progress, are opportunities for the mayor and council  
to be seen in public, officiating at the ceremony with appropriate purpose and dig-  
nity. The political implications are simply that the town’s dignitaries are expected to  
be seen doing what the townspeople elect and pay them to do. In this respect many  
modern events fulfil the same purpose, and politicians gain the benefit of being asso-  
ciated with useful civic activities and positive special events.  
The pride with which civic dignitaries were once regarded is sometimes neglected  
today, but towns and cities often organised events or constructed things that  
demonstrated their commitment to the good of the general population and to mark  
some technical or civic progress. This might be anything from the construction of  
a new hospital to the maintenance of some curious quirk of local tradition \(such  
as ‘cheese rolling’ in Brockworth, England; ‘phallus dancing’ in Tyrnavos, Greece;

**A**fter several years’ work, Max Reinhardt, with  
several friends and colleagues, succeeded  
in establishing a music festival in the Cathedral  
Square, Salzburg, Austria, during 1920. Although a  
lack of finance caused a break in 1924, the festival  
grew, under Reinhardt’s volunteer directorship, into  
an international event, expanding into several ven-  
ues and beyond music into drama. Quickly moving  
onto the international stage, the festival began radio  
broadcasts within five years \(radio being relatively

new at that time\). The festival has continued to the  
present day, despite various political difficulties in the  
80 years of its existence. Today a public square in  
Salzburg is named after Max Reinhardt.  
In 1950, the Salzburg Festival Foundation was  
set up, which put the event onto a formal and pro-  
fessional basis with a board of directors, and in  
1952 the festival became a founding member of the  
European Festivals Association. The festival benefits  
from the efforts of a broad base of supporters, rang-  
ing from high-profile managers to experienced arts  
patrons, who, since 1961, have operated under the  
umbrella of The Association of Friends of the Salz-  
burg Festival. In 1983, performances were relayed  
live for the first time to visitors in the Cathedral  
Square. During the 1990s organisers began long-  
term cooperation with sponsors such as Nestlé,  
ABB and Allianz, and a reorganisation of the fes-  
tival’s board and activities took place, introducing  
such innovations as subscription tickets for young  
people and ‘Curtain Up’ access to rehearsals.  
The expanding ‘festival district’ now encom-  
passes permanent venues, e.g. the Festival Halls;  
historic properties, such as the Felsenreitschule or  
Summer Riding School; open air and temporarily  
covered spaces, including the Cathedral Square and  
the courtyard of the Residence. This evolution in its  
organisation demonstrates both the financial scope  
of large festivals and the civic pride that they can build  
upon. The festival, during its long existence, has con-  
tributed significantly to the revitalisation of Salzburg as  
a cultural centre \(together with the city’s association  
with Mozart\), and to the imaginative use of many of  
its fine historic buildings for public activities.  
The importance of the festival to Austria’s image  
has, however, resulted in the rather unusual out-  
come that the festival was subsidised extensively  
by the Austrian government and the county and city  
councils of Salzburg. This may seem an excellent  
arrangement, and for some festivals, the availability  
of a modest subsidy has a financial, artistic, sport-  
ing or community benefit out of all proportion to the  
amount of the subsidy. The strangeness of the Sal-  
zburg Festival subsidy is that it is provided by law \(a  
political decision\)  
–  
the government and the councils  
have to pay for any deficit the festival makes.  
This may seem a wonderful idea \(for the taxpayer  
to comprehensively support a festival in this way\) but  
the unintended consequence has been that the Fes-  
tival Board has no incentive whatsoever to manage  
costs terribly well, nor has it any incentive to man-  
age demand properly. In the case of demand, this  
has resulted in low ticket prices and big demand,  
so although the tickets are attractively cheap, many  
people can’t get them because they run out \(Frey,  
2000\). After all, there is limited capacity of seating  
at many venues, so what is happening with ticket  
prices is that capacity is not being managed by  
adjusting the price elasticity of demand to match  
capacity, but simply by running out of tickets. The  
consequence of this is a black market in tickets and  
that many tickets only reach potential visitors in a  
discriminatory way, that is you may have to ‘know  
someone’ at the festival to have a chance of getting  
a ticket. Another consequence of obtaining govern-  
ment or other subsidies for festivals and events \(and  
this is a general point\) is that such subsidies will  
normally come with some kind of string attached.  
That is to say, the subsidy giver will probably want  
to exercise some influence over the festival or event.  
Although such an influence may appear harmless  
and benign, one has to bear in mind that politicians,  
in particular, have their own wishes and agendas.  
What may result is some constraint on the festival,  
its programme, its venue or its visitors, which was  
not foreseen by the festival’s organisers and which  
is ultimately detrimental to the event.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What benefits has the festival brought to Salz-  
burg, and for whom?  
**2** What problems might be associated with the  
success of a festival and how might they be  
addressed?  
**3** What kind of influence might a subsidy giver \(or  
a sponsor\) wish to have over an event? Could  
such an influence grow over time to the extent  
that the freedom of action of the event organ-  
isers was constrained by political or bureaucratic  
influences? What might these influences be?

having more than one kind of funding stream  
important, and if so, why?

# public events  
An event attended  
by members of  
the general public.  
‘raisin weekend’ in St Andrews, Scotland; or any number of other weird traditions  
still taking place around Europe\). Old photographs of ceremonies and celebrations  
often focus on this aspect of civic pride, something that, in our modern age, can be  
overlooked in an effort to seem ‘modern’, but which was, in past times, crucial to  
the ritual and traditional nature of events, and added to the political status of those  
dignitaries involved.  
Today, it is major events which tend to attract the attention of politicians \(and  
media\) and we may observe the very political nature of events such as the Olympics  
and National Days as well as specific events designed to influence public opinion  
about a particular politician or ideology.  
High-profile **public** **events** are attractive as mechanisms for producing social and  
economic benefits of the type noted earlier, and can focus and stimulate political will  
to promote and run them. Many events can be extremely positive in creating useful  
outcomes for the nation, region or area concerned. Nevertheless, political interest  
\(see Figure 4.4\) in an event may not be related to the good of the community or the  
local population, and there may be a hidden or even unpleasant political or media

agenda behind the event \(such as influencing the programme or types of performance  
allowed\). Indeed, there are examples of dictators and corrupt politicians attempting  
to use events to distract attention from some political problem they have created, or  
as a mechanism to improve their negative image. It is therefore important to under-  
stand that some types of events may well have a political element, and the student  
and practitioner of event management needs to be able to recognise when that polit-  
ical element may or may not be positive.  
Having sounded this note of caution, the most common political outcomes of  
events are positive and useful. A major event held in a town or city might not only  
help provide social and economic benefits such as community cohesion, jobs and  
income to local people, but it might significantly alter the image of the place in the  
long term. This can be a useful outcome especially for those locations that might  
have endured a long period of economic decline or social drift, for which a major  
special event could not only rekindle community involvement and civic pride, but  
also transform visitor perceptions of the place from negative to positive. This role is  
often performed by the designation of a city as a European City of Culture or similar  
local initiatives to change an old image.

# dEvelopmental implications  
By their nature, the vast majority of special events are fleeting, with little or no  
developmental impact. It is necessary only to consider the large number of, say, wed-  
dings that take place, to recognise the limitations of most kinds of events in terms  
of developmental and environmental impact – there is no impact, apart from having  
to sweep up the confetti. This is true of most events. Even some larger-scale events,  
such as a horse-racing day, might have little long-term impact except to provide  
some horse manure for the roses. It is therefore important not to get carried away  
on the bandwagon of environmental impacts, sustainability and disturbance. To do  
so would demonstrate a poor understanding of the real nature of most events as  
modest, passing affairs.  
A few events, however, have some developmental impact, usually because this is  
a specific aim of their creation. Developmental events may be used as one tool in a  
toolbox of potential mechanisms for redevelopment, image-building and regener-  
ation, as a means of producing some positive outcome. This outcome might be to  
support tourism or to improve the environment of a given location. However, there  
could be other ways of achieving this. It might be easier and more cost-effective to  
construct a new business park, hospital or conference centre, rather than to invest  
time and money in a developmental event in order to get some longer-term outcome  
from it. Indeed, the developmental impact of events will mainly relate to some phys-  
ical construction or re-use needed to put the event on, rather than to the running of  
the event itself. It depends entirely on the purpose of the event. Within these caveats,  
some events have been well-known for their impacts, notably a series of garden fes-  
tivals in the UK in the 1990s, expositions such as that at Hannover or Astana from  
2000 onwards or the Olympics in general right up to the present date.  
The developmental, regeneration and environmental impact of events does vary.  
International Garden Festivals, an example of regeneration, were intended to have  
both an image building and environmental impact, while other events have had  
image building and reconstruction impacts. The Sheffield Student Games in England  
resulted in the development of a range of sporting facilities, including the Ponds

FACTBOX  
• Ancient Olympic games first held in 776 BC, last held in 393  
• Restarted in modern times in 1896  
• Held every four years  
• Modern games are a significant economic and social activity  
• A key issue is often redevelopment of a run-down or neglected area  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider the development of the concept of the Olympic Games over  
time with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the history of the Games from earliest times and major steps in the development of the  
Games towards their modern incarnation.  
• To highlight how the Games have changed over time and how decisions made at different points in  
time have affected the nature of the modern Games.  
• To examine why legacy now seems to be an important aspect of the planning of the Games.  
**T**he Olympics are a global phenomenon in the  
events management firmament, seen as boast-  
ing a global reach that none can match and a her-  
itage that stretches back to the ancient world. Yet,  
as recently as the run-up to the 1984 games, it was  
seen as a poisoned chalice and many of its tradi-  
tions are fairly recent additions.  
Emperor Theodisius abolished the original Olym-  
pic Games, along with other pagan festivals within  
the Roman Empire during 393 AD, though there

were irregular attempts to revive them. In England,  
Robert Dover is credited with establishing the ‘Cots-  
wold Olimpicks’ including a shin-kicking contest, the  
day before Scuttlebrook Wake Fair in 1612; whilst  
an 1833 poem by Alexandros Soutsos, in the Helios  
newspaper, recalling the glory of the ancient Olym-  
pic Games, encouraged moves towards a revival in  
their homeland of Greece.  
In 1850, Dr Brookes established the Wenlock  
Olympian Class, within the Wenlock Agricultural  
Reading Society at Much Wenlock, England, and  
is credited with organising the ‘Wenlock Olympian  
Games’ as an attempt to revive the Games; the  
events were a mixture of athletics and traditional  
country sports such as quoits, football and cricket,  
and small cash prizes were awarded. By 1859,  
Evangelos Zappas, inspired by Soutsos’ poem, was  
organising the first of four ‘Zappian Olympic Games’  
which are said to have combined a fair, trade exhibi-  
tion and athletics meeting in Athens  
–  
again athletes  
competed for cash prizes, including one donated by  
Dr Brookes. In 1865, Dr Brookes and others estab-  
lished the National Olympian Association and, the  
following year, organised a version of the Games at  
the Crystal Palace, London. In Greece in 1870, the  
Panathenean Stadium had been restored in Athens,  
for the second ‘Zappian Olympic Games’  
–  
31 ath-  
letes competed across nine sports.  
From 1875 to 1881 archaeological excavations  
of the original site of the Games at Olympia further  
boosted interest in reviving them and in 1894 Baron  
Pierre de Coubertin helped to found the International  
Olympic Committee \(IOC\); intending the games to  
coincide with the 1900 Paris International Exposi-  
tion. Greek honour was aroused however, and in  
1896 the IOC organised the first modern Olympic  
Games in Athens. Underwritten by George Averoff  
and held in the restored 45,000-seat Panathenean  
Stadium, the games attracted some 285 male  
athletes from 13, mostly unofficial, national teams  
competing across ten disciplines  
–  
the opening  
ceremony being held on the 75th anniversary of  
Greece’s independence from Turkey.  
The IOC then held the Games as part of the  
1900 Paris International Exposition, at the Parc Vin-  
cennes, welcoming the first women athletes. Some  
1,066 athletes, from 22 national teams competed,  
across 15 disciplines, and attracted around 48.1  
million visitors, but the Games returned a loss of  
some FF \(French Francs\) 82,000. Originally sched-  
uled for Chicago, the next Games formed part of  
the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Some 680  
athletes, from 12 nations, competed across 17 dis-  
ciplines, but the event was sparsely attended and  
the US team won all but one event. In 1906, having  
refused an application for the Games to be based  
permanently in Greece, the IOC allowed the Interim  
Olympic Games \(or ‘intercalated’ games\) to be held  
in Athens; celebrating the 10th anniversary of the  
modern Games  
–  
the last time that they were not  
held in the first year of a four-year Olympiad.  
The 1908 Olympic Games were scheduled for  
Rome, but had to be relocated after the 1906 Mount  
Vesuvius eruption. The breadth and depth of sports  
administration made Britain a suitable last-minute  
replacement, so the Games were held at the Shep-  
herd’s Bush Stadium \(‘the Great Stadium’\), London,  
following on from the Franco-British Exhibition; whilst  
other events were held at Henley \(rowing\), Bisley  
and Uxendon \(shooting\), the Solent \(motor-boats\)  
and River Clyde \(yachting\). Allegations of domestic  
bias did, though, prompt a series of protests and  
saw these as the last games that a host country had  
jurisdiction over. The 1906 Games also introduced a  
system of Gold, Silver and Bronze medals and saw  
the first winter games represented, these not being  
separated until 1911, and whose structure was con-  
firmed by the later success of the 1924 International  
Winter Sports Week at Chamonix.  
The Olympic flag and oath appeared at the 1920  
Antwerp Games, whilst Citius, Altius, Fortius \(Faster,  
Higher, Stronger\) became the official Olympic motto  
at the 1924 Paris Games. An Olympic flame was  
kept burning for the first time at the 1928 Amsterdam  
Games; whilst the Olympic logo and Olympic Village  
first appeared at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. The  
1936 Berlin Games were a particular milestone. Not  
only were the Games televised, but Leni Riefenstahl  
made the influential ‘Olympiad’ documentary  
–  
for  
which several ceremonies \(e.g. the torch-relay from  
Olympia, carrying the Olympic Flame lit by the rays  
of the rising sun\) were introduced and in which sev-  
eral sports filming techniques \(e.g., cranes, tracking  
rails, cameras in pits or rising up flag poles\) were

pioneered. The 1948 London Games were the first  
to be televised, when the BBC paid some £1,500  
for the rights; television had only just been invented  
at that time.  
Following the riots ahead of the 1968 Mexico  
Games, the tragedy at the 1972 Munich Games and  
the debt left by the 1976 Montreal Games, the move-  
ment entered a low period. Innsbruck hosted the  
1976 Winter Games for the second time, after Den-  
ver defaulted; the 1980 Moscow Games prompted  
a widespread boycott and not only was Los Angeles  
the sole bidder for the 1984 Games, but it was not  
even the city itself which bid. The organisation of  
the 1984 Los Angeles Games, though, was seen  
as demonstrating that the event could be both prof-  
itable and beneficial; after that, an increasing num-  
ber of venues vied for the Games. After the 1994  
Lillehammer Winter Games, the Winter Games and  
Summer Games now alternate, biennially.  
The heightened profile that followed the suc-  
cesses at Barcelona in 1992, and Sydney in 2000,  
was overshadowed by governance issues linked to  
the awarding of the Winter Games to Salt Lake City  
and a judging debacle in its ice dancing competition.  
The expenditure of the Beijing Games and violent  
clashes during the torch-relay in 2008 heightened  
the challenges that the London 2012 games faced,  
in terms of raising finance during a recession and  
ensuring the promised ‘legacy’.  
The 2012 London Olympics ran for 17 days  
from 27th July to 12th August, after over five years’  
preparation work, planning and reclaiming a site  
situated along the Lower Lea Valley at Stratford,  
planting it as gardens, parkland and countryside,  
constructing the Olympic Stadium, Olympic Village,  
sporting facilities and infrastructure. Key issues were  
not simply the provision of the games themselves,  
but also the encouragement of young people’s  
involvement in sport, and from the developmental  
point of view, the legacy of the games in terms of  
its potential to regenerate the area covered by the  
Olympic Park and other local development out-  
comes \(Clark, 2008. Maennig and Zimbalist, 2012\).  
The 2016 Summer Olympics were held in Rio de  
Janeiro, Brazil, from 5th to the 21st August. More  
than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic  
Committees \(not all committees represent nations  
as such\), including new entrants Kosovo, South  
Sudan and the Refugee Olympic Team, participated.  
With 306 groups of medals, the games featured 28  
Olympic sports, including Rugby Sevens and Golf,  
which had been added to the Olympic programme in  
2009\. In terms of medals, the most golds were won  
by the United States, then Great Britain, then China.  
The Olympic events took place at 33 venues in Rio,  
and at five in São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador,  
Brasília and Manaus.  
At the time of writing, the most recent Olympic  
event has been the 2018 Winter Olympics held  
in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9th to the  
25th February. Its legacy aims included\:  
**1** At a National Level  
Creation of new growth engines by pursu-  
ing a balanced national development through  
establishment of transport infrastructure and by  
attracting investment\:  
express train service for Incheon Airport  
\(­ PyeongChang\), high-speed railway for Wonju  
\(Gangneung \), the second Yeongdong highway.  
**2** At a National/Regional Level  
Creation an environment legacy such as new  
renewable energy technology, eco-friendly venue  
construction, etc. \(greenhouse gas information  
system, wind farm, green building certification\).  
**3** At a Regional Level  
Improvement of residents’ awareness, infra-  
structure, tourism industry, local culture and  
sports culture; advanced ICT technology,  
advanced medical facilities and services.  
**4** At a Local Level  
Creation of a sustainable economic legacy for  
the local community through a social econ-  
omy, designation of 13 special zones; achiev-  
ing global standards in accommodation and  
restaurants, promotion of the social economy.  
It is the case that the modern games are suc-  
cessful, popular and noble in a way which would  
be recognised historically. Nevertheless, the Olympic  
movement faces further challenges as it wrestles  
with doping regulation, regulating athletes’ clothing  
and equipment, rationalisation of the participat-  
ing sports and ethics issues in the future. Looking  
forward, Tokyo, Japan, will be hosting the 2020  
­ Olympic Games.

Forge Pool, the Don Valley Athletic Stadium and the Sheffield Arena. The redevel-  
opment of Sheffield was also supported by investment in a tram system and in the  
private sector construction of the Meadowhall Shopping Centre, as well as more  
recent associated work in terms of a multiplex cinema and other businesses along  
the route of the tramway between Meadowhall and the Arena. The curiosity of the  
Sheffield development was that the Student Games made a loss in direct financial  
terms \(and left a €64 million debt\), but their longer-term impact in helping to turn  
around Sheffield’s once grim image and stimulate other developments has been sub-  
stantial and instructive. Similarly, the exhibition ground of the Hannover Expo 2000  
is still in use for major fairs in Germany and the area around the Expo Plaza has been  
turned into a centre for information technology, design, media and the arts. Further  
Expos have taken place in Milan, Italy in 2015 and at Astana, Khazakhstan in 2017,  
with the 2020 event scheduled for Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Yet the scale  
of development of the Olympics and International Games and Expos is unusual\:  
most special events have no such impacts, and do not need to, as these are not part  
of their objectives.  
Our assessment of the context of events has been based around the four factors  
of social, economic, political and developmental issues. However, we should for the  
benefit of those familiar with other methods, touch on some other contexts. These  
include Technological, Legal, Environmental and Ethical, International and Industrial  
contexts. For example, we have noted that in PESTELI analysis \(see Figure 4.5\), the  
most common components are Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environ-  
mental, Legal and Industry implications. Readers may wish to choose a method of  
assessment, based on the components we have given in detail above and add \(or  
subtract\) different contexts depending on what kind of assessment they wish to  
carry out. Let us suppose it is PESTELI. We already have some details for political,  
economic and social impacts, and it might be considered that we have touched on  
environmental issues when discussing developmental implications.  
Technological implications are those issues which impact on events in terms of  
technological change. On the one hand we can see that the rate of technological  
change in the events business is relatively slow. The Games of 2,000 years ago would  
still be recognisable to us today, as events are in essence activities in which the main  
component is people, and we would hope, happy people. Having said that there are

changes in technology which have implications for participants, organisers and man-  
agers and these might for example be new technologies in ticketing, communications,  
marketing, energy use, mobile technology, lighting, sound and ancillary systems. New  
inventions and developments are taking place all the time and technology transfer  
from other industries \(for example till systems, or display methods\) is quite rapid.  
The development and expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar and  
wind power also falls into this category – 20 years ago it might have been virtually  
impossible to provide a major power source in the middle of a remote event location  
\(a field or mountain\) without bringing in major infrastructure\: today, a few solar  
panels, their battery or storage support and accompanying switching might easily do  
this at very little cost to the event organisers.  
Legal issues cover changes to the context in which events operate in terms of  
changes to the law and legislation, which might originate at an international, national  
or local level. This can include anything from impacts on employment of paid staff, or  
the use of volunteers or charitable support staff, to implications about the use of dif-  
ferent types of material and equipment \(some older materials such as plastic might be  
banned, some new ones introduced\), and about the introduction of legal controls on  
a whole range of issues from the supervision of children to the signing of contracts  
for supplies and facilities.  
Industry implications are often about changes to the structure of an industry or  
the market in which it operates, and in some cases such change is very rapid. Think,  
for example, of the decline of the nuclear power industry in the face of the faster  
development of clean renewable energy, or the centralisation or contracting of an  
industry in response to difficult economic circumstances. These changes might be at  
a global, national or local level and might be linked to several of the other contexts,  
notably the economic and political contexts.

# Summary  
**T**he extent to which special events impact our lives may surprise  
the uninitiated. Daily life is improved in many ways. If this were  
not so, events would have had little or no impact on the cohesion of  
human society. In fact, events have a major impact and have been a  
feature of society from its earliest beginnings. Events serve to strengthen  
social bonds, to bring enjoyment and celebration to individuals,  
families, communities and society as a whole. There are also economic  
and political benefits, including the provision of direct and indirect  
employment, the enhancement of facilities and the improvement of local  
services, which are often stimulated by events. While some large-scale  
or developmental events may give us pause for thought about their wider  
impacts, especially culturally or politically, the vast majority of events serve  
to improve and enhance our society, at a time of significant social change.  
Events can also be seen in the context of promoting and sustaining  
tourism. Not all tourist destinations have physical attractions;  
consequently, some destinations rely on a continuing programme of  
events during the tourist season to sustain them. This ensures both the  
provision of short-term, events-related jobs and, crucially, helps to secure  
permanent jobs, which a small town might not otherwise be able to  
retain without the continuing stream of events visitors and tourists. In this  
respect, the involvement of locals, for example, in running their own small  
sales-stands at fairs and shows, in catering, and in casual employment  
in key activities, helps to keep tourist spending in the local economy  
\(much more directly than it would if tourists simply spent their money at  
national chain retailers in the town\). The focus on community involvement  
in events is therefore important, and methods of engaging the community  
need to be carefully considered, especially by event tourism providers.  
As a generality, we can assess or examine the events business in a  
number of ways and with a variety of management tools. Not all parts  
of the events business would do this, for small local or community  
events there is no need and no management expertise to do it, and nor  
should we expect it to be done. However, on a larger scale, for major  
or international events, or for the business as a whole, it is possible and  
perhaps useful to assess the context or contexts in which we operate and  
a useful and thought-provoking exercise to do so.

# Introduction  
This chapter is the first in the sequence of chapters dealing with how to run an event.  
We have tried to present this as a series of steps. In practice, though, as the event  
begins to come together, many of the parts of the process will overlap, so if you are  
using this book for the first time you might want to follow the order of the chapters,  
or you may simply want to dip in and look at the elements you need.  
We may wish first of all, to consider why we are planning an event, what is the pur-  
pose? Now the answer to this may lie in the type of event \(Bassett and Dowson, 2018\).  
If we are planning a dinner party for our friends or to go to a café, bistro or restaurant  
to celebrate someone’s birthday, which we may have organised through social media,  
then the answer is that we want to enjoy ourselves and be with our friends; there is  
no complicated purpose beyond this, and there is no need for one. On the other hand,  
we may be part of a group or committee planning an event for fundraising or to make  
a profit to support some charitable objective. Indeed, making a profit might be a key  
element of commercial-type events, in order to fulfil a contract, put on a display or  
satisfy a particular request or market demand, and the money made in the process  
of doing this may help provide employment and increase local wealth or go towards  
helping to fund a local service. Very often, festival-type events cover several of these  
issues; they need to make a profit each year to continue, so they are self-sustaining from  
each year’s income and they are there for the enjoyment of participants or to celebrate  
some local tradition. Alternatively, the purpose may be to restore the reputation of an  
event or restart one that had failed or lapsed, and in this case the issues of why need to  
be considered very carefully, as there may or may not be legitimate reasons for failure  
or for the need to begin again \(Carlsen et al., 2010\). These issues need to be considered  
at the early planning stage – in short, why are we doing this event and what is it for?  
For most events, time, money, people and effort could be in short supply and the  
end result needs to be the best possible blend of resources available, and some of  
those resources may be quite limited, such as time, money, staff or expertise. It is also  
necessary at the beginning to recognise that existing organisational structures \(such  
as a company management hierarchy\) that serve an organisation very well ordinarily,  
might not be suitable for the non-routine activity of organising and running a special  
event. At a professional level, and for those organisations and individuals involved  
in the production of events, there is a need to use techniques that will ensure an  
effective, enjoyable and safe outcome, and this will require a more organised and  
structured approach than the cheerful informality of a family party.  
Getting started has two aspects\: finding people to do the job, which might be you  
and some friends, or a committee of some kind; and sorting out or screening the  
idea. The idea might be ready-made – you might have been set a task\: ‘Your job is  
to organise this year’s flower show’ or the task might not yet be known, except that  
it has to solve some problem or other\: ‘We need to raise some money to paint the  
village hall.’ So the first few steps in getting started are deciding who will do the job,  
what the idea is and whether it is feasible. Once you have a feasible idea or brief, the  
real work of planning begins.  
Events are, by their nature, non-routine. The techniques used to organise and manage  
them, though, are just the opposite. Planning is vital to the success of events, because  
of their complexity, their unusual requirements \(which may be considerably different  
from the routine activities of an organisation\), and because of the possible unfamiliarity  
of those organising an event with what is required. However, care may be needed as  
organisations sometimes get so locked into the planning process that they never get to

the doing part \(‘analysis paralysis’\), or the plan itself becomes a cage from which they  
cannot escape. No plan will survive its first contact with reality, however good it is.  
Some change, no matter how small, will be needed. Nevertheless, a plan is a guide and  
a tool against which progress can be measured, and should not be lightly disregarded.  
It can be argued that the planning process itself is the real key to what will happen  
\(Raj, 2017\). In having to sit down and prepare a plan, you have to think ahead about  
the event you are going to undertake, and therefore to identify the elements and  
issues that need to be sorted out. For this to work well there has to be a systematic  
approach, because unless you break the plan down into smaller component parts,  
something important could easily be missed. The planning process, consequently,  
reveals problems, risks and opportunities; it should serve to get people involved and  
act as a mechanism to search the environment for information. Having got some  
basic information together, planning has a number of benefits. These include better  
coordination, the creation of a focus, the experience of thinking ahead and the pro-  
vision of a device \(the plan\) for effective control of the progress and outcome of the  
event. However, planning is time-consuming and involves much thought and effort.  
Things may still go wrong, but this is a reason to plan, not to fail to plan.  
# Getting orGAnised  
The initial stage of getting an event started depends on what kind of activity is  
going on, or put more precisely, what the objectives are \(and whether there are pri-  
mary and secondary objectives\). The event can be personal, leisure-based, cultural or  
organisational. It may be organised by volunteers or by professionals. Some events  
are organised by a single dedicated individual with comparatively little support and  
encouragement, others are organised by committees or large groups of enthusiastic  
people. Getting started partly depends on what we know about the event and who  
will be doing it. In some cases, we know what the event will be, but not who will do  
it; in others we might have people who can organise it, but we don’t know what sort  
of event can be offered. For convenience, and because we have to start somewhere,  
let’s start with who is going to do it.  
If you are reading this book, it might be you. You may not be doing it alone, but  
have other people to help, or you might be part of an organising committee looking  
for ideas, or your job might be to organise the organisers. Mostly, a group of people  
will be involved \(see Figure 5.1\). Sometimes the group may already exist; a commit-  
tee that runs a club of some kind, perhaps a sports club, social club or hobby club,  
will also help run the event. This has the benefit of using an existing committee,  
whose committee members know each other and know their respective strengths  
and weaknesses. For a special event, the committee might want to add one or two  
extra members or advisers\: people who have arranged similar events before. Or the  
committee might want to form a smaller sub-committee to deal with the event, rather  
than the ‘parent’ committee doing it. A useful size for a committee is thought to be  
about six key people; but group size does vary, although the larger the group the  
more difficult it may be to achieve an integrated approach. Even with a small group  
there may be problems of cohesion, or difficulties in getting people to work together,  
so that careful leadership might be essential to the group’s progress.  
Equally, a new organising committee may be required. Forming this group from  
scratch may not be easy, because of the range of expertise that may be needed \(and  
not necessarily available\). It is possible to make a number of points about finding  
suitable candidates\: our initial instinct may be that we can get our friends to be on

In addition, various other people might be invited to attend some of the meetings, depending on the type  
of event and agenda of the meeting\:  
Representatives from the venue / Licence holders / Sponsors / Police / First Aid / Fire Service

Chamber of commerce member / Insurance adviser / ­ Professional specialists  
the committee, but they may not have the right kind of skills needed, or have the time  
or inclination. The search for people will need to consider\:  
• How much time will organising the event need from each person – can they  
spare this time to do the job properly?  
• Do they have previous experience – have they done anything similar, do they  
have a reputation for good work in an activity we might need, e.g. as a good  
organiser or good at finding resources?  
• Do they have good working relationships with other people – will they pull  
their weight and do they get on well with others?  
• If they have weak organisational skills, does another member of the committee  
have this as a strength, so that the committee has a balance of expertise?  
Most of all, the composition of the committee needs to be such that it is able to deal  
with the key jobs, whether these are organising, marketing, finance, finding resources,  
recording data, or just plain ‘being enthusiastic and keeping things going’. In essence,  
the organisation structure, whether it is a committee, a working party, an advisory  
group or a coordinating team, will need to be able to achieve the requirements of the  
job. It must be noted that, especially for volunteer groups, the pool of expertise may  
be limited and that this can act as a constraint on how fast things can be done, how  
well they might be done and perhaps how good the outcome will be \(see Figure 5.2\).  
The organisation of events can also vary according to how an event has grown.  
What was originally a one-off volunteer-organised event may have grown to the  
point where it is annual and organised by professionals. As events grow and their  
organisation possibly changes, there may also be changes in the culture of the organ-  
ising body for example, from informal to formal or from amateur to professional.  
Sometimes this kind of change may lead to conflict about how the event is to be run.  
This also implies that there is a continuum of organisational types, perhaps depen-  
dent \(although not entirely so\) on the growth stage of the event.  
As a starting point, we will assume an early stage of development of the event, and  
that there is a large volunteer committee doing the work. Indeed, some events organ-  
isations do not get beyond the volunteer approach, nor do they need to. However,  
once the organising committee has met and people have got to know each other a  
little, perhaps informally as well as formally, the first issue is what the event is going  
to be. As noted earlier, we might already, but perhaps we don’t know, and have no  
ideas, so what happens next?

# orGAnisational issues in events of varying sizes  
The nature of organisation between small local events, medium-sized events and  
large-scale international mega events is not especially one of differences in man-  
agement functions; but is about differences in scale, sophistication of techniques,  
intensity and detail of planning and questions of the division and allocation of  
responsibility. It is entirely reasonable to suppose that the organising committee  
of a local town festival would be composed of people who wish to be part of  
the event, who want to contribute something to the community or feel that they  
have the skills to contribute to the success of the event, and are doing so as their  
hobby and as a volunteer. The management functions of this committee, which  
might be no more than five or six people, would be planning, organising and  
controlling the event, raising money, undertaking marketing, obtaining resources  
and support, liaising with other local groups who would be participating in the  
festival, and so on.  
In a small committee you might expect there to be a chair, secretary, treasurer,  
marketing officer and a couple of other committee members with general organising  
roles. For a larger event there may be specific aspects of the event which need atten-  
tion, these may include  
• coordinating the programme of activities  
• the accreditation of teams  
• coordination of attendance and accommodation arrangements  
• transport  
• arrangements for the opening and closing ceremonies  
• facilities and services for the spectators and the media  
• provision of funding and identification of sources of sponsorship.

If we just break one of these activities down into its component parts, such as  
the programme, we begin to find the level of complexity involved. The programme  
may include  
• the briefing of staff  
• the technical rehearsals  
• the organisation of practice sessions  
• time trial tests  
• meetings for stewards  
• meetings for officials or judges  
• preliminary and main team meetings.

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the development of the organisation of the Avignon Festival  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the historical originals and development of the festival.  
• To highlight comparisons between the festival as it began and its modern incarnation.  
• To understand why professionalisation often occurs as festivals or events increase in size and complexity.  
**I**n 1947, theatre director Jean Vilar, with only a little  
additional help, organised a week of dramatic art  
in Avignon; this became the Avignon Festival a year  
later. The festival has a history and origins in perfor-  
mance art, rather than one of music or folklore, and  
the modern festival still reflects these origins, with  
many of the festival’s productions being theatrical  
in nature. However, the festival’s artistic programme  
in 2018, for example, covered performance arts,  
music, readings, exhibitions and films. There is also  
a festival ‘fringe’ known as the ‘off’ where smaller  
performances and informal activities take place on  
the sidelines of the main festival.  
In the early days of the festival, Jean Vilar under-  
took the work of organising the festival at a time  
when he was still Director of the National Popular  
Theatre in Paris, a post he relinquished in 1963 to  
devote all his time to the festival. Until 1963, the  
festival struggled for finance and was dependent on  
ticket sales and often on private support and spon-  
sorship. This limited the extent of the programme  
which could be put on. Jean Vilar introduced dance  
\(ballet\) to the festival in 1966 and film in 1967. In  
this period, the festival had effectively been admin-  
istered and supported somewhat by the city council  
of Avignon, with Jean Vilar as Director. He continued  
as head of the festival until his death in 1971, after  
which a new Director, Paul Puaux, took over.  
By 1980 the arrangement with the city council was  
becoming difficult to continue and, given the size of  
the event, a better funding structure was needed,  
other than that of just ticket sales and private fund-  
ing. Professionalisation of the festival effectively took  
place in 1980, when the festival was set up as a not-  
for-profit organisation with an Executive Board of  
seven people, made up of representatives from the  
French Government; the City of Avignon; the Vau-  
cluse County Council and the Provence-Alpes-Cote  
D’Azur Regional Council, as well as the Artistic Direc-  
tor. The Board meets two or three times a year and its  
responsibilities cover general trends, the festival pro-  
gramme, voting on the budget and dealing with major  
administrative issues. The budget is now split like so\:  
• 60 per cent comes from government subsidies  
and contributions from the various councils  
• 35 per cent from ticket sales and  
• 5 per cent from sponsorship and other private  
funding.  
The Festival employs about 20 permanent staff  
\(not all full-time\) and at peak periods, in the three  
weeks from the second week in July, there are about  
600 people working for the festival. There might  
typically be 40 productions, with 300 performances  
ranging over 20 venues, from the Pope’s Palace,  
through concert halls and theatres, to monasteries  
and even a disused stone quarry.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Is professionalisation an inevitable conse-  
quence of the organisational progress or  
growth of an event?  
**2** Why should the various city, county and regional  
councils have become involved in funding this  
event, why might it be important to them?  
**3** What benefits will this festival have brought to  
Avignon since its beginnings about 70 years ago?  
**4** What problems might be associated with an  
event which attracts 100,000 people to a historic  
city with many old buildings and finite resources?

The programme then has to deal with the event schedule itself perhaps including  
several sessions, sequences of activities or even competitions. In addition to the core  
activities, the planning and organisation of the programme may also cover opening  
and closing ceremonies and the social and support features such as local outings, a  
gala dinner or a farewell crew party. This is a lot to cope with and may take a whole  
year’s planning or more, and is one reason why many large sporting and cultural  
events rotate around different locations or countries, so that the burden of the work  
only falls on one place in any one year, not the same place every year. The larger the  
event, the larger the effort and the strains which the host organisation or community  
has to cope with.  
For mega events, we have said that the essential organisation issues are really a  
matter of scale, so that what would be an organising committee for a small event  
would not be adequate to take on the task of organising a large event. For this rea-  
son, mega events generally have an Executive Board, but it would be unwise for such  
a board to have more than 12 members, as the differences of opinion where there  
are large numbers of people involved could result in failure. This being the case,  
the normal approach at mega events is for there to be an Executive Board of quite  
small numbers, to which various working parties or sub-committees report. These  
sub-committees could be dealing with a wide range of operational requirements\:  
• fundraising and sponsorship  
• logistics and transport  
• visitor services and facilities  
• marketing and promotion  
• first aid, safety and security  
• staffing  
• the programme and participant activities  
• properties and venues, etc.  
In some cases, there might be as many as 25 or 30 committees involved in a mega  
event \(whereas a small event might only have one or two\) and the coordination of  
these is more likely to be via a regular meeting of Heads of Department or committee  
chairmen, than through the Executive Board, which would be there to oversee the  
strategy of the event, not to worry about how many portable toilets are required.  
This may seem a facetious comment, but as experienced practitioners and authors  
have noted\: a major myth about events is that they are planned according to a ratio-  
nal process. Often, the bigger the event, the worse the planning process is and the  
more interference it is subjected to from politicians, sponsors and other stakehold-  
ers. An event manager may then not have the level of control which many suppose.  
At mega events, the brief may well have been determined and handed down before  
professional advice is sought. The process in a case like this has firstly identified  
some vague need for a specific project, has then seen the development of a cursory  
report promoting the idea, and a range of sometimes incoherent decisions are then  
made which require the development of a plan to justify the project afterwards.  
Consequently, the event manager, or the Executive Board role is to sort out a way  
of providing it. This process may, of course, be successful; occasionally, though, it  
isn’t and a spectacular and expensive flop follows; or much more often, the event is  
a success, but there are a long list of cost over-runs which originate in the haphazard  
vagueness of the original idea.

# Event feasibility\: finding and testing an idea  
The feasibility of an event might not have been considered at all, because it seemed  
‘such a good idea’. But without a doubt, most event planning would benefit from  
a brainstorming phase when various ideas are thrown in and tossed around to ‘see  
which is best’. Unfortunately, this often involves little more than the organising  
committee having a couple of beers and saying, ‘Yeah, we’ve got it, it’s going to  
be fantastic.’ To a detached observer, this conclusion will probably result in the  
response\: ‘Is it?’  
In practice, there is a need for a systematic approach, as with much of events  
management. Being systematic helps us in situations where we have limited exper-  
tise, and when the time period in which events have to be scheduled may be quite  
short and have to rely on volunteer labour or community support to achieve our  
aims. In regard to feasibility, major events might well get into intensive methods of  
assessment, such as cost–benefit analysis or investment appraisal or related formal  
assessment methods \(O’Toole, 2011\). For the more common type of event, perhaps  
of the kind put on by a town or village or by a voluntary organisation, a relatively  
straightforward series of tests could be applied, in the form of ‘screening’. From this  
first phase, more detailed planning can follow.  
There are three screens or filters that we can put suggestions through. These are  
the marketing screen, the operations screen and the financial screen. All are intended  
to sort out less viable ideas and help to identify the idea\(s\) that will work the best  
when tested against the objectives or criteria set. It is important to recognise, how-  
ever, because of the varied nature of special events, there may not be one ‘perfect fit’.  
The end of the screening process may still result in several acceptable ideas – or in  
none. The organisers will finally have to make a choice about what to do. In addi-  
tion to these processes, once an event has been agreed on, the first of many planning  
activities must begin. This first activity is about the ‘lead time’ for the event, or, put  
more simply, whether there is enough time to get it booked and organised. In most  
cases the answer will be yes, it can be done in the timescale, but careful planning  
and forethought about the critical timing issues will focus attention on whether the  
event really is achievable in the time available. Many events go badly because of lack  
of time to organise them properly, and many project management texts argue that  
a poor level of planning during the early stages, due to a shortage of time, creates  
problems that will surface later.  
We should bear in mind that all special events require a feasibility process,  
although some events happen simply because they have to. Typically, it is unlikely  
that personal events require a feasibility process\: you obviously don’t feasibility test  
a dinner party, but you do think about what is needed to get it right. With personal  
events, the ‘feasibility’ is not a formal process, but is much more likely to be an infor-  
mal, even unconscious, decision about what will happen. There may be constraints,  
such as the availability of money or where to have it, but these may affect just the  
size or magnificence of the event rather than if it goes ahead or not. In this case the  
event is predetermined, and the real issue is how to make it happen.  
On the other hand, many events do not develop by such a simple process, espe-  
cially given the vast range of special events that take place. Let us consider the  
three screens, or filters, that we should put potential events through\: the marketing  
screen, the operations screen and the financial screen. Suppose the Scouts need to  
raise money for a new roof for the Scout Hall\: there may be many possible events

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. The screening process  
that could be put on to raise the money, but there has to be some way by which a  
selection is made. Perhaps a list of ideas of what the Scouts could do is put together\:  
• a car wash day  
• a theatrical play  
• a sponsored swim  
• a sale of pledges \(a pledge is a gift contributed, then auctioned\)  
• a jumble or car boot sale.  
The criteria for what to do might include what type of event has been successful  
in the past; what can be organised, given the resources of the Scout-pack; what might  
earn the most money, and so on. These are relatively simple considerations, but they  
still represent a very basic kind of feasibility.  
For larger-scale, public and organisational events in particular, there may well be  
an issue of how to choose from a range of possible activities for, say, fundraising, or  
for a product launch, and how to screen the choices to identify the one most likely  
to be effective. It has been noted in the past that\: ‘However good an idea may seem  
to be, if it cannot win sufficient support, and if it is unlikely to attract the public of  
a locality, the best thing to do is to drop it.’  
# 95  
# The screening process  
The process of screening is very important. Not only does the event have to be  
possible to carry out, it must also attract sufficient support to be successful. Let us  
consider this process in more detail.  
The first stage of the screening is to come up with the initial concept or set of ideas  
that would be tested \(see Figure 5.3\). In some cases, a better range of ideas might be

# The marketing screen  
Having identified a number of ideas or concepts for a possible event, there has to be  
a process whereby the organisers or clients can sort out what concepts will be most  
suited to the target market. This implies a good knowledge of the target market\: the  
type of people, their demographic or social profile, age group, familiar activities,  
past experience of events, size of the target group, and so on. This can be approached  
in two ways. Either the results of the initial brainstorming or listing session can be  
checked roughly against the opinions of the organising committee \(who, after all,  
will have to be committed to an idea in order to make sure it has a chance of suc-  
cess\), or some pilot research can be done to see what the potential market makes of  
the list of potential events. This may be essential, as there is the possibility that the  
organising committee may not be representative of the target market \(e.g. in terms  
of age group, life experiences, gender, etc.\). Detailed research about the event finally  
chosen could be carried out in the planning phase, but an initial pilot questionnaire  
could explore first reactions to the range of ideas \(Goldblatt, 2014\) \(Figure 5.5\).  
The essential factor that the marketing screen is intended to deal with is whether  
the various ideas or concepts will work in the target market. In addition, it will be  
necessary to consider whether the ideas are sufficiently different from \(or even sim-  
ilar to\) successful competing events. Special event organisers are often very poor at

pulling in information about other events that may be taking place at the same time  
and targeted at the same market as their own concept. This may result in clashes  
of dates, or two different organising groups putting on almost the same type of  
event. The issue of the ‘environmental search’ is a way of doing this. Identification  
of competing events can be difficult, but should at least involve compiling a list  
of dates when similar events take place in the area, obtainable from the internet,  
tourist information, from local ‘What’s On’ publicity, magazines or trade media,  
together with a knowledge of activities in the calendar, or by checking locally for the  
same period in the previous year, and getting people in the organising committee to  
ask their friends and other contacts if anyone is aware of similar events. This should  
produce a list of what else is going on, which will help serve a number of purposes\:  
• It will identify dates to avoid.  
• It will give a feel for what goes on and what the local market likes.  
• It may give additional ideas or identify gaps in the market that are not being filled.  
In this way it will be possible to create a shortlist of events that will satisfy the  
overall objectives of the organising committee or clients \(if this is a commercial or paid  
event\), but will also suit the available target market and run at an appropriate time,  
not competing with other activities. This done, there is the final question of whether  
the list of ‘possibles’ fits in with the organisational type. There is not much point in

• what will work in a given market.  
• what else might be going on by way of competition.  
• what an organisation would see as appropriate, and most of all.  
• what demand there should be from the target market.  
Having done this, the organiser can move on to the operations screen.  
# The operations screen  
So far, from a list of ideas or concepts screened against the marketing criteria for an  
event, there will probably still be a large number remaining that might work. How-  
ever, the event manager also needs to consider what is achievable. All events have  
various resource needs, based on how adventurous, ambitious or limited the ideas  
are, what expertise and staffing is available, what locations or venues are available  
with capacity on the required dates, what timescale and what technology or other  
equipment will be needed. There may also be risk assessment or risk management  
issues which may prevent the event going ahead. Due consideration needs to be given  
to legalities – are licences needed? Will insurance be needed? Are permits required  
for various activities etc.? This is the role of the operations screen.  
Events often fall into two operational styles, volunteer or professional \(although  
some have parts of both\). For example, many events, especially in the personal,  
sporting and cultural categories, are run by volunteers. A volunteer committee may  
well consist of people who have had no experience of events before, or who have  
only their own experience and innate good sense to go on.  
On the other hand, there are other events \(particularly organisational, but also  
some sporting, cultural and some personal events\) that are to be professionally run,  
or for which a professional adviser, consultant or Events Management Company  
\(EMC\) has been employed. The level of expertise available is then an issue for  
the operations screen, which indicates what events can be done within the style of  
organisation preferred. However, there are some excellent amateur organisations  
and some very inadequate professional ones \(and vice versa\); there is nothing to  
say that volunteer organisations are necessarily worse off than professional ones in  
putting on events. They may have less experience and \(perhaps\) lesser knowledge  
of what can be achieved, but it should not be assumed that professional organisa-  
tions or companies know everything or will produce a perfect result. Any number  
of things may go wrong, including the professionals not paying sufficient attention  
to the brief or to key issues. Volunteer organisations might be more enthusiastic,  
more resourceful with limited means, and have a better local knowledge than a  
professional events company.  
For events with a volunteer style of organisation and volunteer staff, the matter  
of achievability is important. Does anyone within the organising committee have  
relevant expertise? If so, they must be used to best effect. People with a financial  
background may be best suited to financial issues, people with design backgrounds  
best suited to design issues, and so on. In addition, volunteer organisations should not  
only look at members’ jobs, but also at personal interests\: creative people and good  
organisers are needed for special events. Clues about people’s backgrounds, hobbies,  
interests and expertise need to be sought and could yield useful experience. However,

The aim of this case study is to consider how event idea screening works in an example which  
might be most familiar to students with the following objectives\:  
• To demonstrate the creation and elimination of event ideas.  
• To highlight issues of selection in choosing an event.  
• To understand that this is not a formal process in all events.  
**V** olunteer organisations are extremely common  
in events management. Clubs, societies, asso-  
ciations and charitable bodies often rely on volun-  
teers to run the organisation. Volunteers may have  
little or no training, but do have enthusiasm about  
and dedication to what they are doing. Many people  
have some experience of committee activity and vol-  
untary organisations at college or university, where

clubs and societies dedicated to a whole range of  
sporting, leisure, recreation and special interest activi-  
ties are common. The Hockey Club of University Col-  
lege, Cork, is one such example. Its primary activity  
is playing hockey, but it also has an active social role.  
The Hockey Club is very typical of many clubs  
and societies throughout colleges and universities.  
It plays matches and tournaments and has its own  
webpages within the website of University College,  
Cork. The club has an active social life, with its  
members taking part in a whole range of student  
activities. Its committee organises frequent events,  
both small and \(relatively\) large scale for its members  
and their friends and partners.  
The choices of activities in any academic year  
might produce a list of possible events that include  
a quiz night, a charity horse-race night, a buffet with  
disco, a formal dress ball, an American-style prom,  
the ‘12 pubs of Christmas’ \(a pub-crawl\), dinner  
at a local restaurant or a fancy dress party. As the  
Hockey Club is a relatively informal kind of organisa-  
tion, these choices are bounced around members of  
the committee and the team and their friends. There  
was no complex formal process involved in deciding  
which event to have, only an informal process that  
involved the major stakeholders \(the team and their  
friends\) in the decision-making process. The choice  
reached was the result of a general consensus  
about what event they wanted. For example, in 2016  
this was a formal dress ball, which members of the  
committee, together with a few helpers, organised.  
The kind of process involved here is very typical  
of voluntary organisations and the limited market  
may mean that in-depth research is not required.  
However, the larger and more diverse the market,  
or the more unknown the style of event, the more  
likely will be the need to do a survey, or at least some  
pilot research work, to ensure the event is what the  
market is interested in.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** If you are a member of a club, society or asso-  
ciation, what is the major event in the organi-  
sation’s social calendar?  
**2** How is this event organised and by whom, and  
how are the choices made about what kind of  
event it will be?  
**3** Can the process be said to involve any research  
or confirmation that the event is appropriate?  
**4** If you were the chair of a committee planning  
an event that the public has to pay to attend,  
what steps could you take to ensure your pro-  
posals would meet what the public wants to  
participate in?

volunteering is hard work and not everyone wants to do it. In the end, people may  
not have time to participate in the event, or may be called upon to deal with all kinds  
of occurrences or emergencies that they may not be equipped to cope with.  
Equally important is knowledge of previous activities. Is the event a regular one,  
say, every year, and if so, who knows what has gone on in previous years? However,  
we need to recognise the boundaries of volunteer expertise – the person who has  
attended the annual flower show of a nearby town might be the only one in a volunteer  
organisation who would know anything about how to organise a flower show, but the  
limitations of this approach must be understood. Going to a flower show \(or any other  
event\) as a visitor does not necessarily tell you anything about what goes on behind the  
scenes, how the event was organised or what effort went into putting it on. This is the  
issue of expertise, and when to know you need some. All kinds of special events have  
to start somehow, and the expertise to run them is often built up over many years, or at

least the knowledge about where to obtain the expertise is. This expertise is key when  
issues of health and safety, legality or technology are important to an event.  
The operations screen, then, is all about what can be achieved. From the original  
list it will have been possible to eliminate some of the activities on the basis that  
they are too difficult or complicated, or because there isn’t the time, the staff or an  
appropriate venue. This can be done by using an events screening form \(Figure 5.6\),  
which will help formalise the screening, and several events might be written up in  
order to identify major problems and possible unforeseen issues in terms of licensing,  
regulations and permissions or approvals needed.

# The financial screen  
# break-even  
The point at which  
an event’s costs  
equal the revenue  
received for it.  
Almost all special events will have a budget of some kind, even if that ‘budget’ is only  
an approximate figure of what the organisers or clients can afford, based perhaps  
on similar events. For many events, the financial issues are cost-orientated. For a  
wedding, there is no discernible financial revenue to set against the balance of what  
might have to be spent. In this case, the organisers \(generally the parents of the couple  
to be married and the couple themselves\) will have some idea of how much they can  
afford and if several ideas are being considered \(for example, for the reception\), the  
deciding factor might be the cost.  
Not all events are ‘cost only’; often there is a financial reason for putting an event  
on, such as fundraising or economic regeneration. There are events that are expected  
to make sufficient money to cover costs and **break-even**, or to make a small surplus.  
This is often the case with local volunteer events such as an annual town carnival.  
The carnival committee will be concerned with putting on a good show at a reason-  
able cost and generating enough of a surplus to start next year’s carnival properly.  
Assuming the event has to make money \(say, for fundraising purposes\), or at least  
to cover its costs, then the financial screen is all about identifying which possible  
events from the shortlist could achieve it. Two or three likely events might be com-  
pared using an outline budget. For this to happen, the organisers will need to come  
up with some basic financial information, both in terms of revenue\:  
• How many people attend?  
• What they can be charged?  
• What other ways revenue can be raised during the event? etc.  
Also in terms of costs, the organisers will need to consider the likely costs of\:  
• the location or venue  
• the staffing  
• the materials  
• the decor  
• the consumables  
• the insurance  
• the power  
• the food and drink, etc.  
To assess whether a profit or surplus would be made from this. In some projects,  
especially large-scale ones, there are both capital costs and running costs. Think of  
the Olympics\: the capital costs are about building the facilities, the infrastructure, the  
accommodation, etc. and the running costs are about actually operating the games.  
Will the revenue cover both of these or, in the case of the capital costs, will some other  
benefit be the outcome; could the athletes’ accommodation be turned into flats and  
sold afterwards? Could the stadium replace one that is old and needed replacing any-  
way? Crucially, will the event being planned take place within the appropriate budget?  
In short, the purpose of the financial screen is to take the shortlist of possible  
events, preferably no more than two or three, and prepare an outline budget for each  
one, to help the decision-making process. A little later, as part of the detailed plan-  
ning, the outline budget can be turned into something more detailed and accurate.

# 103  
For care in preparation, an outline budget should attempt to slightly underestimate  
revenues and slightly overestimate costs.  
# Progressing the idea  
In many respects, choosing the event, through the process outlined above, is the  
easy part. The sequence of brainstorming and then filtering ideas to see if an event  
is appropriate can be quite enjoyable. Serious financial and operational feasibility, if  
this were a major project, would then follow from the screening phase. The organ-  
isers or clients would also have some feel for the acceptability of the event, given  
their knowledge of who might be attending. In addition, for any event involving a  
significant budget or complicated organisational issues, a judgement of risks might  
have to be made.  
• How vulnerable is the project financially and operationally?  
• What issues might constitute a risk?  
• Are there factors about licencing, fire, health and safety, crowd control, security,  
hazardous materials or activities that have to be considered?  
It may be possible to find useful information to help with this process from a range  
of sources, not only those published in books and guides, but also from ‘toolkits’ that  
can sometimes be found on events-related websites.  
Having found the preferred concept, the organisers might then wish to review  
the proposal again in the light of the objectives and ask if the proposal still meets  
those objectives \(see Figure 5.7\). It is also quite common for events to have addi-  
tional, subsidiary objectives, such as to educate, or to make money, or to leave a  
useful legacy. To take the idea forward there would have to be some building on  
the initial objectives, with a draft of the proposal containing the overall objective  
broken down into several aims, and then into the component parts for the event.  
Even relatively simple events may have several component parts.

# critical path  
The key time-limited  
route  
through a number  
of time-critical  
activities in the  
planning of an  
event.  
• How will these be put together?  
• Who will be doing the organising and who is responsible for what?  
• Where will the event be held and has more than one venue been approached?  
• When will the event happen and are suitable dates and times available?  
• What materials, supplies and equipment might be needed?  
• What transport, parking or access is available?  
• Why is the time schedule for achieving this important, and what are the deadlines?  
All these questions will have to be answered. More work can be done later, but  
even if this is put into a few pages of notes it will be a useful start, and the plan-  
ning can then be built from the initial ideas. The most important aspect of this  
pre-­ planning phase is to have enough time, not only to work up the detailed plans  
properly, but also to determine whether the event is achievable in the time available.  
In general, volunteer organisations may require more time to deal with complex  
events than professional or full-time organisations, but equally, those professional  
organisations are likely to have a far more realistic appreciation of the amount of  
work involved and the likely time it will take to achieve.  
There may well be a ‘critical path’ of timing issues that will determine whether a  
project or event can be done in the timescale, which the unfamiliar organiser may  
think is easy, but may not be. Consider building projects as an example. Builders are  
often seen as overrunning the time ‘allowed’ for a project, but frequently this is due  
to an unrealistic appreciation of the complexity of the job; the need to get planning  
permission, the logistical problems, the long lead time on deliveries, sourcing unusual  
materials, etc. Much the same is true of special events. An event that might seem very  
simple at first glance can become extremely complicated once someone actually sits  
down to write out all the parts. Nor is there any guarantee that what appears, at first  
sight, to be the ‘**critical path**’ of a project will be so.  
Suppose we are organising a special prize ceremony for the best rose grower in the  
district. The organising committee wants this to get some good local publicity, so has  
decided that the presentation should be made by the mayor in the famous gardens  
of a nearby stately home. Several factors impinge on the timing\: the event needs the  
stately home, the mayor and the local media \(assuming there is to be no other activity  
after the ceremony\). The ‘critical path’ will emerge from one of the three elements\:  
• How long to book the stately home and are the possible dates available?  
• How long it will take to get a slot in the mayor’s busy diary and will this match  
the availability of the stately home?  
• When is a good day for the local media?  
For example, the lead-in to the ‘critical path’ may be the last of these. Not all days are  
good days in media terms. If the local newspaper is published on a Friday, then they  
may be looking for good local stories several days before, probably Monday or Tues-  
day \(not Wednesday or Thursday, as they have to write up a story and get the artwork  
done in time to meet their own print deadline\). This gives a framework for the best  
days on which to do this particular event. In all probability, both the booking of the  
stately home and the mayor’s diary have long lead times, and whichever is longer \(after  
preliminary enquiries\) will have to be done first, as everything else can then follow. As  
a generality, the larger and more complicated an event, the more detailed the planning  
process will need to be and the longer the lead times will be. The key lead time is often  
booking the venue, as popular venues are booked months, sometimes years in advance.

An experienced events organiser will be familiar with those issues that take time to  
get going, and those that can be done quickly. However, for the person who has never  
organised an event before, there is the problem of possibly overlooking something.  
Figure 5.8 gives an initial checklist for various issues and some useful things that  
can be listed at this stage of the event planning process. Nevertheless, all events vary  
in some way and the points shown in the list are not definitive, but are a possible  
source of ideas about what to check and what to do next. The information in the  
checklist, here called the pre-event planner, and of a type also often found in hotel  
‘Banqueting Orders’, is in three main sections. The first deals with contact informa-  
tion, who is organising the event, and basic information about the date and type of  
event. The second deals with information about the possible venue, the event and  
any requirements for refreshments. The third section deals with requirements for the  
layout of the venue, design issues, entertainment and support activities, ranging from  
audio-visual equipment to car parking.  
# The planning process  
The diversity and individuality of events can make them very labour-intensive,  
because of the effort involved in undertaking a non-routine activity. This is not  
simply a matter of how events are operated on the day, but is also a management  
and organisational issue. The management input to any event will be far greater  
than for a routinely manufactured product when management becomes essentially  
a supervisory function based around quality control, once the development phase  
is over, because the manufacturing process is being repeated again and again. Plan-  
ning events, for the uninitiated or for an inexperienced organiser, is therefore rather  
more important and time-consuming than the equivalent processes for repetitive  
goods and services. Taking the example of a wedding, the actual wedding may be  
a ceremony of no more than an hour, followed by a reception and a buffet, but the  
planning may have taken several months and involved large numbers of people –  
families, friends, the venue management, the caterers, the florist, the clothing hire  
company, the musicians, the car company, the religious authority or civil registrar,  
and so on. This complexity of planning is typical of events in general and is part  
of a whole cycle of interrelated activity covering planning, action and control. The  
increased importance of planning is because of its key role in helping to deal with  
the uncertainties of events.  
Planning is the process by which the manager or organiser looks towards the event  
to discover what various courses of action are available to arrange it, and which  
course of action would be the best. This is not to say that a plan is going to appear  
the moment someone sits down to think about it. The manager, organiser or planning  
committee may have run many events, or may have run none \(see Figure 5.9\).  
The advantage of having done it before is not only the experience, but also the  
existence of records and previous plans. On the other hand, with a new event, the  
plan to start with may be no more than a vague hunch or an organiser’s intuition  
about what might be appropriate. However, this can be worked up very quickly into  
something more useful and relevant; a plan is essentially a predetermined course of  
action based on given objectives.  
The objectives have to be carefully thought through, and be precise and clear  
enough to ensure that the purpose of the event is obvious to all those involved in it,  
from the chair of the organising committee or clients, down to staff or volunteers at

the operational level. Clarity at the beginning also helps the planning process and  
getting everyone to pull in the same direction. The objectives should not be too com-  
plicated, perhaps consisting of only one or two primary objectives, although these  
can be broken down into a number of detailed aims; but preferably not more than  
six, otherwise the point may be obscured, and simplicity is best at this stage.  
# Objectives, environmental search  
# and information-GAthering  
The objectives are the starting point for the planning of any event – what is the event  
intended to do? Is it intended to celebrate, to entertain, to fundraise? Given this, and  
some view of the feasibility of the event after the screening process, the organisers  
should have a reasonable idea of the kind of event that can be put on and whether  
it will suit the type of people coming to it \(the target market\). However, planning  
should not be seen as something that starts with a concept and ends on the opening  
hour. Even after the event has started the organiser is likely to be making changes,  
sometimes very major changes, in response to problems or to deal with an unforeseen  
crisis. One of the purposes of planning is to visualise potential problems and to have  
a plan that will take into account the environment of the event, the stakeholders, the  
circumstances in which the event is taking place and what might go wrong; or put  
more simply, there will need to be some contingency planning for emergencies, in  
addition to the main plan itself.  
From the bare bones, an outline plan can be drawn up \(see Figure 5.10\), perhaps  
by brainstorming around the event idea and then listing the issues identified. This  
basic draft can then be added to in a more systematic way by the organising com-  
mittee and its advisers and helpers to cover headings such as operations, finance and  
marketing. This can include an ‘environmental search and information-gathering’

# CASE STUDY  
# 18  
# Environmental searching\: the reopening of the Scottish Parliament  
# David Gee 1/Alamy Stock Photo  
# Parliament Chambers, Scottish Parliament  
# Edinburgh, Scotland  
FACTBOX  
• Reopening of the Scottish Parliament, Edinburgh  
• First parliament in Edinburgh for almost 300 years  
• Ceremony combined old and new elements  
• Parliament opened by Queen Elizabeth  
• ‘The Scottish Parliament, which adjourned on 17th March 1707, is hereby  
reconvened’  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the issues which impinge on the environment \(in this case  
the political and cultural environment\) in which an event operates with the following objectives\:  
• To consider why local knowledge or understanding might affect the success or failure of an event.  
• To understand the issues which an event organiser or committee might have to take into  
account when planning an event of a sensitive nature.  
**O** n 1st of July 1999, the Scottish Parliament  
met for the first time in almost 300 years. It  
had been abolished after the joining of Scotland  
and England had removed political power from  
Edinburgh in 1707 and made Westminster the only  
UK parliament. The re-establishment of Scotland’s  
parliament was greeted with considerable enthusi-  
asm in Scotland.

# The environment and circumstances  
# of the planning stage  
In Scotland the nature of the opening of the par-  
liament was a matter of some controversy during  
the preparations. There was a feeling that the cere-  
mony would be too short and modern, and that the  
event would fail to include the heraldic flag-bearers  
of Scotland, who are traditionally associated with  
royal Scottish ceremonial events. In public, the rea-  
son given for the absence of the flag-bearers was  
that the ceremony needed to be modern, but the  
scathing publicity in the Scottish media about their  
absence suggests that the organising committee  
was taken by surprise.  
The organising committee initially failed in two  
ways\: first, it had insufficient experience of Scottish  
public feeling, and second, it had not undertaken  
a proper environmental search. It was thought that  
the committee originally had no idea of Scottish  
traditions because the reform had been initiated in  
London and the committee’s ‘starting point’ had  
been London, not Edinburgh. There was, therefore,  
little recognition \(due to inexperience and inade-  
quate research\) that a Scottish parliamentary tradi-  
tion existed, let alone how it had worked. However,  
the committee \(fortunately\) listened very closely to  
public opinion in Scotland and these issues were  
addressed carefully and in time.  
# The stakeholders  
The people and groups most concerned with the  
opening were its organising committee, the politi-  
cal parties \(notably the Labour Party, under whom  
the reform had been promoted, but other parties  
as well, including the Scottish National Party\),  
Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Household, the  
Scottish Office \(a government department\), the  
national and local media, the people of Scotland,  
the army \(as escort to the royal family\), the ­ Heralds  
and ceremonial officers of Scotland, The Duke of  
Hamilton \(as Scotland’s senior lord, responsible  
for the crown jewels of Scotland\) and a very large  
number of people and groups involved in the cer-  
emony, such as the orchestra, schoolchildren,  
poets, and so on.  
The outcome was an event that was very well  
received. In the modern \(and then temporary cham-  
ber\) of the Church of Scotland, the ceremony was  
opened with a fanfare played by the Royal Scottish  
National Orchestra, following which the Royal Pro-  
cession entered with the Duke of Hamilton carrying  
the Scottish crown on a purple velvet cushion, fol-  
lowed by the Queen, and then the Lord Lyon King  
of Arms and the Heralds \(‘more Heralds than were  
needed to put on a Hollywood movie’, the newspa-  
pers reported\). This was followed by the opening  
speeches, some poetry and spontaneous singing  
by the Scottish MPs.  
The ceremony was hailed as a major success,  
not only in style but also in tone. It celebrated the  
need to open a modern parliament, and recalled  
the traditional way in which the old parliament, 300  
years before, had been opened, thus fulfilling its  
objectives.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Why is finding out about the environment and  
circumstances of your event important?  
**2** How can you identify the stakeholders \(those  
people and groups that would take part or be  
interested in some way\) for an event?  
**3** Why is doing this important, and what might  
happen if you do not identify them all?  
**4** Why is clarity of objectives key to running a suc-  
cessful event, and were the objectives for this  
event clear from the start?  
**5** What is ‘tone’ and why may it be important in  
an event, particularly cultural, political or social  
events?

phase, a part of the process that involves collecting information relevant to the  
event. Facts such as available dates, suitable times, potential venues and useful  
staff have to be identified; checking has to take place to ensure there are no clashes  
with other, similar or competitor events. For major events, checking what else is  
taking place, or is planned, can also be done using online listing services as well  
as by methods such as looking at magazine or newspaper event listings \(checking  
the same time in the previous year’s reports is also useful in doing this\) and if the  
prospective market is not known, market research should be done into what people  
would like and pay for, building on any pilot research that might have been carried  
out at the screening stage.  
The draft plan is really a place for initial ideas to be recorded, a kind of scrap-box  
for brainstorming and all your initial thoughts and concepts. Its headings should,  
importantly, cover six key issues, to give it some structure and form\:  
• Why the event is being undertaken?  
• Who will be involved in the process and the event \(and who may not be\)?  
• What will take place and what information or research is needed to make  
decisions?  
• How will it be done?  
• Where will it happen \(including the main location and any additional locational  
needs\)?  
• When will it take place \(including dates and expected outline times\)?  
This is part of the mechanism, like the screening process, by which an organiser  
seeks to identify potential problems at an early stage. Once all the ideas and informa-  
tion have been ‘thrown in’, the plan can then be reorganised to give it some proper  
structure. Always keep the first drafts, though, as sometimes they contain material  
that might be thought of as not very important, until, nearer the event, a problem  
of some kind emerges.  
In many ways the environmental search/information-gathering process is also a  
search for opportunities \(as well as problems\). For example, another event in the  
same area and of the same type as your event might be seen as competitive, but could  
be complementary. The organiser, or in the case of a very large event, a professional  
researcher, will be looking for\:  
• information about demand for the event and the capacity of the market  
• any competition  
• availability of technology, equipment and supplies  
• financing and sponsorship  
• organisations and the availability of staff  
• local cultural or social issues and precedents, and  
• time issues in planning.  
This information can then be included \(or put aside\) and helps the organisers to  
plan and identify what else is needed, but assists also in the organisation and running  
of the event. Sometimes, however, the process of ‘environmental searching’ is not  
properly done and results in some major problems or mistakes which embarrass the  
organisers \(see Figure 5.11\).

# 113  
# Operational planning and demand  
For some events, the issue of demand may not seem directly relevant, and for per-  
sonal events in particular it might be thought that demand is not a significant factor  
in the planning process, except to know roughly how many people are coming or will  
be invited to an event, such as a wedding or birthday party. \(Yet even for personal  
events, some checking is needed. You might invite 100 people to your party, but this  
does not mean 100 people are going to turn up.\) For almost all events, demand and  
the potential market are an issue. General public events can be difficult to plan for.  
• What sort of people are interested?  
• How many might attend?  
• When would be a good date or time to put the event on?  
It can be difficult to assess this effectively, especially when no similar event has  
been run before. On the other hand, with many types of events, the potential number  
of attendees may be quite specific, or specific enough for the event manager to get  
a feel for the requirements. This can be checked by some research, either informally  
such as ‘talking to the locals’, or by formal surveys and questionnaires.  
Suppose we were organising a fancy dress party for a university. We might already  
know a number of things about the market – the age group, the total number of stu-  
dents, their inclination to dress up, and so on. However, there may be a number of  
other factors to consider, especially about the date or timing of the event. If it is to be in  
the evening, then the total market may not be all the students attending the university,  
but only be the ones who live at the university, and then only those who have not yet  
made plans for the suggested date. Therefore, judging attendance becomes a fine art  
and both experience and research are needed to get it right. From an assessment of the  
whole market, the potential total of attendees and the timing, various other factors can  
then be considered. The competition may be significant as more than one event may  
be taking place around the planned date. There may be a gig in town or the University  
Rugby Club may also be planning its annual party. As a consequence, the timing of the  
event may become a key factor in ensuring maximum take-up of tickets \(by avoiding  
the dates of the other events\). In addition, searching the environment for other timing  
issues may still be needed, on the basis of other things taking place such as examina-  
tions or revision, another important local attraction, a big event on television, like the  
Tour de France or Formula 1 motor racing, or the launch of a major new film at the  
cinema. Also, importantly, whether there is a finance-related timing issue; the students  
may be better off at the start of term than at the end of it \(but might still want to end  
with a good time\). Comparative issues can be seen from this example, even in the case  
of public events. If a public event is perceived as expensive then it may be appropriate  
to schedule it only at a vacation time when discretionary income may be available, or  
when there are tourists around, or at a time of the month when many people get paid.  
Moving onto some of the detailed issues of the planning process, the event will  
require a whole range of resources. It is easy to regard these resources as simply  
being staff and equipment, however, in practice, the single most important resource  
for event managers is time, because the brief for an event may allow only a very  
limited timescale. The brief \(which is a specification or contract for an event, some-  
times given by companies or organisers\) may not allow a realistic timescale to get  
everything done properly without incurring very high costs for staffing, resources  
needed and management time. Professional event managers may turn down some

briefs on this basis. There has to be enough time to plan the event properly, to meet  
deadlines and **cut-off points**, and to achieve the set-up, run the event and break down  
its various elements afterwards.  
Event managers therefore need to be aware of key timing issues. The lead times  
of various event-related activities are often underestimated; hence the difficulty of  
getting a large number of tickets out for the Millennium Dome. But there are many  
other lead-time issues, from marketing and the production of brochures to the lead  
time of booking the right venue. Many venues will be booked up well over a year  
in advance. Popular dates and times of year often take the uninitiated by surprise  
and almost the first activity in planning will be to identify suitable venues and dates.  
Bookings can be made provisionally but will usually be subject to a deposit, even  
if the venue is the village hall. For events that are self-funding this may result in a  
chicken-and-egg type problem; what to do first, confirm the venue or sell tickets?  
This is usually resolved by having a cut-off date by which the event will be confirmed,  
and the venue paid for by selling a limited number of tickets early on. If cancelled,  
no money is lost before the booking **cut-off date** and it can then be returned to those  
who booked early \(see Figure 5.12\).

# Financial planning  
The plan should now be starting to have some shape. The organisers should have  
been able to quantify the size of the event – how many people are coming, whether  
there is any competition or synergy and whether the event is convenient in relation  
to this. Identifying similar events may also have given some feel for the prices people  
are willing to pay. However, price should not be determined by other events, but by  
what it will cost to put on your event and whether it has to be profitable \(the issue of  
budgeting is dealt with in more detail later\). This issue of pricing is very important,  
as inexperienced organisers typically underestimate the various costs. It is absolutely  
essential to sit down and list all the items required and cost them properly\: ‘a few  
balloons’ may turn into a budget for decorations of several hundreds of euros.  
There is a tendency on the part of everyone to say, ‘Oh well, it will cost about . . .’  
without checking. When someone does get around to checking, the real amount  
comes as a terrible shock. A good example is discos\: someone on the organising  
committee always ‘has a mate’ who ‘does a disco’ and it will be ‘really cheap’. No,  
it won’t. The ‘mate’ will take various liberties with the organisers who will find  
out, afterwards, that they could have had a cheaper disco locally. The other serious  
mistake is for organisers to start off with a ticket price they have picked out of thin  
air, ‘I think tickets should be . . .’ This method, based on no reasoning whatsoever,  
is almost guaranteed to land the event in serious financial difficulties. If you decide  
the ticket price before the costing has been done, you end up cutting back on all the  
things that make the event special. The ticket price has to be based on accurate cost-  
ings and only then considered in the light of competition and what the market will  
pay \(which should if possible be based on some realistic data\). A further financial  
issue that should be included with the budget and cash flow statement is a calculation  
about the break-even point of the event. For example, say ticket prices are €10 and  
costs are €500. For the event to break-even, this means that 50 tickets have to be  
sold. What if the venue only seats 45? You couldn’t make a profit. In essence, once  
the full costs of the event are known, the ticket price can be calculated, bearing in  
mind that enough tickets have to be sold to cover all eventualities.

There are other hidden-cost risks involved in event management. Break-down  
and bottleneck costs can be very severe and not apparent until they occur. The tick-  
eting problems of the Millennium Dome could be thought of as having break-down  
costs, with there being not only negative financial outcomes, such as having to pay  
compensation for the break-down, and also the costs of damage to the company’s  
reputation, which might turn out to be so severe that the company may not recover.  
These failure costs can be thought of as falling into three categories\:  
• cost risks related to quality management and standards  
• cost risks related to the expense of putting on the event  
• costs risks related to the effective timing and scheduling of events.

FACTBOX  
• Millennium Dome, Greenwich, England  
• Cost\: in excess of £1,200 million  
• The Dome contained 14 zones  
• Much of the cost was covered by companies sponsoring the Dome and by  
­ Lottery grants  
• The opening night was reported as a disaster  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the failures which contributed to the perceived shambles  
of the opening night ceremony of the Millennium Dome with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the background to the ceremony.  
• To highlight the issues which contributed to the problem.  
• To understand why a large organisation failed to react to the problem.  
**T** he Millennium Dome, at Greenwich in London,  
took three years to build. The total cost of the  
building and its operations was some £1,200 million.  
It was opened at a ceremony scheduled to run into  
the early hours of the morning of 1st January 2000.  
Originally, the Dome was the culmination of a  
plan to celebrate a Christian \(religious\) event for  
2000\. Initially it was thought that Birmingham, in the  
English Midlands, would be the site. However, as  
the idea began to be adopted by the government,  
the concept changed from being religious \(once the  
site was selected as Greenwich in east ­ London\),  
to having the purpose of regenerating a large  
area of derelict land on the Greenwich peninsula,

overlooking the River Thames. In this form it was  
intended to be a trade exhibition, rather like the  
Festival of Britain of 1951 and its forerunners like  
the Paris Exposition of 1889, but the idea gradually  
changed from this to an exhibition celebrating ‘time’  
and the phases of life as its theme. The final out-  
come was the ‘Dome’, containing 14 zones, such  
as the mind zone, the journey zone, the home planet  
zone, etc., representing various life experiences.  
Each zone attracted sponsorship from national and  
international companies; for example, Ford spon-  
sored the journey zone with almost £19.5 million  
of support, it was reported by the *Daily Telegraph*  
*Magazine* at the time.  
The opening ceremony, despite every intention to  
make the event successful, was a shambles of hap-  
hazard ticketing, ineptly managed security and the  
unfortunate late arrival of guests. The results were not  
only tremendous stress and anger on the night itself,  
amongst those struggling to get to the event, but also  
massive public relations damage to the image of the  
Dome and to the organising company. The cause of  
this shambles was inadequate planning and a lack of  
awareness on the part of the New Millennium Expe-  
rience Company \(NMEC\), of scheduling, especially  
of the ticketing, together with the apparent lack of a  
thought-out timescale for the activities of ticket pro-  
cessing and security checks. Ten thousand people  
had been invited to the opening ceremony. A few days  
before the event, only just over half the tickets had  
been sent out. At this point, it was discovered that  
there would not be enough time to post the remaining  
tickets to the invited guests \(in 2000 ­ cellphone and  
internet ticketing was not yet developed\). The prob-  
lem was compounded by a lack of a sense of urgency  
that this was a major material issue that, if not handled  
well, would cause serious damage.  
NMEC showed no apparent significant mana-  
gerial concern about the ticketing problem until the  
issue began to appear in the newspapers a few  
days before, by which time it was too late to get the  
tickets out. Consequently, guests were told to get  
themselves to Stratford underground railway station  
in east London on the night, where special arrange-  
ments would be made to get them onto the Tube  
\(London’s metro\), which was running special trains to  
the Dome station at Greenwich. The Dome had been  
designed with almost no car parking and access was  
by public transport only; this poor infrastructure was  
a major cause of low visitor numbers. Indeed, desig-  
nated parking was often at car parks that were major  
public transport hubs, such as Luton Airport, some  
70 km from the Dome. \(In August 2000, after the  
Dome had further grants and loans of over €100 mil-  
lion, in addition to its original costs, and with continu-  
ing low visitor numbers, a car park with a capacity of  
1,000 car parking spaces was opened at the Dome  
site, too late to save the peak summer season.\)  
The opening ceremony was to be performed by  
Queen Elizabeth, together with the Prime Minister  
and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and with a large  
number of VIPs present, and there was to be tight  
security. In practice this meant that every guest was  
supposed to walk through an electronic security gate.  
The impact of 4,000 people turning up at the Strat-  
ford underground station, where there were four secu-  
rity gates \(only one of which was working properly\),  
had not been adequately thought about or properly  
checked. As the 4,000 ticketless but invited guests  
began to turn up at Stratford, in their best evening  
wear, dinner jackets and ball gowns, the outcome was  
complete chaos. In no way could 4,000 people get  
through one gate, and this presented a major issue.

As the situation deteriorated and with an appar-  
ent blasé attitude on the part of the NMEC manage-  
ment, most of whom were already at the Dome and  
could not understand the magnitude of the chaos at  
Stratford, partly due to the filtering effect of layers of  
management and limited communications, as well  
as the distance, some efforts were made to get the  
guests to the Dome in time for the main ceremony,  
scheduled for midnight. Special buses were brought  
in, and eventually attempts at ‘security’ were aban-  
doned, in an effort to get people to the Dome. By  
10.40 pm, when the 4,000 unfortunate guests were

at last beginning to arrive, all the food and drink  
\(including 10,000 bottles of champagne\) had been  
either consumed or removed, and further chaos  
ensued whilst people tried to find their seats. In this  
maelstrom the atmosphere of happiness intended  
for the evening was largely ruined, although the cer-  
emony went ahead.  
The following day, the managing director of  
the NMEC dismissed the chaos as unimport-  
ant. Unfortunately for the company, amongst the  
4,000 invited guests who had been put through  
the chaos at Stratford were several national news-  
paper editors and their wives, the Director-general  
of the BBC and a number of the major sponsors.  
The company and the event were savaged in the  
media, and, together with the government, had to  
apologise. Within a month, and partly due to ‘lower  
than expected attendances’ at the Dome, the chief  
executive of the NMEC had been replaced. This  
was the price of inattention to detail in planning and  
a lack of conviction in management – for exam-  
ple, to avoid jokes about Disney, the NMEC had  
avoided seeking advice from the amusement park  
industry, which had the necessary experience of  
large-scale outdoor events. The new chief exec-  
utive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, appointed after the  
disaster, was from Disney in Europe and an expert  
in visitor park attractions and ticketing. The Dome  
closed in December 2000 and the post-event  
divestment of the site has had all the hallmarks  
of its dubious pre-event planning. Eventually, after  
several false starts, the Dome was bought by tele-  
coms company O2 and redeveloped into The O2  
arena. It reopened in June 2007 and is used for  
music, entertainment and sporting events of all  
kinds. During the 2012 Olympics it was tempo-  
rarily stripped of its sponsoring branding and was  
known as the North Greenwich Arena due to Olym-  
pic regulations, but reverted to its branded name  
afterwards and now, in 2018, it is most commonly  
known, simply, as the O2.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Identify the key mistakes that NMEC made  
in its organisation of the opening night of the  
Dome. What are the likely background rea-  
sons for these mistakes?  
**2** What new management tools or systems, used  
in event management, would have prevented  
the initial ticketing failure?  
**3** How did the shambles of the opening night  
impact on the public and media image of the  
Dome as an attraction?  
**4** Was this the only reason for lower than expected  
visitors to the Dome, or did the Dome have  
infrastructure and content problems as well?

A tension exists between these issues. For example, for the quality of an event  
to be assured, both adequate time and money have to be put in; if this is not done,  
the outcome may not be as intended. This was the case with the Dome’s opening  
night. There was the failure of not having planned enough time and given enough  
resources \(such as expertise, management and staffing\) to dispatch 4,000 tickets. The  
breakdown resulted in a quality failure and a cost failure \(the simple cost in terms of  
getting people to the Dome by special buses, and the severe and complex cost after-  
wards of the public relations damage\). What action could have been taken to deal  
with the problem is open to debate, but it should have been possible, for example, to  
courier tickets out to more than one location for distribution; to arrange for people  
to meet at more than one place for their onward transport, as well as to have more

than one operating security gate at these different locations. Doing this would have  
cost money to sort out, quite a lot of money. But it would have saved the reputation  
of the NMEC. The lesson is to pay enough attention to the services being provided  
for the event and what the participants or guests are saying. In doing so, the cost of  
solving a problem as it develops may be less than the cost of trying to put the damage  
right afterwards.  
One of the further issues in terms of financial planning may be related to legacies.  
Any legacy of an event may have to be planned from the start. Event legacies are  
not common for all events; small and personal events don’t always tend to have  
legacies, but some large-scale, national or international events do have legacies \(see  
Chapter 12\). These may have major financial implications; indeed it might not be  
possible to put on an event such as the Olympics without there being a significant  
legacy\: what would be the point of spending hundreds of millions on three weeks of  
sport unless there were a long-term more permanent gain to be obtained. On a lesser  
scale this may be true of other kinds of events. The legacy from a village flower show  
might be that enough money is made to provide flowers or flower baskets around  
the village for the summer; if so, then the financial implication of the legacy has to  
be considered in the planning process\: how much money is needed for the legacy as  
well as to run the event again annually? If you want a legacy for an event, it must be  
realistic and achievable – too heavy a financial burden on the event might mean that  
it doesn’t make enough money to cover both its costs and the cost of the proposed  
legacy – so you will have collapsed the event by asking too much of it.

# mArketing planning  
All events require marketing planning. We might think some events that are not intended  
as public activities \(such as those for our immediate family and friends\), might not need  
marketing. But think what you do when you invite your friends to a party – you want  
to make it sound good so people will come, so you are, in effect, doing some marketing.  
The issue of how to market an event does become significant, even if we are only ‘mar-  
keting’ within a group of friends or neighbours or to a small organisation, rather than to  
the public as a whole. Arguably, we are looking at several marketing-related activities\:  
research \(if a public event\: who is our market? What will they pay? What are their inter-  
ests? How will they get to us? etc.\); internal marketing, within the organisation, both  
in respect of the people involved in preparing the event and in respect of those people  
within the organisation whom the event would be for; and/or external marketing, for  
public events or events where some external public relations would be a benefit.  
Assuming the event organisers wish to obtain some publicity or public relations  
coverage, it is necessary to plan the marketing activities that would produce this.  
For some kinds of activities, such as product launches, the budget available for pro-  
moting the event might be very large indeed. For other events, such as a village fête,  
there might be a modest budget, so the marketing for it might have to be based on  
effective public relations rather than on advertising or expensive promotional tools.  
In working up a marketing plan, the event organiser will have to identify what the  
available budget is. There are essentially two ways of doing this. One way is to say,  
well, here is the income, marketing can have so much \(after which the marketing  
team will take fright and probably have to see what they can get for limited money\).  
The other, more preferable, way is to look at the event objectives and work up a  
marketing budget based on what needs to be done.

The next stage will be planning the marketing effort in terms of time. We can  
call this a marketing action plan, or even a launch plan. It is a schedule of activities  
leading up to the event \(other activities may take place afterwards, such as getting  
pictures of the event in the local newspapers\). The marketing team will need to iden-  
tify the key lead times for each activity. Suppose a printed programme is required. It  
will be important to find out not only how long it will take to collect the informa-  
tion to include, but also how long the programme will take to print; how long to be  
proofread and checked; and how long to be delivered. Many marketing teams have  
come unstuck with programmes or brochures because a vital piece of information  
is not ready\:  
‘Oh yes, the committee is meeting next week to decide that.’  
‘But we need to get the programme proof to the printer today.’  
‘Oh sorry, you’ll just have to wait.’  
‘But it takes six weeks to print . . .’  
In consequence, the key to the marketing programme is to allow enough time and to  
know who is making relevant decisions and when. Things that often appear simple  
are not, or take much longer than expected. Comments such as\:  
‘I rang up the radio station to tell them about tomorrow’s fireworks . . . they  
said they needed to know three weeks ago, in order to get it into the right  
schedule’ are very typical for the inexperienced organiser.  
It is essential to find out, genuinely, how long marketing and public relations matters  
will take, and then to plan accordingly.  
There are many lead-time issues that relate to the marketing function. These may  
include\:  
• printing of tickets, posters, menus, programmes, banners, etc.  
• ordering of equipment, often the more specialised the longer the lead time  
• advertising and promotion, even local radio may need two or three weeks noti-  
fication of an event to ensure it is given good coverage  
• liaison issues, where relevant, with police, highways departments, health  
and safety, and so on, especially where large numbers of the public may be  
attending.  
In essence, the longer the lead time before an event the better, although this is not to  
say it is impossible to put on an event very quickly, but to do so may need profes-  
sional help or may result in higher costs.  
We might argue that some types of marketing, especially viral marketing through  
social media are very fast, but the use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Linke-  
dIn, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on are not the simple solution they may seem to be  
for all issues. They need to be considered in terms of their strengths and weaknesses  
in just the same way as conventional paid media or advertising. Firstly, social media  
may be very useful for personal events or social events which take place in a hurry or  
on the spur of the moment, but most events are not of this type, and consequently the  
use of social media may best be as one element of the wider marketing mix and for  
activities such as the inclusion of participants in planning or revising events to create  
added value, that is to say activities such as the co-creation of events. Secondly, social  
media has a tendency to reveal nasty surprises to inexperienced marketing personnel

and even experienced managers. What your organisation might have thought was  
the best idea since the invention of the wheel might expose you to ridicule or insult,  
because it’s not such a good idea and people are resistant to it. Social media has a  
tendency to allow people to feedback information instantly and if you are disliked,  
or your event is lousy, or if your organisation has a bad reputation then social media,  
whether it is through Facebook status or through the use of the **backchannel** at an  
event, is likely to tell you this very quickly \(and possibly in a way you didn’t expect or  
don’t like\) \(Hudson et al., 2015\). Social media, therefore, is another tool in the box of  
tools which can be used as part of your marketing or public relations plan and should  
be considered just as carefully and ethically as any other part of it.

# Getting it together  
At the point at which the organisers have gathered all the information, written the  
plans and sorted out the major issues, there should be a pause. This may happen  
naturally between the planning and the event, or it may have to be built in. The  
pause is needed because there should be time to reflect on the progress of planning  
the event so far, to check the status of the plans; also, time is needed for discussion  
and feedback and for people and organisations to respond. This is one of those points  
when everyone should meet to see what else has been done, to discuss what still  
needs to be achieved and to participate in further arrangements and final checking.  
Organisers must handle this phase sensitively. It is not necessarily there for them to  
tell people what will be done but is to jointly and openly explore progress, and is a  
key characteristic of good events planning\: an opportunity to pause and listen.  
Throughout this process, the event will be getting closer and closer. There will  
be deadlines to deal with, and in due course the event will take place. With careful  
planning, modest \(or major\) success should be the result. After that, a short ‘wash-up’  
session should take place, for feedback on the event, to write up the accounts, com-  
plete the records and make any notes of importance to the planning of a similar  
event in the future.

# Summary  
**A** t the beginning of the feasibility phase, a large number of ideas  
or concepts for an event may have been identified. These  
various ideas could then be put through a series of screens\: marketing,  
operational and financial, whose purpose is to filter out those ideas that  
were not really viable. Having done this, the organisers should have a  
limited number of events to choose from; it is even possible that just one  
event may have made it. In fact, if the process is done in a very formal  
way, against set criteria for each part, there might be no ideal outcome,  
only the ‘nearest fit’. Where there is more than one possible event, the  
objectives can be looked at again and if there is still more than one event  
on the shortlist, choose the one that would be most enjoyable!  
Planning, and the planning process, plays a key role in the organisation  
and management of special events. It is a tool that organisers can use  
effectively or, sometimes, badly. Even the simplest of events, such as a  
birthday or dinner party, will need to be planned, or at least given some  
forethought. The larger and more complex events become, the more  
detailed and systematic the planning will have to be. Care, time and  
effort at the planning stage of an event will yield many benefits, the most  
important of which is ensuring the most positive outcome for the event.

# 125  
# Introduction  
Financial planning and good financial control are important aspects of the event man-  
agement process. Even if we are only organising a small personal event, we need to  
know how much can be spent. For the vast majority of events, there will be both income  
and expenditure. The careful monitoring, recording and control of these incomes and  
expenditures is a significant concern of clients, organisers, coordinators and finance  
officers of all kinds. For the professional finance officer, this chapter will seem a very  
general outline of what has to be done, but for the person new to the job of volunteer  
treasurer or financial officer of an event, it should prove a helpful starting point. As such,  
the purpose of the chapter is not to deal with the entire financial management subject  
related to the area; for this the reader may wish to look at Jagels and Ralston \(2010\) or  
similar texts. The recording of the financial aspects of events, ranging from the purchase  
of items to the final budgeted accounts, is potentially much more complicated than  
the summary here. Good financial control is important to the success of events, even  
those not intended to be profit making, but there are many useful accountancy practice  
books and considerable software available for those who wish to expand their expertise.  
For events that are revenue generating, as well as those where the recording of  
outgoings against a client’s budget is needed, we can begin to see the necessity of  
normal accounting processes, rather than simply being able to list the costs on a  
sheet of paper. Even the Scouts of Middleburg with their car wash fundraising idea  
can serve to illustrate the fact that events exist whose primary purpose is to make  
money with a minimum expenditure \(a few buckets of warm water, some sponges  
and a large number of happy Scouts being all that is needed\), but it is still essential to  
know what money has been made. So, while we might have events that are entirely  
cost-oriented on the one hand, or entirely income-oriented on the other, there are a  
very large number of events that require both these things and have to be financially  
managed in a conventional way, with careful assessment of potential income, expen-  
diture and profit, surplus or break-even, depending on the type of event.  
In all cases, some effort needs to go into providing an overview of the financial  
aspects of the event, both at the planning stage, during the event itself and at the end.  
In the case of the wedding or the Scouts’ car wash, this might simply comprise a list  
of what has been spent or what has been made \(it is better to do two lists – of what is  
planned and what actually happened – both forecast and actual\). Clearly, if the wedding  
was planned to cost €5,000, but €10,000 was spent, someone had to find the money.  
Equally, if the Scouts planned to raise €1,000 from washing cars but raised only €500,  
then perhaps the new roof and redecoration of their hut might have to be reduced to the  
new roof. The function of financial control is to tell us what happened, but it also takes  
place before and during an event. Beforehand, a budget will be needed so the organisers  
can judge whether the event is likely to be a success in financial terms, and afterwards  
as a guide to see whether the event could be judged successful against its financial  
objectives. Additionally, we will look at ways in which the potential income for an event  
could be increased, and also at the public funding of events and sponsorship.  
# Objectives and financial planning  
The setting of objectives is important for the entire event and is also the key to what  
has to be done financially. Event organisers may be faced with a range of financial  
choices depending on what has been decided about the objectives \(see Chapter 5,

about the financial screening process\). Care, time and effort will need to be taken  
at an early stage to ensure good financial management, and that all the possible  
kinds of expenditure and income have been identified. Small personal events, whose  
objective is simply the enjoyment of the participants, may have little in the way of  
financial management, except an awareness of the potential spend in the most gen-  
eral terms. For very large events on a regional, national or international scale, the  
financial aspects may have to become the subject of financial feasibility studies based  
on a range of possible techniques, from cost–benefit analysis to assessing the tourism  
multiplier of a total event project. Such techniques are, however, rather beyond the  
boundaries of this book and we will concentrate on the more common aspects of  
financial management in terms of budgeting and control, which are appropriate for  
the popular range of events.  
One key to the effective financial management of events is the appointment of  
someone responsible for it, in the same way that members of an organising committee  
might be responsible for bookings, organisation, staff and marketing. It is rather typ-  
ical of events \(particularly those that rely on volunteer staffing, as many do\) for their  
financial aspects to be relatively poorly understood, especially in terms of cashflow  
\(that is, the relative timing of income and expenditure\). Many events organisers do  
not fully appreciate the financial implications of the decisions they are making and  
are consequently surprised, when the accounts are done, how little profit has been  
made or how big a loss has been incurred. Even apparently unrelated decisions can  
have a major impact on revenue. A good example might be the timing of an event. If  
this decision is wrong, and perhaps the event clashes with a similar one at the same  
time, then the target market might not be able to attend both, with a consequent  
loss of ticket sales, income and other revenue, which may result in a forecast profit  
becoming an actual loss. For this reason, a numerate and capable person should be  
appointed to oversee the accounts.  
It is also useful to understand the links between the original setting of the objec-  
tives and to follow those through into the financial management and budgets. It  
is no good saying in the objectives \(as in the example in Figure 6.1\), that a key  
objective is to raise enough money ‘to rebuild the city stadium’, if it is not known  
how much that would cost, and whether the budget for the event will actually be  
able to cope with it. Similarly, it is no good saying that the objective for a wedding  
is to spend less than €5,000, if this is not properly written into the budget, or if  
someone goes out and blows €4,500 on the pre-wedding party, leaving only €500  
for the whole of the actual wedding \(‘Oh, nobody told me we only had €5,000’\). The  
objectives and the financial management are intimately linked. It is essential that  
the organisers make the links clear – remember the SMART acronym\: the budget  
is about measuring.  
Cashflow issues also tend to be serious, particularly for events that involve  
pre-booking, such as a fundraising dinner. Some expenditure or investment may well  
have to take place before any income is generated or tickets sold, thus exposing the  
organisers to risk of financial failure. Venues for events often have long lead times  
for bookings and require money up front to hold or confirm the booking. When this  
is the case, the treasurer \(or finance officer of the organising committee\) will have to  
ensure sufficient money is available to pay for the various costs before the deadlines,  
or risk losing the booking and the event. This will mean careful attention to issues  
such as debt collection and credit periods. For example, if an agent has agreed to take  
a certain number of advance tickets for an event, when do you, as finance officer of  
the event, get paid for them? If the period between booking the tickets and payment

a booking fee. Suppose these booking fees add up to €1,000. The capacity of the  
marquee is 250, and the booking deadline is the end of June. In a very basic way, the  
financial manager will either have to find €1,000 from existing funds \(if the event  
has been run before and generated a surplus in previous years\), or, in the case of  
there being no existing funds, would have to get 250 deposits of €4 per person \(or  
equivalent\) to cover the booking costs by, say, a week before the end of June, to have  
a chance of the event running; or funds from other methods, such as sponsorship,  
donations or borrowing \(e.g. a bank loan, bearing in mind that this would have to be  
repaid with interest, probably against some form of security\). This might be only the  
first of several financial deadlines and serves to illustrate that cashflow and deadlines  
could mean the difference between whether an event runs or not.  
# Creating a budget  
In commercial organisations, senior management or a head of department might do  
the preparation of a budget for an event. However, in the case of many events, run by  
volunteers, committees, individuals or families, who may have no experience of how  
to make an event work in financial terms, the preparation of a budget might involve  
several people, or a volunteer with some financial or organisational background  
suited to the task. For the person new to the financial aspects of running an event,  
the planning of a budget may not be as easy as it first appears, since a great deal of  
information has to be collected, and many new techniques learned, which might not  
be obvious at the start. However, the time and effort put into careful preparation of  
a budget is extremely important to the success of the event, and to the financial and  
general control of what is going on \(see Figure 6.3\).  
Figure 6.3 Some common budgeting mistakes  
# •  
Ignoring the objectives of the event when setting the budget.  
• Plucking a figure out of the air for ticket sales before finding out how much the event is going to cost  
\(a serious and regrettably frequent mistake\). \(‘Oh! Let’s charge a tenner!’ ‘Why?’\)  
• Not involving everyone concerned in the budget preparation and failing to identify the full range of costs  
accurately.  
• Being over optimistic about demand for the event or failing to find a venue with enough capacity to do it  
properly.  
• Overlooking subsidiary issues such as the costs of ensuring safety and security, or the effect of having to  
add tax.  
• Not having enough capital or start-up funds to get the event off the ground, given the need for ­ deposits  
or advanced payments of various kinds.  
• People spending money but not getting receipts or invoices, so the money is unchecked and you have  
no control evidence that they actually spent it \(‘Oh, but I’ve got the bag of balloons!’\).  
The budget for an event may be no more complicated than a list of revenues and  
costs, or it may be vastly complicated. Either way, it has to be determined with the  
objectives of the event in mind. It is no good setting a budget in which a large profit  
is forecast, if the event is supposed to be for public entertainment and only intended  
to generate a small surplus or to break-even, because making a large profit might  
result in having to charge too high a ticket price. So, what is the financial objective?  
Is the event intended to make money or simply to cover its costs? If it is to cover

costs, what is the total amount that can be spent, specified either by the clients or by  
the organising committee?  
It is important to bear in mind that a large number of events, especially corporate  
events, have a predetermined budget as part of their brief, because the event is not  
intended to raise money, but to perform some other organisational function \(an  
example being a conference or team-building activity\), so that ‘income’ is simply a  
matter of the use to which the budgeted figure is put.  
For paid events, the ticket price issue is also a frequent source of heated debate,  
sometimes before any attempt has been made to identify costs. This is a very common  
mistake, partly because organisers wrongly see it as the most important issue. The  
ticket price might be an important issue, but it simply is not good enough to say ‘We  
must make it cheap or no-one will come.” This is usually based on someone’s private  
opinion, not on a carefully budgeted assessment of the costs, let alone on an objective  
view of what the target market would really pay. In essence, costs need to be listed  
first and accurately \(not just, ‘My mate said it would be the same as the one they did  
last year at the football ground’\). Quotes or actual prices need to be obtained for all  
aspects of the activity. For the football ground, for example, by getting the cost quote  
from the ground manager, not from ‘your mate’. In some cases, there would need to  
be more than one quote. Quotations should be made on a like for like basis, and the  
criteria decided \(do you want the cheapest quotation, or the best quality of goods or  
services, etc.?\). From there, the expenditure can be assessed and then, and only then,  
should a ticket price be estimated, bearing in mind the numbers expected to come.  
In the case of certain types of events there might also be differential pricing of  
tickets \(e.g. at sporting events, where the best seats have a higher price\). Differential  
pricing also allows us to provide a range of tickets at a range of prices, for example,  
family tickets, group tickets, full price or off-peak tickets. This requires careful under-  
standing. Suppose our event needs to sell 120 tickets at €10 each to make our target  
profit, but our estimates of what the target market will pay show that only half the  
people we expect to attend will pay the full price, even though we are expecting an  
attendance of 120 people. What do we do? Perhaps we might have to cancel. On the  
other hand, we might find that the rest are willing to pay €6 for tickets \(we will call

these ‘contribution price’ tickets\). Does this help, even if we have said the ticket price  
must be €10? It depends on whether €6 will be enough to cover our fixed costs, and  
if enough people paying full price still want to come. Fixed costs might be €5 per  
person \(this is a simplified example\).  
The total income would thus be €960 and the event would make a profit, even  
though we couldn’t sell all our tickets at the full price and make the full profit.  
You will have noticed that I didn’t use the word ‘discount’ in this example. Forget  
‘discount’, as it gives you the wrong idea, since the contribution tickets still have to  
cover all fixed costs, and we still have to sell enough of both tickets to cover our total  
costs. This is why you can go to, say, a leisure centre or a theme park at an off-peak  
period and pay less than you would at a peak period. It is about having differential  
ticket prices for different times, for different target markets and different groups, in  
the knowledge that not everyone will pay full price, at any given time. Airlines do  
it too. You might have got the last two seats on a plane at €50, when everyone else  
has paid €500 a ticket, but that is because the plane is covering its total costs, and  
they might as well have two people with cheap seats, rather than two empty seats.  
On the other hand, if everyone paid €50, then they probably couldn’t afford to taxi  
the plane along the runway. This is also true of events and can lead you to do some  
creative ticket pricing, if you have to. But only if you have to.  
A major issue for event organisers is to know how many people will attend. In  
order to prepare a reasonably accurate budget, the estimates of attendance may be  
based on surveys of the market, attendance at similar or previous events, knowledge  
of the size of the available customer base, and so on. From the point of view of budget  
preparation, an organiser might want to be optimistic about attendance, but, given  
the potential problems about booking deadlines and deposits, it is important to be  
realistic about how many tickets can be sold and whether the venue can be filled,  
or whether the budget should estimate to break-even, if, say, half the venue is filled.  
Optimism is very nice, but the real test is often when the organising committee or  
sales team go out and try to sell tickets and find that ‘no one wants to buy them yet’.  
There are ways in which this kind of response can be influenced, such as by asking  
for a deposit \(once people have committed some money they are generally likely to  
pay the balance when the time comes\), or by offering discounts for advance purchase  
\(rather like advance purchase airline tickets\), or by selling tickets to key opinion  
formers as a way of generating interest.  
Break-even is a key issue and sometimes not well understood. Say an event will  
cost €500 to put on, and the venue will accommodate 100 people. At first glance  
you might say, we need to sell 100 tickets at €5. But if you did this, you would make  
a loss, even if 99 out of the 100 tickets were sold. You have to consider what your  
realistic break-even point is. To make €100 profit in this case you would have to sell  
100 tickets at a ticket price of €6, not €5.  
Other difficulties arise due to unforeseen costs or subsidiary issues, a common one  
being whether tax has to be added to ticket prices. For most small-scale or family  
events, this is irrelevant, but for big events it would have to be checked with the cor-  
rect government department, as there is a minimum threshold for payment \(in the  
UK, this is the HM Revenue and Customs, and the UK VAT threshold at the time of  
writing is €68 000 before registration is required\).  
For those new to events budgeting, the Preliminary Budget Form in Figure 6.4  
will help you understand what is needed and what information may be missing. It  
may also show that once you have identified all the costs, your first ideas about how  
much to charge as an entry fee or ticket may be completely wrong. Most important

of all, it may also be evident that there is no margin of safety in running the event  
between its revenue and its forecast costs. In simple terms, there have to be enough  
people attending and paying to cover the costs and make sure there is a profit or  
small surplus. \(Although some events are not intended to make a profit.\)  
Suppose our total costs are €1,000. We forecast that 100 people will attend, so the  
cost would appear to be €10 per person. This, however, is not a safe position to be  
in, as even if 99 people come to the event it will still make a loss. The budget should  
be worked out based on the idea that more people will come to the event than are  
needed to cover the costs, for example, 125 people at €10. Or that the ticket price is  
higher, for example, 100 people at €12.50. In this respect it is also necessary to take  
into account not only how many people we expect to attend, but whether the venue  
capacity is appropriate. If the venue will only accommodate 75 people but we need  
100 people to attend in order to cover our costs or make a profit, then the event is  
not viable at that venue. It is possible, on the basis of various cost estimates, for the  
organising committee or finance officer to prepare some comparative outline bud-  
gets to help the decision-making process, where an issue, like the venue, needs to be  
compared with others \(see Figure 6.5\).  
This first attempt at providing an adequate outline budget will help us identify  
what further information is needed to prepare a more detailed budget forecast. The  
detailed budget can be based on a given number of attendees, or we can have alter-  
natives showing worst case and best case. It is necessary, probably crucial, to have a  
good idea of the point at which the event will break-even and make a profit. For this  
we have to bear in mind that some costs are fixed and some are variable \(Garrison  
et al. 2016\). For example, for whatever number of people attend, the cost of hiring  
a marquee for an event would be fixed, let us say €1,450. The marquee will still cost  
€1,450 whether one person attends our event or whether 100 people attend – this  
is a fixed cost. On the other hand, the cost of the food might be variable in relation

case of the meal, if one person attends the cost is €20. If 50 people attend the cost is  
€1,000 and if 100 people attend it is €2,000. This is a variable cost \(see Figure 6.6\).  
In terms of expenditure and costs it is essential that we have properly calculated the  
total costs and have included every cost that might be involved. It is very important  
to ensure that all the costs have been checked and that the list is genuinely complete.

Note that the margin of safety is the amount of capacity or production above the break-even point which you can  
achieve with the expected demand \(as opposed to the maximum capacity of a venue or maximum possible produc-  
tion\). In this example, the maximum attendance you expect is 100 people, even though the venue could accommodate  
120\. To achieve a profit 54 or more people must attend.  
# The detailed budget  
It would be very easy to use the common financial term ‘budgetary control’ at this  
stage. However, ‘control’ often concentrates financial managers’ minds only on costs  
or expenditure, and clearly, in event management terms, revenue generation and the  
whole picture are equally important. If the event objective is about quality rather than  
profitability, then over-concentration on costs might well damage the success of the  
event, because cheap materials would be bought rather than good quality ones. We  
have already noted that certain types of events can be more revenue-led than cost-led.  
A budget is a forecast or plan, which helps to regulate the operation of an event \(or  
any business\) over a given period of time. In the case of a business such as a hotel, the  
budget might be an annual one. In the case of an event, because events are one-off and  
time limited, the budget will normally be for the time period of that event. A budget is  
also a management tool by which responsibility for various activities \(e.g. sales or the  
control of costs\) can be seen, in much the same way as the general event plan. The bud-  
get, both a forecast of what is intended to happen and a record of what is happening  
\(or, after the event, of what had happened\), acts as a means of comparing the forecast  
with the reality and sets targets that the organisers can strive to achieve \(see Figure 6.7\).  
The advantages of having a budget are that it is a detailed forecast of what should  
be happening financially, and as such it helps planning \(Yeoman et al. 2012\) but, as

with any other element of a plan, it should not be a single controlling factor. A budget  
is just that, a financial guide, not a straitjacket. The budget should result in better  
coordination between the organisers of an event. For example, the budget could be  
split into revenue budget, as a target for the ticket sales staff to achieve; a publicity

# CASE STUDY  
# 20  
# Event break-even\: the annual dinner of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway  
# Anton Shone  
***Wirksworth, England A steam train on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway, which is run by volunteers***  
FACTBOX  
• The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway  
• 14 km heritage railway at Wirksworth, near Derby, England  
• Runs a number of public events each year  
• Annual dinner targeted at members and shareholders  
• Purpose of the event\: to raise money for the railway  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the concepts of break-even and profitability in relation to  
putting on an event with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which break-even is calculated for a known example.  
• To highlight how main sources of revenue \(e.g. tickets\) might be supplemented by other sources.  
• To understand that careful control of costs is important to ensure events are profitable or that  
they break-even \(not all events are commercial or intended to be profitable\).  
**T** he Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is typical of the  
many heritage railways and railway museums  
in the UK and in other parts of Europe. It is a 14 km  
privately-owned railway line in the English Midlands,  
providing a tourist experience for people interested  
in railway history, steam locomotives and historic rail-  
way equipment and artifacts. As a ­ tourist attraction  
run largely by volunteers, it not only raises its reve-  
nue through ticket sales, retail activities, catering and  
other commercial means, but also through events of

various kinds, charitable grants and donations and  
local authority contributions. This range of fundrais-  
ing is necessary to keep the railway operational and  
to help restore and maintain its historic artifacts.  
In the 2018 event season the following annual  
dinner was costed. This type of dinner, often called  
a fundraising dinner, is very typical of this sort of  
event. Such dinners are common amongst all kinds  
of charitable, voluntary and sporting organisations,  
and in the case of some of the smaller organisations,  
a dinner of this kind may be the major social event  
in their calendar. In most cases the objectives are  
as follows. Primary objective\: fundraising \(either in  
general, or for a specific reason, e.g. new equip-  
ment; refurbishment of premises; new fencing, etc.\);  
secondary objectives\: social meeting of an organisa-  
tion’s members and supporters; raising of the organ-  
isation’s profile amongst potential supporters and  
sponsors; opportunity to invite honoured guests,  
contributors or sponsors by way of thanks for their  
interest in, or help given to, the organisation.  
In the case of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway,  
the primary purpose is to raise funds for the main-  
tenance and repair of historic rolling stock \(engines,  
carriages, wagons, etc.\). The secondary purpose  
is to provide a social opportunity for the railway’s  
shareholders and members, the budget for the  
event being based on a maximum number of 150  
guests and a break-even point of 38 guests.  
There are some interesting issues in considering  
these data\:  
First, unlike our text examples, the fixed costs  
for this dinner can be reduced somewhat to lower  
the break-even point. For example, this could be  
done by not hiring a guest speaker and so elimi-  
nating the expenses allocated. Thus, if demand for  
tickets were very low indeed, but those attending  
still wished it to go ahead without having a speaker,  
some fixed costs could be saved here. Some further  
fixed costs could be saved by not having the menus  
and place cards printed professionally, but simply  
printing one menu per table on a home computer.  
Also, the cost of mailing out final tickets may fall if  
there are fewer of them \(not all organisations are  
large enough to provide internet or app ticketing\).  
So, if the organisation wanted the event to go ahead  
for secondary reasons \(in this case social reasons\)  
this could still be done, even though very little profit  
could be made.

Second, further money could be raised during the  
event itself, separate from ticket revenue. This is very  
common at charitable dinners and is done by hold-  
ing raffles, playing bingo, having a range of money-  
raising games \(e.g. tops and tails, etc.\) or holding  
auctions of donated gifts or pledges. Third, the very  
act of holding the event might bring in new spon-  
sors, advertisers or useful contacts. In consequence,  
if organisers at any fundraising dinner had to make a  
decision about whether to run their dinner in the case  
of only break-even on ticket sales, they might still  
wish to carry on because of the secondary benefits.

# Discussion Questions  
**1** Suppose the above event had three additional  
revenue-earning games\: a raffle, a bingo game  
and an auction of a prize, which respectively  
brought in €350 per activity, what would be  
the total profit of this event at its maximum  
capacity?  
**2** Consider any fundraising activity or dinner you  
have attended. How has the main revenue been  
# Further Reading  
earned and what additional sources of revenue  
have the organisers found?  
**3** The guest speaker’s expenses in this case were  
very small, the speaker being a local person  
with an interest in railway history. What might  
the costs have been for a ‘celebrity’ or profes-  
sional speaker?  
**4** Might these costs have wiped out the potential  
profit of this event? How could this be overcome?

and promotion budget for the marketing staff to keep within and an operations  
budget for the events manager to ensure that he/she has not overspent on printing,  
decorations, staff, equipment or other resources. The budget is intended to act as  
a measure of performance between that which is forecast and the actual outcome  
which the organisers are responsible for. This forecasting may often be difficult for  
events because of their unique nature, and it may be simply an approximate estimate.  
On the other hand, some events may have occurred before, in similar circumstances,  
or in previous years, and a new budget can be created with a little adjustment from  
the actual outcome of the last event.  
Budgeting is also a method of controlling expenses and costs because it should  
help to establish clear lines of responsibility about who can or cannot spend money.  
Related to this, the budget should also make managers aware of costs and revenues,  
so that they do not become over-enthusiastic in spending money, or fail to exploit  
an opportunity to make money or generate revenue from some aspect of the event.  
For example, it might be very nice to have a media celebrity open a carnival or pres-  
ent the winners of a sports competition with their prize, but most media celebrities  
charge a major fee for appearing, and if this has not been budgeted for, it should not  
be done – it might result in an event that should have been profitable making a loss.  
Because it is helping the planning process, the budget should also seek to ensure  
that the resources available to the organiser are most economically or efficiently used,  
thus helping to keep costs under control or to ensure a profit or surplus is made.  
For example, there is no point hiring 20 ushers all day if they are only going to be  
needed for the first ten minutes, and costs like this might well show up in the forecast  
as being out of line with the rest of the budget. The budget can be made more or  
less detailed depending on the needs of the organisers or clients. For a small event, it  
might be enough to include minor costs \(cost of ushers, for example\) in the budget  
line about staffing. On the other hand, we might want to have full and complete  
details of all items. To do this, the general budget, with its list of incomes and costs,  
can be broken down into extra information \(see Figure 6.8\).

# 139  
# Who spends what  
We have now prepared our detailed budget, it has been approved by the clients or  
the organising committee, and the serious preparations are about to begin. People  
will want to go out and spend money, but before they do, it is vital that we have a  
control system in place to record who is spending what, when and how. Each part of  
the budget needs to have someone responsible for it \(not just the finance officer who  
wrote it\). The revenue part of the budget might be the responsibility of the market-  
ing department, together with their own expenditure. For example, the advertising  
expenditure budget might be €1,000, but in giving the marketing department this  
amount to spend, we expect them to attract 500 people to the event, paying €10 a  
ticket. Therefore, the marketing department must have its own clear targets about  
how its money is best spent to attract the 500 people. Similarly, if we expect the  
catering department to make money, say, €500 on beverages, it needs to have some  
idea of what kind of beverages it is going to sell, and how many it will have to sell  
and at what price and profit to make the expected €500.  
An important issue is who is allowed to spend money. If a department has a bud-  
get, normally it will be the department head that has the authority to spend it, and  
the key question is how much and who else can authorise this. Events management  
depends on the ability of managers and events organisers to solve problems, often  
very quickly. If they do not have the funds to do this, or the ability to take decisions  
quickly, then the event may fail \(the ticketing fiasco at the Millennium Dome open-  
ing night is an example – the inability to deal with the problem of not being able  
to get enough tickets out to enough people might have resulted from the ticketing  
manager’s lack of authority to spend enough money to get the tickets out in time\).  
Also, in normal circumstances, many items for events are pre-ordered, and for this to  
take place properly not only are purchase specifications needed \(which describe what  
sort of item is being ordered in detail, so you get what you ordered on the day, e.g.  
500 blue stacking chairs, not 250 green armchairs\), but also purchase order numbers  
for any item above a given amount \(see Figure 6.9\). In this way expenditure can be  
properly recorded \(Lucey, 2009\).  
Similarly, for small items, petty cash may be needed and a system will have to be  
set up to issue it \(petty cash is a small amount of money for items that have to be  
paid for in cash, say at local shops, also minor items and those that are too small  
to be bought in bulk\). Normally, an amount of petty cash \(perhaps €500\) might be  
held by the **event coordinator** and issued on petty cash vouchers \(see Figure 6.10\), so  
that people can be sent out quickly for things that are needed. \(‘Oh, we’ve run out  
of teabags.’ ‘OK, here’s €20, go and get a box. And bring me the receipt.’\) At the end  
of the event, the various petty cash vouchers and receipts, together with the major  
receipts and invoices, will be collated to make up the final accounts.  
The budget is also a mechanism for showing what is going wrong. If the budget  
shows a forecast expenditure of €1,000 on seating, but the real cost is €2,000,  
you need to find out why, and to do so quickly. The reasons might be legitimate  
and necessary, and you might have to adjust the rest of the budget to take account  
of this, perhaps by increasing prices or cutting back on something else. On the  
other hand, the reason may not be legitimate, and you will have to take very rapid  
action. Someone may be defrauding you, or theft is taking place, or any number of  
other ­ problems, which the divergence between the budget forecast and the actual  
might show.

# Other sources of income  
So far, we have assumed that income is derived from people buying tickets. It is  
important to bear in mind that there might be other sources of income or revenue  
besides ticket sales. These sources may be other revenue-generating activities, or  
sponsorship-related activities.  
Special events are such diverse activities that it can be difficult to generalise about  
them, especially in financial terms. Additional income is often needed for events,  
even those where there is a defined ticket price. For example, we might wish to run a  
charity or philanthropic fundraising race night and charge tickets at €15. This might

raise a good amount, above and beyond what was needed to break-even. But more  
money might also be generated for charity by having other activities going on besides  
the races. There could be a raffle or an auction of pledges. There could be games such  
as ‘hit the whisky bottle’ \(with a large denomination coin, whoever gets the closest  
wins the bottle, and the rest of the coins are collected for the charity\). There could  
be a **cash bar**, in addition to, say, wine included in the ticket price. A little careful  
thought can identify many good, simple, money-raising activities, thus helping to  
increase the income of an event \(see Figure 6.11\). \(Control needs to be exercised  
over loose cash, though. Money should be recorded properly if going through tills.  
If being collected in some other way, e.g. for charity, it needs to be collected in sealed  
containers, which should only be opened with two people present. In this way it can  
be counted and recorded legitimately.\)  
This is not to say that the financial manager of an event should not be actively  
seeking external or additional ways of raising money to support an event. In fact,  
the generation of additional revenue is often a key failure of many events, especially

volunteer events, because it is wrongly seen as less important than financial control.  
It is easy to see who is responsible for cost control within budgets, but the raising  
of additional or extra revenues is often overlooked\: no one is made responsible for  
ideas about it or for carrying through such ideas and consequently opportunities to  
raise extra income streams are lost.  
Events vary considerably in how they are funded. It is important to recognise  
that many events have more than one source of income or revenue – in fact there  
might be as many sources of income as there are costs associated with the event  
\(see Figure 6.12\). Equally, we should not regard the term ‘income’ as necessarily  
meaning revenue. The ‘income’ for operating an event may simply be a budgeted  
amount that an organisation has to spend, funded by the organisation itself. Simi-  
larly, events put on by government or councils may depend on a budgeted amount,  
which is funded by tax nationally or locally. The purpose of tax is to provide  
public services, of which sporting, cultural, ceremonial or tourist events might be  
examples \(in the same way that rubbish collection, street lighting and hospitals are  
public services paid for out of taxes\). Certain types of events can require start-up  
funding. This can be sought from all kinds of bodies who might have an interest  
in the event, not just government, councils or agencies, although there are official  
bodies \(and some sponsors\) who often have limited funds for this type of activity  
\(but many calls on them\).

# Sponsorship and public funding  
One of the common misconceptions in the design of events is the view that an event  
will easily attract sponsorship. This will only happen if there is a good fit between the  
event and potential sponsors \(McDonnell and Moir, 2013\). In practice, the attractive-  
ness of any given event to potential sponsors is very limited. The time and effort that  
the organisers might waste trying to get \(elusive\) sponsorship could well be better  
used elsewhere, perhaps in developing secondary income streams for the event, such  
as catering or retailing, as mentioned earlier.  
The most important aspect of sponsorship is for event organisers to remember  
that potential sponsors have to get something out of the event, and are extremely  
unlikely to provide money for nothing \(‘Oh, but you can have an advert in our pro-  
gramme . . .’ ‘Really? Why should I need that?’\). Therefore, it is important to keep  
in mind what the event would do for a potential sponsor \(Lunt and Nicotra, 2018\).  
There are several aspects to this. First, the event and potential sponsors should be  
looking at the same target market. It is no good trying to get a hearing aid manufac-  
turer to sponsor an annual student ball. Second, the issue of media exposure\: what are  
the marketing and public relations plans for your event and will the sponsor benefit  
from them? Thirdly, will the sponsor get some direct benefit besides media coverage?  
For example, some places at a table in the gala dinner; free admission to the event for  
the sponsor and a colleague or partner; complimentary VIP seats in the hospitality  
box. Without some or other of these benefits to give to potential sponsors, events  
organisers will have significant problems attracting sponsorship \(Kitchen, 2017\).  
We have to consider how potential sponsors view events. Large organisations or  
companies may be looking for specific activities to support their public image or  
ethical objectives. Therefore, they may regard sponsorship as a form of investment  
rather than simply a one-off cost. In such cases, the plans and controls for their  
‘investment’ have to be carefully balanced by the organisations involved, including  
the event organisation. It is not just a case of, say, an event needing money and taking  
the first sponsorship offer that comes along; it has to fit what we, as event managers,  
are doing, as well as match our policies and outlook. This is especially the case where  
ethical issues are sensitive and where charitable fundraising may be taking place -  
there are organisations out there who may sponsor your event but their nature or  
some dubious activity associated with them may crash your carefully constructed  
image or cause unrecoverable public relations damage.  
Sponsors will be looking not only for hospitality opportunities, but also for events  
that raise their image \(for example, as an organisation that actively supports its local  
community\) or supports some other marketing objective. In short, to get sponsorship  
an event organiser must fit \(conveniently\) into the sponsor’s own plans, as well as  
matching the event’s objectives. We must also be clear that sponsorship is, effectively,  
a commercial promotional technique, and not a method of obtaining donations. As  
such there are various mechanisms for seeking sponsorship, rather than just posting  
a letter and hoping for the best. Sponsorship agencies are now relatively common  
and can be found by searching the web. These agencies, for a fee, will seek to match  
potential sponsors with causes requiring sponsorship \(for an example, see www.spon-  
sorshiponline.co.uk\). In addition, there are a number of trade- and business-related  
bodies with an interest in promoting relationships between commercial organisations  
and those seeking sponsorship, patronage or other support. In the UK, Arts and  
Business \(formerly the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts\) is one such  
example \(www.artsandbusiness.org.uk\). There are also bodies and trade associations

FACTBOX  
• Begun as a newspaper publicity stunt in 1903  
• 22 teams, of nine riders, compete for €2.3 million in prize money – €500,000 for the winner  
• Coloured jerseys \(each sponsored\) distinguish the leader on time, leader on points, ‘King

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the way in which sponsorship may play a major role in  
event funding and marketing with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which the Tour draws in sponsors and how the Tour benefits from  
sponsorship.  
• To examine the range of sponsors for a major event and to consider what sponsors get out of  
their contribution, as well as what benefits or potential pitfalls may exist.  
**T** he Tour de France began as a 2,400 km bicycle  
race in 1903, as a means of boosting sales  
of *L’Auto* newspaper. Controversy dogged the race  
from the start and the ‘gamesmanship’ of the 1904  
race \(such as fans sprinkling nails in the tracks of  
their competitors, or competitors using cars and  
trains to gain ground\) nearly forced *L’Auto* to call it  
off. By the 1920s, it was seen as the world’s toughest

bicycle race, in which manufacturers’ teams battled  
it out. At that time the course was over 5,500 km  
long and under severe rules, although, some felt,  
even then, that overt commercialism overshadowed  
the cycling.  
In 1930 the competition amended its rules so  
that manufacturer teams were replaced by national  
squads \(of eight riders, picked by the organisers and  
paid by the Tour itself\); everyone rode identical bikes  
and a publicity caravan was introduced, to make up  
the cash shortfall from the manufacturers and their  
teams. For the first time, radio covered the race. It  
was first televised in 1952, television being new then.  
During the 1960s national teams were once  
again replaced by sponsored teams. In 1978 rid-  
ers went on strike over split stages and transfers.  
Concerns over drugs became an issue when Pedro  
Delgado won in 1988, having tested positively for a  
substance banned at the Olympic Games, but not  
by the Tour’s organisers.  
In 1998 it was thought that one-third of France’s  
entire population lined the route, but the event was  
remembered not for the immense public support  
and interest, but for another publicised scandal  
about drugs. The banned substance EPO had been  
found in one team car, days before the race, and the  
testing of staff and competitors led to various teams  
being withdrawn and a string of arrests, including  
riders, team officials and doctors, prompting sit-  
downs and go-slows amongst the riders. The Fes-  
tina team suffered the worst publicity, but sponsors  
stayed loyal to the event. Despite the Festina team  
being at the centre of the media attack surrounding  
this race, the watchmaking firm has continued its  
sponsorship with confidence and remains a sponsor  
to the present day.  
Since the days of the manufacturer teams, the  
Tour de France has been attractive to sponsors and  
they have stayed consistently loyal. For example,  
the US Postal Service began with a small team and  
a fairly low-key presence, but after 1997 replaced  
Motorola as the leading US team, expanding into a  
multinational effort that included Nike within its family  
of sponsors and confirmed its continuing involve-  
ment, despite some domestic criticism in the United  
States of a public organisation spending ‘millions of  
dollars’ abroad.  
The Tour de France attracts many major national  
and international companies as sponsors\: Nestlé,  
Champion, Credit Lyonnais and Ford formed the  
Club du Tour de France for the centenary event  
in 2003, whilst Astra, Coca-Cola, Festina, Nike,  
POMU, Sodexho and France Telecom were Offi-  
cial Partners. The sponsorship family extended to  
embrace a further 13 official suppliers. Each year the  
sponsoring and partnership organisations change a  
little and by 2018 the main sponsors and partners  
had become Antargaz, Continental Tyres, Dimen-  
sion Data, FDJ Lottery, Le Coq Sportif, Oakley, Spe-  
cialized and Tissot Watches.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** How do cycling and the Tour de France com-  
pare, as sponsorship opportunities, with other  
sports and events?  
**2** How has the heritage of the race, including  
some of the negative aspects, affected the out-  
look for event, team and personal sponsorship?  
**3** What implications are there for ensuring that  
each of the several sponsoring companies gets  
an optimum return and do sponsors now con-  
sider sponsorship an ‘investment’?  
**4** Why do sponsoring companies or partner-  
ship organisations change and how might a  
long-running relationship be sustained, whilst  
maintaining the independence of the event?

activities and seek to promote an ethical and social approach to business, which may  
encompass sponsorship or patronage activities.  
In cases where an event is sufficiently attractive to sponsors that it obtains one or  
more of them, the job is not over. An event organiser, having succeeded in getting the  
desired sponsorship, must then be able to service the sponsor, that is, to fulfil the spon-  
sor’s expectations of the event and its outcomes for the sponsor’s business or brand. To  
do this a Sponsorship Agreement is needed \(sometimes called a Sponsorship Business  
Plan\). Quite simply, there are costs and benefits attached to servicing sponsors. Both  
the event organiser and the sponsor will wish to get the best from this arrangement,  
and to achieve this someone from the event organisation will need to be responsible  
for liaison with sponsors, ensuring that the sponsorship agreement is fulfilled and  
that the objectives are achieved and measured. Elements of this plan would include\:  
• a Heads of Agreement, stating the objectives of the sponsorship on the parts of both  
the event organisation and the sponsor, and the person in each organisation who is  
ultimately responsible for ensuring the success of the sponsorship activities  
• a Marketing Statement, laying out the target audiences and stakeholders, and  
listing the methods by which the sponsor’s name or brands will be placed in the  
public eye before the target audiences \(target market\)  
• a Budget, dealing with how the funds received from the sponsorship would be  
allocated, e.g. on prizes, equipment, kit, gear, buildings, etc., and also  
• dealing with what supporting funding would be available for promotion \(the  
sponsor would, no doubt, wish their name to appear on poster boards, ­ marketing  
material, programmes, brochures, signs and any number of other items associated  
with the event\).  
Where there is more than one sponsor, ­ respective areas of promotion are allo-  
cated in the sections of the agreement. An evaluation section will also be found here,  
dealing with how the impact of the sponsorship would be measured; for example,  
in the keeping of press ­ cuttings, minutes of exposure obtained in TV or radio news  
or other media and whether participants’ awareness of the sponsor had been raised.  
In addition to this plan, the event organiser’s liaison officer or team will need their  
own checklist to deal with those items needed to support the sponsor\:  
• liaison officer’s time  
• allocation of corporate hospitality funds for sponsor’s support  
• costs for publicity, printing, signage, VIP parking allocations, travel and other  
expenses, and  
• ticketing arrangements for sponsors.  
In fact, this type of checklist can also be used to work up an estimate of what costs  
are associated with servicing a sponsor, and thus how much money in terms of sponsor-  
ship is actually needed above and beyond operating costs for a sponsorship proposal  
to be worthwhile. Quite simply, if the costs of servicing a sponsor are going to be more  
than the sponsor is actually paying, then other sources of funding will be preferable.  
Sponsorship is not the only potential alternative income source for an event \(see  
Figure 6.13\). The range of sources depends a great deal on the type of event. Local  
authorities or other funding agencies might be willing to put money into an event \(for  
example, a sporting or tourism event\) if an appropriate and suitable case is made for  
it and if such a case complies with the objectives of the funding body. It might be that

The provision of funds or donations from a patron, commercial sponsorship  
there is some kind of social regeneration, or other benefit to holding an event that  
could be of interest to the funding body. The event might, for example, attract a large  
numbers of tourists, or have an arts impact for which arts trusts and foundations  
might consider grants. It should be noted, though, that funding from public bodies  
not only requires time and care in applying, but the response of many public fund-  
ing bodies is notoriously slow. Let us repeat the word, ‘slow’. Indeed, even after this  
slow process, your application for a grant may not succeed. Similarly, funding from  
philanthropic bodies has the disadvantage of being rather difficult to obtain as essen-  
tially you are seeking money from a patron or body that needs to have a personal  
or direct interest in your event. The short-lived nature of some events makes this a  
problem. There simply is not enough time to build up the relationships needed for  
philanthropic giving for many kinds of events. However, if we are dealing with repeat  
editions, this may change, and especially so with arts-related events, which have a  
long tradition of attracting patrons through relationship marketing. Philanthropy can  
also be found in the strangest places, as even some of the most commercial companies  
have a strong awareness of their social responsibilities, resulting in company policies  
with very definite philanthropic outcomes; indeed many companies maintain small  
grant or community funds for these purposes.  
Any proposal for sponsorship, philanthropic or other funding would have to say  
much more than ‘This will attract a lot of participants who will spend money on  
your product after they attend the event.’ Measurement and quantification of the  
benefits will have to be stated\:  
• Does the type of event being put on match the social or community objectives of  
the patron?  
• Will there be a positive outcome in terms of public image?  
• Will it result in, say, employment?  
These are the types of questions which will have to be dealt with, very often, in  
order to get funding. In return, patrons should gain some personal or organisational  
benefits. Events patrons often gain preferential seats; admittance to VIP areas of the  
event; invitations to launch parties or to meet celebrities; attendance at a patron’s  
lunch or VIP dinner, etc. In some cases, patrons may wish their name on some aspect  
of the event, but this is by no means always the case; some patrons may wish to  
remain private supporters of an event, and to avoid the publicity associated with them.

# Summary  
**E** ffective financial management of special events is increasingly  
complex. The financial implications of organising even a relatively  
simple activity or celebration or a small personal event can be significant.  
The extent to which external funding, such as via sponsors, may be  
available could be more limited than organisers foresee. This makes  
careful budgeting for regular income sources and proposed expenditure  
extremely important. The careful monitoring, recording and control of  
these incomes and expenditures is a significant concern of clients,  
organisers, coordinators and finance officers of all kinds. The recording  
of the financial aspects, ranging from the purchase of items to the final  
budgeted accounts, is potentially important to the success of events,  
even those not intended to be profit-making. Therefore, even those  
new to event organisation should regard good financial management as  
necessary and vital.

# 151  
# Introduction  
The preparation and development phase for events is not necessarily separate from  
the planning phase and the two often run hand in hand. However, the business of  
getting an event ready involves considerable time, effort and hard work. At the point  
of implementation of the event, the workload will increase as will the number of staff  
and amount of resources required. The pace of preparation and development will  
also increase once the venue has been identified and orders begin to be placed for  
equipment, facilities, resources and services. The logistics of ensuring that all these  
items arrive in time for the event, in their proper place, in good condition, and in the  
style or format they were ordered, represent a considerable effort on the part of the  
event coordinator.  
Support functions \(such as food and drink, music and entertainment, technical  
services and related event activities\) can be very complicated, depending on the size  
and importance of the event. If you consider the sheer complexity of the preparations  
for even a modest family wedding, it becomes evident how crucial careful logistical  
preparations are. Different types of events will require different support functions,  
which can be supplied directly by the organisers or contracted out. Where support  
functions are contracted out, the need for careful specifications of the service being  
purchased is particularly relevant.  
# Finding the venue  
In the very early stages of planning an event we may not yet have identified the  
venue, let alone what other facilities and services we will need. Together with the  
planning there will be early exploration of issues such as identifying the key require-  
ments, including those factors that will be critical to success. These might include  
the location of the event, the range of potential venues available, ease of access, and  
the ability to ensure that all the necessary items of equipment, resources, personnel  
and visitors, can get to \(and around\) the venue easily. The preparation phase of the  
process will therefore consist not only of venue-finding, but also of assessment of  
the logistics process. In logistics terms, our supplies are not simply products and ser-  
vices; they also include the flow of visitors or participants and visitor or participant  
services. For example, when we choose a venue we must ensure that our potential  
visitors are able to get to it easily, using their typical mode of transport. There must  
also be suitable and adequate access for visitors, for goods and event supplies, and  
in case of emergency. We can see from this that ‘logistics’ does not simply refer to  
on-site activities.  
Venue-finding is probably one of the first important aspects of the development  
phase of an event. In some cases, an event organiser might know exactly which  
venue to choose, in other cases the choice of venue may be extremely limited,  
especially in rural areas. In general however, a reasonable choice of venue will be  
available. The first question an organiser will normally ask themselves will be,  
‘What location is required?’ \(bearing in mind the objectives of the event\), and  
then, ‘What are the available venues within that location?’ \(noting any criteria  
about the selection, that was brought to attention in the screening process\). A  
number of questions have to be asked early on about the potential venue. What

we know about the type of audience for the event, and the event itself, will inform  
our judgement about the venue. For example, if our event were to be a national  
sales exhibition, then the venue would probably have to be large and central to the  
whole country. If it was to be a town carnival, then the venue might cover several  
locations in the town, as well as suitable areas for the assembly and dispersal of  
the carnival procession. Organisers themselves may have a good local knowledge,  
but if not, a visit to the area will be necessary to look around. Alternatively, a pro-  
fessional venue-finding agency can be used, which is quite common. Normally an  
agency or organiser will come up with a shortlist of three or four possible venues.  
These can be visited and a checklist made about the particular requirements of the  
event in terms of the venue. Whichever venue best matches the criteria should be  
chosen, bearing in mind price considerations and the professionalism of the venue  
management \(see Figure 7.1\).  
Site visits are useful, but the organiser needs to have a reasonable idea of the event  
requirements before visiting venues \(if you go with a poor idea of what you need,  
you give yourself problems later\). Visits should be arranged via venue managers or,  
for larger sites, the venue sales team. Where a professional venue-finding agency has  
been used the agency may also be able to provide an organiser, for a small fee, with  
professional help to inspect venues. It is important for organisers to make out a list of  
questions to ask each venue before going, in addition to a checklist of criteria. Much  
depends on the event\: for example, is a band required during the party? Is a stage  
needed? Will sound equipment be needed? Can the venue provide these?  
First impressions are important. The first impression an organiser gets may well  
be the same that visitors and guests get. Organisers should pay attention to all their  
senses\:  
• What does the site look like?  
• What are its surroundings?  
• Is it attractive?  
• What can be heard\: is it quiet, noisy, under a flight path, does it have good  
acoustics \(clap your hands to hear the echo, or listen for dead areas\)?  
• What does it smell like\: is it neutral, does it smell of stale food?  
• Does it have gardens?  
• Are the toilets clean and fresh?  
• Touch the furnishings and some of the equipment – do these feel clean?  
• Do your shoes stick to the floor or carpets?  
During your first visit you are probably not going to taste any sample menus. But  
if food is an element of your event, then once you have chosen the venue, you may  
wish to try samples of the food you have selected. This is especially the case if the  
event is large or involves VIP catering, so you can check if the kitchen or resident  
caterer is up to the job. On your visit, try to make sure you see all the areas your  
visitors will use, not only the main room, site, arena or hall, but also the entrances,  
corridors, car parks, toilets and food service areas.  
• Are these places well kept?  
• Is there evidence of activity, cleanliness, good maintenance?

All these are indicators of an active and capable management at the venue. The

# Logistics  
Logistics is the discipline of planning and organising the flow of goods, equipment  
and people to their point of use. Logistics are important to events because of the need  
to concentrate resources on a particular location for a particular time \(even if that  
event is multi-site and taking place over a fairly long period\) \(van Rijn, 2015\). With-  
out careful planning of this activity, the supplies needed to undertake the event may  
not arrive correctly. Logistics is also sometimes regarded as those issues related to  
the ‘supply chain’; that is the flow of materials, goods and services into and through  
an event \(and feedback from the event supply activity taking place to its suppliers\)  
\(Brandon-Jones et al. 2018\).  
Once given a venue, the event coordinator or logistics officer can address some  
of the major licensing and other official preparation activities, such as permits and  
insurance \(see Figure 7.2\). In logistics terms, resources and supplies that have long  
lead times must be considered early on. It is important to identify these issues and  
find suitable suppliers. Finding such suppliers and determining which supplier is  
preferable may be a significant and important task \(Thomas and Hansen, 2013\).  
Once a suitable supplier has been found, purchasing arrangements or a contract will  
be needed \(Goldblatt, 2014\). The contract will determine the obligations involved in  
supplying a particular material, item or service and will be between the event organ-  
isation as client, and its suppliers, which may range from caterers to entertainers  
\(Silvers, 2012\). For example, the event may have special power requirements, it might  
need additional utilities laid on \(e.g. telecoms, gas, water, sewerage, waste removal\),  
all of which have typically long lead times to arrange, especially if groundwork has to  
be undertaken to put them in. The logistics officer has to be conscious of those event  
activities that have the longest lead times and that must be dealt with first. A logistics  
plan showing the various needs and their prioritisation may have to be prepared.  
It is useful to recognise that the nearer the event deadline, the less able one is to  
make big changes without having to expend enormous amounts of money and effort.  
In short, there is a cut-off point at which the contractual arrangements have to stand  
\(this varies, depending on what supplies or services are being provided and how long  
they take\). Logistics officers will need to draw together a potentially wide range of  
support functions for an event to work properly \(Westerbeek et al., 2016\). One of the  
challenges events coordinators face is that if materials, supplies or resources do not  
arrive properly for an event, there is rarely enough time to reorder or replace them.  
Whereas, in many other business activities if the wrong supply is delivered, there is  
probably not a time constraint in relation to its use and therefore can be sent back  
and changed, without creating a major.  
The key to the implementation phase of the event \(i.e. running the event itself\) is  
good communications. It is helpful to commit ideas and important issues to paper.  
With a large number of people to manage, it is impossible for one individual to com-  
municate ‘in person’ with them all. Therefore, many forms of communication may  
be used to help ensure people know what to do\: briefings about plans, the event  
programme, the emergency procedures, etc., must take place. A useful tool in the  
range of techniques available to an event organiser is the preparation of an event

We have said that logistics is the discipline of planning and organising the flow of  
goods, equipment and people to their point of use. Therefore, logistics in events  
terms includes activities such as the supply of materials and services, equipment and  
provisions, arrival and departure of visitors, ticketing and enquiries \(in cooperation  
with the marketing department\), as well as the flow of people, artists and crew to  
and around the venue. Within this, the preparation, opening and running of an event

FACTBOX  
• DB Schenker Logistics  
• Group established in 1872  
–  
moving into global sports events in 1972  
• Provides large-scale logistics support for major events  
• It provided freight transport for 200 teams at the Beijing Olympics  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine issues of logistics for events with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which logistics have become of major importance in large-scale events.  
• To understand the way in which the issues of quality, cost and time interact in the organisation  
and delivery of goods.  
**D**B Schenker is one of the logistics groups that  
now has specialist Events Logistics subsidiar-  
ies; in DB Schenker’s case, there are teams for both  
trade fairs and sports events. Originating from Deut-  
sche Bahn railways \(Germany\), DB Group is a global  
inter-modal logistics provider and has been provid-  
ing events logistics services for international sporting  
events since the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.  
At this scale, events logistics range from over-  
all planning, scheduling and physical transportation,  
to the smooth integration of all the documentation,  
customs clearance and knowledge of management  
issues. All of this will be thrown into sharp relief for  
certain large-scale events, such as the Coupe de  
France, where teams are knocked out of competi-  
tive rounds or sections as the tournament or event

proceeds \(where a team may leave during the event  
and the logistics of removal will take place then, almost  
spontaneously, rather than at the end, as well as when  
the overall event concludes; when everything has to  
be repacked and transported away in a planned effort  
and timescale\).  
For the Euro 2008 European football champion-  
ships, co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland, DB  
Schenker provided logistics support for the hospi-  
tality programme of major sponsor Coca-Cola; for  
the press centre at Vienna; for the media subsidiary  
of UEFA \(the European football governing body\);  
and for the transport arrangements of numerous  
other media groups. DB Schenker felt that its expe-  
rience with the FIFA World Cup had enabled it to  
centre its logistics activities on three control points  
\(in Vienna, Salzburg and Klagenfurt, Austria\) and to  
schedule vehicles at specific times from these points  
for the movement of the supplies and equipment  
concerned. The group’s global experience enabled  
it to address the customs clearance required since  
Switzerland is outside the European Union.  
For the Beijing Olympic Games, DB Schenker’s  
team had been planning for the 17-day event for  
almost two years; organising transport, warehous-  
ing and storage capacity. As an official Olympic  
partner for freight and customs, it dealt with the  
freight requirements of some 200 national teams,  
involving some 1,500 TEU containers \(in shipping,  
container sizes are expressed in TEUs  
–  
Twenty-foot  
Equivalent Units; that is to say, the basic length of  
a container is 20 American feet\: 6.1 metres\) all of  
which had to begin returning almost as soon as  
the closing ceremony ended. Within Beijing, spe-  
cial ‘Olympic Express Lanes’ sought to avoid the  
delays that the Atlanta Games were remembered  
for; whilst DB Schenker trucks carrying official  
Olympic equipment could take advantage of these  
express lanes, they required special stickers and  
accurate bureaucracy  
–  
moreover, the city’s nor-  
mal freight deliveries had to contend with significant  
bottlenecks.  
The ongoing tensions between quality and cost  
and time \(QCT\) that are ever present in events man-  
agement were exemplified at the Beijing Games by  
DB Schenker having to transport some €550 million  
worth of media equipment for one US broadcaster,  
most of which was still being used in North America,  
just a few days before the Olympics started. Air-  
freight was the only option for this logistics require-  
ment, as sea transport would have taken too long.  
The implication of this is that in order to provide for  
the quality of the service within the time required  
by the broadcaster, the cost would necessarily  
increase, as air transport is more expensive but  
faster than sea or road transport.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** How vital is it that your logistics provider fully  
understands the complexities of your event?  
**2** How might one best balance the overall blend  
of Quality-Cost-Time. For example if you are  
short of time for a delivery does this auto-  
matically mean the cost will be higher and the  
chances of a quality failure also higher?  
**3** What are the implications of having only a lim-  
ited amount of money to spend on logistics in  
terms of time or the way it might be done?

\(whether it is a wedding reception or a coronation\) depends on getting all the ele-  
ments to the right place in time for a range of deadlines. This can be a complicated  
process and individual staff and departments will be expected to prepare their own  
order lists of requirements. Where events are being run by professional management  
companies, these organisations will keep on a computer database the general list-  
ings of supplies and suppliers used for previous events, which can be easily adapted  
according to the particular needs of the one currently being prepared. Supplies can

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. Technical facilities and resources  
be ordered and deliveries checked, usually at a central arrival point, and the supplies  
distributed as required to the parts of the site where they are needed.  
At a small event such as a village fête, most supplies could be accommodated  
in a store once they have been delivered by the local suppliers. These can then be  
laid out or sent to the kitchen, service areas, stands, stalls or whichever department  
requires them \(see Figure 7.3\). For a large event such as an International Air Show,  
the logistics task is huge.  
Many companies will be involved and the integration of the whole operation  
will be a significant task. A major air show may have 20 or 30 catering companies  
supplying visitor catering or hospitality pavilions which have to be set up, supplied  
regularly and wound down. Pre-planning may take nine months \(perhaps following  
a previous year’s event\); detailed planning and ordering, another three months; site  
**set-up time**, three weeks, including pavilion erections and the provision of utilities.  
This would be followed by the public opening, three days of inputting goods and  
services, one day’s breather, then three days of stripping out of goods and finally  
equipment. Lastly, a week of clearing up, followed by site restoration, all done to a  
carefully organised timetable.  
There will also need to be clarity in the logistics officer’s list of suppliers about who  
should be contacted at a supplier in case the wrong items turn up on delivery. The  
logistics officer should also have a list of alternative suppliers in the local area in case  
of serious problems, and they should bring the local phone directory or a print out  
of essential suppliers’ phone numbers to an event\: because they might not be able to  
get a mobile signal when trying to find something urgently and have to use landlines.

# TechnicAL FAcilities and resources  
The technical resources that events coordinators and venues are expected to provide  
are becoming increasingly sophisticated, to the extent that events coordinators may  
choose to outsource the hi-tech needs of clients to production or multimedia compa-  
nies. The larger and more important the event, the greater the likelihood of a need for  
specialists, although a contributory difficulty is that some venue managers may not  
be sufficiently knowledgeable about the capabilities of production companies and of  
the latest developments in contemporary technology \(Matthews, 2016\).  
Multimedia can include video, computer-generated text and graphics, transfer of  
pictures from digital sources and the insertion of sound or video into presentations.  
Similarly, rapid development in communications has seen some use of video confer-  
encing and, at large-scale events, satellite links from one continent to another, enabling  
the presentation of a speaker in, say, Frankfurt, to be made on a video wall in Bilbao.  
There is also the issue of the image a client may wish to foster amongst the audience.  
Consequently, there has been a significant adoption of theatrical scene-building tech-  
niques to provide backdrops for events. Larger-scale integrated staging and backdrops  
are mainly the province of theatrical or event production companies.  
The other common technical issue is that of sound and the need for sound reinforce-  
ment, at all but the smallest events. Sound reinforcement is provided by microphones,  
amplifiers and loudspeakers. Technical skill and careful preparation can achieve a  
very effective presentation. In terms of a soundtrack, there are issues of copyright for  
music and video, and in venue terms the quality of the facilities and the acoustics of  
the venue need to be taken into account. The development of technology to entertain  
an audience has moved extremely fast, from the point when, 30 years ago, the highest

If venues have suitable equipment available, venue management and technical staff  
should request that presenters come and test their material at least a week prior to the

text size for projections, are as much a problem as compatibility \(or lack of compat-  
ibility\) of the equipment and software itself. It is unreasonable to expect that hi-tech  
presentations will work first time unless the speaker and venue are regular partners.  
In addition, the level of technical skill required to solve the simplest of equipment  
problems is not always available on the spot. Increasing sophistication of communi-  
cations is also permitting advances in how, and where, events can be held. However,  
the resources required to operate this equipment may have to be brought in specially.

and other various  
items of event  
set-up.  
The staging of events has become increasingly complicated as technology has become  
more sophisticated and the expectations of the public have become more used to com-  
plex sets and productions, and this is particularly the case with music and theatrical  
events. Stage set design and construction has its origins in the theatre business but is now  
a highly professional activity needing experienced management and thorough planning.  
Considerations include how much money or funding can be put towards the staging,  
and what levels of expertise, equipment and supplies would be needed. The process, like  
many things in event management, begins with planning and the first results of the plan-  
ning process may be an equipment and technical specification. This might be followed  
by the modelling \(either in virtual reality or physically\) of the stage set being considered.  
From the model, discussions of the full-sized actual set may be discussed and issues such  
as the size, available space, backstage area, access, **load-in** and **load-out** timings should  
be considered, as well as issues of safety and who the responsible persons are in the  
decision-making process. This information would be worked up into a production spec-  
ification so that everyone knows what has to be done, by whom, when, where and how.  
Very often responsibilities for different parts of the set-up lie with different members  
of a technical crew, so, for example there would be someone in charge of Lighting and  
Effects, and someone else in charge of Sound and Stage, and this will be in addition to all  
the people involved in setting the staging up, rigging, carpentry, electrical work, and so  
on. With large scale productions it often surprises unfamiliar people how long the stage  
set-up and take-down process takes, sometimes two or three days for a major music  
event. Examples can be found on YouTube of time-lapse work showing these things in  
progress \(see www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjntOX1exts\) or search for stage set-up or  
**bump-in**. Naturally just watching the process doesn’t give you the detail about what  
exactly is going on, but you can research that using books or materials about stage sets.  
Whilst technical support may be thought to be essentially sound or visual rein-  
forcement, it is also the case that event organisers \(on behalf of a more sophisticated  
public\) are perhaps looking for a standard that is extremely high, and may be willing  
to pay for it. The backdrop, or staging, is of major concern. It not only provides the  
location of a screen, but is also the place where a corporate or marketing image is  
demonstrated. The backdrop may, of course, be simple\: a contained screen with banner  
and a little special lighting. On the other hand, the backdrop may be a matter of con-  
siderable technical expertise incorporating stage design elements. These elements may  
range from the preparation and construction of sets and stage flats to back projection

designs can be provided from a range of pre-  
pared formats, such as cityscapes, starfields,  
etc. or be purpose-made with a logo or theme  
to use as a backdrop. Other technical features  
which might be included could be pyrotech-  
nics \(fireworks\) and laser shows.  
It is also more common for large-scale  
events to use video walls composed of a bank  
of monitors. This has been a feature of special  
events at concerts and gigs for some time, to  
enable very large \(often outdoor\) audiences  
to see the performers. Where backdrops are  
constructed and set up by a production com-  
pany, the company may work regularly with  
a particular venue \(many large venues have  
links with local production companies\), but  
where this is not the case, the production  
company will have to undertake preparatory  
site work to assess factors such as available  
space, power, structural capacities and access  
to the hall, arena or site in order to do the job  
properly. The company will also work closely  
with the event coordinator or logistics officer  
to ensure everything gets to the right place  
when it is needed. For this, a production  
schedule will be drawn up \(see Figure 7.4\).

At music festivals, the staging issues are often  
complicated by the need to deal with several  
Equipment and set-up for a concert  
bands or performers during a day or evening.  
To make the transfer of bands faster, complicated parts of the band’s equipment, such  
as the drum kits, are put on Drum Risers. These are low-level flat trolleys which can  
be wheeled onto the stage and connected to the power and amps by a single com-  
bined wired cord known as the umbilical, so that band changes can be completed  
quickly.  
The logistics officer, working with the marketing officer and the overall event  
coordinator, must also organise pre-event meetings and use tools such as site maps,  
bulletins and newsletters to help get across major issues to staff, crew, artists, volun-  
teers and helpers, to achieve coordination of effort.  
Here are some further web-based resources which relate to event logistics issues\:  
• An interactive graphic based on the staging at Glastonbury Festival on the BBC  
website demonstrates the complexities involved in getting one band off stage  
and the next band on at\: news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/indepth/629/629/6231306.stm.  
• Mark Fisher, architect of the stages used on a concert tour by the U2 pop  
group, sought to find uses for them as permanent venues, once the world tour  
concluded. Three steel structures \(costing €20–€25 million\) and each in the  
shape of a giant claw were used on different parts of the tour. The production  
credits, construction photographs, etc., on the Stufish website at\: www.stufish.  
com, illustrate the planning issues and lead-times involved. The Stufish website  
also shows a whole range of staging designs for concerts and events.

# Lighting  
The lighting of venues has a number of purposes. In terms of function rooms them-  
selves the main purposes are to provide ambient lighting, to highlight artists or  
­ speakers, to light backdrops and to enhance the atmosphere. In other areas of venues  
the lighting has to provide adequate background illumination in both public and  
support areas, and some decorative illumination, particularly in VIP rooms, dining  
areas and foyers. The final lighting issue is one of provision for safety, and to help  
people feel secure, particularly in terms of exits and traffic routes in and around the  
venue or site.  
Diffused illumination is necessary in the public areas of a building. Corridors, toi-  
lets, foyers and reception areas should be well-lit, although not harshly so. This is nec-  
essary to enable the proper functioning of these areas, to ensure safety and security, and  
to maintain a pleasant general ambience. Consideration must also be given to lighting  
control systems, dimmers and sensor switches. Typically, the scalar illumination of  
public rooms should be of the order of 150–200 lux and a modern approach to this is  
to weight the recommended level of lighting according to several factors such as the age  
of users, the reflectivity of surfaces and the legibility of reading or of performing the  
specific tasks which take place in a room. In addition, emergency lighting is essential,  
and a legal requirement, in public buildings. This is usually provided by secondary  
battery-powered lights lasting up to three hours, activated by the fire alarm system or a  
power failure. Exits should be clearly illuminated and the emergency lighting sufficient  
to allow adequate **means of escape**. In some modern buildings, floor lighting strips are  
provided along exit routes, similar to those provided on aircraft floors to direct people  
to emergency exits. Security lighting is also necessary for areas containing expensive  
equipment, such as computers. Externally, particularly in car parks and around the  
building, good lighting is needed to ensure visitors feel secure. Lighting should be  
provided throughout the venue from the various public areas to the place of **final exit**.  
# Sound and communications  
Historically, the sound system at venues was, at best, a microphone and a couple  
of loudspeakers, and if you were lucky, an amplifier and a mixer. This tends to be  
inadequate for current needs. Consequently, provision of professional sound systems  
is often necessary. Not only is there the need for the audience to be able to hear the  
proceedings, there are also issues of sound reinforcement needed to go with visual  
tools and multimedia presentations, to accompany sets, to provide atmosphere, as  
well as provide the full range of aural stimulation for an audience at an event.  
Notwithstanding copyright law \(which imposes various requirements, including  
payments, for public entertainment and public performance\), music may be played  
from whatever system is available. Major venues are usually equipped to provide  
modern sound equipment, but, whilst almost every home has a player, and computers  
to enable streaming, not all small or municipal venues are so equipped. Organisers  
wishing to incorporate good quality sound often have to hire in the equipment to  
provide it. Companies providing equipment are able to provide equipment packages  
that will include not only public address \(PA\) systems, but also complete music sys-  
tems. Given the complexity of this technology, a package, including the hire of a tech-  
nician \(again an element that not all venues are able to provide\) is often necessary.  
A loudspeaker system may, in some cases, be built into a room such as an arena  
or large hall, but may also be in the form of quite large portable loudspeakers. These

would normally be set up between presenters and audience, and would also usually be  
quite high up, at least head height for a seated event, to reduce the amount of sound  
absorbed by the audience. Most loudspeakers will be stand- or floor-mounted, but in  
purpose-built venues they can often be ceiling-hung from gantries designed for them.  
There are some issues of aesthetics to be borne in mind, and increasingly loudspeakers  
are screened by some means such as lightweight curtaining, floral displays, or careful  
illumination around them, so that the loudspeakers themselves are in relative seclusion.  
Where an event is extremely large and takes place in an arena-type venue, there  
may also be a need to allow communication between more than one technician and  
between coordinators. For this purpose, it is preferable to provide a communication  
ring. Whilst this can be done using radios or cellphones, there is a danger of these  
interfering with other systems and of failure in an emergency. In consequence, a  
communications ring should be a secure landline. Sufficient time must be allowed  
for crews to set up systems in the case of a large event, and to obtain frequencies for  
events radio communications, if these are needed. The logistics officer should, when  
planning the provision of communications, prepare a contact listing, both for internal  
and external contacts. This acts as a kind of event ‘phone book’ and saves trying to  
track down information from bits of paper, business cards or badly designed website  
contact pages, and should be built up as the event is being created \(see Figure 7.5\).  
# Amenities and cleaning  
Cleaning and clearing are issues sometimes neglected in the servicing of venues,  
sites and events. It is essential that when there is a break in the programme, or at  
any other convenient point, the opportunity is taken for minor rubbish clearing, bin  
emptying, replenishment of consumables and other stock. This should be planned to  
happen at regular intervals and can be regarded as ‘preventative’ action. Cleaning  
equipment and materials must be available and accessible to the support staff. It may  
be a ­ simple case of needing to clear up a broken glass. On the other hand, a guest  
may have over indulged at dinner and in the bar and proceeded to vomit on the way  
to the toilets. Delay in responding to these crises, major and minor, is typically due  
to lack of correctly placed equipment, material and forethought.  
In terms of the provision of amenities, the general rule is to provide one toilet for  
every 75 people \(of each gender\), which can be increased for VIP events. Portable  
toilets, for example, can be hired in blocks, and different standards of facility can  
also be hired, such as shower blocks if required. It is essential to provide servicing  
for event toilets, and supervision to ensure that effective cleaning is done. Admittedly,  
there are difficulties in maintaining cleanliness of portable facilities that may not be  
used solely for ablutions. Nevertheless, a proper system for servicing and supervision  
is as much a necessity as any other support service. As with most other activities, this  
can be contracted out but direct staff give you better control.  
# cAtering and Event HospitALity  
It is not only the choice of a suitable venue that will certainly colour visitors’ view of  
their experience but also the quality of food and drink provided. Event coordinators  
should bear this in mind and ensure there is sufficient time and space built into events  
for this important aspect, if catering is to be provided properly.

The organisation of catering varies considerably according to the type of venue  
but as a generality there is a choice between in-house catering as practiced by the  
banqueting departments of hotel-type venues, and contracted out catering as prac-  
ticed by other types of venue, ranging from public halls to sports stadiums and  
outdoor spaces. There are advantages and disadvantages to the various methods  
and the method provided by venues to handle their catering may have as much to  
do with historical precedent in that venue as with matters of profitability, flexibility  
and convenience.  
Having found a caterer, the basic questions and the starting points to determine  
what the visitor will have are the same. These are questions about the number of peo-  
ple, the refreshment times, the budget and the visitors themselves. It could be argued  
that one of the chief failings of catering at events is insensitivity towards the type of  
people attending. There is a tendency towards standardised and rather predictable

Figure 7.6 menus which, whilst convenient for kitchens and sales coordinators, may be inappro-  
priate for certain types of visitors. Increasingly, the public attending events is better  
educated in food and drink than at any other time in the past. The range of services  
on offer may be built around continuous provision throughout the event, rather than  
the traditional presentation of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The continuous provision  
may take the form of ‘all day’ facilities\: catering outlets on site, catering tents or  
mobile facilities such as food vans or temporary kiosks \(see Figure 7.6\). However,  
according to demand, the opening and closing of these facilities may be staggered or  
scheduled to cope with the peaks. The layout for café or buffet-type service also needs  
to be given careful thought. Bear in mind that people are inherently used to lining  
up in queues. In an unfamiliar situation \(such as at a new event\), they will naturally  
revert to this method. To plan catering outlets at events to be ‘free flow’ may therefore  
be counter-productive; people may be confused and irritated, especially if there is a  
log-jam at the cash desk \(see Figure 7.7\).  
Further considerations in food and drinks services  
• Have licences for alcohol and food sales \(e.g. from stalls\) been applied for, and given?  
• Is there sufficient space for food, drink and equipment storage, preparation and service?  
# •  
 Are these areas easily accessible, do they have the necessary utilities and comply with hygiene  
regulations?  
• What are the set-up, opening, closing and departure times?  
• What cleaning and clearing arrangements are there?  
# •  
 Are there selection criteria for a mix of catering providers, and what arrangements are there for them  
to pay for their concession, pitch or stall area?

In cases where there will be a large number of people at an event, queues at  
catering outlets can be relieved by having smaller outlets that deal only in drinks  
and small food, to help take the weight of demand away from major food counters.  
The same kind of rules apply to cafeteria service as to buffet service – think carefully  
about how many people your counter can handle at once. Add more counters or  
small outlets to ease the crush.

Food trucks are a feature at many kinds of events  
Buffets are popular at indoor events, and there are commonly two types\: ­ finger  
buffet or fork buffet. With the former, guests normally stand, with the latter, guests  
normally sit, and the buffet food may be hot or cold or both. Timing is an import-  
ant issue. Many people will politely queue at a buffet, which naturally takes time  
and must be taken into account when laying out the buffet. More than one direc-  
tion or side of a buffet table should be available. It will take the average diner  
20 seconds to load his/her plate – multiply that by the number of people and you  
will understand why more than one buffet flow is needed for a large event. It should  
also be borne in mind that buffets are often understaffed, which leads to chaos,  
inability to restock and inability to clear tables. The normal buffet service ratio is  
one member of catering staff to 30 diners. This can be raised to 35 if serving inter-  
national delegates, as they are somewhat less likely to queue, and this must be noted  
when laying out the buffet. For international delegates, it should not, generally, be  
laid out in a linear fashion but similar dishes can be laid out in various sections of a  
buffet table.  
Where events may feature a particular element, such as a gala dinner, organisers  
should ensure they have provided a seating layout for the event that will best suit the  
client \(see Figure 7.8\). For a full-service meal, the typical service ratio is one catering  
staff member to between ten and 15 diners, plus one member of drinks staff \(for wine  
service\) to every 30 diners.  
Menu composition and the range of food provided is significant not only in terms  
of the menu, but also in terms of what is within a venue’s capabilities. For example,  
a range of individually priced dishes may be suggested to the organiser, who then  
chooses a selection to suit the likely visitor profile. This is based on the view that  
organisers know something of the style, likes and dislikes of the public. However, not  
all do, and organisers often pick dishes they like, only to find that visitors criticise  
their poor judgement. Menu composition is, therefore, not simply a technical issue  
but also a serious question that organisers should ask themselves.

pre-planning, ordering and preparation of food and drink. Nevertheless, it must be  
remembered that the initial enquiry and first meeting between the venue and the  
organiser will probably take place with the venue sales manager or sales coordinator,  
although a number of organisers will ask for the chef to be present, to find out what  
the venue’s caterers are able to produce.  
The alternative is to contract out the catering to a specialist organisation. These  
vary from large national operations with many contracts, to small individual cater-  
ers with only one contract or business. Catering of this kind is common in many ven-  
ues. Contractual arrangements vary. Some venues may have one approved caterer  
who provides all the food, drink and related services for that venue. Alternatively,

venues may have an ‘approved’ list of caterers whom they are happy to work  
with and who are familiar with the venue, its operation, management and typical  
requirements. Some venues, such as public halls, may allow any caterer including  
the event organisers themselves, to do the catering.  
Where there are no permanent on-site facilities or where the on-site facilities are  
not suited to or not big enough for an event, outside caterers can be brought in. This  
might be one single firm to cover all aspects or it may be a number of contractors,  
concessionaires or franchisees to deal with different aspects. It is extremely common  
at outdoor events to have food vans or mobile kiosks. These may also be present  
around indoor events \(such as at large-scale sports events, where the stadium cater-  
ing is effectively being supported by mobile caterers around the venue in kiosks and  
trucks\). What typically would happen is that the event provider may rent a pitch to  
a mobile kiosk or food truck and it is then up to the mobile caterer to provide the  
service. In many cases different types of trucks or food vans specialising in different  
foods or drinks will be present at large events, as this enables attendees to make their  
own choice about what to eat or drink, whether it be food from a burger van or a  
doughnut kiosk, a hot chicken stand or a speciality food stall. Provision in this way  
relieves the event organisers of the detail of providing food and drink, of dealing  
with food safety regulations \(local food and health inspectors will be inspecting the  
individual providers normally\) and of having to worry about the logistics of food  
and drink supply; although some emergency supplies, particularly of bottled water  
and perhaps chocolate or energy bars, should be stocked and provided, these can  
be given away at the end of an event if not used, and free water is also a means of  
keeping drunkenness in check. In some cases, the entire event may be based around  
food and drink or be a large part of it \(such as at Christmas Markets\) and so there  
may be lots of vendors, trucks, vans, stalls, stands and kiosks selling ‘Street Food’. It is  
important that caterers and event organisers understand what has to be done, where  
the pitches are, that there are proper contracts in place, what the rent of the pitch is,  
and so on. Guidelines for these kinds of activities can be found on the internet, such  
as at www.ncass.org.uk \(the Nationwide Caterers Association\).  
The advantage of contracting out is that the organisers do not need to concern  
themselves with the technicalities of food and drink provision. They simply make the  
best contractual arrangement possible and act as a link between the client \(or visitor\)  
and the caterers. The disadvantage is a certain loss of control\: a contract caterer  
interested in cutting costs may have no incentive to provide a quality service. A  
related disadvantage is less well known, but probably more serious – loss of flexibil-  
ity. An in-house catering function is often highly flexible and can provide peripheral  
activities that contractors do not \(e.g. an ‘on the spot’ VIP dinner for a key client\).  
The chief problem is that contracts are often badly written, ignoring a wide range  
of needs, some of which may only occur occasionally but are nevertheless vital, and  
which a contractor will charge extra for \(‘variations to contract’\).  
The number of visitors attending and expected to eat may not be the same. At  
some kinds of events visitors may bring in their own food, for example to a summer  
evening open-air concert. For the caterer it is also of importance to know approx-  
imate numbers up to two weeks before the event, and final numbers two days in  
advance for booked events e.g. conferences, weddings, formal dinners, etc. This is to  
enable accurate food, drink and equipment ordering. A deadline must be enforced  
for bookings where the event has elements such as sit-down gala dinners as opposed  
to continuous through-the-day catering. The time of refreshments should also be  
checked between the organisers and the caterers on the day.

Visitors and some sections of the public attending events may be traditional in their  
tastes, but they are no longer uneducated in food. Travel abroad, ethnic and specialist  
restaurants at home, wide-ranging food programmes and articles in the media have  
engendered a far greater range of public taste. Venues and even hotels are not always  
in the forefront of change when developing menus, nor perhaps would the public  
necessarily wish them to be; but it is essential that the food presented is of a suitable  
standard, takes into account allergies \(such as gluten\) and is appropriate to the type  
of people at the event \(see Figure 7.9\). Sometimes this is not the case, partly due to  
insufficient attention to the type of customer or visitor, or to a lack of competitor anal-  
ysis, and perhaps complacency on the part of venues, which fail to do what, in other  
industries, would be called ‘benchmarking’. Older banqueting managers and caterers  
may recall the days when it was de rigeur to eat in competitor establishments or at  
similar events. This is now extremely rare amongst modern managers and the quality of  
event food sometimes suffers for lack of knowledge of what competitors are providing,  
or lack of awareness about how competitors’ efforts might reasonably be exceeded.

• Whether the food / drink is brought in from outside and how it is brought in.  
• What utilities and mains services are available at the venue.  
There are other common weaknesses in event dining, some of which are training  
related. Event dining often relies on casual staff, even on volunteers, and this is a  
particular difficulty. Such staff may have limited food preparation knowledge, or  
poor hygiene training, or may have gleaned their meagre knowledge of food and  
drink service from other staff, or from ad hoc demonstrations by the head waiter/  
waitress or head cook. Some considered effort needs to go into training, even if for  
waiting staff, this only amounts to a half-hour briefing before service about the food,  
the drink, whom to serve first, what colour the vegetarians’ place cards are and  
how to look around for diners trying to attract staff attention. Nevertheless, where  
professional caterers are present, either in-house, or contracted, the standard of staff  
training is generally very good.  
Meals are often intended as the highlight of an event, perhaps in the form of gala  
dinners or theme dinners. Regrettably, they can be badly done, with poorly cooked

• At Garmisch-Partenkirchen  
• Large-scale temporary pavilion for 1,000  
• Containing cookery and service islands  
• Also tabled, lounge and bar areas  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider the complexity of large-scale VIP hospitality service at a  
major event, with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the nature of the facility required.  
• To highlight key issues in the hospitality provision.  
• To understand the time sequence of set-up.  
**T**he International Ski Federation \(FIS\) have held  
world championship Alpine Ski events every  
two years since 1948, although there had been sev-  
eral championships at rather irregular intervals since  
the event was first held at Murren in the Bernese  
Oberland in Switzerland in 1931. These events are  
extremely large and over the 14 days of the event,  
nearly 200,000 visitors will typically attend.  
Hospitality in and around the Garmisch Clas-  
sic circuit, the Kandahar, which is within the  
three-mountain area of the Hausberg, Kreuzeck  
und Alpspitze, was provided in a number of ways.  
The main permanent catering provision, open for  
regular skiers and visitors in the season, is in the  
SonnAlpin Glacier Restaurant, the Glaciergarden  
restaurant, the Gipfelalm rustic summit lodge and

the Panorama-Lounge 2962. The Gipfelalm is the  
highest restaurant in Germany.  
For the championships however, it was also  
necessary to provide a far greater capacity, and this  
was done by the use of temporary facilities including  
pavilions around the site and hospitality and cater-  
ing services in the grandstands. One of the key ele-  
ments of this temporary hospitality provision was  
the need for a VIP hospitality pavilion and this was  
undertaken by Arena One and its partners.  
The VIP pavilion was a large-scale marquee  
pavilion structure put up and fitted out prior to the  
event, about the size of a soccer pitch and taken  
down following the event.  
A time lapse clip on You Tube, www.youtube  
.com/watch?v=H5YBxBUE\_h0, shows the pavilion  
from the point where it had been put up through-  
out its fitting out to its close-down. The time lapse  
shows the logistics of the interior layout being put in,  
the furniture being assembled and the service areas  
being constructed, then the facility being prepared  
with its equipment and stocked with its provisions,  
cleaned, dressed and then in use.  
At any one service time up to 800 people could  
be served within the pavilion in the different areas  
for main meals and for general hospitality through  
the day, with almost 11,000 people using the pavil-  
ion during the event. The facility required almost  
100 staff of various kinds from chefs to waiters and  
baristas, as well as support staff, cleaners, amenity  
and hosting staff, maintenance staff and supervisory  
and management staff.  
In 2011 the VIP hospitality carried the theme of  
‘naturally Bavarian’ \(reflecting the German province  
in which Garmisch lies\) and the layout of the pavilion  
included screened-off lounge and bar areas, as well  
as dining seating areas by the windows, for groups,  
and central catering and service islands with individ-  
ual stool seating where the guests could watch the  
food being prepared. The central islands had differ-  
ent roles such as the starter buffet, main and dessert  
areas, as well as a culinary display area where the  
highlight of the pavilion, the Otto Koch Cooking Bar,  
was located. The theme was carried through using  
large-scale graphics, that is pictures of the area, and  
by dressing the service island and the pavilion with  
wood effect materials, planking and logs to give it a  
local feel, these being materials used in the area for  
buildings and structures.  
Major ski events are held frequently around  
Europe and in many other places around the world.  
Large-scale catering and hospitality is essential.  
For example, an overview of the 2016 Ski World  
Cup held in Adelboden can be found here\: www  
.youtube.com/watch?v=eMo5bDivNCI and a short  
catering set-up film here\: www.youtube.com/  
watch?v=IVLnPeGbcvw. There are many other video  
clips on YouTube, Vimeo or other video-sharing sites\:  
choose an international event near you and look for  
video clips which show you how they are set up.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** For any given large-scale sporting event, what  
are the different types or groups of custom-  
ers which might have to be served, and how  
might the service styles differ to provide for  
these groups.  
**2** What is the sequence of set-up and pre-opening  
preparation in a hospitality pavilion or marquee?  
**3** What is the sequence of hospitality activity once  
a facility is set up for operation?  
**4** Consider a large sporting event in your area  
–  
how is food and drink provided and to what  
range of customers or groups? Might corpo-  
rate supporters have different arrangements  
from the general public for example, and what  
would these be?  
**5** If you have a blank canvas \(in this case let us  
say an empty marquee\) what can you do to give  
the structure some atmosphere or local feel?

Figure 7.10 food, indifferent service and poorly presented staff. Style and content at many events  
are as important in this environment as in the fine restaurants of great hotels, and guests  
often expect the same standards of service at an outdoor event as they would receive  
in a fine restaurant \(Cousins et al., 2014\). The problems of delivering this service for  
outdoor event caterers may be extremely severe\: anything from having no mains ser-  
vices, electricity, drainage, etc., to having to bring in fresh water in sealed containers,  
fresh food in chiller lorries, or even having no proper access to muddy fields where  
outdoor events are being held, except by farm tractor or golf buggy \(see Figure 7.10\).

A further issue is the feeding of staff and crew, especially volunteers. This should  
be a charge supported as part of the budget and there are various ways of doing it.  
Crew catering may be in a special area and the crew and volunteers may be given  
catering vouchers or tags so they can get their food and drinks easily. How many  
staff and crew need to be fed? With what? At what time and by whom? When will  
the staff dining room be open, if there is one? Do staff and crew pay for reasonable  
refreshments in such a dining room or crew lounge? If not, where and how are the  
staff and crew to be fed? Is food and drink for volunteers or staff entirely free, or  
subsidised, as part of the event, or as a contribution for their help?  
On a final catering note, it is far better to plan activities \(such as food restocking\)  
as a matter of professional routine, than to allow something to go wrong and have to  
expend inordinate effort putting it right. This can be called the ‘salt pot’ syndrome – if  
a function is badly prepared and not checked, there will be things waiting to create  
maximum disruption\: the missing salt pot will be discovered by a guest about to  
consume their main course, and who will, rightly, demand one at the busiest point

of service, causing widespread disruption. Typically, there will be no salt pots in the  
function area, and the staff will have to go to the wash-up area to get one – a loca-  
tion where, mysteriously, there will be no salt pots. This will necessitate the slowest  
washer-up in the entire site having to search for, wash, dry and fill a fresh salt pot,  
taking the maximum care, because it is now a ‘special’ salt pot, and thus taking the  
maximum possible time. The guest’s food, now cold, will have to be returned to  
the kitchen, and the guest will have to wait for it to be heated up. In the meantime,  
the rhythm of service for the whole function will have been destroyed.  
This kind of unprofessional shambles can often be seen in catering operations  
where staff have not been trained to maintain the flow of key supplies as they go  
along, or where there are a large number of staff behind a counter, none of whom  
are actually serving anything to anyone, just fumbling around, to the considerable  
frustration and distress of potential customers, who are watching them do anything  
and everything except serve. Poor managers and lazy staff may regard good prepa-  
ration as a nuisance, but it is the bedrock on which all else is built.  
# 175  
# Drinks services  
Bars for events are essentially of two types\: paid and cash. Paid \(or account\) bars  
are those where the client or organiser has arranged for some element of payment  
for guests; let us say for the VIPs, to have free drinks because the client or organi-  
sation is paying. In some cases, organisers may specify that guests may cover their  
first drink by this method. However, such arrangements must be made clear. It is far  
better simply to serve a predetermined aperitif \(e.g. juice, a spritzer or a fizz\) than  
attempt to monitor who is ‘just’ having their first drink. The alternative method is to  
set a bar limit, which the organiser will pay for, and after which delegates or guests  
pay for their own. Again, this method has severe limitations and could result in an  
undignified scrum at the bar to get as many free ones as possible before guests have  
to pay. It is far easier, and much more normal, to have a cash bar. Guests pay for  
what they drink.  
Bars at events should normally have a ratio of one member of staff to every  
75 drinkers \(for example, at a pre-dinner reception\). However, these ratios can be  
subject to variation. For instance, experience of a particular event may conclude  
that guests on previous visits have been particularly heavy drinkers, thus requiring  
a strengthening of the staff. The importance of this latter point is that the manager  
responsible for the food and drink service at an event meal must be flexible. It is far  
too easy to assume that a pre-set standard will do for all functions. This is an easy  
approach, but leads to a lack of attention to the detail of staffing and to potentially  
serious mistakes such as under- or over-staffing.  
There is also the related issue of drinks served during a meal. The most common  
method is for organisers to include an allowance of one or two glasses of wine \(or  
half a bottle\) or juice with a meal for guests. Thereafter, diners may buy their own  
wine on payment to the sommelier \(wine waiter\); similarly, liqueurs are usually on  
a cash basis. One bottle of wine \(70cl\) will normally serve six persons; with a com-  
mon ratio of three to one in favour of white to red in northern Europe, depending  
on the type of guest. Spirit service is of the order of 28 \(25ml\) measures to a bottle.  
In addition, jugged iced plain water should always be put on the table before the meal  
arrives. There is a belief that diners will not drink alcohol if water is put on the tables.  
This is fallacious, and it always results in tables asking for water and service being  
disrupted to get it. Such disruptions reflect an amateur approach.

# Introduction  
As with many aspects of events management, the breadth and range of types of  
special event make it hard to generalise about how to market events, when those  
events are intended to fulfil very different objectives and may be targeted at very  
different markets. The key to how an event will be marketed is the target market  
itself – knowing what kind of people will attend, where they live and how can they be  
influenced to attend. Marketing is not simply pushing out a few posters and hoping  
for the best. We need to know as much as possible about the target market, and be  
able to split it into convenient segments in order to best understand what techniques  
would make them aware of the event and attract them to it, as well as considering  
issues of differential pricing for the different segments of the target market. People  
have limited discretionary or disposable income, and limited time. This being the  
case, events compete for the public’s attention, money and time, against all kinds of  
other activities and attractions, from eating out to engaging in sports and hobbies.  
Careful marketing planning and effective marketing are required for activities that  
will help to ensure the success of what we are doing. As with other activities, there  
will be finite money, time and staff available for marketing and these resources need  
to be planned carefully and used effectively. At the initial stage, marketing was one  
of the filters, or screens, through which various event ideas could be put, in order  
to identify ideas that were appropriate. This filtering process should have given the  
events organiser a firm basis to work on, and a starting place to consider some of  
the more detailed aspects of marketing, beginning with research. Research may be  
required about the target market, as well as a thorough assessment of the competitive  
environment the event is operating in. Once this information is known and objectives  
have been set, work can begin on the budget, on the marketing schedule and on the  
event planning \(Pike, 2016\).  
One of the key functions of the budget will be to obtain the most effective market-  
ing impact for possibly limited money. Not all marketing is expensive. Indeed, some  
types of activities, such as public relations \(PR\), may have quite modest costs and  
be as effective as large-scale expensive advertising campaigns. The budget, therefore,  
has to relate to what needs to be done, and can either be calculated as a percentage  
of the overall budget, or built up from ‘zero’, based on what needs to be done and  
how much that will cost. Some commentators suggest that events should have quite  
a substantial marketing budget compared to normal kinds of products, perhaps as  
much as 10 per cent of the total event expenditure, as opposed to 3–4 per cent for  
most other goods and services, because of the short duration and unique profile of  
events, compared to other, longer-lived, types of goods and services. Of all the mar-  
keting planning activities, the marketing schedule is the one most likely to surprise  
people new to the job. The lead times for preparing some marketing activities can  
be shockingly long. It is not possible, for example, to bang out a brochure in a day  
or two, as you must decide what you need to say in it and find suitable pictures or  
graphics to use. The brochure also has to be laid out to look attractive, proofed,  
checked, returned, amended and checked again. This all takes time, if the end result  
is going to be professional, and then more time for printing, delivery and distribution.  
This chapter also looks at events marketing in terms of the considerations needed  
for new or ‘one-off’ events, as these will need more detailed research and preparation  
work, due to the uncertainty of the target market and the questionability of the suc-  
cess of the event, if a new concept has not been tried before. This can be compared  
with the marketing of repeat editions of an event, where the event has run previously,

perhaps for many years, and where a great deal of experience has been accumulated  
about it. In these cases, the market, its participants or visitors, may be well known,  
although – especially where an event has been organised by volunteers – the infor-  
mation recorded might not be especially complete or particularly detailed. A case is  
therefore made for the kind of information that a marketing officer would find useful  
to record for the marketing of further editions.  
# The target market  
In our case, the term ‘target market’ refers, in the main, to the people who would be  
coming to a particular event. We should bear in mind, however, that for some events,  
a target market could be watching it on TV, or via the internet, or follow it as a rec-  
reational interest \(e.g. sports events\). In the most general way, we can see that the  
target market for a rugby tournament would be very different from one for a heritage  
pageant or a motor show, since different people like different things. The issue for the  
events organiser is how much is known about the potential target market for a given  
event, and whether this can be used to marketing advantage. In addition, it might be  
wrong to think that an event could only have one target market or segment, as this may  
not be the case \(Jackson, 2013\). Take the village fête. The main target market might be  
people who live in the village itself; a secondary market might be those who live in the  
surrounding area; and another secondary market might be tourists who happen to be  
visiting the village on the \(hopefully\) sunny summer day when the fête is being held.  
In asking various questions about the potential market, the answer will help us  
decide what needs be done next \(see Figure 8.1\). For example, if the answer to the  
question\: ‘Is your event targeted at the general public?’ is ‘Yes’, then the next step is  
to consider how this knowledge helps us. It provides some focus around which to  
work, indicates what techniques can be used and what marketing approach might be  
best for that particular target market, given the resources we have. Appreciating the  
limitations of the target market concept is also important. The larger an event, the  
more likely it is to attract a more diverse range of people, for which a more detailed  
market segmentation study might be needed \(Reic, 2017\). Also, there might be ‘stake-  
holders’ in the activity and opinion leaders who themselves could also be regarded as  
separate or discrete target markets, at least from the point of view of public relations.  
Figure 8.1 Key questions to ask about the target market  
WhaT is your potential markeT like?  
Have you more than one market interested in your event?  
Is this market the general public or one or more specific groups?  
Can you identify the different segments and how?  
Will identifying the segments help you target them?  
What sort of age or lifestyle of person might your event attract?  
Are the different segments likely to be responsive to different prices?  
Are the different segments likely to be responsive to different influences or media?

# 181  
Part of the process of identifying the target markets for an event involves knowing  
where your visitors will be coming from. This is easy if you are organising a student  
ball, as the catchment area is the campus – students and their friends. Similarly, if you  
are organising a wedding anniversary, catchment is not really an issue, because the  
target market is simply the friends and relations of the couple. However, for many  
events an understanding of the catchment area is useful for the marketing officer. The  
target market might have been determined, say, for a horticultural show, to consist  
of gardening enthusiasts and those in the general public who enjoy gardening in a  
more passive way or those looking for a day out. In the case of a village show, the  
catchment might be quite small – people from the village and mainly those within  
walking distance. But for a larger show or event, a typical travel time of one hour  
might be seen as reasonable to define how far visitors might travel to visit the event,  
to be involved or entertained. As a ground rule, the more important the event the  
larger its catchment area \(see Figure 8.2\).  
Figure 8.2 Catchment and origin  
Where is your CATChmenT area?  
Where does most of your target market live?  
From how far away will people come to your event?  
What is the most likely distance \(or time\) people would travel to your event?  
Can you say how many people in your various target markets are in each catchment?  
How will these various groups travel to your event?  
Travel distances in the catchment are often influenced by the time it takes to get  
to and from the event from various population centres. An hour’s travel time on a  
motorway may cover 100 km, but an hour’s travel on a country road might cover  
only 30 km \(see Figure 8.3\). These limits in terms of time, rather than simply dis-  
tance, are what will determine the outer limit of the catchment area for the event.  
It would then be possible to calculate the size of the catchment area in population  
terms from census information, which can often be found on websites or from other  
sources such as from local media ‘rate and data’ information \(local papers often keep

information on population structure and social groups in their area in order to help  
sell advertising space\), or from companies who provide market research assessments,  
or local council economic development departments. Combining this information  
about social group size and catchment area should give an idea of the potential size  
of, say, the working population, or that section of the population in a particular age  
group, although not all information will have been collected in a way that makes  
it useful for event marketing officers. Nor will all the people in the selected target  
market attend your event. Attendance will be influenced by a whole range of things,  
from effective \(or ineffective\) marketing, to personal preferences, the opinions of  
friends or something else going on at the same time.  
More detail could be added to the catchment as a better picture is built up; for  
example, if the special event were, say, an opera, a large-scale map could be drawn up  
showing areas of upmarket housing \(given a presumption that opera-goers would live  
in those districts, which is not necessarily correct, but serves to illustrate the point\).  
Clearly, different towns and different areas within a town have different population  
compositions, and a thorough knowledge of the target market and the areas in which  
its members live would help focus the marketing effort on those areas.  
# How to influence the target market  
There are several reasons why a knowledge of the target market is important to the  
events organiser; the most important is that this knowledge enables some thought  
to be given to how to promote the event to a particular group, as well as knowing  
what kind of activities they would enjoy, or what marketing material they might  
respond to, for example\:  
• What they read.  
• What they watch on TV.  
• What websites they like.  
• What type of lifestyle do they have?  
For aspects of their lifestyle that the marketing officer could use as a marketing  
mechanism—see Figure 8.4. This also helps us understand the likelihood of their  
coming to our event. In all probability, our marketing plan will have to contain a  
range of activities, both to raise awareness of the event and to convert possible vis-  
itors into definite visitors. This plan may contain a variety of different approaches  
and use a range of different marketing channels \(Jackson and Angliss, 2018\).

# Marketing catchment areas\: Lake Vyrnwy Half Marathon  
# Jules2013/iStock  
# Lake Vyrnwy, Wales  
# Lake Vyrnwy Bridge, part of the marathon route  
FACTBOX  
• Lake Vyrnwy Half Marathon, Powys, Wales  
• Attracted 1,387 runners in 2017  
• Runners from over 200 clubs take part  
• Entry is about €30–33  
• Takes place on a Sunday in September  
• Involves runners, friends, race-watchers and half marathon staff and stewards  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the target market area for the half marathon in terms of  
both participants and observers\:  
• To consider the geographical extent of the target market.  
• To highlight comparisons between the size of a target market in a rural area and in larger urban  
areas.  
• To understand why splitting the target market for an event might be useful in planning the  
­ marketing strategy of the event.  
**R** unning is a very popular sport, with large num-  
bers of road races, marathons, multi-terrain  
races and related activities such as triathlons tak-  
ing place throughout Europe. There are a very large  
number of clubs associated with the sport, which  
also has quite a lot of sponsorship activity attached  
to it. The Lake Vyrnwy Half Marathon is an extremely  
popular event attended by some of the best runners

in Wales, around a good course known for its fast,  
scenic route.  
The race takes place during the afternoon, start-  
ing at 1.00 pm, with the fastest runners able to get  
around the course in about an hour and ten minutes,  
and an average time of an hour and a half to two  
hours. The race has over 12 classes, depending on  
the age and sex of the runners, with a number of  
awards for the various classes and overall winners.  
The target markets for this type of activity are\:  
• Amateur and professional runners  
• Members of running clubs  
• Recreational \(occasional\) runners  
• Individuals interested in trying the sport, but not  
wishing to do a whole marathon  
• Race watchers and sightseers  
• Friends and family of the runners.  
The catchment area for this race is quite large. It  
is a well-known race, through popular scenery. It  
attracts runners from a catchment area covering  
the whole of Wales, the midlands and the north of  
England, from where the drive time is about two  
hours to Lake Vyrnwy, which is about 20 km west  
of Oswestry and Welshpool. Consequently, the race  
is marketed locally and regionally in newspapers and  
by poster promotions, as well as in national running  
magazines, via websites and social media and by  
posters to running clubs and other relevant locations  
\(such as leisure centres\) in the area.  
The catchment area for those watching the  
race is rather less than the catchment for runners.  
Apart from friends and family of the participants,  
running is not a huge spectator sport on the scale  
of soccer, but nevertheless, people interested in  
running as a recreational activity do go to watch  
the race. Because of its scenic location, there is  
perhaps a one-hour travel time for spectators.  
There is no separate marketing programme for  
spectators.  
The issue of catchment and travel time must  
also be seen in the light of accessibility. If we were  
to say that catchment was an hour on motorways,  
this would cover a far larger area, because you can  
drive further and faster on a motorway than on minor  
roads. This means that catchment areas are unlikely  
to be circular, but will vary according to the quality  
of roads and access to the event location. \(This can  
be seen from the shape of the example catchment  
pattern shown in Figure 8.3.\)  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Take a map of Wales and the surrounding  
area. Consider the road network around Lake  
Vyrnwy. How does this affect the potential  
catchment for runners?  
**2** If this race was held in central Birmingham or  
central Frankfurt, how would the catchment  
compare, and why?  
**3** Consider an event you have recently attended,  
what different types of people were there and  
how could they be classed into various tar-  
get markets? How would this information be  
useful?

A word of caution for the marketing officer who might feel that once you know  
who your target market is, and what their media habits and buying habits are, all you  
have to do is to get the promotion or advertising right for them\: there are a range of  
influences on why a target audience might or might not attend an event. Sometimes  
such reasons are straightforward, like the weather. On the other hand, for an event to  
be popular it might be necessary to have a critical mass of people showing an interest

in attending. This critical mass might only develop through word-of-mouth via a  
reference group \(that is to say, the people we know\). For example, suppose the event  
is a student summer ball. Ticket sales might not have reached the break-even point  
needed by the break-even deadline, in spite of advertising in the student magazine,  
posters around the campus or other sales efforts. The reason for this could be that  
the reference group \(other students\) might not have shown a wish to go, perhaps  
because of other events planned on the same night, or of a lack of immediate interest,  
or other reasons, perhaps including lack of disposable income at the time.  
In general, the determinants of why or whether a visitor would come to an event  
are very varied \(and not just about whether we can advertise or promote our event  
in front of their noses\), and some understanding of this process \(the buying process\)  
can help us in deciding how best to promote our particular event. In general, these  
motives can be seen as relevant to the marketing of other activities and products,  
not just events \(Funk et al., 2016\). It is also useful to remember the points made in  
Chapter 2, about some of these motives being more important than others – primary  
and secondary motives – because we need to know how best to promote the event  
given what we know about why people will come to it. For example, a primary  
motive may be social, because the person knows that many of their friends will go.  
A secondary motive might be to be entertained. This process is also influenced by  
other determinants, such as whether the event will be repeated, whether it is easy to  
get to, whether it is adequately sign-posted, etc.  
It can be seen that there are some differences in the ‘buying process’ between, say,  
the purchase of the weekly shopping or of new clothes, and the purchase of a ticket for  
a special event. In the case of certain types of event, no purchase may be taking place.  
If you have been invited to a dinner party, you are not ‘purchasing’ the event – you  
don’t buy a ticket, you go because you enjoy the company of your friends. This is true  
of many types of event\: no buying decision is involved, only a social decision \(although  
there is the hidden cost of time and effort, which might be interpreted as buying fac-  
tors\). On the other hand, many special events, particularly in the sporting, cultural and  
organisational categories, will involve a buying decision\: whether to buy the ticket;  
whether it will be value for money; whether the event will be enjoyable or productive;  
and these issues might all be part of the decision in such a case \(see Figure 8.5\).

A number of determinants can be seen as being specific to an ‘events buyer’. This  
is rather a tricky term to use, as the ‘buyer’ may be a whole family having a day out;  
a group of people in a minibus going to a sports competition; or one person buying  
a ticket for a beer festival. If you were the marketing officer for an event, it would be  
important to have an understanding of who was doing the buying, of who gets the  
ticket and how you might influence them to do it. What places would you advertise  
in? What are the benefits of the event you are promoting, to the attendees, visitors,  
guests or participants? What price would be charged for tickets? Where could people  
actually buy the tickets, via a website or sales points?  
For the marketing officer, perhaps a significant issue is the benefit that a visitor or  
attendee gets from the event. This may also be related to the question of expectations.  
If the visitor expects an excellent, well-organised, enjoyable and good value event,  
then the level of satisfaction he/she would have would be very high if these things  
result. On the other hand, if the visitor is led to expect these things, but gets none of  
them, then the outcome will be not only dissatisfaction, but possibly bad publicity  
for the organisers. Marketing, then, is not just about getting people in through the  
door. It is, at least in part, about ensuring they get the kind of satisfaction they have  
been led to expect from the event \(see Figure 8.6\).  
Figure 8.6 Individual’s expectations of an event  
• What are the benefits of attending the event – will it be enjoyable, entertaining, diverting, educational,  
stimulating or exciting?  
• What will be the style and standard of the venue; distance from home; closeness to transport;  
convenience of getting there, ease of parking, arrival and departure and other facilities?  
• What will be the likely standard of the event – will it be professionally done – even by amateurs or  
volunteers, will it be well organised, will it be value for money, or will it just be a jolly, convivial, if moderately  
disorganised shambles? \(This latter may be a normal expectation held by a potential visitor . . .\)  
• What will the people be like – can we expect excellence, commitment, enthusiasm, knowledge \(or  
otherwise\) from staff, volunteers or other participants?  
• What is the price \(or value\) in comparison to other uses for the money – other possible events, other  
days out, meals or other leisure or social activities?  
# •  
What range of activities is available, interaction, sights and sounds, inclusiveness?  
# •  
What is the reputation of the event if it has been held before?

into an event by

false pretences.  
Leading on from the issue of what motivates and influences people to attend or  
participate in an event, we have to recognise the difficulty of marketing what are  
essentially unique, one-off occasions to a diverse market – and very possibly, a diverse  
market of people who do not know they want to attend or participate. In terms of  
personal events, there are no conventional marketing issues in getting people to a  
private party. These events are ‘invited’, not marketed; in fact, in some cases, the  
problem is to stop people coming to events where they might not be wanted. Gate-  
crashers are an example of this. We can organise a party for friends, only to find that  
they turn up with people we might not expect, perhaps even do not like, or that word  
has got around to people whom we would not want at our party. This happens not  
only at some types of personal event, but also at high profile public events, which  
involve celebrities or film stars. Various people might try to **blag** their way into an  
event by all kinds of unscrupulous means, such as emailing the organisers to say they

have not received the tickets they were promised \(when no one said they could have  
tickets\); trying to get in by hanging around, in the hope someone will recognise them  
and take them in; trying to buy tickets from **ticket touts**, and so on.  
For most events in the leisure, cultural or organisational categories, the issue is  
not how to stop people getting in, but how to encourage people to come. For a local  
charity fundraising event, the issue will be both how to get a good crowd in and to  
make some money for the charity concerned. For organisations selling products, there  
may well be a clear need to market the event, so that a lot of people come to see the  
product and hopefully some of them will buy it. This is especially the case with events  
such as trade shows and exhibitions, but the need to market an event applies to a large  
range of activities. An example of the decision-making process is shown in Figure 8.7.

There are some key marketing issues in this scenario. In promoting an event, it is  
necessary to create an awareness of it amongst the target market. In this example the  
method is posters, and the market is students. The interest phase is about stimulating  
the interest of the target market. In any target market, people who are considering  
attending the event will be seeking a reference mechanism for confirming that the  
event is what they want.  
For many people, the reference mechanism is from people they know, either directly  
in person or from social media exchanges, whether on Facebook, Skype, Instagram  
or whatever the current ‘exciting’ social media is \(Preston, 2012\). One of the biggest  
difficulties facing the marketers of events is that for new or unusual one-off occasional  
events, the word-of-mouth support may not exist, as no-one has been to the event  
before, or been able get a view of how good or bad it is. They then have to rely on  
external referents, such as the quality of the advertising material, or the views of critics  
\(as with a new play or film\), or social media discussion \(Lee et al., 2017\). In some  
respects, events marketers can try to generate word-of-mouth or social media support  
by targeting specific groups through having a Social Media Strategy and by offering  
‘opinion leaders’ activities such as pre-meetings, taster events or familiarisation visits

these warm-up events and they are only suitable for certain types of events. What we  
are seeking to create is desire for the product, through encouraging people to feel that  
the event will fulfil their particular needs and by generating a positive ‘buzz’ about it.  
From here onwards it should be easy. The prospective attendee simply takes ‘action’  
and buys the ticket, and the event, of course, goes wonderfully well!  
# The marketing plan  
The marketing plan, like the operational plan and the financial budget, will be devel-  
oped from the event objective, in a number of stages \(see Figure 8.8\). Marketing  
techniques employed by destination managers and events organisers vary, and the  
range of approaches is extremely wide, because of differences in the types of events  
being put on and the different characteristics of target markets \(Heeley, 2015\). Nev-  
ertheless, the nature of the event-buying decision and the influencing factors make  
targeting potential visitors relatively complicated for certain types of event \(although  
not all – a village fête would have a relatively simple target market in the catchment  
area of the village and its immediate surroundings\).  
The event marketing officer’s expertise and resources in selling the event may not  
always be large, perhaps depending on volunteer effort and small budgets, perhaps  
tending to rely on general awareness and word-of-mouth, or responses to enquiries,

rather than expensive advertising. For this reason, public relations \(PR\) may play a  
greater role in promoting some events than paid advertising. However, this should  
not prevent careful thought and planning about marketing as a whole activity, nor  
should it prevent due consideration of the need for public relations to address both  
external and internal audiences.  
# mArketing for a new event  
# Objectives and analysis of the environment  
If the marketing of an event has to be started from a blank sheet of paper, then the  
marketing plan will have to be written to cover six main elements \(see Figure 8.9\).  
Some of these should have been identified early on in the event planning process, and

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. **190 Chapter 8** Marketing and public relations for events  
should be easy to summarise in the first few sections of the marketing plan. These  
are the sections dealing with the purpose of the event, which might be written as  
one line or sentence, and can then be broken down into several smaller objectives.  
To make this as simple as possible there should be no more than about five aims for  
the event \(there might be only one, remember\), because the more aims you have, the  
more difficult it will be to achieve them all adequately. In addition, either too much  
complication, or too much vagueness, about objectives can render marketing, pro-  
motion and public relations efforts meaningless. This is followed by the analysis of  
the environment in which the event will operate, what competition there might be,  
what other things are going on at the same time that might take some of the potential  
target market away, and whether there have been, or are, similar events that could be  
seen not so much as competitors, but as complementary to your event.  
Figure 8.10 **Event components mix and target markets**  
The summary of the component products and services of the event is a list of its  
respective parts \(which might also be called the product/service mix\), that might  
attract different parts of the target market. In the case of a garden show, this mix  
might comprise the main garden exhibition itself; seminars on gardening given by  
experts to visitors; the prize-giving ceremony for the best flowers; the catering tent;  
the sales and retail stands; the prize draw competition to win a garden makeover  
from an expert; and the children’s crèche.  
When preparing the summary of the event’s components, the ability to cross–reference  
the products and services being offered against the likely target markets  
will help to identify which parts of the event might turn out to be the busiest, and  
will also indicate how the marketing and promotion effort might be targeted at  
individual markets \(rather than the general whole\), by showing which elements of  
the event’s components mix could be highlighted in specific literature or other pro-  
motional material for a given market segment or target \(see Figure 8.10\). At this  
point in the marketing plan, the target markets can be isolated and described in some  
detail, together with information about the catchment; the kind of marketing tools  
that will be used to influence each target market segment to come to the event; what  
media habits each target market has\: and what other promotions or public relations  
activities might also have an impact on the decision to attend. From this list, the  
most effective marketing tools can be identified, which, as the marketing budget is  
assembled, can be given priority as being potentially the most effective.

# The marketing budget  
One of the largest single costs in terms of marketing budgets for professionally-run  
events is the staffing cost of the marketing department itself, as almost all larger  
professional events have marketing or sales teams, or coordinators. The advantage  
that volunteer-run events have is that there is no staffing cost, but equally, for a  
­ volunteer-run event, the marketing budget might be very small.  
In normal circumstances, the student of the events business would probably auto-  
matically think of advertising as the major marketing tool available to ­ organisers – all  
you do is advertise in the right place and visitors or participants come flocking in;  
were it so easy! Advertising has its place and plays a significant role in raising aware-  
ness and helping to support an image for an activity. It is particularly relevant on a  
national scale for events organised in the corporate sector or by voluntary associa-  
tions in the national market. However, the wide range of potential events can take  
a wide range of approaches, which may include not only advertising and public  
relations, but also the use of a variety of other marketing tools.  
Individual events can also attempt to entice the public, visitors, attendees, par-  
ticipants and even potential staff by providing pre-event activities, or a series of  
­ awareness-raising promotions to help familiarise people with the main event. It is also  
important to keep the target market ‘warm’, i.e. to call and talk to opinion leaders,  
or invite them to familiarisation or hospitality events. In this way, some of the target  
market or ‘buyers’ for an event can be influenced or at least informed of the planned  
activities. You may also get useful preliminary feedback for the event.  
It is difficult to ascertain the effectiveness of the various methods, but personal  
contacts are often significantly important to marketing an event and do not show  
as a cost in a marketing budget, except perhaps as travel or hospitality expenses. In  
addition to the paid advertising, which an event manager or organising committee  
might or might not be able to afford, many events rely significantly on good public  
and media relations, anything from word-of-mouth to imaginatively written press  
releases \(see Figure 8.11\).

The marketing budget should be carefully prepared and costed. All the items that  
are needed should be included, the number required, and their size or type. In addi-  
tion, for items such as brochures or leaflets, the cost per thousand \(if this kind of  
number is needed\) should be compared to see which type is the most cost-­ effective.  
Wherever possible in the costing process, more than one estimate or cost quote  
should be obtained \(see Figure 8.12\).  
# The marketing schedule  
In order for a special event to be marketed properly, not only must the planning  
and budgeting of the marketing programme have taken place, but a schedule of  
activities should have been prepared. This schedule is intended to give the organ-  
isers an idea of the lead times for various marketing activities in order to plan what  
needs to be done and when, to get the most benefit from the marketing effort \(see  
Figure 8.13\).  
In preparing a marketing schedule, it is important to understand that many activ-  
ities have long lead times. Brochures, for example, may take several weeks\: the text  
has to be written, photographs provided, a draft assembled by the graphic designer  
or printer, checked for errors, corrected and then checked again before being printed.  
Similarly, for those particular media that a marketing manager may wish to use, it will  
be important to check the lead times. National monthly trade magazines might need  
two to four months’ notification of an event to get an advertisement in, with editorial.  
TV and radio shows require up to six weeks’ notice. Even a website might need several  
weeks’ intensive design work, and will itself require follow-up advertising. Local media  
can work on shorter lead times, but it is best to find out whether their deadlines for  
stories are a certain day and time of the week. A media kit or press pack can be pre-  
pared at an early stage of the activities, and could include various fact sheets about the  
event, artist’s impressions \(or suitable photographs\), a media contact list, information  
about sponsors, beneficiaries and key people involved \(Goldblatt, 2014\). However, the  
first version of the press kit should not include admission prices, as the media might  
focus too strongly on these at too early a stage in the development process.  
# mArketing for repeat events and new editions  
Up to now, we have tended to stress that many events are one-off, unique activities.  
In some ways this is true, but all kinds of events are repeated, perhaps annually or  
biannually, or on some other timescale \(e.g. the Olympics every four years\). Even  
events that happen annually, in the same place and at the same time of year, may not  
be exact replicas of what has gone on before, perhaps because of a different organis-  
ing committee, different participants, different visitors, or any number of changes in  
the operations and activities taking place. For this reason, they are often called ‘new  
editions’. Consequently, these types of events are based on existing knowledge and  
techniques, but, as with a book, some changes are made each time, perhaps some  
things removed, or some new things added.  
Admittedly, new business often presents a more exciting challenge to event marketers  
and salespeople than the routine of carefully recording, monitoring and caring for an  
existing target market. Yet it is this attention to the detail of maintaining and enhancing

an existing business base that is probably the acid test of a good marketing officer. The  
development of the existing visitor base into repeat business and also as a lead to further  
new visitors may be very useful indeed. Careful recording of attendance information  
about visitors and participants is the first stage in making sure they can be encouraged  
to return to the next event. It is also important to collect the same information each  
year, for the sake of consistency and to be able to make accurate comparisons. The  
basic information that we should be attempting to collect is detailed in the following  
subsections.  
# 195  
# Records of visitor numbers  
In assessing total visitor or participant numbers, how many and where from, the  
‘where from’ can be done by sampling surveys or by getting people to fill in some  
details as part of the booking process – it depends on how big your event is, and  
what resources you can put into recording. With limited resources, such as volun-  
teer staffing, you have no need to collect details from every single visitor. You will  
know how many tickets you sold, and of what types. If the event is free, volunteers  
can still be put on the entrances or gates to give a rough count of people coming in,  
and if it is in an open area estimates can still be made \(see also the Deventer Book  
Market Case Study\). More detailed information such as place of origin, mode of  
travel, etc. can be put on a simple questionnaire and attached to the ticket, to be  
filled in if the visitor wishes and placed in a box near the exit\(s\). Large numbers  
of questionnaire replies are not needed to gather this kind of information\: if only  
100 questionnaires were returned \(note the limitations of doing this without a  
representative control sample that preferably includes some non-attendees to find  
out why they didn’t come\), this would still be enough for a modest analysis of the  
information, and is not too much to collate and write up in a short Visitor Atten-  
dance Report. Gathering this information will help you promote the event in the  
right places next time.  
# Details of spending and use patterns  
How much was spent, and what on? How many people did what, and when? This  
kind of information helps you find out what aspects were most popular. Your event  
might have included several different components or activities \(the product service  
mix\), and in the next edition you might want to add or remove some of them,  
or make some of them better, or try out new layouts or locations. To do this you  
need information on what components of the event people are using and what is  
popular. This information can be obtained from spot checks and from sampling  
elements such as queue lengths at given times. More detailed information can be  
found from ticket sales, and from sales records of catering or other activities. Even  
where no money changes hands, volunteers can count the number of people using  
parts of the event, or visitors can be given tokens or ticket strips \(carnet strips\)  
to hand in at the various locations, activities or stands as they use them. These  
can be counted, or just weighed. Gathering this information will help you decide  
what parts of your event are most popular, and which should be kept or changed  
next time.

# Visitors to the Geneva Motor Show, March 2018  
FACTBOX  
• Geneva International Motor Show  
• Attracts over 660,000 visitors from 87 different countries  
• 4,700 journalists attended  
• In 2018 there were 178 exhibitors covering 73,000 square metres  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider the usefulness of information collected during an event  
about its visitors with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the break-down of some basic information collected at an event about its visitors.  
• To apply the understanding of the need to collect marketing information which might then be  
used to market future editions.  
• To examine whether all events should collect information.  
**T** he Geneva International Motor Show, with its  
88th edition in March 2018, attracts a huge  
number of exhibitors and visitors to the Palexpo  
Halls in Geneva. The show lasts for 11 days and  
includes not only car exhibits, but equipment and  
components, events and interactive displays. It is  
one of a series of motor shows throughout Europe,  
each country being allowed one International Motor  
Show, as well as domestic shows and dealer exhibi-  
tions. Past Geneva shows have been of such impor-  
tance that they have been opened by the President  
of Switzerland and the President of the Council of  
State, with attendance by other major political fig-  
ures and celebrities at the opening ceremonies.

The 11-day event takes more than two weeks to  
set up inside the exhibition hall, from the initial layout  
of where the respective stands will be, through the  
construction of the stand shells \(exhibition booths\),  
the delivery of exhibitors’ stand equipment, the  
fitting of power and lighting, the arrival of major  
exhibits – including the cars, which are covered  
with tarpaulins – to the final fitting-out of the stands  
with furniture and promotional materials ready for  
the opening day. This sequence of construction can  
be seen in a series of development pictures on the  
motor show website.

# Discussion Questions  
**1** Identify how the break-down of visitor informa-  
tion can be useful in marketing terms.  
**2** Examine an event for which you can obtain  
visitor information\: How can this information  
be used for marketing purposes? What kind  
of details would it be especially useful to know  
about the visitors at the event, if you had a fur-  
ther edition to prepare for a coming year?  
**3** Clearly, large-scale events collect visitor infor-  
mation in various ways, \(in what ways?\) but  
do all events do this and if not, why not? Do  
you need to collect marketing data at\: A.  
a private dinner party, B. a single one-time  
only music event, C. an annual village flower  
show?

# Marketing effectiveness  
What parts of the marketing, publicity and public relations effort were successful?  
It is quite common for people to be asked on a questionnaire, ‘How did you find  
out about us?’ You can ask this by getting people to tick boxes on a questionnaire  
\(‘Advert in the newspaper; Advert on the radio’, etc.\), – but, bearing in mind what  
has just been discussed about how people decide and what influences them, it would  
better to do this through informal chats with visitors. These can, in fact, be loosely  
structured by writing down a few short questions and using them as a guide during  
each chat. Following the chat, write out the responses on a summary sheet \(just a

# Epica performing live at Norway Rock Festival  
FACTBOX  
• Epica is a Dutch gothic metal band  
• The band was founded by Mark Jansen  
• Known for their symphonic sound  
• The band plays throughout Europe and the world  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the usefulness of social media in marketing terms, with the  
following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which social media may support the more traditional marketing methods.  
• To highlight how this type of media is used.  
• To understand issues about social media which might result in an organisation getting unusual  
publicity or unexpected public relations outcomes.  
**E** pica, a Dutch gothic metal band, originating  
in Reuver in Limburg, has six members who  
perform in a style which might be described as a  
blend of progressive, gothic and symphonic metal.  
Their music is aggressive, bombastic and exces-  
sive, with some songs being described as epic,  
grand and majestic and others being described  
as more subdued and introspective. The band  
also uses larger forces in outdoor concerts \(as  
opposed to studio music\) including choirs and  
orchestras. They were founded in 2002–2003 by  
Mark Jansen.

# 199  
Epica uses a range of traditional marketing tech-  
niques and social media to promote their work, both  
in terms of live performances and recorded music.  
Their website demonstrates this mix of techniques  
with links to venues for gig dates, tickets and for  
information about the performances and the ven-  
ues. Social media plays a major role in terms of their  
fanbase and spreading the word about Epica. The  
website enables fans and supporters to feedback  
what they think, to raise issues and be positive \(or  
otherwise\) about what Epica are doing. The chatroom  
enables fans and others to engage with each  
other and learn what is going on or what might be  
happening.  
Social networks such as MySpace and Twitter  
have official Epica pages, as do Facebook and  
other networks. Taking Facebook as the example,  
Epica can be seen and liked by huge numbers of  
people \(1.3 million likes, rather more than ‘liked’  
the last thing most of the rest of us posted!\). As  
with all things Facebook, there is a tendency for  
most users to be supportive of what’s going on,  
but as Facebook users know themselves, posting  
a status sometimes generates strange or obscene  
responses.  
In terms of public relations, any organisation  
using social media, and most now do so, involves  
just as much time, effort and care as any other form  
of activity. Social media can be very supportive of an  
organisation, but can also be very critical and it is  
essential that an organisation has a member of staff  
with a management responsibility for engagement  
and oversight. Sometimes the use of social media  
can result in big, and occasionally, quite unpleasant  
surprises for organisations, notably where the man-  
agement of such organisations has lost contact with  
the reality of the world as seen through the eyes of  
its supporters and perhaps the public, and there are  
examples where this has had a big impact on what  
an organisation chose to do.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** How does Epica use social media?  
**2** Is social media a generally positive activity and  
why is this?  
**3** How do organisations gauge whether social  
media feedback is of major importance and  
how should organisations provide oversight of  
what is happening in the virtual world?  
**4** Are there costs attached to running or oversee-  
ing social media activities?

list – chat 1, chat 2, etc.\). You will be surprised what you learn and, most importantly,  
this gives people the opportunity to tell you more about what they did and how they  
found out about you, than if you had given them a list \(provided you use open-ended  
questions, such as ‘How did you get here?’, rather than ‘yes/no’ questions, ‘Did you  
come by car?’\). Gathering this information will help you find out what part of your  
marketing effort was the most useful, and how you could improve it.  
# Expectations and satisfaction  
What did your visitors expect and were they happy with their experience, i.e. did  
your event fulfil their expectations? Like the effectiveness assessment of marketing,  
checking expectation and satisfaction is probably best done by talking to people. This  
helps to explore their expectations in a way that would probably not be expressed  
in a questionnaire. Be careful how you formulate questions. For example, it is very

common in a restaurant to be asked, ‘Is everything all right?’ Remember what we  
said about asking open-ended questions, as the response to this is almost certainly  
‘Yes, it’s fine.’ This is, first, because the question is framed in a yes/no way, and  
second, because it is socially difficult for people to respond to such a question by  
saying, ‘No. The food is terrible, the service is slow, the carpet is sticky and the toi-  
lets smell’ \(or whatever\). Therefore, in exploring whether your visitors are satisfied  
you need to think carefully about what you will ask them and how, and also what  
opportunities there are during your event when visitors will be socially comfortable  
to answer questions. Although we may not use questionnaires during the event itself,  
it is probably a useful exercise to give people some to take away, or mail some out a  
day or two later, in order to obtain opinions after the event or after people have had  
time to reflect. Clearly, the most useful purpose in getting satisfaction information is  
to help identify strengths and weaknesses and to help grow the potential number of  
visitors attending by knowing what went well and what didn’t.

# Summary  
**M** arketing is attractive to many people as an interesting and  
stimulating activity, one that they enjoy doing. However, as  
with the other components of events management, from logistics to  
finance, it requires a high level of skills to undertake it properly. Sound  
knowledge of the kind of people who will attend an event, whether as  
participants, visitors or guests, is essential to promoting it and ensuring  
its success. This knowledge helps the event marketer understand how  
to raise awareness, advertise, promote, improve an image or maintain  
the event’s impact in the media. Part of the marketing function is also to  
evaluate how an event is received. Sometimes this is done as an event  
is progressing, sometimes by feedback at the end. In those cases where  
there will be a further edition, the knowledge gained from evaluation  
should enable improvements or changes to be made for the future.

# Introduction  
This chapter considers some of the issues which an event coordinator, managing com-  
mittee or other responsible person must take into consideration in order to ensure, as  
far as possible, safe event activities for all those involved. The planning process for  
an event must take into account all the aspects of management which bear upon our  
legal duties and these aspects include risk management, official licences and permis-  
sions, general and specific health and safety issues and insurance matters.  
Although risk management tends to be regarded as the mechanism by which we  
attempt to be aware of those things which could go wrong at an event or venue and  
for which we should make plans or take steps to prevent or mitigate those risks,  
‘Risks’ are really things that don’t turn out as one expected them to. Attracting more  
visitors than you expected can be just as damaging as attracting too few.  
Risks tend to fall more or less into four groups\:  
# 1  
Economic Risks \(such as financial losses or lack of sponsorship or grant support\)  
**2** Performance Risks \(such as the failure of an event to take place due to, say,  
booked entertainers or competitors not turning up\)  
**3** Psychological Risks \(such as a location, venue or previous similar event having  
a poor reputation\), and  
**4** Physical Risks \(that is, danger to the public or participants; health and safety  
problems; or crisis, crime and security difficulties \(Tarlow, 2014\)\)  
In terms of legalities, while there are some aspects of law and legislation that are  
Europe-wide, many issues in terms of the legalities of an event may vary from country  
to country and region to region, so events managers need to have an understanding  
of their national and local legal requirements. These requirements are likely to cover  
licencing issues, such as the licences needed for the sale of alcohol or the sale of  
food; also performance licences, perhaps for music or other entertainment; matters  
of copyright \(especially for music\); legal requirements for a wide range of health and  
safety issues ranging from Food Hygiene to Crowd Safety; contractual arrangements  
between the organisers, promoter, client or venue and their suppliers, local authori-  
ties, broadcasters, and so on; as well as insurance requirements for a whole range of  
issues, from employers’ liabilities to public safety.  
# Risk management  
Although the media tends to be dominated by recent events, the scale and scope of  
risk have not changed. Indeed, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation has  
often reminded us that the risks people look for seem to be driven as much by recent  
concerns as by any realistic appraisal of coming challenges, although one of the func-  
tions of Emergency Planning is to attempt to look forward \(Alexander 2016\). Hence,  
the tragedy at the 2010 Love Parade \(BBC 2010\) echoed the 1883 tragedy at Victorian  
Hall, Sunderland \(SPLS, 2012\) and the 1896 Khodynka Field tragedy \(Timelines,  
2012\) or any number of similar tragedies since. Consequently, events managers need  
to adopt realistic approaches \(Bladen et al., 2018\). More than ever, the events man-  
ager must address the possibility that something might go wrong at an event; seeking  
to identify potential risks and taking steps to reduce or mitigate them; as a starting  
point for producing contingency plans and emergency procedures. Although we will  
concentrate on risk as a threat to safety, it is important to recognise that the more

general approach of risk management \(Parry et al., 2004\) is to look at any aspect of a  
project or activity to identify its risks. In this more holistic approach, the risk inherent  
in putting up a marquee is that, as well as the chance it might fall down on top of 200  
guests, it might not arrive at all. Perhaps the marquee company went bankrupt and  
forgot to tell you – so, what contingency is available in the event of that type of risk?  
\(A contact name and number for another marquee company and event insurance.\)  
Event organisers need to balance by offering the best achievable duty of care to  
visitors and staff with maintaining a sense of proportion. This tension cannot be  
overstated, and it is critical that you as an organiser wrestle with it early on, or it will  
prevent you doing your job effectively. The first meeting about risks that an event  
coordinator might hold with an organising committee might raise a long list of poten-  
tially dire consequences for a simple activity \(think of the potential dangers of boiling  
a kettle\); but there are established ways of putting such risks into some kind of context  
and evaluating them \(Getz and Page, 2016\). The media can be seen, increasingly, as  
taking an unpleasant delight in highlighting the downside of issues and exaggerating  
worst case scenarios, so that an appropriate response is required. The purpose of risk  
management is, therefore, to help us lead our event through this minefield, by means  
of a policy of heightened awareness, assessment, evaluation, moderation and record-  
ing. Silvers \(2013\) and others deal with the detail of these issues.  
Since, as Figure 9.1 highlights, it is critical to begin with a heightened sense  
of awareness, your planning team should familiarise themselves with issues and  
approaches emerging from the general debate of risk management. Whilst it might  
be appropriate to engage a professional consultant, gaining the advice of such experts  
as the fire brigade, ambulance service, police representatives \(or specialists, e.g. for  
outdoor activities\) is a more usual starting point. More formal interviews can be held  
with the heads of department to assess risks. It is important that everyone under-  
stands the significance of doing this. The outcome of careful risk management might  
be to save someone’s life. You are then likely to be faced with a choice of approach,  
either fairly conceptual or broadly processual, in deciding the best way forward  
for your specific event. Those favouring the conceptual approach would argue that  
flawed thinking is as dangerous as flawed policy; hence you would do well to try and  
place your critical risks in a table such as Figure 9.2.

Figure 9.2 Various risk categories  
Technical Risk  
The risk that an event as it is proposed can’t be delivered or won’t work. This may  
include things like a risk to staff and others, poor health and safety, hazards, dangerous  
substances, shortages of materials, time, equipment and other resources, as well as  
failures in transport, deliveries, etc.  
Management Risk  
The risk that an event cannot be achieved because there is neither the management  
availability nor the inherent skills people need to do it. This may include things like  
disorganisation, inadequate qualifications, team failure, inexperience or lack of key staff.  
Requirements Risk  
The risk that an event is not properly specified \(scope or objectives\) or understood in  
the way it was meant to be provided. This is where the key players at the beginning, that  
is the clients or the initial key stakeholders, were not clear about what they wanted or  
how they foresaw the outcome.  
Acceptance Risk  
The risk that an event will not be acceptable to the person\(s\) or organisation\(s\) paying for  
it or receiving it, that is to say that no-one likes your event, it gets a bad reception  
or no-one attends, that is to say a risk of expectations not being fulfilled.  
Environment Risk  
The risk that an event may fail because something in the environment has not been  
properly understood\: culture, attitudes, security, timing, marketing \(not understanding  
the marketing environment\), issues of overcrowding \(excess demand and failure to plan  
for a safe response\), etc.  
The advantages of such an approach are that it is less likely to downplay such  
unlikely but high profile risks as a terrorist outrage, and that it groups risks by their  
most likely management response, e.g. transferring the risk to an insurance company  
or outsourcing its management. The disadvantages are that it requires a fair amount  
of management focus and still requires decisions as to practical processes. When  
judging Severity and Probability \(as in Figure 9.3\), you will find it a lot easier if you  
use a logarithmic scale, much like the Richter Scale for earthquakes, in which each  
whole number on the scale represents a ten-fold increase in the earthquake’s severity.  
In 2011 a volcanic ash cloud grounded European flights \(BBC, 2011\); fitting these on

the same scale as guests at a dinner receiving a cold meal when it should have been  
hot will prove tricky, unless you use the Richter Scale approach, in which case you  
can easily fit all types of potential risk onto a single sheet of paper.  
Take a moment to see if you can fit the full range of risks likely to face your event  
into the framework in Figure 9.3. For example, did you remember to include fraud?  
If so, are you sure that it will be as frequent, or as severe as you think? Look at  
the largest risk that you intend to insure\: will the insurance company pay as much  
\(or as quickly\) as you think? If not, could you still host the event? Which risks are  
the most difficult to position? Would more information help or does the severity/  
probability of these risks vary over time?  
Those preferring a more process-driven approach may well favour the widely used  
practice of multiplying a risk’s probability ‘score’ with its severity ‘score’, to derive a  
ranking for that risk. This seems a sound approach but, for the reasons given already,  
needs great care if the results are not to become hopelessly flawed. Greater interpreta-  
tion might be required and issues such as ‘Time Impact’ and ‘Cost Impact’ considered  
which require a mitigation strategy – so that you might be able to quantify ‘Quality  
Impact’ for your own event and enhance the approach still further.  
Having dealt with the criticality of addressing the appropriate scope and detail of the  
likely risks facing your event, we propose a very simplistic risk management table, in  
Figure 9.4, to help you address the mechanics of working through a Risk Assessment.

In either case, this process should  
also be seen as ongoing, as anyone  
who feels they have identified a risk,  
perhaps whilst some activity is tak-  
ing place, must be able to flag that  
risk and have it dealt with imme-  
diately. For this reason, all events  
should have an appointed Safety  
Officer, who has the power to stop  
an activity on the spot, or to order  
the necessary resources to sort it out,  
and has contact lists for the events  
team and for the emergency and

is a small regional kite-flying championship, which happens to be taking place next to a  
cricket ground on the same day as a cricket match. Hence, there are some limited risks  
attached to objects flying through the air. The event does not attract large numbers of  
spectators, so overcrowding in the arena area of the championship is not thought a  
major risk. The catering tent is small, and in bad weather could get quite crowded, and  
with many people in it, as well as quite a lot of catering equipment. In this particular  
event, it has a somewhat higher risk associated with overcrowding than the main arena.  
Naturally, each event is different, and the impact must be assessed individually.  
The risk management of an event takes place in several linked stages\: first, the  
assessment; second, the evaluation, which results in the preparation of the risk mod-  
eration form; third, the control measures, which also stem from the risk moderation  
form, but which may lead either to special preparations before the event, or to special  
measures during it; finally, a recording activity, particularly important where a fur-  
ther edition might take place, and especially so if other risks were identified during  
the event itself. These need particularly careful recording and review, as they are  
often surprisingly important and are learned from experience rather than foresight.  
The implication of this last issue is that we cannot foresee everything that might  
happen at an event. In the end, although we may have taken every reasonable effort  
to manage risk, we must always be watchful for something that might still catch us  
out. It is the tendency of such minor things to trigger a cascade of events that can  
lead to disaster or unexpected and serious safety problems \(see Figure 9.6\).  
Figure 9.6 Warnings from history  
A single  
catastrophic event disaster  
A limited number of  
events with minor injuries or reportable issues  
Many events with tens of  
‘near miss’ type slight injuries or incidents, often unreported  
Thousands of unsafe acts or fleeting moments where an accident could have,  
but didn’t occur, were unobserved or unconsidered  
In many cases organisations and managers do not learn from history, they are insufficiently  
knowledgeable of historic events or accidents and some organisations do not consider the wider  
environment or their ethical and social responsibilities within it. Often, when things go wrong,  
there are no senior managers present or contactable and no means of directing mitigation measures  
until emergency services arrive, by which time, a disaster may have overtaken the event.  
In such cases what will make the difference between containing a disaster or witnessing total  
chaos will be staff training\: all staff should have some emergency training in response to known  
issues and be aware of how to recognise \(for example\) crowd or individual distress.

In assessing the risk at events, our initial judgement of what is involved can be  
based, at least in part, on existing practice and on an awareness of what constitutes  
the routine and predictable and what does not. For example, we might consider  
the level of risk to vary according to the type of event and the activities that will  
take place\:  
• Low-risk events Typically, these are indoor events, which, whilst not completely  
regular or routine, are nearly so, and involve no unusual or specialist activities.  
The people involved \(both organisers and participants or attendees\) are well  
within their range of experience, and there is already considerable expertise and  
experience amongst management and staff. Examples might be banquets and  
dinners, either indoors or in marquees.  
• Medium-risk events These might be very large indoor events, in locations that  
the public might not attend regularly, or that are rather outside their range of  
experiences \(but that a significant number of the attendees, management and  
staff have experienced in similar circumstances\), where the activities are more  
complicated than normal. Alternatively, they may be outdoor, involving large  
numbers of people, but with no obvious or perceived dangerous activities.  
Examples might be large-scale sporting competitions, public shows and street  
festivals.  
• High-risk events These are events involving significantly large numbers of  
people in activities and locations they are unfamiliar with, or have never  
been to before, where there is little or no existing knowledge or experience  
of the event or of the environment amongst management, staff or emer-  
gency services. In addition, there are visible, clear and evident dangers of  
undertaking the event or participating in it, if the safety features are ignored  
or are inadequate. Examples might be high speed racing events, large-scale  
complicated open-air events taking place for the first time \(hence public and  
staff unfamiliarity\), and small-scale events such as corporate outdoor team-building  
activities, where the safety rules and the knowledge of experienced  
staff are the key to safety, but risky for those without experience, expertise or  
qualifications.  
Event managers and coordinators should strive to ensure that they not only pro-  
vide a safe event and a safe environment for all concerned, but also that the systems  
and emergency procedures are in place in case of an accident or other problem aris-  
ing. In all events, but especially high-risk events, the need for adequate and sufficient  
staff training, especially of volunteers, is absolutely vital.  
# 211  
# Plans and mAPs  
Part of the process of providing information for the public for a large or outdoor  
event will probably be the preparation of a scale or sketch map or plan of the site.  
Such plans can have a number of uses, one of which may be to assist the risk assess-  
ment process.  
Maps have several advantages; they are a useful tool for the management and  
planning of an event insofar as they can be used to assess the site, its advantages and  
disadvantages, as well as plan where the various attractions or focal points may be

# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to understand the need for risk assessments in relation to a range of  
safety issues which impact on events.  
• To bring into perspective the differences between the public and media perception of threats  
with the reality of known historic and modern event disasters.  
• To consider that many events, from local dog shows to large-scale festivals, do not have the  
same level of risk, even if the different kinds of events might have a risk or risks unique to each.  
**S** afety has long been a concern and an import-  
ant management task for event and venue  
managers. There is a considerable background  
of material related to safety issues ranging from  
the need to mitigate against small accidents to  
the need to mitigate against large-scale disasters.  
Any kind of event has the potential for accident  
or injury, even the most innocuous kind of event\:  
you could accidentally drop a plate of food at your  
auntie’s dinner party and then cut yourself picking

up the broken plate. It is important to bear in mind  
that, whilst we take reasonable steps to prevent  
accidents or dangerous crimes, no human activ-  
ity can be rendered so safe that it is without risk,  
even if that risk is infinitesimally small. Consider,  
for example, the risks which might ensue from the  
following kinds of events\: dog shows; fireworks  
displays; garden parties and fetes; indoor exhi-  
bitions; indoor sports; outdoor sports; airshows;  
road races and marathons; woodland walks; young  
person’s discos.  
We can see then, that as Event Managers, we  
should take steps to mitigate or contain risks and  
reduce the opportunities for activities to be unsafe  
or to cause accidents or injuries. In most cases this  
involves safety planning of one kind or another and  
that we should put in place the physical or other  
measures which help reduce the potential for prob-  
lems, with training of staff being especially important.  
In some cases, at large-scale or high profile events,  
security planning and security risk assessment are  
also required.  
It is about 20 years since the well-remembered  
disaster at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark in  
2,000, where nine people died in a crowd crush  
in the **moshpit**, yet even that disaster showed  
that emergency measures had been put in place,  
and even if some of them had failed, not all of  
them did. The festival continued after the disaster  
because it was known that letting 90,000 peo-  
ple attempt to get out of the festival ground all  
at once was as dangerous as the failure to con-  
trol the crowd in the moshpit had been. Since  
that disaster crowd management has improved  
enormously and lessons have been learned which  
inform our safety decisions now and in the future,  
provided such lessons are not forgotten. Most  
governments and local councils produce Event  
Safety Guides, such as the MSB Event Safety  
Guide produced by the Swedish Civil Contingen-  
cies Agency \(also provided in English\), which deal  
with the approach to and understanding of safety  
issues at events.  
Not all event disasters receive the interna-  
tional publicity which Roskilde did. Indeed, some  
event disasters are almost forgotten even though  
the number of deaths or injuries was far beyond  
what we may remember from recent times. The  
largest known recent event disaster occurred  
in 2004 at the Cromanon Rock Club in Buenos  
Aires where, out of a crowd of 3,000 people, 194  
died and half the audience were badly injured in  
a fire which engulfed the venue during the perfor-  
mance. Of the ten most serious event disasters in  
the last 40 years or so, fire has been the biggest  
threat and the biggest killer\: After the Cromanon,  
the list reads\: The Cabaret Room at the Bever-  
ley Hills Supper Club in Cincinnati, 165 deaths  
due to fire \(1977\); Stations Nightclub watching  
the band ‘Great White’ in West Warwick, USA,  
100 deaths due to fire \(2003\); Santika Nightclub  
in Bangkok, 100 deaths due to fire \(2009\); Love  
Parade in Duisburg, Germany, 21 deaths due to  
overcrowding, crowd crush and panic in a tunnel  
\(2010\); Mawazine Festival in Rabat, Morocco, 11  
deaths due to people being crushed at the exits  
coming out \(2009\); Cincinnati Riverfront Stadium  
at a planned performance of the band ‘The Who’,  
11 deaths due to people being crushed at the  
entrances going in \(1979\); Roskilde Festival, nine  
deaths due to crowd control failure in the mosh-  
pit \(2,000\); Alamont Free Concert, San Francisco,  
four deaths, of which one was a murder, two were  
from a hit-and-runs and another was from drown-  
ing \(1969\); Taman Anggrek Shopping ­ Centre,  
Jakarta, watching the band ‘A1’, four deaths  
in a stampede for the exits caused by crowd  
panic \(2001\).  
The news media is not always informative about  
our understanding of potential threats and often  
concentrates on things which frighten the public  
or which reflect media interest or obsessions at the  
time. For this reason, crimes such as terrorism often  
attract greater media attention than other issues and  
consequently this means that equally genuine safety  
issues may not receive the attention they deserve  
because the media wants us to be interested in  
something else. However, this is not always the  
case\: some media reports are accurate and insight-  
ful, but not all are.  
Terrorism is a serious matter in major event  
planning and a number of events have suffered

from attacks over time. The Manchester Arena was  
bombed during an Ariana Grande concert in 2017,  
with 22 deaths and 250 injured, and in considerable  
relevance to the issue of event management, the  
safety response was highly criticised. In particular,  
the Manchester Fire Brigade, which was instructed  
not to attend the scene when the alarm bells rang  
because of ‘risk aversion’ on the part of its so-called  
managers and who went to an assembly point  
almost five km away, taking all their equipment with  
them\: to the extent that some of the casualties had  
to be carried out of the Arena on advertising boards  
and fence panels.  
We have noted that there have been various  
event disasters involving fire and crowd control  
issues. Terrorism has been a factor in some event  
disasters including the deaths of two people who  
were shot at an art event in Copenhagen in 2015;  
130 people were killed in Paris, mainly at a bomb-  
ing at the Stade de France during a soccer match  
between France and Germany in the same year,  
and 86 people were killed in a lorry ramming during  
the Bastille Day celebrations along the Promenade  
des Anglais in Nice in 2016. This latter case has led,  
in particular, to greater consideration of the issue  
of Hostile Vehicle Mitigation \(HVM\) but it must be  
noted that this lorry had already crashed through  
the crowd barriers, lane separators and a police  
car at the beginning of the rampage. In short, the  
event organisers had done what they reasonably  
could to secure the event area. The driver was shot  
by the police, after quite a large number of people  
had attempted to stop the lorry or divert its course.  
In many respects as Event Managers, we need  
a wider perspective on safety and security issues,  
because to concentrate on those issues which hit  
the headlines may blind us to other crucial threats  
which have a *greater probability* of impacting our  
event, especially if our event is not high profile. Such  
an example is road safety. It almost never crosses  
the media horizon, but is quite deadly. In the UK  
alone in 2016 there were 1,792 deaths on the roads  
and almost 180,000 injuries. We might argue that  
Event Managers should have an awareness of how  
people travel to and from our events and whether  
we have measures in place which ensure that peo-  
ple attending or visiting are careful in our car parks,  
on our approach roads and access routes, for to  
do so might save more lives and reduce potential  
injuries around events in general from road issues,  
than from someone trying to bomb us. Nevertheless,  
all aspects are deserving of our attention where an  
event may be subject to such an identifiable risk,  
be it fire, crowd panic, terrorism, crime or any other  
of a large range of causes, both probable and  
improbable.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** How would you ensure your event is safe and  
secure\: are all events equally risky?  
**2** Does risk mitigation and risk control mean you  
have eliminated risk or that you have taken rea-  
sonable steps to do so?  
**3** If you are running a large regional music festival  
in the countryside, what might be your highest  
risk, why could this be and what steps might  
you take to address the issues?  
**4** Many events are single day activities run  
by ­ voluntary staff or staff who have low lev-  
els of safety experience. If you could impart  
only three headline safety instructions to be  
sure they would be absorbed, what might  
those be?

Fire assembly points and fire towers, emergency crowd overflow areas\*  
\* These areas may not necessarily be shown on public maps.  
The risk assessment use of these maps takes into consideration the general and  
emergency access arrangements; parking, footway routes, disabled access; emer-  
gency or help points; fire and first aid points; and location of the control point  
or organisers’ office in terms of the site in general, as well as dealing with any  
specific risk issues which might arise from sitting down and looking at the plan as  
a whole.  
For small events, plans can be done by hand and these will still act as a helpful  
tool. For larger, more professional events, plans can be prepared by computer-aided  
design \(CAD\) or similar techniques. In all cases it will be necessary to have correct  
measurements for the site and, if it has never been used before or measurements are  
not already available, then the event coordinator will need to go out with a colleague  
and take careful measurements.  
In the case of those events which are major in some way, this process may have  
to be done by professional surveyors in case blueprint plans are needed \(say if a new  
building or facility is to be put up\) or if a model of the site is required. Detailed plans  
of this kind may be needed not only by the event team but also by the contractors  
and suppliers. Indeed, lots of people may need them\: electricians and technicians, the  
emergency services and stewards, hosts and guides, coach party leaders, participants  
and exhibitors and, of course, the visitors or audience.  
# Legalities and insurance  
The difficulties that organisers of events have faced over insurance cover and the  
tragedy at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations football tournament \(Harris, 2010\) pro-  
vided a stark reminder of the need to bear in mind the large number of legalities and  
similar issues associated with undertaking an event. These include licencing, health

and safety and insurance requirements, which are the key to secure operations.  
Practices about how these are dealt with vary considerably across the European  
Union countries, making it difficult to generalise. However, permits and licences  
are generally dealt with at a local level \(town, city or district\), although a few may  
be dealt with at regional or provincial level, within a framework of national and  
European Union legislation. It will be necessary for events organisers to check locally  
to identify what legal requirements prevail for aspects such as staffing, permits,  
licences and other regulatory issues. Figure 9.8 provides some possibilities, but is by  
no means definitive.

A large waste or  
rubbish container  
that is moved by  
lorry.  
The applications procedures for these vary from country to country, so that local  
documentation should be checked for whom to apply to for permits, and what kinds  
of permits are needed \(licences for the sale of alcohol are obvious, but even the plac-  
ing of a waste **skip** on a public road may need the permission of the local authority\).  
In addition to permits and licences, requirements for insurance need sufficient time  
to be investigated with a reputable insurance broker, or with insurance companies  
specialising in the events field. Insurance, however, does have some commonality of  
approach, and various insurance companies have experience of dealing with cross  
European events. Normal events insurance would cover items such as\:  
• cancellation  
• venue operator’s bankruptcy  
• non-appearance of celebrities  
• failure to vacate the venue  
• damage to property or premises  
• legal liabilities  
• damage to equipment, and  
• public liabilities.

The aim of this case study is to consider the nature of risk management and emergency proce-  
dures with the following objectives\:  
• To consider how risks might be judged in terms of different types of events, for example, major  
outdoor events might be considered more risky than small indoor ones, but it depends on the  
type of event, so an outdoor airshow might have a greater risk than an outdoor golf tourna-  
ment \(the risk of being hit by a falling aircraft being perhaps rather greater than being hit by a  
falling golf ball\).  
• To highlight who and what organisations might be involved in emergency planning for an event.  
• To understand that even the best planning for emergencies cannot cover all possibilities\: some  
are unforeseen and unexpected.

Sea hosts a number of annual events intended  
to attract tourists. These include an annual carni-  
val, a classic vehicle show, a jazz festival, a real ale  
festival, a sci-fi convention, and its largest annual  
event, the Clacton Air Show. Such a range helps to  
stimulate tourism in a resort that relies on its family  
image, its beaches and its good weather to attract  
tourists from towns and cities in the east of England  
and from north London.  
The air show is estimated to attract some 250,000  
visitors to the town, in addition to the normal level of  
tourists. This number is very creditable when com-  
pared with some national events, such as the Henley  
Boating Regatta, which attracts 95,000 people and  
the Royal Windsor Horse Show which attracts over  
55,000 people. The economic impact of the air show  
is quite significant. It is a two-day event contributing  
about €5.5m \(an average of €22 per visitor\) to the  
local economy. Visitors to the air show spend money  
not only at the show ground, but also in local pubs  
and restaurants, shops and other retail outlets, and  
at a range of local facilities and services including the  
pier, gift shops and other local attractions.  
Many of the events that take place in the resort,  
like the air show, are organised by the local council’s  
Economic Development Department. The tourism  
section of this department is responsible for three  
main areas of activity\:  
• The promotion of the resort and the surround-  
ing area  
• The running of the town’s tourist information  
centre and other information centres in the  
district  
• The organisation and management of a number  
of larger special events, including the air show.  
The air show requires careful organisation, espe-  
cially in terms of risk management, crowd manage-  
ment, emergency services, transport and access,  
and coordination between various public service  
departments including the coastguard, the fire bri-  
gade, the police, the ambulance service and air traf-  
fic control. These are crucial, because of the large  
number of people attending and the potential dan-  
gers associated with air displays, aerobatics, para-  
chuting and similar activities, as was highlighted by  
the Shoreham Airshow crash of 2015. In addition to  
full risk analysis, the planning phase includes a series  
of briefings between the public service departments,  
the tourism officer and other council departments,  
including the Department of Emergency Planning,  
the Department of Highways and the Environmental  
Department. This is followed up by briefings to staff  
and volunteers for the event.  
For each air show, a set of emergency service  
briefing notes is prepared which state the alloca-  
tion of resources and manpower for various kinds  
of emergencies. These include back-up plans for  
dealing with emergencies ranging from an air crash  
to a bomb alert, or other types of accident, in order  
to ensure that the public is as safe as reasonably  
possible while at the show. This liaison process also  
includes coordination with the council’s own team,  
who staff information points and act as guides,  
together with a range of voluntary organisations  
such as the St John’s Ambulance Service, which  
assists the main emergency services.  
# Discussion questions  
**1** Does your town or city have a department that  
deals with tourism in general or special events  
in particular, and if so, what does it do?  
**2** What other types of events might require a  
major input from emergency services?  
**3** Do even small events require a risk analysis  
and should thought be given to emergency  
procedures?  
**4** What training should take place to ensure the  
safety of the public at an event?

FACTBOX  
• A historical re-enactment society  
• Presents historical pageants, shows and battle recreations  
• Volunteers and members of the society are involved  
• Various legal and contractual requirements are needed  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider issues of risk in terms of some legalities and insurance  
issues with the following objectives\:  
• To consider what legal and insurance issues might emerge when planning an event.  
• To highlight why certain types of event might have greater insurance implications than others.  
**E** vents activities range from the inherently safe  
to the rather dangerous. Certainly, in terms of  
public perceptions, you might feel safer at a family  
dinner party than you would be as a participant in  
the Annual International Parascending Competition,  
even though you could get run over by a bus the  
moment you left the dinner party, but might not so  
much as receive a bruise whilst parascending. But  
the nature of risk, and why an event might run or  
be cancelled, could be more complicated. Suppose  
you were the organisers of the historic battle recre-  
ation day, what risks might you want your event to  
be insured against?  
Regia Anglorum is one of a number of popular  
history or battle recreation and hobby societies  
which exist throughout Europe dealing with living

history and costumed historical re-enactment  
and entertainment, ranging from Viking Societ-  
ies in Scandinavia to Guard’s Parade Societies in  
Germany. There are many of these, such as the  
‘Sealed Knott’ an English Civil War re-­ enactment  
society; ‘Legio X Gemina’ a Dutch Roman army  
re-enactment society; the Magnus Kompanie,  
dealing with medieval combat re-enactment,  
based in Hessen-Kassell in Germany. There are  
perhaps over 500 such societies which feature  
a wide range of historical periods, locations and  
individual historic events. Regia Anglorum covers  
the predominantly Saxon period in England and  
it undertakes historic recreation shows and pag-  
eants of all kinds including battles, living history  
exhibitions, ship burning ceremonies, torchlight  
parades, and so on.  
The insurance arrangements for a battle recre-  
ation event are\:  
• Public liability cover up to €5 million  
• Employer’s liability cover for staff, including  
casual and volunteer staff  
• Cover for equipment loss or damage  
• Cancellation or abandonment cover \(including  
severe adverse weather conditions\).  
Cover for events may also include ‘financial  
cause insurance’ \(e.g. exhibitor or re-enactment  
society going broke\) and insurance for damage  
to the venue. It is also possible to cover for the  
­ non-appearance of key speakers or entertainers,  
and failure to leave the venue at the prescribed time  
\(e.g. snow blocks the venue\). Exclusions for event  
insurance typically include small items damage \(up  
to the first €400\) and in some cases, damage to  
ground/grass surface.  
The contractual arrangements for events of this  
kind usually cover headings such as\:  
Execution – that is how the re-enactment will be  
done and what main features it would comprise.  
Fees and expenses – costs that accrue to the  
client or organising committee for staging the pag-  
eant and what liabilities or insurances are covered.  
The duties of the Society or the company per-  
forming – that is issues of copyrights, provisional  
of personnel, arrangements for security, clear up,  
access, timings, water and service supplies, gen-  
eral goods and equipment supplies, camping \(often  
re-enactment groups are encamped at a pageant  
site\), publishing and promotional arrangements, pro-  
gramme and theatrical arrangements, and all related  
contractual matters.  
An outline schedule – that is, what arrives and  
when, what the basic programme is and what leaves  
and when, also any specific requirements which  
have to be fitted into the timing. For example, Regia  
Anglorum require a ton of wood per day to be deliv-  
ered to maintain the open fires used for historical  
enactments such as for cookery, ironwork forges  
and camp fires of various kinds.  
Terms of business – this section will deal with  
all associated legal issues that would be found in a  
contract, such as cancellation and payment terms.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Are the risks for this particular event unusual  
or typical?  
**2** If you were the organiser of a public carnival or  
street festival, what might the most risky activ-  
ities be, and would these be considered high,  
medium or low risk?  
**3** Is this classification of risk linked in any way to  
the nature of the insurance provision for events?  
**4** What activities might constitute high risk for  
participants and spectators?  
**5** If you have identified a need for insurance of  
your event, have you allowed for the cost of it  
in your budgets?

Apart from permits and insurance, various kinds of contracts will be needed if the  
event provides entertainers, musicians, pyrotechnologists \(fireworks\), guest speakers  
or celebrities, in order to ensure the arrangements are correctly made. Contracting  
of this kind needs to be undertaken carefully, bearing in mind that bookings for spe-  
cialists have to be made long in advance, together with some form of pre-payment,  
and arrangements in the event of cancellation of either party to the contract. Where  
such a contract is likely to be used, some legal advice should be taken, especially if  
the contract is out of the ordinary or non-standard in some way.

# Summary  
**W** e have attempted to provide an overview of some of the more  
serious issues regarding the risk management and key aspects  
of insurance, as well as of legal, health, safety and licencing requirements  
for events, or at least where to look for further information about them.  
The HSE website is especially recommended when dealing with health  
and safety issues. We have also sought to provide an overview of the  
operational activities that take place immediately prior to, and during, an  
event, noting that efficient preparation and due thought to operational  
issues will reduce the risk of something going wrong. These things said,  
in no way can every risk or potential danger be completely eliminated\: the  
world is complicated and often haphazard, as is human behaviour. The  
best that can be done is to take every reasonable precaution. No one  
can ask for more if this has been done with proper care and concern.

# Evaluation Questions  
**1** What might be the major or principal issues and  
considerations for risk management in terms of  
event planning and operations?  
**2** What licencing, health and safety, and insurance  
requirements should be taken into account when  
planning and operating events?  
**3** Do all events have a heavy burden of health,  
safety and risk requirements? For example\:  
compare the difference between those for an  
outdoor music festival and a village fair.

# 225  
# Introduction  
The purpose of this chapter is to look at events from the operational viewpoint – how  
to operate the event as a project and as an experience, and how to address some of  
the planning and organisational complexities which, whilst critical, often receive  
insufficient attention \(Smit and Melissen, 2018\).  
In setting up events, organising committees or individual event coordinators may be  
faced with a number of set-up challenges. These challenges could be viewed in terms of  
their varying levels of complexity. For a simple indoor event such as a flower show in  
a village hall, we can understand this would be fairly simple to set up\: all the services  
are available, the venue is indoors and the event itself is in no way complicated or  
unsafe, or beyond the abilities of relatively untrained people to undertake or enjoy. On  
the other hand, to stage an event in a field, or on an island, or in any location where  
services, equipment or supplies have to be brought in, will require close attention and  
planning for its effective management and operation \(Ferdinand and Williams, 2015\).  
This chapter also considers how to make the final preparations, those things  
that need to be done immediately before an event opens. These should be taken in  
conjunction with the sections about logistics and about how to run events on the  
day. The various sections overlap somewhat depending on how an event is timed  
and organised. In some cases, the preparations will happen all in one day, in others  
the groundwork may take several days or even weeks and will need to be ready well  
before the public arrives.  
# The event as a project  
There are considerable similarities between the management of projects and of events;  
so much so that many of the techniques developed in the management of large-scale  
building, logistical or public projects can be used to bring organisational discipline  
to many kinds of events \(see Figure 10.1\). Both are unique, time-limited operations.  
The application of project management techniques to events may therefore provide a  
vehicle for ensuring the modest success of an event, as opposed to a spectacular failure.  
Why only a modest success? Well, events management, rather like project management,  
can be a somewhat thankless task. The outside world does not see the event coordi-  
nator toiling away for weeks, coping with late nights, wrestling with tricky problems  
and recalcitrant suppliers to make the event a success, but the first time that the most  
minor thing goes wrong \(‘Oh dear, the flowers are red, they should be pink. . . ’\) the  
event coordinator will get the blame. Reiss \(2015\), in a usefully chatty book about proj-  
ect management, makes these points very well, and also highlights the opportunities  
a project manager may have to show how much work is going on behind the scenes.  
The management process involves very similar approaches, which the event coor-  
dinator or organising committee can seek to use. In setting objectives for an event,  
these can be tested using the SMART formula\:

If the objectives are framed or worded badly, or are confusing \(rather than specific  
and precise\), then we will have difficulty creating the event from them \(Pielichaty  
et al., 2017\). The objectives must be measurable, in terms of being able to know  
whether they are being achieved, or whether progress is being made towards them.  
This highlights the need for progress meetings and schedule deadlines. The objectives  
must be achievable; it must be genuinely possible to put on the event, especially given  
the limitations of money, staff, management or volunteer expertise that the event  
coordinator might have to contend with. Similarly, the objectives must be realistic,  
irrespective of whatever flights of fancy \(or fantasy\) the clients may want you to  
achieve. Finally, the objectives must be timely, taking into account what can be done  
in the time available, what the deadlines are and the natural tendency for timescales  
to slip. We can plan to put on a party in a tent a week from now, but are we being  
realistic? Is the timing possible? On the computer plan we have prepared it may seem  
so, but in reality, the weather may be bad, the tent erectors may take frequent coffee  
breaks, there may be a missing piece, the ground may be wet, the tent may be dirty  
and need scrubbing, the lorry delivering the poles may get stuck in the mud. . . who  
would want to be an event coordinator?  
Having tested the objectives, techniques that can be adapted from project man-  
agement include\:  
• the use of **work break-down structures**  
• project planning, including identification of **critical tasks** and **external**  
# dependencies  
**• Gantt** **charting** \(related to Critical Path Analysis\)  
• risk assessment.  
These are only a few of the possible techniques that an event organiser can adopt.  
In addition, readily available software can be obtained to assist the event organiser. If  
the event is going to be huge, then hire a project manager and get in all the computer  
software and assistance you need.

# Work breakdown structures  
A work break-down is just what it says it is\: the job broken down into its rough  
component parts. At this stage detail is not needed or expected, as the work break-  
down is simply the first stage in looking at what needs to be done, identified in its  
respective component parts by the work that one person or a related team of people  
can do. It looks rather like an organisation chart, insofar as it is hierarchical. It starts  
at the top, with the event, or major event activity, and flows down the chart to the  
point where the one person or team has been arrived at \(see Figure 10.2\).

# Project planning techniques  
There are various project planning techniques which an event coordinator could  
usefully adopt, including the identification of critical tasks and external dependen-  
cies. Once a work break-down structure has been drawn up, it should be possible  
to identify those activities that are critical to the event’s success. Critical tasks are  
essentially those functions that must be completed first, in any sequence of activities,  
for the activity to proceed. This not only helps to concentrate attention on the jobs  
within the event that are central to the task, but also provides the framework for  
setting deadlines for checking progress on event preparations, because the critical  
tasks must be completed on time for the following activities to be carried out. In the  
example of the wedding marquee, two critical tasks might be identification of the  
venue, followed by the construction of the tent. The key aspects of the construction  
are the setting up of the framework and the fitting of the external covers. Once these  
things are achieved other activities can take place. For example, once the marquee is  
weatherproof, the electrician could start installing the lighting at the same time as the  
tent erectors are still fitting the internal canvasses and curtaining. These ­ follow-on  
tasks are called dependencies. External dependencies are those issues that are outside  
the event coordinator’s direct control. Having to hire furniture for an event is an  
external dependency, as it relies on the furniture hire company turning up with the

correct items at the time and place they were ordered for. Without the furniture, there  
will be no event. Arguably, the more external dependencies a project has, and the  
more unusual they are, the more risk there is of failure.  
It is therefore necessary to turn an initial work break-down sheet into something  
that is not only more detailed, but which also shows the exact sequence of activities  
and how long each will take. This can be done on computer \(using software such  
as Microsoft Project\), or, if you had a very small event, can be done by hand using  
graph paper, but doing it by hand has the limitation that whenever you wish to add  
something while you are doing the planning, you have to redraw the chart. You  
need to identify tasks clearly enough so that you know what is going on, but not to  
over-specify them in such detail that you prevent the free thinking and association  
needed for creativity. ‘Decorate venue’ \(with due regard to safety\) may be a perfectly  
adequate statement of a task, but ‘Put green balloons one metre above the doors’ is  
probably over-specification.

# Gantt charting  
There are a range of ways in which task sequences can be shown visually. These  
include charts that show resource charting, Critical Path Analysis using **PERT** \(Pro-  
gramme Evaluation Review Technique\) charts \(suitable for the experienced, see Slack  
et al., 2001\), but the easiest and most applicable kind of chart that event organisers  
can adopt from the project management sphere is the Gantt chart. This simply shows  
the various tasks that have to be done in a time-sequence order, so that is easy to see  
what the various tasks are and, most importantly, how long they should take, when  
they should be completed and what happens if a task, especially a critical task, is  
delayed. Figure 10.3 is quite a simple Gantt chart.  
The filled boxes indicate the tasks which have been completed so far, the open  
boxes show those still to be done, so that it is easy to see how preparations are  
progressing, what is still outstanding and if any problems are emerging.  
The project started on the 1st May, and the Gantt chart example gives a snap-  
shot of the work as at 14th June. Various things were ordered and arranged at the  
beginning of the process, including the venue, marquee, furniture and caterers. Only  
one item is shown as having been ordered during the snapshot period – the flowers,  
which have a shorter lead time than, say, obtaining a marquee.  
There are some limitations to the Gantt chart. It does not show, in our example,  
the resources available to do the job or if you have given someone too much work  
to do in the time available, nor is it really suitable for large projects, as it would be  
too cumbersome. However, for the modest help it gives to planning events, it can be  
very useful, not least in that it makes the organiser\(s\) sit down and think through the  
steps needed to do the work. In some cases, this planning technique might be best  
applied backwards, that is to say, starting at the deadline \(the end\) and working back  
in order to find out how long doing something will really take. Do not come along  
and say, ‘Hey, we’ve got three days to get the tent up and sorted, just cram it onto the  
chart. . . ’. The other important activity that Gantt charting will compel you to do is  
to find out how long things genuinely take to do. Without this accurate information,  
the chart will be useless. For example, will it really take two days to get the outer  
canvas on the marquee? In our example, it does. If you have ordered a marquee, ask  
the tent erectors how long it really will take them.

# Ticketing and pre-booking issues  
When setting up an event, it is very easy to become deeply involved in the weight  
of effort and detail needed to get it off the ground, and for public events, the effort  
and the excitement of promoting it. The marketing activity, according to received  
wisdom, is about ascertaining customer needs, tailoring the product or service as  
closely as possible to meet those needs, persuading the customer to satisfy his or  
her needs, and finally, ensuring the product or service is easily accessible when the  
customer wishes to purchase it. The organiser of special events should take careful  
note of the last point. If there is a common failing in events organisation, it is often  
at the beginning of the delivery stage, and that delivery stage starts with enquiries  
and the issue of tickets.

For all its modern complexity, the final piece of the events jigsaw, the buying, that  
is, the purchase of tickets, still depends on one element – the visitor looking on your  
website, making a booking or picking up the phone and wanting a ticket, or walking  
in and paying for it. It is true that the purchase may mean texting you, emailing you,  
using the internet, or even sending someone along with a wad of cash on the bus,  
but it is still down to someone showing an interest in the event, and that display of  
interest has to be responded to efficiently and effectively.  
Setting up a system to deal with enquiries and sell tickets might be as simple as  
putting your phone number on the posters for the village fête and getting the bar  
staff to sell them from the village pub. In all probability, though, for those events for  
which the public can buy tickets, you need to give some careful thought to making  
it easy for them. Do not exclude part of your potential target market by making it  
difficult, or impossible, for them to get the tickets or make the booking they want to.  
Ideally, you should have as many ways of selling tickets and as many outlets \(besides  
the central enquiry and ticket office\) as you can imaginatively think of and can rea-  
sonably service. That is to say, you must be able to supply outlets with tickets, to  
monitor what is being sold, and to react to increased sales at any one point by being  
able to increase the allocation, if that is reasonable given the number of people you  
can admit \(or have seats for, within the capacity of the venue\). A central computer at  
your main office, with a software programme such as ‘TicketPro’ or similar, should  
be able to cope with these demands easily and perhaps also, if a system has been set  
up, to report daily sales physically and via your website or app.  
In setting up your advance ticket sales, there is no reason not to use various  
methods and channels. If your main method is from your own central ticket office,  
then think about how the weight of demand can be reduced if you have other sales  
channels, such as selling tickets online. On the other hand, you might decide you have  
a big event to prepare and only modest expertise, in which case the activity could be  
contracted to a ticketing agency, which will earn a small commission from each ticket  
they sell, but relieve you of the whole activity. Finally, you might have an event where  
the number of tickets is strictly limited for genuine reasons, and in such a case, one  
central office, with carefully considered limitations, might have to be your solution.  
Taking tickets ‘on the door’ also requires a little forethought. The most important  
issue is whether your ‘door’ will be able to cope with the demand. If only 20 peo-  
ple turn up, no problem. But what if 2,000 come? What do we know about selling  
tickets ‘on the door’? What we know, from research done in cinemas \(which need to  
have quite good ‘on the door’ systems\) is that the average time taken to \(manually\)  
process a ticket request from a member of the public is about 20 seconds. A little  
simple maths shows that 2,000 members of the public waiting at your \(narrow\)  
gate for tickets for your evening extravaganza would progress at three per minute,  
totalling almost 670 minutes – eleven hours. You need more gates, more ticket sellers  
and more people to deal with the odd enquiries that block up the system, especially  
if ticket machines are being used and the public is unfamiliar with them \(different  
designs are often puzzling if you are used to a particular type and some machines are  
extremely badly designed or stupid to use, which will slow everyone down\).  
It should be remembered that tickets not only act as evidence of payment or per-  
mission to enter an event, but are also a means of security. Tickets should be checked  
as visitors arrive for various reasons\: to ensure that they are properly directed to their  
seat; to ensure that the ticket itself is genuine; perhaps to exchange the ticket for some  
other evidence of entry or means of obtaining services, such as wristbands \(different  
colours of which may represent entitlement to entry or use of, say, VIP or media

areas\). However, once again, remember that a ticket and wristband may effectively  
perform the same function\: do not duplicate it unnecessarily. If you issue tickets and  
then issue wristbands as well, you are probably doubling the check-in time – this  
time wasting may result in huge queues or slow public entry down so much that you  
cannot get enough people through the doors fast enough – an issue which has nearly  
resulted in the collapse of several big events. Collecting tickets is also a means of  
confirming the number of people who actually attended and can be used to check  
attendance against revenue.  
In effect, ticketing is a control mechanism. It not only tells you how many peo-  
ple have attended \(or will attend\), it is a means of visitor management, because it  
enables you to control capacity; thus enabling you to ensure the safety of the public  
and participants and stay within the carrying limits of the venue, either because of  
the finite maximum number of seats or places available, or simply the venue size,  
limitations of the permitted licence or possibly because the venue itself might need to  
be protected \(such as a historic building or conservation area\). Tickets may be colour-  
coded \(we have noted\) to limit or enable access to various parts of a site or venue, and  
time specific tickets may enable you to control numbers and throughput of visitors  
during the day or during times of high demand, so managing queuing, access pinch  
points or enabling you to spread arrivals or departures of large numbers of people.  
Advance booked tickets crucially may provide your event with the income it needs to  
take place and also help you deal with issues such as group bookings or people who  
wish to be seated together, or who have some other seating or locational need, such  
as to be near disabled facilities or access. In addition, pre-booked and some other  
forms of tickets may provide useful marketing information in terms of data capture  
\(that is, for example, people providing address information which may be used for  
later relationship marketing activities\) \(see Figure 10.4\). A useful overview of event  
ticketing is provided by Beavan and Laws \(2011\).

The process of booking for events varies depending on the type of event and the  
target market. Online booking or reservation systems are a feature of many types of  
event, especially for organisational events, conferences, seminars, etc. Online ticketing  
systems are a feature of all kinds of public, sporting and cultural events, festivals,  
concerts and performance events. Booking or ticketing can be achieved in two ways\:  
**1** by personal visit, telephone, post, text or email to the organisers’ booking or  
ticket office itself or to an agent’s office  
**2** by booking through the online booking or ticket section of the event website  
or through an agent’s website dealing with the ticketing of that event.

With conferences, seminars or organisational events, potential delegates are  
informed what the preferred method of booking is, and they are encouraged to do  
this in preference to any other method. Clearly, if this is a conference, not a public  
event, there is no ‘booking’ on the day at the entrance, because final numbers are  
needed for room layouts, meal ordering, etc. beforehand. This approach to booking  
has the advantage of administrative efficiency, since all bookings go to one central  
location where they can be coordinated and confirmed online, allowing organisers  
to check the status of bookings in real time, on a common system, without having  
to check through and count individual correspondence. The system has the further  
advantage of saving staff time, as the potential delegate fills in their requirements  
on a standard online form. It is typically used where no money changes hands at  
the start of the event from individuals \(that is to say, the individual’s organisation  
or employer might be paying for their place at the conference and the payment  
for that place might be invoiced to the employer before or after the event, so the  
system in this case is effectively for the registration of a place, not for the buying  
of a ticket.  
The concept of ‘pre-booking’ is not suitable for every potential visitor. It cannot be  
used on its own for the full range of sporting or festival-type events, as some people  
will always make a decision about attending shortly before the event and will buy a  
ticket on the gate \(reasons for just turning up vary\: but the ‘just turn up’ approach  
has the major and important personal advantage that it is flexible in terms of peo-  
ple’s changing short-term plans and their view of what they might want to do on any  
given day, depending on their likes or dislikes, their mood or the weather\). So, too,  
with many voluntary and charitable events, public open events, and so on, where  
the equipment and systems may not exist to deal with any kind of pre-booking, nor  
might the potential target market have access to online systems or even be computer  
literate. On the other hand, small events such as birthday parties can be ‘pre-booked’  
in the strict sense of the word by those using social media. For example, Facebook  
allows you to invite your friends to an event you have organised. This comes with a  
caveat though. Not everyone uses the same kinds of social media, even amongst one’s  
direct friends – there will always be someone you have to text or call or say hello to  
face-to-face, and people may not turn up who say they will.  
For these reasons, event organisers must think carefully about the ticketing and  
booking systems they wish to set up in relation to their target markets and the usual  
way in which those target markets might buy a ticket or pay the entrance fee for an  
event. Equally, systems must be set up to support the booking process, by way of  
recording, dealing with enquiries, controlling total numbers, monitoring demand and  
gathering market research data.  
# Operational activities  
The big day is almost upon us, we have done as much planning as was needed, we  
have organised all the various people, parts, organisations, supplies and equip-  
ment that we planned for, it’s six in the morning and time to throw ourselves out  
of bed with enthusiasm and get the tea or coffee on. This is not a joke. You are  
going to be awfully busy on the big day, and you might have little or no chance  
to eat and drink; if that happens you become dehydrated and your blood sugar  
levels fall, you become poor at decision-making, and you won’t notice problems  
quickly enough. So, make the time, have a decent breakfast or other meal before

FACTBOX  
# London Olympics  
• Ticket sales made online in three phases  
• Tickets covered attendance both at events and for visitors to the Olympic Park  
• In the final phase of ticket selling just under one million tickets were available  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider the difficulties of very large-scale ticket sales operations at  
the London Olympics, with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which the event and associated ticket sales were made.  
• To highlight how heavy demand affected the ticketing system.  
• To understand issues of ticketing and to apply them to smaller scale events.  
**T** he London Olympics of 2012 was the larg-  
est sporting event held in the UK that year,  
although it was one of the series of Olympic events  
held every four years around the world. In the UK,  
prior experience of large-scale sporting events  
existed, notably the Manchester Commonwealth  
Games, but the scale of the Olympics required  
an almost entirely new infrastructure. One of the  
elements of this infrastructure was the mechanism  
for selling tickets.  
Ticket sales had been placed in the hands  
of experienced agent ‘Ticketmaster’, and this  
approach was no doubt based on the need to  
use systems and staff which had been effectively  
already tested, at least in part, through frequent  
use at other events, not just sporting events but

also fairs and festivals. Tickets were sold in three  
phases for different elements of the Games. The  
spreading of ticket sales over several days was  
an attempt to overcome the problem of the rush  
for tickets overwhelming the booking system, so  
that spreading the ticket sales also spread the load  
on the system to stop it crashing due to weight of  
demand.  
This approach was also to try to enable those  
who had failed to get tickets in earlier phases to  
obtain them, although bear in mind that to do this  
a ticketing system has to be relatively sophisticated  
and this may have implications for how data are  
recorded. At the time of the London Olympics data  
protection was not really identified as a major issue,  
but more recent public scandals \(such as the 2018  
Facebook – Cambridge Analytica scandal\) have  
made it so, and due regard must be had to legal  
issues such as the General Data Protection Regula-  
tion \(GDPR\) which came into force in the European  
Union in May 2018.  
The final phase of the London Olympics ticket  
sales operated as follows\:  
• May 11th and 12th\: tickets on sale for that group  
of 20,000 people who had not been able to  
obtain tickets before due to failures of the  
ticketing system in the previous phases. There  
were tickets for all events apart from the Olym-  
pic Park tickets. Limited tickets for opening  
and closing ceremonies were included.  
• May 13th\: hockey, tennis, wrestling \(freestyle\),  
wrestling \(Greco-Roman\), beach volleyball and  
football tickets.  
• May 14th\: athletics \(race walk\), athletics \(mar-  
athon\), canoe slalom, canoe sprint, shooting,  
swimming, volleyball, weightlifting and cycling  
\(track\) tickets.  
• May 15th\: equestrian \(dressage\), eques-  
trian \(eventing\), equestrian \(jumping\), diving,  
synchronised swimming, handball, table tennis,  
swimming \(marathon\) and water polo tickets.  
• May 16th \: basketball \(North Greenwich Arena  
sessions\), badminton, sailing, gymnastics  
\(artistic\), gymnastics \(rhythmic\), gymnastics  
\(trampoline\), judo, taekwondo, boxing and  
fencing tickets.  
• May 17th\: archery, basketball \(Basketball Arena  
sessions\), cycling \(BMX\), cycling \(mountain  
bike\), cycling \(road\), modern pentathlon, row-  
ing, triathlon tickets.  
• May 17th\: Olympic Park tickets.  
Applicants for tickets were only permitted to  
buy tickets for one session and a maximum of four  
people, in order to spread the limited availability of  
tickets to as many people as possible.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Can the Olympic ticketing system be regarded  
as representative of events ticketing systems  
in general and if not, why not?  
**2** If you are managing an event where the demand  
for tickets is likely to exceed the supply \(that is  
the number of seats or places, for example\),  
what steps can you take to make the distribu-  
tion of tickets fair and equitable or is it sufficient  
to operate ticket sales on a ‘first come, first  
served’ basis.  
**3** For smaller scale and more local events, such  
as a village carnival, is online ticketing, where  
setting up the mechanism may be an expense  
or beyond your volunteers expertise, realistically  
the way to sell tickets, or are more conventional  
ways just as suitable – what are the costs, tech-  
nology and management implications of ticket  
sales and do these affect the type of approach  
or method being used?

# 235  
# Correspondence and schedules check  
To help prioritise your activities, check for any last minute changes, notes left for  
you, correspondence, phone messages or emails; check your website is up and run-  
ning. Once you’ve done this, re-read your planned schedule for the set-up and make  
any amendments or notes. Carry a notebook \(paper or tablet\) and any checklist you  
have around with you\: people have a habit of mentioning things as you go around  
that you may need to deal with. It will be a busy day, and you will forget otherwise.  
Whenever you sit down to rehydrate \(have a drink\), check your notebook. As the  
event coordinator or floor manager, you would normally expect the arrival of other  
staff, volunteers and helpers early on in the day, or, in the case of large events, pos-  
sibly before \(particularly if staging, rehearsals or complex setting-up is required\).  
A check can then be made of arrangements between coordinator and staff to deal  
with any final requests or changes to the booked details. Experienced clients can be  
expected to phone or call in, up to a week beforehand or the day before, in order  
to make general checks. This is to be encouraged, as is a ‘pre-con’ meeting between  
the venue, yourself and the other organisers to iron out any last-minute problems

# The organiser’s office  
In order to reduce stress on organisers, helpers, staff and visitors, ensure that there is a  
central point of enquiry for an event, also to act as a control location in the case of an  
emergency. An organiser’s office should be provided whenever an event is going to be  
large, long-running or VIP in nature. Where possible, offices should be in a convenient  
location \(preferably not a hotel bedroom\) and can be anything from a Portacabin to a  
desk in the Park Keeper’s potting shed \(however, also see security issues noted below  
about the location of a control point at major events\). As a minimum, everyone should  
know where it is, and it should be supplied with a landline phone and if possible  
Wi-Fi. Without it, the venue itself \(in the case of a hotel or public hall\) will become  
the clearing house for any activity relating to the event, or people will simply stop  
and ask the first person they find. Before the event, the arrival of the staging, lighting  
and PA equipment, suppliers and speakers with queries, the sponsor’s chief executive  
wanting somewhere for a ‘quiet meeting’ will have to be dealt with. Providing a room  
is not so much a matter of politeness, but of good planning. Without this, staff can be  
inundated with enquiries that they may not be able to deal with directly, or find the  
organiser in time to deal with them. If you, as an event organiser, are out and about  
around the venue, arrange for an organisational mobile phone for yourself or personal  
radio, and if the phone stops ringing, that’s because it’s broken, not because no-one  
wants you. Make sure you go back to the office at some specified times to check that  
things are going satisfactorily and to deal with anything that can’t follow you around.  
# Receiving supplies  
Various items will be delivered as preparations progress, and make sure these are  
carefully checked against the purchase orders by the designated person. One of the  
difficulties faced by events organisers is that an event is at the end of a supply chain  
which is very time-specific. To illustrate this, if you had 300 best porcelain plates deliv-  
ered to a hotel as new stock, and they were the wrong size, the wrong colour or the  
wrong design, the hotel could send them back and continue to operate using its older,  
existing plates. However, because events are unique and one-off, perhaps limited to  
a few hours of high-pitched activity, and 300 best porcelain plates are delivered that  
are the wrong size, what do you do? First, you don’t send them back, as they might  
be the only ones you can get in time, and you can’t serve 300 chicken dinners on the  
tablecloth. You accept them, writing on the delivery note that they do not comply with  
the purchase order number and you then phone the supplier to see if they can get you  
the right ones in time. Be careful to set up a controlled delivery acceptance system. It  
might have to be a volunteer helper standing next to the main gate with a list, whose  
job is to check what is coming in, sign for it and direct it to the place where it needs to  
go, but better this than having to chase around every time a surprise in a lorry turns up.  
# Transport and parking  
With some major events, particularly international ones, there may be a need to  
make suitable arrangements to transport participants to and around the event, to  
deal with baggage, and to make arrangements for materials and equipment both

in advance and afterwards. Various companies specialise in ground handling, that  
is, the movement of transport, baggage and goods. Related to this are activities  
such as venue/terminal and venue/hotel transfers. In the case of venue/terminal and  
venue/hotel transfers the nature of transport varies, depending on distance and ease  
of finding the venue. Participants and visitors may be able to walk; there may be  
public transport laid on; or taxi services may be appropriate and may be provided  
formally or informally. There are many events, in all categories, where transport  
and transfer of people are significant. At the top end of the scale would be the  
provision of chauffeur-driven executive cars to deal with VIPs and dignitaries, but  
coaches may also be hired, and typically range from 18 to 52 seats, including lux-  
ury vehicles with on-board toilets, drinks, video facilities and host/hostess guides.  
Coach hire of this kind is particularly useful for both executive travel and transfers  
of large numbers of people to remote venues. On the other hand, for many kinds  
of events, people will simply arrive on foot, use their own car or come by public  
transport. Adequate and convenient car parking arrangements will need to be made,  
including arrangements for mobility impaired visitors, for which close liaison with  
the local authority and the police, who have a role in traffic flow and control, will  
be necessary in advance. You may also need to provide volunteer or staff car park  
stewards on the day.  
# 237  
# Load-in  
The most likely item to arrive after the organiser at a major event is large scale  
equipment or large staging \(some may take several days to construct and this should  
be foreseen in the scheduling and booking of the venue\). A ground plan should be  
made by the coordinator, and a copy left with the venue to enable work to proceed if  
the organiser is not yet present or has been held up. Parking for trucks bringing this  
type of equipment or for support trucks and trailers may also be needed, especially  
at certain types of sporting events and music festivals.  
A stage set will often be followed  
by the technical equipment \(light-  
ing, sound rig, etc.\) a part of the  
set-up that is sometimes referred to  
as ‘Load-in or Bump-in’. Doing this  
properly, with stage and layout plans  
and with the area clearly marked out  
\(having been carefully measured  
for the original plans\) should help  
ensure that getting a set and its tech-  
nical equipment up and running is  
done quickly and efficiently, in time  
to be tested or used for rehearsal.  
At this point, once all the equip-  
ment is in place, cleaning can be  
done, message boards put up,

port activities, such as the layout of  
arrangements for visitors’ arrival.

# Signing the site or venue  
It is important that the event is properly signed, and signs are needed for two main  
purposes\:  
• information  
• emergencies.  
Information signs deal with aspects like normal entry and exits, the location  
of services and activities, where to queue from, and how to do particular things.  
Emergency signs deal with emergency procedures, emergency exits and escape  
routes, how to operate emergency equipment and how to call for help. The design  
of these two types of sign must be distinctly different. In general, emergency signs  
of various kinds can be obtained from specialist suppliers, from office or work-  
place suppliers or from suppliers listed on the internet. Try to use local suppliers,  
they can get to you easily. National suppliers often have a pretence of ‘good service’  
but fail in emergencies, because they are locally unresponsive. Most indoor ven-  
ues will already be properly signed for emergencies, as this is a legal requirement.  
This can be checked during the risk assessment process. For events that are in an  
unusual venue, or are outside, careful thought needs to be given to emergency  
signposting. As part of the planning stage, a ground plan of the site should have  
been drawn up, including the layout of emergency exits, access for emergency  
vehicles such as ambulances or fire engines, and plans for emergency routes. These  
can then be signposted and roped off; with stewards allocated to keep them clear  
during the event.  
The design of the information signs depends on what sort of event you have. If  
this is going to be a large-scale professional event, then you can employ a profes-  
sional sign-making company. If this is a modest volunteer event, then the design of  
the signs depends on your skill with a computer. You will not even need any fancy  
software. Keep your design simple so the signs can be seen from a distance, and if  
you draft them on A4 paper using the largest font you can fit on it, you can always  
get them enlarged and laminated at a print shop to A3 so they are easier to see from  
a distance. They do need to be all the same design and font. This is not just a matter  
of how professional your signs will look, but that visitors should be able to recognise  
information or emergency signs from the mass of background material they will  
encounter when visiting your event.  
# Security\: issues, personnel and a control point  
Only certain types of event will involve security issues. For VIP or political events  
a security check may take place at some point prior to the start of the event, usu-  
ally between set-up and public arrival \(in these cases, the set-up will have to be  
completed at least a day before the event\). Police or Interior Ministry security may  
want to physically check the venue site and may well use sniffer dogs and metal  
detectors to do so. In some cases, visitors or the audience may be required to pass  
through metal detectors of the kind found at airports, with specialist security staff  
on duty, video surveillance and security checks of staff. At this level it is also likely  
that staff may be required to hold special passes, although it is common for all staff

to be badged in some way, not only as a courtesy to delegates, guests and visitors,  
but for routine security.  
Advice on security can be sought from the local police for smaller events, and from  
security companies, some of whom specialise in security at events such as rock festi-  
vals. Security is a serious matter, no less serious than in the past and your event may  
require a full security plan \(Tarlow, 2014\), but a note of caution – do not make a big  
performance out of it. Making security into a major issue can be counter-productive  
to people’s sense of feeling secure. If security is too obvious people will wonder why  
it is there, possibly leading to them feeling more fearful, not less. Second, remember  
media reactions\: if your marketing department organises a press call, or gets a TV  
crew to your event, the media will almost naturally look for the bad news. You will  
watch the TV later to see what great pictures of your event are shown across the  
national network, to find that the TV presenter stood in front of the largest security  
guard on the entire site \(usually holding an enormous dog on a leash\), made one  
positive comment about your event and then talked on national TV for five minutes  
about the heavy security, a non-existent ‘terrorist threat’ and all manner of crimes  
you don’t have \(Bladen et al., 2018\).  
Most events do not require security of any kind – personal events and most inter-  
nal or private corporate events do not require it and only a very small number of  
major leisure and large cultural events may involve it. In many cases the venue itself  
will provide any security that is needed, for example large hotels and conference  
centres generally have their own Security Officer or Manager. Where ‘external’ or  
additional security is required, this is often a matter of the sheer size of an event – for  
example big rock festivals, big sporting events, events with large crowds, and so on,  
and the identification of whether an event needs both stewarding or security can be  
part of the risk assessment process, or by seeking advice from the local police. Whilst  
it might be thought that asking a security company for advice in the very first case is  
advisable, remember that they will want to sell you security and you may not need it –  
it will only add to your costs if it is not justified. Only if there is a genuine security or  
safety risk, should the need for security procedures or security personnel be an issue.  
Where required, security personnel should in all cases be properly accredited and  
be properly identifiable by uniform or by badges. Their primary purposes are to  
ensure responsible action in an accident or emergency; to ensure controlled access  
to limited or secure areas; to assist in the case of crowd distress or deal with minor  
disturbances. On rare occasions they may be needed to eject the unruly, but this is  
usually in conjunction with the local police. In employing a security firm, it is neces-  
sary to check they are properly licenced and that they carry the appropriate insurance  
for their role \(Swart, 2010\). Where security is required it will be necessary to discuss  
with the firm the number of its staff required in relation to whatever risk is assessed  
or perceived and in relation to the size of the venue or site; the number of entrances;  
the areas requiring access control and the number of attendees, and the public and  
any VIP or guests who may have a specific security need \(e.g. major celebrities or  
high level ministers\). Security officers or trained security stewards are likely to cover  
the following roles\:  
• the general patrolling of large venue areas or sites  
• the understanding of emergency and/or evacuation arrangements  
• the oversight of crowded areas\: reassurance of a crowd; assistance, persuasion  
and deterrence

• counting at entry points so as not to exceed the maximum load or numbers  
which the venue or site can cope with or is licenced for  
• the protection of persons, premises or equipment at the event  
• the installation, maintenance and use of security devices \(such as CCTV  
cameras\)  
• the provision of advice or training for general site stewards or hosts in security  
concerns.  
In terms of control in the case of an emergency, the senior security officer must  
have access to the designated control point or organisers’ office and be able to liaise  
directly with the senior event coordinator, the senior venue manager and senior  
health and safety officer. In locating the control point, in those cases where security  
or crowd control are an issue, it should best be located in a place where visual over-  
sight of a large area can be achieved or at the central place where CCTV is moni-  
tored. Access to the PA system or the big screens for safety, control and reassurance  
announcements should be possible from that same location, which should also be in  
proximity to any medical service area or a first aid point.  
In an emergency or crisis, where you need to deal with an urgent response, you  
should already have an emergency plan or manual. Part of this would be a sec-  
tion about media issues\: the event background, statistics, emergency procedures and  
planned responses, expertise to call in, resources available in terms of the location  
of the control point, the staff, stewards, first aid and security crews available to you;  
planned emergency messages, how the PA and screen systems are operated; checklists  
about preparing for interviews and how to gather information and who from.  
# Media handling  
Most events may have next to no media handling issues\: it might only be necessary  
to meet one or two local journalists or photographers and show them round. If,  
however, an advanced press viewing or familiarisation visit is being organised, it  
must be competently done and careful thought given to it beforehand, especially  
in terms of what the event team want out of it. Plan what you want to show and  
how it’s shown, where to take breaks on your tour round so people get a good view  
and they can hear what’s going on and ask questions. Plan the refreshments for  
yourself and your media guests, as well as a place to sit and chat informally and  
quietly about the event without being interrupted. Deal with any questions politely  
and graciously, and make sure everyone can see and hear properly; be patient and  
positive. Don’t let the media wander round aimlessly on their own. Always bear  
in mind that the media is supposedly interested in what the public wants, not  
necessarily in what you want to tell them, so you must give due consideration to  
what you may want to show them on a site visit, what the philosophy and high-  
lights of the event would be for the public, as well as being able to provide some  
statistical information, suitable photographs or photographic opportunities and  
what the background to the event is and who the key people and/or sponsor are.  
This might be done in the form of a press kit or press release which you can give  
out. In this way, you have a better chance of the information being provided in  
the way you want it rather than journalists collecting it ‘on the hoof’ and writing  
it down haphazardly.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. Rehearsal and briefings  
For a very large event with a major media presence, appropriate care should be  
taken, and proper facilities provided. This might even include a media centre, tent,  
etc., equipped with its own power and phone lines, Wi-Fi and computer worksta-  
tion\(s\); perhaps a lounge area, small interview rooms and a room large enough for  
a press conference; as well as adequate and sufficient refreshment \(keep provision  
of light refreshment moderate in order to avoid press criticism of extravagance and  
wasteful expenditure on the part of the event organisers\).  
The media’s tendency to latch on to the smallest whisper of bad news can give  
your marketing and public relations team nightmares. Reporter\: ‘Did the ceremony go  
well?’ Your press officer\: ‘Yes, we had an excellent day, with 30,000 people attending,  
although there was a bit of an argument between two blokes in the catering tent over  
a cream bun.’ Later, the local newspaper’s website has the headline\: ‘Public brawl ruins  
opening ceremony.’ In case you think this cannot really happen in real life, the headline  
from the opening ceremony of the Welsh Highland Railway in 2,000 was ‘Tractor Pro-  
test Mars Welsh Highland Re-opening.’ During the culmination of ten-year, €5 million  
effort by volunteers, a farmer left his tractor across the track and ‘the police were called’.  
This is rural Wales\: when someone leaves a tractor on your railway and you have to ring  
the police, the nearest policeman is probably 20 km away, but the impression given in  
the media was of a major incident and it distracted from the real event.  
In an unexpected crisis, you may find that you are telephoned or called on for  
an ‘immediate’ interview. In no instance must you do that there and then. Take the  
name and contact number of the journalist and find out what they most want to ask  
and call them back in ten or 20 minutes to give yourself time to compose yourself  
and check your information in response to what they want, or hand them over to  
the proper person who is responsible for public relations and the media. Remember,  
the overriding need in a crisis is to be reassuring to the public, not to spout on about  
what a disastrous day you have had since you got out of the bath that morning.  
# 241  
# Rehearsal and briefings  
A rehearsal may take place for the technical facilities, particularly of the sound and  
presentation systems for many kinds of events. Whilst a rehearsal may be a purely  
technical activity for certain types of high profile organisational events, product  
launches or public relations events, it is possible that it may be of the ‘full dress’ kind,  
including practise by actors, musicians, entertainers or other artists, including timing  
arrangements, acoustics, and so on. Ushers or stewards, if required, can be briefed  
at this point, together with any meeters/greeters the organiser may have arranged.  
Briefings \(see Figure 10.6\) for casual and specialist staff should include elementary  
issues, such as what the event is for, who is coming and the opening and closing times\:  
also details such as the location of toilets, cloakrooms, organisers’ office, refreshment  
areas, check-in areas and what to do with the VIPs \(such as direct them to a VIP  
hospitality room\), how to assist mobility-impaired visitors into the event, and what  
action is required in an emergency, including the nature of the alarm system, emer-  
gency exits, assembly points, location of the medical centre if there is one, or how to  
get a first aider quickly if there is not. All staff at the event must be given a copy of  
the site map, information sheet, emergency contact list and emergency procedures.  
The site map and information page should be one sheet of A4, the emergency contact  
list and procedures should be on another sheet of A4. Any more than this, and staff  
will not read it. Clarity is essential.

# lAyout of entrances and visitor reception  
The entrance areas or visitor reception area should be ready for use prior to the start  
time; even in the case of a small informal event. This amounts to no more than a  
table with programmes for people to pick up as they arrive. At large events, for con-  
venience of organisation, the layout of the arrival area might be alphabetical \(in the  
case of a conference\) or might have several welcome desks. It may also be necessary  
to provide greeters or an information desk, or both, as minor queries from incoming  
arrivals can slow down the entry process. Queries can be dealt with by the greeter  
moving along the queues.  
The greeters have the additional function of helping to direct visitors; whilst sig-  
nage is necessary and important, people arriving in unfamiliar locations will look first  
for someone to ask, and only secondly for \(inanimate\) directions. Toilets should also  
be located near the entrance areas\: the first request, especially if your event attracts  
the public, and particularly families, will be for the toilets.  
Where it would help, packs, site maps, entry badges and tickets \(such as refresh-  
ment tickets\) and programmes should be laid out in boxes to ensure the arrival  
process goes quickly. It is preferable that in this layout process all items \(programme,  
site map, badges, tickets and pack\) are put into large envelopes or ‘goody bags’ and  
stacked \(for those events or occasions where the visitor is going to receive a pack\).  
Not only does this increase the speed of entry, but it saves a great deal of stretch-  
ing across a vast array of material spread on a table. Any urgent messages can be  
displayed on a board at the arrival point, or even mounted on stage screens during  
refreshment breaks. It is preferable to have your most experienced staff available at  
the entrances, as first impressions count, and an impression of confusion given by  
inexperienced staff at the doors will reflect badly on the event as a whole. In planning  
the arrival areas, thought should also be given to providing power, and phone points  
for tills \(both for enquiries and if automated transactions are to take place\), and to  
the way in which the tills will be supervised, supplied with cash and change, emptied  
and the income recorded and banked.  
If the event is a conference or VIP invitation only event, a list of delegates or guests  
expected, plus badges \(for conferences\) or some suitable small gift \(for invited events,  
such as corsages or chocolates\), should have been made up prior to the event. \(Where

# Wirksworth, England Re-enactors at the Wirksworth Wapentake, Yorkshire, England  
FACTBOX  
• Wirksworth Wapentake\: Wirksworth, The Peak District of Derbyshire, England  
• A Wapentake – an ancient gathering of armed men  
• A re-enactment with volunteers and hobby enthusiasts  
• A range of site planning issues  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine some issues of site selection and set up criteria with the  
following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which the site for a particular type of event was selected.  
• To highlight what main issues might arise in the selection.  
• To understand that many issues overlap in the determination of site layouts.  
**I** n olden times, the administrative divisions of  
England were not called Boroughs or Districts;  
they were called Hundreds or Wapentakes. The  
Wapentakes were mainly in the north of England in  
those areas of the country which had been invaded  
by the Vikings from Denmark and Norway in the  
years between 875 and 900AD, that is in two of  
the component kingdoms of England\: Northumbria  
and Mercia \(the third component kingdom of  
England being Wessex, in the south\). It had long  
been remembered that the small historic town of  
Wirksworth had been the chief town of its Wapen-  
take\: The Wirksworth Wapentake in the kingdom  
of Mercia.  
The Wapentake was both an administrative dis-  
trict and an actual meeting of the local inhabitants

acting in government. This meeting, the ‘Wapen-  
take’ itself, was an annual event, where a jury was  
elected to serve for the year and votes taken on  
important issues. Those persons who owned their  
own weapon, such as a spear or sword, were enti-  
tled to vote.  
In 2008 it was decided to hold a Wapentake  
to celebrate the history and community spirit of  
the Wirksworth area, and this was probably the  
first time a Wapentake had been held for perhaps  
1,000 years. The organising committee and the re-enacting  
group had several challenges to overcome,  
including funding \(mainly via a grant and ticket sales\)  
and most significantly where to hold the main event,  
as no-one then remembered or knew where the  
original Wapentakes had been held.  
There were several site selection criteria\:  
•  The size of the site needed – in essence  
a site the size of a large cricket pitch or  
­ several football pitches was needed.  
•  There needed to be good access and  
­ parking either on-site or nearby.  
• The site needed to be largely level.  
In consequence, four possible sites were  
viewed in different locations in and around the  
town. The site selected was a former quarry, now  
filled in as a field, at the National Stone Centre near  
the town. The site was completely overgrown, but  
had been used up to five years previously for car  
boot sales.  
This site \(see sketch plan\) had some advantages  
and some disadvantages\:  
# Advantages\: Disadvantages\:  
Adequate size at  
about 16 hectares  
No mains services at all  
Relatively level and  
well drained  
Entirely overgrown  
Close to parking  
and a main road  
No on-site buildings or  
facilities  
Sheltered by  
­ surrounding woods  
The key issue regarding this site was that the  
central area was to be used for an arena for a battle  
and a boat burning ceremony. It was initially thought  
that the field was level and that it only needed the turf  
cutting, but once a local farmer had cut it, the organ-  
isers found that the underlying surface was entirely  
covered in loose stone, both hazardous to walk on  
and impossible to conduct a battle re-enactment on.  
Consequently, the field had to be cleared of stone.  
There was no money in the budget for this to be  
done mechanically so it was done by the ground  
staff of the centre, assisted by volunteers using  
rakes and wheelbarrows to pick up the stones over  
a period of six weeks. Once cleared of stones, the  
surface had to be sown with grass seed, which had  
to be allowed to grow for a further six weeks before  
being cut prior to the event. \(This timescale gives a  
hint about how long some matters take when deal-  
ing with fields!\) When finished the field was named  
‘The Great Moot Field’.  
The site had no mains services. Water was  
therefore piped through a garden hose from the  
nearest supply in a building 400 metres away to  
a stand pipe and tap. There was no sewerage or  
drainage system so portable toilet and washroom  
facilities had to be brought in. Food and drink were  
provided from mobile catering suppliers in vans  
with their own bottled gas and bottled water. The  
re-enactors camped in tents around the site and  
prepared camp fires using a wood supply, pre-ordered  
and delivered to the site before the event  
and by cutting down selected small trees with their  
battle axes \(only certain re-enactors were trained  
how to do this\). First aid facilities were provided by  
the St John’s Ambulance Service volunteers for a  
small fee, who brought a caravan to act as their  
first aid room. A control point was set up in the  
entrance marquee where tickets were also sold.  
This was a family event so there was no security,  
though the local police had been kept informed and  
attended on a casual ‘look in’ basis. In the case of  
security, many of the re-enactors were in full armour  
with huge axes\: you don’t argue with a bloke in  
full armour. In the case of fire prevention, because  
camp fires and a boat burning were a necessary  
part of the re-enactment, sand was supplied to  
extinguish fires, as well as filled water buckets, and  
fire extinguishers were provided at four locations  
around the site.

In terms of the ‘load-in’ everything had to be  
brought in, starting with the marquee two days before  
the event. At the same time, the arena had been  
demarcated by two lines of rope fencing, an internal  
one and a perimeter one, as well as hay bales outside  
this for people to sit on while watching the battle in the  
arena area. The toilets arrived the day before, when  
everything else, from the living history camp to the lit-  
ter bins arrived, including portable electric generators  
for the caterers; battery lighting to illuminate the exits  
during the boat burning \(which was held after dark\), to  
tables and chairs for the entrance marquee.  
The 2008 Wirksworth Wapentake provided an  
enjoyable historic re-enactment with a battle, a  
boat burning ceremony, a Saxon-Viking living his-  
tory encampment and displays of how a warrior was  
armed, how things were made in ancient times and  
the styles of dress the people wore. Parts of the  
event were also held in the town and in the par-  
ish church, itself of Saxon origins. The event took  
place over two days in July on what transpired to  
be the hottest weekend of the whole year – one of  
the things which had not been foreseen was the  
need for sunscreen lotion, but supplies of this were  
obtained from the town. There were no injuries of  
any kind to the battle re-enactors or to the pub-  
lic, and the event took place in an entirely safe and  
enjoyable way.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What site selection criteria might be used if  
you were looking for an outdoor wedding site  
rather than a battle re-enactment site?  
**2** When choosing a site for a unique or unusual  
event, what impact would the lack of basic ser-  
vices \(water, electricity, gas, sewage, toilets,  
washrooms, changing or store rooms\) have in  
terms of the difficulty level of putting an event  
on, and how might these matters be overcome?  
**3** Could the site set-up issues identified in this  
case be put into a time schedule or work break-

security is an issue, guests must be politely required to wear their badges, although nor-  
mally most guests are happy to do so; at informal events, or where there is no security  
issue, not everyone may wish to wear a badge and should not be compelled to if they are  
unwilling.\) But it is important that guests are checked against the guest list, as this will  
provide accurate final numbers of the people attending and can be passed on to catering  
staff for any last-minute amendments to seating or refreshment arrangements. This also  
acts as a key security check, which should not be overlooked in case of gatecrashers.  
In addition, it is also common at conference type check-ins to issue information  
packs, including agendas; working papers; delegate lists and a little information  
about the venue for delegates to take away with them. This latter should be provided  
by the venue marketing department to the client, if the organiser is making up their

own packs to ensure that a selling opportunity for the venue is not missed. For this  
kind of event, coordinators would be supported by check-in staff, normally one to  
every 50 delegates, either provided by the organisation itself or by the venue, to  
ensure delegates find the right conference and do not get mixed up with any other  
activities taking place. Normally, the coordinator would be on hand at least half an  
hour before the published start time to deal with supervising the arrival area.  
# Mobility, accessibility and inclusivity  
The modern event environment must properly take into account inclusivity and equal-  
ity. This has a number of implications for our policies and for our social and ethical  
duties to those around us. It also has some specific planning, layout and mobility out-  
comes. Most buildings now take due notice of the needs of all kinds of users, so this  
includes the provision of ramped access and lifts to enable mobility-­ impaired people  
to get around a building, in say a wheelchair or mobility scooter. Event managers also  
need to consider these issues in outdoor events where there should be obstacle-free  
routes for mobility-impaired people of a minimum 80cm width in each direction \(so  
a route of 160cm clear width in total\). Ramps and stairs should both be provided,  
as whilst it is often thought that ramps are the best solution, they are difficult for  
people with certain types of mobility issues to negotiate, and worse than this, ramps  
are often extremely long, resulting in exhaustion for those who can walk but only  
for short distances. This also means that the distance between, say, a disabled car  
parking space, an accessible toilet and an accessible viewing or participating area  
should be the shortest possible route.  
Other reasonable adjustments we may make are things like the provision of help  
points and induction loops for the hard of hearing. For those with lesser eyesight,  
clarity of presentations is important, as in very many cases people making presenta-  
tions \(for example at conferences\) fill their screens with small detail that many cannot  
see and then fail to provide follow-up materials to more fully explain their presen-  
tation. Any particular event may need to take a range of issues into account, from  
providing sign language interpreters to note takers, from providing water bowls and  
walking areas for people with Assistance Dogs to changing the seating plan or layout  
of a room or venue to accommodate ease of access. There are reports and guidelines  
available from a range of internet sources for these things and various industry  
bodies including the Business Visits and Events Partnership \(BVEP\) have undertaken  
research about the numbers of, and needs of, different kinds of participants.  
# The event experience  
Getting everything in place for an event is not only a matter of the behind-the-scenes  
efforts in terms of logistics, organisation, preparation, layout and design; it is also  
crucial to the ambience and atmosphere that will be created and experienced by the  
participants, visitors or guests. Events may be simple or complicated; in the modern  
world it is more difficult to impress an audience with an event because the public is  
much more used to seeing events in the media and to attending events. This means  
that the efforts that may have to be put into creating a pleasant experience at an event,  
in circumstances that might make its staging quite difficult, may have to be quite  
considerable.

# 247  
This design part of the process may have to take into account the venue, its layout,  
its environment, decor, lighting, music, colour scheme and a whole range of other  
incidental factors. Nevertheless, we must also bear in mind that at a vast majority  
of events it is the guests or visitors themselves who will help create the atmosphere  
and ambience of the event, simply by their presence or by their participation and  
involvement, as well as their enjoyment, or otherwise, of it.  
Ambience is often significant to the creation of a good event. An event with the  
right ambience can be a huge success. An event with the wrong ambience can be a  
huge failure. At a personal event, such as a birthday party, the ambience may be cre-  
ated simply by the people who are there, without the need for anything else – good  
company amongst friends can make an excellent event.  
Some events, however, may need a little help to go well. As at a birthday party, there  
might be the need for decorations, music and games, as well as food and drink. But  
it is important to understand that the presence of these elements does not in any way  
guarantee that things will go well. There can be a wonderful environment, expensive  
themed decor, large amounts of excellent food and drink, yet the event might still  
not be quite the success that the organisers intended. However, one of the roles of an  
events coordinator is to try and ensure the event succeeds by careful attention to detail  
and by trying to make sure that the experience which guests receive is a good one.  
In simple terms we can regard the staging and ambience of an event as comprising  
a number of interlinked features \(see Figure 10.7\). The physical setting of an event,  
which deals with various design and staging activities, is primarily intended to look  
after the event’s surroundings and the visitor’s responses to them. Visitors respond to  
stimulus of their senses of smell, sight, touch, hearing and taste. The physical responses

# CASE STUDY  
# 32  
# The atmosphere of events\: Glastonbury Festival  
# Robert Smith/Alamy Stock Photo  
***Glastonbury, England Radiohead perform at Glastonbury Festival, 2017***  
FACTBOX  
• Glastonbury Festival, England  
• 134,000 ‘weekend tickets’ for the three-day event; capacity is set at 150,000  
• Employs some 1,700 people during the event \(excluding volunteers and pre-  
event contractors\)  
• 37,500 passes for performers, stewards, traders, crew, etc.  
• Admission price in 2017 was €270  
• Famous for its informality  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to consider some issues relating to the atmosphere at events  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which the environment and festival attendees at Glastonbury contribute  
to the atmosphere.  
• To examine whether the event ‘experience’ is simply determined by physical factors or by the  
inherent success of the core activity and the interaction of participants.  
**I** n a number of large fields on Worthy Farm in  
Somerset, nestling in the rolling green English  
countryside, over 100,000 people gather to listen  
to bands playing anything from hip hop to jazz. This  
is Glastonbury, put on almost every year at the sum-  
mer solstice by Michael Eavis, a large number of  
volunteers and some paid staff. Not quite every year,  
because sometimes the land needs to be given a

rest, for example there was no Glastonbury in 2018.  
This is a farm and it has real cows. In fact, at the first  
festival, the admission price included free milk for the  
1,500 people who attended it then, in 1971.  
Glastonbury has, over the 40 or so years of its  
existence, become internationally famous. It has  
played host to hundreds of bands and individuals. It  
is ‘peculiarly British’ in the type of people it attracts,  
a cross-section of the music-loving public, and is  
relaxed in a hippy, New Age kind of way. It is well  
known for the nature of its portable toilets and, in  
rainy summers \(this is England\), its sea of mud.  
Although there are headline bands each year, the  
programme is not especially fixed but might con-  
tain over 50 bands or acts over the three days who  
play on several stages throughout the farm area.  
There is a tendency for much of what goes on to be  
impromptu, and because of its rural situation it plays  
all night \(to the annoyance of a few local residents\).  
The general theme has tended to be dance  
music, which makes for an enjoyable environment.  
The social inclusiveness of the festival also means  
that considerable charitable funds are raised for  
Greenpeace, Oxfam, Campaign for Nuclear Disar-  
mament and other local and national charities.  
The audience is catered for by facilities such as  
the festival markets, which include over 700 stalls  
in five or so main market areas, laid out in pre-sold  
pitches \(in effect, a way of licensing stalls\). These  
markets are grouped together around key services  
such as water, electricity and toilets. Camping, in the  
open, in tents, vans, motor caravans, caravans and  
big motor homes is a feature of Glastonbury and  
the campsite fields have various facilities including  
cafés. In the evenings, the warm glow of campfires  
in the summer dusk contributes to much of the  
festival’s atmosphere, also created by its location in  
a beautiful valley extending towards the Tor \(rocky  
hill\) at Glastonbury itself. The music also impacts  
on the festival atmosphere, depending on which  
bands, players and sets are performing and when.  
The mood can be raucous or peaceful. The festival  
has also had a number of impacts. Its informality  
\(as well as sound\) did not go down well with some  
locals, to the extent that in 1981 the local Conserva-  
tive \(‘right wing’\) Member of Parliament tried to stop  
the festival by creating a law \(via the British Parlia-  
ment\) requiring all festivals in Britain to be licenced  
by a local authority \(council\). The intention was to  
stop the Glastonbury Festival but the local Mendip  
Council approved the licence. The festival attracts a  
large number of visitors and participants and injects  
a significant amount of money into the area and into  
local businesses associated with it; these are also  
significant local considerations.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** In what way does the setting of Glastonbury  
have an impact on the atmosphere and style  
of the festival?  
**2** Identify the major features of the surroundings  
and of the communal lifestyle that predominates  
at Glastonbury. Is the atmosphere due solely to  
the type of music or are a range of other factors  
in place?  
**3** Can these factors be successfully transferred  
to other festivals?  
**4** Which features make the Glastonbury Festival  
unusual in organisational terms?

to a pleasant meal environment are well understood, and much the same applies to an  
event environment and to the experience a visitor receives while attending.  
An event environment can probably be quite complicated in certain situations.  
Suppose we are organising a medieval-themed night. In order for the night to be  
successful, its planning and execution will have to appeal to all the senses and you  
will need to provide a themed environment that would be convincing or satisfying to  
the guests. This might require the careful selection of a venue, as it would be easier  
to adapt a suitable building than to create a total medieval experience in a marquee  
\(although this could be done, with enough time and resources\). After this, all the  
elements of the theme could be prepared, from the decor to the costumes, and care  
would have to be taken that this is done well in order for the best possible experience  
to be received. For example, how should the event smell? For a medieval theme, the  
answer to this question may be based on how a wood fire smells, so there might have  
to be one, and bearing in mind different kinds of wood smell of different things. The  
answer is less likely to be based on what a medieval cow smells like – we are not,  
after all, attempting to recreate the medieval world at a theme night – only to give  
a feel for it, but this recreation might be the case at a historical re-enactment, where  
something approaching accuracy may be an issue for the re-enactors.  
The physical elements of surroundings, props, layout, equipment, personal arte-  
facts, etc., go towards making up the whole environment. This environment, together  
with the cognitive, emotional and physiological responses of the guests \(as well as  
of the staff, crew, artists and entertainers\) help make up what people feel about the  
event and will also help determine how the guests interact, how they respond to staff  
and whether they stay and enjoy themselves.  
In addition to the setting of the event and its surroundings, there are various  
service factors as perceived by the guests. Many events are run by amateurs and  
volunteers, and this may \(or may not\) be a key part of the experience. If the client  
is paying a professional to put on a medieval theme evening, he/she is likely to have  
certain expectations of the event and its service standards. If, on the other hand, the  
event is a co-operative one, put on by volunteers in their spare time and by their own  
efforts, the expectations of the event and its service standards may be quite different.  
Service at events might be thought of more in terms of procedural and conviviality  
characteristics, as shown in Figure 10.8.  
We can see from this that it cannot be assumed that every event will go well, and  
some events are disastrous, shambolic, disorganised, cold, wet and unpleasant. There  
may be many reasons for such unhappy outcomes, ranging from sheer incompetence  
on the part of the organisers, to lack of resources, money, time or training. Anything  
and everything can conspire against some of the best laid plans, from the weather to  
blocked drains. The art of being a good events coordinator is to mitigate these prob-  
lems where they occur, so that the overall experience of the participants is positive.  
We can be forgiven if it rains. We will not be forgiven if the queue for the toilets is  
30 minutes or it takes two hours just to get out of the car park.

# Summary  
**W** e have attempted to provide an overview of some of the  
more serious issues regarding the project management of  
events so that, particularly in the case of large or complicated events,  
these techniques can be used to formalise the approach of the event  
coordinator to the requirements of the occasion.  
We have also sought to provide an overview of the set-up and  
preparation activities that take place immediately prior to, and during the  
start of an event, noting that efficient preparation and due thought will  
reduce the risk of something going wrong or some important matter being  
overlooked.  
The set-up process should not be seen as separate from the activities  
of running the event on the day, as this is often a continuous process, and  
the reader should also look at ‘Running the event on the day’, for more  
information.

# 255  
# Introduction  
The organisation and staffing of special events vary considerably. Personal events,  
for example, often involve friends, family and volunteers. Organisational events may  
employ events management companies or professional events organisers. Both paid  
and volunteer helpers are common at a large number of events, notably those involv-  
ing community activities, sports, and so on. Professional organisation is common but  
expensive for some kinds of event. As a typical example, weddings could be under-  
taken entirely by volunteer help, or entirely by professional help, or by a mixture  
of both – it may simply depend on the budget. The event organiser must be aware,  
though, that this is not the only criterion\: the issue is partly one of knowing what  
volunteer help can accomplish, or when to bring in professionals for reasons of size,  
safety, standards or other reasons.  
As with many other labour intensive service industries, the events business has a  
considerable need for staff. This is satisfied by on-the-job training and by the recruit-  
ment of staff from outside, whether direct from the labour pool or by recruiting from  
colleges and universities. Unlike other service industries, however, there are a limited  
number of events-specific courses in the current academic world, which means that  
the events business has to rely on adapting its staff from other sources, such as the  
hospitality or tourism industries, and from courses in these fields, as well as from  
marketing, business and leisure programmes.  
For all the considerable effort that goes into preparing an event, running it on the  
day can still prove a challenge. The coordination of a wide range of disparate and even  
unusual activities, facilities and services can be overwhelming. Events management has  
to be effective and events managers must be effective in situations that may be constantly  
changing. The importance of good planning and preparation is that it reduces the vari-  
ability and uncertainty of what is taking place during the event and allows the event  
coordinator to concentrate on those matters that require immediate or frequent attention.  
# Organisation  
One of the themes that has emerged in the preceding chapters is the diversity of  
events. The organisational issues mirror this diversity. It is extremely unlikely that  
any two events would have exactly the same organisational structure or staffing. This  
said, there are some similarities, and we would expect core services to be organised  
in broadly similar ways. There is a probability that event organisational structures  
would include five main functions\:  
• visitor services operations  
• support services operations  
• marketing  
• administration, and  
• finance.  
These five functions can be further sub-divided depending on the nature and size  
of the event, but a survey of the organisation charts of a number of events would  
probably show that all five functions are likely to be present in some form.  
The organisational structure for an event forms the framework around which  
the various activities and services operate. It has been previously noted that

events provide a mix of products and services, for example\: ceremony and celebra-  
tion; food and drink services; presentation and technical services; support and  
­ ancillary services. These activities will probably come under an operations depart-  
ment, which might itself be sub-divided into visitor services and support operations  
\(as in Figure 11.1, the former for parts of the event that have public contact, the latter for  
those that do not\). In addition to the operations department which will be specific to any  
given public event, the organisational structure will typically have a marketing depart-  
ment whose role may be to cover sales activities, and perhaps enquiries and ticketing,  
depending on the type of operation. There is also likely to be an accounts and control  
function, to deal both with outgoing and incoming invoices and financial business, and  
which may also include a purchasing role, particularly in larger events. Underpinning the  
support activities will be an administration department, covering not only general admin-  
istration but also personnel issues, recruitment and induction, payment of wages, etc.

In this kind of organisational structure, the key members of staff, or key managers,  
might be the only paid staff at the event, and the actual staff doing the work might  
otherwise be volunteers. Similarly, if the event is being run by a club or society, the  
key staff might simply be the members of that organisation’s normal committee.  
Committees are extremely common in events. In consequence, in many events organ-  
isations it is common to find a core body of officers, managers or coordinators that  
have the job of organising the activities and of supervising either volunteers or paid  
casual and part-time staff. This body is the skeleton and framework of the organisa-  
tion and is sometimes called a cadre.  
The organisational structure for an event may simply consist of the cadre and  
their helpers. At a small village flower show, the total number of people organising  
and helping to organise and run the event might be fewer than 20, with only six of  
them being the cadre, or key organisers, perhaps because they form the village hor-  
ticultural club’s regular committee. On the other hand, the organisational structure  
of an event may become enormously complex, with a mixture of key organisers, vol-  
unteer helpers, paid full-time, part-time and casual staff, and the organisation might

also include some outsourced activities such as catering or concessions, resulting in  
something that is well suited to the event taking place, but which would be regarded  
as extremely odd if it were a conventional organisation.  
The organisational structure \(example in Figure 11.2\) may appear very conven-  
tional. This is because there is a need, in an organisation where unfamiliar people  
are working together, to know exactly who is in charge. There must be no ambiguity  
over the safety of the public and the efficiency of the organisation \(which, having been  
created to run an event may be a relatively short-lived entity\). The lines of communi-  
cation in events organisations, not only pass up and down the hierarchy but also run  
from side to side. This is essential to ensure that information gets passed around the  
organisation quickly and does not get bogged down by having to be transferred up  
to line managers and back down again. For example, if there is a change in the music  
programme, the Music Officer needs to tell the Visitor Services Officer, but also needs  
to be able to speak directly to the information and ticket office without waiting for  
other managers or officers to turn up, these being staff who might be part-time or only  
at the venue at certain times. The one person who is slightly detached in this example  
system is the Catering Officer, whose own organisation tends to be self-contained.

In this type of organisation, we can also see a mix between paid and volunteer  
staff, and that staff might originate from a number of sources. Suppose a festival is  
being organised by a city tourist department, rather than by a voluntary committee;  
in this case the cadre may be provided by members of that tourist department \(see  
Case Study 34\: organisation at the Deventer Book Market\). Other members of staff  
might come from other organisations involved in the festival, including performers,  
contractors, sponsors or volunteers.  
# Organisational effectiveness  
The culture of an organisation is thought to impact on an organisation’s efficiency  
and ability to do its job. Perhaps it can be said that events are about creating wealth\:  
wealth of experiences; wealth in socialisation; wealth in community spirit. ‘Profit’  
alone is too limited a concept. In our analysis of events so far, we have repeatedly

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. **258 Chapter 11** The organisation manager and the team\: during the event  
made the point that it is the purpose of only certain types of events to make a profit.  
For the family and friends organising a wedding the objective is not to make a  
profit, but to celebrate the wedding; for the athletics club running its annual sport-  
ing competition, the primary objective is not to make a profit, but to showcase the  
best performers in the sport, to encourage supporters and athletes and to test these  
athletes in competition. If a little money is taken on the gate, well and good, but this  
is secondary to the sport. Therefore, in considering organisational effectiveness at  
an event we must take into account the kind of organisation culture which is pres-  
ent, and this may be cooperative and social rather than focused on commercial or  
bureaucratic aims \(Tum et al., 2006\) \(see Figure 11.3\).

The issue for event managers, then, is about how to organise an effective event,  
possibly with a disparate range of people, whose reasons for being there may be  
social rather than commercial, and who will work towards an objective over a rel-  
atively short period of time without too much concern about the style of the organ-  
isation they are working with. Additionally, although an event may be undertaken  
by a professional organisation, the nature of many events is still largely informal  
and social. Events are significant social activities; they are often communal and good  
natured, and this is reflected in their culture.  
The typology of events in Chapter 1 noted the difference in the scale of organi-  
sational complexity and levels of uncertainty. In organisational development terms,  
the simpler an event, the fewer contributing organisations and individuals. Conse-  
quently, the development of the organisation’s culture may be faster, and may also  
impact more quickly on its effectiveness. It is rather easy to assume that because an  
events organisation might be made up of happy volunteers who want to contribute  
their skills and enthusiasm, the event will be a runaway success. Although volun-  
teers can be the backbone of an organisation, they may also have their limitations\:

Monday Carnival Procession and three days of costume balls  
• Admission ticket, with grandstand seats, a costume ball and a carnival show\: €70  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine a cultural event and how voluntary effort is important to its  
organisation and operation with the following objectives\:  
• To consider what role volunteer support has at the Mainz Carnival.  
• To highlight how different types of stakeholders interact to support the carnival.  
**V** olunteer support coordinated by a central  
carnival office is a key feature of the three-  
day Mainz Carnival. Local people are intensively  
involved in the carnival preparations, which take  
many months and include special preparations by  
a large number of carnival clubs, made up of vol-  
unteer members who wish to contribute in some  
way to the success of the event. The carnival has a  
long history associated with the traditional German  
festival of ‘Fastnacht’, which takes place on Shrove  
Tuesday. In the Mainz Carnival, there are three days  
of celebrations from Saturday to the Monday before  
Lent \(called Rose Monday\).  
The Mainz Carnival is organised by a carnival  
office \(secretariat\), the Mainzer Carneval Verein,  
formed in 1838. It coordinates the efforts of official

bodies, professional organisations and the many  
volunteer carnival clubs. The carnival office has a  
small permanent staff, which is increased for the  
carnival itself by the addition of volunteers and  
additional casual staff who have many years’ expe-  
rience of running the event. Oversight of the carnival  
is through a committee of almost 50 members with  
the City Mayor being an observer. Carnival organisa-  
tion officially begins in the previous October, to allow  
enough time for the complex work of providing the  
intensive three-day celebration in March. In prac-  
tice, however, preparations and planning are more  
or less continuous throughout the year for such a  
large-scale activity.  
The carnival organisation is a combination of  
effort by public, voluntary and private sector bodies.  
Local government involvement helps provide tourist  
promotion and logistics support, whereas the pri-  
vate sector provides local business help with fund-  
ing, sponsorship, displays and other support for  
the voluntary organisations involved. The voluntary  
element draws from the carnival clubs together with  
many other local clubs, societies and recreational  
organisations, and makes up a very significant part  
of the carnival effort. The clubs range from sporting  
to theatrical clubs, from music clubs to historical  
re-enactment societies and provide marchers in the  
procession, floats, displays and tableaux, ensuring  
that the carnival is loud and colourful. A very wide  
range of activities takes place in addition to the  
major carnival processions. These include carnival  
shows with stands and displays, as well as cos-  
tumed and masked balls where participants, guests  
and visitors dress up, are wined and dined, dance  
and enjoy other social activities.  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** What role do the various voluntary organisa-  
tions play in making the carnival a success?  
**2** What is the function of the carnival secretariat?  
**3** How does the existence of carnival clubs  
improve the standard of the carnival and the  
range of activities being put on?  
**4** Compare this organisation with your own  
local carnival or annual festival\: how do they  
differ?

Organisational effectiveness  
an initial rush of enthusiasm may fade  
away, or they may have volunteered  
for reasons completely unrelated  
to the needs of the event \(hence the  
requirement for a selection procedure,  
even for volunteers\), or they may also  
be diverted from their task by other  
enthusiasms. For this reason, careful  
thought is needed about how to make  
the best use of volunteers, but also how  
to reward those whose efforts are gen-  
uine and will add considerably to the  
event \(Schlenker et al., 2015\).  
Volunteers are people who choose  
to contribute their time, skills, effort  
Get a little help from your friends\: volunteer labour is used at many events  
and experience, without pay, to benefit  
a cause or the community in which they live. As such, their motives for volunteering  
are personal and possibly social, as by volunteering they may be involved in hobbies  
they enjoy, or be undertaking a role that enables them to meet new people, or to  
spend time with friends, or that might provide satisfaction or self-esteem. It might  
also enable them to exercise their skills, or to remain active if they are retired. These  
motives must be taken into account when volunteer labour is being used. In creating  
an effective volunteer organisation or team, it will naturally help to know what their  
reasons are for being there, and what they hope to get out of it \(Matthews, 2016\).  
We also have to bear in mind that volunteers are exactly that, they may turn up and  
be the backbone of your event, but it is important to consider that not all may do  
so. You may lose some of your expected numbers of volunteers on the day and this  
may mean you have to plan to ensure your key areas or services are staffed with  
those you do have. Experience would certainly show that for outdoor events, rain  
or other bad weather early in the morning of the event will have a negative effect  
on the number of volunteers who turn up.  
Teams created and developed in short-life organisations, where situations may be  
unusual or new to them, can vary in their effectiveness. The classic approach to team  
building is to go through a number of processes before teams become effective, for  
example, the ‘forming, norming, storming and performing’ scenario, bearing in mind  
that not all teams reach the performing stage. However, this approach pre-supposes  
that there is sufficient time to organise teams and for them to socialise through the  
process. In the case of special events, this method and approach to team-building  
may not be appropriate or suitable. There may simply not be sufficient time to team-  
build, in which case a participative style of management will be needed by the team  
leader. Additionally, since many events are reliant on volunteer staff, the timescale  
for organising them and socialising them into the culture of the event organisation  
may be very short indeed. In this case, the effectiveness of the organisation may not  
rely on group development at all, but on a wide range of factors, some of which  
may ultimately be beyond the control of the organising group \(see Figure 11.4\). It  
is also important to have an understanding of those matters which are important to  
the success of an event, the **‘**  
**­ Critical ­ Success ­ Factors’** \(Wanklin, 2010\). These factors  
vary from event to event, but might include the nature of the core activity, \(‘a good  
performance’\) as well as a range of subsidiary issues from ease of access, to cleanli-

The event we have worked so hard to organise may not be a success. It may be a  
failure for any number of reasons, internal or external. Success is sometimes elusive,  
for all our market research, for all the effort put in to producing something that  
we hope will be excellent. In the end, the public might not actually buy tickets, and  
the reasons for this might be beyond the control of the event organisers. However,  
let us assume that everything is going very well. We have a packed programme,  
enthusiastic and knowledgeable volunteers, advance sales of tickets have taken off  
and what we need to do is keep up the momentum. With volunteer staff, our effec-  
tiveness depends on good leadership, clear objectives, thorough communication and  
adequate support for the volunteers from the event organisation. They should be  
given proper encouragement and praise for their efforts, be carefully listened to for  
their ideas and comments \(and these should be acted on where they are appropriate\),  
be given flexibility in how they can perform a task, if they require it, they should  
be in relatively small teams so that they can socialise and enjoy themselves, and be  
given suitable rewards. The emphasis with volunteer staff lies in the fact that they  
have volunteered because they are committed and interested, but they are unpaid.  
This lack of pay should be offset by careful thought about the support and rewards  
they get for doing the task. Support may range from providing proper meals for  
volunteers and their own dedicated facilities, to giving proper induction and basic  
training. Rewards could be anything from special uniforms, badges, custom-made  
sweatshirts or small gifts when they leave, to holding social events and parties, or giv-  
ing celebrations and prizes for the volunteers at significant points during the event,  
rather than just a farewell party at the end, in order to recognise their efforts. It is  
also important that volunteers are mentioned in the internal and external marketing

of the event, in newsletters and press releases, and that, following the close-down of  
the event, careful efforts are made to thank volunteers. It may also be necessary to  
provide some financial support in the form of payment for travel or other subsistence  
expenses, or the provision of travel passes when an event is so large that it has its  
own transport arrangements.  
# 263  
# Staffing\: professional or volunteer  
# management?  
If you were the client for an event, perhaps a company wanting a product launch,  
or a celebrity wishing to hold a charity benefit, then there is a reasonable degree of  
certainty that you would wish to employ a professional organisation to provide it.  
The events industry has not only management companies, but also production com-  
panies, as well as individual professional organisers and consultants, who can put  
your event on. You simply employ one of these, set up a project brief and pay them  
a given fee to get on with it. In fact, some companies employ or retain an events  
management operator, perhaps on a contractual basis. In this type of relationship,  
events operators may be invited to tender for the business, based on a brief of what  
is required, in much the same way that marketing agencies can tender for promo-  
tional programmes for client companies. Event Management Companies \(EMCs\) and  
organisers found on the internet, may be stand-alone operations or ones that have  
developed out of a related service provider, such as a caterer \(some being divisions  
of catering companies\). Others have grown out of production companies or are part  
of hotel or venue booking agencies. EMCs tend to be involved where the organisers  
have a requirement for major or high profile events, specialist dinners, celebrity par-  
ties, high profile charity fund raising events, or where an event demands specialist  
design, innovation, or a major media impact.  
Looking at an event, the organising body, client or buyer may simply say\: ‘Our  
event requires a good professional organisation. Let’s get some quotations in and  
watch some presentations, then we will choose an organiser and pay them to get on  
with it’ \(see Figure 11.5\). However, the diversity of the events field is such that this  
is only one way of doing it. The alternative is that the organisers, clients or buyers  
do it themselves. This is extremely common and takes two forms. First, where the  
organising body employs a full-time person or even has a department to undertake  
events organisation. This is especially the case for trade activities, such as conference  
organisation and fund raising efforts amongst companies, associations and charities.  
It is also the type of structure found in public sector organisations such as town and  
city council tourism, leisure or economic development departments. These depart-  
ments often have the task of providing events to support council aims, such as to  
increase tourism, community inclusion, economic expansion, etc. Second, where the  
activity is directly run, but not part of a separate department within the client’s  
organisation, it might be that whoever wants an event in an organisation just gets  
on and does it themselves or with a group; this is often the case for conferences, staff  
parties, birthdays, and so on.  
Probably by far the most common type of events organisation is none of these, but  
is the committee of volunteers. The committee might be in the position where it runs  
special events as part of its role. Alternatively, a special committee may be set up just  
to deal with a given event \(we could even interpret the organisation of a wedding

Based on various job adverts  
by the respective families as a type of volunteer committee\). But what if you have to  
start completely from scratch? You have a brief to organise an event, on your own.  
Most people, at this point will pick up the phone and message their friends to ask  
who could lend a hand. Instinctively, you probably do two things\:  
• Think about who you know has the ability to help.  
• Think about who you know might like to help.  
In setting up something slightly more formal than a few friends putting together  
a dinner party, much the same approach can be considered, if in a rather more for-  
malised way. You need to know some basic details about the event you are planning,  
but essentially you need to consider what talents or skills are needed and who might  
have them. Some people are good organisers, some are good communicators, some  
are good with their hands, some with figures, computers, or gathering resources or  
equipment. But it’s not as simple as this. You will be putting together a team of vol-  
unteers, which means you will not necessarily get exactly the skills and talents you  
think you need, and you will most likely have a disparate group of people who want  
to be involved and who are enthusiastic, but who might have to undertake tasks they  
have never done before \(although this can be one of the pleasures of volunteering\).  
In short, you may simply have to assign by intuition the most suitable people to the  
various tasks you have identified.  
On the other hand, you might look around your team and think, ‘Now what?’  
First, this is a special event and you have a tight timescale; it might have to be  
enough that you have some helpers; and you will probably be thankful for them  
having just turned up. Also, for short-life organisations there is little time for group  
development, so you may wish to get this group of individuals to choose their own  
roles, thus ensuring that they are doing something they like or know a little about  
and will put their best efforts into. But a couple of things should be borne in mind\:  
an individual is just that\: one person’s best effort will be completely different from

the next person’s best effort, and given their individual abilities and experience, you  
may get completely different results from two people doing the same job. Bearing  
in mind the limitations or scope of skills and talents that people have, in addition  
to letting helpers identify the jobs they would most like, you can divide up ancillary  
tasks amongst them to cover those things for which there might be no direct exper-  
tise in the group. In this way you should be able to deal with gaps in your group’s  
knowledge and talents and so cover your original list of what needs to be done. After  
all, lots of people will probably be able to say, ‘I can help out in the catering tent. . . ’  
but you may not get anyone who says, ‘I’m an expert at health and safety.’  
A voluntary committee \(or any committee\) can vary considerably in its number  
of members and what they do, what their titles are, and so on, but it will probably  
form the basic organisation structure for many types of events \(see Figure 11.6\). It  
is important that the leader of a committee is the best person who can be found for  
the job. The best person will have enough time to undertake the role, should have  
previous experience of committee work and some knowledge of organising events.  
The implication of this is that whoever sets up the committee to run an event, might  
not be the one who becomes the chair of it.

# fActors influencing the number and type  
# of staff  
With the framework of the event organisation up and running, the next stage is for  
the respective officers or heads of department to identify what type of and how many  
staff they need. This process is often based on experience, either of previous events  
or of members of the committee. Alternatively, a list of tasks can be drawn up \(or the  
work break-down structure used\) and the number of staff estimated. This will result  
in the basic outline of a staff plan, which can then be developed and costed into a  
staffing budget. Various factors will affect the number of staff each department needs  
to run the event \(see Figure 11.7\).

# The size of the event  
This is a simple enough place to start. How big is this event going to be? Can you put  
it on with a few friends and relatives, or will it need thousands? \(The 2018 Winter  
Olympic Games at Pyeonchang required 51,130 staff and 14,647 volunteers.\) Do you  
know what the likely demand will be? \(How many people will come?\) Have you done  
any market research? Is your event limited by the capacity of your venue? If the site  
capacity is 300 people, or has licencing only for 300, then that is the maximum number  
of people you need to staff for. \(See also logistics, especially for catering staff numbers.\)  
# The balance between staffing types  
There are variations between what your staff can achieve, given their expertise,  
ability, knowledge and experience. Full-time paid staff may have all these things  
in abundance, and one full-time staff member may be able to achieve what would  
normally take two volunteers to do. \(But this does not allow for enthusiasm\: a volun-  
teer is working at your event because he or she wants to be there and they may well  
work harder than a full-time member of staff who doesn’t want to be there! This is a  
variable.\) Perhaps you may have a choice about how the event will be staffed. Within  
the limits of your budget, you might decide you can afford three full-time staff to  
cover a particular task, say the Information Office. But that might mean – allowing  
for days off – that you might only be able to cover the Information Office with one  
person on a shift most of the time\: if, for example, it is open 9 am to 9 pm and you  
know it will get busy in the afternoons, you have a range of choices\:  
•  You can run it with the full-time staff, knowing that the one on duty in the  
afternoon will be swamped.  
•  You could use one member of full-time staff as supervisor and trainer, have  
six volunteers to cover the Information Office and use the money you save  
for another task.  
•  You could have three full-time equivalents \(this may mean six half-time  
staff\), which might give you more flexibility to cover the tasks.  
•  You might not be able to get any full-time staff and you might finish up using  
a range of part-time, agency, casual or volunteer staff in various roles, to get  
the job done.

These alternatives depend largely on the circumstances you find yourself in. Full-  
time staff are not very common at the operational level of events, because running  
one event over a couple of days can hardly be described as full-time. Full-time staff  
are found mostly in festival cadres, or in those companies, such as contract or out-  
door caterers, which have large numbers of events to put on, and staff, especially  
at a management or coordinator level, travel from one to another setting them up,  
running them and closing them down, then going on to the next one. In some com-  
panies, casual staff are taken on for a season, and can then be moved from event to  
event within a given geographical area. This saves time and money on training, and  
requires less overall effort on local recruitment. Casual staff are also often obtained  
via local agencies or through contacts at venues.  
# 267  
# The location of activities and concentration of staff  
# at key points  
The location of the activities at an event can have a number of impacts on staffing  
as the wider the area that has to be covered, the more the staff that may be needed,  
and the more difficult communication with them may become. Ideally, for their  
own safety and peace of mind, staff should not be alone in locations isolated from  
the main centre of activity without the means to communicate with it. The range of  
activities at an event is a major factor in staffing. In general, the more going on and  
the broader the range of services, facilities or components of an event, the larger the  
number of staff needed. In terms of physical layout, some events can be designed  
with ease of staffing in mind. It might be possible to concentrate all the services  
and activities on one central location, where the various staff, being multi-skilled,  
can do whatever needs doing. These ‘service cores’ tend to be centralised, so that  
fewer staff can operate and supervise a larger number of activities. Concentration  
of design also reduces transit times for staff moving from one part of the venue  
to another and has the benefit of concentrating utility and store provision in one  
­ location \(see Figure 11.8\).

# The method of provision  
This is chiefly an issue of the provision of services such as catering or retail, where  
there are opportunities to provide the service ‘in-house’ \(i.e. with your own staff  
or volunteers\), as against contracting the activity to a specialist company. There  
are advantages and disadvantages of doing either, but in staffing terms, getting  
in a contractor will have the effect of relieving the organisers of having to bother  
about covering that particular task with their own staff \(van der Wagen and White,  
2015\). Related to this is the issue of quality. The contractor may have highly trained  
and expert staff and be able to provide something better than you could, within  
your limited resources. On the other hand, contracting sometimes leads to a loss of  
­ control, problems in the maintenance of quality and will cost you more, sometimes  
a lot more.  
# The demand for, and scheduling of, staff  
Demand is a baseline determinant of staffing. At any event, there will be a fixed level  
of staff below which it is not possible to fall \(for example, one administrator may be  
required to be on duty at any time between 8.30 am and 4.30 pm five days a week  
to deal with even a low level of business – visitors, general paperwork, enquiries,  
email, etc.\). The one administrator may be able to deal with greater demand only up  
to a certain level. Quite simply, as demand increases so too will staffing. The issue  
is often about how to schedule the staff to deal with peaks and dips in demand. For  
this, it will be essential to be aware of when the event is going to be busy and when it  
is not, and at those peak demand periods, which parts of the event will be most busy  
and need most staffing. Suppose the peak arrival time at our village fête is between  
10 and 11 am, clearly we would need extra staff at the entrance selling tickets. The  
peak period in the catering tent might be between 1 and 2 pm, so that spare staff  
could be transferred from the entrance to the catering tent. The peak period in the  
arena might be between 3 and 4 pm, with visitors buying items at stalls and playing  
games, so spare staff could then be transferred there. This is a simple example, but  
illustrates the point that we need to give some thought to what parts of an event are  
busy and when and how we can deploy our staff to cope. This deployment is some-  
times called ‘Resource Smoothing’.  
The control of the cost of staffing is also a major concern. Rosters are produced  
by management to schedule staff, yet cost control is as much dependent on effec-  
tive forecasts of demand and careful rostering as it is on the sheer number of staff.  
A  
­ comparison of two managers compiling a roster for the same event, the same  
demand forecast and the same staff could still produce a significant variance in cost  
due to the ability of each to complete an appropriate roster effectively.  
Paid staff might not be required. Even a relatively large-scale event can be accom-  
plished by capable volunteers, provided it is both relatively simple in format and  
requires no major technical expertise. If we consider a play as an example, almost  
all the aspects of putting on a play, from preparing the stage sets to designing the  
costumes, could be done by experienced volunteers, but elements such as lighting or  
electrical systems would need expert volunteers. The concept of an expert volunteer  
might seem a little odd, but is perfectly common – the person volunteering to deal  
with the lighting of the play might be a lighting engineer in real life, or a retired one,  
or do it as a committed hobby.

# 269  
# The expertise required  
This brings us to probably the most important issue for an events organiser – what  
kind of expertise is available for the planned event? The various tasks identified ear-  
lier should be developed into a series of job descriptions to help the matching process  
\(an example job description form is given in Figure 11.9\). The labour pool must be  
considered carefully at this stage\: what staff are available, what are they capable of,  
what is their expertise, what things might need to be done for which either training

is needed, or professional help would have to be paid for? Even seemingly simple  
choices can have serious staffing complications, both in terms of staffing numbers  
and knowledge. This is often highlighted by catering issues, where an organiser might  
choose a dish that he/she particularly likes, only to find it not only completely unsuit-  
able for, say, a wedding reception in a marquee, but also almost unproducible for the  
numbers involved. Organisers have been known, for example, to put crêpe suzette on  
a function menu because they ate it once in a restaurant and liked it, only to find, on  
the day of the reception for 400 people, that only one member of the catering staff  
had ever prepared it before and had no chance whatsoever of producing more than  
20 an hour. This is one reason why many function caterers will test dishes in advance  
for a customer who requests something unusual. Food is only one example of the  
problem of expertise. An events organiser is best advised to list the expert knowledge  
of regular staff, or to ask the team of volunteers what they can do, what they have  
experience of, what their normal job is and what their hobbies are. Such a list will  
help identify where the staffing expertise lies and where it does not.  
Staffing is, therefore, as much an issue of identifying and utilising the expertise  
that exists, as having large numbers of people to do things, unless, of course, the  
event actually requires large numbers of people to do very simple tasks – but these  
still have to be organised in some way.  
# Finding staff  
# Recruiting paid staff  
The recruitment of paid staff can be done in a relatively conventional way, through  
advertising in newspapers or events trade magazines and associated websites.  
­ Marketing, tourism, leisure and hospitality magazines and websites are also common  
sources of staff for events. Paid staff can also be found through employment and  
staffing agencies, some of which specialise in various types of personnel, and these  
can be identified from the phone book and websites. For large-scale events more than  
one agency may be needed, and it is common for contracts to be signed to ensure that  
both parties know what is required. The quality of agency staff varies. Some staff  
work for an agency regularly and are both experienced and flexible, while others  
may attend your event as their first-ever job for the agency. Sources of potential paid  
staff include colleges and universities, where students are not only looking for a job  
on graduation, but may also be seeking part-time work whilst they are studying, to  
boost their income. Paid staff can also be sought through the internet \(newspapers  
and magazines duplicate job adverts on their websites as well as in their print edi-  
tions\) or by having a ‘work’ or ‘volunteer with us’ section of your own event website.  
There is quite a large body of ‘freelance’ staff available who may be self-employed or  
who may take event roles for short periods of time to accompany other jobs; indeed,  
one of the features of the events industry is that it has peaks and troughs of activity  
and freelance staff help balance these. Many companies which operate in the events  
business, especially those in hospitality and catering, retain staff records for events  
and activities held in a particular location. This enables them to use people whom  
they have previously employed for repeat events, especially casual and part-time  
staff. Lists are kept by geographical area, so if a particular venue is used frequently  
for different events, there is an existing pool of staff that can be called on. This also  
helps simply looking after the body of staff at an event, who, if paid, will need their

pay arrangements and other benefit issues attended to, as the event company may  
have some existing details \(including things like pay records\) rather than having to  
start up a whole staff cohort for an event from scratch.  
Getting staff may not always be easy for events companies. There are areas \(towns  
and cities\) where the local labour market is stretched, as most people have jobs and  
in those towns and cities with low employment finding part-time or casual staff can  
be extremely difficult. In such cases, staff may have to be transported to the event  
from some distance away so adding to the labour cost.  
# 271  
# Recruiting voluntary staff  
This can be done informally, by asking around friends, colleagues, acquaintances and  
relatives. For larger events such as festivals volunteer staff can be requested via the fes-  
tival website and this may yield a range of potential volunteers ranging from commu-  
nity helpers of all ages to students looking for voluntary jobs which might add useful  
skills to their curriculum vitae. This might well yield a range of helpers. However, it  
will be useful to explore what skills or talents they have, so that where a conventional  
application form for a job might explore a person’s background or job roles, an  
application form for volunteers should contain a ‘talent and skills’ section that will be  
significant in identifying what a volunteer can bring to your organisation and event.  
This could include previous experiences of events\: hobbies and pastimes; experience  
of groups, formal or informal, as a member or as part of a committee; whether they  
have even visited similar events, so that they know what one could be like \(even if  
not how to run it\); what the main elements of their normal work or daily roles are;  
what they did before they retired \(if appropriate\), and, most importantly of all, what  
they would be most interested in doing for the event as a volunteer \(see Figure 11.10\).  
This means that as event organisers we have to look at the event to identify the  
range of jobs and tasks that need to be done, and seek to match our available volun-  
teers to them. This matching is part of the selection process, and not all those who  
apply \(even volunteers\) are necessarily needed or suitable, with the result that some  
may have to be refused.  
There are various sources of volunteer staff. Firstly, volunteers immediately asso-  
ciated with an event or an event organisation as part of their job or hobby. This type  
of volunteer may be a member of a society, or a friend, relative or acquaintance of  
someone involved in that club or society. For example, an annual town flower show  
may be run by the Horticultural Club. In order to put on the event, members of the  
club will participate, members of its committee will organise friends and relatives of  
members may join in to help produce the show. Secondly, some events require large  
numbers of volunteers for which this type of informal personal networking approach  
may not be sufficient. In this case, a member of the organising committee will have  
to be responsible for getting volunteer labour or the task may even have to be given  
to a recruitment agency. In either case we would have to seek to attract volunteers  
by advertising in the local media, by making presentations to other interested vol-  
untary bodies, by networking \(word of mouth\), or by organising recruitment drives  
\(i.e. preparing a comprehensive plan about how many people you need, how you  
will attract them, what sort of network you might need to do so, etc.\) or by local  
advertising with small posters or leaflets at community centres, sports clubs, leisure  
centres, shop windows, other volunteer organisations, youth and retirement groups  
and local and special interest groups.

Finally, we have assumed up to this point that volunteers are individuals, but a  
large-scale event might involve not only the key organising body, but also a range of  
voluntary bodies that wish to participate. This is the case with carnivals and festivals,  
where a central coordinating body may well be the focus for the activities of a wide  
range of participants, from commercial organisations to voluntary bodies, charitable  
organisations, and so on. The success of staffing the event depends on the coopera-  
tion between them and may have to involve some orientation, meeting together and  
cooperative efforts.  
# Recruiting permanent staff  
In order to achieve sufficiently high standards of service and management of events  
it is necessary to employ people with adequate skills and provide additional training.  
Even if individual events are short-lived, events management companies, production  
companies and caterers require permanent staff as they are dealing with an entire  
business composed of events of all kinds in venues and sites within their geographical

area. Historically, the acquisition of suitable staff for events management has been  
achieved by two main methods\:  
•  the employment of staff with a good basic education to be trained by the  
organisation and developed as a skilled member of staff and/or as a manager  
•  the employment of staff with an appropriate vocational and educational  
background in the field or a related field.  
The first method, effectively on-the-job training, is the most prevalent for opera-  
tional staff. Staff and managers have been developed in-house by experience or by the  
company providing some form of basic training. In the case of relatively unskilled jobs,  
such as steward leaders or stage crew, these have usually been based on recruiting a per-  
son with satisfactory potential and good handling skills who can learn the job through  
the experience of working with existing staff. This method is sometimes backed up by  
short-course training in addition to fundamental activities such as induction and fire  
training. On this basis, it is still possible for a member of staff to work their way up  
over time through an organisation to supervisory or management level by experience.  
The second method, based on vocational education, provides not only operational  
staff but also supervisors and managers. Larger organisations recruit from colleges or  
universities running appropriate courses and then tend to add their own programme  
or training course to develop managers with a specific knowledge of their company.  
Yet it must be noted that there are limited event industry-specific further or higher  
education courses offered around Europe, although this is beginning to change quite  
rapidly. In order to recruit, say, a junior event coordinator, the most likely educa-  
tional background would be vocational courses in the hospitality and catering field,  
in leisure and recreation, or in some business studies courses where the programme  
contains events management as a subject or module. These range from courses at  
the operations level to undergraduate courses at degree level. At degree level some  
colleges and universities include event management modules or events management  
pathways to their degrees, and some postgraduate programmes are offered too. Other  
potential sources of vocationally educated people are found in the field of\: travel and  
tourism, sales and marketing, sport and leisure and business administration. Typi-  
cally, people employed from these areas, particularly the hospitality field, will have  
a good background knowledge of business generally and some awareness of events  
as an activity, but will still need specific training, for two reasons\:  
• Every organisation is different.  
• Every job is different.  
Even using graduates from those colleges and universities where the degree pro-  
gramme contains a specific events element, an events company will need to tailor the  
graduates employed to its particular organisation and their role. Nevertheless, there is  
a good level of cooperation between educational establishments and events companies  
and bodies. This can involve industry cooperation with assignment work and field  
visits or even year-long paid placements for undergraduate students. By this method  
the events industry not only influences the curriculum content of courses, but also  
provides ‘seed corn’ for future employment amongst interested students. A number of  
the companies providing year placements may well employ some of the placement stu-  
dents \(‘interns’\) once the latter have completed their course. This symbiotic system is  
particularly well established between events venues and the larger hotel schools. Being  
mutually beneficial it is often seen as a model of good practice for other industries.

In addition to the above, the ebb and flow of employment in general provides a  
large number of staff and managers within the events business. People move jobs  
from one location to another or move into events management from related fields  
\(e.g. hotels, tourism, retail, catering, business travel\). Some are newly employed in  
their first job or are staff being transferred around larger, more diverse organisations  
that may include several divisions as well as types of events. All these methods con-  
tribute to the supply of potential staff. Some are better trained than others, but in  
all cases there is a good business argument for organisations to have a well-trained,  
well-motivated and well-managed staff \(Conway, 2014\). This also is the reason why  
many organisations have a defined staff development policy, progression routes and  
comprehensive staff training programmes, some of which are targeted at quality  
issues such as the ‘Investors in People programme’, and are intended to achieve not  
only high levels of staff training and good service for visitors, but also to achieve  
public recognition in general.  
# Running the event on the day  
For all the considerable effort that goes into planning an event, running it on the day  
can still prove a challenge. The coordination of a wide range of disparate and even  
unusual activities, facilities and services can be overwhelming. Events management  
has to be effective, and events managers must be good communicators and good  
delegators in situations that may be constantly changing. Detailed and thorough  
planning plays an important role in reducing the variability and uncertainty of what  
takes place during the event and allows the event coordinator to prioritise those  
things that require attention. For the event coordinator some elements are essential  
on the day of the event\:  
• Drink enough water so you don’t dehydrate.  
• Eat enough, otherwise your decision-making and problem-solving abilities will  
decline.  
• Wear the most comfortable pair of shoes you’ve got, and  
• Keep a change of clothes somewhere convenient, because you never know if  
some fool is accidentally going to spill a drink all over you.  
The nature of the events business is such that each occasion is unique, and a pro-  
duction line approach can rarely be adopted. The activities undertaken to provide  
one event effectively may not necessarily accomplish the next quite so effectively,  
although there are clearly common features. Thus, the recurrence of routine tends  
to be in the framework – in the approach, organisation and management, rather  
than in the implementation or the operation. On a simple level, the same ordering  
system can be used almost universally for all events; but the number of people, the  
timing, the amount of supplies and requirements will be unique for each event.  
It is this uniqueness that systems and staff must be sufficiently flexible to cope  
with. Systems and staff are intended to work hand in hand. In general, to reduce  
costs, especially labour costs, if an operation can be systematised or automated, it  
should be, but this supposes a more or less standard product. Nevertheless, many  
event-related activities, such as food production, can be systematised; whether this  
is cookery according to standard recipes or whether it is the buying in of a standard  
dish from a supplier.

FACTBOX  
• Deventer Boekenmarkt  
• Attracts some 120,000 visitors  
• 850 stalls with more than 6 km of shelves  
• Has become one of the biggest book fairs in Europe  
• Associated activities include music, street theatre and an evening poetry festival  
in the gardens of the Bouwkunde Theatre  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the organisation of an event  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider the way in which a modest event is organised and how many ‘supervisory’ staff it  
needs on its operating day\(s\).  
• To determine why the event is important to the calendar of activities of a particular location and  
how it fits into an overall programme of annual events.  
• To understand that not all events are suited to a single type of organisation.  
**T** he fine old eastern Dutch city of Deventer, in  
the province of Overijssel, famous for its history  
as a member of the Hanseatic League \(an associa-  
tion of medieval trading cities in Northern Europe\),  
holds a number of events each year. In 2018 these  
include the annual Book Market; the Christmas  
Dickens Festival, Deventer Royal Festival; the Inter-  
national Street Theatre Festival\: Deventer on Stilts;  
and many smaller events in the city and nearby  
‘Op Den Berghe’ \(a popular medieval festival\). The

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. **276 Chapter 11** The organisation manager and the team\: during the event  
Book Market, held each year on the first Sunday in  
August, attracts not only the general public, but also  
booksellers and antiquarians from throughout the  
Netherlands and other parts of Europe.  
The Deventer Book Market is organised by the  
events bureau of the Deventer Tourism Department  
\(Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer\: VVV\). The  
department has the equivalent of some 12-and-a-  
half staff \(some full-time and some part-time\) who  
cover five departments. The organisation and run-  
ning of events is funded from a range of sources,  
including Deventer City Council; local business  
members of the organisation \(such as catering,  
retail and market trade businesses\), sponsoring  
organisations and through admission charges and  
related income, such as the sale of programmes,  
city maps, etc.  
For the running of the event, an operating group  
of five to six key people, including the Director of the  
Bureau and their assistant, plus, at most, a further  
15–20 helpers will be on the ground during the Book  
Market to coordinate activities. This is deliberately  
not a large number in order to prevent confusion. It  
also ensures that the Director can maintain informal  
contacts with participants, visitors, local businesses  
and officials to ensure the smooth running of the  
event. This process is, in effect, management by  
walking around. Contact is maintained by mobile  
phones and the Director is seen to be there.  
The Book Market attracts between 90,000 and  
120,000 people each year. This varies according to  
the weather and other incidental factors \(e.g. alter-  
native events\). The measurement of attendance is  
done by comparison of data from sales outlets \(e.g.  
comparing the event days’ sales of ice cream against  
a normal day’s sales\), also from information supplied  
by the railway company \(Nederlandse Spoorwegen,  
which is able to report the difference in ticket sales  
to Deventer for the Sunday of the Book Market as  
against a normal summer Sunday\). Knowing the  
number of people who travel to the market by rail,  
as a proportion of the total number, allows the total  
number to be estimated. However, the number of  
visitors is not always promoted in press releases, as  
the attendance clearly varies, and also the amount  
visitors spend. In one year there might be more vis-  
itors who spend less, and the next, fewer visitors  
who spend more – there is considerable variation,  
even though averages can be given, such as an  
average spend for day trippers of about €25 a day.  
\(This helps prevent negative press coverage.\)  
The Book Market and the other major festivals,  
the Royal Festival, Dickens Festival, Deventer on  
Stilts, Op Den Berghe and many smaller comedy  
festivals and day events, are key to the strategy that  
the events bureau operates.  
This strategy has a number of central objectives\:  
• to stimulate cultural tourism in Deventer and its  
nearby region of Overijssel  
• to generate added value for tourists to  
Deventer  
• to improve the marketing and the image of  
the city  
• to generate positive publicity in order to attract  
tourists

# Discussion Questions  
**1** How is the organisation of the Book ­ Market  
undertaken? Is this type of organisation  
­ suitable for all kinds of events?  
**2** In what way do the festivals in Deventer satisfy  
the strategic objectives of the VVV?  
**3** What reasons, including the weather, might  
there be for variations in visitor numbers and  
average spend at an event?  
**4** How might the media react to changes in  
published visitor numbers when headlining  
their stories, and would the view taken by the  
media make the strategic objectives difficult  
to fulfil?  
**5** Identify a festival or event in your district and  
consider how that event fits in with the style,  
environment, history or surroundings of the  
place.

The maintenance of standards in non-routine service activities is a signifi-  
cant concern of management in the events business. The non-routine and non-systematised  
nature of anything from site layout to variances in individual audience  
requirements needs to be accommodated by allowing flexibility of operations,  
whilst maintaining thorough supervision and control. Simple managerial control  
may be exercised by detailed supervision and the use of checklists; by techniques  
such as ‘management by exception’, or by improving the quality of staff and staff  
training to the level at which quality control can largely be placed in the hands  
of the staff themselves. This can be difficult in short-life organisations at events,  
because there is limited time for training staff and limited time to get to know what  
abilities they have.  
Perhaps the most common management technique used by events coordinators  
is ‘management by wandering around’. Draw up a checklist of things you need to  
keep an eye on and give yourself a route to go around, preferably covering your  
main department leaders and those places you regard as ‘pinch points’ – where  
things are likeliest to go wrong, or be busiest, or need support at crucial times. A  
regular events coordinator will know this from previous experience, but for the  
beginner, the best advice is to follow through what your potential visitors will do,  
including driving into the visitor’s car park when you arrive and entering the site  
or venue through the same entrance that they will. In this way you will find out in  
time if locations are signposted badly, if the area is not clean enough, and so on.  
Do a walk-through of all the things a visitor will do, including the toilets. Test the  
things a visitor will ask for. For example, have a coffee in the catering tent – don’t  
just get a coffee and walk out, take it and sit where the visitors will sit, do what  
the visitor will do because in doing so you will find unexpected aspects or small  
hidden problems that can make or break people’s experience of your event \(see  
Figure 11.11\).

Above all, communicate actively and frequently as you do your rounds. It is  
important that you delegate wherever you can, so that your regular staff learn to  
handle and solve problems for themselves; step in if you have to, but remember, you  
are the last resort, and you should not be trying to sort out minor problems when  
your staff could do so on their own. In fact, as a manager, if you have to do tasks that  
your people should be capable of, then you have failed\: you have failed to educate  
them in their abilities and remits; you have failed to give them the resources and  
confidence to do their job.  
# Organisation and briefing of staff, stewards  
# and volunteers  
In running an event on the day, you cannot handle everything yourself, and will  
have a number of helpers, whether professional or volunteer. Your event needs to  
have a structure of organisation, in effect a chain of command, in order to operate  
properly, as noted earlier in this chapter. On the day of the event you will have

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. Organisation and briefing of staff, stewards and volunteers  
to rely on your heads of department and their management skills, as well as your  
own. For many events, however, you may have a large number of staff who are  
present only for the event itself. They will have to be properly briefed. If you have  
volunteers or casual staff they need to be orientated as effectively as full-time or  
regular staff. If you have an event where you have volunteers, you should have a  
Volunteer Coordinator to look after them, to orientate them via a briefing or short  
induction and to act as a point of contact for them during the event. You must take  
due care\: volunteers need to be properly covered by insurance, by health and safety  
procedures and by the normal ways in which you would support regular staff, for  
example in terms of the provision of support facilities, rest areas, toilets, and drinks  
and meals. Significantly, volunteer staff are often involved in events because the  
event has some charitable, philanthropic or community benefit and they may feel  
that their effort is benefiting that good cause. For this reason, positive feedback  
should be given to volunteers about their contribution and efforts, and, where at all  
possible, there should be staff activities which bring enjoyment and pleasure. Get a  
laugh going; remember you can sing; have a pillow fight; go to the bar afterwards,  
have a drink and tell jokes. At the end of an event or at some point in the course  
of a long-running event give your people some pleasant enjoyment, to encourage  
happiness and to celebrate what has been achieved. Do not invite the media to these  
events, the media tends to regard enjoyment as a bad thing and may make a fuss if  
your staff let their hair down.  
The tasks which volunteers can help with vary according to the type of event, but  
can include\:  
• looking after charitable sales or stands  
• helping with raffles or games  
• selling programmes  
• directing cars to car parks or visitors to their seats  
• providing information  
• handing out leaflets or sitemaps  
• acting as welcome hosts to direct people and answer questions  
• acting as individual VIP liaison or disabled helpers  
• providing general visitor, spectator or crew services such as staffing water  
stands  
• dealing with registration or cloakrooms  
• giving out samples or goody bags  
• timekeeping or marshalling at sports events  
• dealing with logistics such as helping set up and break down exhibitions or  
small shows  
• moving of small equipment or items to be displayed or put on show. In the case  
of the latter they may need some training in manual handling.  
Training and certification is also an issue in some other aspects of event organ-  
isation, such as the provision of catering and food; the provision of first aid  
support; aspects of health and safety including crowd control and the care of lost  
children, or the operation of a crèche or children’s area \(for which special care  
in the selection of staff and the checking of their certifications must be made\);

as well as many smaller activities ranging from cashing up of tills to the use of  
cleaning equipment and materials. In all these cases it is important to remember  
the need for the member of staff to understand their duties, who to ask for advice  
and who the formal manager of an event is. We must bear in mind, however, that  
not everyone is suited to every task and with volunteers, in particular, their views  
must be closely listened to, and if they feel in any way incapable of performing  
a role they should be found a suitable alternative. It is also important that if we  
are using lots of volunteer staff, the heads of section or team leaders should be  
regular staff or at least more thoroughly trained, so that the section has some  
experience to it.  
Let us consider some specifics in terms of, say, the Stewards Department or Team.  
In order for the stewards and guides to work effectively, they must understand their  
role and responsibilities. This may be achieved through briefings prior to the event,  
or as part of a comprehensive induction or training session for all staff \(records of  
which must be kept\). In the case of a small event it could be done on the day. The  
briefing session would normally cover a number of key issues\:  
•  Responsibilities for health and safety of visitors and participants, and the  
reporting mechanism for urgent problems, how to get help and the sequence of  
call-up of managers in an emergency.  
•  A tour of the layout of the site, highlighting emergency exits, assembly points,  
toilets, catering and other facilities, access for disabled visitors and for emer-  
gency vehicles or staff.  
•  Issues in crowd management; the operation, opening and closing of exits;  
ensuring that emergency exits are open throughout the event.  
•  How to direct and help the public, audience or participants and the need for a  
calm and courteous approach to all involved.  
•  How to recognise and act on signs of crowd or individual distress; how to deal  
with overcrowding by dispersal or by the opening of further exits or entrances  
to overflow space.  
•  What action to take in the event of an accumulation of rubbish or fire risk;  
action to take if a fire is found; how to raise the alarm; how to respond to a  
small fire or small emergency.  
•  The mechanism for communication between stewards and managers; the use  
of coded messages to identify types of emergencies and planned responses  
to them.  
Stewards, guides and similar members of staff should be easy to identify by  
means of colourful or ‘high-visibility’ jackets, tabards or sashes. These may also  
carry easily identifiable numbers which should be clearly visible. Stewards might  
typically not be under 18 years of age; but this is not an absolute\: consider non-  
safety critical activities such as hosting or helping as a means of introducing young  
people to events, this does not equate to meaning that younger people should not  
have safety training or briefing. There must be no consumption of alcohol or other  
substances while the steward is on duty, nor should any of them leave their allo-  
cated posts without permission or relief \(HSE, 2017\). The Chief Steward should  
have a rota in place so that no one spends too long a period doing the same perhaps  
repetitive job and to ensure that stewards are adequately provided for in terms of  
refreshment and personal needs breaks.

# Problem-solving  
In making decisions and solving problems, it is vital to be aware of the factors that  
have led to the problem and to be able to take the correct action. It may be that you  
have to take action first and ask questions later, but it is essential to ask the questions,  
otherwise you might fail again\: by failing to identify the source and origin of a prob-  
lem correctly, it will re occur, and you may not be able to extricate yourself and the  
event from it the next time. A good decision is therefore dependent on the recognition  
of the right problem. Bear in mind the media reaction to disasters. At the Roskilde  
Music Festival, the media claimed that nine deaths were due to faulty loudspeakers.  
The loudspeakers were in perfect working order, and the cause was simply the weight  
of numbers of people at the front. In the 2000 Concorde airliner disaster in Paris,  
the media at first claimed that the catastrophic engine fire was caused by a faulty  
repair done hastily before the plane took off. The engines were working perfectly  
and the disaster was caused by a small piece of metal on the runway that led to a  
series of improbable but ‘explosive’ failures in the undercarriage, the wing, the fuel  
tanks and then the engines. In short, if you have an event problem, be sure to try to  
identify the real cause, even if this means thinking about it later on and consulting  
others who were involved.  
In your efforts to solve problems and make decisions, keep a notebook in your  
pocket and take a minute to write the problem down, as well as what you did to sort  
it out. For those events where you are running a new edition or a repeat of an event  
you have run before, make sure you take the time to look at last year’s feedback  
notes and any questionnaires that were given out. In this way you can help avoid  
problems happening again, or concentrate resources in places where you think they  
might recur. Work steadily through the event, take breaks when you can, sit down  
when you can and take drinks when you can. It is important that you pace yourself.

# Summary  
**T** he organisation and staffing of an event, its coordination and man-  
agement, are all factors integral to its success. It is arguable that for  
certain kinds of events as much can be achieved with talented amateurs  
and enthusiastic volunteers as with professional paid staff. However, there  
is a place for both professional and volunteer staff in the events business.  
Events are varied and diverse, and their organisation and staffing reflect  
this.

# Introduction  
It’s three o’clock in the morning, your guests have just gone, having eaten you out  
of house and home, told assorted improbable stories and drunk all your best wine.  
You are happy that your dinner party went well and also exhausted. Best to shut the  
door on the dining room and leave the washing up until tomorrow. Of course, if it’s  
three in the morning and you are the coordinator at a major event venue where the  
guests have just gone, you might still have a whole night’s work ahead of you. The  
close-down of an event should be approached in much the same structured way as  
it is set up, and remember the lesson often quoted in the mountain climbing world\:  
most accidents don’t happen on the way up, but on the way down. At the end of a  
long event, you and your staff will be tired, many will want to get cleared up and  
go home, but it is important to be able to handle the close-down and to clear up  
properly, and carefully.  
Once the whole operation is closed down and handed back, there is still some  
administration to be done. This can be anything from recording to sorting out the  
accounts, paying the bills, or collecting questionnaires. The final administrative  
details need to be completed, and the event – especially if it is to happen again in the  
future – should be properly evaluated to see what can be learned from it and what  
could be done better next time, not only from the visitors’ point of view, but also  
from your own organisational point of view; it is valuable to look back and assess  
the outcome.  
For some events there will be no next time. The purpose may have been strictly  
limited to a one–time–only activity, although in some of these cases, especially where  
the objective was economic or social in origin, there may be various legacies, some  
intended, some perhaps unintended. The significance of such legacies may have been  
carefully planned – this is particularly the case for regeneration events. Often, how-  
ever, it is physical regeneration that is planned, and social regeneration comes as a  
surprise.  
For those events that do have a next time they may continue to take place for  
many years. However, there are a range of reasons why even events that have been  
successful over a long period of time come to an end or are closed down. These can  
be anything from the loss of a key organiser to gradual decline because of changes  
in the circumstances in which the event has been run.  
# Close-down  
There are several elements to closing down an event. Besides clearing out the venue  
and closing the doors, there will be a range of administrative tasks to tie up. These  
will include the completion of the accounts, payment of final bills to contractors, and  
final marketing activities such as closure press releases and providing information  
about future plans or next year’s event, if there is to be one. There will also be various  
personnel issues to complete, in particular the final payments to all staff, the updating  
of staff records for future reference, together with the need to do some evaluation of  
the event \(see Figure 12.1\).  
The most obvious close-down activities are the physical ones\: the big clear-up once  
the doors have closed and the last visitors have gone. This should be approached in  
much the same way as the set-up. A work break-down schedule can be created, based

in part on the activities leading up to the opening, but in reverse. Understanding that  
there is a sequence to follow for close-down is significant; otherwise people will make  
inappropriate attempts to get their gear out before it is safe to do so. In the same  
way that it is important for everyone to know how to set up, it is also essential for  
them to know how to break down. This information can be handed out in a sum-  
mary sheet to staff during the event, and in a close-down briefing given over a meal  
immediately following the public’s departure; otherwise you will be overrun with  
tired and frustrated people wanting to throw their stuff in a truck, without knowing  
that the truck doesn’t arrive for another hour \(Conway, 2014\).  
As a general rule, the clear–up operation moves from small items to large ones.  
You cannot get the stage down until you have cleared the equipment and the furni-  
ture. You cannot clear these items until you have cleared at least some of the litter,  
and collected and stored small valuable items. Staff should be properly briefed on  
this process, and control maintained till the very end, for reasons of safety and also  
for security of goods and equipment. Some tasks can be done in parallel \(at the same  
time\), providing there are enough staff to do them, and the various departmental  
leaders should continue to supervise these activities. Items of stock to be reused, such  
as catering stock, linen, consumables and small equipment should be returned to a  
central storage place prior to collection. Afterwards, this stock can then be returned  
to the stores, or to the supplier, or to your contractor’s central depot.  
Exit routes for goods, equipment and materials should ideally be separate from  
public exit routes, which might still be busy whilst the event is being closed down.  
Congestion is often a problem, particularly at large-scale outdoor events. The  
removal of utilities will also need to be carefully considered in terms of what goes  
last. Remember you will still have people on site clearing up, so don’t cut off the  
power or remove all the toilets straight away; see what can be removed first and  
what can wait till last. In many sites, there will be some permanent supplies and  
utilities, but it can be surprising how many do not have them, and this needs to be  
taken into account.  
Where an event is being closed down it is important to leave the site or venue in  
the condition it was found, even if this means pictures of the site had to be taken  
before the event to ensure everything has been correctly replaced when it is over.  
It is also essential where there are existing facilities that these are restored to their  
correct standard before leaving, to ensure the cleaning has been done properly, that  
the consumable items have been restocked and that anything accidentally broken  
has been repaired or paid for. In many cases these functions are carried out by venue  
managements and organisations, but where an event has used an unusually sensitive  
site or venue, perhaps for a one-off activity particular care needs to be taken.

• Three-day event involving 62 international players  
• Large crowds to watch the golf  
• Top prize of approximately €1 million  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the issues involved in the close-down and clearing up of  
an event site. with the following objectives\:  
• To examine the effect on the facilities or services of large numbers of the public being present at  
an event site.  
• To highlight what issues might emerge in terms of wear and tear of a site and what steps can  
be taken to ensure wear and tear damage can be easily put right.  
• To consider how the closing sequence of an event should be planned and undertaken.  
**T**he international golf course at Valderrama is one  
of Europe’s principal courses and hosts peri-  
odic major events of the kind which often rotate to  
different countries or provinces and venues each  
year, including the World Championship \(in 2000\),  
and the Spanish Open \(fairly frequently and most  
recently in 2016\).  
Clearing an event site after large-scale events  
can be a major task. It can involve anything from the  
removal of large amounts of litter, debris and other  
general waste, to having to restore lawns, gardens  
and other natural features. Many events are run in  
locations that are sensitive to use by large numbers  
of people, and care has to be taken that crowds do

not damage the area and its surroundings. This is  
particularly the case for open-air events.  
The arrangements for major golf tournaments  
require particular care. Crowds of up to 100,000  
people are often possible, putting huge strain on the  
resources at golf courses. For major tournaments,  
stands have to be built, facilities provided for the  
media, including locations for broadcasts and media  
centres for journalists and other reporters. Additional  
facilities and power have to be provided, to cover  
catering and refreshments, first aid, toilets, retailing,  
and so on. Thoughtful crowd control at Valderrama  
is absolutely essential, in order to prevent accidental  
damage from large numbers of people to the course  
itself, to the fairways and greens. As a consequence,  
most facilities, including parking, tend to be kept  
away from the main course, and walking routes for  
the crowd to watch the golf play are carefully set up,  
roped off and controlled by stewards. The course  
at Valderrama is extremely well kept and is known  
for its ecological approach. This being the case,  
areas of the course are kept isolated from the public  
because of the presence of wildlife and rare plants.  
Although the clear-up period is relatively short, as  
the site is more or less clear of its extra structures  
and equipment within a week, the repair to the areas  
used by large numbers of visitors, especially if there  
is damage to the ground as a result of heavy public  
use, takes the green-keepers and grounds people  
a great deal of time. For example, where the green  
areas have to be re-sown, the new grass may take  
up to six months to properly grow again.  
The process of clearing up after a championship  
is quite intensive \(see diagram\)\:

how could you attempt to mitigate the effects  
of large crowds on open–air sites?  
**3** How can you plan the close–down of a site, and  
in what order should items be removed?  
Be sufficiently prepared for the clear-up operation\: consider not only the tasks, but  
also the number of people and equipment you will need to do the job. Many such  
operations are held up because of shortage of even the most basic equipment, such  
as brushes, mops, buckets, cleaning materials and refuse sacks. Have these various  
items stored and ready for collection at a specified time by department leaders, so  
that you can get the work done speedily.  
Much of the equipment, materials and resources you use for your event will be  
recoverable for reuse. Ensure that you have an efficient and careful storekeeper to col-  
lect this material, record what has been returned, take stock and calculate any losses.  
Careful storekeeping and the ability to redeploy equipment and other materials may  
save a great deal of money and effort next time, especially for those things that are often  
overlooked at the planning stage, such as electrical extension leads, special signs and  
small administrative equipment. From the returned materials, experienced administra-  
tors will prepare ‘ready boxes’ of basic office supplies such as tape, scissors, staplers,  
glue, Blu-Tack, Velcro fixings, pens, etc., so that a box can be taken out of stores for  
the next event and used easily, without wasting time chasing round for a box of staples  
or a washable marker pen. Many contracting organisations take the same approach.  
Contract caterers will collect, wash, stock-take, then recount and box items, such as  
crockery or cutlery \(for example into batches of ten\) ready for their next use.  
It is also the case that in addition to the predicable reuse of essential and recov-  
erable materials, the close-down process should also take into account recycling.  
Festivals and outdoor events particularly produce huge amounts of litter, waste, junk  
and perhaps some other rather undesirable items. Yet within this possibly vast pile of  
dross are items which could be recycled and you may already have set up recycling  
bins or other facilities to do this, or made arrangements with local organisations who  
deal in this activity and who can recycle and reuse materials in a sustainable way.  
If there is an element of organisation that is neglected by venues and organisers,  
it is the close-down. This includes the fact that some effort should be made to ensure  
that all went well. Coordinators should be around to speak to visitors and VIPs on  
departure to obtain verbal feedback and pick up comments. Comments need noting  
as part of a quality control cycle, and can be recorded as part of the ‘event history’  
to be referred to next time round. Even relatively simple issues such as the speakers  
preferring lapel microphones, or the need to have some spare umbrellas in the central  
office, whilst not being perceived as very serious, are significant to that event and one  
less worry at the next edition. In addition, particular care should be taken to record  
contact information about participants, exhibitors, presenters, stand providers, and

so on, in order to make the job of contacting people easier for a new edition \(see

Notes, history, remarks and special requirements  
It is essential to thank all those involved, in particular key staff, in writing, ‘as you  
never know who you might need again’. In any case, it is both good manners and a  
courtesy. In particular, thanks to volunteers and members of the community for their  
efforts are important, and this is also a matter of good relationship marketing for future  
events. On the subject of relationship marketing, if you are going to repeat this event,

did you put the next date in the programmes and on the event website? You want  
people to return, so start by helping the process along. Again, various people may be  
interested in your event organisation or the venue, and whilst they would not normally  
step out of their way to obtain information, can be asked for their business card or  
address as they leave and information can be despatched to them. A sales opportunity  
is a sales opportunity, and personal contact is far more effective than advertising.  
The final administrative issues about event close-down are those regarding con-  
tract acquittal, dealing with outstanding bills and completing the accounts. Contract  
acquittal is not only a matter of making final payments to contractors and suppliers,  
but also of deciding, for the future, whether a supplier has done a good job. Key to  
our own success as event organisers is the ability to have the materials and supplies  
required, delivered in the way in which they were ordered, on time and correctly. A  
good relationship with contractors and suppliers is therefore vital, and one of the  
functions of contract acquittal is to identify those companies that will be retained  
for the future, and those that may have to be changed.  
Preparation of the final accounts for the event will be a matter for the treasurer,  
financial officer, or our own accountants. These final accounts will tell us how the  
event went financially. Where an event has run in the public domain \(i.e. one that is  
not commercially private\) the accounts will need to be published as part of a final  
report to the client body, which might be government, local councils, or other fund-  
ing or sponsoring bodies. In any case, a copy of the accounts should be included in  
our event history file for future reference and as an aid to planning any new edition.  
# 291  
# Evaluation  
A short period after the close-down of the event, certainly within a month, there should  
be a meeting of the various interested parties \(organisers, clients, ­ sponsors, etc.\) to  
evaluate the event. The evaluation should use all the various sources of information  
available \(see Figure 12.3\) and should consider not only the visitor’s perception of  
the event, but also that of the organisers, because lessons may need to be learned  
from all points of view \(Bowdin et al., 2011\). The potential sources of information  
are quite extensive. However, it should be noted that many events, especially smaller  
ones, record and keep very little information; sometimes only the number of people  
who bought tickets and what the various departments took or sold. This limitation  
is due in part to lack of expertise \(or interest\) in recording or collecting useful infor-  
mation. For events management and similar companies, the need to get going with  
the next event can result in insufficient time to either collect information or review

what has been collected. However, care in evaluation is an aid to future planning and  
should not be overlooked.  
One of the limitations of evaluation is the inability to make use of the process.  
Most events organisations will have a meeting to review major events, but the pro-  
cess may end there. ‘We had the meeting and we’ll look at the minutes of it next year  
when we start planning the next edition . . .’ \(an intention that is then forgotten\).  
The purpose of evaluation is for managers to learn how an event went and to be  
able to improve on it for the future. This ‘improvement’ can be looked at in several  
ways\: firstly, there might be activities that went well but could be strengthened fur-  
ther; secondly, there are activities that went well in such a way that they are best left  
untouched; thirdly, there are those activities that went badly and will need sorting  
out. These issues have to be evaluated, and even where only a modest amount of  
information is collected, perhaps by formal means \(e.g. questionnaires\), there might  
be a lot of underused information sources \(see Figure 12.4\).

There are quite a large number of sources of information, even for a small event  
where no formal research has been done. For example, a debriefing of stewards or  
the whole event staff together might lead to useful insights \(van der Wagen, 2011\).  
However, where feedback or evaluation information is unstructured, we must be  
careful about its use, otherwise the analysis of it could be based on little other than  
someone’s opinion, which may be worthless, without support. There are probably  
two key evaluation issues\:  
• Did the event meet its objectives?  
• What can be improved for the next time \(if there is going to be one\)?  
A review of the event objectives, in light of the information available, needs to  
be done, not only for the satisfaction of the event coordinator, but also to enable

stakeholders to be reassured about the event’s effectiveness, and also, if stakeholders  
such as councils, sponsors and clients put money into the event, that the money was  
well spent. This is the reason for the publication of final reports and accounts, par-  
ticularly for big public events.  
The usefulness of some formal or structured research and observation at events  
becomes most obvious when looking at what might need to be done for future edi-  
tions. The identification and solving of problems can only be carried out properly if  
there is enough information to ascertain the real cause of a problem. It is no good  
saying\: ‘We had many complaints in the beer tent, when the beer ran out . . .’ We need  
to know the causal origin. If the apparent cause was the beer running out, why was  
this? Was it under-ordering, or high demand, or did the beer delivery get stuck in the  
mud? Without adequate information we cannot deal with this problem and prevent  
it happening again. Related to this is the question of how to allocate resources and  
time to solving problems. What were the major problems, were they serious and did  
they constitute critical failures in the eyes of our visitors?  
In general, knowing what is best or worst about an event will help to increase  
satisfaction levels and reduce dissatisfaction – a process that may also help identify  
persistent problem areas that need time and effort to solve. By collecting and collating  
the ‘problem area’ information you can then rank the problems in order of priority  
or seriousness, ‘Most serious to least serious’ or ‘Most frequently stated to least fre-  
quently stated’. Then, having set out this list of priorities, you can attack and sort  
out the most serious problems, so that in the next event edition, they will not reoccur  
or at least they will be less of an inconvenience for your visitors and you will have  
improved the visitor’s experience of your event. Once a particular problem has been  
identified, it is best to give the task of sorting it out to one person who has the author-  
ity and the means to do so, or to a small sub-group of the organising committee,  
than to have the problem discussed endlessly in big committees and not get solved.  
In any list of problems, the ones that cause the most difficulty should be dealt  
with first, and to do this we need to be able to measure the impact of a problem.  
When we are looking informally at our list of problems, it might simply be down to  
a ‘gut feeling’ about which would be the best to solve, because, given limited man-  
agement time and expertise, not every problem on a list can be dealt with \(although  
some of the lesser problems could perhaps be given to junior staff  
or volunteer helpers, as this might result in more creative solutions  
than professionals might provide\). On the other hand, we might be  
running a major event again next year, and the effort put into evalu-  
ative problem–solving might be well worth the effort. Feedback of all  
kinds might have to be included in this approach, to ensure that we  
have a complete picture of the issues, hence the need for some kind  
of measurement which would enable us to allocate resources or effort  
to solving key problems or issues which have emerged.  
This type of approach is used in various industries. For example,  
British railway companies use a system known as Golden Asset Iden-  
tification. Delays to trains are analysed by cause, and the total delay  
to trains caused by physical assets is measured in minutes. This is then  
costed, so that the total cost of an asset failure or specific problem is  
known. Problems are then ranked by severity, and the cost of solving  
pink\_cotton\_candy/iStock  
them is compared with the cost of delays. By this method it has been  
found that very large delays \(and costs\) can sometimes be solved at  
very small cost indeed. Suppose that a set of points \(track turn-outs\)

near a major station has been identified as the cause of regular delays – perhaps  
20,000 minutes of delays to trains up and down the line. The cost is €10 a minute  
\(less than the real cost, but a convenient figure to use\). The total cost of the problem is  
€200,000 a year. The track engineers say that the wrong grease is being used to  
keep the points moving because someone decided to buy cheap grease that was  
€20 a can less expensive than the proper grease. In this case the cost of solving a  
€200,000 problem is €20 a year, as one can of grease lasts a year. For those who think  
this is a fictitious problem, the set of points is just south of Purley in south London.  
How can event managers use this approach? It might be felt that an event is more  
of a personal service activity than a railway, events being less dependent on physical  
assets, but it is a useful place to start. Here is a sample visitor satisfaction report from  
our good friends, the Middleburg Music Festival \(Figure 12.5\).  
Figure 12.5 Visitor satisfaction at the Middleburg Music Festival

In this example there is a problem with parking. It might be a problem for sev-  
eral reasons\: not enough space, not enough access, everyone leaves at once creating  
a queue, and so on. In short, the problem may be quite complicated to solve and  
need several approaches. In order to solve it, we need more information from other  
sources, not just the visitor survey. In regard to the car park, there are two other  
sources of information. The first comes in the form of the ‘mystery guest’ reports  
\(see Figure 12.6\). The festival organisers employed six people from the local univer-  
sity \(three lecturers and three students\) to visit the festival as customers and prepare  
a structured report about their individual experiences.  
Figure 12.6 Mystery guest report \(extract\)  
QUESTION 2  
Were access and parking arrangements adequate?  
*No, I found a great deal of difficulty getting out of the car park. Firstly, there was a huge*  
*queue as the car park was not properly marked out, so cars were not flowing in the right*  
*direction but crossing over each other before they could get to the exit. The exit was*  
*hard to see out of because of overgrown bushes on the roadside and it was amazing*  
*there were no accidents because of the speed of people coming down the main road*  
*and then being surprised by festival visitors trying to pull out of the car park.*

In this example, the mystery guest report was corroborated from a second source,  
the Head Car Park Steward\: ‘Yes, the car park was a mess to get out of; you took  
your life in your hands when you pulled out onto the main road. We set up signs  
saying ‘concealed entrance slow down’, but they didn’t look official enough so many  
drivers on the main road ignored them.’  
The problem is an obvious one, and has a safety issue, so action is essential, with-  
out a need to measure it. But the reader may wish to give some thought to how this  
kind of problem could be measured. The solution, in this example, may include better  
liaison with the road authority and the police to have a temporary speed restriction  
applied to the main road, have official signs put up and have the bushes cut back.  
Internally, we need to look at the car park layout, put up new signage and mark out  
the lines for the car park again, make the traffic flow simpler. It may also help to take  
some of the weight of cars away from the car park by providing a ‘park and ride’ bus  
to another car park, or a bus to the city centre or rail station; it might mean better  
signposting of the exits or staggering the finishing of different parts of the events to  
reduce the rush for the gates. The solutions that get the most management attention  
should be those that will have most impact on the problem, and then moving down  
the list of solutions to those that have respectively less but still positive effects. In  
the above example, we have supposed it has been identified only at the end, but  
monitoring should be going on during events, and where it takes place over more  
than one day, some urgent changes could be made once the event closes for the day,  
or overnight, or even during the event.  
The costs of some problems and service failures may be hidden, perhaps because  
they deal with visitor satisfaction and enjoyment, or are not terribly obvious in  
some way. These costs might involve a hidden loss of revenue; the distraction of  
event managers from key activities whilst solving problems; time taken in dealing  
with complaints because the service was inadequate, and so on. Consequently, the  
issue related to identifying the problems is to be able to identify satisfaction with  
events. In simple terms, people might have enjoyed the event, despite the problems  
they encountered, or alternatively, these irritations might have spoilt their expe-  
rience altogether. We can make an event look pretty, have fancy marketing, have  
standardised management systems, provide smart uniforms, but if the event itself  
is no good, and our guests have not enjoyed themselves, all these mechanisms will  
not have enhanced guests’ impressions of the event or guests’ experience of it. You  
can go to see a play in a clean and well–kept theatre, with polite and efficient box  
office staff, prompt service at the bar during the interval and in company of good  
friends, but the play might still have been lousy. This is also true of events. What,  
then, affects people’s impressions?  
There is a view that visitors’ impressions of an event are influenced by two sets of  
judgements, based on aspects of an event that satisfy them, and those that dissatisfy  
them. Things that work as satisfiers are the ambience, excitement, social involvement,  
relaxation and other positive emotional states, together with some service elements.  
Things that work as dissatisfiers tend to be physical and basic service features, such  
as the parking, the toilets, availability of information, queues, etc. In analysing sat-  
isfaction levels using this approach, a formal method of research is needed, based  
on both questionnaires about the service quality features of an event as well as  
observations by trained observers. This kind of research could be done by a market  
research agency, but should result in the analysis of visitors’ perceptions of the event  
and identification of those factors that were satisfiers, and were thus critical to its  
success; and those that were dissatisfiers and thus critical failure points.

• Music festival scheduled for two weekends in April and May 2017  
• To be held on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma  
• Targeted at a wealthy and celebrity audience  
• Resulted in the arrest and prosecution of the event organiser  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the context of ethical behaviour in events management,  
with the following objectives\:  
• To examine the effect of unethical behaviour in terms of outcomes for the public and event  
attendees, reputation of the events organiser or events organisation and the impacts and  
importance of corporate social and ethical responsibility in general.  
• To highlight how feedback during the various stages of an event might impact the success, fail-  
ure and reputation of an event and its organisers.  
• To consider the nature of evaluation in terms of framing future behaviours and decision-making  
for events organisers.  
**T**he Fyre Festival was perhaps one of the most  
famously shambolic, disorganised and scan-  
dalous events of its time. Some writers regard it as  
having been a choice example of everything which  
can go wrong at an event, led by an event organiser  
whose skills were considered to be totally inade-  
quate to the task and whose unethical behaviour  
resulted in his arrest and prosecution.

festival in the setting of a lovely Caribbean island  
where festival-goers could, in the words of the fes-  
tival’s website, make ‘your desires . . . our inspira-  
tion’. The outcome satisfied no-one’s desires and  
inspiration appeared to stretch no further than fleec-  
ing festival-goers for large amounts of their money.  
Tickets for the festival ranged from €1,250 includ-  
ing attendance, accommodation and flights to an  
astonishing €30,000 for an ‘experience’ involving a  
luxury yacht, attendance, accommodation and ser-  
vices on the yacht, food and crew. This for one week-  
end. The event was promoted on social media by  
‘influencers’ i.e. celebrity models and people with a lot  
of followers on platforms such as Instagram. However,  
it later transpired that they had been paid to big up  
the Fyre Festival and that such behaviour \(being paid  
to big something up and not say you were paid\) was  
illegal\: resulting in calls for their prosecution and calling  
into question the ethics of people who think it accept-  
able to lie having been paid. It is not acceptable to lie.  
In terms of evaluation, had the event organiser him-  
self had any ethical or indeed organisation concepts  
it would have become immediately clear to him that  
the event would fail. It appeared that he had no events  
background, no experience and not enough relevant  
knowledge which unfortunately seems a recurring  
problem. Tassiopoulos and Nicolaides \(2017\) in a  
thoughtful article about ethics in the event industry,  
mentions this exact problem, people wandering in  
to the industry without any professional background.  
Feedback almost at the very start of the event process  
had called the success of the Fyre Festival into ques-  
tion. Quite simply, one should not start a process with-  
out an understanding of how to do it, whether the event  
is feasible or appropriate and one should not continue  
with an event when it is clear that you don’t know what  
you are doing. These basic tenets were not known or  
understood at the Fyre Festival and the event organiser  
and his organising team ploughed on with the event  
until the first day, allegedly trying to pay off a loan for  
putting the event on by continuing to sell tickets.  
On the first day of the event, the 27th of April  
­ festival-goers began arriving at the airport at Exuma.  
Those who reached the festival ground found an  
unfinished and unready site, none of the glories they  
expected for their hugely expensive tickets, no charm-  
ing beach-side chalets or yachts, just wet tents, wet  
mattresses, nowhere to sleep, a few portaloos, almost  
no food, no water, and three showers for a supposed  
5000 attendees. In the evening one local band played  
for a few hours and then went home. Famously, what  
little food was made available bore none of the prom-  
ised deluxe upmarket delights made by world famous  
chefs, but consisted of a plastic box with a cheese  
sandwich in it. The picture of the cheese sandwich  
duly did the rounds internationally on social media as  
the disaster, more correctly the vast incompetence, of  
the Fyre Festival became apparent.  
The Fyre Festival was not the sole example of  
festival failure that year. A festival took place in  
Liverpool, England, the ‘Hope and Glory Festival’  
in August which also exhibited a range of serious  
organisational and safety issues and which was  
closed down almost as fast as it had been opened,  
with many in the media and in the city calling it a  
shambles and a ‘car crash’ of a festival  
# Discussion Questions  
**1** Select a suitable news article about the Fyre  
Festival during its development or staging \(not  
afterwards\). Was it apparent from this article that  
the event would be disastrous and if so how?  
**2** Do ethical issues for events always emerge under  
public scrutiny or via evaluation or social media  
feedback and how should genuine events organ-  
isers and managers react to such feedback?  
**3** Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility  
are key issues, so how can events organising  
companies, those involved in events and oth-  
ers, such as professional bodies, ensure that  
an ethical approach is taken and that such an  
approach is responsible and adhered to?  
**4** Consider the differences, problems and serious  
issues which emerge from comparing the Fyre  
Festival and the Hope and Glory Festival as pre-  
sented by national, local or social media.

It is important to recognise the limitations of what can be achieved in evaluating  
events. We are never going to achieve complete and total satisfaction for 100% of  
our visitors and participants\: everyone’s needs and expectations vary. There will be,  
in the human nature of events, many factors that impinge on people’s perception,  
even though we might go to considerable lengths to identify and deal with the criti-  
cal incidents. Paying close attention to incoming feedback throughout the stages of  
an event allows us to identify issues as they arise and, in some cases allow others to  
identify serious, ethical or critical issues which may impact not only on our individual  
events and their success, but also on our reputation as an event organiser, even to  
the extent where such issues might have a major impact on our corporate social and  
ethical responsibilities.  
# Divestment and leGAcies  
Many events are repeat editions, others are not. Some events are designed for a  
single ‘one-time-only’ purpose; some do not normally recur in the same place twice,  
even though they may leave substantial legacies in terms of buildings and facilities  
\(Bladen et al., 2018\); some events leave only social legacies. Many events leave no  
legacy except happiness and do not need to do any more than that.  
If the event has been a one-off, with regeneration or reuse in mind as objectives  
for the site, the divestment needs to be planned into the process at the beginning.  
There will be a target date for the handover to the site’s new owners or manag-  
ers, and the site must be given over in the condition that the original objectives  
intended, or that the plans specified \(unless this is done properly, financial or other  
penalties may be incurred in order to put things right\). It will be essential to hand  
over not just the site, but also the knowledge that goes with it, about its nature,  
utilities, environment, problems and limitations. Consequently, a handover may  
not simply be a case of saying, ‘Here are the keys,’ before leaping into your Ferrari  
and driving away.  
There should be a period of overlap between the event organisation closing down  
and departing, and the redevelopment organisation, agency or new owners starting  
work. In some cases, this may even mean the continuance of certain jobs or roles  
between the two organisations, perhaps for posts such as site manager or marketing  
officer. This will improve the transfer of important information between the organ-  
isations concerned. Copies of important documentation will also be handed over,  
including copies of the final reports and the events history file \(in case parts of the  
event occur again or certain suppliers need to be contacted\). In some cases, a for-  
mal handover ceremony may take place, with the media being present, to stress the  
change in the site’s circumstances.  
The type of post-event use of an event site, where regeneration or reuse has been  
planned, may vary, as may the kind of organisation taking over the site. In the case  
of the event sites such as the Millennium Dome site and parts of the Hanover Expo  
site, development companies were allowed to purchase these with various projects  
in mind\: in the case of the Dome, to eventually create the O2 Arena; in the case of  
parts of the Hanover site to create residential housing, an aspect that was planned at  
the beginning as a method of reuse of exhibitors’ accommodation.  
Reuse varies according to what facilities were provided for the event. The Com-  
monwealth Games site in Manchester was reused primarily for sporting and leisure  
facilities. The objectives for the Hanover site stressed ecological sustainability, thus

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it. The life expiry of events  
the Expo was intended to make use of existing on-site exhibition facilities rather than  
create new ones. For smaller-scale events, reuse may not actually imply any new use  
or a transfer of ownership. Where an event recurs year after year, the site may simply  
have to be restored to its normal condition, such as parkland or a public venue of  
some kind. The effort in these cases is mainly one of restoration and maintenance  
rather than any form of rebuilding.  
The legacies of many kinds of events may not be conceived in physical terms,  
some being long-term, others indirect or subtle in their outcomes \(Getz and Page,  
2016\). Event-based regeneration activities are usually regarded as physical and eco-  
nomic, for example, transforming a derelict area into something usable, but this  
is outside the scope of most events. The impacts of an event whose aims are not  
targeted at reuse or some economic purpose are probably much more limited and  
social. They may be intended to improve the image of an area, or to sustain tourism  
by increasing awareness of a destination, or they may simply be to enhance social  
integration and improve the confidence of a community in itself. These social aims  
may be more than worthwhile, and may have more positive outcomes for a com-  
munity than any physical legacies. It depends on what the event objectives were.  
Lundberg et al. \(2017\), amongst others, considers economic outcomes and various  
means of evaluation.  
# 299  
# The life expiry of events  
We have said that the range of events, from small personal ones to large commer-  
cial or sporting events is vast. Many events are single one-time activities but lots  
of events \(annual festivals, carnivals, local traditional and folklore events, fetes,  
shows, annual markets and sports days, exhibitions and pageants\) are repeated  
year after year. Not all annual events go on forever. Some events that run every year  
for many years may simply end because the key organising person or prime mover  
dies, retires and is not replaced, or tires of the constant effort. Even where an event  
has a tremendous tradition behind it, this is no guarantee of its survival over the  
longer term. The world changes, local circumstances and people change and what  
might once have been a great and popular event ceases to take place. In some cases  
the reasons why an event ceases or fails are not well understood. There may indeed  
be obvious reasons such as the loss of a key venue, the lack of money, the lack of  
people or volunteers to put the event on, the lack of resources such as equipment or  
the loss of a crucial sponsor.  
There may, though, be less obvious reasons. The long-term decline of an event  
over several years may be due to a complicated series of factors which are only  
vaguely understood, such as a decline in attendance due to changing social attitudes  
or different age groups being attracted to other things. There may be a combina-  
tion of factors ranging from poor organisation or poor marketing to the combined  
effect of bad weather or competition over several years, or perhaps the loss of focus  
or loss of understanding by the organisers of the objective in running the event. In  
some cases where this happens the event organisers or an organising committee  
may simply not understand why the event is failing or in decline, but may realise  
that the event cannot, even with goodwill, continue. Very often the only certain  
indication of the decline of an event may be increasing financial losses which either  
quickly, or eventually, cannot be sustained and reach a point where this problem is  
insurmountable.

event. Manchester had prepared well, though,  
and the local community took an active inter-  
est  
–  
it was quickly hailed as the most important  
multi-sport event Britain had seen since the 1948  
Olympics.  
An intention to provide a lasting legacy from  
the Games, for Manchester and the North-west of  
England, had been an explicit objective from the bid-  
ding stage, which had three themes\:  
• ensuring the whole region benefited from host-  
ing the Games  
• ensuring that disadvantaged communities  
were, and felt, involved  
• ensuring that businesses in the region bene-  
fited from the activity generated by the Games  
and its potential spin-offs.  
To this end, the ‘Commonwealth Games Oppor-  
tunity and Legacy Partnership’ was established  
three years prior to the event itself, bringing together  
such key agencies as the North West Arts Board  
and Sport England North West.  
Following the XVII Games, some €103 million  
was quickly committed to Sportcity, in addition  
to the Games being a catalyst for a number of  
major physical improvements; including Picca-  
dilly Plaza and Gardens, and the Ancoats Urban  
Village  
–  
plus a number of other developments  
across the region, including the €24.75 million  
investment of the Economic and Social Legacy  
programme. The regeneration of East Manchester  
was a key objective of Manchester City Council  
and of the development of Sportcity. With the City  
of Manchester Stadium  
–  
now converted to the  
new home of Manchester City football club  
–  
as  
its centrepiece, it was seen as critical to the area’s  
regeneration strategy.  
The volunteer programme was also seen as a  
great success and workshops were held to both  
confirm accreditation for this experience and to  
encourage individuals to build upon it; helping to  
provide a pool of volunteers for the region to draw  
upon  
–  
including the 10,500 unsuccessful applicants  
which boosted the Post Games Volunteer Project to  
some 22,000 people.  
The Games benefited from being able to use  
legacy venues from previous initiatives and event  
bids, such as the Manchester Evening News Arena  
\(Europe’s largest multi-purpose indoor entertain-  
ment and sports arena\) and the Manchester Velo-  
drome \(developed as a joint venture between the  
English Sports Council, Manchester City Council  
and the British Cycling Federation\). It remains to be  
seen whether the event helped to restore England’s  
image as a venue for top-flight events, given the  
debacles of the Millennium Dome, Wembley Sta-  
dium and the Picket’s Lock athletics stadium sham-  
bles, this reputation had to be restored if bids to hold  
the Olympic Games and the World Cup in England  
were to be treated seriously. The games were held  
at the Gold Coast in 2018 and are scheduled for  
Birmingham in 2022.

FACTBOX  
• The Royal Agricultural Show  
• An annual event from 1839  
• At its peak attracted 250,000 visitors  
• Final event in 2009  
# Learning Objectives  
The aim of this case study is to examine the death of an event  
with the following objectives\:  
• To consider how a well-established event might decline.  
• To highlight why decline might be both terminal and inevitable in terms of the changing world in  
which an event takes place or took place.  
• To examine whether there are any mechanisms to manage the decline of an event.  
**T**he Royal Agricultural Show was first held  
by the Royal Agricultural Society of England  
in 1839. Its purpose was to promote the adop-  
tion of new and scientific ideas for the better-  
ment of farming. For over 100 years the show  
rotated around the country with towns and cities  
competing for the prestige of holding it. As the  
industrial revolution progressed the show grew in  
size and range of exhibits. Originally it just showed  
livestock such as prize cattle and sheep, then  
expanded into new agricultural machinery \(in the  
Victorian age there were steam machinery trials of  
threshing-­ machines and other steam driven farm  
equipment\).

# 303  
The show was a four-day event, so exhibitors  
had to be present all four days in addition to the  
setting up days. Typically visiting farmers and land-  
owners attended for the first two days and the public  
attended for the last two days, and this included  
visiting schoolchildren for their education in farming  
and countryside activities. Many children in cities  
had never seen a cow or a sheep.  
In 1963 the show settled at a then new  
600-­ hectare showground at Stoneleigh Park in cen-  
tral England and remained there until its final year  
in 2009. In 1963 it attracted 120,000 people and  
it continued to grow through the 1970s and 1980s  
when nearly 250,000 people a year would visit. A  
film made by the BBC in 1989 shows huge crowds  
in a year when over 220,000 attended, including the  
Queen and the Prime Minister.  
The show continued through the 1990s but a  
gradual decline had set in caused by a wide range  
of reasons. Firstly, the farming industry was itself in  
decline and the number of farmers falling. By 2000  
this decline of the show had become more obvi-  
ous and its focus had changed from trying to con-  
centrate on farming to trying to attract the public.  
To this end, in addition to the livestock and farm  
equipment on show there were horse trials and a  
vast shopping area with over 100 stands selling  
everything from clothes, furniture, and jewellery to  
overseas holidays.  
Matters, however, became gradually worse and  
in 2001 and 2007 there were animal disease prob-  
lems such as Foot-and-Mouth and Bluetongue  
which reduced the number of livestock on display.  
In 2004, 2007 and 2008 torrential rain turned the  
showground into a mud bath. In addition to these  
incidental problems and the structural decline in  
farming, the organisers were criticised for a whole  
range of issues including poor publicity, insufficient  
organisation and pointless changes in the layout of  
the showground, resulting in confusion about how  
to find things and appointing an Event Manage-  
ment Company which made the problems worse  
not better. So much so that in 2005 there were  
queues of 30 minutes duration of people waiting  
to complain about the event at the organisers’  
office\: all this and the lack of focus on what the  
show was for. One year the organisers would pro-  
mote the event as a public attraction, the next  
year they would change their minds and try to get  
more farmers to attend and actively discourage  
the public.  
When the end came the Royal Agricultural Soci-  
ety said it was due to the event not being financially  
viable. The animal diseases and the bad weather  
were also claimed to be contributory reasons.  
However, farmers and farmers’ representatives  
were clearer, and much discussion appeared on  
farming websites and blogs. In their opinion the  
Royal Show had ceased to do what they needed  
it to do, although they were nostalgic, even sorry  
to see it close. But, if they wanted to undertake  
farming business, develop new contacts or buy a  
new tractor they could go to other shows\: and also  
the big equipment exhibitors no longer went to the  
Royal Show. The Tenant Farmers’ Association said  
simply that their members had better things to do  
than spend four days at the event, there wasn’t the  
time anymore and the show had lost its farming  
focus.  
The reasons why a long standing or formerly  
popular event may fail do vary and there may be  
lessons to be drawn from brand failure in other  
industries such as food or retailing, as well as hos-  
pitality, tourism and events. For a further example,  
the Peace & Love Music Festival was the hallmark  
event of the Swedish city of Borlänge. In 2013, the  
Festival organisation declared itself bankrupt and  
its failure was thought to be for three contributory  
reasons \(Nordvall, 2017\); firstly, that its organisa-  
tion was vulnerable; secondly, that it found itself  
up against a strong new competitor and thirdly  
because of uncertainty amongst its visitors and fes-  
tival goers, who felt that the new competitor might  
be ‘the place to be’.

**1** In terms of reasons for the closure of this  
show, what were the real reasons and what  
were the symptoms?

so, what reasons were given?  
events’ decline evaluation and assessment?  
Can a declining event be saved and if so why?

We cannot easily say that the decision to close an event will be an easy one even  
where it is an obvious one. Many events, especially those run by volunteers, have a  
huge weight of commitment behind them, tremendous goodwill, and perhaps a long  
history or tradition. Nevertheless, events cannot be sustained just because of these  
reasons, and a decision to cease running an event might be best taken by evaluating  
carefully all the factors which bear on its operation, before a financial loss becomes  
a burden to the organisers. The decline or closure of an event may need to be prop-  
erly managed, the more so if an event is part of a programme of combined events of  
some kind, such as a series of different events put on in a town or city as part of its  
effort to attract tourists and visitors. Indeed, each year the whole sequence of such a  
programme might have to be evaluated to see if all the events are to be kept, or some  
replaced, or some changed in order to safeguard the whole.

# Summary  
**E**vent close-down is one of those aspects of management that  
receives insufficient attention, as the temptation is to get cleared up  
and finished as soon as possible. But this can be a recipe for disaster, or  
at least for accidents. The large number of people milling round, moving  
heavy items or trying to get out of the venue in a hurry has to be overseen  
and reasonable control achieved. Once close-down is over, and the event  
team has had time to sit back and reflect; the opportunity should be taken  
to evaluate and to learn for the future. For repeat events, this process is  
both necessary and important to running a better event, or one at least  
as good, in the future. For some repeat events a decline in attendance or  
financial viability, perhaps over several years, may result in their termination.  
For one-off events, there are still lessons that the team or individual can  
learn for their own benefit, and the evaluation process might also have  
to feed into some closing report or event history file, so that information  
should be collected and analysed to help wrap up loose ends. Event  
feedback is, however, not just an end-of-event activity, you do receive  
feedback both personally and through social media as events start and  
progress, this feedback should be monitored and adjustments made, as  
well as noting developing issues\: because what appears to be a small  
issue might blow up into a big one, it might have ethical implications or  
outcomes which are important to your organisation’s reputation or its sense  
of corporate social responsibility. Handling this badly can destroy your  
organisation in the eyes of the public or result in career change for yourself.  
Finally, events may leave a legacy. This may be in personal memories  
or friendly social contacts made at the event, or it may be in some item  
handed over  
–  
anything from a park bench, bought from the modest  
surplus of the village fête, the donation for an honourable or charitable  
cause, to the grand arena built to regenerate a city. It may be transient or  
long-lasting. Either way, some thought should be given at the beginning  
to the setting of objectives for any legacy if that is going to be a matter for  
the event.  
If we have a final word it is this\: there is a tendency to believe that  
events should be bigger, better, louder, more impressive or more  
profitable than their previous editions or their competitor events, and  
many pressures are exerted by commercial interests and the media to do  
this\: but it is not so. Neither size alone, nor profit, nor vastness of noise  
should blind us to the true purpose of events  
–  
that of enjoyment, gentle  
pleasures, social well-being and a general and public affection and respect  
for those around us.

# Evaluation questions  
**1** What issues might be involved in closing down  
an event?  
**2** How are events evaluated and why, how can you  
obtain participant and visitor feedback?  
**3** What potential post-event uses are there  
of unique event sites? Could these uses be  
planned at the beginning, that is, could they be  
an outcome of putting the event on?  
**4** Why might an event decline or even close  
­ immediately after the previous edition?
