Index 333 Preface to the Second Edition  
**W**hen I first considered publishing an update to the first edition  
ofmybookINSPIRED,IestimatedthatmaybeIwouldmodify  
somethinglike10–20percentofthecontent.That’sbecausetherewas  
very little of the first edition that I wished I could change.  
However, once I got started, I quickly realized that this second  
editionwouldrequireacompleterewrite.NotbecauseIregrettedwhat  
Ihadwritten,butbecauseIbelieveIhavemuchbetterwaysofexplain-  
ing these topics now.  
I had no idea that the first edition would be as successful as it  
has been. Thanks to the book, I have made friends all over the globe.  
Thebookhasbeentranslatedintoseverallanguages,anddespitebeing  
nearly 10 years old as of this writing, sales continues to grow, all by  
word of mouth and reviews.  
So, if you have read the first edition, I thank you, and hope you  
enjoythesecondeditionevenmore.IfyouarenewtoINSPIRED,Iam  
hoping this new edition accomplishes its objective even better.  
WhenIwrotethefirstedition,itwasbeforeAgilewaswellestab-  
lished in product companies, and before Customer Development and  
Lean Startup nomenclature became popularized. Today, most teams  
have been using these techniques for several years and are more inter-  
ested in what’s beyond Lean and Agile, which is what I focus on here.  
I have kept the basic structure of the book intact, but the tech-  
niques I describe have improved significantly over the past decade.  
BeyondchanginghowIexplainthetopicsandupdatingthetech-  
niques,theothermajorchangetothebookisthatInowgointodetail  
on what I refer to here as Product @ Scale.  
**xvii** **xviii** PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION  
In the first edition, I focused more on startups. In this edition,  
however, I wanted to expand the scope to look at the challenges of  
growth-stage companies and how product can be done well at large,  
enterprise companies.  
There’s no question that scale introduces serious challenges, and  
over the past decade, much of my time has been spent coaching com-  
paniesthroughrapidgrowth.Sometimeswecallthatsurvivingsuccess,  
if that gives you an indication of how hard it can be.  
I’ve received a lot of great feedback from readers of the first  
edition, and there are a couple of important things I’ve learned that I  
would like to address here.  
First, there really is a critical need to focus on the specific job of  
the product manager. In the first edition, I talked a lot about prod-  
uct management, but I tried to speak to product teams more broadly.  
Today, there are many excellent resources for product designers and  
engineers, but precious little available specifically for product managers  
who are responsiblefor technology-powered products. So, in this edition  
Idecidedtoconcentrateonthejobofthetechnologyproductmanager.  
Ifyouareaproductmanageratatechnologycompany,orifyouaspire  
to be one, I am hoping this will become your go-to resource.  
Second, there are many people looking for a recipe for product  
success—a prescriptive guide or framework to how to create products  
customerslove.WhileIunderstandthedesire,andIknowI’dlikelysell  
many more copies if I positioned this book that way, the unfortunate  
truth is that’s just not how great products are created. It is much more  
aboutcreatingtherightproductcultureforsuccess,andunderstanding  
the array of product discovery and delivery techniques so that you can  
use the right tool for the specific issue you are facing. And, yes, this  
meansthatthejoboftheproductmanagerisnotinanysenseeasy,and  
truth be told, not everyone is equipped to succeed in this job.  
All that said, the tech product management job is today one of  
the most desired jobs in our industry, and is the leading source—the  
provingground—ofstartupCEOs.So,ifyou’vegotthedesireandare  
willing to put in the effort, I’d like nothing better than to help you  
succeed. **PART**

# Lessons from Top Tech  
# Companies  
**I**n the mid-1980s, I was a young software engineer working for  
Hewlett Packard on a high-profile product. It was a time \(the first  
time\) when artificial intelligence was all the rage, and I was fortunate  
enough to be working at what was then one of the industry’s best  
technology companies, as part of a very strong software engineering  
team \(several members of that team went on to substantial success in  
companies across the industry\).  
Our assignment was a difficult one\: to deliver AI-enabling tech-  
nology on a low-cost, general-purpose workstation that, until then,  
required a special-purpose hardware/software combination that cost  
more than \$100,000 per user—a price few could afford.  
We worked long and hard for well over a year, sacrificing count-  
less nights and weekends. Along the way, we added several patents  
to HP’s portfolio. We developed the software to meet HP’s exacting  
quality standards. We internationalized the product and localized it  
**1** **2** INSPIRED  
for several languages. We trained the sales force. We previewed our  
technology with the press and received excellent reviews. We were  
ready. We released. We celebrated the release.  
Just one problem\: No one bought it.  
The product was a complete failure in the marketplace. Yes, it  
was technically impressive, and the reviewers loved it, but it wasn’t  
something people wanted or needed.  
The team was of course extremely frustrated with this outcome.  
But soon we began to ask ourselves some very important questions\:  
Who decides what products we should build? How do they decide?  
How do they know that what we build will be useful?  
Our young team learned something very profound—something  
many teams have discovered the hard way\: It doesn’t matter how good  
your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to  
build.  
When trying to track down the root cause of our failure, I  
learned that the decisions about what to build came from a product  
manager—someone who generally resided in the marketing organiza-  
tion and who was responsible for defining the products we built. But  
I also learned that product management wasn’t something HP was  
particularly good at. I later learned that most companies weren’t good  
at this either, and, in fact, most still aren’t.  
I promised myself that never again would I work so hard on a  
product unless I knew the product would be something that users and  
customers wanted.  
Over the next 30 years, I have had the very good fortune to work  
onsomeofthemostsuccessfulhigh-techproductsofourtime—firstat  
HPduringtheriseofpersonalcomputers;thenatNetscapeCommuni-  
cationsduringtheriseoftheInternet,whereIworkedasvicepresident  
of platform and tools; later at eBay during the rise of e-commerce and  
marketplaces,whereIservedastheseniorvicepresidentofproductand  
design; and then as an adviser to startups working with many of what  
have become today’s most successful technology product companies.  
Not every product effort has been as successful as others, but I  
amhappytosaythatnonewerefailures,andseveralbecamelovedand  
used by millions of people around the world.  
Soon after I left eBay, I started getting calls from product orga-

between how the best  
how the best companies produced  
products and how most companies  
produced them.  
I realized that the state of the  
art was very different from the state of  
the practice.  
Most companies were still using old and inefficient ways to dis-  
cover and deliver products. I also learned that there was precious little  
helpavailable,eitherfromacademia,includingthebestbusinessschool  
programs, or from industry organizations, which seemed hopelessly  
stuck in the failed models of the past—just like the one I worked in  
at HP.  
I have had some great rides, and I am especially thankful that I  
have had the chance to work for and with some of the best product  
mindsintheindustry.Thebestideasinthisbookarefromthesepeople.  
You will find a list of many of them in the acknowledgments. I have  
learned from them all, and I am grateful to each one of them.

tomers love—products that inspire and provide real value. I find that  
mostproductleadersalsowanttocreateinspiringandsuccessfulprod-  
ucts. But most products are not inspiring, and life is too short for bad  
products.  
My hope in writing this book is that it will help share the best  
practices of the most successful product companies and that the result  
will be truly inspiring products—products that customers love. **CHAPTER**  
# 1  
# Behind Every Great Product  
**I**t is my strong belief, and the central concept driving this book, that  
behind every great product there is someone—usually someone  
behind the scenes, working tirelessly—who led the product team to  
combine technology and design to solve real customer problems in a  
way that met the needs of the business.  
These people usually have the title product manager, but they  
might be a startup co-founder or CEO, or they might be someone in  
another role on the team who stepped up because they saw the need.  
Further, this product management role is very distinct from the  
design, engineering, marketing, or project manager roles.  
This book is intended for these people.  
Within modern technology product teams, the product manager  
has some very specific and very challenging responsibilities. It’s a  
tremendously difficult job, and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise  
is not doing you any favors.  
**5** **6** INSPIRED  
The product manager role  
is usually very much a full-time  
assignment.Idon’tpersonallyknow  
many who are able to do what they  
need to do in less than 60 hours  
a week.  
It’s great if you’re a designer  
or an engineer who also wants to  
serve as a product manager—there  
are some real advantages to that.  
But you’ll find out pretty quickly  
that you’re taking on an immense  
amount of work. If you’re up for  
that, however, the results can be  
It is my strong belief, and  
the central concept driving  
this book, that behind every  
great product there is  
someone—usually someone

tirelessly—who led the

impressive.  
A product team is comprised of at least a product manager and  
usually somewhere between 2 and 10 engineers. If you’re creating a  
user-facing product, you would expect to have a product designer on

**T**here are many kinds of products out there, but in this book, I  
concentrate exclusively on products that are powered by technology.  
Some of what we explore in this book may help you if you’re

My focus is on the unique issues and challenges associated with  
building technology-powered products, services, and experiences.  
Some good examples of the sweet spot that we explore are  
consumer-service products, such as e-commerce sites or marketplaces  
\(e.g.,Netflix,Airbnb,orEtsy\),socialmedia\(e.g.,Facebook,LinkedIn,  
or Twitter\), business services \(e.g., Salesforce.com, Workday, or

It’s my belief that most products today are transforming into  
technology-powered products, and the companies that don’t realize this  
are rapidly being disrupted. But, again, I’m only focused here on  
technology-powered products, and those companies that believe they  
must embrace technology and consistently innovate on behalf of their  
customers. **CHAPTER**

# Startups\: Getting to  
# Product/Marketing Fit  
**I**nthetechnologyworld,wegenerallyhavethreestagesofcompanies\:  
startups, growth-stage, and enterprise companies. Let’s briefly con-  
sider how we characterize each one of these stages, and the challenges  
you are likely to face in each.  
I loosely define startup as a new product company that has yet to  
achieve product/market fit. Product/market fit is an extremely impor-  
tant concept that I’ll define in the pages that follow, but for now, let’s  
just say that the startup is still trying to come up with a product that  
can power a viable business.  
Inastartup,theproductmanagerroleisusuallycoveredbyoneof  
theco-founders.Typically,therearefewerthan25engineers,covering  
a range of from one product team up to maybe four or five.  
The reality of startup life is that you’re in a race to achieve  
product/market fit before you run out of money. Nothing else much  
matters until you can come up with a strong product that meets the  
**9** **10** INSPIRED  
needs of an initial market, so most of the focus of the young company  
is necessarily on the product.  
Startupsusuallyhavealimitedamountofearlyfunding,intended  
to determine if the company can discover and deliver the necessary  
product. The closer you come to running out of money, the more  
frantic the pace and the more desperate the team and the leadership  
becomes.  
While money and time are typically tight, good startups are  
optimized to learn and move quickly, and there’s normally very little  
bureaucracy to slow them down. Yet the very high failure rate of  
technology startups is no secret. The few that succeed are usually  
those that are really good at product discovery, which is a major topic  
of this book.  
Working at a startup—racing  
toward product/market fit—is usu-  
ally stressful, exhausting, and risky.  
But it can also be an amazingly  
positive experience, and if things  
go well, a financially rewarding  
one too.  
Nothing else much matters  
until you can come up with  
a strong product that meets  
the needs of an initial  
market. **CHAPTER**

# Growth-Stage Companies\:  
# Scaling to Success  
**T**hose startups skilled and fortunate enough \(it usually takes both\)  
to get to product/market fit are ready to tackle another equally  
difficult challenge\: how to effectively grow and scale.  
There are many very significant challenges involved in growing  
and scaling a startup into a large, successful business. While it’s an  
extremely difficult challenge, it is, as we say, a good problem to have.

to replicate our earlier successes with new, adjacent products and ser-  
vices. At the same time, we need to grow the core business as fast as  
possible.  
In growth stage, we typically have somewhere between about 25  
andseveralhundredengineers,sotherearemanymorepeoplearound  
to help, but the signs of organizational stress are everywhere.  
Product teams complain that they don’t understand the big  
picture—they don’t see how their work contributes to the larger

goals, and they’re struggling with  
what it means to be an empowered,

Sales and marketing often  
complain that the go-to-market

strategies that worked for the first  
product are not so appropriate for some of the new products in  
the portfolio.  
Thetechnologyinfrastructurethatwascreatedtomeettheneeds  
of the initial product is often bursting at the seams, and you start to  
hear the term “technical debt” from every engineer you speak with.  
This stage is also tough on leaders because the leadership style  
and mechanisms that worked while the company was a young startup  
oftenfailtoscale.Leadersareforcedtochangetheirrolesand,inmany  
cases, their behaviors.  
But the motivation to overcome these challenges is very strong.  
The company is often in pursuit of a public offering or, perhaps,  
becoming a major business unit of an existing company. As well as the  
very real possibility of having a significant and positive impact on the  
world can be very motivating. **CHAPTER**

# Enterprise Companies\:  
# Consistent Product  
# Innovation  
**F**or those companies that succeed in scaling and that want to create  
a lasting business, some of the toughest challenges still lie ahead.  
Strong tech-product companies know they need to ensure  
consistent product innovation. This means constantly creating new  
valuefortheircustomersandfortheirbusiness.Notjusttweakingand  
optimizing existing products \(referred to as value capture\) but, rather,  
developing each product to reach its full potential.  
Yet, many large, enterprise companies have already embarked on  
a slow death spiral. They become all about leveraging the value and  
the brand that was created many years or even decades earlier. The  
death of an enterprise company rarely happens overnight, and a large  
companycanstayafloatformanyyears.But,makenomistakeaboutit,  
the organization is sinking, and the end state is all but certain.

It’s not intentional, of course,  
but once companies reach this

holders throughout the business  
workinghardtoprotectwhatthecompanyhascreated.Unfortunately,  
this often means shutting down new initiatives or ventures that could  
re-createthebusiness\(butpotentiallyputthecorebusinessatrisk\),or  
putting up so many obstacles to new ideas that few people are willing  
or able to drive the company in a new direction.  
The symptoms of this are hard to miss, starting with diminished  
morale, the lack of innovation, and how much slower it is for new  
product work to get into the hands of customers.  
When the company was young, it likely had a clear and com-  
pelling vision. When it achieves enterprise stage, however, the  
company has largely achieved that original vision and now people  
aren’t sure what’s next. Product teams complain about the lack of  
vision, lack of empowerment, the fact that it takes forever to get a  
decisionmade,andproductworkisturningintodesignbycommittee.  
Leadership is likely frustrated, too, with the lack of innovation  
from the product teams. All too often, they resort to acquisitions or  
creating separate “innovation centers” to incubate new businesses in a

# The Root Causes of Failed  
# Product Efforts  
**L**et’s start by exploring the root causes of why so many product  
efforts fail.  
I see the same basic way of working at the vast majority of com-  
panies, of every size, in every corner of the globe, and I can’t help but  
notice that this is not close to how the best companies actually work.  
Let me warn you that this discussion can be a little depressing,  
especiallyifithitstooclosetohome,soifthat’sthecase,I’llaskyouto  
hang in there with me.  
Figure 6.1 describes the process that most companies still use to  
createproducts.I’lltrynottoeditorializeyet—letmefirstjustdescribe  
the process\:  
As you can see, everything starts with ideas. In most companies,  
they’recomingfrominside\(executivesorkeystakeholdersorbusiness  
owners\) or outside \(current or prospective customers\). Wherever the  
ideasoriginate,therearealwaysawholebunchofthingsthatdifferent

Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts  
Now, most companies want to prioritize those ideas into a  
roadmap, and they do this for two main reasons. First, they want us to  
work on the most important things first, and second, they want to be  
able to predict when things will be ready.  
To accomplish this, there is usually some form of quarterly or  
annual planning session in which the leaders consider the ideas and  
negotiateaproductroadmap.Butinordertoprioritize,theyfirstneed  
some form of a businesscasefor each item.  
Somecompaniesdoformalbusinesscases,andsomeareinformal,

idea\: \(1\) How much money or value will it make? and \(2\) How much  
money or time will it cost? This information is then used to come up  
withtheroadmap,usuallyforthenextquarter,butsometimesasmuch  
as a year out.  
At this point, the product and technology organization has its  
marching orders, and they typically work the items from the highest  
priority on down.  
Once an idea makes it to the top of the list, the first thing that’s  
done is for a product manager to talk to the stakeholders to flesh out  
the idea and to come up with a set of “requirements.”  
These requirements might be user stories, or they might be  
more like some form of a functional specification. Their purpose  
is to communicate with the designers and engineers what needs to  
be built.  
Once the requirements are gathered up, the userexperiencedesign  
team \(assuming the company has such a team\), is asked to provide the The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts **17**  
interaction design, the visual design, and, in cases of physical devices,  
the industrial design.  
Finally, the requirements and design specs make it to engineers.  
This is usually where Agile finally enters the picture.  
Anyway, the engineers will typically break up the work into a set  
of iterations—called “sprints” in the Scrum process. So maybe it takes  
one to three sprints to build out the idea.  
Hopefully the QA testing is part of those sprints, but if not, the  
QA team will follow this up with some testing to make sure the new  
ideaworksasadvertisedanddoesn’tintroduceotherproblems\(known  
as regressions\).  
Once we get the green light from QA, the new idea is finally  
deployedto actual customers.  
In the majority of companies that I first meet, large and small,  
thisisessentiallyhowtheywork,andhaveworked,formanyyears.Yet  
thesesamecompaniesconsistentlycomplainaboutthelackofinnovation  
andtheverylongtimeittakestomakeitfromideatocustomers’hands.  
You might recognize that while I mentioned Agile, and while  
almost everyone today claims to be Agile, what I’ve just described is  
very much a waterfall process. In fairness to the engineers, they’re  
typically doing about as much Agile as they can, given the broader  
waterfall context.  
Okay, so that may be what most teams do, but why is that neces-  
sarilythereasonforsomanyproblems?Let’sconnectthedotsnow,so  
wecanclearlyseewhythisverycommonwayofworkingisresponsible  
for most failed product efforts.  
In the list that follows, I’m going to share what I consider to be  
the top-10 biggest problems with this way of working. Keep in mind  
that all 10 of these problems are very serious issues, any one of which  
could derail a team. But many companies have more than one or even  
all of these problems.  
1\. Let’s start at the top—the  
source of ideas. This model  
leads to sales-driven spe-  
cials and stakeholder-driven  
products.Lotsmoretocome  
onthiskeytopic,butfornow,  
let me just say that this is  
Whilealmosteveryone

not the source of our best product ideas. Another consequence  
ofthisapproachisthelackofteamempowerment.Inthismodel,  
they’re just there to implement—they’re mercenaries.  
2\. Next, let’s talk about the fatal flaw in these business cases. To be  
clear, I’m personally in favor of doing business cases, at least for  
ideasthatneedalargerinvestment.Butthewaymostcompanies  
do them at this stage to come up with a prioritized roadmap is  
trulyridiculousandhere’swhy.Rememberthosetwokeyinputs  
toeverybusinesscase?Howmuchmoneyyou’llmake,andhow  
muchitwillcost?Well,thecold,hardtruthisthat,atthisstage,  
we have no clue about either of these. In fact, we can’tknow.  
We can’t know how much money we’ll make because that  
dependsentirelyonhowgoodthesolutionturnsouttobe.Ifthe  
team does an excellent job, this could be wildly successful and  
literally change the course of the company. The truth, however,  
is that many product ideas end up making absolutely nothing.  
And that’s not an exaggeration for effect. Literally nothing \(we  
know this from A/B testing\).  
In any case, one of the most critical lessons in product is  
knowingwhatwecan’tknow, and we just can’t know at this stage  
how much money we’ll make.  
Likewise, we have no idea what it will cost to build. With-  
out knowing the actual solution, this is extremely hard for engi-  
neering to predict. Most experienced engineers will refuse to  
even give an estimate at this stage, but some are pressured into  
the old t-shirt sizing compromise—just let us know if this is  
“small, medium, large, or extra large.”  
Butcompaniesreallywantthoseprioritizedroadmaps,and  
to get one, they need some kind of system to rate the ideas. So  
people play the business case game.  
3\. An even bigger issue is what comes next, which is when com-  
panies get really excited about their product roadmaps. I’ve seen  
countlessroadmapsovertheyears,andthevastmajorityofthem  
are essentially prioritized lists of features and projects. Market-  
ingneedsthisfeatureforacampaign.Salesneedsthisfeaturefor  
a new customer. Someone wants a PayPal integration. You get  
the idea. The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts **19**  
But here’s the prob-  
lem—maybe the biggest  
problem of all. It’s what I call  
the two inconvenient truths  
Thefirsttruthisthatat  
leasthalfofourideasare  
justnotgoingtowork.  
aboutproduct.  
The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not  
going to work. There are many reasons for an idea to not work  
out. The most common is that customers just aren’t as excited  
about this idea as we are. So, they choose not to use it. Some-  
times they want to use it and they try it out, but the product is  
so complicated that it’s simply more trouble than it’s worth, so  
usersagainchoosenottouseit.Sometimestheissueisthatcus-  
tomerswouldloveit,butitturnsouttobemuchmoreinvolved  
to build than we thought, and we decide we simply can’t afford  
the time and money required to deliver it.  
So, I promise you that at least half the ideas on your  
roadmap are not going to deliver what you hope. \(By the way,  
the really good teams assume that at least three quarters of the  
ideas won’t perform like they hope.\)  
If that’s not bad enough, the second inconvenient truth is  
that even with the ideas that do prove to have potential, it typ-  
ically takes several iterations to get the implementation of this  
idea to the point where it delivers the necessary business value.  
We call that timetomoney.  
One of the most important things about product that I’ve  
learned is that there is simply no escaping these inconvenient  
truths, no matter how smart you might be. And I’ve had the  
good fortune to work with many truly exceptional product  
teams. The real difference is how you deal with these truths.  
4\. Next, let’s consider the roleofproductmanagementin this model.  
In fact, we wouldn’t call this role product management—it’s  
really a form of project management. In this model, it’s more  
aboutgatheringrequirementsanddocumentingthemforengineers.  
At this point, let me just say that this is 180 degrees away from  
the reality of modern tech product management.  
5\. It’s a similar story with the roleofdesign. It’s way too late in the  
game to get the real value of design, and mostly what’s being **20** INSPIRED  
doneiswhatwecallthe“lipstickonthepig”model.Thedamage  
hasalreadybeendone,andnowwe’rejusttryingtoputacoatof  
paintonthemess.TheUXdesignersknowthisisnotgood,but  
they try to make it look as nice and consistent as they can.  
6\. Maybe the biggest missed opportunity in this model is the fact  
that engineeringgetsbroughtinwaytoolate. We say if you’re just  
usingyourengineerstocode,you’reonlygettingabouthalftheir  
value.Thelittlesecretinproductisthatengineersaretypicallythe

value and potential of Agile methods. What you’re really seeing  
isAgilefordelivery,buttherestoftheorganizationandcontext

8\. This entire process is very project-centric. The company usually  
fundsprojects,staffsprojects,pushesprojectsthroughtheorga-

output and product is all about outcome. This process predictably  
leads to orphaned projects. Yes, something was finally released,  
but it doesn’t meet its objectives so what really was the point?  
Inanycase,it’saseriousproblem,andnotclosetohowweneed  
to build products.  
9\. Thebiggestflawoftheoldwaterfallprocesshasalwaysbeen,and  
remains,thatalltheriskisattheend,whichmeansthatcustomer  
validationhappenswaytoolate.  
The key principle in Lean methods is to reduce waste,  
and one of the biggest forms of waste is to design, build,  
test, and deploy a feature or product only to find out it is not  
what was needed. The irony is that many teams believe they’re  
applying Lean principles; yet, they follow this basic process I’ve  
justdescribed.AndthenIpointouttothemthattheyaretrying  
out ideas in one of the most expensive, slowest ways we know.  
10\. Finally,whilewe’rebusydoingthisprocessandwastingourtime  
andmoney,thebiggestlossofallusuallyturnsouttobetheoppor-  
tunitycost of what the organization could have and should have  
been doing instead. We can’t get that time or money back. The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts **21**  
It’s no surprise that so many companies spend so much time  
and money and get so little in return. I warned you this could be  
depressing. But it’s critical that you have a deep understanding  
of exactly why your company needs to change how it works, if,  
indeed, your company is working  
this way.  
The good news is I promise  
you that the best teams oper-

thereisalwaysawillingindustry—readyandwaitingtoservewith  
books,coaching,training,andconsulting.Butthereisnosilverbullet,  
andinevitablypeoplefigurethisout.That’s whenthebacklashbegins.  
As I write this, it’s in vogue to criticize both Lean and Agile.  
I have no doubt that many people and teams are in some mea-  
sure disappointed with the results from their adoption of both Lean  
and Agile. And I understand the reasons for this. That said, I am con-  
vinced that Lean and Agile values and principles are here to stay. Not  
somuchtheparticularmanifestations ofthesemethodsthatmanyteams  
use today, but the core principles behind them. I would argue that  
they both represent meaningful progress, and I would never want to  
go backward on those two fronts.  
But as I said, they are not silver bullets either, and as with any  
tool, you have to be smart about how you use it. I meet countless  
teams that claim to be following Lean principles; yet, they work for  
months on what they call an MVP, and they really don’t know what  
they have and whether it will sell until they’ve spent substantial time

andmoney—hardlyinthespiritofLean.Ortheygowayoverboardand  
thinktheyhavetotestandvalidateeverything,sotheygonowherefast.  
And, as I just pointed out, the way Agile is practiced in most  
product companies is hardly Agile in any meaningful sense.  
ThebestproductteamsIknowhavealreadymovedpasthowmost  
teams practice these methods—leveraging the core principles of Lean  
andAgile,butraisingthebaronwhatthey’retryingtoachieveandhow  
they work.  
When I see these teams, they may frame the issues a little differ-  
ently, sometimes using different nomenclature, but at the heart, I see  
three overarching principles at work\:  
1\. Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. In modern  
teams, we tackle these risks prior to deciding to build anything.  
These risks include value risk \(whether customers will buy it\),  
usability risk \(whether users can figure out how to use it\), feasi-  
bility risk \(whether our engineers can build what we need with  
thetime,skills,andtechnologywehave\),andbusiness viability risk  
\(whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our  
business—sales, marketing, finance, legal, etc.\).  
2\. Productsaredefinedanddesignedcollaboratively,ratherthan  
sequentially. They have finally moved beyond the old model  
in which a product manager defines requirements, a designer  
designs a solution that delivers on those requirements, and then  
engineering implements those requirements, with each person  
livingwiththeconstraintsanddecisionsoftheonesthatpreceded.  
In strong teams, product, design, and engineering work side by  
side,inagive-and-takeway,tocomeupwithtechnology-powered  
solutions that our customers love and that work for our business.  
3\. Finally, it’s all about solving problems, not implementing  
features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output.  
Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution.  
They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem.  
It’s about business results.  
You will see that I keep these three overarching principles front  
and center throughout this book. **CHAPTER**  
# 8  
# Key Concepts  
**I**n this book, I refer to a set of concepts that form the foundation of  
modern product work. I’d like to briefly explain them here.  
# Holistic Product  
I have already been using the term productpretty loosely. I did say I’m  
onlytalkingabouttechnology-poweredproducts.But,moregenerally,  
when I refer to product I mean a very holistic definition of product.  
This certainly includes the functionality—the features.  
But it also includes the technologythat enables this functionality.  
It also includes the user experience design that presents this  
functionality.  
And it includes how we monetizethis functionality.  
It includes how we attract and acquireusersandcustomers.  
And it can also include offlineexperiencesas well that are essential  
to delivering the product’s value.  
**25** **26** INSPIRED  
If, for example, your product is an e-commerce site, then  
this would include the merchandise-fulfillment experience and the  
merchandise-return experience. In general, for e-commerce busi-  
nesses, product includes everything except the actual merchandise  
being sold.  
Similarly, for a media company, we refer to the product as  
everything except the content.  
The point is to have a very inclusive and holistic definition of  
product. You are not just concerned with implementing features.  
# Continuous Discovery and Delivery  
I explained previously that most companies still have a process that is  
essentially waterfall at its core, and I told you that what we do in a  
modern team is very different.  
We’ll be going more into the product development process later,  
but I do need to introduce a high-level concept about process at this  
pointinourdiscussion.Thatis,therearetwoessentialhigh-levelactiv-  
ities in all product teams. Weneedtodiscovertheproducttobebuilt,and  
weneedtodeliverthatproducttomarket.  
Discovery and delivery are our two main activities on a  
cross-functional product team, and they are both typically ongoing  
and in parallel.  
There are several ways to think about this and to visualize it, but  
the concept is fairly simple\: We are always working in parallel to both  
discoverthenecessaryproducttobebuilt—whichisprimarilywhatthe  
productmanageranddesignerworkoneveryday—whiletheengineers  
work to deliverproduction-quality product.  
Now, as you’ll soon see, it’s a little more involved than that.  
For example, the engineers are also helping daily on discovery  
\(and many of the best innovations come from that participation,  
so this is not a minor point\), and  
the product manager and designer  
are also helping daily on delivery  
\(mainly to clarify intended behav-  
ior\). But this is what’s going on at a

# Product Discovery  
Discovery is very much about the intense collaboration of product  
management, user experience design, and engineering. In discovery,  
we are tackling the various risks before we write even one line of  
production software.  
Thepurposeofproductdiscoveryistoquicklyseparatethegood  
ideas from the bad. The output of product discovery is a validated  
productbacklog.  
Specifically, this means getting answers to four critical questions\:  
1\. Will the user buy this \(or choose to use it\)?  
2\. Can the user figure out how to use this?  
3\. Can our engineers build this?  
4\. Can our stakeholders support this?  
# Prototypes  
Productdiscoveryinvolvesrunningaseriesofveryquickexperiments,  
andtodotheseexperimentsquicklyandinexpensively,weuseprototypes  
ratherthanproducts.Atthispoint,letmejustsaythatthereareseveral  
types of prototypes, each for different risks and situations, but they  
all require at least an order of magnitude of less time and effort than  
building a product. **28** INSPIRED  
To set your expectations,  
strong teams normally test many  
product ideas each week—on the  
orderof10to20ormoreperweek.  
I want to emphasize that  
these are experiments,typicallyrun

using prototypes. A prototype is  
not something that’s ready for prime time and certainly not some-  
thing your company would try to sell and stand behind. But they’re  
immensely useful, as they’re all about learning fast and cheap.  
# Product Delivery  
The purpose of all these prototypes and experiments in discovery is  
to quickly come up with something that provides some evidence it is  
worth building and that we can then deliver to our customers.  
This means the necessary scale, performance, reliability, fault  
tolerance, security, privacy, internationalization, and localization have  
been performed, and the product works as advertised.  
The purpose of product delivery is to build and deliver these  
production-quality technology products, something you can sell and  
run a business on.  
# Products and Product/Market Fit  
Justbecausewe’veinvestedthetimeandefforttocreatearobustprod-

resultofdelivery.Thediscoveryactivitieshelpusdeterminetheneces-  
sary product, but it is delivery that actually does the work necessary to  
build, test, and release the product. Key Concepts **29**  
# Product Vision  
The final critical concept is product vision. This refers to the  
longer-term objective of this product, normally 2–10 years out.  
It is how we as a product organization intend to deliver on the  
company’s mission.  
So,weuseprototypestoconductrapidexperimentsinproductdis-  
covery, and then in delivery, we build and release products in hopes of  
achievingproduct/marketfit,whichisakeysteponthewaytodelivering  
on the company’s productvision.  
Now don’t worry if you’re hazy on any of these concepts. I  
know you likely have many questions, but they’ll hopefully become  
clear as we dive deeper into each topic. It’s also normal to be a little  
skeptical—“How can I possibly run 15 of these experiments in a  
week?”  
I warned you that strong product teams work nothing like most  
teams, and this should give you your first taste of how different things  
can be.  
# Minimum Viable Product  
The concept of minimum viable product \(MVP\) is one of the most  
importantconceptsintheproductworld.Ithasbeenaroundformany  
years.ThetermwascoinedbyFrankRobinson\(in2001\),andIwrote  
about the concept in the first edition of this book \(in 2008\). It was  
popularized, however, in the book The Lean Startup by Eric Ries  
in 2011.  
Eric’s book did a great deal to help product teams, and to  
me, it is a must-read book for all product people. But I think most  
people would likely admit that the concept of MVP has caused  
considerableconfusionwithinproductteams,andIspendalotofmy  
time helping teams get value out of this critical concept.  
ThevastmajorityoftimesImeetateamthat hasbeenworking  
hard to create an MVP I am able to convince them that they could  
have achieved the same learning in a fraction of the time and effort.  
\(continued\) **30** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
They have spent literally months building an MVP when they could  
have had this same learning in days or, sometimes, even in hours.  
The other unhappy consequence is that very often the rest of  
the company—especially key leadership in sales and marketing—is  
confused and embarrassed by what the product team is trying to get  
customers to buy and use.  
Whilethisispartlyaresultofthewaymostpeoplehavelearned  
this concept, I think the root of the issue is that while the P in MVP  
stands for product, an MVP should neverbe an actual product \(where  
productisdefinedassomethingthatyourdeveloperscanreleasewith  
confidence, that your customers can run their business on, and that  
you can sell and support\).  
The MVP should be a prototype, not a product.  
Building an actual product-quality deliverable to learn, even if  
that deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste  
of time and money, which of course is the antithesis of Lean.

# The Right People  
**E**veryproductbeginswiththepeopleonthecross-functionalprod-

models of the past. For many organizations, the roles and responsibil-

# Product Teams  
# Overview  
This is probably the most important concept in this entire book\:  
It’s all about the product team.  
You’ll hear me say this many different ways throughout the  
chapters to follow, but so much of what we do in a strong product  
organization is to optimize for the effectiveness of product teams. **CHAPTER**  
# 9  
# Principles of Strong  
# Product Teams  
**I**nlaterchapters,Iexploreeachofthekeyrolesonateam,butinthis  
chapter, I explain the principles of a strong product team.  
Product teams are sometimes referred to as a dedicated product  
teamor as a durableproductteam, to emphasize that these are not cre-  
ated just to work on a single project or feature, or sometimes as a  
squad—derivedfromthemilitaryanalogyandmeanttoemphasizethat  
these are cross-functional teams.  
A product team is a group of people who bring together differ-  
ent specialized skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a  
product or at least a substantial piece of a larger product.  
There are many ways to set up product teams \(we’ll discussthese  
later in the section People @ Scale\). But in good product companies,  
you’ll find that, despite the differences due to their unique products  
and circumstances, there are several very important similarities.

# Team of Missionaries  
There are many benefits of product teams, but a big goal is captured  
best by a quote from John Doerr, the famous Silicon Valley venture  
capitalist\: “We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.”  
Mercenaries build whatever they’re told to build. Missionaries are  
true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for  
their customers. In a dedicated  
product team, the team acts and  
feels a lot like a startup within  
the larger company, and that’s very  
Weneedteamsof  
missionaries,notteams  
ofmercenaries.  
much the intention.  
# Team Composition  
A typical product team is comprised of a product manager, a product  
designer, and somewhere between two and about 10 to 12 engineers.  
Of course, if the product you’re working on doesn’t have a  
user-facing experience—such as for a set of programmatic APIs—you  
probably don’t need the product designer. But many product teams  
do need this person on board, and throughout this book, I’ll generally  
assume your team does, too.  
Teams might also have a few other members such as a product  
marketing manager, one or more test automation engineers, a user  
researcher, a data analyst, and, in larger product organizations, a  
delivery manager.  
Don’t worry if you don’t yet know what some of these roles  
are—we’ll soon explore each of them.  
# Team Empowerment and Accountability  
A big part of the concept of product teams is that they are there to  
solve hard problems for the business. They are given clear objectives,  
and they own delivering on those objectives.  
They are empowered to figure out the best way to meet those  
objectives, and they are accountable for the results. Principles of Strong Product Teams **35**  
# Team Size  
There’s no rule that says all product teams in a company need to be  
thesamesize.It’struethereisthenotionofcriticalmassforaproduct  
team—usuallyoneproductmanager,onedesigner,andtwoengineers.  
However,someteamsmightjustifyfiveengineersandtwotestautoma-  
tion engineers—others even more.  
There is a practical upper bound on a team, which usually works  
out to be around 8–12 engineers. You’ve probably heard about the  
two-pizzarule, which is intended to help keep teams in this range.  
More important than the absolute size of the team is the balance  
of skills needed to ensure we build the right things, and build those  
things right.  
# Team Reporting Structure  
Note that I haven’t said anything yet about who works for whom.  
A product team is not about reporting relationships—it has an  
intentionallyflatorganizationalstructure.Usually,everyoneonaprod-  
uctteamisanindividualcontributor,andtherearenopeoplemanagers.  
Thepeopleontheteamtypicallycontinuetoreporttotheirfunc-  
tional manager. For example, the engineers report to an engineering  
manager. Likewise, the designer usually reports to a head of design,  
andtheproductmanagerreportsintoaheadofproduct.So,thisisnot  
about reporting relationships.  
To be absolutely clear, the product manager is not the boss of  
anyoneon the product team.  
# Team Collaboration  
Aproductteamisasetofhighlyskilledpeoplewhocometogetherfor  
an extended period of time to solve hard business problems.  
The nature of the relationship is more about true collaboration.  
I don’t mean collaboration as a buzzword, either. I literally mean  
product, design, and engineering working out solutions together.  
Muchmoreonthattocome,butatthispoint,it’simportantforyouto  
understand that this is not a hierarchy. **36** INSPIRED  
# Team Location  
I also haven’t said anything yet about where the members of the team  
arephysicallylocated.Whilethisisn’talwayspossible,wetryveryhard  
to co-locatethis team.  
Co-location means that team members literally sit right next to  
oneanother.Thatdoesn’tmeaninthesamebuildingoreventhesame  
floor.Itmeanscloseenoughtoeasilyseeeachother’scomputerscreens.  
I know this sounds a bit old school, and the tools for remote col-  
laboration are getting better all the time, but the best companies have  
learned the value of sitting together as a team.  
If you’ve ever been a member of a co-located product team, you  
likely already know what I mean. But, as you’ll see from how we do  
our work on a product team, there is a special dynamic that occurs  
when the team sits together, eats lunch together, and builds personal  
relationships with one another.  
I’m aware this can be a bit of an emotional topic. For personal  
reasons,quiteafewpeoplelivesomewhereotherthanwheretheywork,  
and their livelihood depends on working effectively remotely.  
I don’t want to paint this as too black or white, but I also don’t  
wanttomisleadyou.Allotherthingsbeingequal,aco-locatedteamis  
goingtosubstantiallyoutperformadispersedteam.That’sjusttheway  
it is.  
This is alsoone of the reasons why we greatly prefermembers of  
aproductteamtobeactualemployeesandnotcontractorsoragencies.  
It’smucheasiertobeco-locatedandtobeastablememberoftheteam  
if the person is an employee.  
Note that there is nothing wrong with a company having multi-  
ple locations, so long as we try hard to have co-located teams in each  
location.  
We’ll talk later about what we do when not all the members are  
able to sit together.  
# Team Scope  
Once you’ve got the basics of a product team, the next big question is  
this\: What is the scope or charter of each team? That is, what is each  
team responsible for? Principles of Strong Product Teams **37**  
One dimension of this is the type of work to be done, and it’s  
important that a product team has responsibility for all the work—all  
theprojects,features,bugfixes,performancework,optimizations,and  
content changes—everything and anything for their product.  
Theotherdimensionisthescopeofworktobedone.Insometypes  
of companies, the product team is responsible for a complete product.  
Butit’smorecommontodaythattheproductisthefullcustomerexpe-  
rience \(imagine a Facebook or a PayPal\), and each team is responsible  
for some smaller but meaningful piece of that experience.  
For example, you might be working on a team at eBay that’s  
responsible for technology to detect and prevent fraud or tools and  
services for high-volume sellers. Or, at Facebook, your team might be  
responsiblefornewsfeeds,aniOSnativemobileapp,orthecapabilities  
required for a specific vertical market.  
This is an easy topic for a small startup, as you typically just have  
one or a small number of teams, which makes it relatively easy to split  
things up.  
But as a company grows, the number of teams expands from a  
handfulto20,50,ormoreteamsinlargeproductcompanies.Thecoor-  
dination gets harder \(much more on that when we get to the section  
on Product @ Scale\), but the concept is highly scalable and, in fact, is  
one of the keys to scalability.  
There are lots of useful ways to slice up the pie. Sometimes we  
have each team focus on a different type of user or customer. Some-  
timeseachteamisresponsibleforadifferenttypeofdevice.Sometimes  
we break things up by workflow or customer journey.  
Sometimes, actuallyveryoften, we arelargelydefining the teams  
basedonthearchitecture.Thisisprettycommonbecausethearchitec-  
ture drives the technology stack, which often requires different types  
of engineering expertise.  
Inanycase,what’scriticallyimportantisalignmentbetweenprod-  
uctmanagementandengineering.Thisiswhytheheadofproductand  
the head of engineering normally get together to define the size and  
scope of the teams.  
Iwilltellyouthere’sneveraperfectwaytocarveupthepie.Real-  
ize that, when you optimize for one thing, it comes at the expense  
of something else. So, decide what’s most important to you and go  
with that. **38** INSPIRED  
# Team Duration  
I’vementionedafewtimesalreadythattheseteamsneedtobedurable,  
butIhaven’tsaidwhetherthismeansforafewmonthsorseveralyears.  
The bottom line is that we try hard to keep teams together and  
fairly stable.  
Whilethingsdocomeup,andpeoplechangejobsandteams,once  
themembersofateamgettoknowoneanother,andlearnhowtowork  
well together, it’s honestly a beautiful and powerful thing, and we try  
hard not to mess up that dynamic.  
Another reason that durability is important is that it can take  
some time to gain enough expertise in an area to innovate. If people  
are moving from team to team all the time, it’s hard for them to get  
that expertise and to feel the necessary sense of ownership over their  
product and missionary-like passion.  
And to be clear, a product team is not something we create just  
todeliveraspecificproject.It’snearlyimpossibletohaveateamofmis-  
sionarieswhenthey’repulledtogetherforaprojectthatlastsonlyafew  
months and is then disbanded.  
# Team Autonomy  
If we want teams to feel empowered and have missionary-like passion  
for solving customer problems, we need to give them a significant  
degree of autonomy. Obviously, this doesn’t mean they can go off and  
work on whatever looks fun, but it does mean that they are able to try  
to solve the problems they are assigned in the best way they see fit.  
It also means we try to mini-  
mize dependencies between teams.  
Notice that I said “minimize” and  
not “eliminate.” At scale, it’s just

# Why It Works  
Productcompaniesmovedtothismodelseveralyearsago,andit’snow  
one of the pillars of modern, strong product organizations. There are  
several reasons why this model has been so effective.  
First, collaboration is built on relationships, and product  
teams—especially co-located teams—are designed to nurture these  
relationships.  
Second,toinnovateyouneedexpertise,andthedurablenatureof  
product teams lets people go deep enough to gain that expertise.  
Third, instead of just building what others determine might be  
valuable,intheproductteammodelthefullteamunderstands—needs  
to understand—the business objectives and context. And most impor-  
tant, the full team feels ownership and responsibility for the outcome.  
Instead of the old project-oriented model, which is all about get-  
ting something pushed through the process and out the door, in the  
dedicatedteammodel,theteamisnotoffthehookjustbecausesome-  
thing launches. They don’t rest until and unless it’s working for the  
users and for the business.

this model.  
Ontheotherhand,ifyourcompanyisnotyetsetuparounddedi-

You don’t have to move the whole organization there at  
once—you can start a team as a pilot. But one way or another, it’s  
essential that you create or join a durable product team.

# The Product Manager  
**T**his book is about becoming an excellent product manager, and in  
thischapter,Iwanttobeveryexplicitaboutwhatthatreallymeans.  
But first, it’s time for a little dose of tough love.  
There are essentially three ways for a product manager to work,  
and I argue only one of them leads to success\:  
1\. The product manager can escalate every issue and decision  
up to the CEO. In this model, the product manager is really a  
backlogadministrator. Lots of CEOs tell me this is the model they  
find themselves in, and it’s not scaling. If you think the product  
managerjobiswhat’sdescribedinaCertifiedScrumProductOwner  
class, you almost certainly fall into this category.  
2\. The product manager can call a meeting with all the stake-  
holders in the room and then let them fight it out. This  
is design by committee, and it rarely yields anything beyond  
mediocrity. In this model, very common in large companies, the  
product manager is really a roadmapadministrator.  
3\. The product manager can do his or her job.  
**41** **42** INSPIRED  
Myintentioninthisbookisto  
convince you of this third way of  
working. It will take me the entire  
book to describe how the strong  
product manager does his or her

job, but let me just say for now  
that this is a very demanding job and requires a strong set of skills  
and strengths.  
Thereasonforcallingthisoutsobluntlyisthat,inmanycompa-  
nies, especially older, enterprise companies, the product manager role  
hasabadreputation.Whattoooftenhappensisthatthecompanytakes  
peoplefromotherorganizationalroles—oftenprojectmanagementor  
sometimes business analysts—and they say, “We’re moving to Agile  
and we don’t need project managers or business analysts anymore, so  
we need you to be a product manager.”  
Thehonesttruthisthattheproductmanagerneedstobeamong  
the strongest talent in the company. If the product manager doesn’t  
have the technology sophistication, doesn’t have the business savvy,  
doesn’t have the credibility with the key executives, doesn’t have the  
deepcustomerknowledge,doesn’thavethepassionfortheproduct,or  
doesn’t have the respect of their product team, then it’s a sure recipe  
for failure.  
There are lots of ways to describe this particular role. Some  
people prefer to focus on the raw ingredients of what makes a strong  
product manager. Others tend to focus on the product manager’s  
day-to-day activities and what they’ll be spending their time doing.  
We’ll cover all that, but to me what’s most important to talk  
about is what product managers are responsible for contributing to  
their team. That’s not so obvious for the product manager. It’s not  
that unusual for people to question whether they even need a product  
manager. If they don’t design and they don’t code, why bother?  
This is a clear sign of a company that hasn’t experienced strong  
product management.  
# Key Responsibilities  
At one level, the responsibilities of the product manager are pretty  
straightforward. He or she is responsible for evaluating opportunities The Product Manager **43**  
anddeterminingwhatgetsbuiltand  
delivered to customers. We gener-  
allydescribewhatneedstogetbuilt  
on the product backlog.  
Sounds simple enough. And  
the mechanics of that are not the  
hard part. What’s hard is to make

it’sbecauseeveryoneonthe

sure that what goes on the product  
backlogisworthbuilding.And,today,onthebestteams,theengineers  
anddesignerswanttoseesomeevidencethatwhatyou’reaskingtobuild  
is truly worth building.  
But if you want to know why the product manager role is  
consideredsoimportanttodaybyCEOsandventurecapitalists\(VCs\),  
it’s this\:  
Every business depends on customers. And what customers  
buy—or choose to use—is your product. The product is the result of  
what the product team builds, and the product manager is responsible  
for what the product team will build.  
So,thisiswhytheproductmanageristhepersonweholdrespon-  
sible and accountable for the success of the product.  
When a product succeeds, it’s because everyone on the team did  
what they needed to do. But when a product fails, it’s the product  
manager’s fault.  
You can start to see why this role is a proving ground for future  
CEOsandwhythebestVCsonlywanttoinvestinacompanythathas  
one of these proven product people as one of the co-founders.  
So, this chapter is really about what you need to do to succeed  
at this job. In that spirit, there are four key responsibilities of a strong  
productmanager;fourthingsthattherestofyourteamiscountingon  
you to bring to the party\:  
# Deep Knowledge of the Customer  
Firstandforemostisdeepknowledgeoftheactualusersandcustomers.  
To make this explicit, you need to become an acknowledged expert  
on the customer\: their issues, pains, desires, how they think—and for  
business products, how they work, and how they decide to buy. **44** INSPIRED  
This is what informs so many of the decisions that must be made  
everyday.Withoutthisdeepcustomerknowledge,you’rejustguessing.  
This requires both qualitative learning \(to understand why our users  
and customers behave the way they do\), and quantitative learning \(to  
understand what they are doing\), which is what we’ll talk about next.  
Itshouldgowithoutsayingasit’sreallytablestakesforaproduct  
manager, but just to be clear, the product manager must also be an  
undisputed expert on your actual product.  
# Deep Knowledge of the Data  
Today,productmanagersareexpectedtobecomfortablewithdataand  
analytics. They are expected to have both quantitative skills as well  
as qualitative skills. The Internet enables unprecedented volume and  
timeliness of data.  
A big part of knowing your customer is understanding what  
they’re doing with your product. Most product managers start their  
daywithhalfanhourorsointheanalyticstools,understandingwhat’s  
beenhappeninginthepast24hours.They’relookingatsalesanalytics  
and usage analytics. They’re looking at the results of A/B tests.  
You might have a data analyst to help you with this, but the  
analysisof the data and understandingyou get of your customer is not  
something you can delegate.  
# Deep Knowledge of Your Business  
Successful products are not only loved by your customers, but they  
work for your business.  
The third critical contribution—and the one that is often  
considered the most difficult by  
many product managers—is a deep  
understanding of your business and  
Successfulproductsarenot  
onlylovedbyyour  
how it works, and the role your  
productplaysinyourbusiness.This  
is tougher than it sounds.  
customers,buttheyworkfor  
yourbusiness. The Product Manager **45**  
This means knowing who your various stakeholders are and  
especially learning the constraints they operate under. There are  
usually key stakeholders representing general management, sales,  
marketing,finance,legal,businessdevelopment,andcustomerservice.  
Your CEO is usually a very important stakeholder as well.  
Succeeding in the job of product means convincing each key  
stakeholder that you understand their constraints and that you are  
committed to only delivering solutions that you believe are consistent  
with those constraints.  
# Deep Knowledge of Your Market and Industry  
The fourth critical contribution is deep knowledge of the market  
and industry in which you’re competing. This includes not only  
your competitors but also key trends in technology, customer behav-  
iors and expectations, following the relevant industry analysts, and  
understandingtheroleofsocialmediaforyourmarketandcustomers.  
Most markets have more competitors today than ever before.  
Further, companies understand the value in making products that are  
sticky, and this means that it can be difficult for prospective customers  
to move from your competitor to you. This is one of the big reasons  
why it is not enough to have feature parity with a competitor. Rather,  
you need to be substantially better to motivate a user or customer to  
switch.  
Another reason to have a deep understanding of the competitive  
landscape is that your products will need to fit into a more general  
ecosystem of other products, and ideally your product is not only  
compatible with that ecosystem but adds significant value to it.  
Further, your industry is constantly moving, and we must create  
products for where the market will be tomorrow, not where it was  
yesterday.  
As an example, as of this writing, there is a major enabling  
technology trend sweeping through our industry, which is based on  
machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence. I feel com-  
fortablepredictingthatthiswillbeamajortechnologytrendforatleast  
the next decade, and this is why you need to love technology-powered **46** INSPIRED  
products. What is possible is constantly changing. If you’re not  
excited about learning these new technologies, and exploring with  
your engineers and designers how you can use these trends to deliver  
dramatically improved products and experiences to your customers,  
then you really need to consider whether this career is for you.  
To summarize, these are the four critical contributions you need  
tobringtoyourteam\:deepknowledge\(1\)ofyourcustomer,\(2\)ofthe  
data, \(3\) of your business and its stakeholders, and \(4\) of your market  
and industry.  
If you’re a designer or engineer, and you’ve been asked to cover  
theproductmanagerroleaswell,thenthisiswhatyouneedtosignup  
for. I warned you—it’s a ton of work.  
One additional note\: In some companies, there is so much in  
terms of industry and domain knowledge that the product manager  
may be supplemented with what are called domain experts or subject  
matterexperts. Examples of domain experts can be found in companies  
that build tax software or create medical devices. In these cases, you  
can’t expect the product managers to have the necessary level of  
domain depth, in addition to everything else. But these cases are fairly  
rare. The normal case is that the product manager does need to have  
\(or be able to learn\) the necessary domain expertise.  
It normally takes about two to three months of dedicated work  
foranewproductmanagertogetuptospeed.Thisassumesyouhavea  
manager who can give you the help and access you need to gain this  
expertise, including lots of access to customers, access to data \(and  
when necessary, training in the tools to access that data\), access to  
key stakeholders, and time to learn your product and industry inside  
and out.  
# Smart, Creative, and Persistent  
Now that we’ve seen what the product manager needs to contribute  
to the team, let’s consider the kind of person who thrives in this  
environment. Thesuccessfulproduct  
managermustbethevery  
bestversionsof smart,  
creative, andpersistent.  
The Product Manager **47**  
Thesuccessfulproductmanagermustbetheverybestversionsof  
smart, creative,and persistent.  
By smart, I don’t just mean  
raw IQ. I especially mean intellec-  
tually curious, quickly learning and  
applying new technologies to solve  
problems for customers, to reach  
new audiences, or to enable new  
business models.  
By creative, I mean thinking outside the normal product box of  
features to solve business problems.  
By persistent, I mean pushing companies way beyond their  
comfortzonewithcompellingevidence,constantcommunication,and  
building bridges across functions in the face of stubborn resistance.  
The passion for products and for solving customer problems is  
notsomethingIthinkyoucanteach.That’ssomethingyoueitherhave  
or don’t have, and it is among the first things I interview for when I’m  
evaluating potential product managers. I assume that youhave this.  
Maybe this is a good time to be very honest with you about the  
demands of this role.  
The product managerpositionis not a 9-to-5job. I’m not saying  
you need to be in the office 15 hours a day, but I am saying that there  
is a ton of work, and it follows you home every night. Pretty much  
any other role on a product team is better if you’re looking for a good  
work-life balance. Now, I know it may not be politically correct to say  
that, but I don’t think I’m doing you any favors by misleading you.  
The level of time and effort required by the product manager role is  
extremely tough to sustain if you’re not personally passionate about  
your products and your role.  
Perhaps the most important thing I can tell you to help you suc-  
ceed is that you simply must take very seriously your preparation for  
this role.  
• Start by becoming an expert in your users and customers. Share  
very openly what you learn, both the good and the bad. Become **48** INSPIRED  
your team’s and your company’s go-to person for understanding  
anything about your customer—quantitative and qualitative.  
• Work to establish a strong relationship with your key stakehold-  
ers and business partners. Convince them of two things\: \(1\) You  
understand the constraints they operate under. \(2\) You will only  
bring to them solutions that you believe will work within those  
constraints.  
• Becomeanundisputedexpertonyourproductandyourindustry.  
Again, share your knowledge openly and generously.  
• Finally,workveryhardtobuildandnurturethestrongcollabora-  
tive relationship with your product team.  
I’m not saying that doing all this is easy; it’s not. But believe me

# Product Manager Profiles  
Inadditiontogivingyouthetheoryandtechniquesinthisbook,Imake  
apointofintroducingyoutorealpeople—productmanagerswhohave  
done their job and done it well. These individuals include\:  
• Jane Manning of Google  
• Lea Hickman of Adobe  
• Alex Pressland of the BBC  
• Martina Lauchengco of Microsoft  
• Kate Arnold of Netflix  
• Camille Hearst of Apple  
Anyone who’s ever worked in product for any amount of time  
knows that creating products is never easy. I selected these particular  
individualstoillustratetheverydifficultbutessentialcontributionthat  
comes from a strong product manager.  
The products I highlight are all iconic, and you will immediately  
recognize them. But few people know the product managers behind  
these products, and even fewer know their backstories. The Product Manager **49**  
Each of the product managers I selected went out of her way to  
emphasizetomejusthowamazingtheirproductteamwas,andhowin  
no way was the success due to their efforts alone. But hopefully these  
examples help make clear to you the true and essential contribution of  
the product manager.  
The big points I hope you take away from these examples are\:  
1\. Product management is absolutely distinct from the other  
disciplines. It’s clearly different than the contribution of the  
designers, and it’s also clearly not a project manager. There is  
some amount of project management inevitably involved, just as  
there is for all leadership positions. But to characterize this as a  
project manager is to completely miss the essence of the role.  
The role I would argue the product manager is most similar to is  
the role of the CEO. But with the obvious difference that, unlike  
the CEO, the product manager is not the boss of anyone.  
2\. Like a CEO, the product manager must deeply understand  
all aspects of the business. The product manager must ensure  
a business outcome, not just ensure a product gets defined. This  
requires a good understanding of the many interrelated parts  
andconstraintsofthebusiness—financial,marketing,sales,legal,  
partnership, service, the customer environment, the technical  
capabilities, the user’s experience—and figure out a solution that  
works for the customers as well as for the business. But don’t  
think this means an MBA is required—not one of the impressive  
product managers I feature in this book has an MBA—or that  
you need to have all these skills yourself. You must simply have a  
broad understanding of how a product can affect a business and  
work with people from your team and across your company to  
cover everything that’s important.  
3\. In every one of these examples, the winning solutions didn’t  
come from users, customers, or sales. Rather, great products  
require an intense collaboration with design and engineering  
to solve real problems for your users and customers, in ways  
that meet the needs of your business. In each of these examples,  
the users had no idea the solution they fell in love with was  
possible. **50** INSPIRED  
4\. True leadership is a big  
part of what separates the  
great product people from  
the merely good ones. So,  
no matter what your title or

# The Two Critical Classes for Product Managers  
Product managers come to the role from any and all disciplines.

# The Product Designer  
**I**nthischapter,Idescribetheproductdesignerrole.ButI’mnottry-  
ingtospeakheretodesigners—I’maimingthisatproductmanagers  
who need to learn how to work effectively with designers.  
It’s amazing to me how many companies I encounter that just  
don’tunderstandwhyhavingstrongandtalenteddesignersissoimpor-  
tant. They understand the need for engineers, but often will waste  
significant time and money because they do not understand the need  
for design.  
Modern product designers are responsible for the following\:  
# Product Discovery  
In the old model, designers took requirements or specifications from  
product managers and used that to create their designs. In contrast,  
modernproductdesignerscontinuouslycollaboratewithproductman-  
agersandengineers—fromdiscoverytodelivery.Similarly,ratherthan  
sitting with fellow designers, the modern product designer sits side by  
**53** **54** INSPIRED  
side with his or her product manager, a full partner with the product  
manager on product discovery.  
Rather than being measured  
on the output of their design work,  
the product designer is measured  
onthesuccessoftheproduct.Given  
this, product designers have many  
of the same concerns as product  
managers.Theyaredeeplyoriented  
Rather than being  
measured on the output of

product designer is

around actual customers and the  
value their product brings to those customers. They also understand  
that the product is in service of a business and can incorporate those  
constraints into the design of the product. Designers further under-  
stand that the user experience is as important to customer value as is  
the underlying functionality.  
# Holistic User Experience Design  
User experience \(UX\) is much bigger than user interface \(UI\).  
Some people even use the term customer experience to further empha-  
size the point. UX is any way that customers and end users realize  
the value provided by your product. It includes all the touch points  
and interactions a customer has with your company and product over  
time. For modern products, this usually includes multiple different  
interfaces, as well as other customer touch points \(e-mail, marketing  
campaigns, sales process, customer support, and so forth\).  
With some products, UX also includes offline services, such as  
riding in a car summoned through Uber or staying in a house sourced  
through Airbnb.  
Good product designers think about the customer’s journey over  
timeastheyinteractwiththeproductandwiththecompanyasawhole.  
Dependingontheproduct,thelistoftouchpointscouldbeverylong,  
considering questions as\:  
• How will customers first learn about the product?  
• How will we onboard a first-time user and \(perhaps gradually\)  
reveal new functionality? The Product Designer **55**  
• How might users interact at different times during their day?  
• What other things are competing for the user’s attention?  
• How might things be different for a one-month-old customer  
versus a one-year-old customer?  
• How will we motivate a user to a higher level of commitment to  
the product?  
• How will we create moments of gratification?  
• How will a user share his experience with others?  
• How will customers receive an offline service?  
• What is the perceived responsiveness of the product?  
# Prototyping  
LaterinthisbookIexplorethemanytechniquesusedtotestoutprod-  
uct ideas. Many of these techniques depend on prototypes, and most  
of these prototypes are created by the product designer.  
Good product designers use prototypes as their primary canvas  
forcommunicatingideas,bothinternallyandexternally.Theyaregen-  
erally comfortable with many different prototyping tools and are able  
to apply the correct one for the task at hand.  
# User Testing  
Good product designers are constantly testing their ideas with real  
users and customers. They don’t just test when a prototype or idea  
is ready; they build testing into their weekly cadence, so they’re able  
to constantly validate and refine ideas as well as collect new insights  
they might not have been looking for. It also means that they aren’t as  
likelytobecometooattachedtoideasbeforetheycomeincontactwith  
objective, outside opinions.  
User testing is broader than usability testing. Product designers  
and their product teams utilize the opportunity to assess the value  
of their ideas. Will customers use or buy the product and, if not,  
why not? **56** INSPIRED  
# Interaction and Visual Design  
Interaction and visual design have historically been considered  
separate roles. Interaction design generally includes the underlying  
conceptual models \(e.g., a photo management application may have  
photos,albums,projects\),taskflows,andcontrollayoutstomanipulate  
those concepts. Visual design includes composition, typography, and  
how the visual brand is expressed.  
Modern product designers may have different strengths but,  
generally, have some level of skill with both interaction and visual  
design. Having a more complete tool set allows them to work quickly  
at different levels of fidelity, depending on the context. It also allows  
them to design experiences in ways that wouldn’t have been natural  
when thinking of interaction and visual design separately. This is  
particularly important in mobile interfaces in which designers must  
often create new models of interaction fundamentally intertwined  
with the visual design.  
If you’re building devices such as consumer electronics, there’s  
anothercriticaldimensiontodesign—industrial design—whichlooksat  
materials and design for manufacturing.  
# The Absence of Product Design  
Three situations in particular are incredibly common and serious  
problems\:  
1\. Youasproductmanagertrytodotheactualdesignyourself.Now,  
thisisdistinctfromthesituationwhereyouareatraineddesigner  
and have also taken on the product manager responsibilities. In

provide the engineers with wireframes, and they cobble together  
some form of visual design themselves.  
2\. You as product manager don’t provide the designs but, rather,  
provide very high-level user stories to the engineers. To begin  
coding, the engineers have no choice but to work out the design  
themselves. The Product Designer **57**  
3\. Youasproductmanagerprovidetheinteractiondesign—especially

looking for.  
Appleisoneofthemostvaluableanddesign-consciouscompanies  
on the planet; yet few tech companies understand the importance of  
designtalent.WhileeveryonetalksabouttheengineersatGoogleand  
Facebook—and their engineering is indeed strong—both companies  
have made huge investments in design talent.  
If you are building user-facing products, it’s critically important  
that you get a trained product designer for your team. If you’re doing  
productsforconsumers,Iwouldarguethatstrongdesigntodayistable  
stakes.Ifyou’redoingproductsforbusinesses,then thisisoneof your  
best competitive differentiators.  
It’ssadtosay,butmostproductsforbusinesseshaveawfuldesign.  
They’ve been able to get away with this, however, because the user is  
so often not the customer—the one that buys. I’m happy to say that’s  
now changing, and there’s a new breed of B2B \(business-to-business\)  
companies that take design very seriously. They are displacing the  
old guard.  
In the case of products for small businesses, the user is typically  
the buyer, so the bar is set as high as it is for consumer products.  
Butgettingyourorganizationtoinvestindesignstaffisonlyhalf  
of the solution.  
Here’s why.  
Many organizations wake up one morning and suddenly  
realize design is important. So, they spend money to bring  
this talent in-house; yet, they set up the operation like it’s an  
internal agency. You’re supposed  
to bring your design requests to  
this group of designers—often sit-

Instrongteamstoday,thedesigninformsthefunctionalityatleast  
as much as the functionality drives the design. This is a hugely impor-

member of the product team, sitting side by side with the product  
manager, and not a supporting service.

1\. Dowhateveryouneedtodotohaveyourdesignersitnexttoyou.  
2\. Include your designer from the very inception of every idea.  
3\. Include your designer in as many customer and user interactions

# The Engineers  
**I**nthischapter,Idescribetheengineeringrole\(alsocommonlyknown  
as developers or, in some circles, programmers\). But as with the last  
chapter,I’mnottryingtospeakheretotheengineers—I’maimingthis  
discussion at product managers who need to learn how to work effec-  
tively with engineers.  
There’sprobablynomoreimportantrelationshipforasuccessful

If your relationship is strong, with mutual and sincere respect  
bothways,thentheproductmanagerjobisgreat.Ifyourrelationshipis  
not strong, your days as product manager will be brutal \(and probably  
numbered\).Therefore,thisisarelationshipworthtakingveryseriously  
and doing everything you can to nurture.  
This strong relationship begins with you. You need to do your  
homework and bring to the team the knowledge and skills of good  
product management.  
Engineers are typically smart and often skeptical by nature,  
so if you’re bluffing, they likely won’t be fooled. If you don’t know  
**59** **60** INSPIRED  
something, it’s much better to fess  
up and say you’ll find out rather  
than try to bluster.  
It’s also hugely important that  
you have an actual appreciation  
for the demands and complexities  
There’s probably no more  
important relationship for a  
successful product manager  
than the one with your  
engineers.  
of the engineering job. If you were  
an engineer before or if you’ve studied computer science in school,  
you’re probably in good shape. But if not, I want to strongly encour-  
ageyoutotakeaclassatalocalcommunitycollegeoronlineeducation  
where you’ll learn a programming language.  
The purpose of developing this programming literacy is not so  
you start telling your engineers how to do their job but, rather, to  
significantly improve your ability to engage with and collaborate with  
your engineers. Less obviously, but at least as important, this knowl-  
edge will give you a much better appreciation for technology and the  
art of the possible.  
It’s also critical that you share very openly what you know about  
your customers—especially their pain—the data, and your busi-  
ness constraints. Your job is to bring this information to your  
team and then to discuss the various potential solutions to these  
problems.  
Thereisnothingwrongwithyoubringingastrongpointofview,  
but you must constantly demonstrate to your team that you’re open  
minded, you know how to listen, and you want and need their help in  
coming up with the right product.  
Asapracticalmatter,youneedtoengagedirectlywithyourengi-  
neerseveryworkday.Therearetypicallytwotypesofdiscussionsgoing

they’re working on delivering to production.  
Wherealotofproductmanagersgosidewaysisinhowtheycom-  
municatewiththeirengineers.Justasmostproductmanagersdon’tlike  
it when an executive or stakeholder spells out exactly what they want  
you to build, engineers generally don’t like it when you try to spell  
out how to build something. So, while it’s good if you have a strong The Engineers **61**  
technology understanding, it’s not good if you use that knowledge to  
try to do their jobs for them.  
You want to give your engineers as much latitude as possible in  
coming up with the best solution. Remember, they are the ones who  
will be called in the middle of the night to fix issues if they arise.  
One last thing to keep in mind\: the morale of the engineers is  
very much a function of you as the product manager. It is your job  
to make sure they feel like missionaries and not mercenaries. You do  
this by involving them deeply in the customer pain you are trying to  
solve and in the business problems you face. Don’t try to shelter them  
from this—instead, share these problems and challenges very openly  
with them. They will respect you more for it, and, in most cases, the  
developers will rise to the challenge.  
# The Tech Lead Role  
There are, of course, many different types of engineers. Some focus  
on engineering the user experience \(generally referred to as front-end  
developers\), and some focus on specific technologies \(for example,  
database, search, machine learning\).  
Similarly,aswithmostotherroles,thereisacareerprogression  
for engineers. Many go on to become senior engineers, and some go  
from there to principal engineer or architect roles. Others move into  
more of an engineering leadership path, which generally starts with  
the tech lead role \(aka dev lead, or lead engineer\).  
In general, from the product management perspective, any  
senior engineer is helpful because of the broad knowledge he or she  
brings that pertains to what is possible. However, a tech lead not  
only has this knowledge—and is responsible for helping to share this  
knowledge with the other engineers on the team—but the tech lead  
also has an explicit responsibility to help the product manager and  
product designer discover a strong solution.  
Noteveryengineerorevenseniorengineerwantstoparticipate

\(continued\) **62** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)

activities.  
It is for this reason that the product manager and product  
designer work most closely with the tech lead. In some product  
teams, there may be more than one tech lead, which is all the better.  
It’s also worth pointing out that engineers often have different  
workstyles,whichisalsotrueformanydesigners.Theproductman-

# Product Marketing  
# Managers  
**P**roduct marketing managers are a little different from the other  
members of the product team. This is not because they are any  
less important, but because the product marketing manager is usually  
not a full-time, dedicated member of each product team.  
Productmarketingismosttypicallyorganizedbycustomer-facing  
product, by target market, or sometimes by go-to-market channel,  
especially for more established companies \(e.g., enterprise, vertical,  
mid-market\). There are typically fewer product marketers than  
productteams,assuch,theygetspreadacrossdifferentproductteams.  
In the best tech product companies, product marketing plays  
an essential role in discovery, delivery, and, ultimately, go-to-market,  
which is why they are important members of the product team.

ing, the messaging, and a winning  
go-to-market plan. They are deeply engaged with the sales channel  
andknowtheircapabilities,limitations,andcurrentcompetitiveissues.  
The nature of product marketing is a bit different, depending  
on the type of business you have and how your product gets to  
market.Whenyoumakeproductsforbusinessesthataresoldthrough  
either a direct sales force or a channel sales organization, it is a very  
significant and critical job to declare the positioning—by that we  
mean the market position the product must occupy, in addition to the  
messaging—digital/contentassets,salestools,andtrainingthatenable  
sales to effectively sell.  
If your company has a sales organization, and you don’t have  
a product marketing partner, then this responsibility likely falls on  
you as product manager. This can easily become a full-time job. And  
given the cost of the sales organization, it’s really not an option to  
ignore them. But, of course, if you’re spending your day helping the  
sales organization, who is figuring out the product for these people  
to sell?  
If your company sells directly to consumers, it becomes easy for  
the marketing teams to focus on clicks and brand at the expense of  
ensuring all the product work adds up to a successfully differentiated  
market position. This is important to the long-term prospects of any  
company but also brings more meaning into all the work the product  
team does. Product Marketing Managers **65**  
It is very much in your best interest to make sure you have a  
product marketing manager to work with, and it’s absolutely worth  
yourtimetomakesureyouunderstandthemarket—andyourproduct  
marketing colleague understands the product—well enough for each  
of you to be successful.  
Therearemanyimportantinteractionsthroughoutdiscoveryand  
delivery, so it’s worth making a special effort to develop and maintain  
a strong working relationship with your product marketing colleague.  
For example, ensuring the product team is getting good signal from a  
broadenoughrepresentationofthemarket.Italsobecomesimportant  
inthemessaginganddecidingonthego-to-marketplanbasedonthese

Note here that I am talking about the modern definition of the  
product marketing role. I am not describing the old model wherein  
product marketing was responsible for defining the product, and  
product management was primarily responsible for working with  
engineering to deliver that product.  
Having a strong product marketing partner does not diminish  
in any sense the product manager’s responsibility for delivering a  
successful product. The best product marketing manager and product  
manager relationships understand their respective roles but realize  
they are essential to each other’s success. **CHAPTER**

**S**o far, we’ve talked about your role as product manager, and we’ve

# User Researchers  
As you’ll soon see when we talk about how we do product discovery,  
wearecontinuouslydoingtwokindsofrapidlearningandexperimen-  
tation.Onekindoflearningisqualitative,andtheotherisquantitative.  
Especially with the qualitative learning, some of our research is  
generative, which is understanding the problems we need to solve; and  
some of our research is evaluative, which is assessing how well our  
solutions solve the problem.  
Userresearchersaretrainedinthisrangeofqualitativetechniques  
\(and some of them are also trained on the quantitative techniques  
as well\). They can help you find the right type of users, craft the  
right types of tests, and learn the most from each user or customer  
interaction.  
The key to tapping into the real value that these user researchers  
can provide is to keep in mind that the learning must be shared learn-  
ing. You need to witness the insights first hand. More on this when we  
talk about the principles of product discovery, but while I want you to  
appreciate what user research can help you with, I don’t want you to  
think you can delegate to them to do the learning and then send you a  
report.  
If your company does not have user researchers, then your prod-  
uct designer will typically pick up these responsibilities for your team.  
# Data Analysts  
Similarly,forquantitativelearning,dataanalystshelpteamscollectthe  
right sort of analytics, manage data privacy constraints, analyze the  
data, plan live-data tests, and understand and interpret the results.  
Sometimes, data analysts go by the name business intelligence

you’ll probably need to plan to  
spend significant time diving deep into the data to understand your  
situation and make good decisions.  
# Test Automation Engineers  
Test automation engineers write automated tests for your product.  
They have largely replaced the old-style manual quality assurance  
\(QA\) people.  
Now, it’s very possible that your engineers are responsible both  
for writing software and for writing these automated tests. If that’s the  
case, then you probably won’t have many test automation engineers.  
But most companies have a blended approach in which the engineers  
writesomeoftheautomatedtests\(e.g.,theunitleveltests\),andthetest  
automation engineers write the higher-level automated tests.  
Whichever model your company has is typically up to the engi-  
neering leadership, which is fine. However, what’s not okay is if your  
company doesn’t have test engineers, and your engineers don’t do the  
testing either, and they are looking to you as product manager to do  
the quality testing.  
While it’s true as product manager you want to make sure things  
are generally as you expect before things go live \(acceptance testing\),  
that’safarcryfrombeingabletoreleasewithconfidence.Thelevelof  
test automation necessary to release with confidence is significant and

# Profile\: Jane Manning  
# of Google  
**I**’m sure you have heard of Google’s AdWords, and you may have  
also heard that this product is what fuels the Google empire. To be  
specific, as of this writing, AdWords is currently 16 years old, and in  
the most recent year alone, it generated well over \$60B in revenue.  
Yes, that’s B as in billions.  
What I’m guessing most of you don’t know, however, is just how  
this industry-defining product came to be. And especially how close  
this product came to never happening at all.  
The year was 2000, and the hardest part about the AdWords  
project was simply getting an agreement to work on it. The core idea  
had support from Larry Page, but the idea immediately encountered  
some pretty strong resistance from both the ad sales team and the  
engineering team.

**71** **72** INSPIRED  
The new sales team, under Omid Kordestani, was off to a strong  
start selling keywords to large brands and placing the results at the  
top of the search results. These results were highlighted as an ad but  
still very prominent—much in the style that had been done in search  
results at other companies, including at Netscape where Omid came  
from.Saleswasnervousthatthisideaofaself-serviceadvertisingplat-  
formwoulddiminishthevalueofwhatthesalesteamwastryingtosell  
\(known as cannibalization\).  
And the engineers, who had been working so hard to provide  
highly relevant search results, were understandably very worried that  
users would be confused and frustrated by ads getting in the way of  
their search results.  
Jane sat down with each of these people to get a deeper under-  
standing of their concerns. Some were just plain uncomfortable with  
advertising.Otherswereworriedaboutcannibalization.Andyetothers  
were concerned about potential user unhappiness.  
Once Jane understood the constraints and concerns, she had the  
information she needed to advocate for a solution that she believed  
would address the issues, yet enable countless small businesses to get  
a much more effective advertising solution. Jane also was able to per-  
suade one of Google’s earliest and most respected engineers, Georges  
Harik,oftheidea’spotential,andhehelpedtobringalongotherengi-  
neers.  
The product solution they ended up with placed the AdWords-  
generated ads to the side of the search results, so they wouldn’t be  
confused with the salesperson-sold ads, which were displayed on the  
top of the results.  
Also, instead of determining placement based solely on the  
price paid, they would use a formula that multiplied the price paid  
per impression with the ad’s performance \(click-through-rate\) to  
determineplacement,sothatthebest-performingads—theonesmost  
likely to be most relevant to users—would rise to the top, and the  
worst ads would be unlikely to be displayed at all, even if they were  
sold at a higher price.

**T**he primary job of leadership in any technology organization is to

uct company, the role goes beyond people development and into what  
we call holistic view of product.  
For a startup, there’s typically  
just one or two product teams,  
so it’s not too hard for everyone  
to keep in their heads a holis-  
tic view of the product. However,

One of the big challenges of growth is knowing how the whole  
product hangs together. Some people like to think of holistic view as  
connecting the dots between the teams.  
The three distinct but critical elements to the holistic view of  
product are described next.  
**75** **76** INSPIRED  
# Leaders of Product Management  
To ensure a holistic view of how the entire system fits together from a  
business point of view \(product vision, strategy, functionality, business  
rules, and business logic\), we need either the leaders of the product  
management organization \(VP product, directors of product\), or a  
principal product manager.  
Thispersonshouldregularlyreviewtheworkofthevariousprod-  
uct managers and product teams, identifying and helping to resolve  
conflicts.  
For large-scale organizations, some companies prefer this to be  
an individual contributor role \(e.g., a principal product manager\), but  
let me be clear that this is a very senior role \(usually equivalent to a  
director-levelmanager\).Sincetheheadofproductisfirstandforemost  
responsibleforbuildingtheskillsoftheproductmanagers,adedicated  
principal product manager is able to focus on the product itself and is  
readily accessible as a critical resource to all the product managers,  
product designers, engineers, and test automation staff.  
If you use a principal product manager for this, he or she should  
be a direct report to the head of product so that everyone understands  
the importance of the role and the responsibilities of that person.  
Whether this role is covered by the head of product or a prin-  
cipal product manager, this is a critically essential role for companies  
with large and complex business systems, especially with many legacy  
systems.  
# Leaders of Product Design  
One of the most important roles in a company is the person or people  
responsiblefortheholisticuserexperience.Theseleadersmustensure  
a consistent and effective user experience systemwide. This is some-  
times the leader of the product design team, sometimes one of the  
managers or directors of design, and sometimes a principal designer  
reports to this leader. In any case, it must be someone very strong in  
holistic product design. The Role of Leadership **77**  
There are so many interactions and interdependencies—and so  
much necessary institutional knowledge of the business and the users  
andthecustomerjourney—thatatleastonepersonmustreviewevery-  
thing going on with the product that is going to be visible to the user.  
Youcan’texpectanyindividualproductmanagerordesignertobeable  
to have this all in their head.  
# Leaders of Technology Organization  
Finally, to ensure a holistic view of how the entire system fits together  
from a technology point of view, we have a technology organization  
leader \(often titled CTO or VP engineering\). In practice, that person  
is often helped by a group of engineering managers and directors  
and/or software architects.  
The CTO, managers, and architects are responsible for the  
holisticviewofthesystemimplementation.Theyshouldbereviewing  
the architecture and systems design of all the software—both sys-  
tems developed by your own staff, as well as any systems designed  
by vendors. They should also have a clear strategy for managing  
technical debt.  
Again, this is a critically essential role for companies with large  
and complex business systems, especially with many legacy systems,  
and should be placed in the organization somewhere that makes these  
peoplevisibleandavailabletotheentiretechnologyorganization\(this  
is usually a direct report to the head of technology\).  
# Holistic View Leadership Roles  
The larger the company gets, the more critical these three roles are,  
andtheirabsenceisusuallyalltooobvious.Iftheproductorsitelooks  
like it was created by half a dozen different outside design agencies,  
with conflicting user models and poor usability, you’re probably  
missing a head of design or principal designer. **78** INSPIRED  
Ifprojectsareconstantlygettingstuckbecauseproductmanagers  
don’t understand the implications of their decisions or product man-  
agers are constantly asking developers to look at the code to tell them  
how the system really works, then you’re probably missing a principal  
product manager.  
And if your software is a big mess of spaghetti and it takes  
forever to make even simple changes, you’re probably suffering from  
significant technical debt.  
You might ask what happens if one of these people gets hit by a  
busorleavesthecompany?Firstandforemost,don’tlosethesepeople!  
Take care of them and don’t give them any reason to want to leave or  
feel like they need to become a manager to make more money.  
Second, you should always be trying to develop more of these  
people,andeachofthemshouldhaveatleastonepersonthey’rework-

# Competencies  
Specifically, you are looking for someone who is proved to be strong  
in four key competencies\: \(1\) team development, \(2\) product vision,  
\(3\) execution, and \(4\) product culture.  
# Team Development  
The single most important respon-  
sibility of any VP product is to

uct managers and designers. This  
means making recruiting, train-  
ing, and ongoing coaching the top

strong team of product  
managers.  
priority. Realize that developing  
great people requires a different set of skills than developing great  
products,whichiswhymanyotherwiseexcellentproductmanagersand  
designers never progress to leading organizations.  
One of the worst things you can do is take one of your  
poor-performing people and promote them to this leadership posi-  
tion. I know that may sound obvious, but you’d be surprised how  
many execs reason, “Well, this person is not very strong, but he works  
well with people, and the stakeholders seem to like him, so maybe I’ll  
makehimtheheadofproductandhireastrongindividualcontributor  
to backfill him.” But how do you expect this poor performer to help  
develop his or her team into strong performers? And what message  
does this send to the organization?  
For this position, you need to ensure you hire someone who has  
proven ability to develop others. They should have a track record of The Head of Product Role **81**  
identifying and recruiting potential talent, and then working actively  
and continuously with those people to address their weaknesses and  
exploit their strengths.  
# Product Vision and Strategy  
Theproductvisioniswhatdrivesandinspiresthecompanyandsustains  
thecompanythroughtheupsanddowns.Thismaysoundstraightfor-  
ward, but it’s tricky. That’s because there are two very different types  
of product leaders needed for two very different situations\:  
1\. Where there is a CEO or a founder who is the clear product  
visionary  
2\. Where there is no clear product visionary—usually in situations  
where the founder has moved on  
There are two very bad situations you may encounter related to  
product vision and strategy.  
The first is when you have a CEO who is very strong at product  
and vision, but she wants to hire a VP product \(or, more often, the  
board pushes her to hire a VP product\), and she thinks she should be  
hiring someone in her own image—or at least visionary like her. The  
result is typically an immediate clash and a short tenure for the VP  
product. If this position looks like a revolving door, it’s very possible  
that’s what’s going on.  
ThesecondbadsituationiswhentheCEOisnotstrongatvision,  
butshealsohiressomeoneinherownimage.Thisdoesn’tresultinthe  
clash \(they often get along great\), but it does leave a serious void in  
terms of vision, and this causes frustration among the product teams,  
poor morale across the company, and usually a lack of innovation.  
ThekeyhereisthattheVPproductneedstocomplement theCEO.  
If you have a strong, visionary CEO, there may be some very strong  
VPproductcandidatesthatwon’twantthepositionbecausetheyknow  
that, in this company, their job is primarily to execute the vision of  
the CEO.  
One situation that unfortunately happens is when you have a  
visionary founder CEO, and she has a solid partner running product **82** INSPIRED  
who is very strong at execution, but the founder eventually leaves  
and now the company has a problem because nobody is there to  
provide the vision for the future. It’s generally not something a VP  
product can easily turn on and off, and even if they can, the rest of  
the company may not be willing to consider the product leader in this  
new light. This is why I generally prefer when the founders stay on at  
the company, even if they decide they want to bring in someone else  
as the CEO.

ary, but also has the ability and willingness to convince the CEO the  
vision was all her idea.  
# Execution  
Nomatterwherethevisioncomesfrom,allthegreatvisionintheworld  
doesn’t mean much if you can’t get the product idea into the hands of  
customers. You need a product leader who knows how to get things  
done and has absolutely proved her ability to do so.  
There are many aspects that contribute to a team’s ability to  
execute consistently, rapidly, and effectively. The product leader  
should be expert on modern forms of product planning, customer  
discovery, product discovery, and product development process, but  
execution also means that they know how to work effectively as part  
of an organization of your size.  
Thebiggertheorganization,themorecriticalitisthattheperson  
has proven, strong skills—especially in stakeholder management and  
internal evangelism. The product leader must be able to inspire and  
motivatethecompanyandgeteveryonemovinginthesamedirection.  
# Product Culture  
Good product organizations have a strong team, a solid vision, and  
consistentexecution.Agreat productorganizationaddsthedimension  
of a strong product culture.  
A strong product culture means that the team understands  
the importance of continuous and rapid testing and learning. The Head of Product Role **83**  
They understand that they need to make mistakes in order to learn,  
but they need to make them quickly and mitigate the risks. They  
understand the need for continuous innovation. They know that  
great products are the result of true collaboration. They respect and  
value their designers and engineers. They understand the power of a  
motivated product team.  
A strong VP product will understand the importance of a strong  
product culture, be able to give real examples of her own experiences  
withproductculture,andhaveconcreteplansforinstillingthisculture  
in your company.  
# Experience  
The amount of relevant experience, such as domain experience, will  
depend on your particular company and industry. But at a minimum,  
youarelookingforsomeonewiththecombinationofastrongtechnol-  
ogybackgroundwithanunderstandingoftheeconomicsanddynamics  
of your business and your market.  
# Chemistry  
Last but certainly not least, everything previously discussed is still not  
enough. There is one more thing\: Your product leader must be able  
to work well on a personal level with the other key execs, especially  
the CEO and CTO. It will not be fun for any of you if there isn’t  
that personal connection. Make sure the interview process includes a  
long dinner with at least the CEO and CTO and probablythe head of  
marketing and head of design. Be open and make it personal.  
# The Group Product Manager Role  
There’s a role in larger product organizations that I find especially  
effective. The role is titled group product manager, usually referred to  
as GPM.  
The GPM is a hybrid role. Part individual contributor and  
part first-level people manager. The idea is that the GPM is already  
\(continued\) **84** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
a proven product manager \(usually coming from a senior product  
manager title\), and now the person is ready for more responsibility.  
There are generally two career paths for product managers.  
One is to stay as an individual contributor, which, if you’re  
strongenough,cangoallthewayuptoaprincipal product manager—a  
person who’s an individual contributor but a rock-star performer and  
willing and able to tackle the toughest product work. This is a very  
highly regarded role and generally compensated like a director or  
even VP.  
The other path is to move into functional management of  
the product managers \(the most common title is director of product  
management\) where some number of product managers \(usually  
somewherebetween3and10\)reportdirectlytoyou.Thedirectorof  
product management is really responsible for two things. The first  
is ensuring his or her product managers are all strong and capable.  
The second is product vision and strategy and connecting the dots  
betweentheproductworkofthemanyteams.Thisisalsoreferredto  
as holistic view of product.  
But lots of strong senior product managers are not sure about  
their preferred career path at this stage, and the GPM role is a great  
way to get a taste of both worlds.  
TheGPMistheactual product managerforoneproduct team,  
but in addition, she is responsible for the development and coaching  
of a small number of additional product managers \(typically, one to  
three others\).  
While the director of product management may have product  
managers who work across many different areas, the GPM model is  
designed to facilitate tightly coupled product teams.  
This is easiest to explain with an example.  
Let’s say you’re a growth stage marketplace company, and you  
have roughly 10 product teams. You may likely have those 10 teams  
splitupintothreetypes\:aplatform/commonservicesgroup,andthen  
agroupforeachsideofthemarketplace\(e.g.,buyersandsellers,riders  
and drivers, or hosts and guests\).

TheremightbeoneVPproductandthreeGPMs—oneforeach  
ofthethreegroups,forexample,aGPMofbuyerside,aGPMofseller  
side, and a GPM of platform services.  
So now let’s drill in on the GPM for buyer side, and let’s say  
there are three product teams comprising the buyer-side experience.  
The GPM of buyer side would have one of those teams, and each of  
the other two teams would have a product manager that reports to  
the GPM.  
We like this because the buyer side really needs to be one  
seamless solution, even though there may be multiple product teams  
working on different aspects of it. The GPM works very closely with  
the other PMs to ensure this.  
This role is often called a player-coach role because of this  
dynamic of leading your own team, in addition to being responsible  
for coaching and developing one to three other PMs.  
Some GPMs go on to

# The Head of Technology Role  
**E**ven with the greatest product ideas, if you can’t build and launch  
yourproduct,itremainsjustanidea.So,yourrelationshipwiththe  
engineering organization is all important.  
Inthischapter,Idescribetheleaderoftheengineeringorganiza-  
tion. I had the good fortune to collaborate on this chapter with one of  
Silicon Valley’s most successful CTOs, Chuck Geiger.  
Ihaveoftensaidthat,ifasproductmanageryouhaveagoodwork-  
ingrelationshipwithyourengineeringcounterpart,thenthisisagreat  
job. If you don’t, you’re in for some very tough days. So, in the spirit  
of developing a better appreciation for what makes a great technology  
organization, we offer this summary.  
First, let’s be clear which organization we’re referring to. This  
is the organization responsible for architecture, engineering, quality,  
siteoperations,sitesecurity,releasemanagement, and usuallydelivery  
management. This group is responsible for building and running the  
company’s products and services.  
The titles vary but often include VP engineering, or chief tech-  
nology officer \(CTO\). In this chapter, we’ll refer to the head of this  
**87** **88** INSPIRED  
organization as the CTO, but feel  
free to substitute the term your  
company uses.  
There is one title, however,  
that is often a problem\: the chief  
information officer \(CIO\). The  
Even with the greatest  
product ideas, if you can’t  
build and launch your  
product, it remains just  
an idea.  
CIO role is very different from the  
CTO role. In fact, if your technology organization reports to the  
CIO, that is a warning flag for many of the pathologies discussed  
in Chapter 6, “The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts.”  
The hallmark of a great CTO is a commitment to continually  
strive for technology as a strategic enabler for the business and the  
products. Removing technology as a barrier, as well as broadening the  
art of the possible for business and product leaders, is the overarching  
objective.  
To that end, there are six major responsibilities of a CTO. We  
present them here in priority order and discuss how each is typically  
measured.  
# Organization  
Build an excellent organization with a strong management team  
committed to developing the skills of your employees. We typically  
measure effectiveness here by looking at development plans for all the  
employees, the retention rate, and the evaluation of the managers and  
the overall product and technology organization by the rest of the  
company.  
# Leadership  
Represent technology in the overall strategic direction and leadership  
ofthecompany,workingwithothercompanyexecutivestohelpinform  
direction, M&A activity, and build/buy/partner decisions. The Head of Technology Role **89**  
# Delivery  
Make sure this organization can rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly  
deliver quality product to market. There are several measures of  
delivery, including the consistency and frequency of release vehicles,  
and the quality/reliability of the delivered/launched software. The  
main obstacle to rapid delivery is often technical debt, and it is the  
responsibility of the CTO to ensure that the company is keeping this  
at a manageable level and not allowing the problem to cripple the  
organization’s ability to deliver and compete, which is discussed next.  
# Architecture  
Make sure the company has an architecture capable of delivering the  
functionality, scalability, reliability, security and performance it needs  
to compete and thrive. In companies that have multiple product lines  
or vertical business units, the CTO needs to be the leader in a cohe-  
sive technology strategy looking at the sum, and not just the parts.  
The CTO is the orchestrator of a company-wide technology strategy.  
The measures for architecture will vary based on your business, but in  
general,welooktoensurethattheinfrastructureiscontinuouslymon-  
itored and advanced to keep pace with the growth of the business, and  
we measure outages that impact our customers that are due to infras-  
tructure or architectural issues.  
# Discovery  
Make sure that members of the senior engineering staff are partic-  
ipating actively and contributing significantly throughout product  
discovery.Ifyourengineersandarchitectsareonlybeingusedtowrite  
software, then you are only getting a fraction of the value from them  
you should be. We encourage you to keep an eye on the participation  
of the engineering organization in product discovery \(both duration **90** INSPIRED  
and coverage\) and follow the frequency of innovations credited to the  
engineering participant.  
# Evangelism

# The Delivery Manager Role  
In growth-stage and enterprise companies, many product managers  
complain that they have to spend far too much of their time doing  
project management activities. As a result, they have almost no time  
to address their primary product responsibility\: ensuring that the  
engineers have a product worth building.  
Delivery managers are a special type of project manager  
whose mission is all about removing obstacles—also known as impedi-  
ments—fortheteam.Sometimes,theseobstaclesinvolveotherproduct  
teams, and sometimes they involve non-product functions. In a single  
day, they might track down someone in marketing and press them  
for a decision or an approval, coordinate with the delivery manager  
on another team about prioritizing a key dependency, persuade a  
product designer to create some visual assets for one of the front-end  
developers, and deal with a dozen other similar roadblocks.

**91** In growth-stage and  
enterprise companies, many  
product managers complain  
that they have to spend far  
too much of their time  
doing project management  
activities.  
**92** INSPIRED  
These people might have  
the title project manager—or  
sometimes program manager—but  
if that’s the case, then we need  
to make sure these people have  
defined the job like I did here and  
not in the old program manage-  
ment sense.  
If your company does not  
have delivery managers—by what-  
ever title—then this work typically falls to the product manager and  
the engineering managers. Again, if your organization is small, then  
this is fine—and there are even advantages. But if your organization is  
larger—on the order of at least 5 to 10 product teams, then this role  
becomes increasingly important. **CHAPTER**

# Principles of Structuring  
# Product Teams  
**O**ne of the most difficult issues facing every product organization  
at scale is just how to split up your product across your many  
product teams.  
The need to split up your product starts to show up with just  
a few product teams, but at scale—25, 50, more than 100 product  
teams—this becomes a very substantial factor in the company’s  
ability to move quickly. It’s also a significant factor in keeping teams  
feeling empowered and accountable for something meaningful, yet  
contributingtoabiggervisionwherethesumisgreaterthantheparts.  
If you are already at scale, then I’m certain you know what I’m  
talking about.  
Whatmakesthissuchadifficulttopicisthatthereisnooneright  
answer. There are many considerations and factors, and good product  
companies debate the alternatives and then make a decision.

**94** INSPIRED  
I have personally worked with  
manyproductandtechnologyorga-  
nizations as they considered the  
options, and for many of those,  
I’ve been able to watch how things  
worked out over time.  
Iknowthatmanypeoplecrave  
justhowtosplitupyour

productteams.  
a recipe for structuring product  
teams, but I always explain to them that there is no recipe. Instead,  
there are some critical core principles, and the key is to under-  
stand those principles and then weigh the options for your particular  
circumstances.  
1\. Alignment with investment strategy  
It’sremarkabletome howmanycompaniesI findinwhich  
the teams are simply reflections of their ongoing investments.  
They have certain teams because they have always had those  
teams. But, of course, we need to be investing in our future as  
well. We can phase out products that no longer carry their own  
weight,andwecanoftenreducetheinvestmentsinourcash-cow  
products so that we can invest more in future sources of rev-  
enue and growth. There are any number of ways to think about  
spreadingoutyourinvestmentsovertimeandrisk.Somepeople  
like the three horizons model, while others take more of a port-  
folio management approach. The point here is that you need to  
have an investment strategy, and your team structure should be  
a reflection of that.  
2\. Minimize Dependencies  
A big goal is to minimize dependencies. This helps teams  
move faster and feel much more autonomous. While we can  
never entirely eliminate dependencies, we can work to reduce  
and minimize them. Also note that dependencies change over  
time, so track them continuously and always ask yourself how  
they can be reduced.  
3\. Ownership and Autonomy  
Remember that one of the most important traits of prod-  
uct teams is that we want teams of missionaries and not teams Principles of Structuring Product Teams **95**  
ofmercenaries.Thisleadsdirectlytotheconceptsofownership  
and autonomy. A team should feel empowered, yet accountable  
for some significant part of the product offering. This is harder  
than it sounds because large systems don’t always slice up so  
cleanly.Somelevelofinterdependencieswillalwayschipawayat  
thesenseofownership.Butweworkhardtotrytomaximizethis.  
4\. Maximize Leverage  
As organizations grow, we often find common needs and  
the increased importance of shared services. We do this for  
speed and reliability. We don’t want every team reinventing  
the wheel. Realize, however, that creating shared services also  
creates dependencies and can impinge on autonomy.  
5\. Product Vision and Strategy  
The product vision describes where we as an organization  
are trying to go, and the product strategy describes the major  
milestonestogetthere.Manylargerandolderorganizationsno  
longer have a relevant vision and strategy, but this is key. Once  
you have your vision and strategy, ensure you have structured  
the teams to be well positioned to deliver on them.  
6\. Team Size  
This is a very practical principle. The minimum size for a  
product team is usually two engineers and a product manager,  
and if the team is responsible for user-facing technology, then a  
product designer is needed, too. Fewer than that is considered  
below critical mass for a product team. On the other end, it’s  
reallydifficultforoneproductmanagerandproductdesignerto  
keep more than about 10–12 engineers busy with good stuff to  
build.Also,incaseit’snotclear,it’simportantthateachproduct  
team have one, and only one, product manager.  
7\. Alignment with Architecture  
In practice, for many organizations the primary principle  
for structuring the product teams is the architecture. Many will  
start with the product vision, come up with an architectural  
approach to deliver on that vision, and then design the teams  
around that architecture. **96** INSPIRED  
That may sound backward to you, but in truth there are  
some really good reasons for this. Architectures drive technolo-  
gies,whichdriveskillsets.Whilewe’dloveforeveryteamtobe  
a full stack team that can work on any layer of the architecture,  
in practice that’s often not an option. Different engineers are  
trained in different technologies. Some want to specialize \(and,  
in fact, have in many cases spent many years specializing\), and  
some are years away from having the necessary skills. Architec-  
ture does not change quickly.  
It’s usually easy to see when a company has not paid atten-  
tion to the architecture when they assemble their teams—it  
shows up a few different ways. First, the teams feel like they are  
constantly fighting the architecture. Second, interdependencies  
betweenteamsseemdisproportionate.Third,andreallybecause  
of the first two, things move slowly, and teams don’t feel very  
empowered.  
For larger companies, especially, it’s typical to have one or  
more teams that provide common services to the other product  
teams.Weoftenlabeltheseteamscommonservices,coreservices,or  
platformteams, but they primarily reflect the architecture. This  
isveryhigh-highleverage,whichiswhysomanycompanieshave  
thesetypesofteamsatscale.However,itisalsoadifficulttypeof  
team to staff because these teams are dependencies \(by design\)  
ofalltheotherteams,astheyaretheretoenabletheotherteams.  
Be sure to staff these common services teams with strong and  
highly technical product managers \(often called platformproduct  
managers\).  
8\. Alignment with User or Customer  
Aligning with the user and customer has very real benefits  
fortheproductandfortheteam.If,forexample,yourcompany  
provides a two-sided marketplace with buyers on one side and  
sellers on the other, there are real advantages to having some  
teams focus on buyers and others focus on sellers. Each prod-  
uct team can go very deep with their type of customers rather  
than have them try to learn about all types of customers. Even  
in marketplace companies, however, they will invariably have  
somenumberofteamsthatprovidethecommonfoundationand Principles of Structuring Product Teams **97**  
shared services to all the teams. This is really a reflection of the  
architecture, so the point here is that it is perfectly fine—and  
usual—to have both types of teams.  
9\. Alignment with Business  
In larger companies, we often have multiple lines of  
business but a common foundation for our products. If the  
technology is truly independent across businesses, then we’d  
justtreatthemasessentiallydifferentcompaniesaswestructure  
product teams. However, mostly that’s not the case. We have  
multiple lines of business, but all are built on a common and  
often integrated foundation. This is roughly similar to aligning  
by customer type, but there are important differences. Our  
business unit structure is an artificial construct. The different  
business units are often selling to the same actual customers.  
So, while there are advantages to aligning with business units,  
this usually comes after the other factors in priority.  
10\. Structure Is a Moving Target  
Realizethattheoptimalstructureoftheproductorganiza-  
tionisamovingtarget.Theorganization’sneedsshouldandwill  
change over time. It’s not like you’ll need to reorganize every  
few months, but reviewing your team structure every year or so  
makes sense.  
I often have to explain to companies that there is never a  
perfect way to structure a team—every attempt at structuring  
theproductorganizationwillbeoptimizedforsomethingsatthe  
expense of others. So, as with most things in product and tech-  
nology, it involves tradeoffs and choices. My hope is that these  
principleswillhelpyouasyouguideyourorganizationforward.  
# Autonomy @ Scale  
Most leading tech companies have jumped on the empowered, ded-  
icated/durable, cross-functional, collaborative product team model I  
have described here, and I think they are much better for it.  
\(continued\) **98** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
Theresultsspeakforthemselves,butIattributemostoftheben-  
efits to the increased level of motivation and true sense of ownership  
when teams feel more in control of their own destiny.  
However, while most  
leaders tell me they have em-  
powered, autonomous teams,  
some of the people on those  
teams complain to me that  
they don’t always feel so  
empowered or autonomous.  
Iattributemostofthe  
benefitstotheincreased  
levelofmotivationandtrue  
senseofownershipwhen  
teamsfeelmoreincontrol  
oftheirowndestiny.  
Whenever this happens, I try  
to get to the specifics of just what it is that the team is not able to  
decide or where they feel constrained.  
Most of what I hear falls into one of two cases\:  
1\. In the first case, the team simply isn’t trusted yet by manage-  
ment, and management is reluctant to give too long of a rope  
to the team.  
2\. In the second case, the team wants to change something that  
the leaders had assumed was part of the foundation.  
Ingeneral,mostteamswouldprobablyagreethattherearesome  
things that are wide open for the team to do as they think best and  
other areas that are part of the common foundation that all teams  
share.  
As an example of the latter, it would be unusual for each team  
to select its own software configuration management tool. If the  
engineering team has standardized on GitHub, then that is usually  
considered part of the foundation. Even if one team had a strong  
preference for a different tool, the total cost to the organization of  
allowing its use would likely far outweigh any benefits.  
While this might be a straightforward example, there are many  
others that are not so clear.  
\(continued\) Principles of Structuring Product Teams **99**  
\(continued\)  
Forexample,shouldeachteambeabletoapproachtestautoma-

Whataboutbrowsercompatibility?Howaboutexpensivefeatureslike  
offline support? How about the flavor of Agile they wish to use? And  
doeseveryteamreallyneedtosupportseveralcompany-wideproduct  
initiatives?  
As is so often the case with product, things boil down to a  
tradeoff—in this case between the team’s autonomy and leverage of  
the foundation.  
I will also confess here that, while I love the core notion of  
autonomous, empowered teams, I am also a big fan of investing in  
ahigh-leveragefoundation.Thismeansbuildingastrongfoundation  
thatallteamscanleveragetocreateamazingproductsandexperiences  
much faster than they would otherwise.  
For the record, I do not believe that there is one answer to this  
question.Thebestanswerisdifferentforeachcompany,andevenfor  
each team, and the best answer is also a function of the company’s  
culture.  
Here are the key factors to consider\:  
# Team Skill Level  
Thereareroughlythreeteamskilllevels\:\(1\)Ateam—anexperienced  
team that can be entrusted to make good choices; \(2\) B team—these  
people have the right intentions but may not have the level of expe-  
rience necessary to make good decisions in many cases and may need  
some assistance; and \(3\) C team—this is a junior team that may not  
evenknowwhattheydon’tknowyet.Theseteamscanunintentionally  
cause substantial issues without significant coaching.  
# Importance of Speed  
One of the main arguments for leverage is speed. The logic goes  
that teams should be able to build on the work of their colleagues  
\(continued\) **100** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
and not spend time reinventing the wheel. However, sometimes it’s  
simply an accepted and acknowledged cost of empowerment to allow  
teams to potentially duplicate areas or proceed slower in the name of  
autonomy. Other times, the viability of the business depends on this  
leverage.  
# Importance of Integration  
In some companies, the portfolio is a set of related, but largely inde-  
pendent,productsinwhichintegrationandleverageislessimportant.  
In other companies, the portfolio is about a set of highly integrated  
products in which integration leverage is critical. This boils down  
to whether the team should optimize for its particular solution or  
optimize for the company as a whole.  
# Source of Innovation  
If the main sources of future innovation are necessary at the foun-  
dation level, then there will need to be more freedom for teams  
to revisit core components. If the main sources of innovation are  
expected to be at the solution level, then the company needs to  
encourage less revisiting of the foundation and, instead, focus the  
creativity on application-level innovations.  
# Company Size and Locations  
Manyoftheproblematicissueswithautonomyarisebecauseofissues  
of scale. As companies grow, and especially as companies have teams  
in disperse locations, leverage becomes both more important and  
moredifficult.Somecompaniestrytodealwiththiswiththecenterof  
excellenceconcept in which leverage is focused on teams in a physical  
location. Others try stronger holistic roles. Yet others add process.  
# Company Culture  
It is also important to acknowledge the role that an emphasis on  
autonomy versus leverage plays in team culture. The further on  
the spectrum that the company pushes toward leverage, the more  
\(continued\) Principles of Structuring Product Teams **101**  
\(continued\)  
this can be perceived by the teams as chipping away at their level of  
autonomy.ThismaybeacceptableforB-andC-levelteamsbutmore  
problematic for A-level teams.  
# Maturity of Technology  
One frequent problem is to try to standardize on a common founda-  
tionprematurely.Thefoundationisn’tyetreadyforprimetime,inthe  
senseoftheleverageitisdesignedtoprovide.Ifyoupushtoohardon  
leverage before the foundation is ready, you can truly hurt the teams  
thatarecountingonthisfoundation.You’rebuildingahouseofcards  
that may collapse at any time.  
# Importance to Business  
Assuming the foundation is solid, there’s likely more risk in a team  
not leveraging that foundation. This might be fine for some areas,  
but withproducts orinitiativesthat arebusinesscritical,itbecomes a  
question of which battles to pick.  
# Level of Accountability  
Another factor is the level of accountability that goes along with the  
empowermentandautonomy.Ifthere’snoaccountability—andespe-  
cially if you don’t have strong A teams—there’s little reason for the  
teamstostressaboutthesetradeoffs.Butyouwanttheteamstostress  
over these tradeoffs. If I believe the team is strong and they fully  
understand the consequences and risks, and yet they still feel they  
need to replace a key component of the foundation, then I tend to  
side with that team.  
Asyoucansee,therearenolackofconsiderationsinthetradeoff  
between autonomy and leveraging the foundation. But, I find if you  
discuss these topics openly, most teams are reasonable. Sometimes,  
justafewkeyquestionsaboutsomeoftheimplicationscanhelpteams  
make better decisions regarding this tradeoff.  
\(continued\) **102** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
If you find that teams are consistently making poor decisions  
in this regard, you may need to consider the experience level of the  
people on the team, but most likely, the teams are missing the full  
business context.  
The critical context is comprised of two things\:  
1\. The overall product vision  
2\. The specific business objectives assigned to each team

More generally, Lea knew that the upgrade model was pushing  
the company to take the product in directions that were not good for  
AdobecustomersandnotgoodinthelongtermforAdobe.Butchange  
of this magnitude—revenue from Creative Suite was roughly half of  
Adobe’s overall \$4 billion in annual revenue—is brutally hard.  
Realize that every bone and muscle in the corporate body works  
to protect that revenue, and so a transition of this magnitude means  
pushing the company far outside it’s comfort zone. Finance, legal,  
marketing, sales, technology—few in the company would be left  
untouched.  
You can start with the typical concerns\:  
The finance staff was very worried about the revenue conse-  
quences of moving from a license model to a subscription model.  
The engineering teams were worried about moving from a  
two-year release train model to continuous development and deploy-  
ment,especiallywhileassuringquality.Theywerealsoconcernedthat

this change, the sales organization knew that this was risky because  
if things didn’t work out well, the channels would probably not be  
forgiving.  
And don’t underestimate the emotional changes—to both cus-  
tomers and sales staff—of moving from owning software to renting  
access to software. Profile\: Lea Hickman of Adobe **105**  
With more than a million customers of the existing Creative  
Suite, Lea understood the technology adoption curve and that a  
segment of the customer base would strongly resist a change of this  
magnitude. Lea understood that it’s not just about whether the new  
Creative Cloud would be better, it would also be different in some  
meaningful ways. Some people would need more time to digest this  
change than others.  
RealizealsothattheCreativeSuiteis,asthenameimplies,asuite  
of integration applications—15 major ones and many smaller utilities.  
So, this meant that not just one product had to transform, but the full  
suite needed to transform, which dramatically increased the risk and  
complexity. It is any wonder that few companies are willing to tackle a  
product transformation of this magnitude?  
Lea knew she had a tough job in front of her and her teams. She  
realized that, for all of these interrelated pieces to be able to move  
togetherinparallel,sheneededtoarticulateclearlyacompellingvision  
of the new whole as greater than the sum of the parts.  
Lea worked with Adobe’s then-CTO, Kevin Lynch, to put  
together some compelling prototypes showing the power of this new  
foundation and used this to rally executives and product teams.  
Lea then began a sustained and exhausting campaign to com-  
municate continuously with leaders and stakeholders across the entire  
company. To Lea, there was no such thing as over-communication. A  
continuousstreamofprototypeshelpedkeeppeopleexcitedaboutwhat  
this new future would bring.  
Because of the tremendous success of the Creative Cloud—as of  
this writing, Adobe generated more than \$1 billion in recurring rev-  
enue faster than anyone else has—Adobe discontinued new releases of  
the desktop-based Creative Suite to focus their innovation on the new  
foundation.Today,morethan9millioncreativeprofessionalssubscribe  
to, and depend on, the Creative Cloud. Thanks, in large part to this  
transition, Adobe has more than tripled the market cap it had before  
the transition. The company today is worth roughly \$60 billion.  
It’s easy to see how big companies with lots of revenue at risk  
would hesitate to make the changes they need to not only survive but  
thrive. Lea tackled these concerns and more head-on with a clear and  
compelling vision and strategy and clear and continuous communica-  
tion to the many stakeholders. **106** INSPIRED

# Product Roadmaps  
# Overview  
Nowthatwe’vegotsomestrongproductteams,weneedtoanswerthis  
fundamental question\: What should our product team work on?  
For most companies \(especially those described in Chapter 6,  
“The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts”\), that’s not a question  
the teams have to worry much about because they are usually handed  
down the things to work on in the form of a product roadmap.  
Oneofthekeythemesofthisbookisfocusingonoutcome andnot  
output. Realize that typical product roadmaps are all about output. Yet,  
good teams are asked to deliver business results.  
Most of the product world has the same definition for product  
roadmap, but there are a few variations. I define product roadmap as a  
prioritized list of features and projects your team has been asked to work  
on.Theseproductroadmapsareusuallydoneonaquarterlybasis,but  
sometimes they are a rolling three months, and some companies do  
annual roadmaps.  
In some cases, product roadmaps come down from management  
\(usually referred to as a stakeholder-driven roadmap\) and sometimes the  
roadmapcomesfromtheproductmanager.Theydon’tusuallyinclude  
little things like bugs and optimizations, but they do normally contain  
therequestedfeatures,projects,andbig,multi-teameffortsoftencalled  
initiatives. And they typically include due dates or at least time frames  
for when each item is expected to be delivered.  
Management knows that many parts of the company need things  
from the product organization; yet, we are rarely staffed to be able to  
do everything that’s needed. So, management may help mediate this failed efforts in product  
organizations.  
Product Roadmaps **109**  
battle over the constrained re-  
sources. That’s where stakeholder-  
driven roadmaps are especially  
common.  
Management has fair reasons  
for wanting product roadmaps\:  
Typical roadmaps are the  
root cause of most waste and  
• First, they want to be sure you’re working on the highest-value  
things first.  
• Second,theyaretryingtorunabusiness,whichmeanstheyneed  
to be able to plan. They want to know when key capabilities will  
launch so they can coordinate marketing programs, sales force  
hiring, dependencies with partners, and so on.  
These are reasonable desires. Yet, typical roadmaps are the root  
cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations.

let’s consider the alternatives. **CHAPTER**

inconvenient truths about product.  
The first inconvenient truth is that at least half of our product  
ideasarejustnotgoingtowork.Therearemanyreasonsforaproduct  
idea to not pan out.  
Sometimes customers just aren’t as excited about this idea as we  
are,sotheychoosenot touseitorbuyit\(thevalue isn’tthere\).Thisis  
the most common situation.  
Sometimestheydowanttouseit,andtheytrytouseit,butit’sso  
complicated that it’s simply more trouble than it’s worth, which yields  
the same result—the users don’t use it \(the usability isn’t there\).  
Sometimestheissueisthatthecustomersmighthavelovedit,but  
it turns out to be much more involved to build than we first thought,  
and we simply can’t afford the time and cost to deliver \(the feasibility  
isn’t there\).  
**111** **112** INSPIRED  
And, sometimes the issue is  
that we encounter serious legal,  
financial, or business constraints  
that block the solution from launch  
\(the business viability isn’t there\).  
If that’s not bad enough, the  
second inconvenient truth is that,  
even with the ideas that do prove  
to be valuable, usable, feasible, and  
The issue is that anytime  
you put a list of ideas on a  
document entitled  
“roadmap,” no matter how  
many disclaimers you put  
on it, people across the  
company will interpret the  
items as a commitment.  
viable,ittypicallytakesseveral itera-  
tions to get the execution of this idea to the point where it delivers the  
expectedbusinessvaluethatmanagementwashopingfor.Thisisoften  
referred to as time to money.  
In my experience, there simply is no escaping these inconvenient  
truths. And I’ve had the opportunity to work with many truly excep-  
tional product teams. The difference is how product teams deal with  
these truths.  
Weakteamsjustplodthroughtheroadmapthey’vebeenassigned,  
month after month. And, when something doesn’t work—which is  
often—firsttheyblameitonthestakeholderthatrequested/demanded  
the feature and then they try to schedule another iteration on the  
roadmap, or they suggest a redesign or a different set of features that  
this time they hope will solve the problem.  
Iftheyhaveenoughtimeandmoney,theycaneventuallygetthere  
so long as management doesn’t run out of patience first \(a big if\).  
In contrast, strong product teams understand these truths and  
embrace them rather than deny them. They are very good at quickly  
tackling the risks \(no matter where that idea originated\) and are fast  
at iterating to an effective solution. This is what product discovery is  
allabout,anditiswhyIviewproductdiscoveryasthemostimportant  
core competency of a product organization.  
If we can prototype and test ideas with users, customers, engi-  
neers, and business stakeholders in hours and days—rather than in  
weeksand months—it changesthe dynamics,and most important, the  
results.  
It’sworthpointingoutthatitisn’tthelistofideasontheroadmap

Don’t misinterpret this. Sometimes, we do need to commit to a

# The Alternative  
# to Roadmaps  
**I**n this chapter, I describe the alternative to product roadmaps. It’s a  
big topic, and it touches on issues beyond product roadmaps, such  
asproductculture,morale,empowerment,autonomy,andinnovation.  
Butmyhopeistolaythefoundationhereandprovidethedetailsinthe  
chapters that follow.  
Beforewejumpintothealternative,however,weneedtoremind  
ourselvesthatroadmapshaveexistedforsolongbecausetheyservetwo  
purposes, and these needs don’t go away\:  
• The first purpose is because the management of the com-  
pany wants to make sure that teams are working on the  
highest-business-value items first.  
• The second purpose is because—since they’re trying to run a  
business—there are cases where they need to make date-based  
commitments,andtheroadmapiswheretheyseeandtrackthose  
**115** **116** INSPIRED  
commitments \(even though in most companies, they rarely trust  
the dates anymore\).  
So,tobeacceptedinmostcompanies,anyalternativeapproachto  
roadmapsmustaddresstheseneedsatleastaswellastheyareaddressed  
today.  
In the empowered product team model this book is predicated  
on, the teams are themselves equipped to figure out the best ways to  
solvetheparticularbusinessproblemsassignedtothem.Butforthisto  
happen, it’s not enough to have strong people equipped with modern  
tools and techniques. The product teams need to have the necessary  
businesscontext. They need to have a solid understanding of where the  
company is heading, and they need to know how their particular team  
is supposed to contribute to the larger purpose.  
For technology companies, there are two main components that  
provide this business context\:  
1\. The product vision and strategy. Thisdescribesthebigpicture  
of what the organization as a whole is trying to accomplish and  
what the plan is for achieving that vision. Each of our product  
teams may have its own areas of focus \(for example, buyer teams  
andsellerteams\),butit’sallsupposedtocometogethertoachieve  
the product vision.  
2\. The business objectives. This describesthe specific,prioritized  
business objectives for each product team.  
The idea behind business objectives is simple enough\: tell the  
team what you need them to accomplish and how the results will  
be measured, and let the team figure out the best way to solve the  
problems.  
Consider this example of a business objective and a measurable,  
key result. Suppose your product currently requires 30 days for a new  
customer to onboard. But in order to scale effectively, management  
believes this needs to be reduced to three hours or less.  
That’s a good example of a business objective for one or more  
product teams\: “Dramatically reduce the time it takes for a new cus-  
tomer to go live.” And one of the measurable key results would be  
“Average new customer onboarding time less than three hours.”  
I’ll describe much more about product vision and strategy—and  
business objectives—in the upcoming chapters. But for now I want to The Alternative to Roadmaps **117**  
emphasize how important it is for  
each and every product team to  
know how their work contributes  
to the larger whole and what the  
company needs them to focus on  
right now.  
Itismanagement’s  
responsibilitytoprovide  
eachproductteamwiththe  
specificbusinessobjectives  
theyneedtotackle.  
Earlier, I said we needed to  
acknowledge the two drivers for  
old-style roadmaps, and the first driver is the desire to work on the  
highest business value items first.  
In the model I’m describing, it is management’s responsibility  
to provide each product team with the specific business objectives  
they need to tackle. The difference is that they are now prioritizing  
business results, rather than product ideas. And, yes, it is more than a  
little ironic that we sometimes need to convince management to focus  
on business results.  
Theseconddriveristheoccasionalneedforcommittingtoahard  
date. We address this with the concept of high-integrity commitments,  
usedforthosesituationswhereweneedtocommittoadateoraspecific  
deliverable.  
There are several benefits to this way of working\:  
• First, the teams are much more motivated when they are free to  
solve the problem the best way they see fit. It’s the missionary  
versus mercenary thing again. Moreover, the teams are designed  
to be in the best position to solve these problems.  
• Second,theteamisnotoffthehookjustbydeliveringarequested  
feature or project. The feature must solve the business problem \(as  
measured by the key results\); otherwise, the team needs to try a  
different approach to the solution.  
• Third, no matter where the idea for the solution comes from, or  
how smart that person is, very often the initial approach doesn’t  
work out. Rather than pretending this is not the case, this model  
embraces that likelihood.  
It is all about outcomerather than output.  
Thereareafewproductteamsouttherethathavemodifiedtheir  
productroadmapssothateachitemisstatedasabusinessproblemtosolve **118** INSPIRED  
rather than the feature or project that may or may not solve it. These  
are called outcome-basedroadmaps.  
Ingeneral,whenIseethese,I’mprettyhappybecauseIknowthe  
product teams are stepping up to solve business problems rather than  
build features. Outcome-based roadmaps are essentially equivalent to  
using a business objective–based system such as the OKR system. It’s  
the format that’s different more than the content.  
There is a tendency, however, with outcome-based roadmaps to  
put a deadline date on every item, rather than only on the items with  
a true date constraint. This practice can have cultural and motivation  
implications to the team.  
# High-Integrity Commitments  
In most Agile teams, when you even mention the word “commit-  
ments” \(like knowing what you’re going to launch and when it will  
happen\), you get reactions ranging from squirming to denial.  
It’saconstantstrugglebetweenthoseexecutivesandstakehold-  
ers who are trying to run the business \(with hiring plans, market-  
ingprogramspend,partnerships,andcontractsdependingonspecific  
dates and deliverables\) and the product team that is understandably  
reluctanttocommittodatesanddeliverables.They’rereluctantwhen  
theydon’tyetunderstandwhattheyneedtodeliver,andifitwillwork  
in terms of delivering the necessary business results, in addition to  
notknowinghowmuchitwillreallycostbecausetheydon’tyetknow  
the solution.  
Underlying all of this is the hard-learned lessons of product  
teams that many of the ideas won’t work as we hope and those that  
could work will typically take several iterations to get to the point  
where they move the needle enough to be considered a business  
success.  
In a custom software environment, you might just be able to  
iterate until the business is satisfied with the software \(or they just  
give up on it\). In a product company, this won’t fly.  
Nowdon’tgetmewrong—you’vejustheardhowIfeelaboutthe  
perils of conventional roadmaps. Good product companies minimize

these commitments. But there  
are always some real commit-  
ments that need to be made  
in order to effectively run a  
company.  
So, what to do?  
The key is to understand  
that the root cause of all this  
grief about commitments is  
It’saconstantstruggle

deliverables.  
when these commitments are  
made. They are made too early. They are made before we know  
whether we can deliver on this obligation, and even more important,  
whether what we deliver will solve the problem for the customer.  
In the continuous discovery and delivery model, the discovery  
work is all about answering these questions before we spend the time  
and money to build production-quality products.  
So, the way we manage commitments is with a little bit of give  
and take.  
We ask the executives and our other stakeholders to give us a  
little time in product discovery to investigate the necessary solution.  
Weneedthetimetovalidatethatsolutionwithcustomerstoensureit  
hasthenecessaryvalueandusability,withengineerstoensureitsfeasi-  
bility,andwithourstakeholderstoensureitisviableforourbusiness.  
Once we have come up with a solution that works for our busi-  
ness, we now can make an informed and high-integrity commitment  
about when we can deliver and what business results we can expect.  
Note that our delivery managers are key to determining any  
commitment dates. Just because your engineers believe something  
might take only two weeks to build and deliver, what if that team is  
already occupied on other work, and they can’t start on this work for  
anothermonth?Thedeliverymanagerstrackthesecommitmentsand

So, the compromise is straightforward. The product team asks

# Product Vision  
# Overview  
In this section, I discuss the importance of a compelling and inspir-  
ing product vision, and how critical the role of product strategy is in  
delivering on the product vision. **CHAPTER**  
# 24  
# Product Vision  
# and Product Strategy  
# The Product Vision  
The product vision describes the future we are trying to create, typ-  
ically somewhere between two and five years out. For hardware or  
device-centric companies, it’s usually five to 10 years out.  
Notethatthisisnotthesameasthecompanymissionstatement.  
Examplesofmissionstatementsare“organizetheworld’sinformation”  
or“maketheworldmoreopenandconnected”or“enableanyoneany-  
where to buy anything anytime.” Mission statements are useful, but  
they don’t say anything about how we plan on accomplishing that.  
That’s what the product vision is for.  
Note also that the vision is not in any sense a spec. It’s mainly a  
persuasive piece that might be in the form of a storyboard, a narrative  
such as a white paper, or a special type of prototype referred to as  
a visiontype.  
**123** **124** INSPIRED  
Its primary purpose is to communicate this vision and inspire  
the teams \(and stakeholders, investors, partners—and, in many cases,  
prospective customers\) to want to help make this vision a reality.  
When done well, the product  
vision is one of our most effective  
recruiting tools, and it serves to  
motivate the people on your teams  
to come to work every day. Strong  
technology people are drawn to an

inspiringvision—theywanttowork  
on something meaningful.  
You can do some amount of testing of the vision, but it’s not the  
same as the testing of specific solutions we do in product discovery.  
Intruth,buyingintoavisionisalwaysabitofaleapoffaith.Youlikely  
don’t know how, or even if, you’ll be able to deliver on the vision. But  
rememberyouhaveseveralyearstodiscoverthesolutions.Atthisstage,  
you should believe it’s a worthwhile pursuit.  
# The Product Strategy  
One of the most basic of all product lessons learned is that trying to  
please everybody at once will almost certainly please nobody. So, the  
lastthingweshoulddoisembarkonaginormous,multi-yeareffortto  
create a release that tries to deliver on the product vision.  
Theproductstrategyisoursequenceofproductsorreleasesweplan  
to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision.  
I’musingthephrase“productsorreleases”hereloosely.Itmight  
bedifferentversionsofthesameproduct,aseriesofdifferentorrelated  
products, or some other set of meaningful milestones.  
For most types of businesses, I encourage teams to construct  
product strategy around a series of product/market fits. There are  
many variations on this \(the strategy for the product strategy, if you  
will\).  
For business-focused companies, you might have each product/  
market fit focus on a different vertical market \(e.g., financial services,  
manufacturing, automotive\). Product Vision and Product Strategy **125**  
For consumer-focused com-  
panies, we often structure each  
product/market fit around a dif-  
ferent customer or user persona.  
For example, an education-related  
service might have a strategy that  
targets high school students first,  
college students next, and then  
thosealreadyworkingbutwhowant  
to learn new skills.  
Sometimes, the product strat-  
egy is based on geography, where  
we tackle different regions of the  
world in an intentional sequence.  
And, sometimes, the product  
There’snosingleapproach

teamsthatthemost

strategy is based on achieving a set  
of key milestones in some sort of logical and important order. For  
example, “First deliver critical rating and reviews functionality to  
developers building e-commerce applications; next, leverage the data  
generated from this use to create a database of consumer product  
sentiment; and then leverage these data for advanced product  
recommendations.”  
There’s no single approach to product strategy that is ideal  
for everyone, and you can never know how things might have gone  
if you sequenced your product work differently. I tell teams that  
the most important benefit is just that you decided to focus your  
product work on a single target market at a time. So, all teams know  
we’re tackling the manufacturing market now, and that’s the type  
of customers we are obsessing on. Our goal is to come up with the  
smallest actual deliverable product that makes these manufacturing  
customers successful. Ideas that come up that pertain to other types  
of customers or markets are saved for future consideration.  
Besides significantly increasing your chance of delivering some-  
thing that can power your business, the product strategy now gives  
you a tool to align your product work with your sales and marketing  
organizations.  
We want the sales organization to sell in the markets where  
we’ve demonstrated product/market fit. As soon as we demonstrate **126** INSPIRED  
product/market fit for a new mar-  
ket \(usually by developing an initial  
setofreferencecustomers\),wewant  
the sales force to go out and find as  
many additional customers in that  
market as possible.  
Let’s get back to the concept  
of providing context to the product  
teams.  
Thedifferencebetween  
visionandstrategyis

Leadershipinspires and

empoweredandactwithanymean-

vision, and the path to achieving that vision is the productstrategy.  
Themoreproductteamsyouhave,themoreessentialitistohave  
thisunifyingvisionandstrategyforeachteamtobeabletomakegood

And, just to be clear—the idea is not that every product team has  
its own product vision. That would miss the point. The idea is that  
our organizationhas a product vision, and all the product teams in that  
organization are helping to contribute to making that vision a reality.  
Of course, in very large organizations, while the mission state-

# Principles of Product Vision  
**T**hese are the 10 key principles for coming up with an effective  
product vision.  
1\. Start with why. This is coincidentally the name of a great book  
on the value of product vision by Simon Sinek. The central  
notion here is to use the product vision to articulate your  
purpose. Everything follows from that.  
2\. Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution. I hope  
you’ve heard this before, as it’s been said many times, in many  
ways, by many people. But it’s very true and something a great  
many product people struggle with.  
3\. Don’tbeafraidtothinkbigwithvision.ToooftenIseeprod-  
uct visions that are not nearly ambitious enough, the kind of  
thing we can pull off in six months to a year or so, and not sub-  
stantial enough to inspire anyone.  
**129** **130** INSPIRED  
4\. Don’t be afraid to disrupt  
yourselves because, if you  
don’t, someone else will. So  
Fallinlovewiththe  
problem,notwiththe  
solution.  
many companies focus their  
efforts on protecting what  
they have rather than constantly creating new value for their  
customers.  
5\. The product vision needs to inspire. Remember that we  
need product teams of missionaries, not mercenaries. More  
than anything else, it is the product vision that will inspire  
missionary-like passion in the organization. Create something  
you can get excited about. You can make any product vision  
meaningful if you focus on how you genuinely help your users  
and customers.  
6\. Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends.  
Too many companies ignore important trends for far too long.  
It is not very hard to identify the important trends. What’s hard  
is to help the organization understand how those trends can be  
leveraged by your products to solve customer problems in new  
and better ways.  
7\. Skate to where the puck is heading, not to where it was.  
An important element to product vision is identifying the  
things that are changing—as well as the things that likely won’t  
be changing—in the time frame of the product vision. Some  
product visions are wildly optimistic and unrealistic about how  
fastthingswillchange,andothersarefartooconservative.This  
is usually the most difficult aspect of a good product vision.  
8\. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details. This Jeff  
Bezos line is very important. So many teams give up on their  
product vision far too soon. This is usually called a visionpivot,  
but mostly it’s a sign of a weak product organization. It is never  
easy, so prepare yourself for that. But, also be careful you don’t  
get attached to details. It is very possible that you may have to  
adjust course to reach your desired destination. That’s called a  
discoverypivot, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Principles of Product Vision **131**

make sure what you’re working on is meaningful, and recruit  
people to the product teams who also feel passionate about this  
problem and then be willing to work for several years to realize  
the vision.  
10\. Evangelize continuously and relentlessly. There is no such  
thing as over-communicating when it comes to explaining and

# Principles of Product  
# Strategy  
**A**swediscussedpreviously,thereareanynumberofapproachesto  
product strategy, but good strategies have these five principles in  
common\:  
1\. Focus on one target market or persona at a time. Don’t try  
to please everyone in a single release. Focus on one new target  
market, or one new target persona, for each release. You’ll find  
that the product will still likely be useful to others, but at least it  
will be loved by some, and that’s key.  
2\. Product strategy needs to be aligned with business strategy.  
The vision is meant to inspire the organization, but the organi-  
zation ultimately is there to come up with solutions that deliver  
on the business strategy. So, for example, if that business strat-

then the product strategy needs to be aligned with this.

to-market strategy. Similarly,  
if we have a new sales and  
marketing channel, we need to ensure that our product strat-  
egy is aligned with that new channel. A new sales channel or  
go-to-marketstrategycanhavefar-reachingimpactonaproduct.  
4\. Obsess over customers, not over competitors. Toomanycom-  
panies completely forget about their product strategy once they  
encounter a serious competitor. They panic and then find them-  
selves chasing their competitor’s actions and no longer focusing  
on their customers. We can’t ignore the market, but remember  
that customers rarely leave us for our competitors. They leave us  
because we stop taking care of them.  
5\. Communicate the strategy across the organization. This is

# Product Principles  
**I**always like to complement the product vision and product strategy  
with a set of product principles.  
Wheretheproductvisiondescribesthefutureyouwanttocreate,  
and the product strategy describes your path to achieving that vision,  
the product principles speak to the nature of the products you want to  
create.

toanyoneproductrelease.Theprinciplesarealignedwiththeproduct

As an example, early on at eBay we found we needed a product  
principle that spoke to the relationship between buyers and sellers.  
Most of the revenue came from sellers, so we had a strong incentive  
to find ways to please sellers, but we soon realized that the real reason  
sellers loved us was because we provided them with buyers. This real-  
ization led to a critical principle that stated, “In cases where the needs

# Product Objectives  
# Overview  
I was extremely fortunate to have started my career at HP as an  
engineer during their heyday, when they were known as the industry’s  
most successful and enduring example of consistent innovation and  
execution.  
As part of HP’s internal engineering management training pro-  
gramcalledTheHPWay,Iwasintroducedtoabusinessobjective–based  
system known as MBO—managementbyobjectives.  
Dave Packard claimed\: “No \[tool\] has contributed more to  
Hewlett-Packard’s success. \[MBO\] is the antithesis of management by  
control.”  
TheMBOsystemwasrefinedandimprovedatseveralcompanies  
over the years, most notably by the legendary Andy Grove at Intel.  
Today, the primary business objective management system we use is  
known as the OKR system—objectivesandkeyresults.  
John Doerr brought the technique from Intel to a very young  
Google, and a couple decades after Dave Packard attributed much of  
HP’ssuccesstoMBO,LarryPagesaidessentiallythesamethingabout  
the importance of the OKR process on Google’s success.  
The concept is straightforward and based on two fundamental  
principles\:  
1\. The first can easily be summed up with the famous General  
George Patton quote I mentioned earlier\: “Never tell people  
how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise  
you with their ingenuity.” **138** INSPIRED  
2\. The second was captured by HP’s tagline of that era\: “When  
performance is measured by results.” The idea here is that you  
can release all the features you want, but if it doesn’t solve the  
underlying business problem, you haven’t really solved anything.  
The first principle is fundamentally about how to empower and  
motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is  
about how to meaningfully measure progress.  
Somuchhaschangedinourindustryovertheyears,butthesetwo  
fundamental management principles are still at the foundation of how  
the best tech companies and teams operate.  
While there are several work-  
ablesystemsandtoolsformanaging  
these business objectives, in this  
book, I’ll focus on the OKR system  
technique. Most of the major suc-  
cessful tech companies have been  
using it for several years now. It  
seems to have hit some sort of tip-  
ping point and is now spreading  
globally.  
While the concept of team  
objectives might sound straightfor-  
ward, there are many ways to institutionalize this across product  
teams and organizations, and it can take a few quarters before the  
organization finds its groove.

1\. Objectives should be qualitative; key results need to be quanti-  
tative/measurable.  
2\. Keyresultsshouldbeameasureofbusiness results,notoutputor  
tasks.  
3\. Therest ofthe companywill useOKRs abit differently,but for  
the product management, design, and technology organization,  
focus on the organization’s objectives and the objectives for each  
product team,whicharedesignedtorollupandachievetheorga-  
nization’s objectives. Don’t let personal objectives or functional  
team objectives dilute or confuse the focus.  
**139** Key results should be a  
measure of business  
results, not output or tasks.  
**140** INSPIRED  
4\. Find a good cadence for  
your organization \(typically,  
annuallyforanorganization’s  
objectives and quarterly for a  
team’s objectives\).  
5\. Keep the number of objectives and key results for the organiza-  
tion and for each team small \(one to three objectives, with one  
to three key results each is typical\).  
6\. It’s critical that every product team track their active progress  
against their objectives \(which is typically weekly\).  
7\. The objectives do not need to cover every little thing the team  
does, but they should cover what the team needs to accomplish.  
8\. It’s important that, one way or another, teams feel accountable  
to achieving their objectives. If they fail substantially, it’s worth  
having a post-mortem/retrospective with some of their peers or  
management.  
9\. Agree as an organization on how you will be evaluating or  
scoring your key results. There are different approaches to this,  
and it’s in large part a reflection of your particular company  
culture. What’s important here is consistency across the orga-  
nization, so that teams know when they can depend on one  
another. It’s common to define a score of 0 \(on a scale from  
0 to 1.0\) if you essentially make no progress, 0.3 if you just did  
the bare minimum—what you know you can achieve, 0.7 if  
you’ve accomplished more than the minimum and have really  
done what you’d hoped you would achieve, and 1.0 if you’ve  
really surprised yourselves and others with a truly exceptional  
result, beyond what people were even hoping for.  
10\. Establish very clear and consistent ways to indicate when a  
key result is in reality a high-integrity commitment \(described  
earlier\)ratherthananormalobjective.Inotherwords,formost  
key results, you may be shooting for that 0.7 score. But for  
a high-integrity commitment, these are special, and it’s more  
binary. You either delivered what you promised or you didn’t. The OKR Technique **141**  
11\. Be very transparent \(across the product and technology organi-  
zation\) on what objectives each product team is working on and  
their current progress.  
12\. Senior management \(CEO and executive team\) is responsible  
for the organization’s objectives and key results. The heads of  
product and technology are responsible for the product team  
objectives \(and ensuring they deliver on the organization’s  
objectives\). The individual product teams are responsible  
for proposing the key results for each objective they’ve been  
assigned. It is normal to have a give-and-take process each  
quarter as the OKRs are finalized for each team and for the  
organization. **CHAPTER**

# Product Team Objectives  
**T**he OKR technique has enjoyed considerable success, especially  
insidetechnologyproductorganizations,fromlargetosmall.And  
there have been some very important lessons learned as teams and  
organizations work to improve their ability to execute.  
OKRs are a very general tool that can be used by anyone in the  
organization, in any role, or even for your use in your personal life.  
However,aswithanytool,somewaysofapplyingthemarebetterthan  
others.  
Throughout this book, I emphasize the importance of a product  
team. Recall that a product team is a cross-functional set of profession-  
als, typically comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and  
a small number of engineers. In addition, there are sometimes addi-  
tional people with specialized skills included on the team, such as a  
data analyst, a user researcher, or a test automation engineer.  
Also recall that each product team typically is responsible for  
somesignificantpartofthecompany’sproductofferingortechnology.  
For example, one product team might be responsible for mobile apps  
**143** **144** INSPIRED  
for drivers, another for mobile apps for riders, another might be  
responsible for secure payment handling, and so on.  
The key is that these people with their different skill sets usually  
come from different functional departments in the company, but they  
sit and work all day—every day—with their cross-functional team to  
solve hard business and technology problems.  
It’snotunusualinlargerorganizationstohaveontheorderof20

For companies using the OKR system, the problems these teams  
areaskedtotackleare,asyoumightexpect,communicatedandtracked  
throughtheproductteam’sOKRs.TheOKRsalsohelptoensurethat  
each team is aligned with the objectives of the company.  
Moreover, as an organization scales, OKRs become an increas-  
ingly necessary tool for ensuring that each product team understands  
how they are contributing to the greater whole, coordinating work  
across teams, and avoiding duplicate work.  
Thereasonthisissoimportanttounderstandisthatwhenorgani-  
zationsfirststartwithOKRs,there’sacommontendencytohaveeach  
functional department create their own OKRs for their own organiza-  
tion.Forexample,thedesigndepartmentmighthaveobjectivesrelated  
to moving to a responsive design; the engineering department might  
have objectives related to improving the scalability and performance  
of the architecture; and the quality department might have objectives  
relating to the test and release automation.  
The problem is that the individual members of each of these  
functional departments are the actual members of a cross-functional  
product team. The product team has business-related objectives \(for  
example, to reduce the customer acquisition cost, to increase the  
number of daily active users, or to reduce the time to onboard a new  
customer\), but each person on the team may have their own set of  
objectives that cascade down through their functional manager.  
Imagine if the engineers were told to spend their time on  
re-platforming, the designers on moving to a responsive design, and  
QA on retooling. While each of these may be worthy activities, the  
chances of solving the business problems that the cross-functional  
teams were created to solve are not high. Product Team Objectives **145**  
What all too often happens  
in this case is that the people on  
the product teams are conflicted as  
to where they should be spending  
their time. This results in confu-

sion, frustration, and disappointing  
results from leadership and individual contributors alike.  
But this is easily avoided.  
If you deploy OKRs for your product organization, the key is to  
focus your OKRs at the product team level.  
This means don’t let functional team or individual person OKRs  
confuse the issue.  
Focus the attention of the individuals on their product team  
objectives. If different functional organizations \(such as design,  
engineering, or quality assurance\) have larger objectives \(such as  
responsive design, technical debt, and test automation\), they should  
be discussed and prioritized at the leadership team level along with  
the other business objectives, and then incorporated into the relevant  
product team’s objectives.  
Notethatit’snotaproblemformanagersofthefunctionalareasto  
haveindividualobjectivesrelatingtotheirorganization.Thisisbecause  
these people aren’t conflicted, as they’re not normally serving on a  
product team.  
For example, the head of UX design might be responsible for a  
strategy for migrating to a responsive design; the head of engineering  
might be responsible for delivering a strategy around managing tech-  
nical debt; the head of product management might be responsible for  
deliveringaproductvision;ortheheadofQAmightberesponsiblefor

It’s also not normally a big problem if individual contributors  
\(such as a particular engineer, designer, or product manager\) has a  
small number of personal growth-related objectives \(such as improv-  
ing their knowledge of a particular technology\). This assumes the  
individual isn’t committing to a burden that will interfere with their  
ability to contribute their part to their product team, which of course  
is their primary responsibility.

# Product Objectives @ Scale  
**T**he OKR system is very scalable. I would argue some sort of tool  
for managing and aligning work is critical to scaling effectively,  
but it’s also true that many companies do struggle with scaling their  
use of OKRs.  
In this chapter, I shine a light on what needs to change as you  
use the OKR system at scale. Remember that I’m just talking about  
the product and technology organization here \(product management,  
user experience design, and engineering\), and while you can use the  
techniques I’m about to describe at any scale, I am focused here on  
growth stage or enterprise organizations.  
1\. With startups or small organizations, when everyone essentially  
knows what everyone else is doing and why, it’s normal for each  
product team to propose their objectives and key results. There’s  
someamountofgiveandtake,andthenpeoplegettowork.With  
larger organizations, product teams need more help.  
**147** **148** INSPIRED  
The first help they need is a very clear understanding of  
theorganization-levelobjectives.Let’ssaythatthetoptwoobjec-  
tivesforthecompanyaretoimprovecustomerlifetimevalueand  
expandglobally.Let’salsosayyouhaveontheorderof25product  
teams.Alltheproductteamslikelyhavethoughtsonbothofthese  
organizational objectives, but, clearly, the company will need to  
be smart about which teams pursue each objective. Some teams  
might focus on only one, others might contribute to both, and  
yet other teams may be tackling critical work beyond those two  
objectives.  
Leadership \(especially the head of product, head of  
technology, and head of design\) will need to discussthe company  
objectives and which teams are best suited to pursue each  
objective.  
2\. Moreover, at scale, it is very common to have some significant  
number of product teams that are there in support of the other  
product teams. These are often called platform product teams, or  
sharedservicesproductteams.Theyareveryhighleverage,butthey  
are a little different in that they generally don’t directly serve  
customers. They serve customers indirectly, usually through the  
higher-level, solution-focused product teams. These platform  
teams will get requests from most or even all the higher-level  
product teams, and they are there to help them succeed. But,  
again, leadership will need to help coordinate the objectives for  
these teams and make sure we coordinate the dependencies and  
align the interests.  
3\. Once you have your objectives, there is a very critical reconcilia-  
tion process in which the leadership team looks at the proposed  
key results from the product teams and identifies gaps and then  
lookstowhatmightbeadjustedtocoverthosegaps\(forexample,  
enlisting the help of additional teams or reviewing the priority of  
the work\).  
4\. At scale, it’s much harder to know what product teams are work-  
ing on which objectives and the progress they are making. There  
arenowavarietyofonlinetoolsthathelporganizationsmakethe  
objectives transparent to the organization. But even with these  
tools, we lean on management to help connect the dots between  
teams. Product Objectives @ Scale **149**  
5\. The larger the organization,  
the longer the list of high-  
integrity commitments that  
are needed, and the more  
actively they need to be man-  
aged and tracked. Delivery  
managers play a key role  
in tracking and managing  
these dependencies and our  
commitments.

# Product Evangelism  
**P**roductevangelismis,asGuyKawasakiputityearsago,“sellingthe  
dream.” It’s helping people imagine the future and inspiring them  
to help create that future.  
If you’re a startup founder, a CEO, or a head of product, this is  
a very big part of your job, and you’ll have a hard time assembling a  
strong team if you don’t get good at it.  
Ifyou’reaproductmanager—especiallyatalargecompany—and  
you’re not good at evangelism, there’s a very strong chance that your  
product efforts will get derailed before they see the light of day.  
And even if product does manage to ship, it will likely go the way of  
thousands of other large company efforts and wither on the vine.  
We’vetalkedabouthowimportantitistohaveateamofmission-  
aries, not mercenaries, and evangelism is a key responsibility to make  
this happen. The responsibility for this falls primarily on the product  
manager.  
There are several techniques to help communicate the value  
of what you’re proposing to your team, colleagues, stakeholders,  
**151** **152** INSPIRED  
executives, and investors. Here are my top-10 pieces of advice for  
product managers to sell the dream\:  
1\. Use a prototype. For many people, it’s way too hard to see the  
forest through the trees. When all you have is a bunch of user  
stories, it can be difficult to see the big picture and how things  
hang together \(or even if they hang together\). A prototype lets  
them clearly see the forest and the trees.  
2\. Share the pain. Show the team the customer pain you are  
addressing. This is why I love to bring engineers along for  
customervisitsandmeetings.Formanypeople,theyhavetosee  
\(or experience\) the pain themselves to get it.  
3\. Share the vision. Makesureyouhaveaveryclearunderstanding  
ofyourproductvision,productstrategy,andproductprinciples.  
Showhowyourworkcontributestothisvisionandistruetothe  
principles.  
4\. Share learnings generously. After every user test or customer  
visit, share your learnings—not just the things that went well,  
but share the problems, too. Give your team the information  
they need to help come up with the solution.  
5\. Share credit generously. Make sure the team views it as their  
product, not just your product. However, when things don’t go  
well, step forward and take responsibility for the miss and show  
the team you’re learning from the mistakes as well. They’ll  
respect you for it.  
6\. Learn how to give a great demo. This is an especially impor-  
tant skill to use with customers and key execs. We’re not trying  
to teach them how to operate the product, and we’re not trying  
to do a user test on them. We’re trying to show them the value  
ofwhatwe’rebuilding.Ademoisnottraining,andit’snotatest.  
It’s a persuasive tool. Get really, really good at it.  
7\. Do your homework. Your team and your stakeholders will all  
bemuchmorelikelytofollowyouiftheybelieveyouknowwhat  
you’re talking about. Be the undisputed expert on your users  
and customers. And be the undisputed expert on your market,  
including your competitors and the relevant trends. excited. Enthusiasm really  
is contagious.

people see you’re genuinely

blyfixthat—eitherbychang-  
ing what you work on or by

9\. Learn to show some enthusiasm. Assuming you’re genuinely  
excited, it’s amazing to me how many product managers are  
so bad or so uncomfortable at showing enthusiasm. This  
matters—a lot. Absolutely be sincere, but let people see you’re  
genuinely excited. Enthusiasm really is contagious.  
10\. Spend time with your team. Ifyou’renotspendingsignificant  
face time with your designer and every engineer on your team,  
then they can’t see the enthusiasm in your eyes. If your team  
is not co-located, you’ll need to make a special effort to travel  
there and do this at least every couple months. Spending some  
personal time with every last person on the team pays off big in  
their level of motivation and, as a result, in the velocity of the  
team. It’s worth your time.

Backin2003—afullfouryearsbeforethedebutoftheiPhone—a  
young product manager at the BBC, Alex Pressland, had just finished  
leading a product effort that enabled the BBC to be one of the first  
media companies in the world to syndicate content. Most people at  
the BBC had no idea why this was important or even desirable, but  
Alex understood that this enabling technology could be used in new

Because Alex understood the potential for IP-based syndicated  
content technology, she started searching for new and useful ways  
to put this technology to use. She began by looking at people in

Eventhoughthispartistitled“TheRightProcess,”Ihopeyou’ll  
soon realize that the right process is not any singleprocess. Rather, it’s  
more accurately described as a combination of techniques, mindset,  
and culture.  
I mostly emphasize discovery techniques, as our focus is on  
product managers, and that is their primary responsibility.  
The bulk of the product manager’s time needs to be focused on  
working with her product team, with her key stakeholders, and with  
her customers to discover solutions that her customers love and that  
work for the business.  
**159** **160** INSPIRED  
Keep in mind, however, that the product manager and product  
designer do need to ensure that they’re available to answer questions  
from the engineers that arise during delivery activities. Normally,  
answering these delivery questions is on the order of half an hour to  
an hour of time per day. Product Discovery **161**  
# Product Discovery  
# Overview  
Most of us are working on solving some pretty hard problems, and  
it usually ends up taking some fairly complex systems to power these  
solutions. For most teams, there are two very significant challenges to  
tackle.  
First, discovering in detail what the customer solution needs to  
be. That includes everything from making sure there are enough cus-  
tomers that even need this solution \(the demand\) and then coming up  
with a solution that works for our customers and for our business.  
Evenharder,weneedtomakesurewecomeupwithasinglesolu-  
tionthat works for many customers, and not a series of specials. To do  
this, we need to be able to test out many ideas, and we need to do this  
quickly and inexpensively.

mentation that our customers can depend on for consistently reliable  
value.Yourteamneedstobeabletoreleasewithconfidence.Whileyou’ll  
never have 100 percent confidence, you should not have to release  
and pray.  
So, we need to learn fast, yet also release with confidence.  
It’s understandable that many people might naturally view these  
two difficult goals as at odds with each other. We are in a big hurry  
to push something out to learn what works and what doesn’t. Yet, we  
don’twanttoreleasesomethingthat’snotreadyforprimetimeandrisk

we possibly consider launching this?  
Inthissection,Iclarifyhowstrongteamsworktomeetthesedual  
andsimultaneousobjectivesofrapidlearningindiscovery,yetbuilding  
stable and solid releases in delivery.  
In general, I find that most product teams have a much better  
sense of how to accomplish the second goal of delivering solid soft-  
ware than how to accomplish the first goal of rapid experimentation  
and discovery. Continuous delivery is a good example of an advanced  
deliverytechnique I find in teams that understand the importance of a  
series of small, incremental changes to a complex system.  
Partofwhatcausesconfusionisadilutionofwhatisreallymeant  
when we call something a “product” or “product-quality” or “produc-  
tized” or “live in production.”  
I always try hard to reserve the term productto describe the state  
at which we can run a business on it. Specifically, it is scalable and  
performant to the degree necessary. It has a strong suite of automated  
regression tests. It is instrumented to collect the necessary analytics.  
It has been internationalized and localized where appropriate. It is  
maintainable. It is consistent with the brand promise. And, most  
important, it is something the team can release with confidence.  
This is not easy—it’s where most of the time goes when our  
engineers are building. As such, we try very hard not to waste this  
effort.  
Doing all this work when the product manager isn’t even sure  
this is the solution the customer wants or needs is a recipe for product  
failure and big waste. So, the purpose of product discovery is to make Product Discovery **163**  
sure we have some evidence that when we ask the engineers to build  
a production-quality product, it won’t be a wasted effort. And, this is  
why we have so many different techniques in product discovery.  
We’ve got techniques for getting a much deeper understanding  
ofourusersandcustomers,andforvalidatingproductideasbothqual-  
itatively and quantitatively. And, in fact, most of the techniques don’t  
requirethedeveloper’stime\(whichisimportant,becauseweappreciate  
howmuchtimeandeffortneedstogointocreatingproduction-quality  
software in delivery\).  
Much of the key to effective product discovery is getting access  
to our customers without trying to push our quick experiments into  
production.  
If you are an early stage startup and you have no customers, then  
of course this is not really an issue \(and it’s very likely premature to  
even be creating production-quality software\).  
But, for most of us, we have real customers and real revenue, so  
wedohavetocareaboutthis.Laterinthissection,we’lltalkaboutthe

But here’s the key. If you want to discovergreat products, it really  
is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers  
early and often.  
Ifyouwanttodelivergreatproducts,youwanttousebestpractices  
for engineering and try not to override the engineers’ concerns. **CHAPTER**  
# 33  
# Principles of Product  
# Discovery  
**T**he purpose of product discovery is to address these critical risks\:  
• Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it? \(Value risk\)  
• Can the user figure out how to use it? \(Usability risk\)  
• Can we build it? \(Feasibility risk\)  
• Does this solution work for our business? \(Business viability risk\)  
Andit’snotenoughthatit’sjusttheproductmanager’sopinionon  
these questions. We need to collect evidence.  
When it comes to how we do product discovery,there are a set of  
core principles that drive how we work. If you understand these, you  
willunderstandnotonlyhowtoworkwelltodaybutalsohowtoeasily  
incorporate new techniques as they emerge in the future.  
**165** **166** INSPIRED  
1\. We know we can’t count on  
our customers \(or our exec-  
utives or stakeholders\) to tell  
us what to build.  
Customers don’t know  
what’s possible, and with

us know what we really want  
until we actually see it. It’s not that customers or our executives  
are necessarily wrong; it’s just that it’s our job to make sure the  
solutionwedeliversolvestheunderlyingproblem.Thisisprob-  
ably the most fundamental principle in all of modern product.  
Historically, in the vast majority of innovations in our industry,  
the customers had no idea that what they now love was even a  
possibility. This is only becoming truer with time.  
2\. The most important thing is to establish compelling value.  
It’s all hard, but the hardest part of all is creating the nec-  
essary value so that customers ultimately choose to buy or to use.  
We can survive for a while with usability issues or performance  
issues, but without the core value, we really have nothing. As a  
result, this is generally where we’ll need to spend most of our  
discovery time.  
3\. As hard and important as the engineering is, coming up with a  
gooduserexperienceisusuallyevenharder,andmorecriticalto  
success.  
While every product team has engineers, not every team  
has the necessary product design skills, and even when they do,  
are they being used the way we need to use them?  
4\. Functionality, design, and technology are inherently inter-  
twined.  
In the old waterfall model, the market drove the function-  
ality\(akatherequirements\),whichdrovethedesign,whichdrove  
the implementation.  
Today, we know that the technology drives \(and enables\)  
thefunctionalityasmuchastheotherwayaround.Weknowthat  
technology drives \(and enables\) design. We know that design Principles of Product Discovery **167**  
drives\(andenables\)functionality.Youdon’thavetolookfurther  
than your own phone to see numerous examples of both. The  
point is that all three of these are completely intertwined. This

eral iterations.  
To quote Marc Andreessen, “The most important thing is  
to know what you can’t know,” and we can’t know in advance  
which of our ideas will work with customers and which won’t.  
So, we approach discovery with the mindset that many, if not  
most,ofourideaswon’tworkout.Themostcommonreasonfor  
this is value, but sometimes the design is too complicated, and  
sometimes it would take far too long to build, and sometimes

6\. We must validate our ideas on real users and customers.

We might be basing that on actual customer research or on our

do this before we spend the time and expense to build an actual  
product, and not after.  
7\. Ourgoalindiscoveryistovalidateourideasthefastest,cheapest  
way possible.  
Discovery is about the need for speed. This lets us try  
out many ideas, and for the promising ideas, try out multiple  
approaches. There are many different types of ideas, many  
different types of products, and a variety of different risks that  
we need to address \(value risk, usability risk, feasibility risk, and  
business risk\). So, we have a wide range of techniques, each  
suitable to different situations. **168** INSPIRED  
8\. Weneedtovalidatethefeasibilityofourideasduringdiscovery,  
not after.  
If the first time your developers see an idea is at sprint  
planning, you have failed. We need to ensure the feasibility  
before we decide to build, not after. Not only does this end up  
saving a lot of wasted time, but it turns out that getting the  
engineer’s perspective earlier also tends to improve the solution  
itself, and it’s critical for shared learning.  
9\. We need to validate the business viability of our ideas during  
discovery, not after.  
Similarly,itisabsolutelycriticaltoensurethatthesolution  
we build will meet the needs of our business—before we take  
the time and expense to build out that product. Business  
viability includes financial considerations, marketing \(both  
brand and go-to-market considerations\), sales, legal, business  
development, and senior executives. Few things destroy morale  
or confidence in the product manager more than finding out  
after a product has been built that the product manager did not  
understand some essential aspect of the business.  
10\. It’s about shared learning.  
One of the keys to having a team of missionaries rather  
thanateamofmercenariesisthattheteamhaslearnedtogether.  
Theyhaveseenthecustomer’spaintogether,theyhavewatched  
together as some ideas failed and others worked, and they all  
understandthecontextforwhythisisimportantandwhatneeds  
to be done.  
Everything that follows is based on these core principles.  
# Ethics\: Should We Build It?  
In general, product discovery is about tackling risks around value,  
usability, feasibility, and business viability. However, in some cases,  
there’s an additional risk\: ethics.  
I know this is a sensitive topic, and I don’t want to sound  
like I’m preaching or condescending in the least, but I personally

tion, “Should we build it?”  
You may think this is a  
matterofdoingsomethingille-  
implications of their  
solutions, too.  
gal, but in the vast majority of  
cases where ethics is an issue, it’s not usually a matter of law. Rather,  
just because we have the technology to build something, and even if  
it otherwise works to accomplish the specific business objective, this  
does not necessarily mean that we should build it.  
More commonly, the issue is that our technology and design  
skills are such that we might come up with a solution that meets our  
business objectives \(for example, around engagement, growth, or  
monetization\) but can end up with a side effect of causing harm to  
users or the environment.  
So, I encourage product teams to consider the ethical impli-  
cations of their solutions, too. When a significant ethical risk is  
identified, see if you can’t find alternative solutions that solve the  
problem in a way that doesn’t have negative consequences.  
I have one final, but critically important, note about raising  
ethics issues with senior management. You absolutely need to have  
a strong understanding of your business, especially how you make  
money. You need to use good judgment and be sensitive in your  
discussion. You are not there to try to police the organization but,  
rather, to identify issues and bring potential solutions.  
# Discovery Iterations  
Mostproductteamsnormallythinkofaniteration asadeliveryactivity.  
If you release weekly, you think in terms of one-week iterations.  
\(continued\) **170** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
But we also have the concept of an iteration in discovery. We  
loosely define an iteration in discovery as trying out at least one new  
idea or approach. It’s true that ideas come in all shapes and sizes, and  
some are much riskier than others, but the purpose of discovery is to  
do this much faster and cheaper than we can do in delivery.

# Discovery Techniques  
# Overview  
**T**here is no one perfect taxonomy for discovery techniques because  
several of the techniques are helpful for multiple different situa-  
tions. Regardless, following are the key techniques in the framework  
that I personally use and find helpful.  
# Discovery Framing Techniques  
Framing techniques help us to quickly identify the underlying issues  
thatmustbetackledduringproductdiscovery.Ifwe’rehandedapoten-  
tial solution, we need to clarify the underlying problem to be solved.  
We need to tease out the risks and determine where it makes sense to  
focus our time. We also need to ensure that we understand how our  
work fits in with the work of other teams.  
**171** **172** INSPIRED  
# Discovery Planning Techniques  
There are a few techniques that are useful throughout the product  
discovery effort and help with identifying the bigger challenges and  
planning how you’ll attack this work. We’ll discuss these here.  
# Discovery Ideation Techniques  
There are, of course, any number of ways to come up with ideas. But  
some sources are better than others in their potential for keeping us  
focused on the most important problems. Ideation techniques are  
designed to provide the product team with a wealth of promising  
solutions aimed at the problems we’re focused on now.  
# Discovery Prototyping Techniques  
Our go-to tool for product discovery is typically a prototype. We’ll

# Discovery Testing Techniques  
Product discovery is mostly about quickly trying out an idea. We are  
essentiallytryingtoseparatethegoodideasfromthebad.Hereweare  
defining a good idea as one that solves the underlying problem in a  
way that customers will buy, they can figure out how to use, we have  
thetimeandskillsandtechnologyontheteamtobuild,andthatworks  
for the various aspects of our business.  
It’s important to recognize that many ideas don’t have that much  
risk associated with them. They may be very straightforward. Or they  
might just have one area that’s a risk, such as our legal department’s  
concern about a potential privacy issue.

# Testing Feasibility

wheretheyidentifyconcerns.Thesolutionbeingtestedmightrequire

may be significant scale or performance challenges. Or there might  
be third-party components that need to be evaluated.  
# Testing Usability  
These techniques are designed for the product designers to address  
areas where they have identified concerns. Many of our products have  
complex workflows and the designers need to ensure their interaction  
designs make sense to the user and potential sources of confusion are  
identified and pre-empted.  
# Testing Value  
Much of our time in product discovery is spent validating value or  
working to increase the perceived value. If it’s a new product, we need  
toensurethatcustomerswillbuyit,atthepriceweneedtocharge,and  
that they’ll switch from whatever they’re using today. If it’s an existing  
product,andweareimprovingthatproduct\(suchaswithanewfeature

we need to ensure the customers will choose to use the new feature or  
new design.  
# Testing Business Viability  
Sadly,it’snotenoughtocreateaproductorsolutionthatourcustomers  
love, that is usable, and that our engineers can deliver. The product **174** INSPIRED  
also must work for our business. This is what it means to be viable.  
This means that we can afford the cost of building and provisioning  
the product and the costs to market and sell the product. It needs to  
be something our sales force is capable of selling. It means that the  
solution needs to also work for our business development partners. It  
needs to work for our legal colleagues. It needs to be consistent with  
our company’s brand promise. These techniques are about validating  
these types of risks.  
# Transformation Techniques  
When working to migrate your organization from working the way

There are, as you might imagine, many other useful techniques based  
on specific types of products or situations, and new techniques are  
always emerging. But, these are your go-to techniques. Discovery Framing Techniques **175**  
# Discovery Framing  
# Techniques  
# Overview  
Much of our product discovery work doesn’t require a lot of framing  
or planning. We need to come up with a solution to a particular prob-  
lem, and often this is straightforward, and we can proceed directly to  
delivery work.  
But for many efforts, this is decidedly not the case, and some  
framing and true problem solving becomes critically important.  
Big projects—and, especially, initiatives \(projects spanning multiple  
teams\)—are common examples.  
In this section, I consider how we frame our discovery work to  
ensure alignment and to identify key risks.  
There are really two goals here\:  
1\. The first is to ensure the team is all on the same page in terms of  
clarity of purpose and alignment. In particular, we need to agree  
on the business objective we’re focused on, the specific problem  
we are intending to solve for our customers, which user or cus-  
tomers you’re solving that problem for, and how you will know  
if you’ve succeeded. These should align directly to your product  
team’s objectives and key results.  
2\. Thesecondpurposeistoidentifythebigrisksthatwillneedtobe  
tackled during the discovery work. I find that most teams tend  
to gravitate toward a particular type of risk that they are most  
comfortable with. Ensure the team is all on

risks. They know this change  
involves a complex workflow, and they’re nervous about that, so they  
want to dive in right there.  
Those are both legitimate risks, but in my experience, they are  
generally the easier risks to tackle.  
Wemustalsoconsidervalue risk—dothecustomerswantthispar-  
ticularproblemsolvedandisourproposedsolutiongoodenoughtoget  
people to switch from what they have now?  
And then there’s the often-messy business risk, where we have to  
make sure that the solution we come up with in discovery works for  
the different parts of our company. Here are some common examples  
of that\:  
• Financial risk—can we afford this solution?  
• Business development risk—does this solution work for our  
partners?  
• Marketing risk—is this solution consistent with our brand?  
• Sales risk—is this solution something our sales staff is equipped  
to sell?  
• Legal risk—is this something we can do from a legal or  
compliance perspective?  
• Ethical risk—is this solution something we should do?  
Formanythings,wewon’thaveconcernsalongthesedimensions,  
but, when we do, it’s something that we must tackle aggressively.  
Iftheproductmanager,designer,andtechleaddonotfeelthere’s  
a significant risk in any of these areas, then normally we would just  
proceed to delivery—fully realizing there’s a chance the team will  
occasionally be proved wrong. This, however, is preferable to the Discovery Framing Techniques **177**  
alternativeofhavingtheteambeextremelyconservativeandtestevery  
assumption.  
We like to use our discovery time and validation techniques for  
those situations in which we know there’s a significant risk, or where  
members of the team disagree.  
There are many ways to assess an opportunity. Some companies  
require significant rigor and analysis, and others just leave it to the  
product team’s judgment.  
In this section, I describe three of my favorite techniques, each  
for different-sized efforts\:  
1\. Anopportunity assessment isdesignedforthevastmajorityofprod-  
uctwork,whichrangesfromasimpleoptimizationtoafeatureto  
a medium-sized project.  
2\. A customer letter is designed for larger projects or initiatives  
that often have multiple goals and a more complicated desired  
outcome.  
3\. A startup canvas for those times you’re creating an entirely new  
product line or a new business.  
Note that these techniques are not mutually exclusive. You may  
find it useful to do both an opportunity assessment and a customer  
letter, for example.  
# Problems versus Solutions  
Thereisanunderlyingthemeyou’llseeinallframingtechniques,and  
the reason is that it’s just human nature for people to think and talk  
in terms of solutions rather than the underlying problems. This applies  
especially to users and customers but also applies to stakeholders in  
ourbusiness,othercompanyexecs,andifwe’rehonestwithourselves,  
it very often applies to us as well.

This problem famously  
applies to startup founders.  
Founders will often stew on a  
potentialsolutionformonth,if  
not years, before they get the  
funding and the nerve to pur-  
sue it.  
More often than not, our  
initial solutions don’t solve  
the problem—at least not in  
a way that can power a  
successful business.  
But one of the most important lessons in our industry is to fall  
in love with the problem, not the solution.  
Why is this so important? Because, more often than not, our  
initialsolutionsdon’tsolvetheproblem—atleastnotinawaythatcan  
powerasuccessfulbusiness.Itusuallytakestryingoutseveraldifferent  
approachestoasolutionbeforewefindonethatsolvestheunderlying  
problem.  
This is another reason why typical product roadmaps are so  
problematic.They’relistsoffeaturesandprojectswhereeachfeature  
or project is a possible solution. Somebody believes that feature will  
solve the problem or it wouldn’t be on the roadmap, but it’s all too  
possible they are wrong. It’s not their fault—there’s just no way to  
know at the stage it’s put on the roadmap.  
However, there very likely is a legitimate problem behind that  
potentialsolution,andit’sourjobintheproductorganizationtotease  
out the underlying problem and ensure that whatever solution we  
deliver solves that underlying problem.  
A small amount of time up front framing the problem to be  
solved—and communicating this framing—can make a dramatic  
difference in the results. **CHAPTER**

# Customer Letter Technique  
**F**or smaller and more typically sized efforts, the opportunity  
assessment is usually sufficient. But when embarking on a some-  
what larger effort, there may in fact be multiple reasons, several  
customer problems to be solved, or business objectives to be tackled.  
To communicate the value effectively, it may take more than the four  
questions listed in the previous chapter.  
A typical example of an effort of this size would be a redesign.  
There are likely several objectives in the redesign, and maybe it is  
intended to both improve the experience for current customers and  
perform better for new customers.  
One of my favorite technology-powered product companies is  
Amazon. They have consistently innovated—including several truly  
disruptive innovations—and have shown they can continue to do this  
at scale. In my view, there are many reasons for this ongoing prod-  
uct success, from leadership, to talent, to culture, and especially to  
their sincere passion for taking care of customers. But there are a few  
**183** **184** INSPIRED  
techniques that are central to how  
Amazon builds product, and one of  
them is referred to as the work-  
ing backward process, where you  
start the effort with a pretend press  
release.  
The idea is that the product  
manager frames the work ahead of

somewhat larger effort,

problems to be solved, or

the team by writing an imagined  
pressreleaseofwhatitwouldbelikeoncethisproductlaunches.How  
does it improve the life of our customers? What are the real benefits  
to them? You’ve all read a press release before—the only difference is  
that this is entirely imagined. It is describing a future state we want  
tocreate.  
It’ssotemptingforproductteamstoimmediatelyslipintoanenu-  
meration of all the features they plan to build, with little real thought  
into the actual benefits for our customers. This technique is intended  
to counter that and to keep the team focused on the outcome, not the  
output.  
The actual reader of this press release is the product team,  
related or impacted teams, and leadership. It’s a terrific evangelism  
technique—ifpeopledon’tseethevalueafterreadingthepressrelease,  
then the product manager has more work to do, or perhaps should  
reconsider the effort.  
Some people also consider this a demand-validation technique  
\(ifyoucan’tgetyourteamexcited,maybeit’snotworthdoing\).It’sonly  
validating demand or value with your colleagues rather than with real  
customers, however, so I think of it primarily as a framing technique.  
In any case, Walker Lockhart, a former long-time Amazonian  
who joined Nordstrom a couple of years ago, shared with me a vari-  
ation of this technique that was developed and refined at Nordstrom.  
The idea is that rather than communicate the benefits in a press  
release format, you describe them in the format of a customer let-  
ter written from the hypothetical perspective of one of your product’s  
well-defined user or customer personas.  
The letter—sent to the CEO from a very happy and impressed  
customer—explainswhyheorsheissohappyandgratefulforthenew  
product or redesign. The customer describes how it has changed or Customer Letter Technique **185**  
improvedhisorherlife.Theletteralsoincludesanimaginedcongrat-  
ulatory response from the CEO to the product team explaining how  
this has helped the business.  
Ihopeyoucanseethatthiscustomerlettervariationisverysimilar  
to Amazon’s imagined press release, and it is intended to drive much  
the same type of thinking. A press release version includes a customer  
quote as well.  
I like this customer letter variation even better than the press  
release style for a couple of reasons. First, the press release format is a  
bitdated.Thepressreleasedoesn’tplaytheroleitusedtoinourindus-

thecustomerletterdoesanevenbetterjobofcreatingempathyforthe  
customer’s current pain and more clearly emphasizes to the team how  
their efforts can help the lives of these customers.  
I will also admit that I love actual customer letters. I find them  
to be extremely motivating. And it’s worth noting that even when a  
customer letter is critical of the product, it helps the team to under-  
stand the problem viscerally, and they often feel compelled to find a  
way to help. **CHAPTER**

# Startup Canvas Technique  
**S**o far, we’ve explored techniques for typical-sized, smaller efforts  
like adding a new feature, or medium to large-sized efforts like a  
redesign. Those cover most of what product teams actually work on.  
However, another especially difficult situation requires a more  
comprehensiveframingtechnique.Thisisanearlystagestartup,where  
you are trying to figure out a new product that can power a new busi-  
ness,or,forthosethatworkatanenterprisesizecompany,whenyou’re  
asked to tackle an all-new business opportunity for the company.  
In other words, you’re not being asked to improve an existing  
product, you’re being asked to invent an entirely new product.  
In this situation, you have a much broader set of risks, including  
validatingyourvalueproposition,figuringouthowyouintendtomake  
money, how you plan to get this product out to your customers and  
sell to them, how much it will cost to produce and sell this product,  
and what you will measure to track your progress—not to mention  
determining whether the market is large enough to sustain a business.  
**187** You’re not being asked to  
improve an existing  
product, you’re being asked  
to invent an entirely new  
product.  
**188** INSPIRED  
For decades, people would  
create thick business plans to try to  
highlightthesetopicsandhowthey  
intended to tackle them. But many  
people, including me, have writ-  
ten about the many reasons those  
old business plans were often more  
harmful than helpful.  
A startup canvas, its close cousins the business model canvas, and  
the lean canvas are intended to be lightweight tools to call out these  
risks early and encourage the team to tackle them up front.  
I much prefer the startup canvas to old-style business plans, but  
I have also observed that many startup teams still spend too much  
time on the canvas and keep postponing that pesky little problem of  
discovering a solution that people want to buy \(see the box “The  
Biggest Risk”\).  
You can use a canvas for any product change, no matter the size,  
butyouwouldlikelyquicklyfindthat,onceyouhaveanexistingprod-  
uct and business, the majority of the canvas doesn’t change and is only  
duplicated.Youalreadyhaveasalesordistributionmodel.Youalready  
have a monetization strategy. You have a well-defined cost structure.  
Youaremainlytryingtocreatemorevalueinyoursolution.Inthatcase,  
it probably makes sense for you to look at one of the earlier framing  
techniques.  
That said, you can use the startup canvas for simpler work, espe-  
cially if you have a new product manager. The startup canvas can help  
that new product manager get a good holistic understanding of her  
product and understand the key areas of the affected business.  
# The Biggest Risk  
OneofthethingsIlikeaboutastartupcanvasisthatithelpstoquickly  
highlight the key assumptions and major risks facing a startup or a  
significant new product in an existing business. This is a good thing.  
The idea is to tackle the biggest risks first. At least that’s the theory.  
In practice, I keep running into entrepreneurs and product  
leaders who are focused on secondary risks rather than primary risks.  
\(continued\) Startup Canvas Technique **189**  
\(continued\)  
I think this is at least  
partly because risk is subjec-  
tive and hard to quantify. So,  
depending on your perspec-  
tive, you may think some risk  
is secondary when I think it is  
It’s human nature for  
people to focus more on those  
areas they feel they can

knowledgeable about.  
primary.  
Mostly, however, I think the major reason is that it’s human  
nature for people to focus more on those areas they feel they can  
control and are knowledgeable about.  
So, let’s say your startup founder is someone who comes from  
a business background, probably trained as an MBA. He or she is  
likelyacutelyawareoftherisksassociatedwithcomingupwithagood  
business model. They’re often focused on unique value proposition,  
pricing,channels,andcosts.Theseareallrealrisks,whicharepartof  
assessing business viability.  
But, I will often have to sit these people down and explain that,  
while these are real risks, they are largely academic at this stage. And  
thenItrytopointthematwhat,inmyexperience,isthebiggestreason  
that startups and new products fail.  
You’reprobablythinkingthatI’mspeakingofmarketrisk—that  
the new product is focused on solving a problem that customers just  
don’tcareenoughabout.Thisisaveryrealrisk,andonethat’srespon-  
sible for its share of failed efforts, but I argue this is not usually the  
most significant risk.  
I need to mention a couple caveats here.  
First,IhavetosaythatthevastmajorityoftheteamsImeetare  
not solving truly new problems. They are working on long-standing  
problems with long-proven markets. What’s different about the  
startup or product is their approach to solving the problem \(their  
solution\),mostoften—andincreasingly—becausetheyareleveraging  
newlyavailabletechnologytosolvetheprobleminaninnovativeway.  
Second, if the market is indeed new, then today the techniques  
wehaveforvalidatingdemandhaveneverbeenbetter.Ifyoudon’tuse  
\(continued\) **190** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
thesetechniques,youproceedatyourownperil.Thisisanespecially  
egregious mistake because the techniques are not expensive in terms  
of money and time, so there’s just no excuse not to do this.  
I believe the major risk facing most efforts is value risk. On a  
startupcanvas,thisshowsupundersolutionrisk—discoveringacom-  
pelling solution to customers. A solution that your customers will choose  
to buy and use.  
This is generally hard enough but realize that to get someone  
to switch to our new product, it’s not enough that it’s comparable  
\(sometimes referred to as feature parity\), it must be demonstrably and  
substantially better. This is a high bar.  
However,ifyou’vecreatedacanvasbefore,youknowthatthere’s  
precious little in there about the solution. The official rationale for  
thatisthatit’sfartooeasytofallinlovewithyourparticularapproach  
and lock yourself in prematurely. In fairness, this is a very real issue  
with teams. I see this behavior frequently. But a consequence of this  
meagerrepresentationofthesolutioninacanvasisthatitplaystothe  
tendency of many to focus on those risks they feel more comfortable  
with and leave the solution as “an exercise for the engineers.”  
Rather than delegating or deferring figuring out the solution,  
we need to embrace product discovery as the most important core  
competency of the startup.  
Look, if you can discover a solution that your customers love,  
then you can tackle the risks of monetization and scale. However,  
without that solution, the rest of your work is very likely going to  
be wasted. So, whether your constrained resource is cash or manage-  
ment’spatience,youneedtomakesureyouprimarilyuseyourtimeto  
discover a winning solution. Get that risk resolved first and then you  
can focus on the other risks.

Nowthatwe’veframedourdiscoverywork,we’rereadytojumpinand

helps to have some way to scope out and plan your discovery efforts.  
In this section, I describe two of my favorite discovery-planning  
techniques. One is simple \(story maps\), and the other is fairly com-  
plicated \(customer discovery program\), but they are both remarkably  
powerful and effective.  
I don’t want to scare you away from a technique just because it’s  
a lot of work. I often tell product teams that if they could only pick  
a single technique, the one I’d recommend is the customer discovery  
program. Yes, it’s a lot of time and effort—especially on the shoul-  
ders of the product manager—but it’s my favorite leading indicator of  
futuresuccess.Iattributemuchofthesuccessinmyowncareertothis

# Story Map Technique  
**S**tory maps are one of the most generally useful techniques I know.  
They are essentially a framing and planning technique, but they  
arejustasusefulforideation.Theyarealsousedasadesigntechnique  
when working on prototypes, and they are great for communicating  
with your team and stakeholders. They also play a very practical role  
inmanagingandorganizingyourwork.Further,astorymapishelpful  
throughout product discovery and delivery.  
Ithinkyou’llagreethat’salotofbenefits.Butthebestpartishow  
simple it is.  
The origin of story maps came from frustration with the typi-  
cal flat backlog of user stories. There’s no context, just a prioritized  
list of stories. How can the team know how one story fits in with the  
big picture? What does it mean to even prioritize at that granularity  
with so little context? And what set of stories constitutes a meaningful  
milestone or a release?  
JeffPatton,oneoftheearlyAgilethinkers,wasfrustratedbythis,  
soheleveragedsomeprovenUXdesigntechniques,andadaptedthem  
to Agile concepts and introduced user story maps.  
**193** **194** INSPIRED  
These are two-dimensional  
maps,inwhichmajoruseractivities  
are arrayed along the horizontal  
dimension, loosely ordered by time  
from left to right. So, if there are

a dozen major user activities, they  
would be along the top from left to right, generally in the order you  
would do them—or at least, if you were describing the overall system  
to someone else, the order in which you’d describe them.  
Alongtheverticaldimension,wehaveaprogressivelevelofdetail.  
Aswefleshouteachmajoractivityintosetsofusertasks,weaddstories  
for each of those tasks. The critical tasks are higher vertically than the  
optional tasks.  
If you lay out your system this way, you can, at a glance, get the  
holistic view and consider where to draw the line in terms of different  
releases and their associated objectives.  
Now each story has context. The entire team can see how it fits  
in with the other stories. And not just as a snapshot in time. The team  
can see how the system is expected to grow over time.  
We can use this story map to frame our prototypes, and then as  
we get feedback on our prototypes and learn how people interact with  
our product ideas, we can easily update the story map to serve as a  
living reflection of the prototypes. As we finalize our discovery work  
and progress into delivery, the stories from the map move right into  
the product backlog.  
Many teams I know consider a high-fidelity user prototype and a  
story map as their go-to techniques.

This entire book, in one way or another, is intended to prevent  
or correct this situation. However, in this chapter, I talk about what I

prove we have a strong, viable product and prevent the situation I’ve  
just described.  
# The Power of Reference Customers  
First, we need to talk about the nearly magical power of a happy  
reference customer.  
Let’s be clear about what it  
means to be a reference customer\:  
This is a real customer \(not friends  
or family\), who is running your  
product in production \(not a trial or  
Therearefewthingsmore

prototype\), who has paid realmoney  
fortheproduct\(itwasn’tgivenawaytoenticethemtouseit\),and,most  
important,whoiswillingtotellothershowmuchtheyloveyourproduct  
\(voluntarily and sincerely\).  
Please believe me when I say that there are few things more  
powerful to a product organization than reference customers. It is  
the single best sales tool you can provide to your sales and marketing  
organization, and it completely changes the dynamics between the  
product organization and the rest of the company.  
Ask any good salesperson the single best tool you can provide to  
help her do her job, and she’ll say, “happy reference customers.”  
If you find that you’re constantly frustrated by having to react to  
sales and the latest big-deal prospect they’ve managed to bring in, this  
is how you turn the situation around.  
Without reference customers, it’s very hard for the sales team to  
know where the real product/market fit is. And remember—they have  
a quota and are paid by commission. So, without good examples, they Customer Discovery Program Technique **197**

I will also say that if you do this technique, I consider it the singlebest  
leadingindicatoroffutureproductsuccess.  
I will also say that this technique is not new, although every few  
years some influential person in the product world rediscovers its  
poweranditgetsattentiononceagain.Italsogoesbymultiplenames.  
In any case, I’m convinced that everyone would do the technique if it  
didn’t require so much actual work.

small efforts like features or minor projects. This is for larger efforts.  
Goodexampleswouldbecreatinganewproductorbusiness,takingan  
existing product to a new market or new geography or a redesign of a  
product.  
The basic driver behind this technique is that, with a signifi-  
cant new product, the most common objection is that prospective **198** INSPIRED  
customers want to see that other companies, like themselves, are  
already successfully using the product. They want to see the reference  
customers. In general, the more reference customers the better but  
too few, and the prospective customer is worried that the product is  
a special and only works for those one or two customers.  
For products and services aimed at businesses, I was taught years  
ago that the key number is six reference customers. This is not meant  
to be statistically significant—it is meant to instill confidence—and I  
have found that number has held up over time. Again, more than six  
would be even better, but we shoot for six because each one is a lot  
of work.  
# Single Target Market

that we can help them be successful, and the reference customers are

The concept behind this technique is to focus on developing this  
set of reference customers for a specific target market, which then  
makes it easy for sales to go after those specific types of customers.  
Once we have those reference customers for that initial target market,  
we can move on to expanding the product to meet the needs of the  
next target market. Customer Discovery Program Technique **199**  
# Recruiting the Prospective Reference Customers  
We want to end with six reference customers, so we’ll typically recruit  
between six and eight in case one or two turn out to be not a match or  
unavailable.Weneedthemtobefromthespecifictargetmarketweare  
goingafter.Theymaybefromyourexistingcustomerbase,prospects,  
or a blend.  
We are looking for prospective customers that truly feel the pain  
and are near desperate for the solution we want to build. If they could  
findasolutionthatworkedforthemelsewhere,theywouldhavealready  
bought it.  
However, it’s also important we screen out technologists. These  
people are mainly interested because of the technology, not because  
they desperately need the business value.  
We need them to have people and time willing to work closely  
with us. They need to be willing to spend time with the product  
team, testing out early prototypes and helping the team ensure the  
product works well for them. If possible, we would like them to be  
well-recognized marquee names, because that will be of the most  
value to the sales and marketing staff.  
Coming up with the right set is normally something the prod-  
uct manager does in tight collaboration with the product marketing  
manager.  
# The Relationship  
Thebenefittotheprospectivecustomeristhattheygetrealinput,not  
lip service, to the solution—and, most important, they get a solution  
that truly works for them.  
The benefit to the product team is that you get ready access to a  
set of users and customers that you can go deep with and figure out a  
solution that will work for them. They’ve provided you access to their  
users.Theyhaveagreedtotestearlyversions.And,what’sreallyimpor-  
tant,theyhaveagreedtobuytheproductandserveasapublicreference  
if the resulting product works for them. **200** INSPIRED

to coming up with a product that works extremely well for them and  
just a handful of other companies.  
Further,yourjobasproductmanagerisnottoputinthefeatures  
that all six companies request. While that would be much easier, that  
would yield an awful product. Your job is to dive deep with each of  
thesixcustomersandidentifyasinglesolutionthatworkswellforallsix  
customers.  
There are a number of important points to consider with this  
technique.  
Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I don’t personally like  
the customer to pay in advance to participate in this program. That  
makesthisadifferenttypeofrelationship.Youwantapartnerincoming

after you deliver them a product they love. That said, if you’re a very  
early stage startup with little cash, you may have to bend this rule just  
a bit. A compromise is to have them put the money into escrow.  
Ifyouareworkingonanimportantanddifficultproblem,youwill  
likelybeoverwhelmedwithcustomersthatwanttoparticipate.Itreally  
is a good deal, and customers know this. If you have a sales organiza-

you’llbeleanedontoincludemanymorecustomersthanyoucanhan-  
dle.Thiswilltakefinesseattimes,butit’simportantthatthemembers  
of the customer discovery program be the right set, and no more than  
eight. However, it’s no problem also having an early release program  
that is essentially unlimited for those customers that want the soft-  
ware early, but you determine aren’t right for the customer discovery  
program.  
Note that, in many cases, you’ll get people who say they are  
extremely interested in this product, but they first want to see your  
references. When you explain you’re looking to work with them to Customer Discovery Program Technique **201**  
become one of those references, they will probably say they are just  
too busy, but to come back once you have the references. That’s fine.  
They’re a useful lead. But we are looking for those customers that  
are so hungry and desperate for a solution that they will absolutely  
make time for this. Every market has this segment.  
That said, if you find you are having real trouble recruiting even

Youneedtomakesureyourcustomersaretrulyfromyourtarget  
marketandnotmorethanonetargetmarket.Abigbenefitofthispro-

to keep your product marketing partner continuously involved in this

actual reference customers—so be sure you deliver a product they

Think of these early prospective customers as development part-  
ners. You’re in this together. You need to treat them as colleagues—  
open the kimono, you are helping each other. You’ll find that the  
relationships you create can last for many years.  
You will be interacting with these people throughout the  
effort—you’ll be showing them prototypes and testing with their  
users, you’ll be asking many detailed questions, and you’ll be testing  
early versions in their environment.  
Makesureyoureleasethedeliveredproducttothesepeoplebefore  
the general release, and make sure they are live and happy before the

Now let’s consider the common variations of this program for  
different types of products. **202** INSPIRED  
# Platform/API Products  
Fordeveloperproducts,theprogramisverymuchliketheoneforbusi-  
nesses, but the main difference is that we work with the development  
teams \(engineers and product managers\) that will use our APIs to get  
themsuccessfullyusingourproduct.Theresultoftheprogramisaset  
of reference applicationsrather than reference customers. We focus on  
the successful applications created with our APIs.  
# Customer-Enabling Tools  
For customer-enabling tools, such as a new dashboard for your cus-  
tomer service agents, we pick six to eight well-respected, influential  
internal users/employees—the individuals that the other agents look  
up to as thought leaders—and we work closely with them to discover  
thenecessaryproduct.Obviously,theyarenotcustomersandnotpay-  
ing anything, but insteadwe ask them to work closelywith us through  
product discovery to make this tool great. Once they believe that the  
product is ready, we ask them to tell their colleagues how much they  
love the new tool.  
# Consumer Products  
For consumer products, the same general concept applies. But, rather  
than focusing on six businesses to work closely with \(where we have  
accesstomanydifferentusersateachcustomer\),weinsteadfocusona  
somewhatlargernumberofconsumers\(ontheorderof10–50\)thatwe  
engage with to get them to the point that they are loving our product.  
It’s important to emphasize that, for consumer products, we will  
need to supplement this program with much broader testing of our  
product ideas—typically with people that have never been exposed to  
the product. But it is often very helpful to have a smaller group of  
prospective users that we can go back to over time, and that’s what  
this is for. Customer Discovery Program Technique **203**  
In terms of marketing, when a consumer decides to buy or use a  
product, they may not look at reference customers as a business pur-  
chaserwould.Buttheyareaffectedbysocialmedia,thepress,andother

the first thing they’ll look for is real users.  
# Summary  
Whileyoucanseethismaybealotofeffort,especiallyfortheproduct

product that customers love.  
Rememberthatthistechniqueisnotdesignedtodiscoverthenec-  
essary product—that comes next. Rather, it is designed to give you

# Defining Product/Market Fit  
There are many ways of defin-  
ing this critically important  
concept of product/market fit.  
Unfortunately, most of them  
are largely subjective.  
It is true that prod-  
Product/marketfitshows  
upintermsofhappier  
customers,lowerchurn  
rates,shortenedsalescycles,  
andrapidorganicgrowth.  
uct/market fit is one of those  
things that “you know it when you see it.” It certainly shows up in  
termsofhappiercustomers,lowerchurnrates,shortenedsalescycles,  
and rapid organic growth. But the threshold for any of these can be  
tough to define.  
Companies often spend countless hours debating what  
product/market fit should mean for them and whether they have  
achieved it.  
One of the most common techniques for assessing prod-  
uct/marketfitisknownastheSeanEllistest.Thisinvolvessurveying  
\(continued\) **204** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
your users \(those in your target market that have used the product  
recently,atleastacoupletimes,andyouknowfromtheanalyticsthat  
they’ve at least made it through to the core value of the product\) and  
asking them how they’d feel if they could no longer use this product.  
\(The choices are “very disappointed,” “somewhat disappointed,”  
“don’t care,” and “no longer relevant because I no longer use.”\). The  
general rule of thumb is that if more than 40 percent of the users  
would be “very disappointed,” then there’s a good chance you’re at  
product/market fit.  
While useful, as you might imagine there are lots of caveats  
here, depending on the type of product and the size of the sample.  
I like this test for consumer products and services, but for products  
for businesses, one of the reasons I like this customer discovery pro-  
gramsomuchisthatIconsiderthisaverypracticalandveryeffective  
definition of product/market fit.  
Ifwecangettothepointwherewehavesixreferencecustomers

for that market.  
Rememberproduct/marketfitdoesnotmeanthatyouaredone  
with working on that product. Not even close. We will continue to  
improvethatproduct continuously foryears.However,once we have  
those six reference customers, we can aggressively and effectively sell  
that product to other customers in that market.  
So,eachreferencecustomerisatrulysignificantmilestone.But,  
for example, getting six reference customers in a given target market  
for a B2B company is perhaps the most significant, meaningful mile-  
stone business result for a product organization and something truly  
worth celebrating. **CHAPTER**

# Profile\: Martina Lauchengco  
# of Microsoft  
**I**n 1993, Word 6.0 was the biggest release, feature-wise, Microsoft  
had ever produced.  
In addition to all the new features, the team had another very  
large objective. Their code base had diverged, and it was extremely  
slow and costly for Microsoft to implement Word separately for each  
platform\:Windows,DOS,andMac.Thiscodeconvergenceeffortwas  
supposed to save Microsoft substantial development time, and—they  
triedtoconvincethemselves—improvetheofferingsinceWordwould  
have the same features on every platform.  
It also meant that there was great pressure to get the release out  
so they could start to gain the efficiencies of a single code base.  
At the time, Word for Mac was a relatively small market. It was  
only \$60 million, versus Windows, which at that point was more than  
a \$1 billion market. If you remember, back then Windows machines  
absolutely dominated, and the future of Apple was not a sure thing.  
However, the Mac community was also very vocal—with passionate  
**205** **206** INSPIRED  
fans of their platform—and this community had very little love for  
Microsoft.  
PowerMacs were just hitting the market, which had significantly  
faster chips and more memory. Most of the team members were using  
those new computers because the Word 6.0 beta in its early days was  
just too slow on regular Macs. Of course, most of the Mac user base  
was not on new PowerMacs—they were on regular Macs. Hardware  
upgrade cycles were much slower then.  
So, when Microsoft released the most "full-featured word pro-  
cessor ever for the Mac," it crawled on their Macs—we’re talking two  
minutes just to start it up.  
The community immediately started posting in newsgroups that  
Microsoft was trying to “kill the Mac.” Hate mail started streaming in  
from everywhere, including e-mails directly to Bill Gates, who would  
forward them to the team with messages like “This is depressing  
MSFT’s stock price. Fix it.”  
Enter Martina Lauchengco, a young product manager recently  
out of Stanford, whose job it was to help turn this around.  
The team quickly learned that, while it may be a worthwhile  
objective to get to a common code base, it’s an empty victory if  
the product that results is not good. Moreover, users choose their  
devices and platforms because they value what’s different, not what’s  
the same. From the customer’s point of view, they would rather  
wait a little longer and have a better platform-specific solution, than  
simultaneously ship a generic product on all platforms.  
The team ended up focusing hard on performance and taking  
advantageofwhattheMaccoulddo.Theylookedatwhenandhowto  
loadfonts,sinceMacuserstendedtohavesomanymorethanWindows  
users, and ensuring all Mac keyboard shortcuts still worked.  
They focused on word count—which is used 10 times a day by  
everypressperson—tomakesurethatitwaslightningfast,asthepress  
used the feature as their performance barometer. They even made it  
faster than the feature on Windows.  
The result was that in a couple of months they produced a  
6.1 release that was sent to every registered user with an apology  
letter—signed by Martina—along with a discount coupon for future  
purchases. **207**

hard it can be to do the right thing  
for the customer, often in the face of massive pressures. But that’s  
exactly what strong product managers figure out how to do.  
In subsequent years, not only did Microsoft once again decide  
to diverge the code base, they completely separated the teams into  
different buildings and business units and had them fully embrace all  
things Mac. Strategically, it was a complete 180.  
It’s hard to estimate how important this was to both Microsoft  
and Apple. Even today, more than 20 years later, many businesses and  
consumers consider Word and the rest of Office absolutely essential  
to using their Mac for business and personal use. What started then  
became a multibillion-dollar win for both Apple and Microsoft.  
There are more than 1 billion Macs and PCs running Office around  
the world.

# Overview  
Thereare,ofcourse,anynumberoftechniquesforgeneratingproduct

to me, the more relevant question is, “How do we generate the types  
ofideasthatarelikelytotrulyhelpussolvethehardbusinessproblems  
that our leaders have asked us to focus on right now?”  
Remarkably, in the vast majority of companies \(not the ones  
that are good at product\), the actual product teams don’t do much  
ideation themselves. This is because what’s really going on is that  
the ideas are already handed to the product teams in the form of  
prioritized features on product roadmaps, where most of the items on  
those roadmaps are coming either from requests from big customers  
\(or prospective customers\), or from company stakeholders or execs.  
Unfortunately, these are rarely the quality of ideas we’re looking for.  
In general, if the product team is given actual business problems

# Customer Interviews  
**T**he customer interview is the most basic technique I’ll discuss in  
this book. I wish I didn’t need to include it because I’d like to be  
able to take it for granted that product managers already know how to  
do this well and do it frequently.  
However, the reality is that this is often not the case. Or, if cus-  
tomer interviews are happening, the product manager is not present,  
so the learnings are not understood viscerally or taken as seriously as  
they need to be \(see Discovery Principle \#10 on shared learning\).  
But no question, this is one of the most powerful and important  
skillsforanyproductmanagerandveryoftenthesourceorinspiration

the contextual inquiry\), and others  
are more about just getting out of  
the building and learning what you  
don’t know.  
But in every user or customer  
interaction, we always have the  
opportunity to learn some valuable  
insights. Here’s what I’m always  
trying to understand\:  
• Are your customers who you think they are?  
• Do they really have the problems you think they have?  
• How does the customer solve this problem today?  
• What would be required for them to switch?  
Now there are lots of ways to get these answers, and if you have  
accesstoauserresearcher,youwouldnormallyfollowtheirlead.Here  
are some tips for getting the most out of these learning opportunities\:  
Frequency. Establisharegularcadenceofcustomerinterviews.This  
shouldnotbeaonce-in-a-whilething.Abareminimumwouldbe  
two to three hours of customer interviews per week, every week.  
Purpose. You are not trying to prove anything during these inter-  
views, one way or the other. You’re just trying to understand and  
learn quickly. This mindset is critical and needs to be sincere.  
Recruiting users and customers. I talk much more about this  
when we discuss the usability testing technique, but for now, be  
sure to talk primarily to people in your intended target market.  
You’re looking for about an hour of their time.  
Location. It’s always amazing to see customers in their native habi-  
tat.There’ssomuchtolearnjustbyobservingtheirenvironment.  
But it’s also fine to meet them somewhere convenient or have  
themcometoyouroffice.Ifyouneedtodothisoveravideocall,  
that’s not as good, but much better than not doing at all.  
Preparation. Beclearbeforehandwhatproblemitisyouthinkthey  
have,andthinkabouthowyou’lleitherconfirmorcontradictthat. Customer Interviews **213**  
Who should attend. My favorite is to bring three people to these  
interviews\: the product manager, the product designer, and one  
of the engineers from the team \(we normally rotate among  
those that want to attend\). Usually, the designer drives \(because  
they’ve usually been trained how to do this well\), the product  
manager takes notes, and the developer observes.  
Interview. Work to keep things natural and informal, ask  
open-ended questions, and try to learn what they’re doing  
today \(not so much what they wish they were doing, although  
that’s also interesting\).  
Afterward. Debrief with your colleagues to see if you’ve all heard  
the same things and had the same learnings. If you made any  
promises to the customer during that session, be sure you keep  
them.  
I would argue that this hour consistently yields a great return on

you will see the techniques for this. But for now, just know that

# Concierge Test Technique  
**A**concierge test is one of my favorite techniques for  
quickly generating high-quality product ideas and, at the  
same time, working on developing the customer understanding and  
empathy that’s so important for motivating the team and delivering  
strong solutions.  
A concierge test is a relatively new name to describe an old but  
effective technique. The idea is that we do the customer’s job for  
them—manuallyandpersonally.Justasifyouwenttoahotelconcierge  
and asked if he could find you some theater tickets to a popular show.  
You don’t really know the details of what that concierge is doing for  
you to get those tickets, but you do know that he is doing something.  
With this technique, you become the concierge. You do what the  
user or customer needs done for them. You may have to ask them to  
trainyoufirst,butyouareintheirshoesdoingthetaskstheywoulddo.  
**215** A concierge test requires  
going out to the actual users  
and customers and asking  
them to show you how they  
work so that you can learn  
how to do their job, and so  
that you can work on  
providing them a much  
better solution.  
**216** INSPIRED  
This is similar, but not the  
same, as spending some time with  
your customer service or customer  
success staff. That is also valuable,  
and often a good source of prod-  
uct ideas as well, but that is help-  
ing customers once they call with a  
problem.

# The Power of Customer  
# Misbehavior  
**H**istorically,thetwomainapproachesusedbygoodteamstocome  
up with product opportunities have been\:  
1\. Try to assess the market opportunities and pick potentially  
lucrative areas where significant pain exists.  
2\. Look at what the technology or data enables—what’s just now  
possible—and match that up with the significant pain.  
You can think of the first as following the market, and the sec-  
ond as following the technology. Either way can get you to a winning  
product.  
However,someofthemostsuccessfulcompaniestodayhavetaken

This third alternative is to  
allow, and even encourage, our  
customers to use our products to  
solve problems other than what we  
planned for and officially support.

PowerofCustomerMisbehavior. This  
book tells the eBay and Facebook stories from a viral growth perspec-  
tive, but there are several other very good examples in there, too.  
From its earliest days, eBay has always had an “Everything Else”  
category.ThisiswherepeoplecouldbuyandsellthingsthatweateBay  
couldn’t anticipate people might want to trade. And while we antici-  
pated a lot \(there were and still are thousands of categories\), some of  
the biggest innovations and biggest surprises came from monitoring  
what customers wantedto do.  
We realized early on in the eBay situation that this was where  
much of the best innovation was happening, and we did everything  
we could think of to encourage and nurture customers using the eBay  
marketplace to be able to buy and sell nearly anything.  
Whilethemarketplacemayhavebeenoriginallydesignedtofacil-  
itatetradingitemslikeelectronicsandcollectibles,soonpeoplestarted

is one of the largest used car companies in the world.  
Asyoumightimagine,therearesomeverysignificantdifferences

same concept is what’s behind  
the trend toward exposing

some or all of a product’s ser-

With a public API, you are essentially saying to the developer  
community,“Thesearethethingswecando—perhapsyoucanlever-  
agetheseservicestodosomethingamazingthatwecouldn’tanticipate  
ourselves.”  
Facebook’s platform strategy is a good example of this. They  
opened up access to their social graph to discover the types of things  
thatdevelopersmightbeabletodooncetheycouldleveragethisasset.  
I have been a long-time fan of public APIs as a part of a  
company’s product strategy. I consider developers to be one of  
the consistently best sources of truly innovative product ideas.  
Developers are in the best position to see what’s just now possible,  
and so many innovations are powered by these insights. **CHAPTER**

# Hack Days  
**T**here are many variations of hack days, but in this chapter, I  
describe one of my favorite techniques to quickly get a range of  
high-potential ideas that are focused on solving a pressing business or  
customer problem.  
The two main types of hack days are directed and undirected. In

assigned \(for example, “Reduce the

ask people from the product teams to self-organize and work on any  
ideas they like that might address this objective.  
**221** **222** INSPIRED  
The goal is for the self-organizing groups to explore their ideas  
and create some form of prototype that can be evaluated, and if  
appropriate, tested on actual users.  
There are two major benefits to these directed hack days. The  
first is practical, as the technique facilitates the inclusion of engineers  
at ideation. I’ve mentioned several times in this book that many of the

# Feasibility Prototypes  
These are written by engineers to address technical feasibility risks  
during product discovery—before we decide whether something is  
feasible. Sometimes, the engineers are trying out a new technology.  
Sometimes it’s a new algorithm. Often it is about assessing perfor-  
mance. The idea is for the developer to write just enough code to be  
able to address the feasibility risk.  
# User Prototypes  
User prototypes are simulations. There is a wide spectrum of user  
prototypes—fromthoseintentionallydesignedtolooklikewireframes  
sketched out on paper \(referred to as low-fidelityuserprototypes\) all the  
way up to those that look and feel like the real thing \(referred to as  
high-fidelity user prototypes\), where it can be difficult to tell it’s just a  
simulation.  
# Live-Data Prototypes  
Live-dataprototypesarealittlemorecomplicatedtoexplain,butthey  
areacriticallyimportanttoolforseveralsituations.Themainpurpose  
of a live-data prototype is to collect actual data so we can prove some-  
thing, or at least gather some evidence—normally to find out whether  
an idea \(a feature, a design approach, a workflow\) really works. This  
typically means two things. First, we need the prototype to access our  
livedatasources,andsecond,weneedtobeabletosendlivetraffic—in  
enough quantity to get some useful data—to the prototype.  
The key is that we don’t want to have to build, test, and deploy a  
commercially viable product to do this. That would take far too long,  
cost far too much, and very likely yield huge waste. A live-data proto-

# Principles of Prototypes  
**A**s discussed in Chapter 44, there are many forms of prototypes.  
Thebestchoiceforyoudependsontheparticularriskbeingtack-  
led and the type of product. But all forms of prototypes have certain  
characteristics and benefits in common. Here are five key principles  
behind their use.  
1\. The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn  
something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than  
building out a product. All forms of prototype should require at  
least an order of magnitude less time and effort as the eventual  
product.  
2\. Realize that one of the key benefits of any form of prototype is  
to force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper  
level than if we just talk about it or write something down. This  
iswhytheveryactofcreatingaprototypesooftenexposesmajor  
issues otherwise left uncovered until much later.

4\. There are many different pos-  
siblelevelsoffidelityforaprototype.Thefidelityprimarilyrefers  
tohowrealistictheprototypelooks.Thereisnosuchthingasone  
appropriate level of fidelity. Sometimes we don’t need the proto-  
type to look realistic at all, and other times it needs to be very  
realistic. The principle is that we create the rightlevel of fidelity  
for its intended purpose, and we acknowledge that lower fidelity  
is faster and cheaper than higher fidelity, so we only do higher  
fidelity when we need to.  
5\. The primary purpose of a prototype is to tackle one or more  
productrisks\(value,usability,feasibility,orviability\)indiscovery;  
however, in many cases, the prototype goes on to provide a  
second benefit, which is to communicate to the engineers and  
the broader organization what needs to be built. This is often  
referred to as prototype as spec. In many cases, the prototype  
is sufficient for this, but in other cases—especially when the  
engineers are not co-located or when the product is especially  
complex—the prototype will likely need to be supplemented  
with additional details \(usually, use cases, business rules, and  
acceptance criteria\). **CHAPTER**  
# 46  
# Feasibility Prototype  
# Technique  
**M**ost of the time your engineers will review your product ideas  
and tell you that they have no real concerns about feasibility.  
Thisisbecausetheyhavelikelybuiltsimilarthingsmanytimesbefore.  
However, there are several situations wherein your engineers  
mayidentifyasignificantfeasibilityriskinvolvedinsolvingaparticular  
problem they are working on. Common examples include\:  
• Algorithm concerns  
• Performance concerns  
• Scalability concerns  
• Fault tolerance concerns  
• Use of a technology the team has not used before  
• Use of a third-party component or service the team has not used  
before  
**229** The idea is to write just  
enough code to mitigate the  
feasibility risk.  
**230** INSPIRED  
• Use of a legacy system the  
team has not used before  
• Dependency on new or related  
changes by other teams  
The main technique used for tackling these types of risks is for  
one or more of the engineers to build a feasibility prototype.  
Anengineerwillcreatethefeasibilityprototypebecauseitistyp-  
ically code \(as opposed to most prototypes created by special-purpose  
tools intended to be used by product designers\). A feasibility proto-  
type is a long way from a commercially shippable product—the idea  
is to write just enough code to mitigate the feasibility risk. This typ-  
ically represents just a small percentage of the work for the eventual  
shippable product.  
Further, most of the time the feasibility prototype is intended to  
be throwaway code—it’s okay and normal to be quick and dirty with  
this. It is intended to be just enough to collect the data, for example,  
to show that performance would likely be acceptable or not. There is  
usually no user interface, error handling, or any of the typical work  
involved in productization.  
In my experience, building a feasibility prototype requires  
usually just a day or two of time. If you’re exploring a major new  
technology,suchasanewapproachleveragingmachine-learningtech-  
nology,thenthefeasibilityprototypecouldverywelltakesignificantly  
longer.  
The amount of time the feasibility prototype is estimated to take  
comes from the engineers, but whether or not the team takes that  
time depends on the product manager’s judgment call as to whether  
it’s worth pursuing this idea. She might say many other approaches to  
this problem don’t have the technology feasibility risk, so she would  
rather skip this idea.  
Whileit’stheengineerswhodothisfeasibilityprototypingwork,  
it is considered discovery work and not delivery work. It’s done as  
part of deciding whether to even pursue this particular approach  
or idea.  
In terms of lessons learned, I have seen many teams proceed to  
deliverywithoutadequatelyconsideringthefeasibilityrisk.Whenever Feasibility Prototype Technique **231**

# User Prototype Technique  
**A**user prototype—one of the most powerful tools in product  
discovery—is a simulation. Smoke and mirrors. It’s all a façade.  
There is nothing behind the curtain. In other words, if you have a  
user prototype of an e-commerce site, you can enter your credit card  
information as many times as you want—you won’t actually be buying  
anything.  
There is a wide range of user prototypes.  
At one end of the spectrum are low-fidelity user prototypes.  
A low-fidelity user prototype doesn’t look real—it is essentially an  
interactivewireframe.Manyteamsusetheseasawaytothinkthrough  
the product among themselves, but there are other uses as well.  
Low-fidelityuserprototypes,however,representonlyonedimen-  
sion of your product—the information and the workflow—there’s  
nothing there about the impact of visual design or the differences  
caused by the actual data, to mention just a couple of important  
examples.  
At the other end of the spectrum are high-fidelity user proto-  
types.Ahigh-fidelityuserprototypeisstillasimulation;however,now  
it looks and feels very real. In fact, with many good high-fidelity user  
**233** **234** INSPIRED  
prototypes, you need to look close  
to see that it’s not real. The data  
you see is very realistic, but it’s  
notrealeither—mostlymeaningit’s  
not live.  
For example, if in my  
A user prototype is key to  
several types of validation  
and is also one of our  
most important  
communication tools.  
e-commerce user prototype exam-  
ple, I do a search for a particular type of mountain bike, it always  
comes back with the same set of mountain bikes. But if I look closely,  
they’re not the actual bikes I asked for. And I notice that every time  
I search, it’s always the same set of bikes no matter what price or style  
I specify.  
If you are trying to test the relevance of the search results,  
this would not be the right tool for the job. But if you are trying to  
come up with a good overall shopping experience or figure out how  
people want to search for mountain bikes, this is probably more than  
adequate, and it’s very quick and easy to create.  
Therearemanytoolsforcreatinguserprototypes—foreverytype  
ofdevice,andforeveryleveloffidelity.Thetoolsaremainlydeveloped  
for product designers. In fact, your product designer almost certainly  
already has one or more favorite user prototyping tools.  
It’s also the case that some designers prefer to hand-code their  
high-fidelityuserprototypes,whichisfinesolongastheyarefast,and  
they are willing to treat the prototype as disposable.  
The big limitation of a user prototype is that it’s not good for  
proving anything—like whether or not your product will sell.  
Where a lot of novice product people go sideways is when they  
create a high-fidelity user prototype and they put it in front of 10  
or 15 people who all say how much they love it. They think they’ve  
validated their product, but unfortunately, that’s not how it works.  
People say all kinds of things and then go do something different.  
We have much better techniques for validating value, so  
it’s important that you understand what a user prototype is not  
appropriate for.  
This is one of the most important techniques for product teams,  
so it is well worth developing your team’s skills and experience in cre-  
atinguserprototypesatalllevelsoffidelity.Asyou’llseeinthecoming  
chapters, a user prototype is key to several types of validation and is  
also one of our most important communication tools. **CHAPTER**  
# 48  
# Live-Data Prototype  
# Technique  
**S**ometimes, in order to address a major risk identified in discovery,  
we need to be able to collect some actual usage data. But we need  
to collect this evidence while in discovery, well before taking the time  
and expense of building an actual scalable and shippable product.  
Some of my favorite examples of this are when applying game  
dynamics, search result relevance, many social features, and product  
funnel work.  
This is the purpose of a live-data prototype.  
A live-dataprototypeis a very limited implementation. It typically  
hasnoneoftheproductizationthat’snormallyrequired,suchasthefull  
setofusecases,automatedtests,fullanalyticsinstrumentation,interna-  
tionalization and localization, performance and scalability, SEO work,

internationalization and localiza-  
tion work, they don’t tackle performance or scalability, they don’t  
create the automated tests, and they only include instrumentation for  
the specific use cases we’re testing.  
Alive-dataprototypeisjustasmallfractionoftheproductization  
effort \(in my experience, somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the  
eventual delivery productization work\), but you get big value from it.  
There are two big limitations you do have to keep in mind, however\:  
• First, this is code, so engineers must create the live-data  
prototype, not your designers.  
• Second, this is not a commercially shippable product, it’s not  
ready for primetime, and you can’t run a business on it. So, if  
the live-data tests go well, and you decide to move forward and  
productize, you will need to allow your engineers to take the  
time required to do the necessary delivery work. It is definitely  
notokay for the product manager to tell the engineers that this is  
“goodenough.”Thatjudgmentisnotuptotheproductmanager.  
And the product manager does need to make sure key executives  
and stakeholders understand the limitations as well.

once we have it we can iterate very quickly.  
Later, we’ll discuss the quantitative-validation techniques and  
you’llseethedifferentwayswecanutilizethislive-dataprototype.But  
for now, know that the key is to be able to send some limited amount  
of traffic, and to collect analytics on how this live-data prototype is  
being used. Live-Data Prototype Technique **237**  
What’s important is that actual users will use the live-data proto-  
type for real work, and this will generate real data \(analytics\) that we  
cancomparetoourcurrentproduct—ortoourexpectations—toseeif  
this new approach performs better. **CHAPTER**  
# 49  
# Hybrid Prototype Technique  
**S**o far, we’ve explored user prototypes—which are pure  
simulations—feasibility prototypes for addressing technical  
risks, and live-data prototypes designed to be able to collect evidence,  
or even statistically significant proof, as to the effectiveness of a  
product or an idea.  
Whilethesethreecategoriesofprototypeshandlemostsituations  
well,awidevarietyofhybridprototypesalsocombinedifferentaspects  
of each of these in different ways.  
One of my favorite examples of a hybrid prototype—and  
an exceptionally powerful tool for learning quickly in product  
discovery—is today often referred to as a Wizard of Oz prototype. A  
Wizard of Oz prototype combines the front-end user experience of  
a high-fidelity user prototype but with an actual person behind the  
scenes performing manually what would ultimately be handled by  
automation.  
AWizardofOzprototypeisabsolutely notscalable,andwewould  
neversendanysignificantamountoftraffictothis.Butthebenefitfrom  
our perspective is that we can create this very quickly and easily, and  
from the user’s perspective, it looks and behaves like a real product.

For example, imagine that  
today you have some sort of live

but it’s only available during the  
hours when your customer service  
staff is in the office. You know that

discovery.  
your customers use your product

You could \(and should\) talk to your customer service staff about  
the types of inquiries they routinely get and how they respond \(a  
concierge test could help you learn that quickly\). Soon you will want to  
tackle the challenges of this sort of automation.  
One way to learn very quickly and test out several different  
approaches is to create a Wizard of Oz prototype that provides a  
simple, chat-based interface. However, behind the scenes it is literally  
you as product manager, or another member of your team, who is  
receiving the requests and composing responses. Soon we begin to  
experiment with system-generated responses, perhaps even using a  
live-data prototype of our algorithm.

# Discovery Testing  
# Techniques  
# Overview  
In product discovery, we’re essentially trying to quickly separate  
the good ideas from the bad as we work to try to solve the business  
problems assigned to us. But what does that really mean?  
Wethinkoffourtypesofquestionswe’retryingtoanswerduring  
discovery\:  
1\. Will the user or customer choose to use or buy this? \(Value\)  
2\. Can the user figure out how to use this? \(Usability\)  
3\. Can we build this? \(Feasibility\)  
4\. Is this solution viable for our business? \(Business viability\)  
Remember that for many of the things we work on, most or all  
of these questions are very straightforward and low risk. Your team is  
confident.Theyhavebeenthereanddonethismanytimesbefore,and  
so we will proceed to delivery.  
The main activity of discovery is when these answers are not  
so clear.  
There is no prescribed order to answering these questions.  
However, many teams follow a certain logic.  
First, we will usually assess value. This is often the toughest—  
and most important—question to answer, and if the value isn’t there,  
not much else matters. We likely will need to address usability before In product discovery, we’re  
essentially trying to quickly  
separate the good ideas from  
**242** INSPIRED  
the user or customer can even rec-  
ognize the value. In either case, we  
usually assess usability and value  
with the same users and customers  
at the same time.  
Once we have something  
that our customers believe is truly  
the bad as we work to try to  
solve the business problems  
assigned to us.  
valuable,andwehavedesigneditin  
a way that we believe our users can figure out how to use, then we’ll  
typically review the approach with the engineers to make sure this is  
doable from their technical feasibility perspective.  
If we’re also good on feasibility, then we’ll show it to key parts  
of the business where there may be concerns \(think legal, marketing,  
sales, CEO, etc.\). We’ll often address these business risks last because  
we don’t want to stir up the organization unless we’re confident it’s  
worthwhile. Also, sometimes the ideas that survive are not so similar  
to the original ideas that we started with, and those original ideas may  
have come from a business stakeholder. It’s much more effective to be  
able to show that stakeholder some evidence of what did and didn’t  
work with customers and why and how you ended up where you are. **CHAPTER**  
# 50  
# Testing Usability  
**U**sability testing is typically the most mature and straightforward  
form of discovery testing, and it has existed for many years. The  
toolsarebetterandteamsdomuchmoreofthisnowthantheyusedto,  
and this is not rocket science. The main difference today is that we do  
usability testing in discovery—using prototypes, before we build the  
product—and not at the end, where it’s really too late to correct the  
issues without significant waste or worse.  
If your company is large enough to have its own user research  
group, by all means secure as much of their time for your team as you  
absolutely can. Even if you can’t get much of their time, these people  
are often terrific resources, and if you can make a friend in this group,  
it can be a huge help to you.  
Ifyourorganizationhasfundsearmarkedforoutsideservices,you  
may be able to use one of many user research firms to conduct the  
testing for you. But at the price that most firms charge, chances are  
that you won’t be able to afford nearly as much of this type of testing  
asyourproductwillneed.Ifyou’relikemostcompanies,youhavefew

So, I’ll show you how to do this testing yourself.

No, you won’t be as proficient as a trained user researcher—at

and friction points with your product, which is what’s important.  
There are several excellent books that describe how to conduct  
informalusabilitytesting,soIwon’ttrytorecreatethosehere.Instead,  
I’ll just emphasize the key points.  
# Recruiting Users to Test  
You’ll need to round up some test subjects. If you’re using a user  
research group, they’ll likely recruit and schedule the users for you,  
which is a huge help, but if you’re on your own, you’ve got several  
options\:  
• Ifyou’veestablishedthecustomer-discoveryprogramIdescribed

anSEMcampaignusingGoogleAdWordstorecruitusers\(which  
isespeciallygoodifyouarelookingforusersthatareinthemoment  
of trying to use a product like yours\).  
• If you have a list of e-mail addresses of your users, you can do a  
selection from there. Your product marketing manager often can  
help you narrow down the list.  
• You can solicit volunteers on your company website—lots of  
major companies do this now. Remember that you’ll still call and  
screen the volunteers to make sure the people you select are in  
your target market.  
• You can always go to where your users congregate. Trade shows  
for business software, shopping centers for e-commerce, sports  
bars for fantasy sports—you get the idea. If your product is  
addressing a real need, you usually won’t have trouble getting  
people to give you an hour. Bring some thank-you gifts.  
• If you’re asking users to come to your location, you will likely  
needtocompensatethemfortheirtime.Weoftenwillarrangeto Testing Usability **245**  
meet the test subject at a mutually convenient location, such as a  
Starbucks. This practice is so common it’s usually referred to as  
Starbuckstesting.  
# Preparing the Test  
• We usually do usability testing with a high-fidelity user prototype.  
You can get some useful usability feedback with a low- or  
medium-fidelity user prototype, but for the value testing that  
typically follows usability testing, we need the product to be  
more realistic \(more on why later\).  
• Mostofthetime,whenwedoausabilityand/orvaluetest,it’swith  
the product manager, the product designer, and one of the engi-  
neers from the team \(from those that like to attend these\). I like  
to rotate among the engineers. As I mentioned earlier, the magic  
often happens when an engineer is present, so I try to encourage  
thatwheneverpossible.Ifyouhaveauserresearcherhelpingwith  
theactualtesting,theywilltypicallyadministerthetest,butabso-  
lutely the product manager and designer must be there for each  
and every test.  
• You will need to define in advance the set of tasks that you want  
to test. Usually, these are fairly obvious. If, for example, you’re  
building an alarm clock app for a mobile device, your users will  
needtodothingslikesetanalarm,findandhitthesnoozebutton,  
andsoon.Theremayalsobemoreobscuretasks,butconcentrate  
ontheprimarytasks—theonesthatuserswilldomostofthetime.  
• Somepeoplestillbelievethattheproductmanagerandtheprod-  
uctdesigneraretooclosetotheproducttodothistypeoftesting  
objectively, and they may either get their feelings hurt or only  
hear what they want to hear. We get past this obstacle in two  
ways. First, we train the product managers and designers on how  
toconductthemselves,andsecond,wemakesurethetesthappens  
quickly—beforetheyfallinlovewiththeirownideas.Goodprod-  
uct managers know they will get the product wrong initially and  
that nobody gets it right the first time. They know that learning  
from these tests is the fastest path to a successful product.  
• You should have one person administer the usability test and  
another person taking notes. It’s helpful to have at least one **246** INSPIRED  
otherpersontodebriefwithafterwardtomakesureyoubothsaw  
the same things and came to the same conclusions.  
• Formal testing labs will typically have setups with two-way mir-  
rors or closed-circuit video monitors with cameras that capture  
both the screen and the user from the front. This is fine if you  
have it, but I can’t count how many prototypes I’ve tested at a  
tiny table at Starbucks—just big enough for three or four chairs  
around the table. In fact, in many ways, this is preferable to the  
testing lab because the user feels a lot less like a lab rat.  
• The other environment that works really well is your customer’s  
office. It can be time consuming to do, but even 30 minutes in  
theirofficecantellyoualot.Theyaremastersoftheirdomainand  
often very talkative. In addition, all the cues are there to remind  
themofhowtheymightusetheproduct.Youcanalsolearnfrom  
seeingwhattheirofficelookslike.Howbigistheirmonitor?How  
fast is their computer and network connectivity? How do they  
communicate with their colleagues on their work tasks?  
• There are tools for doing this type of testing remotely, and I  
encourage that, but they are primarily designed for usability  
testing and not for the value testing that will usually follow. So,  
I view the remote usability testing as a supplement rather than a  
replacement.  
# Testing Your Prototype  
Nowthatyou’vegotyourprototype  
ready, lined up your test subjects,  
and prepared the tasks and ques-  
tions, here are a set of tips and  
techniques for administering the  
actual test.  
Beforeyoujumpin,wewantto  
take the opportunity to learn how  
Wewanttolearnwhether  
theuserorcustomerreally  
hastheproblemswethink  
theyhave,andhowthey  
solvethoseproblemstoday,  
andwhatitwouldtakefor  
themtoswitch.  
they think about this problem  
today. If you remember the key questions from the CustomerInterview  
Technique, we want to learn whether the user or customer really has Testing Usability **247**  
the problems we think they have, and how they solve those problems  
today, and what it would take for them to switch.  
• Whenyoufirststarttheactualusabilitytest,makesuretotellyour  
subject that this is just a prototype, it’s a very early product idea,  
andit’snotreal.Explainthatshewon’tbehurtingyourfeelingsby  
giving her candid feedback, good or bad. You’re testing the ideas  
intheprototype,you’renottestingher.Shecan’tpassorfail—only  
the prototype can pass or fail.  
• One more thing before you jump into your tasks\: See if they can  
tell from the landing page of your prototype what it is that you  
do, and especially what might be valuable or appealing to them.  
Again,oncetheyjumpintotasks,you’lllosethatfirst-timevisitor  
context, so don’t waste the opportunity. You’ll find that landing  
pages are incredibly important to bridging the gap between  
expectations and what the product does.  
• When testing, you’ll want to do everything you can to keep  
your users in use mode and out of critique mode. What matters is  
whether users can easily do the tasks they need to do. It really  
doesn’tmatteriftheuserthinkssomethingonthepageisuglyor  
should be moved or changed. Sometimes misguided testers will  
ask users questions like “What three things on the page would  
you change?” To me, unless that user happens to be a product  
designer,I’mnotreallyinterestedinthat.Ifusersknewwhatthey  
really wanted, software would be a lot easier to create. So, watch  
what they do more than what they say.  
• During the testing, the main skill you have to learn is to keep  
quiet. When we see someone struggle, most of us have a natural  
urge to help the person out. You need to suppress that urge. It’s  
yourjobtoturnintoahorribleconversationalist.Getcomfortable  
with silence—it’s your friend.  
• There are three important cases you’re looking for\: \(1\) the user  
got through the task with no problem at all and no help; \(2\) the  
userstruggledandmoanedabit,butheeventuallygotthroughit;  
or\(3\)hegotsofrustratedhegaveup.Sometimespeoplewillgive  
up quickly, so you may need to encourage them to keep trying a  
bit longer. But, if he gets to the point that you believe he would **248** INSPIRED  
truly leave the product and go to a competitor, then that’s when  
you note that he truly gave up.  
• In general, you’ll want to avoid giving any help or leading the  
witness in any way. If you see the user scrolling the page up and  
down and clearly looking for something, it’s okay to ask the user  
whatspecificallyshe’slookingfor,asthatinformationisveryvalu-  
abletoyou.Somepeopleaskuserstokeeparunningnarrationof  
whatthey’rethinking,butIfindthistendstoputpeopleincritique  
mode, as it’s not a natural behavior.  
• Act like a parrot. This helps in many ways. First, it helps avoid  
leading.Ifthey’requietandyoureallycan’tstanditbecauseyou’re  
uncomfortable, tell them what they’re doing\: “I see that you’re  
lookingatthelistontheright.”Thiswillpromptthemtotellyou  
whatthey’retryingtodo,whatthey’relookingfor,orwhateverit  
maybe.Iftheyaskaquestion,ratherthangivingaleadinganswer,  
you can play back the question to them. They ask, “Will clicking  
onthismakeanewentry?”andyouaskinreturn,“You’rewonder-  
ing if clicking on this will make a new entry?” Usually, they will  
take it from there because they’ll want to answer your question\:  
“Yeah, I think it will.” Parroting also helps avoid leading value  
judgments. If you have the urge to say, “Great!” instead you can  
say, “You created a new entry.” Finally, parroting key points also  
helps your note taker because she has more time to write down  
important things.  
• Fundamentally,you’retryingtogetanunderstandingofhowyour  
targetusersthinkaboutthisproblemandtoidentifyplacesinyour  
prototype where the model the software presents is inconsistent  
orincompatiblewithhowtheuseristhinkingabouttheproblem.  
That’s what it means to be counterintuitive. Fortunately, when  
you spot this, it is not usually hard to fix, and it can be a big win  
for your product.  
• Youwillfindthatyoucantellagreatdealfrombodylanguageand

also clear when they genuinely do. They’ll almost always ask for

# Summarizing the Learning  
The point is to gain a deeper understanding of your users and cus-  
tomersand,ofcourse,toidentifythefrictionpointsintheprototypeso  
you can fix them. It might be nomenclature, flow, visual design issues,  
or mental model issues, but as soon as you think you’ve identified an  
issue, just fix it in the prototype. There’s no law that says you have to  
keepthetestidenticalforallofyourtestsubjects.Thatkindofthinking  
stems from misunderstanding the role this type of qualitative testing  
plays. We’re not trying to prove anything here; we’re just trying to  
learn quickly.  
Aftereachtestsubject,oraftereachsetoftests,someone—usually  
either the product manager or the designer—writes up a short  
summary e-mail of key learnings  
and sends it out to the product

# Testing Value  
**C**ustomers don’t have to buy our products, and users don’t have to  
choose to use a feature. They will only do so if they perceive real  
value.Anotherwaytothinkaboutthisisthatjustbecausesomeonecan  
use our product doesn’t mean they will chooseto use our product. This  
is especially true when you are trying to get your customers or users  
to switch from whatever product or system they were using before to  
your new product. And, most of the time, our users and customers are  
switching from something—even if that something is a homegrown  
solution.  
So many companies and product teams think all they need to do  
is match the features \(referred to as featureparity\), and then they don’t  
understand why their product doesn’t sell, even at a lower price.  
Thecustomermustperceiveyourproducttobesubstantiallybetter  
tomotivatethemtobuyyourproductandthenwadethroughthepain  
and obstacles of migrating from their old solution.  
All of this is a long way of saying that good product teams spend  
most of their time on creating value. If the value is there, we can  
**251** **252** INSPIRED  
fix everything else. If it’s not, how  
good our usability, reliability, or  
performance is doesn’t matter.  
There are several elements of  
value, and there are techniques for  
testing all of them.

# Testing Demand  
Sometimes it’s unclear if there’s demand for what we want to build. In  
otherwords,ifwecouldcomeupwithanamazingsolutiontothisprob-  
lem,docustomersevencareaboutthisproblem?Enoughtobuyanew  
product and switch to it? This concept of demand testing applies to  
entire products, down to a specific feature on an existing product.  
We can’t just assume there’s demand, although often the demand  
is well established because most of the time our products are enter-  
ing an existing market with demonstrated and measurable demand.  
The real challenge in that situation is whether we can come up with  
a demonstrably better solution in terms of value than the alternatives.  
# Testing Value Qualitatively  
The most common type of qualitative value testing is focused on the  
response,orreaction.Docustomerslovethis?Willtheypayforit?Will  
users choose to use this? And most important, if not, why not?  
# Testing Value Quantitatively

# Demand Testing Techniques  
**O**neofthebiggestpossiblewastesoftimeandeffort,andthereason  
for countless failed startups, is when a team designs and builds a  
product—testingusability,testingreliability,testingperformance,and  
doing everything they think they’re supposed to do—yet, when they  
finally release the product, they find that people won’t buy it.  
Evenworse,it’snotliketheysignupforatrialinsignificantnum-  
bers, but then for some reason don’t decide to buy. We can usually  
recoverfromthat.It’sthattheydon’tevenwanttosignupforthetrial.  
That’s a tremendous and often fatal problem.  
You might experiment with pricing, positioning, and marketing,  
but you eventually conclude that this is just not a problem people are  
concerned enough about.  
The worst part of this scenario is that, in my experience, it’s so  
easily avoided.  
The problem I just described can happen at the product level,  
such as an all-new product from a startup, or at the feature level. The  
feature example is depressingly common. Every day, new features get  
deployed that don’t get used. And, this case is even easier to prevent.  
**253** **254** INSPIRED  
Suppose you were contem-  
plating a new feature, perhaps  
because a large customer is asking  
for it or maybe because you saw  
that a competitor has the feature or  
maybe it’s your CEO’s pet feature.  
Youtalkaboutthefeaturewithyour  
team, and your engineers point out  
to you that the implementation  
cost is substantial. Not impossible

theyfindthatpeople  
won’tbuyit.  
but not easy either—enough that  
you don’t want to take the time to  
build this only to find out later it wasn’t used.  
The demand-testing technique is called a fake door demand test.  
The idea is that we put the button or menu item into the user experi-  
ence exactly where we believe it should be. But, when the user clicks  
that button, rather than taking the user to the new feature, it instead  
takes the user to a special page that explains that you are studying the  
possibilityofaddingthisnewfeature,andyouareseekingcustomersto  
talktoaboutthis.Thepagealsoprovidesawayfortheusertovolunteer  
\(by providing their e-mail or phone number, for example\).  
What’s critical for this to be effective is that the users not have  
any visible indication that this is a test until after they click that  
button. The benefit is that we can quickly collect some very helpful  
data that will allow us to compare the click-through rate on this  
button with our expectations or with other features. And then we can  
follow up with customers to get a better understanding of what they  
would expect.  
The same basic concept applies to entire products. Rather than  
a button on a page, we set up the landing page for the new offering’s  
product funnel. This is called a landingpagedemandtest. We describe  
that new offering exactly as we would if we were really launching the  
service.Thedifferenceisthatiftheuserclicksthecalltoaction,rather  
than signing up for the trial \(or whatever the action might be\), the  
user sees a page that explains that you are studying the possibility of  
adding this new offering, and you’d like to talk with them about that  
new offering if they’re willing. Demand Testing Techniques **255**  
Withbothformsofdemandtesting,wecanshowthetesttoevery  
user\(inthecaseofanearlystartup\)orwecanshowittojustaverysmall  
percentage of users or within in a specific geography \(in the case of a  
larger company\).  
Hopefully, you can see that this is very easy to do, and you can  
quickly collect two very useful things\: \(1\) some good evidence on  
demand and \(2\) a list of users who are very ready and willing to talk  
with you about this specific new capability.  
Inpractice,thedemandisusuallynottheproblem.Peopledosign  
upforourtrial.Theproblemisthattheytryoutourproductandthey  
don’t get excited about it—at least not excited enough to switch from  
what they currently use. And dealing with that is the purpose of the  
qualitative and quantitative techniques in the chapters that follow.  
# Discovery Testing in Risk-Averse Companies  
Much has been written about how to do product discovery in  
startups—by me and by many others. There are many challenges for  
startups, but most important is survival.  
One of the real advantages to startups from a product point of  
view is that there’s no legacy to drag along, no revenue to preserve,  
and no reputation to safeguard. This allows us to move very quickly  
and take significant risks without much downside.  
However, once your product develops to the point that it can  
sustain a viable business \(congratulations!\), you now have something  
to lose, and it’s not surprising that some of the dynamics of prod-  
uct discovery need to change. My goal here is to highlight these  
differencesandtodescribehowthetechniquesaremodifiedinlarger,  
enterprise companies.  
Others have also been writing about how to apply these tech-  
niques in enterprises, but on the whole, I have not been particularly  
impressed with the advice I’ve seen. Too often, the suggestion is to  
carve out a protected team and provide them some air cover so they  
can go off and innovate. First of all, what does this say about the  
people not on these special innovation teams? What does this say  
\(continued\) **256** INSPIRED  
Themostimportantpoint  
fortechnologycompanies\:  
Ifyoustopinnovating,you

\(continued\)  
about the company’s existing  
products? And, even when  
something does get some trac-  
tion, how well do you think  
the existing product teams will  
accept this learning? These  
are some of the reasons I’m not an advocate of so-called corporate  
innovation labs.  
Ihavelongarguedthatthetechniquesofproductdiscoveryand  
rapid test and learn absolutely apply to large enterprise companies,  
and not just to startups. The best product companies—including  
Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix—are great examples  
wherethiskindofinnovationisinstitutionalized.Inthesecompanies,  
innovation is not something that just a few people get permission to  
pursue. It is the responsibility of allproduct teams.  
But before I go any further, I want to emphasize the most  
important point for technology companies\: If you stop innovating,  
youwilldie.Maybenotimmediately,butifallyoudoisoptimizeyour  
existingsolutions,andyoustop

else’s lunch.  
I believe it’s a non-negotiable that we simply must continue  
to move our products forward, and deliver increased value to our  
customers.  
That said, we need to do this in a responsible way. This really  
means doing two really big things—protect your revenue and brand,  
and protect your employees and customers.  
# Protect Revenue and Brand  
The company has built a reputation and has earned revenue, and it is  
thejoboftheproductteamstodoproductdiscoveryinwaysthatpro-  
tectthisreputationandthisrevenue.We’vegotmoretechniquesthan  
ever to do this, including many techniques for creating very low-cost  
\(continued\) Demand Testing Techniques **257**  
\(continued\)  
and low-risk prototypes, and for proving things work with minimal  
investment and limited exposure. We love live-data prototypes and  
A/B testing frameworks.  
Many things do not pose a risk to brand or revenue, but for the  
thingsthatdo,weutilizetechniquestomitigatethisrisk.Mostofthe  
timeanA/Btestwith1percentorlessofthecustomersexposedisfine  
for this.  
Sometimes, however, we need to be even more conservative. In  
such cases, we’ll do an invite-only live-data test, or we’ll utilize our  
customer discovery program customers that are under NDA. There  
areanynumberofothertechniquesinthesamespiritoftestandlearn  
in a responsible way.  
# Protect Employees and Customers  
In addition to protecting revenue and brand, we also need to  
protect our employees and our customers. If our customer service,  
professional services, or sales staff are blindsided by constant change,  
it makes it very hard for them to do their jobs and take good care of  
customers.  
Similarly, customers that feel like your product is a moving  
target that they have to constantly relearn won’t be happy customers  
for long.  
This is why we use gentle deployment techniques, including  
assessing customer impact. Although this may seem counterintuitive,  
continuous deployment is a very powerful gentle deployment  
technique, and when used properly along with customer impact  
assessment, it is a powerful tool for protecting our customers.  
Again, most experiments and changes are non-issues, but it is  
our responsibility to be proactive with customers and employees and  
sensitive to change.  
Don’t get me wrong. I am not arguing that innovating in  
enterprise companies is easy—it’s not. But it’s not because product  
discovery techniques are the obstacles to innovation. They are abso-  
lutely critical to consistently delivering increased value to customers.  
\(continued\) **258** INSPIRED

There are broader issues in large enterprise companies that typically  
create obstacles to innovation.  
If you are at a larger, enterprise company, know that you abso-

well beyond small optimizations. But you also must do this prod-  
uct work in ways that protect brand and revenue, and protect your

# Qualitative Value Testing  
# Techniques  
**Q**uantitative testing tells us what’s happening \(or not\), but it can’t  
tell us why, and what to do to correct the situation. That’s why  
we do qualitative testing. If users and customers are not responding  
to a product the way we had hoped, we need to figure out why that’s  
the case.  
As a reminder, qualitative testing is not about proving anything.  
That’swhatquantitativetestingisfor.Qualitativetestingisaboutrapid

**259** **260** INSPIRED  
I know this is a big claim, but I argue that qualitative testing of  
your product ideas with real users and customers is probably thesingle  
mostimportantdiscoveryactivityfor you and your product team. It is so  
important and helpful that I push product teams to do at least two or  
threequalitativevaluetestseverysingleweek. Here’s how to do it\:  
# Interview First  
We generally begin the user test with a short user interview where we  
try to make sure our user has the problems we think she has, how she  
solves these problems today, and what it would take for her to switch  
\(see Customer Interview Technique\).  
# Usability Test  
Wehavemanygoodtechniquesfortestingvaluequalitatively,butthey  
alldependontheuserfirstunderstandingwhatyourproductisandhow  
it works. This is why a value test is always preceded by a usability test.  
Duringtheusabilitytest,wetesttoseewhethertheusercanfigure  
out how to operate our product. But, even more important, after a  
usability test the user knows what your product is all about and how  
it’smeanttobeused.Onlythencanwehaveausefulconversationwith  
the user about value \(or lack thereof\).  
Preparingavaluetestthereforeincludespreparingausabilitytest.  
Idescribedhowtoprepareforandrunausabilitytestinthelastchapter,  
so for now let me again emphasize that it’s important to conduct the  
usability test beforethe value test, and to do one immediately after the  
other.  
If you try to do a value test without giving the user or customer  
the opportunity to learn how to use the product, then the value test  
becomes more like a focus group where people talk hypothetically  
about your product, and try to imagine how it might work. To be  
clear\: focus groups might be helpful for gaining market insights, but  
they are not helpful in discovering the product we need to deliver \(see  
Product Discovery Principle \#1\). Qualitative Value Testing Techniques **261**  
This testing involves at least you as product manager and your  
product designer, but I am constantly amazed at how often the magic  
happenswhenoneofyourengineersisrighttherewatchingthequali-  
tativetestingwithyou.So,it’sworthyourpushingtomakethishappen  
as much as possible.  
To test usability and value, the user needs to be able to use one  
of the prototypes we described earlier. When we’re focused on testing  
value, we usually utilize high-fidelityuserprototypes.  
High-fidelity means it feels very realistic, which turns out to be  
especially important for value testing. You can also use a live-data  
prototype or a hybrid prototype.  
# Specific Value Tests  
The main challenge in testing value when you’re sitting face to face  
with actual users and customers is that people are generally nice—and  
notwillingtotellyouwhattheyreallythink.So,allofourtestsforvalue  
are designed to make sure the person is notjustbeingnicetoyou.  
# Using Money to Demonstrate Value  
One technique I like for gauging value is to see if the user would be  
willingtopayforit,evenifyouhavenointentionofchargingthemfor  
it. We’re looking for the user to pull out his or her credit card right  
thenandthereandasktobuytheproduct\(butwedon’treallywantthe  
card information\).  
If it’s an expensive product for businesses—beyond what some-  
one would put on a credit card—you can ask people if they will sign  
a “non-binding letter of intent to buy” which is a good indicator that  
people are serious.  
# Using Reputation to Demonstrate Value  
But there are other ways a user can “pay” for a product. You can see if  
they would be willing to pay with their reputation. You can ask them  
how likely they’d be to recommend the product to their friends or **262** INSPIRED  
co-workers or boss \(typically on a scale of 0–10\). You can ask them  
to share on social media. You can ask them to enter the e-mail of their  
bossortheirfriendsforarecommendation\(eventhoughwedon’tsave  
thee-mails,it’sverymeaningfulifpeoplearewillingtoprovidethem\).  
# Using Time to Demonstrate Value

# Quantitative Value Testing  
# Techniques  
**W**hilequalitativetestingisallaboutfastlearningandbiginsights,  
quantitative techniques are all about collecting evidence.  
We will sometimes collect enough data that we have statistically  
significant results \(especially with consumer services with a lot of  
daily traffic\), and other times we’ll set the bar lower and just collect  
actual usage data that we consider useful evidence—along with other  
factors—to make an informed decision.  
This is the main purpose of the live-data prototype we discussed  
earlier.Asareminder,alive-dataprototypeisoneoftheformsofpro-  
totypecreatedinproductdiscoveryintendedtoexposecertainusecases  
to a limited group of users to collect some actual usage data.  
Wehaveafewkeywaystocollectthisdata,andthetechniquewe  
select depends on the amount of traffic we have, the amount of time  
we have, and our tolerance for risk.  
**265** **266** INSPIRED  
In a true startup environment,  
we don’t have much traffic and  
we also don’t have much time, but  
we’reusuallyfinewithrisk\(wedon’t  
have much to lose yet\).  
In a more established com-  
Whilequalitativetestingis  
allaboutfastlearningand  
biginsights,quantitative  
techniquesareallabout  
collectingevidence.  
pany, we often have a lot of traffic,  
we have some amount of time \(mostly we’re worried about manage-  
ment losing patience\), and the company is usually more averse to risk.  
# A/B Testing  
The gold standard for this type of testing is an A/B test. The reason  
weloveA/Btestsisbecausetheuserdoesn’tknowwhichversionofthe  
product she is seeing. This yields data that is very predictive, which is  
what we ideally want.  
KeepinmindthatthisisaslightlydifferenttypeofA/Btestthan  
optimizationA/Btesting. Optimization testing is where we experiment  
with different calls to action, different color treatments on a button,  
and so forth. Conceptually they are the same, but in practice there  
are some differences. Optimization testing is normally surface-level,  
low-risk changes, which we often test in a split test \(50\:50\).  
IndiscoveryA/Btesting,weusuallyhavethecurrentproductshow-  
ing to 99 percent of our users, and the live-data prototype showing  
to only 1 percent of our users or less. We monitor the A/B test more  
closely.  
# Invite-Only Testing  
If your company is more risk averse, or if you just don’t have enough  
traffic to be able to show to 1 percent—or even 10 percent—and get  
useful results anytime soon, then another effective way to collect evi-  
dence is the invite-onlytest. This is where you identifya set of usersor  
customers that you contact and invite to try the new version. You tell  
them that it is an experimental version, so they are effectively opting  
in if they choose to run it. Quantitative Value Testing Techniques **267**  
The data that this group generates is not as predictive as from a  
true, blind, A/B test. We realize that those who opt in are generally  
more early adopter types; nevertheless, we are getting a set of actual  
users doing their work with our live-data prototype, and we are  
collecting really interesting data.  
Ican’ttellyouhowoftenwethinkwehavesomethingthey’lllove,  
and then we make it available to a limited group like this and we find  
that they are just not feeling it. Unfortunately, with a quantitative test  
like this all we know for sure is that they’re not using it—we can’t  
know why. That’s when we’ll follow up with a qualitative test to try  
and quickly learn why they’re not as into it as we had hoped.  
# Customer Discovery Program  
Avariationoftheinvite-onlytestistousethemembersofthecustomer  
discovery program we discussed in the section on ideation techniques.  
These companies have already opted in to testing new versions, and  
you already have a close relationship with them so you can follow up  
with them easily.  
For products for businesses, I typically use this as my primary  
technique for collecting actual usage data. We have the customer dis-  
covery program customers getting frequent updates to the live-data  
prototype, and we compare their usage data to that of our broader  
customers.  
# The Role of Analytics  
One of the most significant changes in how we do product today is  
our use of analytics. Any capable product manager today is expected  
tobecomfortablewithdataandunderstandhowtoleverageanalytics  
to learn and improve quickly.  
I attribute this change to several factors.  
First, as the market for our products has expanded dramatically  
due to access globally—and also by way of connected devices—the  
\(continued\) **268** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
sheer volume of data has  
dramatically increased, which  
gives us interesting and sta-  
tistically significantly results  
much faster.  
Second, the tools for  
accessing and learning from  
Anycapableproduct

leverageanalyticstolearn  
andimprovequickly.  
this data have improved signif-  
icantly. Mostly,however,Iseeanincreasedawarenessoftherolethat  
data can play in helping you learn and adapt quickly.  
There are five main uses of analytics in strong product teams.  
Let’s take a close look at each of these uses\:  
# Understand User and Customer Behavior  
Whenmostpeoplethinkofanalytics,theythinkofuseranalytics.That  
is, however, but one type of analytic. The idea is to understand how  
ourusersandcustomersareusingourproducts\(remember,therecan  
be many users at a single customer—at least in the B2B context\). We  
maydothistoidentifyfeaturesthatarenotbeingused,ortoconfirm  
that features are being used as we expect, or simply to gain a better  
understanding of the difference between what people say and what  
they actually do.  
This type of analytic has been collected and used for this pur-  
posebygoodproductteamsforatleast30years.Asoliddecadebefore  
theemergenceoftheweb,desktopsandserverswereabletocallhome  
and upload behavior analytics, which were then used by the prod-  
uct team to make improvements. This to me is one of the very few  
non-negotiables in product. My view is that, if you’re going to put a  
featurein,youneedtoputinatleastthebasicusageanalyticsforthat  
feature. Otherwise, how will you know if it’s working as it needs to?  
# Measure Product Progress  
I have long been a strong advocate of using data to drive product  
teams. Rather than provide the team an old-style roadmap listing  
\(continued\) Quantitative Value Testing Techniques **269**  
\(continued\)  
someone’s best guess of what features may or may not work, I  
strongly prefer to provide the product team with a set of business  
objectives—with measurable goals—and then the team makes the  
calls as to what are the best ways to achieve those goals. It’s part of  
the larger trend in product to focus on outcome and not output.  
# Prove Whether Product Ideas Work  
Today, especially for consumer companies, we can isolate the  
contribution of new features, new versions of workflows, or new  
designs by running A/B tests and then comparing the results.  
This lets us prove which of our ideas work. We don’t have to do  
this with everything, but with things that have high risk or high  
deployment costs, or that require changes in user behavior, this can  
be a tremendously powerful tool. Even where the volume of traffic  
is such that collecting statistically significant results is difficult or  
time consuming, we can still collect actual data from our live-data  
prototypes to make decisions that are much better informed.  
# Inform Product Decisions  
In my experience, the worst thing about product in the past was its  
reliance on opinions. And, usually, the higher up in the organization  
the person was who voiced it, the more that opinion counted.  
Today, in the spirit of databeatsopinions, we have the option of  
simplyrunningatest,collectingsomedata,andthenusingthatdatato  
informourdecisions.Thedataisnoteverything,andwearenotslaves  
to it, but I find countless examples today in the best product teams  
of decisions informed by test results. I hear constantly from teams  
howoftentheyaresurprisedbythedata,andhowmindsarechanged  
by it.  
# Inspire Product Work  
WhileIampersonallyhookedoneachoftheaboverolesofanalytics,  
I must admit that my personal favorite is this last point. The data we  
\(continued\) **270** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
aggregate\(fromallsources\)canbeagoldmine.Itoftenboilsdownto  
askingtherightquestions.Butbyexploringthedata,wecanfindsome  
very powerful product opportunities. Some of the best product work  
I see going on right now was inspired by the data. Yes, we often get  
greatideasbyobservingourcustomers,andwedooftengetgreatideas  
by applying new technology. But studying the data itself can provide  
insights that lead to breakthrough product ideas.  
Largely, this is because the data often catches us off guard.  
We have a set of assumptions about how the product is used—most  
of which we are not even conscious of—and when we see the data,  
we’resurprisedthat it doesn’t track with those assumptions. It’sthese  
surprises that lead to real progress.  
It’s also important for tech product managers to have a broad  
understanding of the types of analytics that are important to your  
product. Many have too narrow of a view. Here is the core set for  
most tech products\:  
• User behavior analytics \(click paths, engagement\)  
• Business analytics \(active users, conversion rate, lifetime value,  
retention\)  
• Financial analytics \(ASP, billings, time to close\)  
• Performance \(load time, uptime\)  
• Operational costs \(storage, hosting\)  
• Go-to-market costs \(acquisition costs, cost of sales, programs\)  
• Sentiment \(NPS, customer satisfaction, surveys\)

Note that we often refer to analytics as keyperformanceindicators\(KPIs\). Quantitative Value Testing Techniques **271**  
# Flying Blind  
Remarkably, I still encounter too many product teams that either  
aren’t instrumenting their product to collect analytics, or they do it  
atsuchaminorlevelthattheydon’tknowifandhowtheirproductis  
being used.  
My own teams—and every team I can think of that I’ve ever  
worked with—have been doing this for so long now that it’s hard to  
imaginenothavingthisinformation.It’shardformetoevenremem-  
berwhatitwasliketohavenorealideahowtheproductwasused,or  
whatfeatureswerereallyhelpingthecustomer,versuswhichoneswe  
thought had to be there just to help close a sale.  
Thisiseasiesttodowithcloud-basedproductsandservices,and  
mostofususewebanalyticstools,butsometimesweusehomegrown  
tools for this too.  
Good product teams have been doing this for years. And, not  
just with cloud-based sites, but also with installed mobile or desktop  
applications—on-premise software, hardware, and devices that call  
home periodically and send the usage data back to the teams. A few  
companies are very conservative and ask permission before sending  
the data, but mostly this just happens silently.  
We should all be anonymizing and aggregating the data  
so there’s nothing personally identifiable in there. Occasionally,  
however, we see in the news that another company is in trouble for  
sending raw data in the rush to market. It seems the press thinks  
we’re tracking these data for nefarious purposes, but at least with  
the companies I know and work with, they’re simply trying to make  
the products better—more valuable and more usable. This has long  
been one of our most important tools for doing so.  
The way the overall process works is that we first ask ourselves  
what we need to know about how our products are used, then we  
\(continued\) **272** INSPIRED  
Istillencountertoomany  
productteamsthateither  
aren’tinstrumentingtheir  
producttocollectanalytics,  
\(continued\)  
instrument the product to col-  
lect this information \(the par-  
ticular techniques depend on  
the tool you’re using and what  
you want to collect\). Finally,  
we generate various forms of  
online reports to view and  
interpret these data.  
For everything new we  
ortheydoitatsuchaminor  
levelthattheydon’tknowif  
andhowtheirproductis

add, we ensure we have the  
necessary instrumentation in  
place to know immediately if it is working as we expect, and if there  
aresignificantunintendedconsequences.Frankly,withoutthatinstru-  
mentation, I wouldn’t bother to roll out the feature. How would you  
know if it was working?  
For most product managers, the first thing they do in the  
morning is to check the analytics to see what happened during the  
preceding night. They’re usually running some form of test almost  
all the time, so they’re very interested in what’s happened.  
There are of course some extreme environments where  
everything lives behind very strict firewalls, but even then, the  
products can generate periodic usage reports to be reviewed and  
approved before being forwarded \(via electronic or printed reports,  
if necessary\) back to the teams.  
I’m very big on radically simplifying products by removing  
features that don’t carry their own weight. But, without knowing  
what is being used, and how it’s being used, it’s a very painful process  
to do this when you don’t know what’s really going on. We don’t  
have the data to back up our theories or decisions, so management  
\(rightfully\) balks.  
Mypersonalviewisthatyoushouldstartfromthepositionthat  
you simply must have this data, and then work backward from there  
to figure out the best way to get it. **CHAPTER**  
# 55  
# Testing Feasibility  
**W**hen we talk about validating feasibility, the engineers are really  
trying to answer several related questions\:  
• Do we know how to build this?  
• Do we have the skills on the team to build this?  
• Do we have enough time to build this?  
• Do we need any architectural changes to build this?  
• Do we have on hand all the components we need to build this?  
• Do we understand the dependencies involved in building this?  
• Will the performance be acceptable?  
• Will it scale to the levels we need?  
• Do we have the infrastructure necessary to test and run this?  
• Can we afford the cost to provision this?  
I don’t want to scare you. With most product ideas that your  
engineers review in discovery, they will quickly consider these points  
**273** **274** INSPIRED  
and simply say “No problem.” That’s because most of our work is not  
allthatnew,andengineershaveusuallybuiltsimilarthingsmanytimes  
before.  
However,therearedefinitelyideaswherethisisnotthecase,and  
someormanyofthesequestionscanbeverydifficultfortheengineers  
to answer.  
One very common example right now is that many teams are  
evaluating machine-learning technology, considering build/buy deci-  
sions, and assessing whether the technology is suitable for the job at  
hand—and, more generally, trying to understand its potential.  
Here’s some very practical and important advice for you to con-  
sider.Holdingaweeklyplanningmeetingwhereyouthrowabunchof  
ideas at the engineers—and demand they give you some sort of esti-  
mateeitherintime,storypoints,oranyotherunitofeffort—isalmost  
certain to go badly. If you put an engineer on the spot, without time  
to investigate and consider, you are very likely to get a conservative  
answer, partly designed to make you go away.  
If, however, the engineers have been following along as the team  
has tried out these ideas with customers \(using prototypes\) and seen  
whattheissuesareandhowpeoplefeelabouttheseideas,theengineers  
haveprobablyalreadybeenconsideringtheissuesforsometime.Ifit’s  
somethingyouthinkisworthwhile,thenyouneedtogivetheengineers  
some time to investigate and consider it.  
The question isn’t, “Can you do this?” Rather, you are asking  
them to look into it and answer the question, “What’s the best way  
to do this and how long would it take?”  
The engineers will sometimes come back and say they need to  
create a feasibility prototype to answer one or more of these questions.  
If that’s the case, first consider  
whether the idea is potentially  
worth investing the necessary time  
in discovery. If so, then encourage  
the engineers to proceed.  
One last point on assessing  
feasibility\: I meet many product  
managers who hate any product  
idea that the engineers say they  
need additional time to investigate.Many of our best product  
ideas are based on  
approaches to solving the  
problem that are only now  
possible, which means new  
technology and time to  
investigate and learn that  
technology. Testing Feasibility **275**  
To these product managers, this means it is already too risky and time  
consuming if that happens.  
I tell these product managers that I personally love these items  
for a few reasons. First, many of our best product ideas are based on  
approaches to solving the problem that are only now possible, which  
means new technology and time to investigate and learn that technol-  
ogy. Second, I find that when engineers are given even a day or two  
to investigate, they often come back not only with good answers to  
the feasibility question but also with better ways to solve the problem.  
Third, these sorts of items are often very motivating to the team, as it  
gives them an opportunity to learn and to shine.  
# Discovery for Hardware Products  
With hardware, the  
consequences of a mistake in  
terms of time and money  
are much more severe.  
So many technology-powered  
products today have a hard-  
ware element within them.  
From phones to watches to  
robotics to cars to medical  
instruments to thermostats,  
smart devices are all around us.  
So how does adding hardware to the equation affect everything  
we’ve discussed thus far?  
There are some obvious differences, such as different  
engineering skill sets, the need for industrial design, and of course,  
manufacturingstilltakessubstantiallylongerthansoftware,although  
it continues to improve.  
For the most part, however, everything we have discussed thus  
farstillapplies,althoughtherearesomeadditionalchallengesaswell.  
Moreover,whenhardwareisapartoftheequation,thediscoverytech-  
niqueswe’vediscussedareevenmoreimportant,especiallytheroleof  
prototyping.  
The reason is because, with hardware, the consequences of a  
mistakeintermsoftimeandmoneyaremuchmoresevere.Withsoft-  
ware, we can usually issue corrections relatively inexpensively. With  
hardware, no such luck.  
\(continued\) **276** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
Specifically, there are more technical feasibility risks with  
hardware, and there are additional business viability risks. For  
example, with hardware we need a much more sophisticated analysis  
of parts, manufacturing costs, and forecasting. That said, the neces-  
saryprototypingofthehardwaredevicehasbeenhelpeddramatically  
with the advent of 3D printing technology.  
The bottom line is that hardware products require tackling the  
value, usability, feasibility, and viability risks aggressively and raising  
your bar on the level of confidence you have before you commit to  
manufacturing. **CHAPTER**

# Testing Business Viability  
**T**here’snoquestionthatit’shardenoughjusttryingtocomeupwith  
a product that your customers love and your engineers can build  
and deliver. Many products never get to this point.  
However, the truth is this is not enough. The solution must also  
workforyourbusiness.And I will warn you now that this is often much  
more difficult than it sounds.  
Manyproductmanagersconfesstomethatthisistheleastfavorite  
part of their job. While I understand that, I also explain to them that  
this is often what separates the good product managers from the great  
ones, and that more than anything else, this is what is really meant by  
being theCEOoftheproduct.  
Buildingabusinessisalwayshard.Youmusthaveabusinessmodel  
that’s viable. The costs to produce, market and sell your product must  
be sufficiently less than the revenue your product generates. You must  
operate within the laws of the countries you sell in. You must hold up  
your end of business agreements and partnerships. Your product must  
fit within the brand promise of your company’s other offerings.  
**277** **278** INSPIRED  
You need to help protect your  
company’s revenue, reputation,  
employees, and customers you’ve  
worked so hard to earn.  
Thisiswhatisreallymeant  
bybeingthe CEO of the  
product.  
In this chapter, I name the  
main stakeholders in a tech-powered product company, discuss their  
typicalconcernsandconstraints,andexplainhowtheproductmanager  
would test business viability with each area.  
While this is a very common list, and most or all of these areas  
probablyapplytoyourproducts,itisalsoverycommonthatanycom-  
pany will have one or more special stakeholders that are unique to  
the business. Just because it’s not listed below does not mean it’s not  
absolutely critical for you to deal with.  
The last thing you want to have happen is that your team moves  
forwardandtakesthetimetocommercializethesolutionanddelivera  
shippable product, only to find out that you can’t ship because you are  
violatingoneoftheseconstraints.Makenomistakeaboutit,whenthat  
happens, it’s on the product manager. It is your job to ensure that you  
understandeachoftherelevantconstraints,andtakepositiveactionto  
work within them.  
# Marketing  
We’ve already discussed product marketing, which we view more as a  
member of the product team than as a stakeholder. But, more gener-  
ally, marketing cares about enabling sales, they care about the brand  
and reputation of the company, and they care about market competi-  
tivenessanddifferentiation.Marketingneedstheresultingproductsto  
berelevantandcompelling,andworkwiththego-tomarketchannels.  
So, anything that you’re considering that puts those at risk will be a  
major concern.  
If what you are proposing to build could impact the sales chan-  
nel, the major marketing programs, or is potentially outside of the  
brand promise \(the range of things your customers expect from your  
company\), then you’ll want to discuss this with marketing and show  
themprototypesofwhatyouareproposingbeforeyouconsiderbuilding  
anything. Work with them to find ways to address their concerns. Testing Business Viability **279**  
# Sales  
If your company has a direct sales organization or an advertising sales  
organization, then this has a very big impact on the product organi-  
zation. Successful products typically need to be designed around the  
strengths and limitations of the sales channel.  
For example, a direct sales channel is very expensive, and this  
requires a high-value product and price point. Or, you may have built  
up a sales channel with a certain set of skills, and if your new product  
requires a very different set of skills and knowledge, your sales force  
may completely reject the product.  
Ifwhatyouareproposingwouldrepresentadeparturefromwhat  
thesaleschannelhasproventheirabilitytosell,sitdownwiththesales  
leadership and show them what you are proposing before you build  
anything, and see if together you can figure out a way to effectively  
sell this.  
# Customer Success  
Some tech companies have what’s referred to as a high-touch model  
of helping their customers, and some have a low-touch model. You  
need to understand what your company’s customer success strategy  
is, and you need to ensure that your products are aligned with  
that strategy.  
Again, if you are proposing something that would represent a  
change,you’llwanttositdownwithleadershipanddiscusstheoptions.  
As a side note, if you have a high-touch service model, these  
people are exceptionally helpful for product insights and prototype  
testing.  
# Finance  
Finance often represents several different constraints and considera-  
tions, not the least of which is whether you can afford to build, sell,  
andoperateyournewproduct.But,businessanalyticsandreportingare  
often in finance, and investor relations and other concerns may bring  
their own set of constraints. **280** INSPIRED  
If there are cost issues involved, sitting down with someone in  
finance and modeling the costs will be critical to demonstrating to  
leadership that you have worked out a viable approach.  
# Legal  
For many tech-powered companies, especially those that are working  
hard to disrupt markets, legal can play a very significant role. Privacy  
concerns, compliance concerns, intellectual property, and competitive  
issuesareallcommonconstraintsrelatedtolegal.Youcansaveyourself  
a whole lot of time and grief by sitting down early with someone from  
your legal team and discussing with them what you are proposing and  
whether they anticipate any issues or areas you should be aware of.  
# Business Development  
Mostbusinesseshavesomenumberofclosebusinessrelationshipswith  
partners of various types, usually with a contract behind each that has

ments can cripple your company’s ability to compete. Sometimes they  
are a huge win. In either case, you need to understand the impact of  
theserelationshipsonyourproductsandwhatyouareproposingtodo.  
# Security  
We would normally think of security not as a stakeholder, but more as  
anintegralpartoftheengineeringorganizationandhenceapartofthe  
product team. However, the issues involving security are so important  
for so many technology-powered companies that I think it’s useful to

Testing business viability means making sure that the product  
solution that your team is proposing will work within the constraints  
of each of these areas. For those stakeholders that are impacted, it’s  
important that they have a chance to review the proposal and ensure  
their concerns have been addressed.  
# User Test versus Product Demo versus Walkthrough  
Throughout this book, I have talked about “showing the prototype.”  
In truth, there are three very different techniques for showing the  
prototype, and you have to be careful to use the right technique for  
the right situation.  
A user test is when we test our product ideas on real users and  
customers.Itisaqualitativeusabilityandvalue-testingtechnique,and  
we let the user drive. The purpose is to testthe usability and value of  
the prototype or product.  
Aproductdemoiswhenyousellyourproducttoprospectiveusers  
and customers, or evangelize your product across your company.  
This is a sales or persuasive tool. Product marketing usually creates  
a carefully scripted product demo, but the product manager will  
occasionally be asked to give the product demo—especially with  
high-valuecustomersorexecs.Inthiscase,theproductmanagerdoes  
the driving. The purpose is to showoff the value of the prototype or  
product.

A walkthrough is when  
you show your prototype to  
a stakeholder and you want  
to make sure they see and

might be a concern. The pur-  
pose is to give the stakeholder

every opportunity to spot a  
problem. The product manager usually drives, but if the stakeholder  
would like to play with the prototype we are happy to let them. You  
arenottryingtosellthemanything,you’renottryingtotestonthem,  
and you’re definitelynot trying to hide anything from them.  
I have seen many inexperienced product managers do a walk-  
throughwithaprospectivecustomerwhentheyshouldhaveprepared  
a product demo. Or another really common rookie mistake is to do  
a product demo during a user test, and then ask the user what they  
think.  
Be sure to be clear about whether you’re doing a user test, a  
product demo, or a walkthrough. And, be sure you’re skilled in how  
to do all three. **CHAPTER**

**N**etflix is one of my all-time favorite products and companies.

300,000 customers.  
They were essentially providing the same general pay-per-rental

were, as always, some early adopters, and some people lived in places

didn’t seem very willing to change. The team knew that the service  
wasn’t better enough to get people to change.  
**283** **284** INSPIRED  
Even worse, DVD sales were  
starting to lag, and a Hollywood  
backlash further muddied the situ-  
ation. Then there were challenges

Those were the

in a way that covered costs and generated some cash.  
KateArnoldwastheproductmanagerforthissmallteam,andthe  
team knew they needed to do something different.  
Oneofmanyteststheytriedwastomovetoasubscriptionservice.  
The idea was to get people to sign up for a month, and offer them  
unlimited movies. Would that be perceived as better enough to get  
them to change their media consumption behavior?  
Thegood news wasthat,yes,thisapproachreallydidappealtopeo-  
ple. A flat monthly fee and all the videos they could consume sounded  
pretty great.  
The bad news is that the team created some real problems for  
themselves. No surprise that Netflix customers wanted to rent mostly  
newly released feature films; yet, these were much more expensive for  
Netflix to stock, andthey would needto stockso manycopiesof these  
that they’d very likely run out of money fast.  
So, the product challenge became how they were going to make  
sureNetflixcustomerscouldwatchasetofmoviestheywouldlove,yet  
wouldn’t bankrupt the company.  
They knew they needed to somehow get customers to want  
and ask for a blend of expensive and less expensive titles. Necessity  
being the mother of invention, this is where Netflix’s queue, ratings  
system, and recommendation engine all came from. Those were the  
technology-powered innovations that enabled the new, much more  
desirable business model.  
So, the team got to work. In three months’ time, the team  
redesigned the site—introducing the queue, the rating system, and  
therecommendationsengineallinsupportofNetflixasasubscription

They also rewrote the billing system to handle the monthly sub-

But I would argue that without Kate driving for the technology-based  
solutions that could power this business, there’s a good chance Netflix

One more interesting little aside about early Netflix—when they

Blockbuster for \$50 million, and Blockbuster turned them down.

# Transformation Techniques  
# Overview  
So far, we’ve been discussing techniques for discovering successful  
products.Butit’simportanttoacknowledgethatgettingproductteams  
and companies to apply the new techniques and work differently is  
often easier said than done.  
Partly this is because people are people. But mainly it’s hard  
because the changes are so often cultural.  
Asaveryexplicitexample,movingfrommercenary-style,product  
roadmap-driven, output-focused teams, to truly empowered, account-  
able product teams that are measured by business results, represents  
a major cultural shift and a substantial handoff of power and control  
from management to the individuals on the teams.  
Believe me, this is not the type of change that happens easily.  
Fortunately, there are techniques that can help the organization  
through this. **CHAPTER**

# Discovery Sprint Technique  
**I**findthatmanyteams,especiallythosenewtomodernproducttech-  
niques,arelookingforastructuredintroductiontomodernproduct  
discovery. In this chapter, I describe the concept of a discovery sprint.  
A discovery sprint is a one-week time box of product discovery  
work, designed to tackle a substantial problem or risk your product  
team is facing.  
A discovery sprint is definitely useful for more than just trans-  
formation. It could just as easily be considered a discovery planning  
technique or a discovery prototyping technique. But I find it’s most  
helpful in bringing all these things together, so I choose to include  
it here.  
Somepeopleusethetermdesign sprint ratherthandiscovery sprint,  
but as the purpose of the work—when done well—goes significantly  
beyond design, I prefer the more general term.  
Further,ifyourcompanyhasbeenstrugglingwiththeconceptof  
MVP, this is a very good way to start getting the value from this key  
technique.  
**287** A discovery sprint is a  
one-week time box of  
product discovery work,  
designed to tackle a  
substantial problem or risk  
your product team is facing.  
**288** INSPIRED  
I first met the Google  
Ventures \(GV\) team many years  
ago when they were just getting  
started. They are part of Google’s  
investment arm, but even more  
valuable to the startup than their  
money, GV created a small team to  
go in and help the companies they  
invest in get their product efforts  
off to a good start. Their model is to typically spend a week with the  
startup—rollinguptheirsleevesandshowingthemhowtodoproduct  
discovery by doing it with them side by side.  
I also know several other proven product people, known as dis-  
covery coaches, who do essentially the same thing for the teams they are  
helping.  
In any case, during this week of intense discovery work, you and  
your team will likely explore dozens of different product ideas and  
approaches,withthegoalofsolvingsomesignificantbusinessproblem.  
You’ll always end your week by validating your potential solution with  
real users and customers. And, in my experience, the result is consis-  
tently big learning and insights—the kind of learning that can change  
the course of your product or your company.  
Withinthisgeneralframework,discoverycoachesadvocateavari-  
ety of different methods to help the team though the process and get  
big learning in just five days.  
After working with more than 100 product teams, and refining  
their methods as they learned what worked well and what didn’t, the  
GVteamdecidedtosharetheirlearningsinabook.Thebookistitled,  
Sprint\: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days,by  
Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz.  
The authors lay out a five-day week that starts with framing the  
problem by mapping the problem space, picking the problem to be  
solved and the target customer, and then progresses into pursuing  
several different approaches to the solution. The team next narrows  
down and fleshes out the different potential solutions, then creates a  
high-fidelity user prototype—finally, putting that prototype in front  
of actual target users and observing their reactions.  
And, yes, you can absolutely do this all in a week. Discovery Sprint Technique **289**  
Sprint spells out the authors’ favorite techniques to accomplish  
each of these steps, and if you’ve read this far, you’ll recognize all  
of them. But what I like so much about the GV book is that, when  
teams are getting started, they often crave the structure of a proven,  
step-by-step recipe. The book spells out exactly this over nearly 300  
pages, with dozens of examples from great products and teams you’ll  
recognize.  
There are several situations where I recommend a discovery  
sprint, starting with when the team has something big and critically  
important and/or difficult to tackle. Another situation where a discov-  
ery sprint helps is when the team is just learning how to do product  
discovery. And yet another is when things are just moving too slow  
and the team needs to recalibrate on just how fast they can and should  
be moving.  
Sprint is another must read book for product managers, and I  
highly recommend it.  
# Discovery Coaches  
Discovery coaches are  
typically former product  
managers or product  
As teams moved to Agile  
methods \(they usually start  
with Scrum\), many companies  
decidedtocontractwithorhire  
an Agile coach. These coaches  
help the broader team—  
especially engineers, QA,  
designers and they have  
usually worked for, or with,  
leading product companies.  
product managers, and prod-  
uct designers—learn the methods and mindset involved in moving  
to Agile.  
This sounds straightforward enough, but many problems arise  
because the vast majority of these Agile coaches don’t have experi-  
ence with tech-product companies, so their experience is limited to  
delivery. Therefore, they would more accurately be considered Agile  
delivery coaches. They understand the engineering and release side  
of things, but not the discovery side of things.  
\(continued\) **290** INSPIRED  
\(continued\)  
So many product companies have experienced this issue that  
it created the need for coaches that do have deep experience with  
product companies and the key product roles, especially product  
management and product design. These individuals are often called  
discovery coaches.  
Discovery coaches are typically former product managers or  
product designers \(or former leaders of these areas\) and they have  
usually worked for, or with, leading product companies. So, they  
are able to work side by side with actual product managers and  
designers—not just reciting Agile platitudes, but showing the team  
how to work effectively.  
Every discovery coach has his or her preferred way of engaging  
withateam,buttheyareusuallyengagedwithoneorasmallnumber  
of product teams for a week or so. During this time, they help you  
throughoneormorediscoverycyclesofideation;creatingprototypes;  
andvalidatingtheprototypeswithcustomerstogaugetheirreactions,  
with engineers to evaluate feasibility, and with business stakeholders  
to assess whether this solution would work for your business.  
It’s hard for me to imagine an effective discovery coach who  
doesn’t have first-hand experience as a product manager or product  
designer at a modern product company. That’s likely one of the  
main reasons there’s a shortage of discovery coaches today. It’s also  
important that the discovery coach understand how to include engi-  
neering in the mix—being sensitive to their time, but understanding  
the essential role they play in innovation.  
Discovery coaches are not unlike Lean Startup coaches. The  
main difference is that Lean Startup coaches often focus on help-  
ing a team discover not only their product, but also their business  
model,andtheirsalesandmarketingstrategy.Oncethenewbusiness  
has some traction, the discovery is usually more about continuously  
improving an existing product in substantial ways rather than creat-  
inganall-newbusiness.Becauseofthisdifference,manyLeanStartup  
coaches don’t have the necessary product experience. My view is that

so I believe an effective Lean Startup coach must also be very strong  
at product. **CHAPTER**

# Pilot Team Technique  
**E**arlier in this book, we discussed the technology adoption curve  
and how this theory describes how different people will accept  
change.Itturnsoutthistheoryalsoappliestoourownorganizationand  
especially to how we make changes to how that organization works.  
Some people in your organization love change, some want to see  
someone else use it successfully first, some need more time to digest  
changes, and a few hate change and will only change if they’re forced  
to do it.  
Ifyougettooexcitedandrolloutasignificantchangetoeveryone  
in the organization at once, then the laggards \(those that hate change\)  
may resist or even sabotage your efforts.  
Rather than fight this reality, we can embrace it. One of the sim-  
plest techniques for facilitating moving to new ways of working is the  
use of pilot teams. Pilotteamsallow the roll out of change to a limited  
partoftheorganizationbeforeimplementingitmorebroadly.Theidea

Yourspecificsuccessmeasures

the team’s effectiveness in deliver-

well do the pilot teams accomplish  
their objectives versus the others  
or compared to how they did in  
the past?  
Giventhenatureoftheexper-

# Off Roadmaps  
**M**anyproductteamswanttomoveoffproductroadmaps,buttheir  
organizationsareoldschool,addictedtotheoutdatedquarterly  
product roadmap. As a result, they don’t see how to transition their  
organizations forward.  
Here’s what I advocate in this case\: Plan to continue with your  
existing roadmap process for six to 12 months. However, starting  
immediately, every time you reference a product roadmap item, or  
discuss it in a presentation or meeting, be sure to include a reminder  
of the actual businessoutcomethat feature is intended to help.  
If the feature you’re working  
on is to add PayPal as a payment  
method, and the reason is to

Thegoalisthatovertime\(itcantakeaslongasayear\),theorga-  
nization moves its focus from specific features launching on specific  
dates to business results.  
For this to work, it’s important to acknowledge the two big  
reasons why stakeholders especially are so attracted to roadmaps\:  
1\. They want some visibility into what you are working on and  
assurance that you are working on the most important items.  
2\. Theywanttobeabletoplanthebusinessandneedtoknowwhen  
critical things will happen.  
The modern alternative to roadmaps discussed here addresses  
both of these concerns. Teams work on the prioritized business objec-  
tivesdeterminedbytheleaders;weshareourkeyresultstransparently;  
and we commit to high-integrity commitments when critical delivery  
dates are needed. Process @ Scale **295**

# Product Manager Responsibilities  
In terms of the stakeholders, the product manager has the responsi-  
bility to understand the considerations and constraints of the various  
stakeholders, and to bring this knowledge into the product team. It  
doesn’tdoanyoneanygoodtobuildthingsthatmayworkforthecus-

realize, and every time it does hap-  
pen,thecompanylosesalittlemore  
confidence in the product team.  
However,beyondunderstand-  
ing the constraints and concerns  
of each stakeholder, if you want  
the latitude to come up with the  
most-effective solutions, then it’s  
The product manager has  
the responsibility to  
understand the considera-  
tions and constraints of the  
various stakeholders, and to  
bring this knowledge into  
the product team.  
critically important that the prod-  
uct manager convince each of these  
stakeholders that she not only understands the issues, but that she is  
committed to coming up with solutions that not only work for the  
customer, but also work for the stakeholder as well. And this must be  
sincere. I emphasize this because, if the stakeholder does not have this  
trust that you are going to solve for their concerns as well, then they  
will either escalate, or they will try to control.  
# Strategies for Success  
Success in terms of stakeholder management means that your  
stakeholders respect you and your contribution. They trust that you  
understand their concerns and will ensure solutions work well for  
them too. They trust that you will keep them informed of important  
decisionsorchanges.And,mostofall,theygiveyoutheroomtocome  
up with the best solutions possible, even when those solutions end up  
beingquitedifferentfromwhattheymighthaveoriginallyenvisioned.  
It’s not that difficult to have this kind of relationship with stake-  
holders,butitdoesrequirefirstandforemostthatyouareacompetent  
product manager. This especially means having a deep understanding  
of your customers, the analytics, the technology, your industry, and in  
particular, your business.  
Withoutthis,theywon’ttrustyou\(andinfairnesstheyshouldn’t\).  
The main way we demonstrate this knowledge to the organization is  
by sharing very openly what we learn. **300** INSPIRED  
With this as a foundation, the key technique is to spend  
one-on-one time with the key stakeholders. Sit down with them  
and listen. Explain that the better you understand their constraints,  
the better your solutions will be. Ask lots of questions. Be open and  
transparent.  
One of the most common mistakes product managers make with  
stakeholders is that they show them their solution after they have  
already built it. And, sometimes, there are issues because the product  
managerdidnothaveaclearenoughunderstandingoftheconstraints.  
Notonlywillthestakeholderbefrustrated,butyourengineeringteam  
willbefrustratedaswellwithalltherework.So,committopreviewing  
your solutions during discovery with the key stakeholders before you  
put this work on the product backlog.  
Thisisoneofthekeysofproductdiscovery.Indiscovery,youare  
not only making sure that your solutions are valuable and usable \(with  
customers\),andfeasible\(withengineers\),butyouarealsomakingsure  
your stakeholders will support the proposed solution.  
The other big mistake I often see being made is when situations  
boil down to the product manager’s opinion versus the stakeholder’s  
opinion. In this case, the stakeholder usually wins because he or she  
isusuallymoresenior.However,aswe’vealreadydiscussedmanytimes  
before, the key is to change the game by quickly running a test and  
collecting some evidence. Move the discussion from opinions to data.  
Share what you’re learning very openly. It may be that neither of your  
opinions were right. Again, the discovery work is designed specifically  
as a place for these tests.  
Mostly this is about creating a collaborative, mutually respect-  
ful personal relationship. For most companies, it takes about two to  
three hours a week—meeting for half an hour or so with each key  
stakeholder—tokeepthemapprised,andtogettheirfeedbackonnew  
ideas. My favorite way to do this is a weekly lunch or coffee with your  
most-involved stakeholders.  
Manyproductmanagerstellmethatthewaytheydealwithtesting  
business viability with all their different stakeholders is by scheduling  
a large, group meeting and inviting all the stakeholders. The product  
managerthenpresentstothemwhattheywanttobuild,usuallywitha

# Devolving from Good to Bad

Thereislittlequestionthatmostorganizationsbecomeworsein

There’s an anti-pattern I see in many companies that are doing  
very well, growing aggressively, yet they will sometimes—over time  
and unintentionally—replace their good behaviors with bad ones.  
I have never seen this anti-pattern written about before, and I  
suspectit’sgoingtomakemorethanafewpeopleuncomfortable.But  
it’s a serious issue that I think needs to be out in the open, as it’s not  
hard to prevent if you’re aware.  
The scenario is that you are probably a later-stage startup or  
growth-stagecompany.You’veprobablyachievedproduct/marketfit,  
at least for an initial product, and to have accomplished that, you’ve  
probably done some important things right. But then you get some  
substantial funding, or a board member strongly suggests that you  
needtobringonsome“adultsupervision”orsomeexperiencedpeople  
from brand-name companies.  
Here’sthething.Thenewpeopleyouhireareoftenfromthose

Would you rather hire all your staff and leaders from Google,  
Facebook,Amazon,andNetflix?Sureyouwould,butthesepeopleare  
in very short supply and there  
is lots of strong talent at other  
companies.  
But, let’s say you are  
at a young, growth-stage  
company, and you decide to  
hire a senior leader—maybe  
the head of product, or the  
head of engineering, or the  
head of marketing—from a  
brand name like Oracle. Your  
There is little question that  
most organizations become  
worse in their ability to  
rapidly deliver consistent  
innovation as they grow, yet

of scale.

The issue is that, unless you make this clear at the outset, that new  
leadermayassumeyou’rehiringthemfortheirknowledgeofprocess  
andhowtodefineanddeliverproducts.And,sotheybringwiththem  
their views on how things should work. Even worse, they often then  
proceed to hire people that want to work in those ways.  
Note that I’m picking on Oracle here as an example, but they  
are certainly not the only one. There are a great many very strong  
people to hire from Oracle as they love to acquire companies, often  
very good companies, but those strong product, design, and technol-  
ogy people they also acquired rarely like Oracle’s culture or ways of  
creating product.  
I have seen this anti-pattern play out at every level of a  
company—from individual engineers all the way to CEO. It doesn’t  
happen overnight; it happens over years. But I’ve seen it enough to  
be convinced it’s an anti-pattern. Many people intuitively sense this  
problem but they usually just attribute it to a “big company person,”

In my experience, people are really good about this when you  
talk openly and honestly about it. In fact, people often tell me it’s a  
major reason why they want to leave their former company. It’s more  
about getting this to be something you and they are very aware of. **CHAPTER**

# Communicating Product  
# Learnings  
**S**haring what we learn in a startup happens naturally because the  
product team and the company are pretty much the same thing.  
However,ascompaniesscale,thisbecomessubstantiallymoredifficult;  
yet, it also becomes increasingly important to do.  
A technique I love for helping with this is for the head of prod-  
uct, at a company all-hands or similar meeting every week or two, to  
take 15 to 30 minutes to highlight what has been learned in product  
discovery across the various product teams.  
Note that this is meant to cover the bigger learnings and not the  
minorthings—whatworked,whatdidn’twork,andwhattheteamsare  
planning to try the following week.

want to see. It’s not meant to be a repeat of sprint reviews either.

Instead, the update is meant to address several purposes, some  
tactical and some cultural\:

• This technique encourages the product teams to keep their focus  
on big learnings and not on minor experimentation that doesn’t  
have a real customer or business impact one way or the other.  
• Culturally, it’s critical that the organization understand that dis-  
covery and innovation is about continuously running these rapid  
experiments and learning from the results.  
• It is also important culturally that the product organization be  
transparent and generous in what they learn and how they work.  
It helps the broader organization to understand that the prod-  
uct organization is not there “to serve the business” but, rather,  
to solve problems for our customers in ways that work for our  
business. **CHAPTER**

# Profile\: Camille Hearst of  
# Apple  
**I**’d love to introduce you to another very strong product manager,  
Camille Hearst.  
Camille was a product manager on the iTunes team at Apple,  
and as you might imagine with such a disruptive and groundbreaking  
product, she experienced and learned a great deal during her forma-  
tive product years at Apple. This was especially the case because she  
was there during the years moving from iTunes’s original DRM-based  
musictoDRM-free,whichwascriticalinhelpingiTunesbecometruly  
mass market.  
Moving beyond early adopters into mass market involved many  
different efforts, some product, some marketing, and some a blend of  
the two. A good example of this blend was the relationship the iTunes  
team engaged with the AmericanIdoltelevision program.  
This turned out to be one of the most dramatic and visible—yet  
challenging—product efforts for the iTunes team.  
**307** **308** INSPIRED  
During 2008, American Idol  
was a cultural icon—watched by

integral part of consumers’ lives.  
However,whilethepotentialwassubstantial,thechallengeswere  
significant as well.  
TheVPofiTunes,EddyCue,andothersmadethebusinessdeal,  
but Camille worked as product manager on many of the integrations  
to help figure this out.  
As just one example, the American Idol program is all about  
voting, and Apple quickly realized that sales of contestants’ music  
would very likely be strongly indicative of voting results. So, while  
normally iTunes was designed to show trending music and highlight  
popular titles, in this case, it was important to use extreme care notto  
influence the voting.  
This was obviously critically important to the Idol producers—it  
wouldreduceoreveneliminatethesuspensetolearnwhichcontestants  
would continue to the next week.  
The integration also allowed the team to target a very specific  
persona and work to drive up engagement with this group. One of the  
keys was to make it easy to get to iTunes for those that didn’t yet have  
the app installed.  
Bytacklingtheseandcountlessotherchallengeshead-on,Camille  
and her team came up with technology solutions that complemented  
the AmericanIdol experience, yet also injected iTunes as a key compo-  
nent of fans’ lives. This contributed to what was in 2014, before the  
move to streaming, a roughly \$20billionbusiness.  
To me, this is a great example of how great product managers  
work to find creative solutions to very difficult problems.

Good teams have a  
compelling product vision  
that they pursue with a  
missionary-like passion.  
Bad teams are mercenaries.  
Product Manager/Bad Product  
Manager,” for those that have not yet had the opportunity to partic-  
ipate in or observe a strong product team up close, in this chapter I  
provide you with a glimpse into some of the important differences  
between strong product teams and weak teams\:  
• Good teams have a compelling product vision that they pursue  
with a missionary-like passion. Bad teams are mercenaries.  
• Good teams get their inspiration and product ideas from their  
vision and objectives, from observing customers’ struggle, from  
analyzing the data customers generate from using their product,  
and from constantly seeking to apply new technology to solve  
realproblems.Badteamsgatherrequirementsfromsalesandcus-  
tomers.  
• Good teams understand who each of their key stakeholders are,  
theyunderstandtheconstraintsthatthesestakeholdersoperatein,  
and they are committed to inventing solutions that work not just  
for users and customers, but also work within the constraints of  
the business. Bad teams gather requirements from stakeholders.  
• Good teams are skilled in the many techniques to rapidly try out  
product ideas to determine which ones are truly worth building.  
Bad teams hold meetings to generate prioritized roadmaps.  
• Good teams love to have brainstorming discussions with smart  
thoughtleadersfromacrossthecompany.Badteamsgetoffended  
when someone outside their team dares to suggest they do  
something.  
• Goodteamshaveproduct,design,andengineeringsitsidebyside,  
andtheyembracethegiveandtakebetweenthefunctionality,the  
user experience, and the enabling technology. Bad teams sit in  
their respective silos, and ask that others make requests for their  
services in the form of documents and scheduling meetings. Good Product Team/Bad Product Team **313**  
• Good teams are constantly trying out new ideas to innovate, but  
doing so in ways that protect the revenue and protect the brand.  
Bad teams are still waiting for permission to run a test.  
• Good teams insist they have the skill sets on their team, such as  
strongproductdesign,necessarytocreatewinningproducts.Bad  
teams don’t even know what product designers are.  
• Good teams ensure that their engineers have time to try out the  
prototypesindiscoveryeverydaysothattheycancontributetheir  
thoughtsonhowtomaketheproductbetter.Badteamsshowthe  
prototypes to the engineers during sprint planning so they can  
estimate.  
• Good teams engage directly with end users and customers every  
week, to better understand their customers, and to see the cus-  
tomer’s response to their latest ideas. Bad teams think they are  
the customer.  
• Good teams know that many of their favorite ideas won’t end up  
workingforcustomers,andeventheonesthatcouldwillneedsev-  
eral iterations to get to the point where they provide the desired  
outcome. Bad teams just build what’s on the roadmap, and are  
satisfied with meeting dates and ensuring quality.  
• Good teams understand the need for speed and how rapid iter-  
ation is the key to innovation, and they understand this speed  
comes from the right techniques and not forced labor. Bad teams  
complain they are slow because their colleagues are not working  
hard enough.  
• Goodteamsmakehigh-integritycommitmentsafterthey’veeval-  
uated the request and ensured they have a viable solution that  
will work for the customer and the business. Bad teams complain  
about being a sales-driven company.  
• Good teams instrument their work so they can immediately  
understand how their product is being used and make adjust-  
ments based on the data. Bad teams consider analytics and  
reporting a nice to have.  
• Good teams integrate and release continuously, knowing that a  
constant stream of smaller releases provides a much more sta-  
ble solution for their customers. Bad teams test manually at the **314** INSPIRED  
end of a painful integration phase and then release everything  
at once.  
• Good teams obsess over their reference customers. Bad teams  
obsess over their competitors.  
• Good teams celebrate when they achieve a significant impact to  
thebusinessresults.Badteamscelebratewhentheyfinallyrelease  
something.  
If a significant number of these items strike too close to home, I  
hope you’ll consider raising the bar for your team. See if you can’t use  
the techniques in this book to experience the difference. **CHAPTER**

# Top Reasons for Loss  
# of Innovation  
**I**define consistentinnovationas the ability of a team to repeatedly add  
value to the business. Many organizations lose their ability to inno-  
vate at scale, and this is incredibly frustrating to both leaders and the  
membersoftheproductteams.It’soneofthemainreasonspeopleoften  
leave large companies for startups.  
But losing the ability to innovate is absolutely and demonstrably  
not inevitable. Some of the most consistently innovative companies in  
ourindustryareverylarge—considerAmazon,Google,Facebook,and  
Netflix as examples.  
Organizations that lose the ability to innovate at scale are  
inevitably missing one or more of the following attributes\:  
1\. Customer-centric culture. AsJeffBezos,theCEOofAmazon  
says,“Customersarealwaysbeautifully,wonderfullydissatisfied,  
even when they report being happy and business is great. Even  
when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better,  
**315** **316** INSPIRED  
and your desire to delight  
customers will drive you  
to invent on their behalf.”  
Companies that don’t have  
thisfocusoncustomers—and  
direct and frequent contact  
with them—lose this pas-  
sion and critical source of  
inspiration.  
2\. Compelling product vision.  
By the time many companies  
reach scale, their original  
product vision is now largely  
“Customersarealways  
beautifully,wonderfully  
dissatisfied,evenwhenthey  
reportbeinghappyand  
businessisgreat.Even  
whentheydon’tyetknowit,  
customerswantsomething  
better,andyourdesireto

youtoinventontheir  
behalf.”  
realized, and the team is  
strugglingtounderstandwhat’snext.Thisisoftencompounded  
because the original founders may have moved on, and they  
were likely the keepers of the vision. In this case, someone  
else—usuallyeitherthe CEO or the VP product—needs to step  
up and fill this void.  
3\. Focused product strategy. One of the surest paths to product  
failure is to try to please everyone at once. Yet large compa-  
niesoftenforgetthisreality.Theproductstrategyneedstospell  
out a logical and intentional sequence of target markets for the  
product teams to focus on.  
4\. Strong product managers. The lack of a strong and capable  
product manager is typically a major reason for lack of prod-  
uct innovation. When a company is small, the CEO or one of  
theco-foundersusuallyplaysthisrole,butatscale,eachproduct  
team depends on a strong and capable product manager.  
5\. Stable product teams. One of the prerequisites for consistent  
innovation is a team that has had a chance to learn the space,  
technologies, and customer pain. This doesn’t happen if the  
members of the team are constantly shifting.  
6\. Engineers in discovery. So often the key to innovation is the  
engineers on the team, but this means \(a\) including them from  
theverybeginning,andnotjustattheendand\(b\)exposingthem  
directly to the customer pain. Top Reasons for Loss of Innovation **317**  
7\. Corporate courage. It’snosecretthatmanycompaniesbecome  
extremely risk averse as they grow larger. There is, of course,  
muchmoretolose.Butthebesttechnology-productcompanies  
know that the riskiest strategy of all is to stop taking risks. We  
do have to be smart about how we work, but the willingness to  
risk disruption to our current business is essential to consistent  
innovation.  
8\. Empowered product teams. Even though your organization  
might have begun by using best practices, many organizations  
regress as they scale, and if you’ve reverted to just handing your  
teams roadmaps of features, then you no longer can expect the  
benefits of empowered product teams. Remember that empow-  
ermentmeanstheteamsareabletotackleandsolvethebusiness  
problems they’ve been assigned in the best way they see fit.  
9\. Product mindset. In an IT-mindset organization, the product  
teams exist to serve the needs of the business. In contrast, in  
a product-mind set organization, the product teams exist to  
serve the company’s customers in ways that meet the needs of  
the business. The resulting differences between these mind sets  
are many and profound.  
10\. Time to innovate. At scale, it’s very possible that your product  
teamsareentirelyconsumedjustdoingwhatwecallkeepthelights  
onactivities.Fixingbugs,implementingcapabilitiesfordifferent  
partsofthebusiness,addressingtechnicaldebt,andmore.Ifthis  
is your situation, you shouldn’t be surprised at the lack of inno-  
vation.Someofthisisnormalandhealthy,butbesurethatyour  
teams have the room to also pursue harder and more impactful  
problems.  
Ihopeyounoticethattheabovelistessentiallydescribesaculture  
of consistent innovation. It’s much more about culture than it is about  
process—or anything else. **CHAPTER**

# Top Reasons for Loss  
# of Velocity  
**A**s organizations grow, it’s not unusual for things to slow down.  
Theydon’tneedto,andinthebestorganizations,theycanaccel-  
erate. But if you are seeing a slowdown, these are the first things to  
look for.  
1\. Technical debt. Often, the architecture does not facilitate or  
enabletherapidevolutionoftheproduct.Thisisnotsomething  
that can be fixed overnight, but it needs to be attacked in an  
ongoing and concerted effort.  
2\. Lack of strong product managers. The lack of a strong and  
capable product manager is typically a major reason for slow  
product. The impact of a weak product manager shows up in  
manyways,butitshowsupveryvisiblyasateamofmercenaries  
ratherthanmissionaries.Theproductmanagerhasnotinspired  
or evangelized to the team, or the team has lost confidence in

**319** **320** INSPIRED  
3\. Lack of delivery manage-  
ment. The most important  
function of the delivery  
manager is to remove impedi-  
ments, and the list of impedi-

capable product manager is

ments grows non-linearly  
as the technology organization grows. Most impediments won’t  
go away quickly without someone actively chasing them down.  
4\. Infrequent release cycles. Most teams with slow velocity  
have release vehicles that are too infrequent. Your team should  
releasenolessfrequentlythaneverytwoweeks\(verygoodteams  
release multiple times per day\). Correcting this typically means  
gettingseriousabouttestautomationandreleaseautomationso  
the team can move quickly and release with confidence.  
5\. Lack of product vision and strategy. It’sessentialthattheteam  
have a clear vision of the big picture and how their immediate  
work contributes to the whole.  
6\. Lack of co-located, durable product teams. If teams are split  
acrosslocations—orworse,ifengineersareoutsourced—besides  
the dramatic decrease in innovation, the velocity of the orga-  
nization will suffer significantly. Even simple communication  
becomes difficult. It gets so bad that many outsourcing firms  
willaddanotherlayerofpeopletocoordinateandcommunicate,  
which usually makes things worse.  
7\. Not including engineers early enough during product  
discovery. The engineers need to participate in product dis-  
covery from the start of ideation. They will often contribute  
alternative approaches that can be significantly faster to imple-  
ment if you include them early enough in the process for the  
product manager and designer to adjust. If not, their critical  
input will come too late in the process.  
8\. Not utilizing product design in discovery and instead having  
them try to do their work at the same time the engineers are  
trying to build. Not doing this will both slow things down and  
lead to poor designs. Top Reasons for Loss of Velocity **321**  
9\. Changing priorities. Realize that rapidly shifting priorities  
cause significant churn and substantially reduces the total  
throughput and morale.  
10\. A consensus culture. Manyorganizationsstriveforconsensus.  
While this typically comes from good intentions, what this  
means in practice is decisions are very hard to make and  
everything slows to a crawl.

need for \(and power of\) commitments, but they also insist on  
high-integrity commitments.  
• Culture of empowerment—teams feel as though they have the  
tools, resources, and permission to do whatever is necessary to  
meet their commitments. Establishing a Strong Product Culture **325**  
• Culture of accountability—people and teams feel a deep respon-  
sibility to meet their commitments. Accountability also implies  
consequences—not necessarily being terminated, except in  
extremeandrepeatedsituations,butmorelikelyconsequencesto  
their reputations among their peers.  
• Culture of collaboration—while team autonomy and empow-  
erment is important, teams understand their even higher need  
to work together to accomplish many of the biggest and most  
meaningful objectives.  
• Culture of results—is the focus on output or is the focus on  
results?  
• Culture of recognition—teams often take their cues from what is  
rewarded and what is accepted. Is it just the team that comes up  
withthegreatnewideathatgetsrewarded,ortheteamthatdeliv-  
ered on a brutally tough commitment? And what is the message  
if missing a commitment is seen as easily excusable?  
So,ifthesecharacteristicshelpdefineeachculture,thisbegssome  
pretty tough questions\:  
• Is an innovation culture in any way inherently at odds with an  
execution culture?  
• Doesastrongexecutioncultureleadtoastressful\(orworse\)work  
environment?  
• What types of people, including leaders, are attracted to, and  
needed, for each type of culture?  
I can tell you that there do exist companies that are very strong  
at both consistent innovation and execution. Amazon is one of the  
best examples. However, it’s also well known that the Amazon work  
environment is not for the faint of heart. I’ve found that most compa-  
nies that are exceptionally strong at execution are pretty tough places  
to work.  
Inmyexperienceworkingwithcompanies,onlyafewcompanies  
are strong at both innovation and execution. Many are good at execu-  
tionbutweakatinnovation;somearestrongatinnovationandjustokay **326** INSPIRED  
at execution; and a depressing number of companies are poor at both  
innovationandexecution\(usuallyoldercompaniesthatlosttheirprod-  
uct mojo a long time ago, but still have a strong brand and customer  
base to lean on\).  
In any case, what I hope you and your team will consider doing  
is assess yourself along these dimensions of innovation and execution,  
andthen askyourselveswhereyouwouldliketobe, orthinkyouneed  
to be, as a team or company. Acknowledgments  
**T**he very nature of putting together this book on sharing best prac-  
ticesfromtheindustry’sbestproductcompaniesmeansthatIhave  
learned from a great many exceptional people. I have been especially  
fortunate to have had the chance to work with and for some of our  
industry’sbestproductmindsandcompanies.Ihavelearnedfromeach  
one of these people, but some of them have made such a deep impres-  
sion on me that I must thank them here.  
First and foremost, my partners at the Silicon Valley Product  
Group. They are my colleagues now precisely because I have been so  
impressed with their talents and have learned so much from each of  
them over the years\: Lea Hickman, Martina Lauchengco, and Chris  
Jones.  
I must also thank Peter Economy, Jeff Patton, and Richard  
Narramore for their help reviewing and improving this book.  
The genesis of this book was material developed at Netscape  
Communications. Netscape provided an unparalleled learning oppor-  
tunity, and I gained much insight about product and leadership by  
workingforandwithtrulybrilliantminds,includingMarcAndreessen,  
Barry Appelman, Jennifer Bailey, Jim Barksdale, Peter Currie, Eric  
Hahn, Basil Hashem, Mike Homer, Ben Horowitz, Omid Kordestani,

Eachoneofthesepeoplehasdirectlyinfluencedmeandinformed  
specific topics in this book, either by their explicit help and coaching  
or simply by way of their leadership and actions that I was fortunate  
enough to witness first hand.  
While my time working for these exceptional companies was an  
invaluable learning experience, I found that as I began working with  
tech teams in my advisory and coaching work as part of SVPG, I ben-  
efited greatly by getting a chance to meet and work with the product  
leaders at many of the very best companies in our industry. There are  
simply too many people to list, but they know who they are, and I am  
grateful to every one of them.

my wife and children. About the Author
