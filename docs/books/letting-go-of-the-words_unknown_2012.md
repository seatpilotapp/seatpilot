# Praise for Letting Go of the Words  
“Short of having Ginny sitting at your desk helping you think about your site, I can think of nothing better than  
having this book. The table of contents alone offers detailed guidance for readers, making this book an active  
resource for day-to-day use – one of my key criteria for a ‘usable’ book. The wealth of examples makes it easy  
to see how to apply concepts to your particular situation.”  
Duane Degler  
Principal, Design for Context  
“I have been using Ginny’s book to teach my Writing for the Web course for the past three years. Students love  
it because the guidelines in each chapter are straightforward and are well supported by skillfully selected  
examples. With the addition of various cases and new and updated visual aids in the most recent edition, the  
book is a valuable teaching resource that helps me organize productive classroom discussions and develop  
individual and collaborative projects.”  
Natalia Matveeva, Ph.D.  
Assistant Professor, Professional Writing, University of Houston – Downtown  
“Ginny’s first edition has been right at the top of my ‘most valuable books about web sites’ list, and I refer to it  
constantly. It’s an excellent resource for anyone planning to create, revise, critique, or contribute to a web site.  
It looks at all aspects of what makes web sites clear and easy to use. The book itself is a model of good writing  
and presentation – clear and concise, beautifully formatted, showing as well as telling how to write for the Web.  
I look forward eagerly to the second edition.”  
Penny Lane  
the Center for Health Literacy at MAXIMUS  
“People come to my online writing teams from many different backgrounds. Letting Go of the Words has been an  
indispensible resource for making sure everyone is level set with the basic principles and best practices for online  
communication. Whether you are writing for a web site, portal, app, blog, or online learning course, you will find  
tips here that will help you reach your target audience with just the right number of compelling, useful words.”  
Chris Frederick Willis

most valuable resource in my professional library.”

About Ginny Redish 333 This page intentionally left blank Foreword  
For the past five years, every time I’ve given a talk about  
usability I’ve had a slide near the end to remind me to  
recommend Letting Go of the Words.  
Here’s what I say when I get to it\:  
“This is probably one of the best pieces of advice I can  
give you\:  
If you know anyone who writes or edits for the Web, they have  
to have a copy of this book.”  
When I say it, I always see some people nodding their heads in  
agreement \(more with each passing year\). To drive the point home,  
I pick one of them and ask,  
“I’m right, aren’t I? It really is a great book, isn’t it?”  
The response is always some very enthusiastic variation of “Yes!”  
Personally, I think the first edition was so good that it could have stayed  
just the way it was for many more years.  
And I can tell you from experience that there are two things that strike  
fear in the heart of any author facing the prospect of writing a second  
edition\:  
1\. New topics. There are always things worth adding – things you’ve  
figured out since you wrote it, and things that have suddenly  
become important to your readers. The problem is working them in.  
Since it usually feels like a miracle that you got the whole thing to  
hold together and make sense in the first place, if you do more than  
just drop a paragraph in here and there, you know there’s a good  
chance you might end up feeling like a kid who’s taken a clock  
apart. Not good.  
xxi xxii Foreword  
2\. New examples. People who haven’t written a book full of examples  
have no idea how hard it is to come up with them. It takes a ridicu-  
lous amount of work, so they’re precious. Letting an old one go, and  
finding a new one to replace it, can be a terrifying prospect.  
Just thinking about these makes me want to reach for the TV remote.  
But not Ginny.  
She didn’t just throw in a paragraph here and there about SEO, content  
strategy, accessibility, mobile sites, or social media. She figured out  
what we really need to know about them, and made them play nicely  
with all the other concepts she’d already explained so well. She  
embedded them, like war correspondents.  
In fact, she didn’t just update the book. She rethought and rewrote the  
whole darned thing.  
Knowing her as I do, I’m afraid it’s just a case of too much integrity\: She  
couldn’t not do the right thing.1  
And then there’s her pesky passion for wanting the written word to be  
clear and understandable and accessible for everyone.  
Oh, well. Leave it to Ginny to take something so useful and make it even  
better.  
So here’s my revised recommendation when I give talks from now on\:  
“If you know someone who writes or edits words that appear  
on a screen, buy them a copy of this book. They’ll be your  
friend for life.  
If you own the first edition, give it to a friend and buy this  
one for yourself. Like Godfather II, it’s that rarest of  
creatures\: a sequel to something great that’s even better than  
the original.”  
Steve Krug  
Brookline, Massachusetts, April, 2012

No, I didn’t throw in a double negative just to make Ginny crazy. Even  
Ginny would acknowledge that saying things clearly sometimes involves  
bending the rules. Acknowledgments

Thanks to all of you \(and myriad others who have helped me grow

# What’s the book like?  
Let’s talk about what this book is and what it is not, as well as about  
how you might work with it.  
# Letting Go is about writing and design, not  
# technology  
Letting Go of the Words is about strategy and tactics, not about tools.  
Technology changes too fast to be a major part of the book – and the  
principles of good writing transcend the technology you use.  
# Letting Go includes many examples  
You’ll find many screen shots – often with call-outs to show what works  
well and what I recommend changing. For many of the examples, I show  
how I might revise the content. In consulting projects, I work closely  
with the client to be sure that what I suggest is accurate and consistent  
with the web site’s personality and style. But I haven’t worked with all  
the groups whose sites I show in the book. So, sometimes, my revision is  
my best guess at what might work well.  
Sites and apps change quickly. If you look for an example from the book,  
it may already differ from what I show. That does not invalidate my  
example. Even old examples can make excellent learning opportunities.  
# Letting Go reflects user-experience design  
User-experience design \(UX\) is a philosophy, an approach, and a process  
for creating products that work well for their users. When you practice  
UX, you focus on the people who will use what you create\: their goals,  
their needs, their ways of working, and their environments.  
When you talk to others, you may hear terms like “reader-focused  
writing,” “usability,” and “plain language.” To me, those are all names  
for what we are striving for. They are all part of the same idea; they are  
all aspects of UX.  
# You can jump around in the book  
A book has to be linear, but you don’t have to use it that way. The path  
I’ve set is a logical way to move through the book\:  
•  
planning \(including content strategy\), overall design, home pages,  
pathway pages, and destination pages Let’s continue to converse xxvii  
•  
organizing, headlines, headings, writing, lists and tables, links, and  
illustrations  
•  
getting from first draft to final content, starting an organic style  
guide, and evaluating your site or app or social media strategy  
But that may not be the most logical path for you or your project. Feel  
free to jump around in the book.  
For example, if you are revising a web site, you might want to start with  
the first two chapters and the first interlude and then jump to the end of  
the book, doing a usability test of your current site and developing an  
organic style guide.  
Many people tell me they use the book as an ongoing reference. They  
went all the way through it when they first got it. They come back to it  
over and over when they have a specific question or need. Some use the  
table of contents as a checklist. Find your own path through the book.  
Keep it nearby and use it often.

# Improve internal search  
Getting people to your site is only part of a successful experience.  
Having them find what they need easily on the site is also critical.  
Writing clearly with the words that your site visitors use is the key to  
internal search success as well as to success at external search  
engines.  
# Be accessible to all  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
In the United States, somewhere between 36 million and  
54 million people have a disability. About 7 million people  
have vision problems – and this number is growing as the  
population ages.  
Is yours an e-commerce site? These people have money to  
spend. Are you missing out on having them as customers?  
Is yours an information-rich site? Don’t you want everyone to  
benefit from your information?  
In the United States, all federal government web sites and  
any site paid for with federal government money must be  
accessible to all. Many other countries also require that web  
sites work for everyone. Think of all your potential site visitors  
as you design, develop, and write your web site or app.  
For advice on how to make your site or app universally  
usable, look for the accessibility icon throughout the book.  
# Three case studies  
Content as conversation is a useful mantra for all types of sites. Let’s  
close the chapter with three cases\:  
•  
•  
Mint.com where the writers anticipate site visitors’ questions at  
every step of the conversation  
eBags.com where each product page holds great conversations with  
almost no text  
•  
A city’s site where the text is not at all conversational when it should  
be – and I’ll show you how I would rewrite it

Key messages from Chapter 1\:

People come to web sites to satisfy goals, to do tasks, to get answers  
to questions.  
Navigation, search, design, and technology support the content that  
people come for.  
The best metaphor for the web is phone, not filing cabinet.  
Every use of your web site is a conversation started by your site  
visitor.  
Social media is pushing the web to be even more conversational.  
To have good conversations through your web site\:  
–  
Answer your site visitors’ questions throughout your web content,  
not only in sections called frequently asked questions.  
–  
Let your site visitors “grab and go.”  
–  
Engage your site visitors.  
–  
Market successfully to your site visitors by first satisfying the  
conversation they came to have.  
–  
Improve search engine optimization \(SEO\) and internal site  
search.  
–  
Be accessible to all. This page intentionally left blank Purposes,

# Personas,  
# Conversations  
Successful writers don’t start by writing. They plan before they write  
\(and they plan while they write and through all their revisions\).  
At every level and for every piece of content \(entire site, web page,  
mobile app or site, social media message, blog article\), start by asking  
yourself\:  
•  
•  
Why?  
Who?  
•  
What’s the conversation?  
Your site = you = one side of the conversation. You have to know what  
you want that conversation to accomplish.  
Your site visitor = the other side of the conversation. To have successful  
conversations with your site visitors, you must understand them and  
what they need and want.  
Planning is part of developing a  
content strategy. See Interlude 1  
right after this chapter.  
You might call what I’m covering  
here your creative brief.  
# Why? Know what you want to  
# achieve  
You may want to make money, reduce phone calls, increase phone calls,  
have people be able to access the site wherever they are and whenever  
they want, or have people come to your site before any others for your  
topic.

# You can find out lots about your  
# site visitors  
Later in this chapter, I’ll show how to turn data about your site visitors  
into personas and scenarios. First, let’s talk about how to get that data.  
To understand your site visitors, start with these four steps, which you’ll  
probably cycle through a few times.  
1.  
Gather information about your site visitors.  
2.  
List groups of site visitors.  
3\. List major characteristics for each group.  
4.  
Understand the conversations they want to start.  
# 1\.  Gather information about your site  
# visitors  
You can start to understand your site visitors by thinking about them.  
But that’s not enough. To really understand who they are, why they come  
to your site, what they need, and how to write web content for them, you  
have to know them and their realities.  
If you write your web content based only on what you think your site  
visitors are like, you will be writing from assumptions. If your  
assumptions are wrong, your content won’t work.  
Here are several suggestions for finding out about your site visitors. They  
are all valuable, but best is actually watching, listening to, and talking with  
current or potential site visitors. That gives you a truer picture than any of  
the just thinking techniques or information filtered through other people.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Think about your mission. Whom are you supposed to serve? What are  
you supposed to help them accomplish?  
Read the emails that come through Contact Us and other feedback  
links. Who is writing? What are they asking?  
Read feedback from your web pages. \(Give people an easy way to  
send feedback on your web pages.\)  
Read reviews, recommendations, blogs that mention your site, your  
topics, or where your site visitors are likely to express themselves.  
Talk to colleagues in Customer Service. Who is calling with questions?  
What are those questions?  
Talk to colleagues in Marketing. Whom are they targeting?

Chapter 2 • Planning\: Purposes, Personas, Conversations  
Talk to colleagues in Usability and User Experience. What have they  
already learned in their user research?  
Analyze your site search logs. See what site visitors are trying to find  
through your site’s Search box. See the words they are using to find  
what they need.  
Use web analytics. Learn where people are coming from, where they  
go on your site, how long they stay, when and where they leave,  
and the words they search with at Google and other search engines.  
Web analytics give you interesting facts. However, they don’t  
explain “why?” Did people leave a page quickly because it was  
wonderful and gave them just what they needed? Or did they leave  
quickly because their first glance told them it would not help  
them?  
Use social media. Participate in relevant online discussion groups  
and communities where you can raise questions to people like your  
site visitors.  
Track social media conversations that mention you, your brand, your  
company, your site.  
Get people who come to the site to fill out a short questionnaire. Ask  
people a few questions about themselves, why they came to the site,  
and whether they were successful in finding what they came for.  
Interview people who use or might use your web site. Use these  
­ techniques\:  
–  
Contextual interviewing \(watch and listen as people work\)  
–  
Critical incident interviewing \(ask people to tell you their stories of  
specific times when they used the site\)  
Watch and listen to people in other places.  
–  
If your web site mirrors a brick-and-mortar business, observe and  
listen to customers in the physical location.  
–  
If yours is a government site, realize that government agencies  
often have “brick-and-mortar” equivalents. Spend time in a local  
office of the agency, watching and listening for whatever is rele-  
vant to your web content.  
–  
If your site is for a nonprofit with projects, programs, and grants,  
go see what your grantees’ lives are really like. You may see that  
they have technology challenges and very hectic days. You may  
hear what topics are most important to them, what they value,  
what words they use. If you can’t go out in the field yourself, talk  
to people who spend time with your grantees.  
Do usability testing of the current content. Watch and listen to people  
as they work with your site. You can have them show you tasks they

Social and cultural environments and language  
\(“context of use”\)  
You should also understand where and when people come to your content.  
Are your typical site visitors likely to be  
•  
alone or with someone else?  
•  
•  
in an office cubicle or at home or at the public library or walking  
down the street looking at their smart phone?  
in a different country or from a culture that is different from yours  
\(even within the same country\)? How well do they know the language  
of your site?  
Are your typical site visitors likely to be  
•  
•  
coming directly to your site or coming through a search engine like  
Google? \(If so, search engine optimization \(SEO\) will be a very  
important consideration.\)  
very interested in participating in social media, user-generated  
content, and interactivity? Or would they rather just find static  
information or complete a task?  
Are your typical site visitors likely to be  
•  
•  
•  
interrupted as they work with your information? \(This might be true  
for most office workers. It’s also likely to be true for a parent  
shopping from home while the kids are playing.\)  
on your site for a long time every day? \(This would be the case for  
some applications.\)  
answering questions for someone else, so they might have  
someone on the phone waiting for the answer while they try to get  
that answer from your content? \(This would be the case with the  
customer service group in an e-commerce environment, for  
example.\)  
Demographics  
Age may matter for your site. If you are writing content for a particular  
age group – for example, for young children or for teens – that will likely  
affect your writing style as well as the design of your site.  
But age isn’t all there is to demographics. Recent studies of older adults  
have shown how diverse the audience of 50+ or even 65+ is. Even  
within the older adult audience, you have to think about differences in  
computer and web expertise \(aptitude\), in feelings about the web  
\(attitude\), and in ability \(vision and other problems\).

Also remember that if you see a statistic such as 75% of 16- to 24-year-olds  
are active on social media sites, that means that 25% are not!  
# 4\.  Understand the conversations they  
# want to start  
All of the ways I listed earlier for finding out about your site visitors give  
you information about both who they are and why they come to your web  
site. Let me add two more guidelines for helping you get your site visitors’  
stories.  
Don’t translate  
As you gather people’s questions, tasks, and stories, note their words.  
Don’t rewrite what they say into your jargon.  
Finding out the words site visitors use to describe what they want and  
need is critical. Then you’ll have their vocabulary to use in your content.  
Analyze site searches  
One way to see site visitors’ words is to analyze the words they use to  
search at your site. Site search analysis does not tell you who but does  
tell you what site visitors are trying to find – in their words.  
# Breathing life into your data  
# with personas  
When you’ve done the user research we’ve talked about so far in this  
chapter, you’ll have a lot of facts about your site visitors. But it may be  
hard to imagine real people in the facts you’ve gathered. Do the facts  
seem dry? Do they lack “human interest” – a real sense of the people  
your content is for?  
A great way to bring your web or app users “alive” for yourself and your  
team is to create personas.  
# What is a persona?  
A persona is an individual with a name, a picture, specific demographics,  
and other characteristics. A persona is, however, not usually based on one  
actual individual. Rather, each persona is a composite of characteristics  
of real people in the group the persona represents.  
A very important point\: As you create your personas, you must be true to the  
data you have so that the personas represent your site visitors – not you.

personas in design. Cooper,

analyze\_current/personas.html 32 Chapter 2 • Planning\: Purposes, Personas, Conversations  
Demographics  
Demographics \(age, family status, education level, and so on\) are  
important, both to identify which groups of site visitors the persona  
represents and to make the persona “real” to everyone.  
Quotes, values, stories, tasks, and more  
Use the data you gathered. Include whatever is going to be important to  
the team as they design and write. In this chapter, you see just a few of  
many ways to present personas\:  
•  
•  
•  
Win’s persona has questions and answers.  
Edith’s persona has a quote, a bulleted list, and a short narrative.  
The posters for Ari, Valerie, and Susan \(Figure 2-6 on page 33\) have  
different colored backgrounds to help distinguish them.  
# How many personas?  
Most of the web sites I have helped have several primary site visitor  
groups and, therefore, find they need more than one major persona.  
•  
•  
•

# ACCESS  
You may want to have a persona who uses assistive  
technology, such as a screen-reader or screen magnifier.  
Although the persona’s special need will be only one of  
many special needs among all your potential site visitors,  
your persona \(for example, someone with vision problems\)  
will remind the web team to always make sure that  
everything on the site is accessible to everyone.  
# How do personas work with a  
# web team?  
For your home page, you probably need to keep all your personas in mind.  
For a specific web page, you may be conversing with only one or a few of  
the site’s personas.  
Personas become members of your web team. Figure 2-6 shows how one  
team keeps their persona in clear view as they work. Breathing life into your data with scenarios 33

they plan and design.

What questions will Kristin ask about these shoes we want her to  
buy?  
•  
When Sanjay comes to this web site, will he search or navigate?  
What search terms will he use to get to the content I am writing?  
These are just a few of the ways that personas have become members of  
web teams\:

Personas come to team meetings as life-size cardboard cutouts.  
Personas’ pictures and information hang on the wall in the team’s  
work space. The social media strategist for HipHopDX has done that,  
and Ahava Leibtag \(their content strategy consultant\) says that  
contributed to their 47% increase in traffic in the past year.  
Personas’ pictures and information are printed on place mats or  
mouse pads so that they are on the table at meetings and in team  
members’ work spaces.  
Emails from personas and about them circulate in the team.

reasons for coming to your web site. \(Look back at Win and Edith.\) 36 Chapter 2 • Planning\: Purposes, Personas, Conversations

Planning your content is critical for apps, web sites, individual web  
topics, blogs, social media messages – everything you write.  
Planning means asking\: Why? Who? What conversations?  
To have successful conversations, you have to know  
–  
what you want to achieve through your content  
–  
who you are conversing with  
–  
what they want from your app, your site, your topic, your  
message; what task they want to accomplish  
List all your purposes. Try to make them measurable.  
Understand that your readers are not blank slates. We all interpret  
as we read, bringing the baggage of our past experience and our own  
understanding of what words mean.  
Know your readers.  
–  
You have many ways to learn about your site visitors.  
–  
Gathering data from real sources from analytics to social media to  
site visits and usability testing is much better than making  
assumptions about your site visitors.  
List major characteristics for each group of site visitors, including\:  
–  
key phrases or quotes  
–  
experience, expertise  
–  
emotions  
–  
values  
–  
technology  
–  
social and cultural environments and language  
–  
demographics  
Gather site visitors’ questions, tasks, and stories.  
Use your information to create personas.  
Use your information to write scenarios.  
–  
Scenarios tell you the conversations people want to start.  
–  
Everything on your site should fulfill a scenario.  
–  
Scenarios can help you write good content. 46 Chapter 3 • Designing for Easy Use  
For successful conversations, you must develop design and content  
together. Waiting until the end and just pouring content into a design  
that was created without real content is a recipe for disaster.  
# Who should read this chapter –  
# and why?  
Content and design are deeply intertwined. That’s why I think it is critical  
to have a chapter on design in a book about content – and why I think that  
every book about web design should have a chapter on writing web content.  
•  
•  
•  
If you are a designer, read at least up to the section on color on  
page 51. Involving content strategists and content writers early and  
continuously will greatly reduce last-minute frustration for all of you  
and greatly increase the probability of launching a successful  
product.  
If you are a content specialist, my goal is to give you an overview of  
some important points about information design so you can collaborate  
well with designers. This whole chapter is for you. I hope you are working  
with visual designers to be certain that decisions on color, space, fonts,  
and so on allow site visitors to easily see and read the content.  
If you wear both hats, this chapter gives you ways of talking about  
content and design that should help you when you’re collaborating  
with people who don’t have your skills.  
My two first broad guidelines\:  
•  
•  
Integrate content and design from the beginning.  
Build in flexibility for universal usability.  
Then, I have just a few guidelines for you in each of three categories\:  
•  
Color  
•  
•  
Space  
Typography  
\(I realize that each of these three specific topics could – and does – fill  
entire books. For each, I have just a few points I want to be sure that you  
are thinking about as you – designers and content folk – work together.\)  
# Integrate content and design from  
# the beginning  
I hope that all of you – content strategists, content writers, and  
designers – are working together with a list of all the content types the Integrate content and design from the beginning 47  
site will have, as well as how, when, and where the different types of  
content will appear on your site or in your app.  
I also hope that you are working closely with other team members –  
brand, business, documentation, marketing, and social media strategists,  
as well as information architects and user experience specialists.  
Look back at the list of content  
types in Interlude 1 on content  
strategy. Note that content  
includes much more than text –  
illustrations of all types, video,  
audio, interactive elements, and  
so on.  
# Answer content and design questions  
# together  
Content specialists and designers must work together to answer large  
questions like these\:  
•  
•  
•  
What types of content will appear on each type of page \(home page,  
pathway pages, catalog pages, information pages\)?  
How will the content and the presentation of that content differ for  
large screens and for small screens \(classic web, tablet, mobile\)?  
How will what you do for web and app work well with what you do  
for social media?  
And more detailed questions like these\:  
•  
•  
For catalog pages\: What specific pieces of information will each item  
in the catalog have? How much space \(character count\) will you allow  
for descriptions? Will you have videos? Interactive elements?  
For articles\: How long will typical headlines and headings be in the  
content? How many levels of headings will typical articles need? Will  
information pages have same-page links? Where will you put them?  
Will you have a photo, a video, or other nontext elements with the text?  
Design decisions that constrain what writers can do come up at every  
stage as design progresses. Content specialists must, therefore, be part  
of all those decisions.  
# Use real content throughout the process  
The tradition in design has been to use dummy text that starts with the  
words lorem ipsum dolor as content during design. Using this text is  
called “greeking” even though the words are Latin and not Greek. \(Greek  
would be in a different alphabet.\)  
The reason I’ve typically heard for using dummy text is that it lets  
people concentrate on design features without being distracted by the  
content. But why do that? The design has to support meaningful  
content, so we should evaluate design and content together.  
More about the history and use of  
lorem ipsum\: www.lipsum.com Some colorful hats  
As seen by a person  
with deuteranopia,  
a form of red/green  
color-blindness  
Figure 3-4 www.vischeck.com  
What you see as bright and different colors may not appear that way to everyone else.  
Selecting colors that work for people with different variants of color-  
blindness is not simple. It isn’t as easy as just avoiding all reds or all  
greens. The shade of red or green matters. And other colors can be  
problematic in combination with certain reds and greens.  
# Think about the cultural meaning  
# of colors  
Universal usability also means being sensitive to differences in language  
and culture both within your own country and across borders. Some  
graphics and colors are pretty much universal. You can drive almost  
anywhere and assume that a traffic light has red, amber, and green; that  
red means stop and green means go.  
Colors also evoke connotations like aggressive, soothing, cheerful,  
luxurious – and those connotations differ across cultures. Colors are  
sometimes associated with political parties, which, of course, are  
country-specific. Rather than spout a few factoids about specific colors  
in specific cultures, the best advice I can give you is to test your site  
with people from the different cultures that you want to reach.  
# Color  
In the early days of the web, we often saw an exuberance of design with  
wildly colorful – but not usable – web pages. Design exuberance can be  
wonderful – if it matches the personality of your site. But it also has to  
work with and not against the content. If you want people to read what you  
are putting on your site, you must make the text and illustrations legible.  
Color 51  
The best way to know if your web  
page is going to work is to have  
people who are color-blind test  
it. You can use sites like  
www.vischeck.com and  
www.checkmycolors.com  
to get a preliminary view of how  
your web pages will look to  
people with different types of  
vision problems.  
Be wary of factoids you read on  
web sites. Many are old or urban  
legends.  
The rest of this chapter focuses  
on color, space, and typography  
for text. Although words are not  
the only part of your content, they  
are a vital part – and the part  
that I know best. Illustrations –  
Chapter 13. As I say in Chapter 13,  
you’ll have to look beyond this  
book for best practices in  
creating great videos. 62 Chapter 3 • Designing for Easy Use  
Whether a font has serifs is not the whole story. Within each of those  
broad categories, fonts differ in other features such as how wide the  
rounded parts of letters like “b” and “d” are, how high lowercase letters  
like “x” are compared to the overall height of letters like “h,” how  
clearly the font distinguishes between the letter “l” and the number  
“1,” how close together the letters are to each other, and so on.  
Even at the same point size, different fonts take up different amounts of  
space on the screen. Try it for yourself by typing the same sentence  
several times and then changing the font but not the point size for each  
rendition of the sentence.  
Based on research in the mid-twentieth century, people often said that  
serif fonts were better for sustained reading. A common explanation was  
that the serifs at the bottom of the letters draw the eye horizontally along  
the line of type.  
However, relying on that research for your web content may not serve  
your site visitors well for several reasons\:  
•  
•  
The research is now more than 60 years old.  
Serif fonts were the norm then. People had little familiarity with  
sans serif.  
•  
•  
With just a point or two more space between lines of type \(“leading” –  
a word from the days when printers put a slug of lead between rows of  
type\), you can make even a paper document in sans serif very readable.  
On the web, we break information into small pieces with small  
paragraphs, short sentences, lists, and tables.  
\(An aside\: Even on paper, you may want to use an appropriate sans serif.  
This book is in Trade Gothic, a sans serif font.\)  
Research on web content has not shown a consistent winner between  
serif and sans serif for either reading speed or comprehension. But  
preference almost always favors the familiar sans serif fonts. It may be  
familiarity; people see most sites in these sans serif fonts. It may be that  
a site in serif font looks like a paper document; it seems old-fashioned.  
AAA  
Researchers who work with low-vision readers recommend  
familiar sans serif fonts for both paper and web.  
# ACCESS  
Of course, you do not entirely control what your site visitors see. They  
may have their browser set to always show a particular font. However, as  
the default, select a highly legible sans serif font. Select one that most Typography 63  
of your site visitors are likely to have available on their computers. If you  
choose an unusual font, most people won’t see your content in that font  
because browsers only use what the specific computer has available. Do  
usability testing to make sure your default results in legible pages.  
# 2\.  Make the default text size legible  
# for your visitors  
Online, you are balancing how much to say and the space for saying it.  
If you only have a certain amount of screen “real estate” for your  
content, you either have to write fewer words or make the type smaller.  
That’s a good reason to let go of words and focus on your key messages.  
If the type is too small, people won’t read what you wrote. Write less.  
Use type large enough for your site visitors to read easily.  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
Consider all your personas. You may be much younger than  
many of your site visitors. You may have much better vision  
than they do. Most people develop vision problems as they  
age. Cater to them on your site.  
# 3\. Set a medium line length as the default  
This is a paragraph of information written in Verdana with a line length of 100 characters per line.  
Although university students in one research study read lines that were this long faster than shorter  
lines, in another study, other students read the medium lines fastest. In both studies, the students  
preferred the medium line length. Do you find this comfortable to read?  
This is a paragraph of information written in Verdana  
with a line length of 50 characters per line. This is the  
length that students preferred even when they read  
longer lines faster. Research on paper over many  
years found that people do best with lines of text  
about this long. Do you find this comfortable to read?  
This is a paragraph of  
information written in  
Verdana with a line  
length of 25 characters  
per line. Whole  
paragraphs in very  
short lines are difficult  
for people because it’s  
hard to get the  
meaning with so few  
words on a line. Do  
you find this  
comfortable to read? Summarizing Chapter 3 71

Use italics sparingly. This page intentionally left blank 2\. Identify the site 75  
search engine programmers know that. So the search engines throw out  
sites and pages that have the same words too many times on the page.  
No one knows just what the threshold is for the search engines to say  
“too much,” but you don’t have to write a lot to get good SEO. Of  
course, in this book, I’m describing best practice \(“white hat”\) SEO.  
# Remarkable content matters  
Search engines rank the quality of your site in part by how many other  
sites link to yours and the quality of those sites. As Brian Halligan and  
Dharmesh Shah say in their book, Inbound Marketing, “The best way to  
rank well in the Google search results is to create content that is rank-  
worthy.” \(emphasis added\)  
Halligan and Shah also say that you want remarkable content, italicizing  
the front part of “remarkable” to remind us that the word means “worthy  
of other people’s remarks.” If you have a remarkable content strategy  
and remarkable content, you’ll do well in SEO.  
# 2\. Identify the site  
People want to know “Whose site is this?” “Did I get the site I was going  
to?” And you want them to recognize the site, relate to your brand, and  
develop brand loyalty so that they’ll come back to the site.  
Your site’s logo, name, and tag line must identify it. Don’t use a  
paragraph to explain the site. Don’t put paragraph-long mission  
statements on the home page. Most people won’t read them.  
Instead, encapsulate your company or organization’s key message in a  
memorable tag line – a short phrase that tells people how to think about  
the site.

Who decides on the site’s personality?  
If you own the site \(it’s your blog; it’s your company; you are an  
independent artist or writer; it’s your Facebook wall\), you decide on  
the tone and personality you want to project.  
However, if you are part of a larger organization, it’s not your decision  
alone. In fact, another group \(Marketing, Corporate Communications,  
Web Services\) may dictate aspects of the site’s brand – colors, layout,  
writing style.  
Don’t arbitrarily reject those decisions. A lot of effort may have gone  
into choices within a content strategy, brand strategy, message  
architecture, social media strategy.  
If you want to influence the site’s personality, get involved.  
Communicate up the chain and across groups. Become part of  
whatever teams are working on these issues.  
As you consider the right tone and personality for the site, think  
broadly about all the organization’s site visitors, not just those who  
come for your part of the site. A web site is the whole organization’s  
face to the world.  
# 4\.  Help people get a sense of what

The key is to know what questions about the product are uppermost  
in your site visitors’ minds. That’s the conversation they want to  
have. You help them by answering those conversations on your  
gallery pages.  
Technology products – for example, binoculars, cameras, computers,  
phones – are often not differentiated enough with just pictures. We need  
more information on the gallery page than you see in Figure 5-4.  
Figure 5-4 www.nokia.com  
These pictures won’t help most site visitors even select what to compare.  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
And remember that some of your site visitors can’t see any  
of those pictures. If you use picture-based gallery pages,  
you must have descriptive ALT-text for blind and low-vision  
site visitors. They have money. They come to buy. Don’t  
abandon them part way through their conversations.  
# Write in fragments  
The short descriptions on the Shell page in Figure 5-1 are each one or  
two complete sentences, and they work well. But so do the tidbits of  
information on the Zappos and Lands’ End pages in Figures 5-2 and 5-3.  
On gallery pages, you don’t always need complete sentences. Short  
descriptions can be fragments or bulleted items. Your site visitors aren’t  
in “read” mode; they’re in “help me choose” mode.  
# 5\. Three clicks is a myth  
Of course, everyone in the organization wants their content to be just  
one click from the home page. But you can only do that if the web site is  
tiny. Most web sites need pathway pages, so the question becomes\: How  
short must the pathway be? 6\. Many people choose the first option 99  
After watching hundreds of usability test sessions, my answer is that the  
smoothness of the path is more important than the number of clicks  
\(within reason\). If your site visitors are moving steadily on a successful  
path – following great scent of information – they won’t even realize  
they’ve clicked four or five times instead of three.  
Tom Brinck and his colleagues at Diamond Bullet Design revised a web  
site through a user-centered process, taking it from an internal-organization  
focus to a user-task focus. Much of the information on the new site ended  
up one level deeper – requiring one more click – but time to find the right  
information went way down and task success went up.  
To organize – or reorganize – a  
site as Brinck and his colleagues  
did, follow the steps in Interlude  
1 on content strategy. Also, do a  
card-sorting study and work with  
an information architect.

# Don’t make people think  
Your site visitors want to get to the right place quickly and efficiently. If  
they have to stop and think about what to do at each step on the  
pathway, it’s not efficient – nor is it quick.  
# Keep people from needing to go back  
If people can’t find the right link to move forward easily, they’ll hop part  
way down one path, back up to try another path, down that second path,  
possibly back up again, and so on. Jared Spool calls this “pogo-sticking.”  
Don’t make site visitors do this. They get frustrated and leave. If people  
use the Back button while trying to find what they need on your site,  
rethink your information architecture – your pathway pages.  
# 6\.  Many people choose the  
# first option  
Humans don’t act optimally. As Herbert Simon pointed out many years  
ago, we “satisfice.” We trade time for benefit – often without realizing  
we are doing it. We make decisions based on what seems “good enough”  
without exploring all the options.  
The wording and guideline come  
from Steve Krug’s Don’t Make Me  
Think!, 2005. 100 Chapter 5 • Getting There\: Pathway Pages  
Busy site visitors click as soon as they see a link that looks as if it might  
work for them. And the younger your site visitors are, the more likely  
they are to jump to act.  
•  
Think carefully about the order of information on pathway pages.  
•  
Put the most important links high on the page.  
•  
If you want people to select one option over another, put the one you  
want them to select first.  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
Many site visitors who listen to the screen also choose the  
first option they hear that sounds reasonable. However,  
older site visitors – at least in the current generation –  
tend to be more cautious clickers, looking over all the  
options before choosing. But they, too, will usually decide  
that what comes first must be the best choice.

If your site is large enough, you may need pathway pages between  
the home page and the information people want.  
Pathway pages are just that – a way to navigate down a path to the  
information, product, service, or task the site visitor needs.  
Site visitors hunt like bloodhounds for what they need.  
They don’t want to read while hunting.  
–  
They don’t want to be distracted.  
–  
Welcoming messages and long marketing messages don’t work  
well on pathway pages.  
A pathway page is like a table of contents. It should be mostly links.  
Sometimes, short descriptions help. However, remember these points\:

Watch the jargon.

Don’t assume a picture is enough with no description or specs  
\(especially for technology products\).

It’s okay to write in fragments.  
Three clicks is a myth. The smoothness of the path is more  
important than the number of clicks \(within reason\).  
–  
Don’t make people think on pathway pages.  
–  
Keep people from needing to go back.  
Many people choose the first option, so think carefully about what  
you put first. 6Breaking up  
# and Organizing  
# Content  
Huge documents, dense web pages, and most PDFs are like lectures  
where one person \(the writer\) takes up all the time and space.  
Successful web experiences are conversations.  
Over the next four chapters, we’ll look at various aspects of this key  
guideline\: Don’t hog the conversation.  
We’ll work on  
•  
•  
•  
•  
breaking up and organizing your content \(this chapter\)  
answering site visitors’ questions, letting go of words, layering  
content, starting with key messages, and breaking up walls of words  
\(Chapter 7\)  
announcing your topic with an informative headline \(Chapter 8\)  
writing useful headings within the topic \(Chapter 9\)  
In this chapter, we tackle four important guidelines\:  
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  
Think “information,” not “document.”  
Divide your content thoughtfully.  
Consider how much to put on one web page.  
Use PDFs sparingly and only for good reasons.

101 112 Chapter 6 • Breaking up and Organizing Content  
# Divide web content by life event  
On some sites, the content is for people at different stages of life. These  
sites are often about babies or elders – focusing on getting started or on  
retiring. Figure 6-10 shows how Baby Center takes families from before  
pregnancy through their child’s life stages.  
Figure 6-10 www.babycenter.com  
The chronology of life is the major organizer for this web site.  
# Divide web content by time or sequence  
Our seventh and last way of dividing content is by time or sequence.  
Something happens first, then something else, and so on. For example,  
Bank of America takes site visitors through a series of interactive videos  
to help them make good decisions about buying a home \(Figure 6-11\).  
Figure 6-11 Although you can work through these interactive videos in any order, the  
sequence helps site visitors see the steps in buying a home.  
http\://myhome.bankofamerica.com  
Don’t organize by your org chart!  
I’ve shown you several ways that work well for organizing web sites.  
The one way that does not usually work well is having the web site  
mirror your internal organization.  
Your content and information architecture should not rely on your site  
visitors knowing the internal workings of the agency, company, or  
nonprofit. 116 Chapter 6 • Breaking up and Organizing Content  
For large documents, large reports, large sets of disparate information,  
use the index card model\: Create a mini web site with a table of  
contents \(pathway page\) where each link leads to a separate page for  
that part of the document or report or for each topic in the set.  
Write informative titles or  
headlines for each topic. Write  
informative headings for each  
section that you break out from a  
large document or report.  
Headlines – Chapter 8  
Headings – Chapter 9  
# How long is the page?  
Even in the Powell’s model, you have to consider how much information  
you have on each topic\: How long would each “index card” have to be to  
cover everything about a single topic?  
Most people today will scroll vertically \(not horizontally\) if the page  
layout indicates that the page continues. But they won’t scroll  
forever. Think of three or four scrolls’ worth as a maximum length for  
a web page.  
# What’s the download time?  
You may be working on a very fast connection. Your site visitors may not.  
And consider the mobile experience. On mobiles, downloads can happen  
very slowly, even if the provider claims high speed connections.  
Conversations should proceed smoothly. If people have to wait a long  
time for your response, they may be annoyed – especially if your  
response includes much more than they wanted.  
On the other hand, if you break the information onto many small pages  
and your site visitors need all of it to get what they need, waiting for  
each one to load may be annoying. You’re conversing in fits and starts,  
not smoothly. And the time between pages may make it hard for site  
visitors to put the information together in their heads.  
So you have to think about the issue of download time together with the  
issues of how much of the information people want and how connected  
it is in their minds.  
# How much do people want to print?  
If people want just one part of the information and have to print pages  
and pages to get it, they waste ink, paper, and time. That’s frustrating. If  
you break the information into very short pieces and people have to print  
several web pages in succession to get what they need, that’s also  
frustrating. So you have to consider who will want to print and what they  
will want to print.  
Make sure that your pages print  
well. Always include a way for  
people to print the content  
without losing the end of each  
line of text. 120 Chapter 6 • Breaking up and Organizing Content  
# When might a PDF file be appropriate?  
If you are using your web site to distribute white papers, annual reports,  
journal articles, or other material that you expect people to print and use  
on paper, and if your site visitors are comfortable with PDF files, PDF  
may be the right way to go.  
Distribution is the great advantage that the Internet has over paper, even  
for paper documents.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
You save printing and shipping costs; you shift printing to readers.  
Many people would rather go online than trudge down to the  
physical library.  
People can get what they want any time – no need to know when the  
library is open; no need to work only in daytime.  
Searching online may be quicker than hunting in the library – no  
need to understand the way the library organizes journals; no need  
to hunt through the library shelves; no worries that someone has  
already taken out that issue or cut out the article.  
Even people who don’t live near a library or who are in countries  
where mail delivery is slow or unreliable can get instant access.  
But you don’t need PDF to get information to anyone, anywhere, at any  
time. The Internet serves all these distribution needs through regular  
web pages, too.  
Another appropriate use of PDF is fillable forms, where you need  
people to fill out what is essentially still a paper form. With PDF, you  
can set up the form so people fill it out online and send it to you  
online.  
# Sometimes, having both PDF and  
# HTML is best  
The web sites of most professional journals give subscribers the option  
of both PDF and HTML versions of articles. In my usability studies for  
two different journals, I found the same results\: Subscribers like having  
both versions. They use them differently. When they need to study the  
article carefully offline, they save or print the PDF. When they want to  
skim the article, check a fact, grab a quote, or use a graphic \(with  
permission and credit\), they choose the HTML.  
For white papers, annual reports, and other compilations of information,  
you might also want to offer both PDF and HTML of the entire document. 4\. Use PDFs sparingly and only for good reasons 121  
But you also should consider setting up the content in small, reusable  
pieces that you put together in different ways.  
For example, the white paper might be a PDF that you want people to  
download. But you might also have a series of blog articles from  
different points in the white paper. You might extract key message  
tidbits for social media messages. You might pull pieces of the  
information into HTML pages. And in all of these formats, you link to the  
other options. This increases your inbound links, helps your SEO, and  
contributes to marketing your content.  
# When is a PDF file not appropriate?  
For many situations, however, PDF is not the way to build a useful,  
usable web site – especially when the PDF is the only way you offer the  
information. PDF is a poor choice when your site visitors  
•  
don’t want the whole document  
•  
•  
•  
are mostly on mobile devices  
don’t want to print  
are not comfortable with PDF files  
•  
need accessible information \(And you should always consider  
accessibility!\)  
When people don’t want the whole document  
If your site visitors come for information and the PDF has more than  
they need, a PDF defeats the very purpose and nature of the web.  
Yes, PDF files are searchable, but people don’t want to first navigate or  
search to get the document and then have to navigate or search in a  
different way within the document.  
Yes, you can have a linked table of contents that lets people jump to a  
specific place in a PDF document; but most PDF files are just put up on  
the web with no attention to internal links.  
When people are mostly on mobile devices  
Reading a PDF on the small screen of a smart phone has to be a pretty  
excruciating experience.  
When people don’t want to print  
Why make the document look just like paper if it is not meant to be  
used on paper? Summarizing Chapter 6 123  
Most old PDFs just aren’t good at conversing with your site visitors. For  
all these reasons, make part of your content strategy a plan to remove  
old paper-based PDF files – turning those that still have important  
information into usable, useful web content.

site visitors, drop it entirely, put it at the bottom of the page, or layer it

# Revising content you already have  
Try this process to improve the way your site converses on a specific  
topic\:  
Checklist 7-1  
Process for Selecting Web Content  
1\. Put the content you now have on the topic aside.  
I know this is difficult, but you should rethink your topic without  
being constrained by what the site now says.  
2\. Check strategy and architecture.  
Find out how this topic fits \(or not\) into your organization’s  
content strategy, marketing strategy, social media strategy, and  
information architecture. Should you drop it entirely? Should you  
include it? If it doesn’t fit, stop here.  
3\. Adopt your persona’s perspective.  
Think about the topic from your site visitors’ point of view. Which  
persona\(s\) is this for? Put yourself in those personas’ place.  
4\. List questions.  
What would those personas ask about the topic? \(Use all the  
sources in Chapter 2 to find out what your site visitors want to  
know about this specific topic.\)  
5\. Put the questions in logical order.  
Which question would the personas ask first? Which next? Go  
through your list until you have all the questions in an order that  
is logical to your site visitors. 128 Chapter 7 • Focusing on Conversations and Key Messages  
6\. Cut, paste, rewrite, edit.  
Now, go back to the content you set aside in Step 1. Use it as  
source material to answer the questions you have written down.  
\(It’s okay to cut and paste as long as you edit what you paste so  
that it’s a good, clear answer to the question.\)  
7\. See what’s left.  
Look over what is left in your original. Do your site visitors care  
about any of what is left? Is any of it critical for your site visi-  
tors to know? If they care or if it is critical, write a question that  
your site visitors might ask so that you can give them the  
answer.  
8\. Get more answers.  
If you have questions in your list for which you do not have an  
answer, find the right person and get the information. If it’s a  
question people will ask, taking this step will save phone calls  
later.  
9\. Read your new draft.  
Does it flow logically? Are the questions in your site  
visitors’ words? Are the answers short, straightforward, and  
clear?  
10\. Discard what you have not used.  
If your site visitors neither need nor care about the informa-  
tion, why include it? This may be the most difficult step of  
all, but remember that the web is about what people want  
and need to know, not about saying all there is to say on a  
topic.  
# Writing new content  
The process for new content is very much the same. You can just leave  
out the heart-wrenching first step. Start with Step 2.  
For Step 6, you won’t have old copy as source material. You may have  
other source material. You may have subject matter experts to work with  
\(or you may be the subject matter expert\).  
For Step 7, instead of looking over your original, look over all your source  
material or talk again with your subject matter expert. 4\. Start with your key message 139  
Figure 7-6 This heat map from eye-tracking shows the typical F pattern of web reading on  
information pages. Readers looked most at the first paragraph and then at the beginning of  
bulleted lists. The colors show the concentration of eye fixations, with red indicating the  
heaviest concentrations and blue the least.

# 5\. Layer information  
Layering is a way of dividing web information. When done well, layering  
•  
•  
keeps site visitors from being overwhelmed  
helps site visitors who want different levels of information  
Bite, snack, meal is one way to layer. In the next two sections, I show you  
examples of layering by\:  
•  
•  
opening extra information on top of what site visitors or app users are doing  
progressively disclosing information within the content, letting people  
open and close pieces as needed  
# Layering with an overlay  
You can take advantage of layering to provide definitions, technical  
details, or other “extra” information. When you provide rollovers or open  
a small secondary window on top of the main page, your site visitors  
don’t lose the context.  
Figure 7-7 shows how Traffic.com gives details of traffic problems.  
Figure 7-7 Clicking on any warning symbol on this traffic map brings up a small overlay with  
details of the problem – a good use of layering without losing context.  
www.traffic.com 5\. Layer information 141  
Even on tablets and mobiles, I see some interesting uses of overlays. For  
example, Figure 7-8 shows the details for an airline flight over the map  
showing the flight’s route. Other overlays allow you to add flights to track  
and choose which of the flights you are tracking to look at. The app  
tracks flights in real time.  
Figure 7-8 An overlay on a tablet app.  
# Layering with progressive disclosure  
You can layer within the context in even more innovative ways. Case  
Study 7-2 shows how a team in Washington state helps injured workers  
file and follow their claims. Summarizing Chapter 7 149  
# 7\.  Plan to share and engage  
# through social media  
The need to be succinct in social media reinforces all the guidelines in  
this chapter. Whether you are working within the 140 characters of  
Twitter, putting a message on your Facebook wall, posting to Google+,  
describing a video or slide deck you are sharing through YouTube or  
SlideShare, or using another social media program, you only have room  
for your key message.  
Think “bite, snack, meal.” Put the bite into your social media message.  
Make it engage people so they click on the link to a specific snack in  
your web site. If you have more for them, let the snack lead to a fuller  
meal. But remember to make even the meal easy to digest – no walls of  
words, please.

# Headings  
Let’s move from the headline at the top of your content to the headings  
inside the content. Headings – short and in bold or color – divide your  
web content on a single topic into manageable pieces.  
In a typical conversation, the people who are talking to each other take  
turns. Headings – especially question headings – are your site visitors’  
turns in the conversation.  
# Good headings help readers  
# in many ways  
Well-written headings in well-organized content help readers

# Thinking about headings also  
# helps authors  
Headings form an outline of what you are going to write. Planning the  
headings is a way of analyzing the information you have, grouping it  
well, and putting it in an order that is logical for your site visitors.

Choose a good heading style\: questions, statements, verb phrases.  
Use nouns and noun phrases sparingly.  
Put your site visitors’ words in the headings.  
Exploit the power of parallelism.  
Use only a few levels of headings.  
Distinguish headings from text.  
Make each level of heading clear.  
Help people jump to content within a web page.  
Evaluate! Read the headings.  
# 1\.  Don’t slap headings into old  
# content  
Going through existing content and putting in a heading every so often  
does not produce good information. Poorly written, arbitrary headings  
may confuse your site visitors instead of helping them.  
Put headings into old content as a first step  
To become familiar with the content you have, go through it, trying to  
write a heading for each paragraph. That can be a useful first step in  
revising.  
•  
If you find it difficult to write a heading for a section of text, it  
probably means the section is not clear or covers too many points  
all jumbled together. Clarify the content. Break it into smaller  
sections.  
•  
If you find yourself writing the same heading over different  
sections of content, it probably means the material is not well  
organized. Reorganize it to be logical for your site visitors.  
Next, list the headings as if they were a table of contents. Do they make  
a good outline? Do they make sense as a whole? Do they flow? Is this  
what site visitors want to know? Are these the key messages you should  
be giving? If not, step back and revise, or even start with a new outline.  
# 2\. Start by outlining  
An outline is just your headings in order. Don’t stress about using Roman  
numerals, letters, or an elaborate numbering scheme. If you just put  
down the headings you are going to use in the order you are going to use  
them, without any text under them, you have an outline.  
Thanks to Caroline Jarrett for  
teaching me this technique of  
putting headings into old content  
as a first step in revision. But as  
Caroline says, “Don’t stop  
there.” 2\. Start by outlining 169  
If you use more than one level, indent a bit for the second level of your  
outline. You’ll see the pattern you are creating.  
Figure 9-3 shows the outline for the web content in Case Study 7-1  
about the International Aviation Art Contest.  
Figure 9-3 The outline for a web topic  
I’m now adding to the advice that I gave in Chapter 7, Checklist 7-1.  
There, I suggested starting by writing the questions that people ask  
and then putting those questions into an order that will make sense  
to your site visitors. What do you then do with the questions  
you’ve listed?  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Sometimes, you’ll keep those questions as your outline, and,  
­ therefore, your headings.  
Sometimes, you’ll decide that questions aren’t the best headings for  
your material. You may turn the questions into statements \(key  
messages\).  
If you find you have all “How do I…?” questions, turn them into  
action phrases with verbs \(“Do x” or “Doing x”\).  
And sometimes, if you are just labeling parts, it’s okay to use nouns  
as headings. 170 Chapter 9 • Including Useful Headings  
Let’s explore when, why, and how to use each of these types of headings\:  
questions, statements, verbs, nouns.  
# 3\.  Choose a good heading style\:  
# Questions, statements, verb  
# phrases  
Your three main choices for headings are questions, statements, or verb  
phrases \(calls to action\).  
# Questions as headings  
When you write questions as headings, you play out both sides of the  
conversation. You put the site visitor on the page with you – the site  
visitor asks the question; you answer it.  
As I said in Chapter 1, I’m not suggesting that you make your entire site  
one big section of frequently asked questions \(FAQs\). Site visitors might  
never find their specific question. I am suggesting questions and  
answers \(Q&A\) as an appropriate writing style for the main content on  
each specific topic.  
Questions make very useful headings in all these different types of web  
content\:  
•  
articles  
•  
•  
•  
blogs  
explanations  
handbooks  
•  
introductions to manuals  
•  
•  
•  
•  
policies  
press releases  
regulations  
troubleshooting information  
Using Q&A can draw people into a web page. For example, seeing the  
question, “Why immunize?” on the web site of the U.S. Centers for  
If your site has both a main page  
of content on a topic and a  
separate page of FAQs on the  
same topic, think about whether  
you really need both.  
Did the team have to write the  
FAQ page because the content on  
the main page wasn’t satisfying  
site visitors’ conversations? If so,  
you probably don’t need both.  
But don’t get rid of the FAQs!  
Take away the other page. Use or  
rewrite the FAQ page as the main  
page of content on that topic and  
don’t call it FAQs. 9\. Make each level of heading clear 183  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Don’t make bold versus color the only difference between heading  
levels. People have a hard time figuring out whether bold is more  
important than color or vice versa.  
Avoid italics. They are not as effective as bold to indicate a heading.  
Italics don’t stand out enough on the screen.  
Underline a heading only if it is a link. Most site visitors assume  
that anything that is underlined is a link.  
Avoid ALL CAPITALS for all the reasons we talked about in Chapter 3.  
If you use color for headings, make sure the color is legible against  
the background of your web page. Before you choose a color, reread  
the section on color-blindness in Chapter 3.  
# 9\.  Make each level of heading clear  
To help site visitors, you must distinguish headings from text and also  
make the hierarchy of the headings \(the different levels\) obvious. Good  
ways to differentiate levels include size, spacing, and placement.  
•  
Size. We all associate size with hierarchy – bigger is more ­ important.  
Type size for the headline \<H1\> should be bigger than for the  
headings \<H2\>. If you use \<H3\> headings and don’t change the  
placement, make them smaller than your \<H2\> headings.  
–  
Make sure the size difference is obvious – but not too huge.  
About three points difference is often good – making the headline  
about 150% of the text size and the headings about 125% of the  
text size. Less difference may be too subtle; much more may  
waste too much precious screen space.  
•  
•  
Spacing. The headline might also have more space after it than other  
headings. \(Look back at the discussion around Figures 3-12 and 3-13  
for why it’s critical to put headings close to the text they introduce.\)  
Placement. You can indent a level of headings. Or you can use bold or  
colored run-in text \(not tagged as a heading\) – as in this bulleted list.  
While we are discussing design for headings, let me add three more  
really important guidelines\:  
•  
•  
Don’t center headlines or headings. If people are scanning down the  
left margin of the content, they’ll miss the centered headings.  
If they go to the centered headings, their eyes will want to keep  
going to the right instead of back to the left margin of the text.  
Put lines \(rules\) over, not under. You don’t need lines with headings, but  
if you use them, consider putting them over \(not under\) the headings.  
Lines under push the eyes up into the previous block of text. Lines  
over help to put each heading together with the text it covers.  
This guideline focuses on  
information design. It connects  
back to Chapter 3. Designers,  
content strategists, and web  
writers must collaborate to get  
designs that make headlines and  
headings truly usable to site  
visitors. 186 Chapter 9 • Including Useful Headings  
# 11\. Evaluate! Read the headings  
How do you know that you have good headings? Of course, the best way  
is to do usability testing. Before you do that, however, you can do this  
review yourself\:  
1.  
Review your plan for the content.  
•  
What do you want to happen because you wrote this content?  
•  
Who are you in a conversation with? Which persona\(s\) is this  
content for?  
•  
What conversation did the persona start with the web site that  
brought that person to this content?  
2.  
As that persona, read the headline and the headings without any of  
the text under the headings.  
3\. Answer these questions\:  
•  
Do you \(“channeling” the persona\) understand what each heading  
means by itself?  
•  
Do the headings tell a coherent story? Do they flow logically from  
one to the next?  
•  
Do the headings successfully give you a “big picture”? Can you  
get the gist of the information on the topic?  
•  
If you wanted only some of the information, is it clear where you  
would go for the specific information you wanted?  
If you answer “no” as your persona to any of these questions, the  
headings are not working well. You may need better headings. You may  
need to rethink, reorganize, and rewrite the content.

# Your  
# Sentences  
Now, let’s work on writing the paragraphs, sentences, and words of your  
web content.  
As part of your content strategy, you must decide on the tone, voice, and  
style for your web messages, always remembering the key message of  
this book\: content = conversation.  
Lists and tables – other good  
ways to tune up your sentences –  
next chapter  
Writing conversationally is not “dumbing down”  
Language changes over time. It always has. Our expectations of  
appropriate style also change over time. They always have.  
Over the past century, the style for communicating useful information  
has become much less formal. And that trend has accelerated greatly  
with the Internet and social media.  
Writing conversationally in plain language with short sentences and  
short words is not dumbing down. It’s communicating clearly. It’s  
respecting your busy site visitors’ time.  
Write so that busy people understand what you are saying the first  
time they read it.  
As you write\:  
•  
Picture the people you are talking with. Which persona\(s\) are you  
conversing with?

Keep photos and short  
descriptions of your personas  
with you as you write. Let them  
join your family on your desk,  
your corkboard, or a corner of  
your screen.  
197 212 Chapter 10 • Tuning up Your Sentences  
# 4\. Write short, simple sentences  
Your busy site visitors have no time to untangle your text. Try to keep  
your sentences to about 10 to 20 words. Cut the fluff. Say it once  
clearly. Keep each sentence to one thought – or two tightly connected  
thoughts.  
If people have to read a sentence  
more than once to understand it,  
rewrite it.  
# Very short sentences are okay, too  
Sentences do not need even 10 words to be meaningful and sharp. If  
you write in questions and answers, a short answer may be all that  
people need.  
Writing very short messages in social media  
Twitter limits us to 140 characters. SMS allows us only 20 more than  
that. Texting on a smart phone or other mobile device can stress our  
thumbs. And so we tend to abbreviate, write telegraphically, drop  
some grammar rules.  
That’s fine as long as you \(the sender\) and the people whom you want  
to get the message understand what you are writing and consider the  
style appropriate for the medium. Your content strategy should  
include decisions about abbreviations and telegraphic writing – when  
it’s okay; when it isn’t. You may decide that writing Thx c u soon is  
fine in tweets, SMS, Facebook, Google+, and other social media – but  
that it is not okay in regular web content for a general audience.  
If you are part of an organization, remember your brand. The voice of  
the brand may change slightly in different media, but that may not be  
your individual decision. It’s part of the organization’s content  
strategy.  
# Fragments may also work  
The personality, tone, and style of your site may make sentence  
fragments acceptable to your site visitors even in regular web content.  
Consider the description of a blog in Figure 10-11. The fragments work  
well here. 10\. Use your site visitors’ words 223  
# 10\. Use your site visitors’ words  
Remember you are conversing with your site visitors. Make that the heart  
of your content strategy on every level. Keep it in mind when you decide  
what topics to write about and what to say for each topic. Think  
conversation as you construct paragraphs, sentences, lists, and tables.  
And when you choose words.  
# Write for your site visitors  
You may be saying, “We have special words that have specific meaning  
in our field. We have to use them.” If everyone you are conversing with  
shares your special language, it’s fine to use those words.  
As Sarah Bauer asked when she used the example in Figure 10-14 from  
lululemon.com, “How many non-yoga participants know what  
‘downward-dog’ means?”  
Bauer, It Works For “You”\:  
A  
User-Centric Guideline To  
Product Pages, Smashing  
Magazine, January 10, 2012  
Figure 10-14 www.lululemon.com  
Using special words your site visitors know can appeal to your market.  
Lululemon makes clothes for yoga. It knows its site visitors. It appeals to  
them with their vocabulary \(as well as with features of its clothes, like  
an emergency hair tie on the hoodie’s zipper\).  
# Know your site visitors  
The examples Bauer used in her blog article were of companies that had  
done the research to understand their site visitors – to know the words  
their site visitors use when searching, when buying in other channels,  
when talking about the topics of the site.  
I see the opposite happen\: Writers greatly overestimating how much of  
their company’s internal jargon others know.  
Your site visitors may not know words that are commonplace to you.  
Research shows that people who know a special vocabulary overestimate  
others’ knowledge of those words by about 25% to 30%.  
Lydia Hooke showed this for a  
government regulation in the  
1970s. More recently, see Hayes  
and Bayzek, 2008. 224 Chapter 10 • Tuning up Your Sentences

 A lawyer in one specialty may not know the words that are common  
in another specialty. And people coming to the web for information  
about wills or leases are probably not lawyers.  
 A doctor in one specialty may not know the words that are common  
in another specialty. And many health care workers are not doctors.  
Most patients are not doctors.  
 Your site visitors may come from all over the world. Many are not  
native speakers of the language of your site.  
 Even in your country, your site visitors may include many people who  
are there temporarily or new to the country. They may not be fluent  
in your site’s language.  
You should offer your content in  
many languages and in culturally  
appropriate ways for your  
diverse site visitors. Localizing  
web sites and apps is an  
important topic, but it is beyond  
the scope of this book.  
# And always use plain language  
Lots of words aren’t technical terms or specific words that will help  
market to your site visitors. They’re just big words that take everyone  
longer to read and understand.  
You can often find a short, simple word that makes your content more  
conversational. Try it. Start with my list and add your own examples of  
long, less-common words that you can replace with short, simple words.  
Instead of this Try this  
ascertain find out  
Instead of this Try this  
obtain get  
attempt try

compensation pay  
purchase buy  
component part  
request ask for  
inception start  
subsequent next  
initiate begin  
terminate end  
inquire ask  
utilize use  
As I said at the beginning of the chapter, using these short, simple  
words is not “dumbing down” your content. It’s respecting your busy site  
visitors’ time.  
And here’s the research that supports this point\: Plain language helps  
both low-literacy and high-literacy site visitors.  
Kathryn Summers and her team worked on a web site for a medicine  
that millions of people take. They tested the web site with both Summarizing Chapter 10 225  
low-literacy and high-literacy web users. They then revised the site to  
resolve the problems the low-literacy web users had.  
\(Those problems were not only the words. Summers and her team also  
used many of the other guidelines for good web writing. They reorganized  
into a clear, logical, flowing story. They shortened paragraphs and  
sentences. They turned paragraphs into bulleted lists. And they always  
used the shortest, simplest, plainest word that had the right meaning.\)  
Then they tested the new site with both low-literacy and high-literacy  
web users.  
Conclusion\: As you see in the tables in Figure 10-15, the plain language  
changes helped low-literacy site visitors get what they needed faster and  
more accurately. And those same changes helped high-literacy site visitors  
even more!!  
Figure 10-15 Revising by following plain language guidelines improved this web site for both  
low-literacy and high-literacy web users.

High-literacy readers are likely to be the busiest and least patient of your  
site visitors. Respect their time by using plain language.

When you are writing web content, remember that if you set the patterns  
clearly and follow them well, your patterns can help people. Parallelism –  
starting each list item the same way – is an excellent pattern to create  
and follow.  
# 6\. Format lists well  
Information design – the way you present information on the screen –  
can also help or hinder people from finding what they need easily.  
Information design applies to lists \(and tables\) as well as to all other  
features of typography and layout.  
When designing lists, you want people to connect the list with its  
introduction, see at a glance that you are giving a list, and find each list  
item easily. Four keys to formatting lists well\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Reduce space between the introduction and the list.  
Put a space between long list items.  
Wrap lines under each other, not under the bullet.  
Put what happens on a line by itself.  
# Reduce space between the introduction  
# and the list  
Plain vanilla HTML puts a line of space between the text before a  
list and the first item in the list. To help people visually group the  
introduction with the list, reduce that space through a cascading  
style sheet \(CSS\). In this book, we use 12 points between paragraphs  
but only 6 points between the introduction to a list and the first  
list item.  
# Put space between long list items  
Single spacing works for lists with short items. However, you need more  
space between items for numbered lists \(where each item is usually a  
full sentence\) and for bulleted lists where each item is more than a  
line long.  
# Wrap lines under each other  
To make your lists look and work as lists, the bullets or numbers have to  
stand out. If the text wraps back to the beginning of the line \(under the  
bullet or number\), each list item looks like a paragraph with a funny  
symbol at the beginning. It doesn’t look like a list. 4\. Think carefully about the first column 245  
Tables answer questions. You don’t have to use the question as a  
heading. You don’t have to have the question anywhere in your  
table. But thinking about the conversation site visitors come  
with and the question\(s\) that the table answers can help you set up  
the table.  
# 4\.  Think carefully about the first  
# column  
Whenever the answer to a question is “it depends,” think “table.” What  
the answer depends on becomes the first column of the table. The  
answer to the question for each site visitor’s situation becomes the  
second column.  
We read sentences across the page \(left to right in English and many  
other languages, right to left in Arabic and Hebrew\). When we identify  
text as a list, however, we read down the page. When we see a table, we  
scan down the first column to find our situation and then we look across  
that row to get what we need.  
This is another case where the  
principle of “given-new” applies.  
\(Look back at Chapter 10,  
Guideline 8, Case Study 10-4, the  
“yams.”\)  
What if the answer depends on many things?  
If the answer to people’s question is “it depends on many things,”  
you may not want to create a table. The table might have to be too  
complex for most web users or too large to fit well on the web page –  
and certainly to fit well on a mobile.  
For example, the answer to “How much does a new laptop cost?” may  
be “It depends on how much memory you want it to have, what size  
screen you want, how fast you want it to run, what weight you are  
willing to carry, and so on.”  
For complex situations, consider asking site visitors a series of  
questions or giving them filters to apply to their choices rather than  
putting all the information in one table.  
Case Study 11-2, about shipping costs, is relevant to every e-commerce  
site. It’s also a great case for letting go of words, for the difference  
between a bulleted list and a table, and for handling multiple situations  
at the same time. 248 Chapter 11 • Using Lists and Tables  
# 5\. Keep tables simple  
Two-column tables are best both for space and ease of use. Sometimes,  
however, you have more than two related pieces of information to give  
people for each row of a table. How large can a table be before it  
becomes too much for site visitors?  
# How many columns?  
Use only as many columns as your site visitors will be able to see all at  
once on whatever screen they are using. If all your information pieces  
are small, you may be able to fit three or even four columns in your table  
and still have people see it even on their mobiles.  
Consider web constraints  
The web constrains us much more than paper did.  
•  
•  
•  
No fold-outs. You can’t create fold-out pages the way some old paper  
reports did.  
No horizontal scrolling. One of the strongest findings from usability  
testing is how few people notice a horizontal scroll bar.  
Small screens. You cannot assume that all your site visitors  
have large monitors with maximized windows. If your app or site  
is likely to be viewed on a mobile device, you know you need to  
keep your tables small. But even if all your site visitors are at  
desktop computers, they may still have smaller monitors than  
the one you are working on. They may magnify what they can see  
so they are not using your default resolution. They may keep  
many windows open and not use the entire screen for your site.  
Consider breaking up large and complicated tables into a series of  
smaller, more specific tables. Or layer your tables – allowing your site  
visitors to drill down to more details through links in the table.  
Consider site visitors’ conversations  
The example about renting an RV back in Figure 11-16 combines size of  
vehicle, cost, number of days, and season all in one table – a lot of  
information. Yet, it may work because people are primarily using it for  
comparison. They actually want all that information.  
The example in the case study is different. When they come to the  
Shipping Charges table, site visitors know where they want the package  
to be sent. Information for any other geographic location is not relevant  
and would only get in the way of their finding what they need. 6\. Format tables well 249  
That’s why I would use links to take people to the small table that is  
relevant to the location they want. Having small, specific tables for  
shipping is easier for most people than a large matrix with information  
for different people in different columns. People have difficulty jumping  
over columns that are not relevant to them.  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
Research shows that older adults are less able to quickly  
suppress nonrelevant information than younger people are.  
As we age, our ability to sort relevant from nonrelevant  
seems to decrease.  
Gazzaley, 2009  
# How many rows?  
Although most site visitors scroll vertically today, a long table may be  
more difficult to use than a long list. A table shows relationships. Your  
site visitors must remember the column headings for a table to  
understand how the pieces of information in each row relate to each  
other.  
Break very long tables into a series of smaller tables that allow  
you to keep the context-giving column headings close to the  
information.

# ACCESS  
For information on how to construct and tag a table so that  
screen-readers can work with it\: http\://webaim.org/

# 6\. Format tables well  
Information design applies to tables, too – as it does to all parts of all  
your web content.  
# Reduce lines\: Help people focus on  
# information  
People use tables to see relationships along a row. Thick lines between  
columns stop people from moving easily along the row – just the  
opposite of what you want people to do.  
Also, heavy lines draw people’s eyes. You want your site visitors to focus  
on the essential information in the table, not on the lines between the  
pieces of information. Don’t make each cell of a table into a box with  
thick, equal-weight borders all around it. Summarizing Chapter 11 251

Make unvisited and visited links obvious.  
–  
Use your link colors only for links.  
–  
Show visited links by changing the color. 280 Chapter 13 • Using Illustrations Effectively  
Think about what the photo is saying  
Even mood pictures are part of the conversation. They send messages.  
For example, pictures of people send messages about “you’ll fit in here”  
or \(often inadvertently\) “you won’t fit in here.”  
Mood pictures help set the tone of the conversation. Often, their role is  
to say “feel good about us” \(sort of like asking people to “like this” on  
Facebook\). They can support your brand adjectives and brand messages\:  
“We’re trustworthy; bank with us.” “We’re a cool place; shop here  
often.”  
Always ask yourself what messages different people are likely to take  
from your mood pictures. For example, compare the banner in  
Figure 13-11 from a different university with the one in Figure 13-9  
that you just saw from City College of New York. Which picture makes  
you more interested in the university whose site they come from?  
Figure 13-11 Is it clear what message this is sending? Does it entice you to that university? Pictures  
of buildings usually don’t bring out the same warm and fuzzy feelings as pictures of people.

# Seven guidelines for using  
# illustrations effectively  
For all five types of illustrations, keep these guidelines in mind\:  
1\. Don’t make people wonder what or why.  
2\. Choose an appropriate size.  
3\. Show diversity.  
4\. Don’t make content look like ads.  
5\. Don’t annoy your site visitors with blinking, rolling, waving,  
or wandering text or pictures.  
6\. Use animation only where it helps.  
7\. Make illustrations accessible.  
In the first edition, I also had the  
guideline, don’t make people  
wait through splash or Flash. The  
guideline is still critical, but I’m  
happy to say that most people  
have learned it. The example  
I used in the first edition,  
www.freehearingtest.com, hasn’t  
changed. But with that exception,  
I see almost no “you must wait  
through this” Flash introductions  
anymore. 3\. Show diversity 283  
For example, the Boys & Girls Club of America \(BGCA\) has a mission “to  
enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their  
full potential.…” And they show that with real alumni in Figure 13-14.  
Figure 13-14 Boys & Girls Club of America.

Diversity is obvious from this picture of people who really participated in the  
# Test! Test! Test!  
You may be surprised by the messages people take from your pictures.  
Tom Brinck shared a story with me of his experience trying to develop  
the visual strategy for an organization\:  
The organization wanted to recruit more minorities and women than it  
had. So it showed a diverse group as employees. But that was their hope  
for the future, not their present reality. And potential hires knew that. In  
usability testing, when the photos had half or more women in the group,  
women laughed and said something was wrong. They knew there weren’t  
that many women in the organization. In an effort to show equality, the  
web designers had created a mismatch with current reality that seemed  
misleading to the very people the organization was trying to recruit.  
Tom’s story shows the value of usability testing. For all mood pictures,  
especially pictures of people, it’s very difficult to predict site visitors’  
reactions.  
Another story, this time from my own work\:  
I was doing a usability test of a site for a group that does medical research.  
The home page had two pictures of scientists, a young woman concentrating  
as she looked into a modern microscope and a man with a white coat and a 286 Chapter 13 • Using Illustrations Effectively

The only good reason to animate graphics is if it helps explain the  
content. For example, animation can be very useful to walk someone  
through a process.  
Today, video is the most common technique for animation. But  
situations still exist where a nonvideo animation works best. For  
example, Animated Knots by Grog uses motion and text together very  
well to show how to tie many different knots \(Figure 13-17\).  
The web site also offers a video.  
Both mobile app and web site use  
clear and colorful icons with  
words for navigation.  
Figure 13-17 The first four of seven steps in tying a square knot. You can watch the  
animation all at once, or you can move through it step by step. Each step also makes a bit  
more of the text dark – so you can follow the steps in text as well as pictures.

# 7\. Make illustrations accessible  
AAA  
# ACCESS  
For people who use screen-readers, you must annotate  
illustrations so the assistive software can describe them. You  
do that by writing “alternative” text with the ALT attribute to  
an image \<IMG\> tag. I’m going to call that ALT-text.  
# Make ALT-text meaningful  
If the illustration is meant to convey substantive information, be sure to  
convey that information in the ALT-text, too. If the illustration is a mood  
picture, your ALT-text should describe what is in the picture – focusing  
on the elements that create the emotional response you expect.  
To write good ALT-text, you must know why you are using the  
illustration. I hope that working through the different purposes for Summarizing Chapter 13 287  
illustrations in this chapter has helped you think about what you are  
putting on your site.  
To test whether you have a good description for each illustration, the  
World Wide Web Consortium accessibility guidelines suggest that you  
imagine reading the web page aloud over the telephone. What would you  
say about the image to make your listeners understand it?

# Draft to Final  
Writing is a process that goes beyond a first draft. You may do it all  
­ yourself, but it’s better if you include other people.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Think of writing as revising with yourself as your own first editor.  
Read as you write. Read before you send or post. If you can, let your  
writing rest. Then, read it again. Read it out loud. Use the spell  
checker, dictionaries, handbooks, and style guides. Edit, revise, and  
proofread. Also, check your links. Check your facts.  
If you have colleagues, share drafts and help each other. You can  
also use a spouse, partner, in-law, or friend as your colleague. Two  
sets of eyes are always better than one.  
By yourself, with your colleagues, or with a usability specialist, walk  
your personas through their conversations.  
You may be lucky enough to have an expert editor to help you,  
especially for blog posts or longer pieces of content.  
Technical, legal, or policy specialists may have to review your content  
before it gets posted. You may have to negotiate what you may say and  
how you may say it. You can make those reviews positive experiences.  
This chapter has guidelines and tips for all five of these situations.  
First draft ≠ final draft  
The best writing comes from  
revising.  
# Read, edit, revise, proofread  
# your own work  
Let’s explore these guidelines for helping yourself\:

# Letting Go of the Words. DOI\: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385930-3.00014-5  
© 2012 Redish and Associates, Published by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.  
289 Read, edit, revise, proofread your own work 291  
As you read what you wrote, ask yourself\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Does it really say what I want to say?  
Would someone else take the same meaning from it that I do?  
Does it fit with my other writing? Does it fit with other content on the  
web site?  
Is my tone right for the situation?  
Is it as clear and concise as I can say it?  
Will my readers know all the words I am using? \(If not, must I use  
words that will be new to my readers? Have I explained new words  
and concepts clearly?\)  
Are the sentences grammatical? Are the words spelled correctly? \(If  
you are writing for social media where telegraphic words are okay,  
you still need to ask\: Am I using spelling that is going to make sense  
to my readers?\)  
# Check your links  
If your content includes links, click on each one. Make sure the link  
leads to a page with the same words you used in the link – or at least  
something similar enough to reassure your site visitors.  
And remember not to rely only on  
Click here for your links.  
# Check your facts  
Make sure what you say is accurate. How do you know the sources you  
used are credible?  
For example, Wikipedia and other “pedias” are great resources – but  
open community writing and editing doesn’t guarantee accuracy. Search  
engines may give preference to sites that other sites link to, but that  
measure of “success” or “trust” doesn’t guarantee accuracy. Even  
reading the same information over and over on different sites does not  
make that information true. The sites could all be copying each other or  
the same original site.  
When considering the credibility of what you read online, ask questions  
like these\:  
•  
•  
Do the facts make a consistent whole, or does information in one  
place contradict information in another place?  
Is the source a respected authority on the topic?  
–  
Government\: Are they an impartial, research-based, data-gathering,  
and data-delivering group, or are they politically biased? 292 Chapter 14 • Getting from Draft to Final  
•  
•  
–  
–  
Nonprofit\: Are they nonpartisan and nonpartial, or are they  
pushing an agenda?  
Commercial\: Are they being even-handed, or are they slanting  
information to market their product?  
Does the article name the author? What can you learn about that  
author?  
Does the content have a date so that you can tell when the  
information was written?  
Many sites now include dates and authorship or ownership – information  
they can publish from their content management system. For example,  
Figure 14-1 shows this information from a typical page at the web site  
of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\).  
Figure 14-1 You can increase people’s sense of trust by showing how up-to-date the  
information is and who is responsible for the information.  
www.cdc.gov  
Remember also that you can still check facts offline. Find a person  
who knows and check the facts with that person. Use books. But keep  
in mind that just because it is in print \(offline or online\) doesn’t make  
it true. Books – even textbooks – sometimes copy errors from each  
other.  
# Let it rest  
Many good recipes require rest time for the food. So does good writing.  
You don’t have to post anything immediately – even a blog entry, a tweet,  
or a comment. I know bloggers who write at lunchtime and post in the  
evening. I often schedule a tweet for a few hours from when I write it so  
I can review it after I’ve been away from it for a bit.  
For web content that is going to last a long time, you should be able to  
put your draft away for a day or two as part of your writing process. 294 Chapter 14 • Getting from Draft to Final  
Part of your content strategy is choosing or writing a style guide. Follow it.  
# Run the spell checker but don’t rely on it  
You know that the spell checker is only checking each word against the  
program’s internal dictionaries.  
•  
•  
If the word is in the dictionary, the spell checker will accept it, even  
if it’s not the right word in the right place. \(If you’ve ever typed  
“now” for “not” or “our” for “out,” you know what I mean.\)  
If the word is not in the dictionary, the spell checker will reject it, even  
if it is the right word in the right place. \(On my own computer, of course,  
I’ve added my name to the dictionary. But if you try it on yours, the spell  
checker will probably want to turn Redish into “reddish” or “radish.”\)  
# Proofread  
Because the spell checker isn’t perfect, you should also proofread what you  
wrote. A good way to do that is to go through what you have written line by  
line from the end of your copy back up to the beginning. That helps you  
look at each word separately and not get caught up in reading for meaning.  
# Share drafts with colleagues  
Successful writers share their work in draft, try their writing out with  
relevant audiences, and revise based on what they learn from their early  
readers. Let’s explore these guidelines for sharing drafts\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Accept and learn from the process.  
Work with colleagues to fit the content strategy.  
Share partial drafts.  
Have someone read it out loud.  
•  
•  
•  
Ask what your key message is.  
Pay attention to comments.  
Put your ego in the drawer, cheerfully.  
# Accept and learn from the process  
Your attitude about sharing drafts is critical. Make it fun. Make it a  
learning experience. I love the way Tom Brinck, creative director and  
usability specialist, puts it\:  
You should delight in feedback and getting your content just right. You  
should enjoy the surprises and discovery when people come from a  
Style guides – Interlude 5 right  
after this chapter  
Read this sentence out loud\:  
Eye kin knot sea ewe.  
Spell checkers would say it is  
fine; but, of course, it is not.  
Check out Tom’s book\: Brinck,  
Gergle, and Wood, Usability for  
the Web\: Designing Web Sites  
that Work Share drafts with colleagues 295  
different perspective and want something you totally didn’t expect. If  
you’re brewing in resentment over having to suppress your supposedly good  
ideas, you’re going to die young of stomach ulcers. Take the opposite  
perspective\: Share your ideas and love what you learn, not as your ideas  
are “shot down,” but as your ideas compete in an ecology of good ideas  
and improve as a result.  
# Work with colleagues to fit the content  
# strategy  
If you are part of an organization, you should also be working with other  
web team members to be sure your content fits the content strategy. Fits =  
appropriate tone, message, style. Fits = good length for the design and the  
medium.  
Remember that the web site represents the organization and not you –  
or others – as individual writers. That’s part of what content strategy is  
all about\: making the site the “voice of the organization.” The content  
strategy may allow you your own voice, especially for blog posts or  
articles that you sign. But for most web content, most of the time, in  
a large organization, site visitors should not be able to tell who wrote  
what.  
# Share partial drafts  
Share one piece or part of a piece to see if you are on the right track  
with message, level of detail, tone, organization, writing style, and so on.  
That could save you lots of time and grief. The earlier you learn what to  
change, the less effort it takes to make the changes. The Internet has  
many options now for sharing drafts.  
# Have someone read it out loud  
Find a few people who are part of the audience you want to reach. Ask  
them to read your web content. Ask them to read out loud. Where they  
hesitate, stumble, or reread\: rewrite!  
# Ask what your key message is  
When they have read your content, don’t ask for their reaction. Ask them  
what message they get.  
# Pay attention to comments  
Use what you hear from sharing early drafts. 296 Chapter 14 • Getting from Draft to Final  
Also pay attention to what you hear after you have published or posted.  
With social media and responder technology now so prevalent on the  
web, you get to hear what others think about your content after as well  
as before you put it up. Learn from the feedback you get. Use it to  
converse even better in the next content you write.  
# Put your ego in the drawer, cheerfully  
If you are writing poetry or fiction, your own blog, or your own site, your  
voice as author is a large part of what you are projecting though your  
web content. That’s fine.  
But if you are part of an organization, it’s not about you as author. It’s  
about communicating so clearly that your site visitors can satisfy their  
own conversations with the site.  
Of course, you should take pride in your work. That pride can be in  
working as a team with colleagues to have a web site that has a  
consistent writing style, tone, vocabulary, and message.  
Don’t get into arguments about what “I” like or what another “I” likes.  
Put your “I” away. Make everyone else put their “I” away. Get out your  
personas. Talk about the conversations your site visitors come to have  
with your content.  
Also put your ego in the drawer when you get feedback. Listen with an  
open mind. Don’t get defensive about your writing.  
You don’t have to act on every suggestion, but consider each with respect.  
# Walk your personas through their  
# conversations  
Throughout this book, I’ve urged you to write every piece of content  
with a specific persona in mind – to imagine the conversation that  
person wants to have with your content. You can also use personas and  
conversations to assess how well the site is doing.  
When I do a persona-based, conversation-based review, I work with the  
web team to understand  
•  
•  
the business goals for the site or app  
the site visitors they hope will use the site or app \(personas\)  
When you start to bristle at  
comments, read the quote from  
Tom Brinck again. •  
the scenarios that will bring those visitors to the site or app  
\(conversations\)  
Then I try to carry through those conversations as if I were the personas.  
When the persona would run into trouble, I turn on my hat as a user  
experience expert and identify the reasons the web site is likely to cause  
problems for people like the persona.  
You can do this for your own content. You can ask a colleague to do it  
with or for you. If you have usability colleagues, get them to do it with or  
for you.  
# Let editors help you  
If you can, take advantage of help from a copy editor \(“details” person\)  
and a developmental editor \(“big picture” person\). You may want  
different people as copy editor and developmental editor. Although  
some people can do both well, the tasks require different skills. If your  
organization doesn’t have editors, you and your colleagues might take  
on these roles for each other.  
# Get help with the details  
Copy editing is looking at the “little picture” – the details of grammar,  
spelling, and punctuation. The best copy editors are very detail-oriented.  
They read your words very carefully.  
Great copy editors are good spellers. They know the conventions of  
grammar and punctuation. If they are part of an organization, they know  
the organization’s style guide.  
It’s almost impossible to catch all the typos in your own work. If at all  
possible, always have someone else copy edit your content.  
# Get help with the big picture  
A developmental editor starts by going over the three planning questions  
from Chapter 2 with you\:  
•  
•  
•  
What are you trying to achieve through this content?  
Who are you conversing with through this content?  
How will those people use what you are writing? What are their  
scenarios, their conversations?  
Let editors help you 297  
http\://redish.net/blog/review-  
your-web-site-through-personas-  
and-conversations  
Also do usability testing –  
Chapter 15. Walking personas  
through conversations is a great  
technique to use even before you  
do usability testing. 298 Chapter 14 • Getting from Draft to Final  
With the answers to those questions, a developmental editor helps you  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
select the content your site visitors need  
make your key messages obvious  
write a good headline  
organize the content logically for your readers  
break up your content with clear headings  
write so your content is easy to scan, read, and use  
write with words your site visitors know  
# Negotiate successful reviews  
# \(and edits\)  
Everything in this section applies to working with editors as well as with  
reviewers. So add “and editors” in your mind as you go through these  
guidelines.  
Your web content may have to go through review with  
•  
•  
•  
•  
managers  
policy analysts  
lawyers  
technical staff  
•  
editorial staff  
•  
web publication staff  
Of course, not all content goes through all those reviews. But if your  
content goes through any of these reviews or if you are one of these  
reviewers, the hints in this section may help make reviewing a good  
experience. Let’s talk about reviewing in three stages\:  
•  
•  
•  
setting up good reviews  
getting useful information from reviewers  
using reviews well  
# Setting up good reviews  
Good reviews start at the beginning of a project – not at the end.  
When you first get an assignment, find out who will review what  
you write. Negotiate successful reviews \(and edits\) 299  
Meet with reviewers at the beginning  
Discuss and agree on  
•  
•  
roles and responsibilities  
the schedule for drafts and reviews  
•  
your plans for the content  
Practice the doctrine of no surprise  
The surest way to get a negative reaction is to shock your reviewers \(or  
your editors\) by showing them something that they do not expect and to  
which they can exclaim, “That’s not the way we write here!”  
Never shock. Always work with people before you deliver a draft so they  
know what to expect. Deal with any concerns they have about style or  
content before you give them content to review.  
Doctrine of no surprise\:  
Work with reviewers before  
giving them a draft so they’ll  
know what to expect.  
Help your reviewers understand good web writing  
When I said just now, “discuss and agree on your plans for the content,”  
I meant making sure your reviewers agree from the beginning on  
•  
•  
•  
•  
purposes\: what you want to achieve through this web content  
personas\: who the content is for  
scenarios, conversations\: what will bring people to your content  
content\: what you plan to cover \(if you have an outline, share it with  
them\)  
If your reviewers don’t think in terms of personas and conversations, this  
might be a great time to introduce both the concepts and your specific  
personas and their conversations.  
If the conversational style that you have worked on throughout this  
book is different from what your reviewers expect, spend the time and  
effort to convince them of how important and useful it is. You are  
welcome to use examples from the book \(with credit, please\). Even  
better, of course, give them a copy of the book with relevant pages  
marked.  
You might create a “before” and “after” example for even a small piece  
of your web content to show reviewers what you will be doing. Get them  
to express their concerns early so you can discuss the concerns and allay  
their fears. 300 Chapter 14 • Getting from Draft to Final  
# Getting useful information from reviewers  
Stay in touch with reviewers, but don’t overdo it.  
Tell reviewers when the schedule changes  
Schedules change. If a change affects when you will get your content to  
reviewers, let them know. Negotiate new dates. Don’t just assume they  
can accommodate every slip in your schedule.  
Give reviewers a “heads up” a few days in advance  
Everyone is overly busy, including your reviewers. Remind them when  
you are about to send a draft.  
Make your expectations clear  
It’s frustrating to expect a technical review and then get your draft back  
with nothing more than a few commas changed. Improve your chances  
of getting what you need by making your expectations clear.  
Deliver your draft for review with individual cover emails. Tell each reviewer  
•  
•  
•  
•  
what stage the draft is at  
what specific help you need from that reviewer  
when you must have the review back  
to call or write if he or she has questions or needs to renegotiate  
dates  
And remind reviewers politely that you expect them to comment and  
suggest, not to rewrite. Writing the content is your job.  
If you have specific needs, let reviewers know  
In your cover email, remind each reviewer of that reviewer’s role \(policy,  
technical, legal, etc.\). In addition, you may have specific questions for a  
reviewer. Develop a way of asking that makes it obvious you have a  
question and who that question is for. I often use square brackets \[ \],  
put the reviewer’s name in bold, and use a color so that it stands out on  
the screen, as in this example\:  
\[Jim\: Please tell me who is responsible for approving travel requests. I want  
to turn the passive sentence in the original into an active sentence here.  
Please fill in the blank for me at the beginning of my sentence. Thanks.\]  
If you use a different color for each reviewer, they can each quickly find  
what they should answer.  
Thanks to Ahava Leibtag for the  
suggestion of different colors for  
different reviewers. Negotiate successful reviews \(and edits\) 301  
# Using reviews well  
When you get reviews back, read them carefully and with an open mind.  
Don’t get defensive  
Reading reviews is another good time to put your ego in the drawer. Be  
open to reviewers’ comments. You don’t have to agree with all of them.  
You may not have to – or be able to – make all the changes every reviewer  
wants. But you must consider them all respectfully.  
Don’t automatically accept changes  
If you get conflicting comments on facts, find out what the real story is. If  
you are not sure that a change is correct, do the research to find out. If  
you get conflicting comments on style, work to resolve the differences –  
or to convince reviewers that your style is best for your site visitors.  
Rewrite to avoid misunderstandings  
If a reviewer misunderstood something you wrote, you may not have stated it  
as clearly as you could. Try again. And run that piece by the reviewer again.  
Persuade  
If the reviews that trouble you are based on different perceptions of purpose,  
personas, conversations, or appropriate style, you may need to evangelize  
clear writing. Within the constraints of your organization’s culture, push for  
clear web writing even for legal and technical information. Your site visitors  
need you to do this for them. I hope the guidelines, explanations, and  
examples in this book not only persuade and mentor you, but also prove  
useful to you in persuading and mentoring others.  
Negotiate  
The teamwork that creates successful web sites often involves  
compromise. Work with reviewers to put accurate, reliable, and clear  
information on your web site. Remember that even legal information  
can be accurate, sufficient, and also clear and easy to understand.  
Communicate  
Reviewers who feel that you ignored their comments are less likely to  
give your content a thorough review on the next round. Keep a summary  
of the changes you make and do not make, especially for legal, policy,  
and technical reviewers. If you have several rounds of review, include  
the summary from the previous round. Your reviewers need clear  
communication just as your site visitors do. And your explanations can  
help educate your reviewers about clear writing.

# Test!  
# Test!  
I urge you to adopt the mantra\: “Test! Test! Test!” Usability testing is  
that important.  
Any time you have someone try to use what you’ve developed you are  
doing usability testing. If you ask someone to read your web content out  
loud and tell you what it means, you are doing a usability test. If you  
have someone try to find information on your web site and have them  
think out loud while doing it, you are doing a usability test.  
# Why do usability testing?  
Almost all usability testing that web teams do now is “formative” testing –  
having site visitors \(or people you would like to be site visitors\) try out the  
web site or app before you launch it. The purpose is diagnostic. You want  
to see what is working well and what is not working well, so you can fix  
what is not working well before you launch.  
You must do usability testing because  
•  
•  
you are almost certainly not typical of your site visitors  
what matters is what works for the site visitors – not what different  
members of the web team want or think is best  
•  
•  
by watching a few people struggle, you save many people from pain,  
frustration, and failure  
the earlier you find what’s not working, the easier and less expensive

A few words about words  
The people who come to help you in a usability test are  
“participants.” Don’t call them “subjects.” You’re not doing a  
psychology experiment or a medical study.  
Be careful how you talk about “test.” You are not doing “user testing” –  
that would be testing the users. You are doing “usability testing” where  
the participants test the site or app.  
Don’t say, “We want to test how well people can use the site.” That  
blames problems on the users. Say, “We want to know how the site  
works for people like you.” That puts the burden on the site.  
What you learn in a usability test can help you change the site or app.  
You cannot change the users.  
Although I use the words “usability testing” when I’m talking to  
colleagues, I never say “testing” or even “evaluation” to participants.  
I ask people to come “try out the site.” When they are with me, I tell  
them that they’ll be “working with” a particular site. That’s much  
better than trying to convince them that you are not testing them after  
you’ve used the words “usability testing.”  
# What’s needed for usability testing  
Usability testing has many variations, but all usability tests share these  
six attributes\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Real issues. You have thought about what you want to learn and  
planned the test to give you answers to your questions.  
Real people. Participants represent \(at least some of\) the site visitors  
or app users you want.  
Real tasks. The stories \(scenarios, conversations\) you have them try  
out with the web site or app are ones that they really want to do or  
that are realistic to them.  
Real data. You watch, listen, ask neutral questions, and take notes  
as they work. \(In remote unmoderated tests, you may get only what  
they did – clickstream data – without hearing why or being able to  
ask questions.\) What’s not needed for usability testing 309  
•  
•  
Real insights. You put away your assumptions and biases as you  
review the data. You see what is working well and what is not.  
Real changes. You use what you learned. You keep what is working  
well and improve what could be better.  
# What’s not needed for usability  
# testing  
You don’t need\:  
•  
•  
Finished product. Don’t wait until your product is finished. Test early.  
Test often. Test your current site or app before you revise it. Test  
with paper prototypes. Be informal. Just do it.  
Special space. If you have a usability lab, great! But it’s not  
necessary. Test in someone’s cubicle, workers’ break room,  
participants’ homes, at a conference where the people you want to  
work with gather, or in a conference room – as in Figure 15-1.

•  
Special software. It’s great if you have it. Several excellent programs  
are available to capture what is happening and to allow you to take 310 Chapter 15 • Test! Test! Test!  
•  
•  
•  
notes. But they are not necessary. When I’m sitting next to a  
participant, I still use paper and pencil – even if I have a note-taker  
using software in another room.  
Videotape. The most common use of videotape is to convince people  
who don’t yet believe in usability testing or who think that only  
stupid users have problems. Seeing is believing. If you can’t get  
people to come observe the test in person \(which they should!\) –  
or if you don’t have space and have too many observers – then,  
yes, videotape the sessions. But don’t assume you’ll do detailed  
data analysis from the tapes. In most schedules, there’s no time  
for that.  
A formal test report \(maybe\). What you need as a report depends on  
the type of usability testing you are doing and on your organization’s  
or client’s culture and process. You may only need a quick list of  
findings and recommendations that everyone agrees on.  
Participants to come to you. You save time and can schedule more  
sessions if participants all come to the same place, but it’s not  
necessary. You can test remotely with you in one place, the  
participant in another, and observers each at their own location. If  
you go to people’s work places or their homes, you also get to see  
their web setups as well as their physical and social environments.  
So, don’t let “people don’t have time to come to do a usability test  
with us” stop you.  
# How do we do a usability test?  
No matter what variation you use, every usability test – like other user  
research projects – goes through five phases\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
planning  
conducting  
analyzing  
reporting  
using the results  
In the following sections, I summarize several ways to do usability testing.  
# What most people do  
Formative testing. Small-scale. Five to 15 people, one at a time. Each  
session is about one hour. The participant works with the site or app while  
an experienced facilitator sits with the person \(or in an adjacent room\).  
If you have not yet done usability  
testing, learn how from these  
excellent resources\: Barnum,  
2011; Krug, 2010; Rubin and  
Chisnell, 2008;  
www.usability.gov What variations might we consider? 311  
Here’s what typically happens in a usability test session\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The facilitator starts with a few questions to learn more about the  
participant and to make the participant comfortable.  
Then the participant tries to complete tasks \(conversations,  
scenarios\) with the site or app while thinking out loud.  
At the end, the facilitator asks a few more questions to get the  
participant’s reaction to the site and to cover any specific issues  
\(such as understanding of specific words on the site\).  
Some groups use a formal rating-scale questionnaire at the end.  
You can do this with or without video- and audiotaping. Someone should  
definitely take notes, but it can be with a specialized software program,  
word processing, or even on paper. Everyone connected to the project  
should observe either in person or remotely.  
The level of analysis, reporting, and recommendations vary widely.  
# Even quicker\: “A morning a month”  
Formative testing. Three people. An hour each. One morning during the  
month. Teams should commit to doing testing this way every month on a  
regular schedule. Each month, the team selects specific issues to focus  
on and promises to act right away on the top insights from that month’s  
testing. Each session follows the same pattern as in the previous  
description of “what most people do.” Team members should observe  
the testing because everyone who observed \(and only those who did\)  
come together immediately after the three sessions to review insights  
and agree on changes. Brief write-up on agreement about insights and  
fixes. No formal report.  
AAA  
ACCESS Include people with special needs in your usability test to be  
sure that the site or app works for them.  
# What variations might we consider?  
You can test

remotely, with a facilitator  
remotely, without a facilitator  
around the globe  
in a group setting  
by fielding alternatives \(A/B testing\)  
An interesting look at what  
different groups do for reports  
from formative usability testing\:  
Theofanos and Quesenbery, 2005  
\(Although this paper dates from  
several years ago, the  
information in it is still what  
people do.\)  
“A morning a month” is the  
method in Krug, 2010.

working with seniors in usability  
testing – resources at http\://

# Remotely, with a facilitator  
You can do remote, facilitated tests with either method that I just  
described. The only difference is that people are not all in the same  
physical place. You use collaboration software to pass control of the  
screen from facilitator to participant and back again. You listen and talk  
either through the computer program or through a telephone connection.  
Observers can join from anywhere.  
Working remotely greatly expands the reach of your testing. You can  
recruit the best participants no matter where they are. You can gain  
diversity among your participants without travel expenses.  
# Remotely, without a facilitator  
With unmoderated testing, you trade the richness of think aloud for  
quantitative results from many people. Unmoderated testing may work  
well to know if people can find a specific piece of information. It’s not  
the best technique for testing content when you want to know if the site  
has the content people need or if they understand the content \(beyond  
finding a specific fact\).  
# Testing around the globe  
Context matters. Culture matters. Language matters. If your web site is  
global, you should be sensitive to cultural differences. If you can, do  
usability testing in many contexts, cultures, and languages. You can do  
that either with local facilitators in different countries or remotely from  
one country to another.  
Before you do any user-centered activities outside your own culture,  
educate yourself about working globally.  
# Testing in a group setting  
In a typical usability test, the same facilitator holds individual sessions  
one after the other. And there’s value in the continuity and consistency  
of having the same person interact with all the participants. But if you  
can’t afford the time, you might do simultaneous sessions.  
Hal Shubin of Interaction Design, Inc. \(www.user.com\) shared this story\:  
The client needed quick feedback. Hal got four laptops, four participants,  
and four facilitators \(himself and three quickly-trained people from the  
client’s web team\). They did four one-on-one sessions at the same time  
around the dining room table of one of the facilitators. Then, all eight  
Many vendors now offer tools for  
unmoderated usability testing.  
For a good article on the pros  
and cons of unmoderated testing  
with a list of vendors – Soucy,  
2010  
Barnum, 2010, has a running  
case study of testing the Chinese  
version of a hotel web site.  
Other resources\:  
Quesenbery and Szuc, 2011, on  
how UX practitioners work  
globally  
Dray and Siegel, 2005, on many  
aspects and cautions for  
international UX work Why not just do focus groups? 313  
people – participants and facilitators – gathered in the living room to  
discuss what happened during the test sessions. Hal says the client  
learned a lot about how their customers use the web site and got good  
ideas about what needed to be done – all in one evening. It helped, of  
course, that the participants they selected were comfortable working in  
the same room and being together in the discussion afterwards.  
# Fielding alternatives \(A/B testing\)  
Today, a common way to find out what works best with actual users is to  
launch different versions of content and see which does best in the  
marketplace. This is called A/B testing; although, of course, you could  
compare A, B, C, D, or more versions.  
In A/B testing, “best” is the version that achieves a measurable goal\:  
more sales, more completed forms, more pages looked at, and so on.  
Because conversion rates \(getting people to click on an ad and then to  
complete a transaction\) is so important to e-commerce companies, most  
now routinely use A/B testing.  
A/B testing gives you real-world data. If you change only very specific  
aspects of the site, you know what made the difference. However, with  
A/B testing, you don’t know why. Without listening to people, you don’t  
know what about the change made it work \(or not work\). It may be hard  
to generalize from the results.  
Check out http\://whichtestwon  
.com. Each week, you get to see  
the results of a different real A/B  
test – and you get to match your  
guess about what happened in  
the test against other people’s  
guesses and the actual results.  
# Why not just do focus groups?  
If your web team is part of a marketing department or you are in an  
agency that works primarily with marketing departments, you may hear,  
“we do usability testing; we get people together in a focus group.”  
A focus group is not the same as usability testing. They are different  
techniques that get you different information. Table 15-1 shows several  
points of difference.  
# What does a focus group need?  
A well-run focus group is  
•  
•  
•  
planned carefully with a prepared script and questions to ask  
facilitated by a trained person who can draw out the shy people and  
keep the overeager people from dominating the discussion  
allowed to stray from the script along interesting and relevant lines  
but kept within bounds so you get the information you need 314 Chapter 15 • Test! Test! Test!  
Table 15-1 A focus group is different from a usability test  
People Focus Group Usability Test  
8– 10 at a time 1 at a time  
Time usually 2 hours 1 hour or less  
Activity talk; a group discussion  
where people react to what  
they are shown or asked  
behavior, people actually use the  
site; usually also a brief individual  
interview without the influence of  
other group members  
Good for getting people’s opinions,  
attitudes, desires, self-report  
seeing how people actually do tasks;  
watching people interact with the  
site or app  
Best time  
to do  
only very early in the design  
process  
iteratively, throughout the process  
from testing old site or app before  
revising, to paper prototypes, to  
working prototypes, to final site  
# Why isn’t a focus group the best  
# technique?  
Focus groups are not the best technique for understanding how a web  
site or mobile app works for site visitors for two major reasons\:  
•  
•  
Group dynamics. One person can trigger others agreeing to something  
they might not otherwise say. Even with a great facilitator, some  
people may not express their true feelings in the group setting.  
Difference between talk and action. What people say they do is often  
not what they actually do. People are not very good at imagining  
their own behavior. They have to actually put their hands on and  
“do” to realize when and how something will or won’t work for them.  
# Can we combine usability testing and  
# focus groups?  
If you need to, you can combine aspects of usability testing with a focus  
group\:  
•  
•  
First part of the time\: Have people use the product either with a  
person watching and listening to each participant or letting the  
participants work on their own and take their own notes on where  
they succeed and where they have problems.  
Second part of the time\: Bring them together to talk about the  
experience. A final point\: Test the content!! 315  
Hal Shubin’s story would be an example. I’ve done this, calling it a task-  
based focus group.  
# A final point\: Test the content!!  
Lots of companies now do usability testing, but too many still focus only on  
the information architecture – on whether people can find what they need.  
That’s necessary. But it’s not enough. If your site visitors get to the right  
place, but the content doesn’t work for them, they’ll be frustrated and  
leave.  
Don’t stop when site visitors get to the right web page. Have them  
actually find the information on the page to satisfy their conversation or  
your test scenario.  
If they are doing a transactional task \(buying something, booking a  
ticket\), watch them complete the task.  
If they are looking up information, ask them to tell you what the content  
says. Don’t just assume they have absorbed the message because they  
looked at the page.  
Watch what they do on content pages. Do they skim? Do they read carefully?  
What parts do they read? Listen to what they say about the content.  
Do usability testing to learn\:  
•  
•  
•  
Does the site have the content your site visitors want and need?  
Is the content presented with good information design – legible  
typography, good spacing, visible and useful headings?  
Is the content organized and broken up in a way that works for your  
site visitors?  
•  
•  
•  
Does the writing help site visitors skim easily and read quickly?  
Are you using words that your site visitors understand immediately?  
Do site visitors interpret images to have the messages you meant?  
Yes, you might ask them what they think of what they found. But also  
ask them to tell you what messages they got from the content. Test  
understand and use as well as find.  
I hope this book has helped you create great content so that usability  
testing shows you are meeting your business goals by satisfying your site  
visitors’ conversations.
