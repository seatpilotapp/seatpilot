277 Foreword \_  
Let’s for a moment explore what we all do in the events industry.  
We gather people together to celebrate, to mark occasions both great and small,  
through which we seek to motivate and to communicate with our audience. We  
are only successful in these endeavors if we get through to and touch the humanity  
of our audience—the “hair on the back of the neck” test, if you like.  
We are in the business of human emotions. At the most basic level we engage in  
a singular encounter and scale up our projects to the largest most complex shows  
on earth. At the core of what we do is to talk to each and every member of our  
audiences, one on one, appealing to the drivers that solicit emotional responses,  
from elation to anticipation to empathy. The understanding and manipulation of  
these triggers is the magic we weave.  
Consider, for example, Loy Krathong, the Thai moon festival\: The simplicity  
of placing a candle in a floating lantern to be released into a river is an act of devotion  
and at the same time a celebration of humanity. It is the articulation of ancestral  
respect and of the dreams and aspirations of a people. As the little glowing boats  
set off carrying their prayers and dreams, one glowing boat becomes two, becomes  
two thousand, becomes two million, and presto—you have a large-scale event, all  
derived from a single, simple human act.  
All societies use ceremony \(profound and frivolous\) to capture or commemorate  
moments in time. It is the marking of those moments in time that allows us  
as individuals, families, and communities to share our humanity or traditions  
and our dreams with loved ones, friends, neighbors, and, on occasion, the world.  
Ceremony has always been part of the rhythm and structure of our lives. It defines Foreword  
the cycle of our lives and forms a large part of how we define and record our indi-  
vidual and collective history.  
It is from these celebrations that our modern practices all derive structures,  
which haven't changed all that much over the ages. Our shared humanity is built  
around ritual in conjunction with the milestones of life—birth, rights of passage,  
marriage, the change of seasons, anniversaries, death—and the worship of idols,  
gods, and celebrities. The way we celebrate helps to tell us who we are, both inti-  
mately and publicly.  
Ceremonies have always been a part of how we mark and celebrate significant  
public events such as festivals, fetes, and pageants. The observance of ritual and  
participation in civic celebrations brings us together as a community and informs  
us of our collective heritage and traditions. These traditions handed down to us as  
part of our cultural inheritance are part of what gives us meaning and defines us  
culturally. It’s also about having fun, celebrating life—/a joie de vivre!  
The cultural events and ceremonies associated with major sporting events have  
become significant in their own right. These days, it’s not unusual for a struc-  
tured, highly elaborate ceremony to be included as part of sporting events. The  
power and influence of these ceremonies have evolved to the extent that they have  
become disciplines unto themselves, offering the host city and country an oppor-  
tunity to tell their story to the world.  
The continuing dissemination to a truly global audience and more sophisticated  
coverage through television and now the Internet have changed the way we par-  
ticipate in great public celebrations and occasions. It’s no longer necessary to be  
present to be part of the crowd, the drama, the pageantry. The world can merely  
tune in for the widescreen HD, even 3D “experience.” We can stream the event  
in real time to our computers and mobile communication devices, and we can  
comment concurrently via blogs and twitter as the event progresses. But you know,  
there is nothing like being there!  
Ceremonies have in many ways become the embodiment of the Olympic  
motto, “Citius, Altius, Fortius’—“faster, higher, stronger.” They are becoming  
more sophisticated in their conception and execution as well as the range of mes-  
sages they communicate and the objectives they attempt to realize. At the same  
time, they are potentially delivering a greater reward to hosts and having a greater  
positive impact on more people across the globe than ever before.  
The Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games is now watched by something  
in excess of four billion people. That’s huge reach. This can be a double-edged  
sword, as global perceptions are very fickle. The “awe” precision of the spectacular  
opening to the Beijing games sent mixed messages and in some quarters received  
a cool if not confused response to the dogmatic, highly stylized approach. Getting  
the balance just right is the ongoing challenge. These ceremonies last only a short  
time, yet in that time the world’s perception of the host nation can radically change. Foreword  
This was the experience in Athens. In the lead up to the Athens 2004 Olympic  
Games, the media had been brutal in questioning the Athens Organizing  
Committee's readiness and capability to deliver the single largest sporting event  
on the planet. As far as the media were concerned, Athens 2004 was going to bea  
disaster. But immediately after the Opening Ceremony, it was clear that the world  
was now united in its praise of the ambition, imagination, technical brilliance,  
and artistry of an opening ceremony unlike any before. And more importantly,  
the world’s perception changed dramatically; from then on Greece could do no  
wrong—a perception later substantiated by the success of the Games themselves.  
It's also a reminder of how quickly things can change!  
What is common to all events and ceremonies is that they are designed to  
mark and celebrate a unique moment in time and to differentiate one time from  
another and one place from another. What is apparent is that the role and format  
of these public events and ceremonies is constantly evolving. Cultural events and  
ceremonies are becoming more and more elaborate, and more integral both in  
terms of reach and perceived success.  
The sophistication of the world’s major events, and indeed events in general,  
and their experiential rise has seen each project become more and more compli-  
cated and the stakes become higher. It follows that the people managing these  
events are required to be more experienced and professional. It is no longer the  
realm of the enthusiastic amateur. Education, training, and indeed academic  
qualifications are now a prerequisite for entry into the industry, and ongoing  
professional development is critical for anyone working in the events industry.  
Readers of this book by Julia Rutherford Silvers will gain insight into the com-  
plexities of staging events and will find thousands of ideas and possibilities for  
large and small events of all types. She not only discusses the strategies and tactics  
of creating events that achieve their objectives and are meaningful to event-goers;  
she examines the challenges associated with selecting and implementing them in a  
safe and successful manner. In an industry that spans the globe and has the power  
to affect countless people and perceptions, today’s event professionals will benefit  
from her concepts and comprehensive look at event management. I congratulate  
Julia on her research and authorship; this book is a must have in the personal  
resource library of anyone in the events field.  
The work we all do, the stories we tell \(and it’s all about narrative\), must con-  
vey enduring values. We must be distinctive and engage our audience, whatever  
the scale. The world is composed of wildly contrasting cultural experiences,  
but we are all nevertheless united in our ability to dream and to be inspired.  
Through our endeavors we can be united in our humanity and our common  
human aspirations.  
Originality, theatricality, spectacle, and scale are all key ingredients in the  
realization of all events. Technology and innovation also play a strong part. But Foreword  
spectacle and technology are simply a means to’an end. They will not compensate  
for a lack of narrative, content, or passion. Which is why, when you plan an event,  
make sure you have the skills and tools to deliver at the world’s best standards—  
with sincerity!

Recently my students produced a 5K fun run to raise funds for Comic Relief.  
The students were required to produce a five minute video documenting their  
process of coordinating this event. The assignment required references from sev-  
eral academic sources. Throughout this video the students consistently stated,  
“According to Julia Rutherford Silvers...” and of course they were quoting chap-  
ter and verse the first edition of Professional Event Coordination which was their  
primary text for this course.  
Julia has been quoted throughout the world because she not only is an accom-  
plished professional coordinator of events but also has the rare ability to underpin  
her professional practice with scholarly models, tables, figures and other critical  
information to insure sustainable successful events. She is one of the very few  
individuals in the world who has successfully made the transition from produc-  
ing professional events to influencing tens of thousands of individuals and there-  
fore hundreds of thousands of events through her brilliant examples and logical  
approach to professional event coordination.  
As one of the key founders of the Event Management Body of Knowledge  
\(EMBOK\) project, Julia has worked with professionals and scholars through-  
out the world to develop the systems, strategies and formulas to rapidly  
improve this growing field of study and practice. She is regularly called upon  
by professionals and associations throughout the world to share her expertise  
and talent as a professional speaker and writer. As a result of her many talents Series Editor Foreword  
and unending contributions to the planned events industry, she is one of the  
most honored persons of the past two decades.  
Her book, which has quickly become a classic and best seller in the field and  
study of special events coordination, is used throughout the world to ensure that  
events achieve a greater level of professionalism and creativity. As a direct result of  
the first edition of this book tens of thousands of events are now more effective,  
achieve higher attendance, delight guests with their creativity, and perhaps most  
importantly, are conducted more safely.  
The second edition of this important book takes the profession of event coor-  
dination to a much higher level with several new key interviews with industry  
leaders from throughout the world. In addition, Julia has included new examples  
to guide beginning as well as experienced event coordinators throughout the  
anatomy of the event.  
While my students continue to refer to Julia Rutherford Silvers as their expert  
on professional event coordination, I am certain that in the years to come her influ-  
ence and the powerful ideas within this book will grow even stronger. Professional  
Event Coordination, Second Edition, is their and now your essential reference tool  
for those who aspire to produce professional events and should be placed within  
arms’ reach of every event planner.  
When asked by a client how long Julia had taken to prepare a proposal for a  
prospective event she responded, “All my life.” Within these pages is a lifetime  
of professional experience to guide you to a new level of professionalism that  
will result in exquisitely and seamlessly coordinated special events. May you one  
day respond as did Julia when asked “How long did it take you?” with simply,  
“As long as it took me to read, understand, and apply Julia Rutherford Silvers’  
Professional Event Coordination, Second Edition.” Then, you will join the ranks of  
thousands of students and professionals who regularly refer to Julia as their guid-  
ing light for professionally coordinated events throughout the world.

Series Editor Preface  
True happiness involves the full use of one’s power and talents.  
—John W. Gardner, American educator \(1912-2002\)  
What led you to the world of events? Are you simply “trying it on” to see if it isa  
good fit for you? Was it because you worked at an event and it looked like it would  
be fun to organize them? Did you attend an event that had a profound effect on  
you? Were you “thrown” into organizing events as a part of your job duties? Or, like  
me, was it a journey through happenstance that culminated in finding a profession  
that used all of your talents?  
My journey began at age 14 in the community theaters here in Albuquerque,  
New Mexico, where I began to use my creative talents to design costumes. This  
unleashed my organizational skills as well, and gave me a foundation in project  
management—if the costumes weren't finished by opening night, the people on  
stage would be naked. I studied art, theater, and teaching in college, which honed  
both my artistic and analytical abilities. Since then I have been a professional  
costume designer and performer, an art history librarian, an exhibitor in arts and  
crafts fairs \(hand-painted silks\), the manager of one of New Mexico's premier arts  
and crafts fairs, and president and creative director of my own special event com-  
pany. Now I research and write about the skills, knowledge, and experience neces-  
sary to succeed in the events industry, and strive to share this through my books,  
articles, educational programs, and on my Web site \(www. juliasilvers.com\).  
I have created events ranging from theme parties to community festivals and  
sports events to multi-city product launches. I’ve organized public and private  
celebrations, conferences, fundraisers, expositions, corporate hospitality events,  
company parties, award galas, fashion shows, bar and bat mitzvahs, grand open-  
ings, familiarization tours, and industrial field trips. In fact, you will find many of XIV Preface  
these events reflected in the stories at the beginning and the exercises at the end of  
each chapter. I have traveled the world speaking to event professionals who have  
participated in all aspects of event coordination, and I have tried to incorporate as  
much of that collective knowledge into this book as possible.  
Using This Book  
Whether you are preparing to enter this profession, preparing for advancement within  
it, preparing for certification as a professional, or seeking to improve your skills in a  
volunteer position, this book will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the  
competencies required of a professional event coordinator. I hope that it will also  
become a reference tool you may use throughout your professional career. It includes  
a broad spectrum of options and opportunities for creating event experiences that  
serve the needs of the client or host and fulfill the expectations of the guest or attendee.  
Each chapter begins with a set of objectives that are based on competency  
points from various international industry certification programs and ends with  
a set of Exercises in Professional Event Coordination that will reinforce the  
concepts and competencies in practical applications, and gives you an opportunity  
to “stretch your creativity” with a wide range of event types and situations. In addition,  
numerous checklists and models are included in every chapter to help you understand  
and better refine your skills as a professional event coordinator.  
New in This Edition  
There have been tremendous changes in the event industry since the first edition  
was published—new technologies, economic challenges, social media, sustainability  
agendas, increasing demand for accountability and return on investment, and  
heightened transparency due to nearly limitless and global media coverage. This  
edition addresses all these issues and more.  
° There are new sections on topics such as event legibility, learning environments,  
and Web-based events.  
\* Information and communications technology trends and strategies that increase  
productivity and enhance the experience are discussed throughout the book.  
¢ There are new On-Site Insights—industry professionals from every corner of  
the world providing real-world examples of events from Asia, Australia, Canada,  
Germany, Iceland, and the Middle East, as well as sound advice on working with  
volunteers, selecting keynote speakers, ensuring safe audiovisual settings, and more.  
¢ There are interviews with event professionals responsible for some of the  
biggest and most famous events in the world, including the Olympic Games,  
the NFL Super Bowl, and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Preface  
XV  
\* In addition to new ideas on making events “greener,” there is a new chapter  
that deals with the full range of sustainability issues surrounding events,  
including how to ensure your career will endure in this global profession.  
¢ Finally, at the end of each chapter you will find Review Checkpoints that  
help you test your comprehension of the material presented, Cyberspace  
Connections that lead you to online resources, and Suggestions for Further  
Reading should you wish to pursue an in-depth study of the topics covered.  
Structure of the Book  
The book is organized into six parts \(as shown in Figure P.1\) that take the reader  
through a logical progression of the various assessment, design, and administrative  
aspects of professional event coordination. You might choose to read and study  
the chapters in sequence, or you can focus on topics according to your personal  
order of preference. However, it is important to understand that they are all inter-  
connected parts of the whole; each affects and is affected by every other part.  
Part I, Chapters 1 through 4, examines the anatomy of an event to establish  
the different layers of an event experience and the general process of professional  
event coordination. Based on this foundation, it considers the assessment of the

various elements of an event, which can allow the event coordinator to visualize,  
organize, and synchronize the event's resources and operations through project  
management techniques. Next it explores the critical aspects of site selection and  
development to ensure that the location and layout of the event meet its needs.  
Finally, although not particularly glamorous, it is important to arrange for the  
essential services that provide the necessary infrastructure for the event, as well as  
mitigate the event’s impact on its neighbors and the environment.  
Parts II through V address the six dimensions of an event experience \(introduced  
in Chapter 1\). In Chapter 5, inviting attendees and providing them with the  
appropriate access to the event site is considered from the perspective of cus-  
tomer service as the professional event coordinator plans to accommodate the  
event’s audience. Chapters 6 and 7 move into the discussion of event design by  
examining the creative and practical aspects of coordinating the event environ-  
ment through theme design, décor, and numerous other staging considerations  
including technical productions. Chapters 8 and 9 delve into the entertainment  
possibilities that set the stage for an engaging event experience as well as the vari-  
ous ancillary programs and mini-events that not only entertain and enrich, but  
also support the objectives of the event. The discussion in Chapter 10 provides a  
taste of food and beverage possibilities and practicalities by investigating catering  
operations, menu design, and food service styles, and Chapter 11 explores the  
various opportunities for adding value and meaning to the event experience, such  
as the selection and presentation of gifts and amenities.  
Part VI investigates the administrative duties associated with the design choices  
made. Chapter 12 discusses making the plans for the safety and security of the  
event's guests and workers, and organizing the services and strategies to ensure safe  
operations before, during, and after the event. Chapter 13 explores the supplier  
solicitation and selection process, as well as vendor relations, and discusses human  
resource management issues as they relate to staffing, volunteers, and participants.  
Chapter 14 examines performance reviews, evaluation techniques, and information  
management strategies that help the professional event coordinator to continually  
improve his or her performance and operations. Finally, Chapter 15 focuses on the  
strategies for sustainable success for both the event and the event professional.  
Why This Book Is  
Important to You  
Professional event coordination is a complex job, one that requires due diligence—  
the investigation and consideration of all the requirements and possibilities,  
both good and bad, for the event. The topics covered in this book are what you  
must consider for each and every event you undertake. It is also important to Preface  
understand that each topic represents an entire course of study in and of itself, many  
representing distinct industries within the overall event management industry.  
You are not expected to be an expert in each field, nor could one book provide  
the entire body of knowledge for each field, but as a professional event coordina-  
tor, you are expected to know enough to be able to effectively procure, organize,  
implement, monitor, and evaluate all the products, services, and service providers  
that will bring an event to life.  
Creating and producing events is an exhilarating and sometimes exhausting  
occupation, but it is always rewarding—emotionally, spiritually, and often eco-  
nomically. The professional event coordinator must be flexible, energetic, well  
organized, detail-oriented, and a quick thinker. As a professional event coordinator,  
you must understand the integrated processes, plans, and possibilities specific to  
each event you coordinate so that you will be a better planner, producer, purchaser,  
and partner in delivering the special event experience that exceeds expectations.  
Trappist monk and social activist Thomas Merton once said, “Every moment  
and every event of every man’s life on earth plants something in his soul.” We must  
always remember that although not every event is a milestone for us, it could be one  
for the client or guest. From festivals and fairs to meetings and conventions, fund-  
raising events to familial occasions, civic celebrations to athletic competitions, or  
parades to theme parties—every event is special. What we do as professional event  
coordinators touches people’s souls and makes dreams come true. It is an awesome  
responsibility, but worth the journey.

—Alfred North Whitehead, English philosopher \(1861-1947,  
When asked how long it took me to design something, I always answered, “All my  
life.” When asked how I was able to write this book, I will always have to answer,  
“All my friends.” This book would simply not have been possible without the help  
and guidance of friends and colleagues throughout the world, as well as all those  
who have published before me. My sincerest gratitude goes to those who have  
been unfailing in their support and eagerness to share their experience and expertise,  
not only with me, but also with the industry as a whole.  
First, to my husband Larry, eternal thanks for supporting me in ways too  
numerous to mention; you are the core of all my possibilities. To the Wiley Event  
Management Series Editor, Joe Goldblatt, EdD, CSEP, an icon and true friend  
with whom I have been privileged to work on numerous educational projects, my

# ASSESSMENT  
We can make the trains run on time but if they are  
not going where we want them to go, why bother?  
——Neil Postman, American author \(1931-2003\)  
My husband told me once that he had been to hundreds of social, business, and  
cultural events in his life, but until I started my event company it never occurred  
to him that someone was in charge of organizing everything. Somehow, when he  
showed up, the decorations or food or tents or music were just there.  
This is what events look like to the regular person, someone not involved in the  
world of professional event coordination. We, however, know better. We know  
that organizing an event involves hundreds, even thousands, of decisions about  
where we want to go, why, and what is needed to get us there. Choices must be  
made about what products, services, venues, equipment, and tactics will be most  
beneficial in achieving the desired outcomes of the event, and must be made  
within the confines of time, money, spatial, and human resource limitations.  
The following four chapters address the structural foundation for an event,  
including strategic goals and objectives, project management, and the essential  
requirements needed for the decorations or food or tents or music to just be there  
for that regular person. viiapesstoto pS

event coordination.  
e Appreciate the scope of responsibilities associated with professional  
event coordination.  
e Identify the dimensions of an event experience.

attendance. The activities, environment, and layers of multisensory effects are  
integrated into an event design that is staged and choreographed with precision and  
polish. The best event experience is one in which the mechanics are imperceptible to  
the attendee and the intended impact is delivered effectively and invisibly.

The Role and Scope of  
Professional Event Coordination  
There is a reason for every event, and there can be an event for every reason. An  
event, any type of event, is held for a purpose. Public or private, commercial or  
charitable, celebratory or commemorative—events bring people together to share an  
experience and produce a measurable outcome. The event experience might be a  
civic celebration or a charity fundraiser, an anniversary or a wedding, a corporate  
product introduction or incentive program, a sports event, or a convention event.  
It might be a company picnic, a hospitality reception, a grand opening, or a fam-  
ily reunion. Professional event coordination is the integrated implementation of  
all the operational and logistical requirements of an event, based on the scope of  
event elements included in the event design. It is the job of the professional event  
coordinator to package and manage that event experience.  
Professional event coordinators have different job titles, depending on the type of  
event or the company in which they are employed. These can include conference man-  
ager, convention planner, convention services manager, director of events, event man-  
ager, event organizer, event planner, event project manager, meeting manager, meeting  
planner, professional conference organizer, special events coordinator, special events  
manager, trade show coordinator, trade show manager, wedding consultant, and many  
more designations. In fact, numerous studies have shown that individuals performing  
this work often do not even have the words event \(or type of event\), coordinator, or  
manager in the job title \(O”’Toole 2005; Nelson and Silvers 2009\).  
Figure 1.1 provides an overview of the scope of the event genre applicable to  
the event coordination profession. Professional event coordinators often specialize  
in specific types of events and event clientele, focusing on one or two primary  
event genres. However, you should have an understanding of the role and scope  
of all types of events to better serve your target market through the thoughtful and  
comprehensive analysis of the needs, resources, and physical requirements for an  
event. In other words, you might not need to incorporate all the facets and elements The Role and Scope of Professional Event Coordination

discussed in this book for every event, but you should analyze and consider each  
one for every event. You might discover a serious gap in your event plan. You  
might find a strategy for improving the event experience. You might find a feature  
that will facilitate a value-added experience.  
A Complex Profession  
Professional event coordination is a complex and comprehensive endeavor. In  
our conversation more than a decade ago, Janet Landey, CSEP, of Party Design  
CC in Johannesburg, South Africa, expressed her amazement at many customers’  
lack of understanding of the scope of an event\: “What did you expect, a couple of Anatomy of an Event  
balloons in the boot \[trunk\] of my car?” You are making hundreds or even thou-  
sands of choices and decisions, then managing the details that emerge from those  
decisions\) You must consider administrative matters, design parameters, marketing  
implications, logistical issues, legal questions, and risk management ramifications.  
You are managing time, money, people, information, and technology as well as the  
expectations of the event stakeholders including attendees, guests, hosts, clients,  
and sponsors. |  
There aré numerous ways to approach this complexity that allow the profes-  
sional event coordinator to ensure that attention is given to the entire scope of the  
event and that it is structured and thorough. One resource is a framework for  
the Event Management Body of Knowledge, the International EMBOK Model,  
devised by a coalition of experts in event management \(www.embok.org\). This  
framework includes a definition of the phases, processes, and core values of event  
management, as well as the functional areas and categories to which these are  
applied \(see Figure 1.2\). It is the functional domains that provide a systematic and  
comprehensive approach to the responsibilities and opportunities associated with  
professional event coordination\:  
\* Administration—financial, human resources, information, procurement, stake-  
holder, systems, and time management  
\* Design—content, entertainment, environment, food and beverage, production,  
program, and theme development and management  
\* Marketing—plan, materials, merchandise, promotions, public relations, sales,  
and sponsorship \(donor\) management  
\* Operations—attendee, communications, infrastructure, logistics, partici-  
pant, site, and technical production management  
\* Risk—compliance, decision, emergency, health and safety, insurance, legal,  
and security management  
The professional event coordinator uses a sequential system \(as reflected primar-  
ily in the phases of the International EMBOK Model\) to consistently produce  
events of any genre or scope that deliver the intended event experiences\:  
1. Conduct the necessary research to determine expectations and create a cus-  
tomer profile of the event attendees or participants.  
2. Conceptualize the event, assessing the scope of the event required to meet  
expectations.  
3. Determine which event elements and components will provide the features  
of the desired experience.  
4. Visualize how all these event components will and must fit together, and  
design the strategy for implementation.  
5. Select the best products and providers that are available and affordable.  
6. Monitor the delivery of the experience. The Role and Scope of Professional Event Coordination

of Speaking of Events  
Determine the Expectations  
Start with the basic information\: who, what, where, when, and, most important, why.  
Who are the intended guests or audience? What are the demographics? How many  
are expected? What type of function is it? What is the history of the event? What has  
worked before and what hasn't? What did the guests or attendees like and dislike?  
When will the event take place? What date or dates, and at what times? What  
else will be happening concurrently and in conjunction with the event? Where is  
the event to be held? Where have the guests attended events in the past? Where  
are they from? What type of experience will fit their personalities and preferences?  
Why is the event being held? The professional event coordinator must have a  
clear understanding of the purpose of the event, as well as the goals and objectives  
for the event. The goal or objective might be to express appreciation for a job well  
done or to celebrate a cultural heritage. It might be to increase sales or increase  
awareness. It does not matter whether the event experience is paid for with cash or  
with the investment of time and effort; the experience must have value.  
Develop your evaluation strategy from the very beginning by specifying the  
measurements that will indicate success. Draw this information out of the cli-  
ent. Such measurements can include attendance figures, revenues, perceptions,  
or publicity. Even a family reunion, surprise birthday party, or wedding will have  
measurable objectives\: having special people in attendance, guest enjoyment  
Figure 1.2

Model Anatomy of an Event  
levels, or having an event more lavish than that of a colleague, neighbor, or rival.  
Some clients will be very explicit about what they want to achieve with the event;  
others are unable to articulate their expectations.  
Develop the Concept  
The professional event coordinator must put together an overall picture of the  
final event, the concept, to be able to incorporate all the necessary elements  
and components, as well as to merge the logistical and operational parameters and  
practices into the event plan. Some professional event coordinators prefer to start  
with the concept, developing the theme or event name, in a manner similar to  
composing the title of a book or a film. Then they start filling in all the details,  
like roots growing from the base of a tree. Others begin with the event elements,  
building a pyramid with all the details until the complete picture or vision of the  
event emerges. Still others use both an inductive and deductive approach. It is  
important to recognize that the entire event must be envisioned and implemented  
in your head, and on paper, before the first step is taken.  
Design the Experience  
Remember that you are packaging and managing an experience. This means that  
you must envision that experience, from start to finish, from the attendees’ point of  
view. Imagine every minute of their experience. Identify event elements and com-  
ponents that will enhance that experience. Identify elements that will build on pre-  
vious successes, elements that will take advantage of opportunities and strengths,  
and elements that will mitigate challenges, weaknesses, and threats.  
Deliver the Dream  
The advice, “ruthlessly prepare for it, and flawlessly execute it” \(LoCicero 2008,  
215\), suggests the zeal with which you need to approach your event project.  
Choreograph the experience by anticipating attendee needs, wants, and expecta-  
tions, then arranging the elements and adding layers of detail that will provide  
a memorable experience. Think of everything so they don't have to. The best  
compliment a professional event coordinator can receive is that no one asked  
for directions or questioned what was happening. The best tribute a professional  
event coordinator can receive occurs when the host or client can take a bow for a  
fantastic and hugely successful event.  
Virtually all events include six dimensions to the experience \(see Figure 1.3\).  
To deliver the dream—that value-added event experience—the professional event  
coordinator must incorporate these six dimensions into a cohesive whole, each  
one supporting the others, each integrated into a complete and progressive experi-  
ence\: anticipation, arrival, atmosphere, activity, appetite, and amenities. Making Anticipation

that dream a reality, however, depends on rigorously focusing on the needs identi-  
fied in the assessment as well as the administrative necessities associated with all  
the resources required and acquired for the dream delivery.  
Anticipation ticipat  
It is human nature to want something to look forward to. The first dimension  
of the event experience is the anticipation created with the announcement of the  
event. You might create the foundation for an entire marketing strategy, such  
as with an incentive program, or set the stage for a spectator spectacle such as  
an entertainment or sports event. You are thereby establishing expectations and  
building excitement for the event through the initial communications.  
The invitations, notices, brochures, publicity, advertising, and/or promotions  
that will create this anticipation must be planned from the very inception of the

event and incorporated into the budget and the timeline \(see Figure 1.4\). These  
materials must be designed to prepare the individual for the event experience.  
They must be timed appropriately to reach the recipient in enough time to inform,  
yet should not be so early that the anticipation wanes. Sometimes numerous  
impressions will be required to build and sustain anticipation.  
Marketing the Experience  
You are always selling something—a product, a service, an idea. You're trying to cre-  
ate interest and desire so another person will want it, accept it, or invest in it. In this  
case, it is an event and an event experience you are selling. In designing an invitation  
to acharity gala or a brochure for a conference, you must create interest in the event,  
enticing the guest or attendee to invest time, and probably money, to attend the  
event. Whether sending out handcrafted invitations for a bar mitzvah, direct mail  
flyers for a civic festival, or agendas for a meeting, the principle is the same. You must  
influence the targeted “customer” to make the decision to attend or participate.  
To provide effective preevent communications, you must understand what will  
motivate the guests or attendees—why they would or should want to attend—and  
incorporate those inducements into a compelling format. You must understand  
their purchase decision processes. Remember that the decision to purchase relates  
not only to exchanging money for a product. It refers to exchanging resources,  
such as time and emotional investment, for the event experience—“buying into”  
the purpose of the event.  
A Communications Issue  
Determine where, when, why, and how these purchase decisions are made so  
you can develop the appropriate strategy to create interest and anticipation for  
the event. Does the first conference brochure need to reach attendees prior to  
their annual budget process so that costs can be incorporated into that budget?  
Does the first poster or flyer for the community arts festival need to be prepared  
a month prior to the event, or a year before the event, so these materials can be  
distributed through the local tourism agencies to potential visitors and commer-  
cial tour operators?  
Provide the information required to facilitate successful participation in the  
event experience. Communicate the basics—who, what, when, where, why, how,  
and how much. Prepare the attendees or guests for the experience, furnishing the  
directions, instructions, and recommendations that will enhance their experience.  
Convey and reinforce the purpose of the event, the reason the event is being  
held and the reasons the guests will benefit from attending. Find ways to intensify  
the anticipation factor, building the excitement and commitment to attend,  
participate, and enjoy the event experience. Arrival  
11  
# Arrival  
The journey begins the moment the decision is made to attend an event. Plans  
are formed, tickets are purchased, reservations are made, schedules are established,  
and hundreds of other personal and professional details are put in motion in  
order for the attendee to arrive at the right time and place for the event. As the  
professional event coordinator, you may or may not be responsible for arranging  
such details for the attendee or guest, but you should consider all these aspects to  
determine what you can do to facilitate the logistics of the arrival \(see Figure 1.5\).  
Travel and Transportation  
The guest or attendee might be traveling across town or around the world to attend  
the event. How can the professional event coordinator enhance and improve this  
facet of the event experience? Understand the resources that will be available and  
how the attendee will likely utilize them. When looking at travel to an event site,  
particularly from another country, city, or locale, consider the options the traveler  
might use\: trains, airplanes, boats, buses, and/or private automobiles.  
Analyze the potential arrival schedules and evaluate the arrival facilities to determine  
what attendees will likely encounter. Will they need rental cars? Will they need direc-  
tional maps sent to them prior to their departure? Do you need to prepare a fact sheet  
on passports, visas, and customs regulations? Provide the information they will need  
to have as smooth a travel experience as possible, preparing them for what to expect.  
Arrival patterns must also be taken into account. Are all the attendees expected  
to arrive at the same time? What will be needed to make certain they will be  
accommodated efficiently and effectively? Do you need more entrances to the  
event site? Can you arrange for more personnel at the check-in desk at the hotel?  
Should you alert the taxi and rental car companies so they will be appropriately  
staffed and their inventory sufficient?  
Ground transportation must be considered for attendees arriving at their des-  
tination. How will they transfer from place to place? You must know the cus-  
tomer. Some people wish to be in complete control of their comings and goings,  
others expect to be chauffeured and shuttled. If all persons attending the event

are expected to provide their own transportation to the event site, you must still  
anticipate and facilitate that experience, perhaps by providing traffic control,  
parking facilities, or valet parking services. You might need to arrange for motor  
coaches or shuttle buses. You might be organizing limousine services or antique  
automobiles, or even a fleet of motorcycles.  
Meeting and Greeting  
Travel, both to and at an event location, can set the tone for the attendee’s experience.  
The professional event coordinator must understand that no matter how excited the  
guest or attendee is or how intense the anticipation may be, travel is hard work. It  
is fraught with potential minor and major disasters and distractions. Lost luggage,  
long lines, and tedious layovers can quickly turn anticipation into frustration, which  
is not the way an event coordinator wants the experience to be remembered.  
Many aspects of a frustrating travel experience could be mitigated with a warm  
welcome that redefines that first impression. This can include anything from  
welcome signs and personnel at the airport and banners around town to a welcome  
basket in a guest’s hotel room. You want to communicate that the travelers are in  
the right place and you are glad they are here.  
Navigation and Directional Signs  
The professional event coordinator must ensure that the attendees or guests can  
navigate their way to and through the event site. Such help should start with the  
information provided in the invitation or instructions, including maps and direc-  
tions \(see Figure 1.6\), but it usually must be supplemented with on-site signs. It  
is, again, a matter of anticipating the attendee’s needs and providing answers to  
questions before they have to be asked.  
Assume that you are new to the city, and consider how you would find your  
way from the train station to the event grounds. How will you find your way if  
you do not speak or read the language? How will you find your way to the first  
aid station at an outdoor festival or to your assigned table in a gigantic banquet  
hall? How will you find your way to the right meeting room in a huge convention  
center? At every point along the route where a decision can or must be made,  
determine how you can communicate the information needed for the attendee or  
guest to make the right directional choice.  
Welcoming Entrances  
Welcoming entrances will reestablish the expectations of event attendees. A  
brightly decorated entrance to the festival grounds will bring attendees back  
into the excitement and anticipation felt when the decision was made to attend.  
A well-designed registration area will communicate to conference-goers that the Arrival

event will be well run and worthwhile. A themed entryway will help guests at a  
theme party to make the transition from the real world outside into the fantasy  
world to be experienced inside.  
Sometimes decorations and signs alone are not enough. The professional event  
coordinator should also consider incorporating personnel and performers into the  
entrance design. According to Anton Shone \(2001, 223\), people arriving at an  
unfamiliar location will first seek a person to ask directions from before referring  
to signs. It is important always to provide someone who can answer questions  
about the event and the event site, either at the entrance or at a well-positioned  
hospitality desk or information station. Costumed characters, sight acts or variety  
performers, hosts and hostesses, and other individuals can add that human con-  
nection between the guest and the event experience. 14  
Anatomy of an Event  
Don’t Forget the Departure  
Give the same consideration to the departure as you do to the arrival. The same  
requirements apply—signs, instructions and directions, transportation and travel.  
The last impression of an event experience will be just as powerful as, if not more  
than, the first impression. It is often said that most guests remember the entrance  
and the dessert. Consider the memories you are creating if there are long lines of cars  
trying to get out of the parking lot or crowded shuttles to the hotel or if attendees  
have no idea where it is safe to go to dinner after the conference program ends that  
afternoon. The event experience must be considered from start to finish, and it is  
not finished until the attendees or guests are back home safe and sound. Exercise the  
same care and creativity for their departure as you do for their arrival.  
# Atmosphere  
The atmosphere of an event relies on the physical environment, both inherent  
in and imposed on the venue or event site. Each component of the physical site,  
from theme décor and props to the location of the toilet facilities, will have an  
impact on the experience \(see Figure 1.7\).  
The Physical Environment Basics  
The environment of an event is developed to meet and serve the physical needs  
of the attendee while enhancing the style and substance of the event experience.  
Temperature will affect comfort levels and enjoyment. The actual space allotment  
per person will affect the satisfaction level. The physical layout of venue features  
and furnishings can contribute to the achievement of event goals and objectives.  
The layout of the event should promote the desired choreography of the event  
experience. If guests are expected to mingle, fewer chairs will be required than for  
a spectator event where everyone is to be seated. If attendees are expected to move

through the event space, such as at an exposition or street fair, then positioning of  
event elements can facilitate traffic flow. The guests must be able to see and hear  
what is going on, and this can require technical augmentation such as lighting and  
sound systems. Lighting and sound can also be used to create a new reality for an  
event space, establishing a particular ambiance or fantasy setting.  
The professional event coordinator must consider all the physical needs of the  
guest or attendee. Drinking water should always be available, especially in a hot cli-  
mate. Sheltered areas should be provided at outdoor events in any weather. A coat  
check area should be considered for any event at which the guests will be arriving  
wearing bulky outerwear. Of course, toilet facilities must be sufficient for the volume  
of guests or attendees expected and should be fully accessible to those with disabilities.  
Safety and security must be considered in terms of ingress, access, and egress.  
Guests and attendees must be able to get in, get around, and get out of a venue  
quickly and safely. Entrances and exits must be visible and obvious; often they  
must be protected from unlawful or unauthorized entry.  
The Venue—Embrace the Place or Surprise Their Eyes  
The venue, the site of an event, has an inherent atmosphere. This can be an asset or a  
liability. Some venues are fully functional and others require extensive site develop-  
ment. It is incumbent upon the professional event coordinator to arrange for every-  
thing needed to create the desired ambiance and meet the physical requirements.  
Unusual or unique venues offer numerous creative opportunities and challenges.  
For example, hosting a high school reunion in the school gymnasium reinforces  
the nostalgia of the event. However, you might face restrictions on what equipment  
may be placed on the gymnasium floor and whether alcoholic beverages may be  
served on school property.  
There are two approaches to the utilization of an event venue. You can “embrace  
the place,” highlighting its intrinsic features, or you can “surprise their eyes,”  
completely transforming the facility or site into a totally unexpected environment.  
To embrace the place, you might use dramatic lighting to enhance architectural  
features of a building’s interior or exterior for a grand opening, or perhaps create  
sculptural buffet displays on pedestals for a charity reception in a museum. To  
surprise their eyes, you might transform an empty warehouse into a trendy  
nightclub atmosphere, or turn a hotel ballroom into a hot, steamy jungle.  
Form Follows Function  
The dictum form follows function, coined by American architect Louis Sullivan  
\(Sullivan 1896\), suggests that the event site must be functional, meeting the require-  
ments for fulfilling the function of the event—its purpose, goals, and objectives.  
Educational events require appropriate learning environments. Entertainment 16

and spectator events require sufficient and controlled seating systems. Gala din-  
ner dances require enough space for dining\*tables, a dance floor, and a stage for  
an orchestra.  
Yet this perspective does not preclude creative use of a traditional event space  
or unique venues. With a little imagination, and sometimes a lot of logistical  
expertise, a site can accommodate nearly any function. Assorted tables can be  
fashioned into unusual configurations to create an effective schoolroom setting in  
a cocktail lounge or an elegant dinner along the passageways of an office building.  
You should also keep in mind that with today’s tent technology, you can create an  
event space practically anywhere.  
where Richard Carbotti, founder of Newport, Rhode Island—based Perfect  
Surroundings Inc., had to create the setting for the after party for the Trinity  
Repertory Company’s 12th annual Pell Awards Gala in July 2008.  
The awards ceremony was held in Trinity Repertory’s Chace Theater in  
downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The 500 guests then walked about a  
quarter of a mile, first to the rehearsal space for champagne cocktails and  
then along a roped-off street to the city-block-sized tent covering the parking  
lot. Carbotti explained that they “decorated and choreographed the movement  
with lighting and entertainment, making one of the busiest and worst parts  
of the city glamorous, worthy of the \$500-\$1,000 ticket price.”  
The tent was set up with different thematic regions—European, Asian, and  
Latin—to create “Continental Dining Bars” featuring open lounge-style seating  
and food stations and bars serving region-specific menus and cocktails. Each  
region was decorated with different lighting schemes; murals, fabrics, and  
side-wall draping; chandeliers and draping rigged from the tent'’s ceiling;  
and furnishings and props gathered from antique stores and the theater  
company’s prop department.  
Converting a parking lot to a sumptuous event venue is no small under-  
taking. First, Carbotti noted, “We had to paint the entire lot gray because  
there was no tent flooring and we had to cover up the white lines. Then we  
positioned the bars, tables, gardens, and other décor to cover any hazardous  
parts of the lot such as cracked cement and potholes.” They also had to fac-  
tor in power generators for tent and pathway lighting and fans for’cooling, a |

full catering tent, and a “toilet tent” with high-end portable toilet trailers and  
decorated waiting areas. “This involved a lot of logistics with the city, including  
street closure and other permits, scheduling deliveries, and police and security.  
But a unique venue such as this is an incredible opportunity to create an  
environment that exceeds expectations.”

Finding the Best Fit  
The event site selected should fit the character of the event as well as the char-  
acter of the host. Selecting the best destination and the best venue is a matter  
of understanding the goals and objectives for the event, as well as the budgetary  
and regulatory constraints. An exotic island might seem like the best place for  
an executive retreat or a destination wedding, but can the attendees or guests  
afford to get there? Remember that affordability involves more than money; it  
also includes time away from the office or the public relations impact. A football  
stadium might be the perfect venue for the political rally or rock concert you  
are coordinating, but will the facility management allow you to roll extensive  
and extremely heavy staging onto its precious turf? You might be looking at  
expensive field insurance or replacement costs.  
The great outdoors, whether urban, rural, or extremely remote, can provide  
interesting settings for a broad variety of events. The professional event coordina-  
tor must carefully assess all the functional needs of the event and event attendees  
to be sure that the experience is appropriate. Festivals, fairs, fun runs, and family  
or company picnics are natural events to be staged outdoors, but the event coor-  
dinator might also consider a gala banquet or hospitality reception under the stars  
on the rooftop of a corporate headquarters. What about the top level of a parking  
garage, or the apple orchard on the host's property?  
Activi tivity  
Without exception, there is always something to do at an event. There is always  
some sort of action or activity \(see Figure 1.8\). It may be as simple as conversation  
with fellow guests or as complex as a showy multimedia production incorporating  
music, dancing, laser shows, ceremonies, and interactive demonstrations. It may  
be passive, with the attendees or guests as spectators, or it may be active, with the 18

guests participating in the action. The task for the professional event coordinator  
is to incorporate and choreograph the appropriate activities so they increase the  
value of the event experience.  
Collectable Experiences  
Futurist Alvin TofHler \(1970, 203\) wrote, “Consumers \[will\] begin to collect experi-  
ences as consciously and passionately as they once collected things.” Event experi-  
ences must have value to the customers. They must be worthwhile—worth their  
time and money. You must go back to the customer profile to determine what  
the customer wants, needs, and expects in order to determine what, where, when,  
and how entertainment and activities should be incorporated into the event plan.  
Agendas are used to plan and monitor the activity of a meeting. Variety  
entertainment is employed to direct and redirect attendee focus. Special effects  
are utilized to add emphasis to an awards presentation. Pyrotechnics create an  
electrifying finale to a hallmark event. Kiddie craft areas and inflatable bounce  
cages allow children to enjoy a civic celebration. Opening and closing ceremo-  
nies enhance the spirit of sports events. Dramatic light shows and multimedia  
productions intensify the impact of a product introduction. The right activity will  
increase the value of the experience. Activity  
19  
An Event Is Theater  
Designing an event is similar to writing a theatrical play or movie screenplay. It  
requires a plot \(goals and objectives\), a message \(theme\), and characters \(event  
components\). The action, activities, and entertainment at an event must be care-  
fully scripted. There should be a strong opening, peaks and respites, surprises and  
discoveries, and an exciting finale—all advancing at the appropriate pace and in  
a natural progression. There is always a beginning, a middle, and an ending to an  
experience, which must be clear to the attendee or guest.  
The event experience should have multiple dimensions and layers, providing  
something of interest for each attendee or participant. Live entertainers might  
be incorporated into the environment, such as “talking heads” on a buffet table  
or costumed characters providing walk-around local color. Recorded music or  
sounds might be used to establish a theme environment, such as a flamenco guitar  
to suggest a Spanish cantina atmosphere or the sound of crickets to reinforce a  
nightscape.  
Carnival or casino-style games \(such as a ring toss, balloon darts, roulette table, or  
wheel of fortune\) can be the focus of a charity fundraiser. A strolling violinist might  
add just the right touch to a foundation féte. An interactive presentation by a South  
African drum group might highlight the teambuilding message for a corporate event.  
Whatever entertainment and activities are selected, they should contribute to the  
event choreography, moving the experience through its required progression.  
Participant or Spectator  
In order to accomplish the purpose of an event, the professional event coordinator  
must determine whether the attendees or guests are participatory or passive. Would  
it be advisable to force active types to sit and watch something? Perhaps. Would it  
be appropriate to go against type and provide interactive attractions for a usually  
passive audience? If done correctly, this can be an exciting and effective approach.  
You might slowly introduce action into passive entertainment, such as having  
dancers at a 1950s rock-and-roll theme party start with an exhibition of jitterbug  
dancing, then move into the crowd and draw guests as partners onto the dance  
floor. You might provide some participatory aspects to a spectator event, such as  
bringing audience members up onstage to assist a magician or into the arena to  
compete in a chicken wrangling event at an exhibition rodeo. The spectators may  
become participants, such as in performing “card tricks” in which the audience in  
the grandstands hold up various colored cards to form a massive mosaic picture.  
Consider the entirety of the event when developing the agenda. Incentive planners  
do not schedule an important program or expansive entertainment spectacle the  
first night of the incentive trip, because the guests are probably tired and might be  
affected by jet lag. If normally energetic attendees have been in a classroom setting 20 Anatomy of an Event  
all day at a conference, the evening event will probably need some sort of active  
options to allow them to expend some of their pent-up energy.  
Education versus Entertainment  
Education can be defined as activities for imparting and acquiring knowledge, skills,  
behaviors, attitudes, judgment, preferences, or understanding. Learning is a uni-  
versal endeavor pursued, either incidentally or purposefully, for personal and  
professional reasons. Many events are convened specifically for the purpose of  
learning new things and gathering information on trends, tactics, tools, and tech-  
niques. Other events are designed specifically to create awareness, provide insights,  
and build excitement, commitment, or communities through education and  
persuasion—in other words, communication. In fact, virtually all events could be  
considered “live communication” events, even the “virtual events” delivered in a  
web-based environment such as webinars.  
Learning is achieved by one’s interaction with the environment and those within  
it. People learn from what they see, what they hear, what they do, and whom they  
meet. Learning is enhanced when the educational activities are designed in such a  
way that the messages delivered within that environment, and by those in it, are  
entertaining and engaging. This is where education and entertainment merge into  
what has been termed edutainment. James P. Hogg, PhD, of the Rosen College of  
Hospitality Management at the University of Central Florida advises the follow-  
ing \(Hogg 2010\)\:  
It’s important to recognize that most learners have a 10- to 15-minute maximum  
attention span for educational content; therefore, people need to be entertained  
while being educated. The next generations of learners use laptops and multitask  
to give themselves the level of immersion into edutainment if not provided by the  
facilitator.  
Therefore, educational programming needs to be designed to facilitate this  
interaction with the learner’s environment by employing suitable production  
techniques and technology, and by developing situations and settings that foster  
interpersonal connection.  
You might wish to explore innovative seating arrangements that provide more  
eye contact between attendees and interaction with presenters. You might select  
seminar formats that give the audience more opportunity to contribute to the  
content or share their opinions and personal experiences. Scheduling of sessions  
might be adjusted to allow more time for “in the hall” interaction or lounge  
areas might be set up for attendees to gather and reflect on the information they  
have acquired. Social networking technology has become ubiquitous, so consider  
incorporating that into the design of the learning activities. Appetite  
21  
Diversion and Recreation  
Interactive activities and amusements are often used to please both the guest and  
the guest’s guest, such as companion programs during a convention or optional  
tours and sports activities during an incentive program. Recreational activities  
are usually included at company picnics, corporate team-building programs, and  
reunion outings. Fairs and festivals frequently include interactive games and rides  
interspersed with the food stalls, exhibits, and other entertainment.  
Active people such as baby boomers and generation Xers want activity and adven-  
ture. They want something to do. It is important to arrange for suitable recreational  
activities and meaningful diversions. You might consider incorporating a charitable  
project into a corporate training conference, such as organizing the painting ofa  
community center during the free afternoon. You can add cultural enrichment to the  
optional tour offerings by organizing a visit to an artist’s studio or an exhibi-  
tion planning session at an anthropology museum. Help the attendees to become  
immersed in the experience, and it will become truly memorable.  
# Appetite  
Food and beverage constitute an integral part of an event experience—any event  
experience. There is always some type of refreshment at an event, even if it is simply  
a water station in a meeting room or at an outdoor athletic event \(see Figure 1.9\).  
Food service must be incorporated into the event plan so that it meets the needs of  
the guests and serves the purpose of the event. It should never be an afterthought.  
Consider the comment of a disgruntled guest leaving a hospitality reception after  
seeing the long lines at the buffet\: “Even free food is only worth so much.”  
Nutrition, Nurturing, and Human Nature  
As dining etiquette expert Margaret Visser \(1991, 171\) asserts, “Eating together is  
a potent expression of community.” Food is a symbol of nurturing. It is synonymous  
with most social gatherings. The food and beverages served at an event should be

Checklist 22 Anatomy of an Event  
nutritious, but they must feed both the body and the soul. Despite the current  
emphasis on a healthy lifestyle, it seems everyone still wants a luscious and rich  
dessert at a banquet.  
The event experience relies on utilizing all five senses. This provides an oppor-  
tunity to heighten the sense of taste and smell through the menu design for any  
event. However, you should not discount the importance of how the food looks  
and sounds. The presentation should be pleasing to the eye as well as the palate,  
and the textures of the food should be consistent with freshness and form—a  
fresh apple should be crunchy and a chocolate mousse should be smooth.  
It is critically important to pay attention to the physical needs and restrictions  
that accompany food and beverage selection. You must determine whether guests  
or attendees have particular food allergies or dietary restrictions—physical, philo-  
sophical, or religious. The last thing you want is to have someone rushed to the  
hospital in anaphylactic shock because a life-threatening allergy to nuts was trig-  
gered by the peanut oil used in a recipe. Collect the information you need, from  
both the attendees and the chef, and be prepared to offer appropriate options.  
Also keep in mind that water and other fluids should always be available at any  
and every event and that alcohol service will usually have regulatory requirements.  
Meals to Match the Occasion  
Menu selection is a dimension in which the professional event coordinator can  
exercise considerable creativity. The menu can influence the entire theme or  
tone of an event. Hot dogs, hamburgers, and beans would signify a casual atmo-  
sphere; chateaubriand and Cherries Jubilee suggest a formal dining experience.  
The fun part is that these two menus can be switched to add a surprising twist  
to an event.  
The type and style of an event will determine the direction to be taken in  
planning the menu. Athletes at a sports event will probably require different foods  
than guests at a wedding reception. Attendees at a multiday conference, having  
all their meals on-site, will want something different for lunch and dinner each  
day. Incentive winners enjoying an exotic destination expect to try the local cui-  
sine. Menus based on an ethnic cuisine or historical record can add authenticity  
to a theme event. Indigenous ingredients will add a flavorful feature for those  
experiencing a new locale. Certain food items are closely associated with specific  
occasions, such as wedding and birthday cakes, or certain rituals, such as matzo at  
the Seder dinner at Passover.  
Concessions, Catering, or Bring Your Own  
Different events require different food and beverage purveyors. Concession  
stands are completely appropriate for public festivals, but probably not for Appetite  
23  
an upscale hospitality reception, unless, of course, they fit with the theme.  
Concessionaires might operate out of permanent facilities within a venue or  
from temporary facilities at an event site. Some have exclusive or specific licens-  
ing or franchise agreements with a venue. However, the professional event  
coordinator should make certain that any purveyor is fully licensed and carries  
appropriate insurance.  
Caterers can provide anything from a lavish 12-course banquet to a back-  
yard barbecue. Many facilities, particularly hotels and convention centers, have  
exclusive in-house food service providers that the professional event coordina-  
tor must use. Other facilities have preferred caterers, usually catering firms that  
have provided excellent references to the facility and excellent service to their  
users. Again, the professional event coordinator must verify that the caterer is  
fully licensed and insured, as well as qualified to handle the scope and type of  
event being planned.  
Most facilities and professional caterers have restrictions on what the client or  
guest may bring to the event for consumption, because of liability concerns, but  
compromise is often possible. Of course, picnics, socials, and private events are a  
natural for the “potluck,” with guests bringing their favorite dishes to share with  
everyone, but make sure you have removed yourself from legal liability.  
Beverages are another matter. The serving of alcohol is strictly regulated in  
most places. The professional event coordinator must become familiar with the  
rules and regulations in a jurisdiction before making any arrangements regarding  
alcohol service. Some places are more restrictive than others regarding licenses and  
liability issues; some locations prohibit alcohol altogether.  
If serving alcohol, the professional event coordinator can incorporate the drink  
menu into the theme or event experience. Martini bars serving flavored martinis  
or drinks poured through an elaborate ice sculpture can become an interesting and  
decorative focus to an event. Wine tasting can be the main attraction for a fund-  
raiser. Serving local wines at a banquet can celebrate the site and opens up sponsor-  
ship opportunities.  
Other beverages present occasions for creativity as well. Fruit smoothies are  
fun for tropical themes or health-oriented events. Restaurant patrons are often  
offered a selection of flavored teas, so why not at an event? Flavored coffees and  
coffee drinks are very popular at a broad spectrum of events; in fact, such fare has  
become an experience industry unto itself.  
Serving with Style  
How the food and beverages are served can significantly affect the event experience.  
\(Even free food is only worth so much.\) There are countless ways to serve food and  
beverages\: massive or minuscule buffet stations, cafeteria lines, waitpersons placing  
course after course in front of diners, platters placed family-style on the table, 24 Anatomy of an Event  
buckets of shellfish and barrels of beer, or hors\\d’oeuvres placed on cascading levels  
of a Southern belle’s hoop skirt. .  
Food service can determine and improve the choreography and flow of an event.  
A variety of food stations can help move guests through an event space and encour-  
age networking. A food court can create trade show traffic in a remote area of  
an exhibition hall. Butlers passing trays of edibles and champagne add glamour  
to a charity reception without taking up floor space for food stations. Gourmet  
box lunches can accompany participants on a tour of the destination or feed  
executives in a strategic planning meeting. Certain civic festivals are all about  
food, and attendees wander from booth to booth tasting the best a city’s restaurant  
community has to offer.  
Palate and Pocketbook  
Food choices are based on the palate and the pocketbook. The professional event  
coordinator must establish the budgetary and dietary parameters with the host or  
client. Certain groups will be hungry for a gastronomical adventure, whereas  
others will not respond to a locality’s spicy cuisine and subdued choices will have  
to be offered. The chef should be able to design a menu full of flavor that will  
delight the taste buds and still reflect the theme cuisine.  
Kendall Collier, CSEP, of Magic Moments, Inc. in Norcross, Georgia, notes that  
menu items requiring a great deal of preparation will be far more expensive  
than those more easily prepared and served, and the style of service requested and  
the location of the event will determine the number of requisite waitstaff that  
must be paid for. To save money at a welcome reception, you might select fewer  
hors d’oeuvre items but in greater volume. Perhaps you will eliminate the dessert  
from the luncheon at the conference and serve it during the afternoon break.  
You might choose the food vendors for a street fair so that there will be a variety  
of food and beverage choices as well as price points. There are always options to  
overcome the challenges of a tight budget or a finicky palate.  
# Amenities  
Once the event is over, all that is left are the memories. These memories can be  
enhanced through the employment of layers of detail and numerous tokens of  
acknowledgment and appreciation \(see Figure 1.10\). These details do not neces-  
sarily need to be costly; they just need to be thoughtful. These are the niceties and  
features of the event experience that add to the comfort of the guest and provide  
a physical reminder of the experience after the event. Amenities

Walk-Away Value  
An event is an ephemeral thing. There is no lasting substance to it without some-  
thing physical one walks away with, so the professional event coordinator should  
always find something for the attendees or guests to take away. Meeting and con-  
ference attendees might be given a USB flash drive loaded with all the conference  
presentations and handouts. Visitors to a tourism event can be given programs  
with information on the destination. Guests at a corporate hospitality function  
can be given logo-imprinted mementos. Award winners should be given custom-  
ized trophies, certificates, or plaques.  
These walk-away items may be given away or may be revenue-generating prod-  
ucts. Many conferences and conventions provide audiotapes of the various ses-  
sions for sale at and after the events. Many also provide or sell custom-imprinted  
tote bags for the session materials and marketing materials collected at a trade  
show. Name badge holders have become fashion items, featuring zippered pockets  
for event tickets, room keys, and business cards. Lanyards for badges are woven  
with a sponsor's logo or the event name and date.  
Legacy Items  
Prizes, gifts, mementos, and souvenirs are the physical items that the attendee or  
guest will keep to remember the event experience. The more substantial and appro-  
priate the item, the longer the legacy will be. Most sporting events offer an expansive  
assortment of team-oriented souvenirs for sale at the venue and year-round at sport-  
ing goods outlets. Nearly all festivals sell commemorative clothing or posters, and  
some sell or give out commemorative drinking cups to support recycling objectives.

Checklist 26 Anatomy of an Event  
Volunteers might be given jackets, caps, or commemorative lapel pins to show  
appreciation for their contribution to the success of an event. Incentive winners  
could be treated to expensive pillow gifts, indigenous to the locale, each night of  
their trip. Participants in a marathon or walk-a-thon could receive T-shirts embla-  
zoned with the event name and sponsor logos. Anniversary dinner guests might  
find a framed menu at their place settings, or the napkins might be imprinted  
with a photo of the happy couple.  
Showing You Care  
There are thousands of ways you can show you care about the guest or attendee’s  
experience. Full-size logo-imprinted tablets and pens on the tables at a meet-  
ing or educational session show attention to detail. Speakers and special guests  
appreciate welcome baskets with some tasty treats and simple souvenirs in their  
guest rooms. Souvenir sunglasses are great for a beach party. Colorful imprinted  
hand towels are a wonderful touch for a golf tournament. Something as simple as  
bottled water with a custom label will be noted and appreciated by participants  
in a parade or on a photo safari. Custom labels on wine bottles will add a special  
touch to a charity banquet; they can even be engraved with the event logo.  
You might have noted that many of these amenities are excellent candidates for  
sponsorship and opportunities for sponsor recognition. As a professional event  
coordinator, you should always find ways to integrate the event’s marketing objec-  
tives into the event elements.  
Personalize the Experience  
Capturing and incorporating the attendee’s or guest’s image in a souvenir or  
memento will put the person in the context of the experience. A photographer  
strolling through an event is standard at social gatherings and virtually mandatory  
at any marketing event. The photograph of the company president presenting the  
employee of the year with his or her award will go in the company newsletter, and  
a framed copy will go on the winner’s wall.  
Many theme events include a photo station where guests can have their  
images inserted into an appropriate setting via a digital camera or have their  
portraits done, dressed in appropriate slip-on costumes. Caricature artists are  
always popular. Commemorative newspapers or magazine covers can be printed  
with funny headlines or posed pictures taken with a video camera. Wanted post-  
ers can be created by digitally capturing the guest’s image with a Web camera  
and then electronically pasting it into a customized poster designed with a space  
for the digital desperado’s image. How about hopping on a Harley Davidson  
motorcycle to have a picture taken at a Route 66 reception or in the winner’s  
circle at a road rally? Wrap Up  
27  
Many private life-cycle events such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and  
casual wedding events provide a disposable camera at every table for guests to  
take candid photos during the festivities. These and other photographs may be  
scanned and put up on a private, controlled-access event Web site for all the  
guests to see and download as desired. Conference photographers often have  
their work processed quickly and offer the pictures for sale at events. Trade show  
exhibitors sponsoring a convention reception may have the photos taken at the  
party available for pickup at their exhibit the following day, ensuring that the  
guests will come by and see their displays.  
Wrap Up  
Professional event coordination is a complex job that encompasses a broad scope  
of responsibilities and opportunities. The professional event coordinator must  
conduct the necessary research to determine the purpose, goals, and objectives  
of an event. He or she must examine all potential elements of an event to deter-  
mine which are necessary, appropriate, or advantageous, and which should be  
incorporated into the event plan.  
The professional event coordinator will work with the host or client to  
develop a strategy for creating and coordinating a comprehensive event experi-  
ence. Every event should be designed to incorporate the six critical dimensions  
of an experience, including anticipation, arrival, atmosphere, activity, appetite,  
and amenities.  
All facets, components, and elements of an event are interdependent. The  
professional event coordinator merges each component and its inherent logistics  
together with all the others and facilitates a smooth and seamless operation. Each  
dimension of the event experience is crafted to support the whole and is designed  
to meet the needs, wants, and expectations of the consumer.

# Creating  
the Event Plan  
We are not just project managers; we are creating  
and staging experiences for real people in  
ae\} red time.  
—Steve Brown, Australian event designer  
in this chapter you will learn how to\:  
Determine the purpose, prioritized goals and objectives, and  
expected outcomes of an event.  
Specify the scope, concept, components, and feasibility of an event  
project.  
Assess the needs, available resources, and constraints of an event  
project.  
Develop specifications for standards of quality, time, cost, and effort.  
Determine the logical sequencing of activity and develop efficient  
schedules.  
31 s the event coordinator and her husband were walking through a large festival,  
enjoying the sights and sounds, watching the action and the audience, her hus-  
band commented on the sheer size of the event, marveling at what it must have taken  
to put all this together. The event coordinator smiled at her husband and said, “Honey,  
it’s just a longer list”  
86 8 oO eH OB RB HR ESE KA KRG SYS YER EEE EEE . oe 8 EWE Y CHO HEH ROH HE as \* «+ 6 \* + . eettpeaenreve eves \:  
Event coordination is all about “the list’—what goes on the list and why. Event  
coordination is the visualization, organization, and synchronization of the event  
elements and the tasks required to implement them. To create that list, you, as the  
professional event coordinator, must define the purpose of the event and analyze  
all the desires, demands, assumptions, and constraints involved to determine the  
products, materials, services, activities, and suppliers to be included in the event  
project. You will not need to include every component discussed in this book in  
every event, but you should consider each to ensure you deliver an event that meets  
the needs and expectations of those attending and investing in the experience.  
Defining the Event  
As shown in Figure 2.1, you might think of the event in terms of three “tents” —  
the intent \(purpose\), the extent \(scope\), and the content \(program\). This con-  
ceptualization is transformed into the event plan through project management  
techniques such as scope definition and project planning. Scope definition is  
derived from the identified need, request, or requirement for the event, the  
product \(event\) analysis, and the feasibility analysis. The output of this becomes  
the project deliverables and is then used to shape the project plan that specifies  
the structure and scheduling of the tasks required to deliver the event. There  
are references to project management throughout this chapter, because using  
project management as a discipline will help you consistently coordinate events  
of any size or context efficiently and effectively.  
Purpose, Goals, and Objectives  
You must determine expectations so that you can define the scope and the speci-  
fications that result in an event that satisfies the customer's needs and desires. It  
is critical that you work with your client to specify the goals and objectives for  
the event and to put them in a prioritized hierarchy \(see Figure 2.2\). You must Defining the Event

clarify what the client is trying to attain, achieve, or accomplish. The client  
might not be able to articulate this immediately or succinctly. You might need  
to probe for the stated objectives, the unstated objectives, the hard objectives,  
and the soft objectives.  
Wouldn't it be great if all event goals and objectives were so precise and the  
expectations so well defined as Patrick Delaney’s On-Site Insight on page 34?  
Unfortunately, this is not always the case. More often, the task is to help cli-  
ents put their needs and desires into words, probing to determine what they  
mean by what they say. If you are coordinating a fiftieth birthday celebration,  
does your client want specific people in attendance? If you are coordinating a  
corporate event, are there measurable areas of market share growth expected?  
If you are coordinating a festival or association event, are there particular  
constituencies that must be served? If you are coordinating a sponsored event,  
what are the sponsors’ marketing objectives?

# INSIGHT  
Ree craratent ert —  
Penick Benner, CITE, partner and CEO of Ovation eras an award-winning  
destination management company in Dublin, Ireland, specializing in incen-  
tive events, notes that hard objectives for incentive programs include  
increased sales, increased profits, product awareness, and raised productiv-  
ity. Soft objectives include camaraderie and team bonding, peer recognition,  
company loyalty, and education or training. For incentive programs, the hard  
objectives are linked to very specific and measurable targets that the winner  
must have met in order to receive the incentive travel award. Therefore, the  
events included in the incentive travel program must be worthy of the effort  
required to win; they must be exceptional and something the winners could  
not have orchestrated on their own.  
To put this in perspective, suppose you are coordinating a conference for your  
professional association. The costs to a delegate might include a registration fee  
of \$600, an airline ticket at \$500, a hotel room at \$600 \(4 nights \* \$150/night\),  
and meals, business center services, and other incidentals could add up to \$400.  
Add to that \$900 for a week away from work \(a factor all too many organizers  
ignore\), and the cost to the delegate could easily be \$3,000 or more. To achieve  
a positive return on investment, the delegate will have to come away from that  
conference with a \$3,000 idea.  
Goals and objectives must not only be defined, they must be measurable. \(How  
will you know if you have delivered that \$3,000 idea?\) The acronym SMART,  
devised by George Doran in 1981, illustrates the qualities required of goal and  
objective statements.  
Specific Assignable Realistic Must be specific in targeting an objective  
Measurable Must have a measurable indicator\(s\) of progress/success  
Must be capable of being assigned to someone to accomplish  
Must be realistic within allotted resources  
Time-related Must have a specified duration  
As marketing consultant Robert Middleton \(2002\) advises, “You cannot assume  
what success would look like. You have to ask. You have to get specific answers.”  
These specific answers need to include measurement specifications. Measurement  
is becoming increasingly important as events are under increasing scrutiny due to  
perceptions of impropriety or questionable use of funds. The ability to measure  
success is inextricably linked with the criteria and specifications developed in the Defining the Event  
35  
initial stages of an event project, as well as the evaluation of the event’s successes  
and its weaknesses or failures during and at the close of the project \(to be dis-  
cussed further in Chapter 14\).  
To measure is to compare something against a relative criterion such as amount,  
capacity, capability, level, limit, degree, or other standard. To begin you need to  
determine the temporal \(time\), dimensional \(size\), numerical \(quantity\), cate-  
gorical \(type\), financial \(money\), physical \(effort\), and proportional \(allotment\)  
magnitude and boundaries associated with the event project. This influences the  
acquisition and allocation of resources for the event and the valuation of its out-  
comes \(e.g., accuracy, usefulness, importance, worth, etc.\).  
This is often discussed in terms of return on investment \(ROJ\) or return on  
objectives \(ROO\), and applies to the corporate world as well as to associations,  
governments, charitable organizations, leisure and entertainment organizations,  
and private individuals. You must seek a definitive description of the return  
expected for the investment made. Without the goals and objectives specified, you  
will not be able to describe the results expected. You will not be able to define the  
scope of the project, specify the scope of your responsibilities, control the extent  
of your obligations, nor evaluate your success.  
In addition, event coordinators invariably encounter the “could-you-just”  
syndrome—“Could you just add candles to the centerpieces?” “Could you just  
have your people put up these flags behind the dais?” “Could you just change  
those table linens from red to blue?” The client keeps adding or changing one  
more thing, and one more thing, and one more thing, expecting there to be no  
change in the resources provided. \(Changing the linen color, even if feasible,  
could involve numerous telephone calls, various pieces of paperwork, perhaps  
even additional costs.\) In project management this is called scope creep—the  
scope of the project keeps creeping outward. Without establishing clear param-  
eters and objectives, you will not be able to identify the appropriate event  
elements, sequence the tasks efficiently, or effectively manage the resources for  
the event.  
How do you determine the prioritized goals and objectives? You ask. You probe.  
You listen. Using a comprehensive Client Interview Form \(see Appendix 1\) and  
a consultative selling process, you keep challenging the client, in a nice way, to  
define the guest reaction and/or results expected. Once the list of goals and objec-  
tives is established \(with the measurement of success defined\), you must work  
with the client to rank them in order of precedence and preference. You need to  
determine which event elements are absolutely necessary, which will enhance the  
event significantly, and which would simply be nice to have. This information will  
be critical when you begin to analyze feasibility and find that you must ask the  
client, who wants the sun, the moon, and the stars, to decide whether he or she  
wants the sun, the moon, or the stars. 36 Creating the Event Plan  
Identifying the Needs  
Need is a complex term. People do not buy an airline ticket because they need  
an airline ticket—what they need is to be in Pittsburgh on Friday or in Paris on  
Tuesday. You must remember that you are not just taking an order. You are craft-  
ing a solution to what the client truly needs.  
Defining needs is a critical component of the ability to deliver a successful  
event. Needs, however, are not always apparent or fully considered. “I need a  
wedding reception” is certainly not enough to direct your design and delivery of a  
reception event for this client. It is definitely not enough to ensure that the event  
you coordinate will be a success, even if you have coordinated hundreds of other  
wedding receptions. Answers to Rudyard Kipling’s “six honest serving men’—  
why, who, where, when, what, and how—are the source for the information to be  
included in a needs assessment.  
¢ WHY—The purpose of the event is the foundation that drives all other deci-  
sions about its scope and the event elements to be included.  
\* WHO—The audience or guest profile and volume must be defined.  
\* WHERE and WHEN—Provide the logistical parameters as well as creative  
opportunities.  
¢ WHAT—Determine the event context, content, and mandate.  
\* HOW and HOW MUCH—Specify how much in the way of resources will be  
required and how the resources will be allocated.  
Additional questions you should ask to help you identify and prioritize the  
event elements to be included might be the following\:  
e¢ What must be done?  
e¢ What should be done?  
¢ What can be done?  
¢ Is it doable?  
¢ Is it affordable?  
° Is it meaningful?  
It is critical to remember that there are conditions and consequences that come  
with every potential event element that must be considered. Each element has or  
can have an impact on virtually every other element. As when pebbles are dropped  
into a still pool of water, ripples expand out in all directions. Selecting a theme  
for a party will drive decisions about the invitations, site selection, décor, food and  
beverages, entertainment, and party favors. Selecting pin spots to highlight the  
centerpieces on the banquet tables will affect the timing of when the tables can and  
must be positioned and dressed \(the lights must be rigged before the tables are  
positioned, and then focused after the tables have been positioned and dressed\). Identifying the Needs 37

Ira L. Rosen, CFEE, president and CEO of Point Pleasant, New Jersey-based Entertainment On Location, Inc., advises that one-of-a-kind events always present unique challenges to the event producer, since they've never been  
done before and they will never be done again. “I have had the opportunity to  
be a part of many of these events, including the Bicentennial of the Constitu-  
tion, the Bicentennial of the Presidency, the Millennium celebrations, and one  
of my personal favorites, my alma mater’s Centennial festival.”  
In September of 2008, Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, New  
Jersey, culminated its year-long Centennial celebration with a day-long  
family-oriented festival. Some of the challenges Rosen's team faced included  
meeting the needs of a variety of constituencies \(students, alumni, com-  
munity, faculty, families, University administration, etc.\), working within  
| |  
a governmental purchasing and procurement system, limited financial  
resources, and many others.  
Research, the first phase in the five-phase development process \(Goldblatt  
2008\), was fundamental because the University \(obviously\) had never done  
a Centennial event before. “We researched what other universities had done  
for this type of celebration, and as expected, it ranged from multi-thousand-  
H  
dollar extravaganzas to punch and cookies for next to nothing.”  
Neither of these models fit, so they decided on the festival concept |  
with a broad variety of entertainment, amusement rides, educational |  
activities, Community and not-for-profit booths, make-and-take art proj- |  
ects for children, and a number of other key elements. The end result  
| was a cost-effective, yet fun celebration of a key milestone for the uni-  
versity that thousands of guests enjoyed.

The professional event coordinator must examine the customers, capabilities, and  
competition in a comprehensive manner in order to create an effective event plan.  
# Customers  
The marketing mantra “know your customer” is as applicable in event design  
and coordination as in any marketing realm. There are, however, many different  
customers you must serve during an event. There will be clients, users \(guests and  
attendees\), and numerous other stakeholders and influencers to consider. Each  
will have an impact on the event elements to be included. 38 Creating the Event Plan

Silvers’ Event Guest  
Profiler  
Create a customer profile for each constituency you will need to serve,  
including demographics, lifestyle and life stage, purchase stimulus, and ben-  
efits sought. The profile of each of these customer groups will reveal needs and  
desires that should be factored into the event element analysis and plan. For  
example, you might use a generational marketing consumer profile, such as  
shown in Figure 2.3, when determining the features and activities for a tourism  
festival or convention program. Understanding these generational differences  
also applies to communicating with and serving your target markets \(and your  
event personnel\).  
As Hogg \(2010\) advises\:  
Event organizers who plan continual events that will happen every year over a period  
of time need to do so across multiple years as the demographics change. They need  
to start to look at the infrastructure and direction the event is currently in, where  
it will be based on the generational divide, and then plan accordingly. Think stra-  
tegically when looking at the event components and the tools, resources, and  
interactions \(professional, personal, and social\) because you will have a differ-  
ent demographic market in less than five to ten years guided by new customers,  
decision makers, and suppliers who embrace different types of communications, Identifying the Needs  
39  
socialization, and technologies. Everything needs to be tailored to the segmentation  
within the larger demographics slowly over a period of time until a certain level of  
stability is maintained until the next generation shift, while maintaining current ele-  
ments that are appropriate to the specific demographic at the same event. The new  
elements must be in budget, in contracts, and in line with the mission, goals, and  
objectives of the event.  
You must also be sensitive to and respect the cultural differences within a given  
community or society and in other cultures. These differences might be based  
in religion; ethnic background; historical tradition; and national, geographical,  
or organizational customs. The constituencies to consider include the attendees,  
participants, hosting organization or community, and other stakeholders that are  
important to the success and sustainability of the event. Recognizing and address-  
ing such differences prevents giving offense, promotes cultural diversity, and is  
mandatory in today’s global economy.  
The planning implications encompass such things as scheduling \(holidays,  
holy days, protocol, etc.\); dietary needs and restrictions; the environment \(color  
usage, personal space requirements, and symbols or emblems\); and etiquette  
issues \(dress codes, gestures, interaction, etc.\) \(Silvers 2008, 64\). In particular,  
you must consider conflicts associated with the dates or event sites under consid-  
eration. Certain secular holidays or local celebrations often affect the availability  
of resources or levels of service at a particular site. Religious affiliations often affect  
the suitability of certain dates or time periods, thereby affecting attendance and  
attitudes about the event hosting organization.  
Capabilities  
The capabilities you must consider include your ability to handle the event in its  
proposed scope and context, the availability of products and services, and the fea-  
tures of the event site. Although the core processes remain the same, coordinating  
a large festival for a civic celebration is different from producing a multicity prod-  
uct launch for a major corporation or the perfect wedding celebration. Each event  
context will have its own set of parameters and a specialized body of knowledge.  
You need to be completely honest with yourself and your client about your ability  
to deliver the event required and desired.  
There are often constraints specific to the type of event or event audience,  
including legal or regulatory constraints that limit the locations that may be  
used, the activities that may be included, the content that must be included,  
or the vendors that may be used. For example, events involving interaction  
between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers in the United  
States now have restrictions that affect sponsorships, meals, and in some cases  
the content of educational events. 40 Creating the Event Plan  
The site selected for the event also involves capabilities that must be examined.  
These present a set of constraints, as well as creative possibilities, to be incorpo-  
rated into your event design and implementation strategy. The event site and/or  
venue is a key component of a needs assessment, and in determining the elements  
that must, should, and could be included in the event. Additional site issues and  
implications are discussed in depth in Chapter 3.  
# Competition  
Considering the competition includes a determination of what will be competing  
with your event for the time, money, and emotional investment of the attendees  
or guests. If you are coordinating a fundraising event, you will want to ensure that  
it is not scheduled at the same time as other charity functions competing for the  
same patrons. If you are coordinating a festival designed to increase tourism to  
your area, you will need to evaluate the assets of other tourism destinations and  
events. If you are coordinating an incentive event for Volkswagen at an exotic des-  
tination, you can be assured that the company does not want it in the same place  
and at the same time when Toyota is there.  
You might also need to consider the situation of a single event within an entire  
event program. What else will be happening before, concurrently, and after the  
event? If the event you are coordinating is a hospitality reception in conjunction  
with a conference or convention, you will want to know what other receptions  
will be taking place and when, as well as where this reception fits into the overall  
agenda. You may be responsible for only this one reception, but you want it to  
become part of the overall event experience, as well as achieve the attendance  
expectations of the host client.  
The Comprehensive Perspective  
The event experience must be considered from threshold to threshold and con-  
sidered from the guests’ point of view. Drawing on your experience with previ-  
ous and similar events, as well as the history of this or comparable events, you  
identify the event elements that will deliver the required results to the client and  
the desired benefits to the attendee. You then examine the implications of each  
element within the overall plan. \(See Figure 2.4.\)  
An event does not happen in a vacuum. You must include a comprehensive  
perspective of your different customers, plus the internal and external stakehold-  
ers, in analyzing their needs, wants, and mandates. Depending on the event type,  
the stakeholders or influencers you can be dealing with could include corporate  
executives, boards of directors, sponsors, family members, public bureaucrats, or  
regulatory officials. You must conduct a situational assessment of the macro- and  
microenvironments in which the event takes place. Macroenvironments include Reports

Creating the Event Plan  
the economy, community and constituent sociocultural demographics, and govern-  
mental influence. Microenvironments include industry-specific factors, competitive  
forces, and supply and demand. Failure to scan these environments and identify the  
needs of internal and external stakeholders can cause problems when it comes time  
to move in and set up, not to mention contributing significantly to scope creep.  
Analyzing Resources  
Once needs are identified and the prioritized goals and objectives established, you  
must blend creativity with practicality. You must identify the resources and any obsta-  
cles to determine the practicality of the project and the potential for success. Resources  
include time, money, personnel, information, space, and service availability. Each one  
of these can be an advantage or become an obstacle. You must make sure that you  
have a reasonable balance of resources to allocate to achieve the event requirements.  
Management is allocating, directing, and controlling resources to achieve  
objectives. A feasibility analysis shows the viability of achieving success—the out-  
come envisioned by the client—by defining the event elements and requirements  
and putting them into the context of the reality of available resources. Resources,  
by definition, are limited. The professional event coordinator must balance the  
“need” with the “have,” making sure that what must be done can be done with  
the resources available for the event project \(see Figure 2.5\).  
You must be brutally realistic about the quantity and quality of the resources  
committed to the event project. Insufficient resources in one area may be miti-  
gated by additional resources of another type—for example, less time = more  
personnel, insufficient number of volunteers = more money for support staffing.  
Meetings industry technology expert Corbin Ball, CSP, CMP, MS, of Corbin Ball  
Associates, advises that there are technologies available that can facilitate or auto-  
mate many aspects, thereby reducing the level requirements of certain resources  
\(see Figure 2.6\). However, if there are insufficient resources all around, the scope  
of the event might have to be reduced. You must calculate the realistic likelihood  
of achieving the level of success expected.

# Time  
Of all the resources at your disposal, time is the one resource that is finite. When  
clients really want something that is not included in the budget, there are usually  
ways to find more money to make it happen. When money is short, volunteer  
personnel can often fill in the gap. When space is limited, creative options such as  
adding a tented area are often possible. But when you have run out of time, you  
have run out of time. You cannot beg, borrow, or steal more.  
This is the primary difference between event project management and other  
realms of project management. The event's date, which is virtually always fixed, not  
flexible, is the starting point of project time management, rather than the project  
management process determining the completion date. Time restrictions will  
determine the tempo of the event project.  
# Money  
Monetary resources must be allocated carefully. It is important to remember  
that everything will cost something. Goods and services require labor and mate-  
rials. Volunteers and donated items will incur administrative and hospitality Analyzing Resources  
45  
costs. Securing more money through sponsorships, gifts, and grants will have  
costs attached. Even assessing needs and analyzing event resources take time,  
and time is money. Nothing is free. The more limited the budget, the more  
focused you must be on the event goals, but a quality event does not depend on  
a large budget.  
The budget is a planning tool as well as a road map. It specifies how financial  
resources should and will be apportioned throughout the event project according  
to need and priority. It should also serve as a benchmark or trigger for decision  
making for choices such as site selection, pricing structures, or the inclusion or  
cancellation of event components. Except for very rare instances, there is no such  
thing as an unlimited budget, even if the client says “cost is no object.” You must  
validate the budget and the availability of additional money if required.  
Personnel  
Your human resources might include part-time or full-time paid staff, casual or  
temporary labor, and/or a volunteer corps. Depending on the type of event, these  
human resources are secured through recruitment, hired through various agen-  
cies, or provided by the sponsoring organization. Your human resources must be  
assessed based on experience and expertise, as well as their availability within the  
schedule requirements.  
You must assess the quantity and capabilities of volunteers and other labor  
resources. Workforce planning includes identifying the tasks to be completed, the  
skills required to perform those tasks, and the appropriate number of personnel  
to accomplish those tasks. Specify the work breakdown structure and analyze the  
schedule to be certain that what needs to be accomplished can be accomplished  
within the time constraints by the personnel available.  
# Space  
Virtually everything needed to make the event come to life will have spatial  
requirements. These requirements could include the space required for the  
equipment to be used as well as the space needed for those using it. They might  
include space for installation and maintenance access, operational or proximity  
specifications, ceiling heights and sightlines, or safety boundaries. Space will also  
be needed for the people at the event, both those in attendance as audience or  
participants and as workers.  
The laws of the physical world prohibit two people or two things from occupy-  
ing the same space at the same time. Therefore the event plan must combine the  
schedule with the site plan and the budget to ensure that spatial needs are met,  
spatial constraints are overcome, and spatial conflicts are eliminated. 46 Creating the Event Plan  
Suppliers  
The world has gotten much smaller through the various forms of new com-  
munications technology, and vendors and suppliers to the event industry have  
embraced this opportunity by expanding their geographic markets. However, not  
all products and services are available or affordably accessible in all parts of the  
world. You must know what you can and cannot reasonably obtain in your area  
and through your supplier resources.  
Goods and services come in all shapes, sizes, and levels of quality, effort, and  
cost. The event plan must stipulate the specifications for all those items and ser-  
vices to be procured for the event project. If suitable products, services, tech-  
nologies, or providers are not available or affordable, alternative options must be  
developed or planned activities must be adjusted.  
Delegation and Direction  
The professional event coordinator must always work within a team, even if he or  
she is a sole, independent practitioner. There are always vendors, suppliers, sup-  
port staff, and volunteers or helpers involved in an event project. Their numbers  
can range from a few family members and a couple of suppliers to the thousands  
of vendors and 1.7 million volunteers and nearly 10,000 staff members for the  
2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China.  
Big jobs are accomplished by completing small tasks. Utilizing these staffing  
and vendor resources requires delegation and proper direction. The professional  
event coordinator maintains the focus on the big picture and delegates the task  
assignments. Project management consultant James P. Lewis \(1997, 105\) notes,  
however, that “delegation does not mean abdication.” Well-trained, experi-  
enced personnel may be utilized because they are usually more cost-effective,  
yet everyone, including professionals, will need direction. There will be lots of  
pieces to the puzzle, and the event coordinator is the one who knows what the  
final picture should look like.  
Logical Sequencing  
Two of Stephen Covey’s Seven Habits of Highly Effective People are to “begin with  
the end in mind” and to “put first things first.” These could arguably be the essence  
of the logistics and logical sequencing of the event elements. There will be a natu-  
ral order and a necessary order in which the various event elements \(and the tasks  
associated with them\) will have to be chronologically organized. Certain event ele-  
ments and tasks will have to be sequential and others are simultaneous, and many  
of the controlling and monitoring processes of event coordination are iterative. Logical Sequencing  
47  
Logical sequencing follows a critical path, meaning that some tasks will be  
dependent on other tasks having already been completed, and some tasks will  
be affected by the way in which others have been done. Developing the logical  
sequencing for an event depends on sound reasoning, collecting the specifica-  
tions, and understanding the interdependencies. In project management, this is  
known as activity sequencing, which will depend on the activity list, mandatory  
dependencies, external dependencies, and milestones \(the completion of major  
and requisite deliverables or tasks\).  
Identify Event Tasks and Activity  
The components of an event project will, of course, depend on the type and scope  
of the event. As you envision the dimensions shown in Figure 2.7 and scan the  
elements in the content row of Figure 2.4, you will identify the features, activities,  
supplies, products, services, and vendors that must go on your list. Each dimen-  
sion, each feature, each product or service will indicate certain characteristics and  
options, as well as additional operational requirements.  
For example, if you decide to include colorful fabrics, spandex, or vinyl  
stretched from a high ceiling to the centers of the buffet displays to indicate their  
positioning within a cavernous space, you will probably need to secure a scissor  
lift or high jacker to install them. You will also have to ensure that the material  
used complies with the fire codes of the particular jurisdiction. In certain jurisdic-  
tions \(e.g., Las Vegas, Nevada\), you must have the installation done by a profes-  
sional rigger from a specific labor union.  
As you visualize the event experience, from threshold to threshold, itemize the  
elements that will or should be included. Then analyze each of these elements  
to determine the products and/or services that will be required for implementa-  
tion, as well as the likely impact they will have on the other elements. You will  
also have to consider the administrative issues, marketing implications, and risk  
management ramifications. The tasks required to bring the event to life must be  
organized according to their necessary and logical flow.

Flowcharts, Outlines, or Storyboards  
A variety of formats may be used to illustrate the flow of the tasks necessary to  
produce the event, including flowcharts, outlines, storyboards, or other graphical  
layouts. In project management, this begins with the work breakdown structure  
\(decomposing the event into its elements and components\), which facilitates cre-  
ating the activity list \(the tasks associated with each element\). You then identify  
the interdependencies to create the activity sequencing and estimate the duration  
of each activity. Project management expert Michael C. Thomsett \(1990, 88-89\)  
suggests the following flowchart rules\:  
° Always use the precedence method. What fits where and when, according to  
what precedes it and what follows it.  
° Make sure the path of activities and events makes sense. Vhe path works when  
it is arranged logically.  
¢ An activity cannot occur until a preceding activity or event has been com-  
pleted. There will likely be numerous concurrent activities that must be  
precedence-connected.  
° Carefully plot, explain, and control concurrent events. Vhese concurrent activi-  
ties may have individual flowcharts \(and different team members\) that must  
be supervised carefully.  
° Exercise control over weak links. The flowchart helps you identify the weak  
links in the process that must be monitored.  
The work breakdown structure, activity list, and activity sequencing may be  
composed in an outline form, either a Harvard or numerical outline, or can  
be generated via a mind-mapping technique ora scalar organization \(see Figure 2.8\).  
Some find the storyboard method effective—creating a card for each task and  
arranging the cards in groups and chronological order. You should lock in the  
most important items first, incorporating the chronology, priority, and flexibility  
of each.  
Collect Specifications and Directions  
Once the list of event elements is prepared, the specifications must be deter-  
mined. Consider the quality level or type of product or service that will be  
appropriate for the event style and context. For example, name badges can be  
handwritten on paper badges with sticky backs, printed on card stock \(perhaps  
with a barcode to be scanned\) and inserted in plastic holders, embossed on plas-  
tic cards \(like credit cards\) with large amounts of data imbedded in a magnetic  
strip on the back, or embedded with a radio-frequency identification \(RFID\)  
chip, and can cost anywhere from a few cents apiece to double-digit dollar  
amounts each. Logical Sequencing

Ascertain the installation or implementation requirements for each element.  
You must thoroughly understand what resources will be required for each prod-  
uct or service. For event elements, products, or services associated with disci-  
plines with which you are unfamiliar, collect this information through research,  
your colleagues on the event team \(e.g., scenic designer, catering manager, or  
graphic designer\), or directly from the vendors and suppliers you will be con-  
tracting \(remember, they should also be practicing consultative selling\). Include  
the following specifications\:  
Product—quantity, quality, features, or brand specifications  
Time—fabrication/installation/removal duration; sequence restrictions; materi-  
als and/or information dependencies \(what a vendor needs you to provide  
before it can begin\)

requirements; special permits, compliance instruments, and/or insurance  
requirements

Figure 2.8  
Activity Chart Styles 50 Creating the Event Plan  
Recognize Bottlenecks and Outside Influences  
You must understand what each provider will do, what equipment or materi-  
als each needs to be able to do it, how mich time is needed to do it, and what  
impact that might have on other providers. Of particular note, you will have  
to integrate and synchronize those tasks and those providers who will need to  
be occupying the same or contiguous space or time in the sequence in the  
schedule. When setting up an event on-site, the activity will be fast and furious  
and you must carefully choreograph this delicate dance of possibly hundreds of  
people coming together in the same space at the same time to create, operate,  
and participate in the event experience.  
The event elements must be arranged in order of priority, logistics, and chro-  
nology. Tap into your own experience and the experience of others to recognize,  
anticipate, and alleviate potential congestion and conflict before it can result in  
financial or productivity problems. In project management, this is called project  
integration management, which includes integrated change control.  
Understand the Logistics of a Progressive Experience  
A progressive event experience is an event program that follows a natural or designed  
progression from start to finish or threshold to threshold. Not everything happens  
at once, at least for the individual at the event. At a public festival, for example, there  
might be different activities and amusements scheduled continuously throughout  
the day, and the visitor will be experiencing these attractions one after the other. At  
a conference or convention, there are often numerous concurrent sessions, but the  
delegate can attend only one at a time. During an incentive travel program, there  
will be a balance of sightseeing, social events, free time, and rest.  
This progression, or flow, of the event will indicate additional operational ele-  
ments that must be sequenced logically and logistically as well. The professional  
event coordinator must supervise vendors as they replenish supplies and materials,  
monitor volunteer arrivals and activities, and arrange everything performers or par-  
ticipants will need for their arrival, preparations, waiting, performance, and depar-  
ture throughout the duration of the event program. This might necessitate dressing  
rooms, a green room, and/or break areas for staff, volunteers, cast, and crew.  
The months of preplanning culminate in an event that is often over in just a  
few hours. But the party does not end there. You must remember that the break-  
down and move-out is an essential component of the event production. It must  
have sufficient resources allocated \(i.e., time, money, personnel, etc.\) and must be  
choreographed as carefully as the move-in and the event itself. So I just smile and  
nod when an admiring guest comes up to me during an event and bubbles, “Oh,  
you do parties . . . what fun!” I know that all the hard work was truly invisible  
to the guest. Timelines and Schedules  
51  
Timelines and Schedules  
You have identified the event elements, collected the specifications for each prod-  
uct or provider, and identified the interdependencies. Now you must integrate  
this into a project schedule that includes tracking systems, control points, and  
deadlines to ensure that the schedule is effective. Timelines, production schedules,  
running orders, and scripts should reflect the necessary chronological sequence of  
the delivery and implementation of the goods, services, tasks, and performances  
required to produce the event experience.  
Timeline versus Production Schedule  
The project schedule or timeline should be presented in a chronological format,  
such as through a scroll list or a graphical or schematic chart. The scroll list format  
might be a simple numerical sequence by date \(see Figure 2.9\). The graphical for-  
mat might be a bar chart \(often called a Gantt chart, named for Henry Gantt, who  
developed a complete notational system for showing progress with bar charts in  
the late 1950s\) or a network diagram, often an arrow diagram. \(See Figure 2.10.\)  
The graphical format might also simply be a calendar. To facilitate monitoring  
functions, either the scroll list or graphical format should include the name of the  
person, vendor, or team responsible for each task listed.  
The style or format you use will depend on the complexity of the event project  
and what best communicates the schedule to your event project team. In many  
cases, a combination of formats will be needed for different event elements, such  
as printing, catering, décor, and entertainment. The key for any of these formats  
is to ensure that Task A is done before Task B as needed, and that it is clear which  
tasks must be sequential, which are simultaneous, which are conditional, and  
which are iterative.  
For larger, complex events, the use of project management software will facili-  
tate the event coordination process. This type of software includes the ability to pro-  
vide the project flowcharts, diagrams, schedules, and monitoring checkpoints. For

smaller or one-time events, project management software is often too expensive—  
both the investment for purchasing the software and the investment of learning/  
training time to be able to master it. Standard software will likely suffice for orga-  
nizing and integrating timelines, address files, personal scheduling, word proces-  
sing, spreadsheets, budgeting, basic reports, and graphics.  
As the day of the event nears, the project schedule will shift from the broader  
calendar perspective to a daily and hourly \(or even minute-by-minute\) ver-  
sion. This agenda is called a production schedule and is most often presented

of columns will depend on the type or scope of the event and the information  
necessary to monitor the schedule. Each column will include a qualifying fac-

Production Schedule  
for One Day of a  
Familiarization Trip for  
Incentive Planners at a  
Golf Resort 54 Creating the Event Plan  
vendors or event team members. You might create customized schedules that  
include only the information required by each vendor or group. You might wish  
to print daily versions for each day of a.multiday festival, or you might omit  
certain elements, such as the arrival time of a specific dignitary that should be  
confidential for security reasons. However, as changes are made to the master  
schedule, these updates must be included in the customized versions as well. Also  
remember that you want your entire team to have a clear understanding of the  
event as a whole.  
The schedule may be printed a variety of ways. It can be printed horizon-  
tally or vertically on standard stationery, which would facilitate inclusion in the  
Production Book \(discussed further in Chapter 14\) and/or on a clipboard at the  
receiving dock or registration table. It can be enlarged to poster size and mounted  
on the wall in the on-site headquarters office. It can be downloaded into a PDA  
\(personal digital assistant\) or posted on a company intranet. Again, form follows  
function; the format should facilitate effective communications.  
Reverse Planning to Achieve Realistic Scheduling  
How do you ensure that you will have all the information required to print  
the conference brochure or trade show directory on time? How long can you  
wait to order a customized stage backdrop? How do you establish the entry  
deadline for participants in a road rally? Professional event coordinators learn  
to plan backward. You collect the specifications data and duration estimations  
for all the event elements, integrate the critical path of interdependencies into  
the activity sequence, and establish a deadline for each task. With the deadline  
noted on the calendar or schedule, you move backward on the schedule the  
amount of time it will take to accomplish a particular task to establish the start  
date or time.  
When estimating the time required for each task defined, you must consider  
all constraints, assumptions, capabilities, historical information, and manda-  
tory dependencies \(the tasks that must be completed before another task can  
begin\). You need to determine, from your prior experience and a healthy mea-  
sure of optimistic pessimism, how much time it will actually take to complete  
a task. Although the industry trend is shorter lead times for event preparation,  
try to build plenty of flexibility into your schedule. You should be very con-  
servative when estimating productivity and very generous when anticipating  
problems.  
Once you have the initial drafts of both your timeline and production schedule,  
you should distribute these to your staff, vendors, and/or key stakeholders for review  
and comment. These draft schedules should be distributed as early as possible to  
allow time for any changes or concerns to be addressed and incorporated into the  
final version. Wrap Up  
55  
Tracking and Change Controls  
A carefully crafted schedule is a thing of beauty, but unless it incorporates track-  
ing and control mechanisms, it is next to worthless. In project management you  
use the project schedule with critical path milestones, performance reports, and  
change orders to develop the schedule control system.  
The timeline and production schedule should have the critical milestones and  
deadlines highlighted, including those tasks or activities that must be completed  
before another task may begin. With the responsibility for each task assigned to  
an individual \(remember the “A” of SMART objectives\), regular performance  
updates and critical path reviews should be plotted into the schedule, includ-  
ing written reports and in-person meetings. These reports and meetings must be  
scheduled to allot sufficient time to take corrective action if required. Incorporate  
a tickler system \(to “tickle” your memory\) into your timeline, computer sched-  
uler, and/or personal scheduler system.  
Change controls include the manner of and documentation required for  
making any changes to the project scope or the project schedule. The profes-  
sional event coordinator should develop and utilize a Change Order Form \(see  
Appendix 2\) for changes to the scope of the event project. Change notification  
protocols must be developed to ensure that schedule updates are communicated  
efficiently and effectively.  
Not only are these tracking and change control mechanisms important for  
keeping the event project on time and on track, they will provide valuable infor-  
mation when coordinating your next event project. This is why you should ana-  
lyze and document the causes of any variances, the reasons behind the corrective  
actions selected, and other lessons learned. You should be creating a historical  
database for this event as well as other event projects so that you may continu-  
ously improve your processes and procedures.  
Wrap Up  
The adage, “If you don’t know where you are going, you won't know if you got  
there,” sums up the need for creating a comprehensive event plan based on the  
definitions of success. The professional event coordinator conducts an assessment  
to determine the purpose of and expectations for an event in order to be able to  
visualize, organize, and synchronize the elements and actions required to deliver  
the desired event experience.  
Using the principles and discipline of project management, the professional  
event coordinator will be able to identify, prioritize, and sequence event elements  
and tasks in a comprehensive and successful manner, as well as allocate and control 56  
oes ¢ ee  
Creating the Event Plan  
resources to achieve the event objectives. Resources are always limited and must  
be balanced according to need and reality. The event host or hosting organization  
must be advised what will and will not be possible based on the resources available  
so that other options \(and perhaps opportunities\) may be properly considered.  
The professional event coordinator must create realistic timelines and produc-  
tion schedules that incorporate the interdependencies and critical path of activi-  
ties, as well as manage the risks associated with them. These schedules must be  
validated and verified by the event stakeholders and then distributed to all appro-  
priate personnel and providers. Timely communications and controls are critical  
to the successful achievement of the event goals and objectives.  
REVIEW CHECKPOINTS  
1. How might determining the purpose and expected outcomes of an  
event differ when dealing with private individuals, corporate clients, and  
associations?  
2. How do specifications regarding standards of quality, time, cost, and effort  
affect your ability to conduct a feasibility analysis?  
3. In what ways does event coordination use traditional project management  
techniques?  
4. What factors affect how products, services, and activities are to be sequenced  
in an event?  
5. What is the difference between a timeline and a production schedule, and  
how would you determine the appropriate format for each?  
EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Determine the event elements and create a timeline and production schedule for  
each of the following events. Be sure to include the research, design, planning,  
implementation, and evaluation phases.  
A. Your professional association will be holding its annual convention in your  
city two years from now. It will consist of four days, including 36 concurrent  
seminars, a trade show, a welcome reception, an awards banquet, and three  
days of leadership meetings before the convention begins.  
B. Your Convention and Visitors Bureau wants to hold a three-day Familiarization  
Tour for 50 meeting planners in conjunction with your city’s famous cultural  
heritage festival six months from now. The tour should include a visit to the  
festival, site visits to ten hotel properties and attractions, and meal functions  
at a minimum of six other hotel or resort properties. Wrap Up 57  
C. The city elections took place yesterday, and the newly elected mayor just  
called and wants to hold an impressive investiture ceremony and inaugural  
ball six weeks from now. The ceremony will be in the afternoon and the  
inaugural ball that evening, and both are to include elements that recall  
the campaign issues of supporting youth programs, strong law enforce-  
ment, and community pride.

# Developing  
the Event Site  
No matter where you go—there you are.  
Ea -Confucius, Chinese philosopher \(551-479 BC\)  
In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
Establish site specifications and selection criteria based on the event's  
requirements.  
Identify potential event sites and evaluate their suitability to select  
the best fit for an event.  
Develop site plans that utilize the space in an efficient and effective  
manner to meet the goals and objectives of an event.  
Ensure that the use of the event site is in compliance with all federal,  
state or provincial, and local legislation, health and safety ordinances,  
and other jurisdictional regulations.  
Determine and implement strategies to ensure full accessibility of the  
event site in compliance with legislation for those with disabilities  
and other special needs.  
59 | he event coordinator was standing in a corner watching the action at the client  
I hospitality reception she had designed and organized for a décor rental company. \:  
\~ She had transformed its cavernous warehouse into a fantasy environment by having  
, the space emptied \(the stock was loaded into the company’s large delivery trucks  
for the duration of the event\), draping the walls and perimeter storage racks from floor  
to potas in black, and installing lush carpeting throughout. Props, lighting, decorated  
\_ buffets and well-dressed tables and chairs created various theme areas that illustrated  
the décor company’s capabilities. A colleague approached the coordinator in awe and,  
in all seriousness, asked, “How can | rent this nightclub for my client's company party?”  
Every event is held somewhere—a specific space and place. Events can be held in  
almost any place imaginable, from purpose-built facilities to unique or off-premise  
sites, even in industrial real estate masquerading as a trendy nightclub. Large public  
events can be held outside in public parks or in the streets, or inside in convention  
facilities, town halls, or shopping malls. Private or corporate events can be held in  
hotel function spaces, stately homes, or out in the middle of a desert. Some events  
such as annual festivals are held in a specific place year after year. Others, such as  
hospitality functions and incentive events, seek new and unusual sites.  
Selecting and developing the event's site encompasses a series of issues, as shown  
in Figure 3.1\. Site selection is both a science and an art—part investigation and part  
intuition. The professional event coordinator will select a site based on the purpose,

role, goals, and objectives of the event, as well as the capabilities, desirability, and safety  
of the venue or location. He or she must blend the needs and wants of the host and  
guests with the realities of availability, capability, affordability, and accessibility. The site  
selected must then be suitably arranged for occupancy ensuring that all the needs iden-  
tified in the event assessment are met, including regulatory and safety requirements.  
Site Specifications and Sourcing  
Site selection is, in essence, a procurement issue. This means that the purchaser  
needs to know what features this “product” should or must have. The professional  
event coordinator should review the nature, scope, complexity, physical, and bud-  
getary requirements of the event project when determining the factors pertinent to  
this purchase decision. These must then be incorporated into an event profile that  
will be used when sourcing and soliciting pricing proposals from potential sites,  
as well as making decisions regarding additional products or services that might be  
required in order to adapt the site selected for the activities to be conducted.  
The event site might be predetermined, or the professional event coordinator  
might be charged with searching out and securing a venue from literally a world  
of possibilities. The site where an event is held can have a significant impact on  
the shape and style of the event, and vice versa, and might or might not require  
additional development to make it ready to welcome the guests. Many profes-  
sional event coordinators prefer to select the site prior to establishing a theme in  
order to capitalize on the intrinsic features of the venue or destination.  
Establish Event Specifications  
The site selection process starts with the needs assessment, which will identify the  
requirements of the event host or client, the needs and desires of the audience or  
attendees, and the specifications associated with the event elements. The results  
of the assessment, which are used to create the event profile or prospectus, include  
the event objectives \(why\), attendee expectations \(who\), event format and scope  
\(what\), geographic and physical requirements \(where\), and dates and schedules  
\(when\). The professional event coordinator often has many different options;  
however, a site evaluation may be conducted, rather than a selection, if only one  
site is possible or preselected. Several factors affect the search for potential sites or  
venues that can accommodate the event profile\:  
\* Availability—date\(s\) and duration, including move-in and move-out  
requirements, and acceptable service levels  
° Location—geographic location \(country/region/locale\), accessibility by air  
and ground transportation, proximity to other attractions, and the sur-  
rounding environment 62  
Developing the Event Site  
Facility type—purpose-specific or purpose-built, indoor/outdoor, housing  
and service capability, unique venue, etc.  
Rates—rental fees, costs for site development, food and beverage prices, and  
surcharges  
Attendance—occupancy capacity, anticipated behaviors, arrival and departure  
modes, housing patterns, and ancillary activities before, during, and after  
the event  
\* Function type—educational, spectator, ceremonial, social, political, ete.  
¢ Event elements—room dimensions, spatial requirements, activities, access  
logistics, storage, and administrative functions  
\* Style or personality—conservative, adventurous, youthful, mature, rustic,  
luxurious, unique, traditional, theme-specific, etc.

Eli Gorin, CMP, ee of Aventura, Florida- fae ee gMeetings, Inc., con-  
tends that one of the most misunderstood and misperceived regions of the  
world when it comes to meetings and events is Latin America, a region he  
has worked extensively in. “Latin America is a region that transcends specific  
borders and is linked greatly by cultural and historical pride, something which  
can be seen in the various countries one can travel to. Whether it is Mexico,  
Colombia, Peru, Argentina, or any country in between, each has its own roots  
and cultural wonders that are evident in daily ways of life. Unlike many other  
modern nations, many of the countries in Latin America were established  
centuries ago, based on their cultural histories.”  
Gorin says that one of the areas where this cultural history is most evi-  
dent is in the service one can experience when working in these coun-  
tries and that Latin Americans are, by nature, very hospitable people. Also,  
because many of the countries in Latin America rely on service sectors to  
be the main source of GDP, human interaction and working one-on-one  
is common, and an inherent level of service is expected. “Taking this into  
consideration along with the opportunity to introduce people to their rich  
cultural history provides visitors the opportunity to come to a new country  
with not just the chance to have a very successful meeting or event, but the  
opportunity to educate attendees on a culture they might not have had a  
chance to experience any other time” Site Specifications and Sourcing  
63  
Develop Selection Criteria  
The site specifications become the basis for the selection criteria, which facilitates  
the ability to evaluate available options and make the best purchase decisions regard-  
ing the suitability of a potential site or venue. Selection criteria include location,  
cost, space, facilities, and personnel. The professional event coordinator works with  
the client or event organization to establish the prioritized criteria for each event.  
Location  
For many association and corporate meetings, the destination or site may be  
affected by internal policies, such as mandated regional rotation of annual meet-  
ings or the requirement that there be a host chapter. Other conference, business,  
or event tourism factors are marketing-driven, such as the attractiveness of and  
attractions available at a destination such as cultural sites, museums, restaurants,  
shopping, recreation, theaters, and festivals or other events. Environmental factors  
include weather, scenic beauty, convenience, economic health, community spirit,  
and the friendliness of the local people.  
In today’s world, a primary criterion in selecting a destination, for both tourism  
and events, is safety. Peter Tarlow \(2002, 210\) notes that “people now use safety and  
security as one of the reasons for choosing a particular site.” Therefore, the area sur-  
rounding an event site should be evaluated based on safety and security conditions  
in addition to its physical appeal. Political unrest, crime-ridden areas, extensive  
roadway construction, or other potentially hazardous conditions must be evaluated  
carefully. These do not necessarily prevent a site from being considered, but additional  
precautions might need to be implemented to make it feasible.  
The proximity and accessibility of the location might be important to the event,  
including such considerations as the distance to the airport, routes and access to  
adjacent parking areas, routes and access to public transportation \(trains, buses,  
subways, etc.\), and even access to the event grounds. When producing an off-  
premise conference event in an air and space museum on a military base, I had to  
provide a complete guest list to the facility 30 days prior to the event in order  
to be issued a security clearance allowing the guests on base.  
Cost  
The cost criteria include not only the rates to rent a facility but also the costs  
of getting and staying there for the attendees. Hotel room rates, travel distance  
and transportation costs, parking fees, and numerous other expenses will affect  
the desirability of an event site or destination. The amount of site development  
or improvement will also nave a budgetary impact. The facility or site might be  
beautiful and capable of accommodating the event’s guests and activities, but  
there might be insufficient parking areas, unsuitable toilet facilities \(in regard  
to quantity, quality, or handicap accessibility\), or inadequate kitchens or food 64 Developing the Event Site  
preparation areas. Such conditions can necessitate securing additional equipment  
and services to bring the site up to your standards.  
When negotiating for space with a hotel, the professional event coordinator  
must understand the revenue models for the facility under consideration.  
Hotels typically make their profit on the sleeping rooms rather than their func-  
tion space. In negotiating for exclusive use of a restaurant, the projected income  
from the event will be weighed against the lost business from regular restau-  
rant patrons. When considering use of a property open to the public, such as a  
museum or historical site, note that the setup time might be restricted to a period  
after the facility closes to the public, and this can entail additional installation  
labor to ensure that the event is ready on time.  
Space  
Depending on the type and scope of the event you are coordinating, you might need  
sleeping rooms, function rooms, administrative space, storage space, exhibit space, hos-  
pitality suites, staff and volunteer lounges, green rooms, dressing rooms, media lounges,  
and numerous other types of space. Spatial considerations also include the dimensional  
requirements for both the people and the equipment necessary to produce the event.  
Empty ballrooms or exhibit halls look huge, especially to clients. However, once you  
factor in all the space-eating activities, the true capacity becomes apparent.  
Sometimes allied groups want or need to convene in tandem with your event,  
such as for leadership meetings prior to an annual conference, hospitality functions  
conducted by sponsors during the event, or leisure or recreational activities after  
the event. Such activities must be considered, either as a mandated inclusion  
in the scope of the overall event or as features that increase the value of the  
event. Some organizations exercise strict control over these ancillary activities;  
for instance, there might be a policy that hospitality suites may be booked only  
with prior approval of the sponsoring organization to control ambush-marketing  
tactics of companies that are not sponsors or exhibitors.  
Facilities  
The features and attributes of an event site include appearance, furnishings, equip-  
ment, and amenities. Every site or venue has particular capabilities and constraints.  
The professional event coordinator should consider the public areas \(including the  
grounds\), the décor, the equipment, services available, cleanliness, maintenance  
and upkeep, and congested areas. Other physical considerations include elevators  
\(particularly freight elevators\), kitchen facilities, public toilet facilities, recreational  
facilities, loading docks and storage facilities, safety and security features, plus electrical  
and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning \(HVAC\) capabilities.  
You might also have to confirm the technological abilities of a venue or site.  
Depending on the event elements, you might need a certain infrastructure and services Site Specifications and Sourcing  
65  
such as fiber-optic cables, analog and digital communications lines, wireless com-  
munications capability, Internet access or intranet capability, closed-circuit television,  
electronic marquee messaging, and closed-circuit digital recording security systems.  
Be sure to check the security cameras at a facility you are considering; they might not  
be functional or monitored by anyone. You might be able to overcome potential prob-  
lems by bringing in equipment and/or outside services that will meet your standards.  
Personnel  
Many professional event coordinators consider the personnel and level of service  
at a facility as important as the physical property itself\: Service personnel in purpose-built  
facilities might include a general manager, convention services manager, account  
representative or event supervisor; chef and banquet staff; banquet setup manager;  
janitorial or housekeeping, security, and engineering staff; and recommended or  
exclusive vendors. Excellent service can overcome many weaknesses of a facility,  
just as poor service can destroy the value of an excellent venue.  
When faced with a list of exclusive, certified, or recommended vendors that  
you must use, understand that these vendors often have extensive experience in  
the particular venue and can disclose hidden limitations and obscure opportunities.  
These vendors must often adhere to a specific set of facility regulations, and  
sometimes they must pay the facility a fee or commission on sales. At some venues,  
you may negotiate the ability to use an outside vendor or provider; however, this  
could incur a commission fee to the exclusive or in-house provider.  
Site Sourcing  
Once the specifications and selection criteria have been developed, the search  
begins. You know, specifically or generally, where in the world your event site  
should be and what type of facility you are looking for. You know what features  
and capabilities you need the event site to have, and you know when and how  
long you will need to occupy the site. Now you must describe all these require-  
ments in a request for proposal \(RFP\) or tender brief that can be distributed to  
potential event venues or properties you identify in your search so that they can  
respond with their ability and offer to accommodate your event.  
Research potential sites by reviewing sites used by similar types and scopes of  
events in the locations in which you wish your event to occur. The typical types  
of venue used for meetings and conventions are convention centers or congress  
halls, conference centers, and hotels or resorts with conference space. The typi-  
cal venues for festivals are purpose-built fair or festival grounds, city squares or  
plazas, along city streets, or in city parks. The typical special or social event occurs  
in hotel ballrooms, banquet halls, or within a tent or marquee installed on private  
property. The typical sports events take place in purpose-built sports facilities such  
as stadiums, arenas, and sport-specific courses or fields. 66  
Developing the Event Site  
Research methods include contacting local convention and visitors bureaus or  
tourism authorities in your destination of choice, talking with your colleagues and  
suppliers in industry organizations, and searching the Internet. If the event has taken  
place in a hotel before and you were pleased with the outcome and level of service,  
you may wish to contact the national or regional sales office of that hotel brand for  
recommendations. If the event has a specific constituency, contacting members or  
officials within its representative organization might be a good starting point.  
Your RFP should give a description of the event and the organization host-  
ing or producing it, an attendee profile \(including special needs\), a history of the  
event, and a detailed list of all the requirements. You should also include instructions  
for responding with a proposal as well as key decision factors and the decision  
timeline \(including deadline for submitting a proposal\). The more venues you  
have under consideration, the more important it will be to standardize your RFP  
so that it will be easier to compare and contrast incoming proposals.  
Unique Venues  
Although most events occur in venues or properties that are typical for their genre,  
Certified Fund Raising Executive James S. Armstrong \(2001, 52\) notes, “Attendance  
may benefit from the magnetic power of a unique and exclusive locale” and recom-  
mends “locations that not just anyone could rent or access.” When looking for a  
unique venue, you must be like a location scout for a film, viewing virtually any  
space or place as a potential event venue. Unusual space within a purpose-built  
facility might be the unique venue you have been looking for, such as an area that  
has not been used for events before, or a traditional space you might develop in a  
new way. Note, too, that a tent or marquee may be set up almost anywhere, either  
as a stand-alone venue or as extra space to increase the capacity of an existing site.  
# ON-SITE  
INSIGHT |  
Ralph Traxler, CSEP, president and senior designer of RTx inc., an event design  
and production firm with offices in Atlanta and the United Kingdom, shared  
this experience using a unique venue for an event. The special event for a cor-  
porate sponsor was planned for a rooftop ballroom of a historic downtown  
theater. No freight elevators were available. The only way to get the equip-  
ment up to the ballroom was to transfer the equipment from a trailer to a van  
and then bring it up to the parking deck adjacent to the ballroom. The theme  
included a jungle and Moroccan desert set for a takeoff of Indiana Jones.  
Trees as tall as 25 feet and two live camels were brought in for décor and  
atmosphere. The camels were walked up four levels of the parking garage. Site Specifications and Sourcing

A unique venue should be carefully examined to determine its capabilities and  
challenges. The facets you should be looking at include\:  
\* Accessibility for the vendors providing the goods and services for the event  
° Accessibility for the guests  
¢ Workable space for preparations and event activities  
¢ Power and parking capabilities  
¢ Safety and sanitation issues  
You must consider the protection of the property and property rights of the venue as  
well as of its neighbors. A historic conference center, now surrounded by a quiet rural  
neighborhood, was prohibited from hosting any social functions whatsoever because  
neighbors had had too many incidents of drunken guests wandering onto their proper-  
ties and befouling the bushes. Do not let the potential logistical challenges posed by  
a unique venue deter you from considering creative alternatives such as those listed in  
Figure 3.2 as a site for your event. Depending on the type and scope of the event, the  
unusual can be the difference between a rewarding or routine event experience.

When approaching a new venue to schedule an event, particularly if events  
have not been held at that location before, the professional event coordinator  
should explain the project—describing the purpose of the event, the program  
and activities, and the type of guests attending. He or she must always respect the  
venues concerns regarding damage, security, structural or environmental impact,  
and the loss of privacy, and do whatever it takes to address and alleviate these  
concerns. This may require special insurance, moving furnishings into a storage  
facility, protecting or replacing vegetation, providing security personnel, blocking  
off streets or changing traffic routes \(which must be coordinated with the local  
transportation authority\).  
Web-Based Event Sites  
There are times and situations that require an alternative to on-site or in-person  
attendance at an event. This may include providing an ancillary component for  
those unable to attend the on-site event, extending the event after the event, and  
holding the entire event as a “virtual” experience. Restrictions on time, travel,  
and/or budget may dictate that a meeting or educational program be held as a  
videoconference or call-in Webinar \(a seminar conducted through an Internet  
service\). Conventions may expand their reach or better serve their constituency  
by video streaming certain keynote or “town hall” presentations. Certain speak-  
ers or special guest appearances may be facilitated through use of holographic  
telepresence technology. Digital video of any event or event component could be  
uploaded onto an Internet site \(the event organization’s Web site or Youlube\) so  
that attendees and those unable to attend can view it after the event.  
Webinars, using such services as Webex \(www.webex.com\), GotoMeeting \(www  
.gotomeeting.com\), and other Web conferencing services, can be live and interactive  
using chat rooms, Q & A functions, audience polling and collaboration features,  
and can also be recorded for future on-demand use. 3D platforms from such pro-  
viders as Gconnex \(www.6connex.com\), iCongo Live \(www.icongolive.com\), and  
others combine Web-based conferencing, streaming media, content download sys-  
tems, and social media in a visually three-dimensional environment. Multiuser vir-  
tual environments \(MUVEs\) such as Second Life \(http\://secondlife.com\), Kaneva  
\(www.kaneva.com\), ActiveWorlds \(www.activeworlds.com\), and other virtual  
worlds are currently being used by large corporations as an alternate meeting site  
depending on the nature of the meeting's objectives and attendance requirements.  
The 3D environment and avatar-based interaction features of these are very familiar  
to younger generations who have far greater experience in the gaming environment,  
which suggests that they will embrace this technology more readily and its use for a 70 Developing the Event Site  
variety of meetings and events will increase over time \(Hogg 2010\). Sandy Biback,  
CMP, CMM, of Toronto-based Imagination+ Meeting Planners Inc., notes that  
virtual events are “a tool for the tool box; a good planner will know when it is best  
to do this type of event and how to get it done.”

ON-SITE | The meetings industry has continued to grow, change, and evolve in order  
to meet the continuing demands of our attendees, corporate and association  
INSIGHT i users, and our global clients. All of these entities—business, corporate, social,  
' and affinity groups—have made dramatic demands on the planning industry  
| to provide new solutions to meet the reducing budgetary restrictions.  
In addition, our real world environment has imposed higher levels of  
security and travel challenges that demand today’s planners expand their  
knowledge and expertise to fully understand, sell concepts, and produce  
meeting environments that utilize these newer tools, stepping into the  
| world of virtual technology in order to simply retain clients and or attract  
new opportunities.  
In order to address these challenges, Dan Parks, president and creative  
director of Dana Point, California-based Corporate Planners Unlimited,  
Inc., created the Virtualis Convention and Learning Center in 2008. Parks  
said, “Virtual environments refer to a gathering of people who meet in  
an online environment at a set time to acquire info, share, network, and  
engage. Virtualis provides a forum of perfectly planned meeting space,  
with exterior and interior spatial design we all would like to have in the  
real world.” \(www.virtualiscenter.com\)  
He also points out, “It's human nature to want to explore and interact in  
new technology, especially when the operating interactions are simple and  
easily learned. And giving virtual attendees control of their interactions with  
each other, the media, and the content enhances learning,” citing a study \(U.S.  
Department of Education 2009\) showing that adults in online learning con-  
ditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. Parks  
spells out the results for one of his clients, Trend Micro, a technology-based  
company\: “They have been able to reduce costs by approximately 90 percent,  
eliminate all travel and time-out-of-office manpower, and provide globally  
encompassing program content to its sales management teams, with each  
subsequent year resulting in higher levels of success and retention of content  
for the attendees.”

Site Inspection and Selection  
Once a list of possible event sites has been compiled, a decision must be made  
about which site should be used. This decision may be made by the professional  
event coordinator and/or someone else depending on the structure of authority  
for the event project. Site selection authority must be specified, including con-  
sultation or approval requirements, which may include board members, clients,  
committees, executive directors, managers, procurement departments or other  
decision makers or influencers. The site selection decision should be based on  
the prioritized selection criteria that have been developed, therefore the profes-  
sional event coordinator should conduct site inspections to investigate, evalu-  
ate, and/or verify viability of facilities and services under consideration. Once  
the best option has been selected and confirmed as available and affordable,  
contracts that accurately specify all agreed upon arrangements should be negotiated  
and executed.  
Site Inspection Strategies  
Site inspections are conducted to confirm the best fit. Unless it is completely impos-  
sible, the professional event coordinator should personally examine a site prior to  
signing a contract. Glossy brochures, Web sites, and other marketing materials are 72 Developing the Event Site  
designed to show a property in its best light. In addition, capacities and dimensions  
listed in a brochure may be misleading. The capacities will be based on the maxi-  
mum occupancy allowed by local code, -but if all those space eaters such as a  
dance floor, stage, or rear screen projection are added in, the maximum number  
quickly shrinks. And although the dimensions might be accurate, there might be  
obstructions that could encumber your design possibilities. The ceiling height  
in one brochure referred to the uppermost point in a ballroom for which I was  
designing a screen surround; however, the tracks for the air wall were 12 inches  
lower. This had a significant effect on the size of the prop that would be custom-made  
for this event.  
You should come prepared to view every part of the venue that might have  
an impact on the ability to produce your event, using a site inspection checklist  
designed to allow you to rate and evaluate the selection criteria and specifications  
important to the event \(see Appendix 3\). There is no one perfect site inspection  
checklist appropriate for all events; you must customize a list for each event, based  
on the requirements of that event.  
Many event professionals suggest that site inspection visits should be con-  
ducted at approximately the same time of year that the event is to take place so  
as to get an accurate judgment of the conditions for the actual event. Others sug-  
gest “secret shopping”—arriving at the property unannounced and as a regular  
guest. This allows you to view the property as your guests or attendees would and  
experience the actual services provided by the property. You should also search  
for hidden issues, zoning restrictions or union requirements for example, which  
could affect your ability to produce the event as designed or increase the costs  
for doing so.  
Site Procurement  
Once one or more sites have been identified as a good option for the event,  
the professional event coordinator will begin negotiations that should lead to  
a written contract confirming the final selection and agreement to the terms  
associated with use of that site \(see Figure 3.3\). Negotiations will define what  
each party to the contract requires and will provide, and often includes conces-  
sions on both sides in order to reach an agreement that provides an equitable  
and mutually beneficial relationship. Many purpose-build facilities have stan-  
dard contracts as well as operational rules and regulations; these should be  
reviewed early in the selection’ and negotiation process if possible so that the  
critical needs of the event and event organization may be effectively addressed  
during the negotiations regarding the scope of the agreement and compromises  
by both parties. Site Planning and Layout

grounds and remedies for such things as cancellation, termination,  
nonperformance, attrition, force majeure, negligence, changes in  
ownership or condition of facility, changes in scope of goods or  
services, and other items that would or could result in the inability  
to fulfill the terms of the agreement.  
Acceptance Signatures of authorized representatives of all parties to the contract,  
including names of the parent organization and signatory’s title and  
the date signed. The purchaser should sign the contract first so that any  
changes may be negotiated prior to final execution of the contract.

Site Planning and Layout  
Once a site has been selected and contracted for, you must determine how best  
to allocate the space. An event site is an environment that includes physical sur-  
roundings, atmosphere, facilities, activities, and the people in attendance. The  
manner in which the space is used can help to control movement, direct attention,  
enhance interactions, and facilitate the smooth progress of individuals within and  
through it, as well as the progression through the event experience.  
The site begins either as a blank canvas on which you can “paint” the event  
elements, or a puzzle requiring you to fit the pieces together. You must consider  
placement, proximity, and accessibility, and position the activities, equipment,  
and service areas according to the needs of the event and the constraints of the  
space, including the logistics of setting up, servicing, and clearing the event site.  
You must also confirm that the site layout is safe, legible, and accommodates  
individuals with disabilities.

Facets of a Typical Site  
Contract 74  
Developing the Event Site  
Identify Spatial Requirements  
The professional event coordinator must incorporate into the site plan the spa-  
tial requirements of all the equipment and elements needed, including both the  
“footprint” \(the actual space on the floor or ground\) and the area required around  
a particular piece of equipment or event activity. For example, if a double-sided  
buffet station is 8 feet long by 30 inches wide, the space required around it might  
indicate blocking out a space 14 feet by 10 feet to allow for guests and service  
personnel. When the buffet station equipment is shown on a floor plan diagram it  
may appear that there is still a lot of floor space still available, which is why people  
are often tempted to squeeze more items into the plan.  
Virtually any element of an event will require space, from arrival to departure of  
the attendees and guests, participants and performers, and the vendors and volunteers.  
You must consider each of these individuals and their needs and expectations when  
designing the site plan. Review the items in Figure 3.4 to create a checklist of what  
should be included when developing the site or floor plan for your particular event.

\(Continued\)  
Proximity Issues  
Certain elements must be next to certain other elements, and some elements should  
not be next to other particular elements. Safety and sanitation issues must be carefully  
considered\: the juxtaposition of food service areas and toilet facilities; slip and trip haz-  
ards posed by cords, cables, wires, hoses, lines, and connections associated with power  
or water; and ventilation or container security requirements for petrol, propane, natu-  
ral or other gases used for cooking, heating, filling balloons, or portable generators.  
All the logistical requirements of the production and servicing of the event  
must be scrutinized from the perspective of proximities as well. Catering tents or  
kitchens might have to be a specific distance from the function space, or holding  
and preparation areas provided adjacent to the room. Exhibitor parking for an  
outdoor craft fair might have to be contiguous with the exhibit stalls, or you  
might find craftspeople parking their vehicles on the grass next to their stalls so  
they can quickly replenish stock. Storage areas and facilities must be identified  
and positioned to ensure a clean, sanitary, and attractive event space. There will  
be numerous spaces within a floor plan that are usable for storage because they are  
behind, below, or beside an event element, but they must be accessible as required  
and protected from unauthorized access.  
Structural and Environmental Impact  
The professional event coordinator must carefully consider the potential struc-  
tural or environmental impact of the event elements on the event site. If a new  
automobile or piece of heavy farm equipment is to be showcased, the floor load  
limit will have to be verified with the venue management or engineer. If the sur-  
face of the floor is tile, it could be damaged by heavy equipment rolling over it.  
There might be a need for rigging points in a ceiling for installing décor or light-  
ing, and these rigging points have specific weight tolerances.  
Many, if not most, facilities will restrict attaching or taping anything to the  
walls in order to reduce maintenance costs. Even a quickly drawn meeting sign  
taped to a door might damage the paint or wood when pulled off. One décor  
company was presented with a hefty bill for replacing the carpet of an entire 76 Developing the Event Site  
meeting space when a careless employee did some quick touch-up on the props  
with a can of spray paint. Another company.had to foot the bill for having a hand-  
painted floor redone because the carpet tape used to install a red-carpet entry  
lifted chunks of paint when removed.  
Outdoor sites should be considered in terms of the impact on the surrounding  
grounds, vegetation, and ecosystem. Environmental impacts include light and sound  
pollution, equipment access and installation \(damaging vegetation, disturbing fauna\),  
and the effect of hundreds, even thousands of people trampling on the grass or ground.  
You may need to plan for turf replacement, tree trimming, or surface grading.  
Traffic Flow  
Designing a site plan also involves the direction and control of human and vehicular  
traffic flow—the movement to, through, around, within, and away from the event site.  
There must be sufficient space allotted to allow access, egress, and easy passage within  
the event. Traffic flow considerations include safety and security, crowd control, arrival  
and departure modes, queuing patterns, deliveries, and loading/unloading needs.  
Human traffic ow might be managed through the use of barricades, fencing,  
or rope and stanchions to help direct and control the flow entering or depart-  
ing the event or at activities within the event. Positioning of activities or event  
elements can help reduce congestion in certain areas and build traffic in others,  
such as positioning concessions or demonstrations in the least accessible areas of a  
trade show to increase traffic to those exhibitors. The position of an event element  
or activity might affect the profit potential for the organizer; trade show space is  
often priced based on proximity to the entrance or whether it is end-of-aisle space,  
center island space, or other desirable space.  
The professional event coordinator must also anticipate potential areas of  
congestion. Retail anthropologists have found that as people enter a shopping  
mall or retail establishment, they slow down to get a navigational scan and ori-  
ent themselves to the new environment \(Underhill 2000\). This movement pat-  
tern indicates that the entrance to an event or event site should be spacious and  
uncluttered. Food stations and bars should be readily visible, but never posi-  
tioned directly adjacent to the entrance. However, information stands or con-  
cierge tables should be near an entrance.  
The layout can also affect service flow. The tables at a large banquet function  
should be set in quadrants, with wider aisles between the quadrants to facilitate effi-  
cient serving and clearing. Popular activities or entertainment should be allocated  
additional space for queues, and to prevent them from obstructing access to service  
areas. Special routes should be established for deliveries and maintenance activities.  
The professional event coordinator should become familiar with queue man-  
agement in order to manage the use of space appropriately. Long registration and Site Planning and Layout  
77  
buffet lines are often the most frustrating to the event attendee. A snaking line,  
established with a rope and stanchions, might be used, or the number of portals or  
buffets might be increased. The cultural implications should also be considered—  
some societies naturally form queues, whereas others do not. The start of a queue  
should be obvious and should not obstruct other event activities.  
Vehicular traffic considerations include zones for passenger drop-off and pickup,  
taxis or motor coaches, loading and unloading materials, service vehicles used  
to replenish supplies, and the vehicular traffic that normally surrounds an event  
site. You must exercise great care whenever pedestrians and vehicles are likely to  
occupy the same space, particularly in urban settings. Even crossing the street  
should be a factor in your site plan.  
You might need to establish staging or marshaling areas where people and/or  
equipment might gather or line up prior to the start of the event. For a parade,  
there might be hundreds of people in marching bands, elaborate floats, equestrian  
groups, motorcycle clubs, and dignitaries in all sorts of vehicles, which must all be  
assembled and sent off in order. For sports events, there might be opening  
and closing ceremonies, including a parade of athletes and numerous entertainers  
or entertainment features. For large exhibitions, there might be a fleet of large  
trucks, with their drivers checking in and waiting for further instructions before  
delivering freight to an exhibit hall.  
Creatively Using Space  
When designing the layout of the event, the professional event coordinator should  
endeavor to merge the spatial needs and traffic flow with a creative approach to  
the use of the space. Particularly in unique or unusual spaces, you might need  
to devise unconventional configurations and space usage. Unique dining table  
shapes may be created using serpentine or half-moon tables. Video screens may  
be used to broadcast the entertainment into various rooms or to various floors.  
Nooks and crannies may be draped to block off busing or prep areas for the  
caterer. The main stage may be hidden by a balloon wall that will explode when  
the speeches are over and the dancing is to begin.  
Constantly exercise your creativity by viewing a space with a fresh perspective,  
even a space that has “always been set this way.” Unless you are in a facility with  
fixed seating, there are dozens of ways you can configure the chairs and tables  
to create an out-of-the-ordinary meeting environment, dining environment, or  
entertainment environment. Risers may be used to provide different levels for  
tables. Décor and draping may be used to reshape a room. Tents may be used  
to extend the indoors outdoors. Hallways can become entertainment areas, and  
driveways can become dining areas. It is all up to you and your ability to see  
things in a fresh and creative manner. 78 Developing the Event Site  
Site and Floor Plans  
An accurate diagram of the event space is cfucial to the planning and production  
of the event, as well as for securing approvals and permits from a fire marshal or  
municipal authorities. The site or floor plan diagram should include all the  
features and constraints of the site, such as doors, windows, electrical outlets, and  
posts or pillars within a function room, or the buildings, roads, and vegeta-  
tion at an outdoor site. A site or floor plan is a map of where everything included  
in the event will be placed, and as a map, it should always indicate the scale and  
the universal reference direction, north.  
This diagram may be created by computer, using simple graphics software or  
sophisticated computer-aided design \(CAD\) programs, hand-drawn on graph  
paper, or created by a graphic designer. Hogg \(2010\) notes that floor plan  
software programs such as MeetingMatrix \(www.meetingmatrix.com\), Frog Ware  
\(www.frogware.com\), SmartDraw \(www.smartdraw.com\), Viviene \(www.cast-soft  
.com\) and others are available, but should be carefully considered from an invest-  
ment perspective \(financial and training-time\). Many décor companies have mea-  
sured and drafted accurate site plans for the venues in which they work, and you  
might wish to work with them to create a floor plan diagram for your event.  
Hotels and convention centers sometimes have this CAD capability as well, but  
many rely on their vendors, either decorators or in-house audiovisual providers,  
to provide floor plans for an event.  
Granted, there are plenty of planners and venue personnel who work from a  
sketch on a notepad or paper napkin, but the professional event coordinator uses  
an accurate, to-scale diagram not only to plan and control efficient operations,  
but also to communicate his or her abilities and professionalism to the client,  
venue management, and regulatory officials \(see Figures 3.5 and 3.6\). Accurate  
and detailed site and floor plans become exponentially critical as the size and  
scope of an event increase.  
The site plan or floor plan illustrates the use of the space to clients, vendors,  
staff, participants, and authorities. It is a valuable planning tool in determining  
the usage of the site and verifying the viability of the logistics. Therefore, a draft  
of the diagram should be circulated to key stakeholders for their review and rec-  
ommendations. Once any necessary revisions haye been made, the final draft should  
be distributed to all those who will use it to create, fabricate, assemble, deliver,  
install, operate, replenish, and remove the goods and services associated with the  
event production. You must still be prepared, however, for last-minute changes on-  
site at the time of the event.  
It might be appropriate to create several versions of the diagram. Not everyone  
needs to know where absolutely everything will be on-site. For example, the  
storage area for expensive equipment or materials should not be identified to  
anyone except those requiring access. William O'Toole \(2002\) suggests having a Site Planning and Layout 79

81  
Site Occupancy Issues  
Now that the site has been selected and the plans for its layout have been  
developed, it is important to consider the issues surrounding the actual occu-  
pancy of the site. The professional event coordinator will need to supervise  
the logistics of the move-in, set-up, maintenance, take-down, and move-out  
at the event site; liaise with facility management and site-specific personnel;  
and monitor and control housing and facility usage. This is the on-site imple-  
mentation of the project plan discussed in Chapter 2. The professional event  
coordinator must also ensure compliance with all applicable statutes, codes,  
and regulations regarding site layout and usage, including accessibility for  
individuals with physical disabilities.  
Action Plan Logistics  
The execution of this on-site action plan encompasses all inbound, outbound,  
and intra-event movement and tasks throughout the duration of the site occu-  
pancy, and is reliant upon the successful application of logistics. Logistics is the  
system of applying the principles of logic and reasoning. In its original milieu,  
logistics was the military science of procurement, distribution, and transporta-  
tion of troops and matériel. The professional event coordinator must scan the  
event site and its environment to ensure that goods and services can be trans-  
ported and delivered efficiently and effectively.  
Food service logistics, from replenishing buffet stations to waste disposal, must  
be anticipated and mapped into the site layout. Décor and equipment might require  
maintenance during the event. Entertainment and entertainers have numerous  
vehicles and huge crews that must move through the event site. Speakers or athletes  
often require special access, special areas, or special equipment delivered.  
Load-in, load-out, loading docks, and loading zones must be plotted and often  
planned meticulously. Load-in is usually arranged with the largest items going in  
first, followed by the smaller ones, and load-out is usually in reverse \(first in, last  
out\). However, depending on the type of event, the products or vendors, and the  
venue, this may or may not be the case.  
Sufficient lighting and other essential utilities must be available and function-  
ing during the delivery, installation, operation, dismantling, and removal phases  
as appropriate. Adequate and properly trained personnel must be provided. Plans  
might need to be adapted to changing circumstances and communicated to facil-  
ity and service personnel involved and affected. Inspections may need to be made  
before, during, and after the event. Finally, all equipment, temporary structures,  
waste, and other materials must be removed at the close of the event, and the site  
must be returned to the condition specified in all contractual agreements. 82 Developing the Event Site  
Permits and Permissions  
The site plan or floor plan and the event itself must comply with all applicable  
legislation, ordinances, and other jurisdictional regulations. Not only is securing  
the appropriate permits and permissions a legal requirement, it is also a sound  
risk management practice in ensuring a successful and sustainable event and event  
organization. Most, if not all, of these regulations have been instituted to ensure a  
safe environment for and reputable services provided to attendees and personnel  
working at a venue or site.  
It is the responsibility of the professional event coordinator to identify and  
secure all the necessary permits, approvals, licenses, waivers, certificates, and other  
compliance instruments in accordance with the type and scope of the event being  
produced. This might include securing certificates of insurance and copies of  
licenses from the vendors supplying goods and services to the event, certificates  
of inspection \(for elevators or alarm systems\) from the venue, or visas and tem-  
porary work permits if the event is being held in another country. Working in a  
foreign country might also involve securing agricultural permits for bringing in  
floral supplies, customs clearance for importing décor and supplies, and sales tax  
recovery \(e.g., value-added tax, VAT\). The event coordinator should check with  
local authorities, the venue management, the vendors and suppliers, and legal and  
financial advisors to determine the standard and customary permits and permis-  
sions required for the operations of the event.  
Depending on the size and scope of the event and where it is to take place, the  
professional event coordinator may need to secure permits or licenses for alco-  
hol service, entertainment \(in regard to noise levels\), fireworks, food handling,  
gaming \(bingo, lottery, or contests\), music use, ocean or lake use, parades or  
marches, parking, public assembly, signs or banners, street closures, venue or site  
occupancy, waste management, and numerous other event elements and opera-  
tions. The event organization might require a business license and tax identifica-  
tion number \(national or federal and/or state or provincial\).  
Many cities have planning guides on their Web sites that describe all the  
types of permits one would need for various special events and festivals \(e.g.,  
Toronto\). Some municipalities allow you to secure all necessary permits from  
one special events office \(e.g., Chicago and San Diego\), whereas others may  
have numerous departments and agencies that must be contacted and worked  
with independently. Some permissions require forms be filled out, some require  
copies of site plans and other documentation, and others may require your  
appearance before a commission, board, or committee to verbally and visually  
present your event plan. The time required to secure these permissions, often  
related to the specific bureaucracy of the granting authority, can range from  
the time it takes to fill out a form and pay a fee to days or weeks to seek out  
and meet with the proper officials. You must factor this into your timeline. Site Occupancy Issues  
83  
Fire Safety Issues  
Of particular importance to events are the occupancy regulations regarding fire  
safety, usually governed by the fire marshal or the local fire brigade/authority.  
In the United States and elsewhere around the world, fire regulations are typi-  
cally based on the Life Safety Code \(NFPA 101\) established by the National  
Fire Protection Association \(www.nfpa.org\). The purpose of the Life Safety  
Code is to establish minimum requirements that will provide a reasonable  
degree of safety from fire in buildings and structures. These regulations cover  
such areas as the number, visibility, and functionality of fire exits, the flam-  
mability of décor and exhibit materials, the storage and use of flammable or  
combustible liquids and gases, sprinkler systems and extinguisher placement,  
and the use of open flames or cooking devices.  
Although fire prevention is paramount, the fire marshal’s specific site concerns  
are that, should a fire occur, those inside or on-site are able to evacuate the area  
quickly and safely and fire-fighting equipment can access the fire. Understand  
that a fire in an enclosed space can become lethal in less than two minutes,  
primarily because of the fumes, and can spread very quickly on the ground in  
an open space.  
The fire marshal might require a copy of the floor or site plan for review prior  
to the event, but might not issue the final approval until he or she conducts an on-  
site inspection. Fire inspections might also be conducted during the course of the  
event. The fire marshal might perform freld flame tests on the décor and acousti-  
cal materials used at the event. You might be asked to install fire extinguishers or  
“Fire Exit” signs at certain points around the site or venue. You might be asked  
to move certain equipment or materials to another location. If you have a roof  
on an exhibit booth, it might require a sprinkler system, and if you are using a  
simple canopy tent to cover your sound and light control board at an outside  
venue, you might need a fire extinguisher within the tented area. You might  
even be asked to install smoke detectors under a stage.  
Other occupancy issues could include the construction of bleachers or grand-  
stands to withstand the loads imposed, floor load limits, designated smoking areas,  
safety of tenting materials and their installation, and, of course, evacuation routes  
and procedures. These are discussed further in Chapter 12, but the acquisition of  
the proper permits will affect and be affected by the design and layout of the site.  
Safety and Sanitation Codes  
Safety and sanitation codes are established to protect the public from harm.  
Occupational safety codes apply to the workplace, which includes an event site  
as well. In the United States, these workplace regulations are established and  
governed by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration \(OSHA\) \(www.osha.goy\). In addition, there are often municipal 84  
Developing the Event Site  
safety and sanitation regulations. These may govern such things as temporary  
food service, noise levels, waste disposal, and numerous other aspects of an event.  
The professional event coordinator must analyze the elements to be included  
in the event, discuss the implications with the providers, and determine the  
specific licenses and permits that are applicable. For example, special effects  
such as pyrotechnics require specific minimum distances between fireworks  
and spectators, and getting fireworks to an event site may be regulated by the  
Department of Transportation, which controls the transport of all hazardous  
materials, including fireworks.  
Documentation Strategies  
Keep copies of everything! This includes the various drafts of your site or floor  
plan, the original diagrams provided by the venue \(its brochure or a printed

ON-SITE. INSIGHT |  
Robert Sivek, CSEP, CERP, chief operating officer of The Meetinghouse Compa-  
nies, Inc., based in Elmhurst, Illinois, and former president of the International  
Special Events Society, maintains that working with public safety officials is a  
relationship-building process. The professional event coordinator must work with  
the inspectors or fire marshals, listen to what they say \(because there is always a  
reason for their concern or stance\), and dialogue to a solution. For example, dur-  
ing the on-site inspection for a street festival, the fire marshal had two specific  
concerns that could have prevented the festival from opening to the public.  
First, there was a line of cold-air inflated balloons providing the primary décor  
that the fire marshal wanted to eliminate because they blocked the only viable  
fire lane into the event site. It was agreed that the fire department had permis-  
sion to “run over the balloons’ if it needed to use the fire lane. Second, the fire  
marshal wanted the largest stage moved a couple of feet farther away from a  
fire hydrant. Because the stage was already installed \(and next to impossible to  
break down, move, and reassemble in time for the event to start\), it was agreed  
that several signs would be installed to highlight exactly where the hydrant was.  
When dealing with fire marshals, inspectors, and union officials, Sivek  
notes that you must become a team member with them and approach the  
task in a positive and proactive manner. “They are trying to protect the public  
or their members. You will create a self-fulfilling prophecy if you go into this  
expecting problems.” Site Occupancy Issues

copy from its Web site\), the spatial dimensions and requirements provided by  
your vendors, the verifications and approvals from your vendors and authori-  
ties, compliance communications regarding accessibility for people with dis-  
abilities, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, certificates of insurance, and any  
other documentation that illustrates the decisions you made and why you made  
them. Some of these documents might have to be displayed on-site at the event,  
particularly permits or licenses. Some will need to be accessible on-site and will  
be included in your production book. Some should be copied, and the originals  
stored securely in your office.  
Compliance with Accessibility Legislation  
Many countries have some form of legislation that prohibits discrimination based  
on disabilities, such as the Disability Discrimination Acts in the United Kingdom  
and Australia and the Persons with Disabilities Acts in Canada and India. In  
the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) guarantees equal  
opportunity for individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, employment,  
transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications. The  
law applies to persons who have impairments that substantially limit major life  
activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual  
tasks, learning, caring for oneself, and working.  
Compliance with the accessibility legislation can affect the professional event  
coordinator in a number of ways, primarily in site selection and development  
and the provision of auxiliary aids. Accessibility legislation typically covers public  
accommodations \(i.e., private entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places  
of public accommodation\), commercial facilities, and private entities that offer  
certain examinations and courses related to educational and occupational certifi-  
cation. This means that both the facility and the entity sponsoring an event at the  
facility are responsible for compliance. The event coordinator should ensure that  
the site selected is architecturally compliant and that the program is communica-  
tions compliant.  
Auxiliary aids to ensure effective communication with individuals with  
hearing, vision, or speech impairments may include such services or devices  
as qualified interpreters, assistive listening headsets, television captioning  
and decoders, telecommunications devices for deaf persons \(TDD\), video-  
text displays, readers, taped texts, brailled materials, and large-print materials.  
Barrier-free building and site elements may include parking, loading zones,  
accessible routes, ramps, stairs, elevators, doors, thresholds, drinking foun-  
tains, bathrooms, controls and operating mechanisms, storage areas, seating  
and tables, and assembly areas. Visual alarms, visual notification devices, sign-  
ages DD and volume-control telephones, and assisted evacuation areas may  
also be required. Whether required by law or not, failure to consider and make 86 Developing the Event Site  
arrangements for those with ambulatory, auditory, mental, literacy, visual, or  
other special needs is discrimination by neglect.  
The event and its site must be accessible fo all those invited to attend \(guests, del-  
egates, attendees, and/or audience\), those required to attend \(staff and suppliers\), and  
those expected to attend \(participants, performers, and volunteers\). It must accom-  
modate people with special needs, sometimes by providing special services, often by  
ensuring that all obstructions or barriers are minimized or eliminated. Consideration  
must be given to disabilities such as mobility or dexterity limitations, hearing or sight  
impairments, and language or literacy limitations \(in regard to those who speak a  
different language or cannot read\), as well as to the accommodations each disabled  
person requires to fully function within the event or environment, \(e.g., wheelchairs  
or mechanical devices, service animals, and assistants or companions\). The profes-  
sional event coordinator must ensure that the event and the site are user-friendly.  
The event and the event site must have sufficient and appropriate ingress,  
egress, and access, not only for the audience but also for the production person-  
nel and equipment. Celebrity guests or dignitaries often require special entrances  
and exits. Media personnel might or might not be provided with access to guests,  
celebrities, VIPs, or participants \(but if the event is news, you can be assured  
the media will be there and angling for access\). Preferential entrances and seating  
might be required for physically challenged individuals, participants, or patrons.  
Exclusive access to specific areas might be required for vendors or volunteers, and  
special training might be required for staff or service personnel.  
Accommodating special needs requires common sense and general sensitivity to  
the issues surrounding a special need. The best person to help you determine what  
form an accommodation should take is the person with the special need. Understand  
that special needs are not exclusively disability-related. You could receive special  
requests from the very short, the very tall, or the very large. You should ask for spe-  
cial needs requests and accommodate them in a nondiscriminatory manner.  
When planning to accommodate the special needs identified by individuals, make  
certain that such needs are integrated throughout the event plan, such as by letting  
speakers or exhibitors know that special handouts will be required, or letting the  
audiovisual team know that a sign language interpreter will be onstage so they can  
make certain the interpreter is well lit and visible even if the lights are lowered for the  
program. You might have to make certain that snow has been removed from acces-  
sible parking stalls, curb cuts, building entrances, and ramps just before the start of the  
event. You might need to scan the environment to make certain that the path of travel  
from the entrance to the function room is free from obstructions \(busy hotel lobbies  
can quickly fill with mountains of luggage at a premium check-in or checkout time\).  
Your staff and the venue's staff should have had some sensitivity training regard-  
ing interactions with and attitudes about individuals with special needs. You should  
speak directly to the individual, rather than to his or her sign language interpreter Wrap Up  
87  
or oral translator. Your tone of voice should be the same as it would be for any other  
individual—persons who are hard of hearing or visually impaired should not be  
shouted at or talked to as if they were children. You might be asked to speak more  
slowly to allow lip reading or a translation to be adapted. A person in a wheelchair  
should not be pushed unless that person so requests. The staff should never be found  
making jokes or disparaging remarks about a disability or deformity.  
Understand, too, that you are not required to provide anything at any time.  
An accommodation requested might be a financial burden or simply not avail-  
able. However, you must make a good faith effort to comply with accessibility  
legislation requirements, as well as other special needs. Such compliance starts by  
adding a line item to the budget for accessibility, followed by familiarizing your-  
self with the options available. It is advisable to include a deadline for requesting  
auxiliary service aids in your marketing materials, giving you sufficient time to  
arrange for the service requested. The more you know about your attendees, the  
better you will be able to serve all their needs.  
Wrap Up  
The professional event coordinator must identify potential event sites by estab-  
lishing selection criteria and quantifying spatial requirements. Event sites include  
purpose-built facilities, unique venues, or urban, rural, or remote open spaces.  
The professional event coordinator evaluates the site’s capabilities and suitability  
to select the best fit for the event.  
The professional event coordinator develops site plans that utilize the space  
appropriately to achieve the goals and objectives of the event and meet the needs  
of the participants and providers. This includes creating accurate diagrams for use  
in the planning, production, and promotion of the event.  
The professional event coordinator determines the requirements and implements  
strategies to ensure full accessibility of the event and event site in compliance  
with the handicap accessibility legislation and other special needs, including  
operational and logistical requirements. He or she also makes sure that the use  
of the event site is in compliance with all federal, state or provincial, and local  
legislation, health and safety ordinances, and other jurisdictional regulations, and  
obtains all necessary permits, licenses, and insurance coverage.

91 he event coordinator was giving a newspaper reporter a tour of the festival  
site prior to opening, showing him all the entertainment stages, food concessions,  
hospitality tents, and activity areas. The reporter asked to see the behind-the-scenes  
operations, so the event coordinator supplied a golf cart and they toured the parking  
areas, the temporary buildings housing the administrative offices and volunteer head-  
quarters, the portable toilet facilities, the storage areas, and utility hookups to genera-  
tors and water tanks. The reporter was astounded at the scope of the operations that  
the festival visitor would take for granted, saying, “You have an entire, fully functioning  
city here!”  
oe 2k OH Be 8 a we ROR OS BOR See ee Yok Ss eS eS HS  
Many an event could qualify as a city unto itself because it must function as  
a self-contained ecosystem, including a complete infrastructure to support the  
temporary virtual metropolis created by the event production. Just as a viable infra-  
structure is vital to the maintenance of a real city, it is critical to an event site as well.  
Kotler, Bowen, and Makens \(1999, 656-658\) define infrastructure as hotels, roads,  
airports, water systems, utility systems, and public services—specifically, public  
safety, traffic and crowd control, emergency health, sanitation, and street cleaning.  
Donald Getz \(1997, 89\) delineates infrastructure in the event context even further\:  
\* Power needs \(generators and dedicated lines, amperage for special equipment,  
protection from weather, outlets, heat and air-conditioning, lighting and  
sound systems, backup and contingency plans\); consultations with suppliers;  
need for electricians or permits; covers to protect people and lines  
¢ Water\: for drinking, food and beverage preparation, washrooms, and par-  
ticipants, legislation and backup supply to be checked  
° Sewerage\: existing lines and capacity; toilet requirements  
° Gas availability  
The event site might be its own virtual metropolis situated on a barren plot  
of land or inside a full-service purpose-built facility, yet it will still require this  
internal infrastructure as well as the external infrastructure of the surrounding  
community or destination. Catherwood and Van Kirk \(1992, 6-7\) note that Transportation

infrastructure, as it relates to special event production, not only includes the physical  
attributes, services, and venues; it also includes community support and coop-  
eration, especially for successfully attracting a world-class event. Just as the proper  
functioning of your municipality of residence provides your quality of life, your  
temporary event metropolis must have sufficient services and systems capacity to  
provide the event’s quality of life for the participants and visitors \(see Figure 4.1\).  
# Transportation  
Transportation requirements for an event will depend on the type and size of a  
particular event, the scope of the professional event coordinator’s responsibili-  
ties, and the impact the event will have on the surrounding community. You  
might be charged with providing travel arrangements for an incentive group,  
street closures for a parade, a convoy of motor coaches to move a group from a  
hotel to an off-premise event, or a fleet of limousines for a motorcade. Getting  
to an event can be an arduous adventure or an effortless exercise; usually, how-  
ever, it is something in between. There are many transportation options for  
getting to the event destination and the options for getting around the desti-  
nation or event site that can streamline and simplify the journey, whether across  
town or around the world \(see Figure 4.2\).

Transportation Needs Assessment  
The professional event coordinator must assess the travel and transportation  
requirements by identifying the likely needs of the general population of attend-  
ees, as well as the special transportation needs of VIPs, performers, providers, and  
sponsors. You might be selecting a site based on adequate “lift” \(the number of  
flights and airlines flying to the destination\) or chartering flights on large airlines  
or small airplanes to a remote destination. International events often require  
that attendees acquire travel visas from the host country, that the event provide  
attendees with a letter of invitation from the event’s sponsoring organization,  
and/or the event organizer provide a roster of attendees to a government agency  
such as the U.S. State Department to facilitate visa approval \(Silvers 2008, 293\).  
You should also keep abreast of visa and entry requirements through agencies  
such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and communicate these to  
international attendees.  
You might be organizing meet-and-greet services, special baggage handling, shut-  
tle services and/or courtesy cars, and, if handling a group of VIPs or dignitaries, pos-  
sibly assigning a fleet of limousines of varying quality in order of importance. If Transportation  
95  
the event is a conference or convention using numerous hotels for housing \(often  
designated as “citywide”\), a shuttle service running on a continuous or timed  
route between hotels and the convention center might be required, or a shuttle to  
local shopping centers for conference delegates might be needed.  
The transport of goods and supplies to the event site must also be factored into  
the transportation plan. Such transport can involve anything from scheduling  
deliveries to shipping an entire race car, plus all pit equipment, halfway around the  
world. Meeting planners ship meeting supplies to the event site. Event designers have  
décor items shipped in from anywhere around the world. Festival coordinators  
have entire carnivals transported to their events. And a racing team did indeed  
ship several cars and all the requisite pit equipment from North Carolina to  
Australia via FedEx for a single race.  
Ground Transportation  
The professional event coordinator must consider how the out-of-town  
attendees, spectators, or guests will get about once they are at the destination.  
Obviously, ground transportation needs vary greatly, depending on the type and  
scope of the event. The Boston Marathon’s one million spectators and 20,000  
participants will have different challenges than a regional arts and crafts fair  
that attracts 30,000 visitors primarily from the local population, and a transfer  
for a conference group of 1,000 to an off-premise event will be different from  
a transfer for 40 VIPs at a corporate management retreat. Recurring or annual  
events taking place year after year or at the same venue time after time will have  
fewer operational challenges \(it is hoped\), as the transportation logistics have  
been improved with each event. New or temporary event venues or sites need  
special attention, and perhaps professional consultation, to determine the most  
appropriate routes and on-site transportation accommodations such as parking  
areas, ingress and egress, and vehicle capacity and capability.  
Ground operators, transportation providers, destination management com-  
panies \(DMCs\), or professional congress organizers \(PCOs\) might be retained  
to secure or provide the appropriate equipment, coordination, and supervision  
of on-site transportation services. With the exception of the transportation pro-  
vider \(the bus equipment rental company itself\), these companies offer local  
transportation coordination and other local travel needs, including group tours,  
group transfers, shuttle scheduling, and special event arrangements. The profes-  
sional event coordinator or transportation coordinator will consider the number  
of people who need to be transferred \(travel demand\), the times when transfers are  
required, and the types of vehicles suitable for the transfer. Group transfer vehicles  
can include 55-, 47-, or 36-passenger motor coaches, 24-, 15-, or 8-passenger  
shuttle vans, limousines \(regular sedans, stretch, or super-stretch\), or a wide range  
of creative conveyances \(see Figure 4.3\). 96

Checklist  
When planning a group transfer via bus or motor coach, Craven and Golabowski  
\(2001, 182\) note the following factors to be addressed\:  
¢ Where—how far away is the off-site location?  
¢ When—what are the required arrival and departure times?  
¢ How many people are being transported?  
\* Do they all need to arrive/depart at the same time?  
¢ Will it be a single trip or continuous loop?  
¢ Where will the buses stage \(line up\) for pickup and park when at the off-site  
location?  
¢ When should vehicles arrive for pickup at both ends?  
¢ Where will the vehicles pick up and drop off passengers at both ends?  
¢ Will the vehicles be accessible but secured during the event?  
e Will the drivers need to be fed or are they on their own?  
Traffic patterns must also be considered when organizing a large group transfer,  
particularly when dealing with numerous hotels, time-sensitive arrival and depar-  
ture needs, and existing high-density traffic conditions. It is advisable to have your  
transportation company review the traffic patterns and possible route options in  
order to devise the appropriate plan.  
When selecting a transportation provider \(ground operator, DMC, PCO, or  
bus company\), the types of information you should request to determine the  
vendor's suitability include the size of the fleet, the condition of the vehicles, and  
whether the equipment is owned or subcontracted; whether or not the drivers  
have current commercial driver's licenses and the company has a driver drug and  
alcohol testing program; and if the company has its buses inspected annually, the  
company has the required amount of public liability insurance, and the company  
has notification procedures for roadside emergencies and breakdowns \(Federal  
Motor Carrier Safety Administration\).  
Drivers should always be provided with maps and directions and all necessary  
parking passes. They should have capability for wireless two-way communication  
with the dispatcher at all times and, preferably, two-way communication with Transportation  
97  
the event coordinator via cellular phone or radio. All vehicles used for a group  
transfer should have discreet but visible group identification signs in the front and  
door-side windows. You might wish to include step-on guides to give a presenta-  
tion about the destination’s culture or geography, provide onboard refreshments,  
and/or present onboard entertainment.  
Make certain the loading area is apparent \(to both the driver and the riders\) and  
well lit, including the pathway to the loading area. If attendees must have credentials  
or tickets to enter the event venue or site upon arrival, check these credentials as they  
load the bus, not when they get to the event, to facilitate a smooth arrival. There  
should be a staff person from either the event organization or the transportation  
provider to assist with loading and to confirm qualification to board, as well as to  
answer any questions guests might have. To get the guests in the spirit of the event  
to come, theme party favors can be distributed as they board or such items might be  
put on the seats to save time \(assuming the group will be transferred in one move\).  
Traffic Impacts and Implications  
When you have vehicles, you have traffic, and traffic can cause problems for your event,  
or traffic problems might be caused by your event. Traffic congestion is affected by  
the time of day \(rush hour\), and road conditions \(an accident or construction\) or  
can be caused by a competing event drawing vehicles to the same site or crossing  
paths with the route to your event site. Some very large-scale or hallmark events,  
such as the NFL Super Bowl, necessitate changing traffic direction to facilitate  
the flow of large crowds into and out of the event site—all lanes are converted to  
one-way in, then one-way out in the opposite direction. Getz \(1997, 351\) notes  
that large public events often cause a hardship to the surrounding residential or  
commercial areas, resulting from reduced accessibility to establishments and thus  
discouraging local customers from coming near the area. The impact of public  
inconvenience requires careful consideration in planning a large-scale festival or  
civic event and might require significant attention to community relations.  
Work with the appropriate authorities \(i.e., transportation, law enforcement,  
and other public safety agencies\) to arrange the proper traffic management and  
control services and strategies \(see Figure 4.4\). These should be based on the antic-  
ipated arrival and departure patterns—trickle \(arriving/departing at various times  
over the duration of the event\) and dump \(arriving/departing all at the same time\).  
A traffic management plan should address the following \(Latoski et al. 2003\)\:  
\* Site access and parking  
¢ Pedestrian access  
° Traffic flow  
¢ Traffic control  
¢ En-route traveler information  
¢ Traffic surveillance  
° Traffic incident management and safety 98

Traffic Control  
Checklist  
Depending on the size and type of event, the creation of a traffic control plan  
might be mandated prior to receiving the permits and permissions you require to  
stage your event. On-road events such as fun runs or parades will be regulated far  
more strictly than off-road events such as functions inside a purpose-built facility  
or at a site that will not have a significant impact on the general population, but  
you must never assume that an event will not require authorization or traffic man-  
agement assistance from local authorities. They know the business of traffic control  
particular to their area. Signs and route protection equipment, as well as the per-  
sonnel authorized to direct traffic, must conform to the traffic and transportation  
codes of the particular jurisdiction.  
The underlying principle of any traffic control plan must be that you safely  
separate vehicular and pedestrian traffic. This will be particularly important in  
designing the site plan to accommodate the arrivals and departures of the attendees  
or visitors to the event, whether by private car, group transport, or public transit.  
Signage should be designed for the person who has never been to the area or site  
before, giving highway numbers, exit numbers, clear graphic directions, and event  
branding. Signage must be plentiful and positioned so it is visible to those driving  
the vehicles to the event.  
For major events, it might be possible to work with the municipal transporta-  
tion authority to technologically moderate traffic congestion. Many cities employ  
computerized traffic management systems that discern traffic volume, flow,  
and congestion and are able to mitigate congestion through signal adjustment  
\(extended signal time and/or flashing yellow or red\) and variable message signs  
to advise motorists of accidents and alternate routes. In addition, both the event  
organization and the government agency could use their Web sites to advise travelers,  
attendees, and residents of road closures during the event and preferred routes  
particular to the event. Parking  
99  
Public and Mass Transit  
Whenever possible, the professional event coordinator should incorporate and  
encourage the use of public transportation in the event transportation plan as  
well as the marketing plans. This not only alleviates traffic congestion, it also  
reduces the amount of parking space needed at the event site and the pollution  
associated with vehicle emissions. Public or mass transit includes buses, light  
rail, ferries, trolleys, and numerous other public conveyances. When coordinat-  
ing an event that is open to the public, consult with the local transit authority  
about the available services such as direct routes to the event, special routes  
added for the event, special rates for event-goers, and the authority’s ability to  
meet the special needs of disabled riders.  
If the transit authority agrees to become part of the event’s transportation  
plan, you must then confirm the schedules, transit routes, drop-off and pickup  
areas, and transit access to or next to the event site. Once a public transportation  
plan has been determined, promote it as the preferred method of getting to and  
from the event, particularly by setting expectations as to the likely delays to be  
experienced in getting there and when the event concludes—comparing private  
with public transport \(e.g., 90 minutes if you drive, 30 minutes if you ride\).  
Include this in your event marketing strategies by posting and distributing  
public transit routes and schedules, advertising traffic arrangements, and high-  
lighting this information in your public relations campaign. This is a public  
service you are offering, and it is also an excellent public relations tool for com-  
municating the ecological benefits of mass transit and your commitment to a  
healthy environment. “Help the Environment—Ride the Metro” can improve the  
image of the event and the impact of the event.  
# Parking  
For every vehicle coming to an event, there must be a place to put it, even if that  
vehicle is staying for only a brief period of time, such as when dropping off guests  
or delivering supplies. You must think about staging vehicles \(lining them up in  
the necessary order prior to arrival or departure\), accommodating standing vehicles  
\(those waiting, with or without the motor running, for loading, unloading, or  
while occupants are temporarily outside the vehicles\), marshaling vehicles \(providing  
an area where vehicles collect before they are staged or directed to parking spaces\),  
and parking vehicles in specific spaces. You must carefully consider all the parking  
needs, options, and issues in order to develop an efficient and effective parking plan  
based on the size, type, and scope of the event \(see Figure 4.5\). You must determine  
where all the different vehicles coming to the event site will be parked and how  
that parking will be allocated and controlled. 100

Parking Checklist  
Analyze Needs, Capacity, and Capabilities  
Consider the parking needs for the attendees or guests, exhibitors, participants or  
performers, staff and volunteers, suppliers and vendors, as well as the routes and  
parking for emergency vehicles and security services. Parking requirements might  
also include reserved parking for people with special needs, VIPs, sponsors, tour  
buses, or recreational vehicles staying overnight or over a week. You often have to  
find parking for cars, limousines, motor coaches, trucks, delivery vans, a fleet of  
motorcycles, or even media satellite uplink trucks for network broadcast coverage.  
It is important to analyze the expected numbers and types of vehicles likely to  
arrive, as well as evaluate the capacity and quality of space available for parking. You  
might be using a venue that has sufficient parking on the property, or you might  
need to identify remote, adjacent, or creative parking alternatives. You might be  
providing free parking or charging parking fees as a revenue stream. You might  
reserve public or private parking garages, lots, or covered car parks adjacent to the  
event site in advance, perhaps even paying or prepaying all parking fees for your  
guests. You might even arrange to have parking meters bagged to reserve on-street  
parking for limousines or other vehicles. When reserving parking areas or specific  
spaces or floors of a parking garage or structure, you will need to place an attendant  
and post signs so others do not enter.  
If your event is very large or you are creating a temporary parking area, it is  
wise to consult experts to determine the correct layout and site preparation. Open  
fields might have to be mowed and maintained, open spaces might have to be  
graded or evened out, and appropriate space allotment might have to be marked  
with chalk, pylons, paint, or stakes. The entire area might have to be temporar-  
ily fenced or designated with flags or signs. You must also analyze the arrival and Parking  
101  
departure patterns \(i.e., trickle or dump\) to determine peak demand periods and  
the routing and equipment needs, such as barricades or traffic cones.  
Develop a Parking Plan  
The professional event coordinator will create \(or cause to be created\) a parking  
plan that encompasses the appropriate ingress and egress routes, access for equip-  
ment, deliveries, and emergency vehicles, as well as assigned parking areas for  
the various vehicles and personnel coming to the event site. You must work with  
public officials, municipal authorities, venue management, various stakeholders,  
and/or traffic and parking consultants to devise and verify the parking plan. This  
is then incorporated into the overall event plan and budget, including identifying  
and communicating the roles and responsibilities of parking personnel.  
Drop-off and pickup zones and routes should be established for shuttles, tour  
buses, taxicabs, limousines, and other vehicles delivering guests to the event. You  
might arrange for an entrance marquee or plan to have greeters with umbrellas,  
should weather be a concern. You might also designate specific entrance gates or  
routes for different parking areas to mitigate traffic congestion. You might station  
personnel at points of entry to count vehicles as they arrive in order to estimate  
attendance at the event or to determine when vehicles should be redirected to  
another lot.  
Distinct and segregated areas may be designated for different groups, such as  
VIP parking, staff and volunteer parking, exhibitor parking, motor coach or tour  
bus parking, and general public or spectator parking. The designation of these areas  
will most likely be based on the proximity requirements of the assigned group;  
exhibitors and suppliers often need close-in load-in/out access, and VIPs and spon-  
sors will likely be accorded preferential parking. These designated parking areas  
must be clearly identified and the various groups granted special parking privileges  
or areas should be issued different parking passes that authorize entry accordingly.  
Staging and marshaling areas might be required for larger vehicles such as  
trucks or motor coaches. A major trade show could have hundreds of trucks  
arriving, lining up at loading docks, and then needing parking spaces during the  
run of the show. An off-premise party for a convention group could have dozens  
of motor coaches to park while the guests are enjoying the event, which must  
then be lined up for the return to various hotels. Charity or entertainment events  
for which the audience uses taxicabs must establish an efficient staging strategy  
at the close of the event to ensure that the line of taxicabs does not impede other  
traffic or egress. Some tourism events establish parking areas specifically for visi-  
tors driving recreational vehicles or motor homes who wish to stay on or near the  
event site, which may provide a revenue source for the event. These areas might  
be developed with electrical, water, and sewage hookups, and spaces are often  
reserved many months prior to the event. 102 Providing the Event Infrastructure  
Parking Services and Controls  
Depending on the type of event or attendance figures, the professional event coor-  
dinator might decide to \(or be required to\) provide parking personnel such as  
stewards or flaggers to maximize the efficiency of the traffic flow into and out  
of the parking areas. These parking personnel also improve the space usage by  
monitoring the number and positions of empty parking spaces and directing peo-  
ple to park their own vehicles in the available spaces. Arrival and departure modes  
and times, combined with general traffic density, will also indicate how many and  
the types of personnel are necessary, which suggests that an examination of daily  
traffic patterns surrounding the event area should be conducted.  
Parking stewards or flaggers should have distinctive safety clothing, such as  
orange vests with reflective strips, as well as paddles or flags and safety flashlights.  
There should be two-way communication between the stewards or flaggers and  
the supervisor or manager. These parking personnel might be members of an  
adult service organization \(perhaps hired for the price of a donation to their orga-  
nization\), personnel of a contracted professional service, or off-duty uniformed  
police officers. If a service organization or contracted parking service provider is  
engaged, you must confirm who is responsible for liability insurance coverage  
\(you or the organization\) and secure a certificate of insurance from the organization  
or have this coverage added to your policy.  
For upscale events such as charity functions or wedding events, valet parking  
services might be arranged whereby parking attendants collect the car from the  
owner at the event entrance and drive it to a secure parking area until the guest  
is ready to depart. This service, however, does not negate the need for parking  
space arrangements. The parking area for valet-parked vehicles must be secured  
with the appropriate permissions or rental to prevent the towing of unauthorized  
or incorrectly parked vehicles. When contracting a valet parking service, it is also  
important to make certain that the attendants have been appropriately screened  
and trained in the proper operation of all makes of vehicles.  
Other parking services include motorist assistance \(e.g., jump starts for dead  
batteries or unlocking doors for those who locked their keys in a car\), shuttle  
service to and from the event entrance and specific pickup points, and extended  
hours of operation for adjacent parking facilities so that guests will not be rushed  
at the close of the evening \(or find themselves locked out and unable to claim  
their cars\). Again, you might need to secure some of these services from service  
contractors or service organizations, and you must always consider liability and  
confirm that proper insurance coverage is in place.  
Private Property and Public Safety  
No one can assume that he or she may park any type of vehicle anywhere there  
happens to be space. Private property is just that—private—not public. Special Waste Management  
103  
permits may be required for parking areas, particularly for controlled venues such  
as a college campus or stadium property, or for event vehicles parked on city streets.  
Parking may be restricted during certain times of the day or days of the week.  
Event parking may be prohibited in residential areas, and a towing service may  
be required to remove illegally parked vehicles. You might require special permits  
to park a fleet of limousines or to park motor coaches waiting for boarding time.  
Always consider the safety and security of those attending the event, whether  
guests or staff. Parking areas should have adequate lighting, signage, and secu-  
rity to prevent thefts, vandalism, or assault. You might wish to arrange for safety  
escorts for staff or participants leaving the venue in the wee hours of the morning  
\(which is not unusual\), or for security personnel to patrol the parking area in golf  
carts throughout the event. You must ensure that the parking plan complies with  
all municipal legislation, proper insurance coverage is in place, and the appropriate  
warnings or disclaimers \(e.g., “Do not leave valuables in your car,” “Lock your  
vehicle,” “The management is not responsible for . . .”\) are clearly displayed on  
signs and on parking or valet tickets.  
Waste Management  
A primary component of any community infrastructure is a suitable sanitation  
system including waste management, sewage services, and recycling initiatives. It  
is a matter of public health, whether the public is a general population or an event  
population. It is also a cosmetic matter; an event site that is littered with trash and  
debris will not be appealing to guests, nor to important stakeholders. Waste man-  
agement consists of planning for the collection and disposal of all solid, semisolid,  
and liquid waste created at the event.  
Depending on the event site, the professional event coordinator may sim-  
ply confirm the presence of suitable capabilities at a facility or may subcontract  
services to utilize an undeveloped or underdeveloped site \(see Figure 4.6\). One  
might ask why you must consider all these factors if you are using a purpose-  
built or standard venue—can't waste management and toilet facilities be taken for  
granted in these types of venues? You will not know whether the venue is capable  
of accommodating the specific types or volumes of waste unless you confirm its  
capacities and capabilities based on the specific characteristics of your event.  
A festival held on purpose-built fairgrounds might exceed standard amounts of  
waste, requiring additional cleanup crews, receptacles, or scheduled collections.  
A hotel could have separate stationary compacters for wet garbage, dry trash that  
will be incinerated, and recyclables, requiring you to sort materials before disposal.  
Recycling of certain materials is sometimes municipally mandated. The exhibitors  
might leave hundreds of pounds of leftover materials when they pack up their  
booths or stands. The confetti canons or balloon drop used for an exciting finale 104

will leave a layer of debris on the ballroom floor. These contingencies all have  
operational impacts and costs attached that must be factored into the event  
plan and budget.  
You must assess and analyze the waste that will be generated by your event,  
then plan the strategies and secure the appropriate services and equipment for  
controlling, collecting, and disposing of that waste properly. Environmental  
impacts, and certainly budgetary impacts, must often be controlled. You should  
consult with local authorities and make certain your event is in compliance with  
all applicable legislation, as well as communicate your waste management policies  
and procedures to all personnel, participants, and providers.  
Analyze the Trash  
Different events generate different types of waste, based on the purpose, activities,  
audience, and duration of the event. Meetings or conferences may generate more  
paper waste than cooking waste, a food fair or cook-off may produce the reverse.  
Concessionaires at a sports event might be selling beverages in cans or plastic  
cups \(preferably not bottles\), and a health fair might have medical waste such as  
sharps \(needles, syringes, etc.\) used in a child immunization drive or diagnostic  
activities. A park beautification event may have green waste, and a car race may  
generate automotive product waste. You must also consider the odors associated  
with cooking, livestock, toilets, or other aspects of the event or the event site. The  
volume of waste should be calculated by reviewing previous or comparable events,  
as well as analyzing the event elements.  
Toxic and Controlled Waste Issues  
Toxic or hazardous waste must always be disposed of according to prescribed and  
required procedures. Medical and biohazard waste is strictly controlled, including  
sharps \(e.g., needles used by diabetics for insulin injection\), human blood or blood Waste Management  
105  
products, and any infectious solid waste \(discarded materials contaminated with  
blood, excretions, exudates, and secretions from humans or animals with certain  
communicable diseases\). Although these regulations do not pertain to most events,  
some medical events such as training programs or meetings \(or a health fair, as  
mentioned earlier\) require special attention.  
Hazardous household materials, common products used around the home,  
are often used in the context of an event and must be disposed of properly—not  
put in the trash or poured down a drain. Nothing should ever be poured down  
storm drains, as they flow “untreated” into rivers, lakes, or oceans. A substance is  
considered hazardous if it ignites easily, reacts or explodes when mixed with other  
substances, and/or is corrosive or toxic. Check for labels that bear the words caution,  
danger, poison, toxic, and/or warning.  
Trash Collection and Removal  
Sufficient trash receptacles, efficient clearing and cleaning, and properly scheduled  
waste removal must be factored into the site plan and operations. The professional  
event coordinator must work with the venue management and local authorities  
to arrange for waste disposal and recycling containers suitable for the needs of  
the event. Containers might include bins or dumpsters \(named after those of  
the original developer, the Dempster Company, called Dempster Dumpsters\), large  
wheeled carts/dumpsters, trash cans or other litter receptacles, or large roll-off  
containers \(such as those seen at construction sites\) for events requiring holding  
bins. Temporary food service stalls often require covered trash containers.  
You must obtain the sufficient size and number of containers and place them  
in suitable locations so they do not block pedestrian traffic. They must be readily  
accessible at the points where trash is likely to be thrown away, and they must be  
clearly labeled \(e.g., recyclable materials, paper only, or hazardous waste\). You might  
have logo-imprinted trash receptacles created for your event. A crew of volunteers  
or paid personnel is often needed to stroll throughout the event grounds, picking  
up rubbish during the event. You might need to set aside a storage area for exhibitors’  
packing materials.  
The appropriate schedules and routes for waste removal and recycling must be  
confirmed or arranged. If your event is likely to generate more waste than the regu-  
lar trash collection schedule accommodates, you might need to pay for additional  
pickup during or directly following your event. Collection vehicles, particularly  
front-end loaders, can be large and loud, so make sure that they are routed and  
scheduled in such a way that they do not disturb the event or its neighbors and do  
not damage the event grounds. You might need to contractually specify trash  
removal responsibilities with your suppliers, such as requiring off-premise caterers  
remove gray water \(wastewater other than sewage, such as sink or washing drainage,  
also known as sullage\) rather than disposing of it on-site. 106 Providing the Event Infrastructure  
Sanitation and Sewage Requirements  
An event site must comply with all sanitation regulations, which govern everything  
from pest control to portable toilets. Toilet facilities, whether permanent or portable,  
must be considered for every event. Even if there are toilet facilities at the venue you  
are using, are they sufficient for the number of attendees or the event schedule?  
According to Hildreth \(1990, 84\), the statistical average amount of time to go to  
the toilet is five minutes for women and three minutes for men, with air hand-  
driers extending that time by 30 seconds. If everyone is heading for the lavatories  
during a short meeting break or program intermission, there could be long lines  
forming and many frustrated attendees.  
Portable sanitation units may be brought in for undeveloped or underdeveloped  
event sites. These can include anything from single units housed in narrow plastic  
shells to deluxe portable toilet trailers with running water, flush toilets, exhaust  
fans for ventilation, trash receptacles, washbasins, liquid soap dispensers, mirrors,  
fluorescent lights, air-conditioning and heating, and even AM/FM stereo equip-  
ment to play background music. According to Portable Sanitation Association  
International \(www.psai.org\), deluxe trailers requiring water or electrical hookups  
should be positioned within 100 feet \(30.5 m\) of the water/electrical lines, and  
individual units must be placed within 25 feet \(7.6m\) of permanent hard-surface  
roadway for festivals or events where the units are to be serviced daily over several  
days. For big events with a large number of units, the service truck could remain  
on-site to provide continuous standby maintenance service.  
Depending on the event, you might also procure hand-washing stations, shower  
facilities, baby-changing stations, and/or wheelchair-accessible units. The average  
number of sanitation units required is illustrated in Figure 4.7, but you should  
check with local authorities to make certain you have sufficient and appropriate  
equipment based on the size and type of event, as well as the local codes where  
your event is being held. The number of portable toilet units or stalls \(those that  
contain both a seat and a urinal\) required depends on the type, schedule, and  
duration of the event \(there are typically four hours between individual uses\),  
the activities and the audience \(serving alcohol increases the number needed\),  
as well as the ratio of men to women and whether the units are single-sex desig-  
nated, At a minimum, the ratio of single-sex units should be two to one, women  
to men. \(Even if individual units are single-sex designated, in the United States  
particularly, many women will now disregard this designation if waiting lines are  
disproportionate and will commandeer the units as needed.\)  
If there is an elephant in the middle of the room, put a costume on it! People  
will need to use the toilet, so you might as well incorporate it into the overall event  
design. Portable toilets can be procured in various colors to coordinate with a theme,  
to specify single-sex usage, or to identify a particular zone of an event site. They  
could be dressed or concealed with décor such as latticework, fencing, or panels. Waste Management

They should be monitored regularly to make certain they are clean and well stocked  
with the appropriate supplies. You may also need to segregate guest facilities from  
staff and crew facilities by positioning staff toilets out of sight or in a separate tent.  
Creating “Greener” Events  
Conservation and recycling are becoming increasingly important throughout the  
world—and at events. Strategies for conserving water and other natural resources  
should be incorporated throughout the event operations, including recycling and  
environmentally sustainable activities. Recycling activities are characterized by  
three strategies\: reduce, reuse, and recycle \(see Figure 4.8\), which constitute the  
diversion or removal of materials destined for disposal for reprocessing, repurpos-  
ing, and reuse. Recycling reduces disposal costs and might even provide modest  
revenues. Mandatory recycling programs require by law that consumers separate  
trash so that some or all recyclable materials are not burned or dumped into land-  
fills \(see Jennings and Sneed 1996\). Environmentally sustainable activities include  
such things as using biodegradable products and energy-efficient equipment, and  
composting materials such as food and green waste \(see more in Chapter 15\).  
Review the entire event operation to identify recycling opportunities and man-  
dated requirements, and create policies and procedures for implementing waste

Recycling Checklist. control and recycling initiatives. A review of each line item of an event budget can  
reveal possible ways to minimize waste, buy recycled and recyclable materials, and  
donate used and unused items. For instance, an event organization can control waste  
by giving out reusable canvas conference tote bags instead of plastic ones, limiting  
printed handouts or digitizing proceedings at a conference, restricting the use of  
Styrofoam drinking cups and selling reusable plastic commemorative drinking cups  
at a festival, or selecting venues or vendors that practice sound conservation practices.  
You might also institute disincentives, such as financial penalties for exhibi-  
tors who leave their unused printed materials and leftover packing materials, or  
establish a waste management surcharge for food concessionaires who do not use  
recyclable serving materials. These policies, however, must be confirmed with the  
local authorities, the event’s legal advisors, and stakeholders to ensure that they  
are in compliance with all health and safety regulations and that they are legal,  
practical, and culturally permissible.  
# Utiliti  
Virtually all events require sources for power, water, and other utilities. However,  
not all event sites have accessible connections to these sources and some have no  
utilities at all, in which case portable or temporary sources must be procured. Utilities

Even if the event site has plentiful and easy access to power, water, gas, and tele-  
communication lines, there may be a surcharge for their use, particularly in areas  
where consumption is strictly regulated or resources are scarce. The professional  
event coordinator must understand the electrical, water, and gas needs, including  
the volume, proximity, and distribution requirements and the installation, opera-  
tion, and safety restrictions.  
Depending on the event type, scope, site, and its elements, utility needs can  
range from simply the ability to plug in a few electrical appliances to creating  
the infrastructure for a completely self-contained temporary community \(see  
Figure 4.9\). You must assess the capabilities of the event site and compare them  
with the needs of the various products and providers to determine the appropri-  
ate layout of the site and acquire the supplemental systems or equipment needed.  
Electrical Power  
Electricity may be needed at an event simply for plugging in a caterer’s coftee-  
maker, or for lighting an entire city block and powering a dozen carnival rides.  
Our reliance on electrical and electronic appliances makes a reliable power source  
virtually imperative; even the tools used to install the simplest item of décor often  
require electricity. Lighting is required throughout an event site and for its dura-  
tion, including setup and breakdown. Self-contained high-intensity outdoor  
lighting fixtures might use generator power or even solar power battery packs.  
Other items of equipment to consider are the computers used at the registration  
area, inflatable games, audiovisual and entertainment equipment, and even the  
golf carts used to get around the event grounds.  
Potential power fluctuations or outages may dictate that emergency or backup  
systems be in place, either provided by the facility or brought in by the professional  
event coordinator. Consider renting portable power generators, which are avail-  
able in a broad range of sizes and styles, to compensate for power inconsistencies  
or deficiencies. Newer equipment is sound attenuated and very quiet, but older  
equipment can be quite loud and may need to be placed a significant distance

# ON-SITE  
# INSIGHT  
Daniel Mulhern, project manager for the Las Vegas, nieaiaces office of Kohler  
Event Services, notes, “An event coordinator is not required to be a ‘power  
expert’ However, having a basic understanding of power-generated equip-  
ment and technical terminology can be helpful. It’s all about knowing the  
right questions to ask to make servicing your client simple and effective.  
Being acquainted with your power company, along with knowing the essential  
srrennsenccieresttaaeaN HOS RECON LORNA TERENCE  
requirements needed, will assist in making your event a success.” Key questions  
to ask yourself and your clients include the following\:  
e Who actually needs the power? Is it directly with one client? Or, are  
there numerous subclients \(i.e., lighting, sound, catering companies,  
etc.—their needs can differ dramatically\)? Service the entire event!  
e How much power do they need? What are the numbers of amps  
required? What equipment will be running? And how long will the  
equipment be running? Is it stage lighting? A PA system? Or simply a  
55-cup coffeemaker?  
e Where is it going? How far will the end user be from the source? And  
what connections will need to be dropped in between? Keep all local  
event and fire codes in check! Verify any permitting requirements.  
“As a final point, advance planning for power will increase the chances of  
a successful event. Have a site map and production schedule on hand. When  
last-minute changes come up, and you know they always do, you'll be ready to  
react knowing you have the most accurate information about your temporary  
power supply.’  
from the main action of the event, which will require installation of additional  
distribution equipment, such as cables and connectors, to span the distance.  
Portable generators are fuel-powered \(diesel or gasoline\), and the exhaust  
emissions may have to be regulated; their use should certainly be considered  
carefully in terms of proximity to people or animals. In other words, they can  
be noisy and smelly.  
Calculating Power Needs  
Carefully calculate the power needs for each event so you are able to work with  
the venue's electrical engineer or the power provider for an undeveloped or Utilities  
111  
underdeveloped site, to coordinate the required load or pull—the amount of power  
each user will need. Each electrical or electronic device or piece of equipment will  
have specific power consumption specifications, expressed or measured in amps  
\(amperes\); amp is the unit of measurement for electrical current. Amps \(the cur-  
rent\) are calculated by dividing the number of watts \(the quantity of electricity\) by  
the volts \(the pressure at which electric current is delivered\). Voltage will vary in  
different parts of the world; the European standard voltage is 220 V, and the U.S.  
standard is 120 V. Some appliances are rated in kilowatts \(1000 watts per kilowatt\).  
Prepare or collect electrical load sheets, one for each supplier, and forward copies  
to your power supplier or venue electrician to plot the power needs, distribution, and  
equipment. Each supplier should be able to provide you with the total number of  
amps required for the equipment to be used at the event. At the very least, providers  
should be able to identify the wattage rating for each piece of equipment. When  
additional power is required or use of a secondary power source is indicated, por-  
table power generators can be procured. Different sizes of tow-behind portable  
generators can accommodate 20 to 180kW, and trailer-mounted generator packages  
are available up to 2000 kW, each with variable voltage selectors.  
Power Distribution  
Electrical power may be plentiful, but the loads must be distributed appropriately  
to prevent overloading a single source or circuit. A circuit is a complete electri-  
cal path from the electrical supply to the outlet \(or reverse—the international  
term for an outlet\). Electricity is carried and controlled through power distribu-  
tion equipment, such as wires, cables, snakes, circuit breakers, fuses, distribution  
boxes, connectors, and switches \(which are load-rated by their current-carrying  
capacity\), that intakes electricity and routes it to an output device—where you  
plug in. Feeder cables or snakes are used to get the power outlets to where they are  
needed, which can involve miles of cables when the event is large and complex.  
Power lines may be laid on the floor or ground, rigged throughout a ceiling, or  
dropped from above to provide the connections you need. Cables, wires, cords,  
and connectors must be laid carefully and covered with ramps when on the floor  
or ground to ensure that they do not become a slip-and-trip hazard and that they  
are protected from damage.  
Water  
The water needs of an event can range from bottled water for 50 meeting attend-  
ees to cups of water on tables stationed along a route for thousands of marathon  
runners, or running water for sanitation accommodations to the cooling mecha-  
nisms for decorative laser light displays. For outdoor or temporary sites using food  
concessions or off-premise caterers, sufficient potable \(safe to drink\) water must  
be available for food preparation, cleaning, sanitizing utensils and equipment, and 112 Providing the Event Infrastructure  
hand washing. Potable water may also be required for portable toilets and showers,  
or for evaporative cooling mechanisms such as misters or sprinklers. You may  
need to have trucks spray nonpotable water on a dirt playing field or parking  
lot to reduce dust prior to the event each day. Standby water trucks could be  
required for fire protection.  
You should identify the location and capabilities of water sources and connec-  
tions. If suitable water connections are not available, potable water must be sup-  
plied by means of approved water-holding tanks, containers, or other equipment.  
This could include portable bottled water drinking fountains/coolers, 5-gallon  
jugs, water tanks, or tanker trucks. It may be possible to tap into a water supply by  
means of an adjacent fire hydrant \(with permission from the local fire department  
or other authorities\). Sufficient drinking water must be available at all times; dehy-  
dration is a critical health issue at events, particularly outdoor events occurring in  
hot weather. Even mild dehydration can affect one’s metabolism and trigger fuzzy  
short-term memory \(www.bottledwaterweb.com\).  
As with other waste management applications, you must plan for the disposal  
of all wastewater, including drainage of groundwater. This is a health and a safety  
issue. Water connections and hoses must be suitable and sufficient for the intended  
uses and monitored for leakage and condition. Keep in mind that water and electric-  
ity do not mix. Their connections and lines must be safely segregated.  
Gas  
The gas needs of an event can range from diesel fuel for portable generators to  
propane for heaters or cooking equipment, or even a tank of helium to inflate  
decorative balloons. A hot air balloon uses propane to heat the air inside the bal-  
loon to keep it aloft. Many buildings use natural gas heating systems and kitchen  
equipment. A number of vehicles now use natural gas for fuel. Some events offer  
“oxygen bars,” where guests can inhale to their hearts’ content. Most gases, how-  
ever, are toxic, and the professional event coordinator must make certain that the  
areas in which gas-powered equipment is used are well ventilated and that the  
containers for the gases are properly secured. A helium tank can become a lethal  
missile if the cap is dislodged. The event coordinator must work closely with the  
site management, vendors, and local authorities to make certain all gas utilities are  
installed to code and operated correctly.  
Environmental Controls—HVAC  
The ambient atmosphere of the event site will have an impact on the success of  
the event. If the event space is too hot, cold, humid, arid, breezy, or still, the  
event will suffer, as will the audience—those who attend and endure the condi-  
tions. Controlling the climatic atmosphere will raise enjoyment levels and increase Utilities  
113  
productivity. The professional event coordinator should become familiar with  
a venue’s heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning \(HVAC\) systems and their  
controls to be able to modify the atmosphere within a meeting or function room  
properly.  
Ventilation systems circulate air. The air coming in should be fresh \(from the  
outside\), and the air extracted expelled outside so that the system is not simply  
recirculating stale air. This is especially important if there will be smoke from  
cigarettes, cigars, cooking, or special effects such as fog machines or indoor pyro-  
technics. You may need to increase the ventilation or add special filters so as not  
to set off smoke alarms, and you should make certain that you do not block any  
vents with décor or equipment.  
Controlling the atmosphere in a temporary structure or tent may require por-  
table HVAC equipment such as heaters, air-conditioning units, evaporative cool-  
ers, and fans. The American Rental Association \(www.ararental.org\) advises that  
there are generally two types of tent heaters—direct-fired, such as the tall patio  
heaters with aluminum umbrellas that reflect heat downward, and indirect-fired  
units including heat exchangers that allow fumes to vent away from the heated  
area. Cooling options include air-conditioning units and evaporative cooling sys-  
tems. Selecting the right heating or cooling system depends on the size and posi-  
tion of the tent or temporary structure, the time of day and time of year, and the  
atmospheric conditions outside.  
# Telecommunications  
Given the ubiquitous nature of cellular phones and event-goers’ reliance on constant  
communication capability, the professional event coordinator must confirm the  
availability and capacity of telecommunications resources. The telecommunica-  
tions needs of an event will vary according to the type of event and client needs.  
Public festivals may need extra telephone lines for portable automated teller  
machines \(ATMs\). An out-of-town client may need a temporary combination cel-  
lular telephone and two-way radio while on-site. Most meetings or conventions  
require both wired and wireless means of communications, including high-speed  
dedicated LAN \(local area network\) telephone lines \(e.g., T1 or T3\) and Wi-Fi  
\(wireless fidelity\) Internet connectivity.  
Telephone and telecommunications lines may be available or accessible, depend-  
ing on the facility in which the event is taking place. Some facilities have existing  
lines or connections you can plug into, and others have contractual agreements  
with specific service providers for temporary telecommunications equipment and  
access. Wireless devices might not work in some facilities or certain parts thereof  
due to location or the building’s construction, and some may interrupt certain  
audiovisual equipment \(and some pyrotechnic firing devices\). High demand on  
Wi-Fi Internet networks will affect the speed of or disrupt an Internet connection. 114 Providing the Event Infrastructure  
Cost Controls  
The use of utilities may be included in the rental fees for the venue, or you may be  
charged for the amounts used. It is not uncommon to have a surcharge on electric-  
ity usage, and the surcharge may be based on the total amount of electrical power  
used or the power used during certain times of the day. You might wish to compare  
the cost difference between the in-house power charges and bringing in a portable  
generator system, particularly during peak times of use. You might also decide that  
ordering back-up equipment is necessary to ensure an uninterrupted power source.  
Telephone charges and Wi-Fi access fees are customary, but you might be able to  
negotiate lower rates or compare costs for procuring a service provider other than the  
one the facility uses \(if permissible\). Due to the high cost of hotel pricing on high-  
speed Internet connectivity, many event professionals are using 3G and 4G wireless  
air cards that also give them free “hot-spots” in many public areas \(Hogg 2010\).  
If there are usage fees, make certain you understand how that usage will be  
measured and monitor those measurements throughout the duration of the event.  
Make certain these charges are separated on the invoice or master bill so that you  
can address any discrepancies as well as develop a usage profile for future events.  
You should survey and brainstorm with your suppliers to determine conservation  
and efficiency strategies for cost savings in conjunction with utility usage.  
Installation, Operation, and Safety Inspections  
The site selected for an event should be examined to determine the power and  
other utility capabilities, including the number and locations of outlets, the  
capacities, the distribution requirements, and the backup systems in case of a  
power failure. Depending on the event and its power needs, you may consult  
with the local power authorities, building maintenance personnel or engineer,  
or subcontracted service providers. You might arrange for a standby electrician  
throughout the duration of your event or specify that an on-site technician or  
technicians be included in the quote for temporary power services.  
Undeveloped or underdeveloped sites could require official site inspections  
prior to use to determine the capabilities and equipment needed to produce the  
event as designed. Additional inspections may then be necessary once the utili-  
ties are installed, to ensure that the installation is up to code, the equipment is in  
proper working order, and the access or perimeters are properly restricted. Such  
inspection must be factored into the use of an unusual or onetime event site, par-  
ticularly in regard to the budget, timeline, and site layout.  
The installation, operation, and dismantling of utilities should always be left  
to professionals. Unless you are a licensed electrician, you do not want to be  
meddling with electrical power configurations and connections. In fact, some  
jurisdictions require a portable power provider to have an electrical contractor  
license, and many jurisdictions require permits for specific electrical supply uses Labor and Labor Unions 115  
\(e.g., pulling power from an adjacent building\). The same may apply in regard to  
installing or utilizing gas or water utilities.  
In some jurisdictions, all the installation, operation, and dismantling of utilities,  
as well as other aspects of the event setup, require that specific labor unions do all the  
work. The professional event coordinator must understand these jurisdictional require-  
ments in order to get the workers needed to bring the event environment to life.  
Labor and Labor Unions  
Labor refers to contracted workers who perform services, who may come from a  
union or specialized labor-for-hire agency. They may be skilled union craftspersons  
or they may be readymen \(nonunion, temporary labor hired from a personnel  
agency\). They may be secured through the venue, a supplier, the client or host, or  
a government employment bureau. You might be required to use union workers  
or venue-supplied workers exclusively and to abide by the specific employment  
practices of that union or venue \(e.g., minimum hours, wages, overtime rates,  
and working conditions\). Even if not mandated, union workers might be the best  
workers for the job because of their training and expertise. Union labor issues, in  
regard to events, most often relate to exposition events, but they can affect other  
special events and entertainment productions as well \(see Figure 4.10\).  
A union is an organization of workers formed for mutual protection and for  
the purpose of dealing collectively with their employers on issues related to wages,  
working conditions, and other work rules pertaining to their employment. They  
were established to control fair labor practices and working conditions. Sometimes

they are used to control how work will be performed, which has both good and  
bad effects. There are many stories about having.to pay a union worker an exorbitant  
amount to plug in and turn on a lamp or string an extension cord, but from the  
previous discussion, you should realize that one cannot simply plug anything in just  
anywhere; laying an extension cord must be done according to safety specifications.  
Although excesses do occur, such as featherbedding \(make-work practices requiring  
more workers than necessary or requiring unnecessary work\), adherence to labor  
union requirements is a sound risk management practice.  
Union Jurisdictions  
In some locations, using union labor is mandated and different unions may rep-  
resent workers who perform different functions, known as jurisdictions. A union  
jurisdiction is the specific industry, craft, and/or geographical area for which a  
local union is chartered to organize or represent. You may be dealing with a craft  
union representing individuals possessing or working at a specific skill or trade  
such as carpentry or plumbing, or an industrial/vertical union whose member-  
ship includes all workers in a particular industry regardless of particular skills or  
occupation. You might deal with teamsters for the transport of materials to the  
event site; an expo union for the drayage \(using forklifts and other heavy equip-  
ment to move materials from the dock to the event or exhibit space\); stagehands  
or carpenters for assembling and installing the exhibit or décor; electricians for  
assembling and maintaining electrical fixtures and other heating, lighting, and  
power systems; plumbers to install water, gas, or water disposal systems; riggers,  
who use equipment to move, place, or attach machinery or displays; and porters  
or maintenance workers to sweep, clean, and dust.  
You might be required to use union labor for only certain specific tasks or for  
all the work within a facility. The facility may be a union shop \(all employees  
must belong to a union\) or an open shop \(union membership is not a condition  
of employment\). Some locations in the United States are in right-to-work states,  
which have passed legislation mandating that joining a union can not be required  
as a condition of employment. There may be a jurisdictional dispute as to which  
union's members will perform a certain type of work, and you might not be deal-  
ing with the same union in different locations.  
Identify Labor Needs and Costs  
The professional event coordinator should carefully estimate labor needs and  
schedules, and then incorporate this information into the applicable labor regu-  
lations. Some unions require a minimum of four hours’ work. Some regulations  
specify how long a worker may work and when meals and breaks must be taken.  
Different types of union workers have different straight-time pay rates, the  
base wage. Overtime, time-and-a-half, and double-time wage rates may apply, Labor and Labor Unions  
117  
particularly when workers are scheduled for long hours, after regular hours, or dur-  
ing holidays. It may be more cost-effective to hire the venue an extra day or two rather  
than pay the increased wage rates for premium pay conditions. An event coordi-  
nator certainly wants to avoid paying for dead time \(when a laborer is on the job  
but unable to work or waiting because of factors beyond his or her control\) or  
reporting pay \(guaranteed payment when a worker reports for a job as specified  
but finds no work to be done\).  
Payment of wages might be made through the union or agency, or directly to the  
worker. At all times, however, you must comply with all the applicable labor laws,  
rules, and regulations regarding employment taxes, working conditions, and/  
or employee benefits. For temporary staffing or labor from a personnel agency  
or supplier, the hourly rate typically includes the costs of payroll bookkeeping,  
employment taxes, and other administrative necessities. It is wise to confirm the  
company’s references and financial condition, as well as the training it provides,  
so that the event organization does not become liable for taxes through default of  
the supplier. It is also wise to check with the venue management during your site  
inspections to determine when union contracts are due to be renegotiated, as such  
timing may indicate the possibility of disputes or strikes that could affect your  
ability to install and produce the event.  
Union Hierarchies  
Unions often have a specific hierarchy, including who supervises whom and  
specific conflict resolution protocols, which you must respect and follow. You  
may initially be dealing with the union’s business agent, the official at the top of  
the hierarchy, to establish the labor requirements and work rules for the event,  
including the labor call—the number of laborers and skill level \(e.g., journey-  
man, apprentice, or semiskilled\), the ratio of supervisors or job foremen, floaters,  
dispatchers, leadman specifications, and the tasks to be completed. You may  
need journeymen \(those who have successfully completed an apprenticeship in  
a skilled trade\) or semiskilled labor \(whose performance will not cause excessive  
damage to a product or equipment\).  
You may select workers via a hiring hall \(the union and/or employer dispatch-  
ing workers to a job as needed\), or you may select the workers sent by a union  
referral whereby applicants are referred to the employer rather than selected by the  
union. On the job site, you will deal with the shop steward \(or stewards\) in charge  
of the rank and file—the union members. All grievances or dissatisfaction, either  
employer’s or employees’, should be communicated through the union steward.  
You should get written guidelines and work rules from the applicable union  
and plan to comply with them to the letter. Work with the venue, general services  
contractor, and/or local officials to determine the union requirements and your labor  
options. You might be able to subcontract your own union workers who hold 118 Providing the Event Infrastructure  
permit cards from a separate or different union and still be in compliance with  
union jurisdictional requirements.  
Build Positive Relationships  
The professional event coordinator must define and communicate the job  
expectations and provide the tools, training, and orientation necessary for each  
worker to do his or her job in an atmosphere of mutual respect and communal  
achievement. Whether hired or inherited, casual laborers or union workers, you  
must develop an effective, honest, and mutually beneficial relationship with these  
workers. Respect, communication, recognition, and reward are the cornerstones  
of good labor relations.  
Bringing an event to life is hard work. Setting up an event can involve a hand-  
ful of friends and family for a personal celebration or hundreds \(or thousands\)  
of hired workers for a large convention or public festival, but these people are all  
working toward the successful implementation of the event vision. They must be  
motivated and engaged in the successful outcome of the event project. Whether  
paid or volunteer, part-time or full-time, each person should be treated as a valued  
participant in the project.  
Wrap Up  
An event site is a microcosmic community requiring an infrastructure similar to  
that of any municipality to ensure the quality of life at the event. It must have an  
effective transportation system, sufficient facilities for parking and people, sanitary  
conditions, utilities, and ample labor resources. Transportation needs must be  
addressed for both getting to the event destination or locale and getting to and  
around the event site, which can involve public and private transport providers  
and the impact of such transportation on the surrounding community.  
Comprehensive assessment and planning must be done to ensure that the facilities  
for people and vehicles are appropriate and in compliance with all local, regional,  
and national legislation. Parking plans and services must be sensitive to the needs  
of the event’s neighbors as well as the event-goers and must reflect the nature and  
purpose of the event. Waste management and sanitation requirements must be  
meticulously addressed to ensure a healthy and safe environment. The essential  
utilities must be confirmed or imported to make the event site fully functional,  
and the appropriate labor force must be procured to bring the event to life.  
There are numerous creative opportunities for providing this infrastructure.  
The professional event coordinator must make certain that these basic human  
services and human resources are in place. They are either invisible because  
they are coordinated so flawlessly, or they are integrated, when appropriate, into the Wrap Up  
119  
design aspects of the event to provide a visible expression of the goals and objec-  
tives of the event and the event organization.

EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Outline and describe the infrastructure requirements and plans, including  
transportation, parking, waste management, utilities, and labor, for each of the  
following events.  
A. Your community has decided to create a festival celebrating its cultural  
heritage in an effort to build tourism during its slowest season. It will take  
place over two weekends and include an opening day parade, daytime  
exhibits and activities, food concessions and a cook-off competition, and  
evening entertainment attractions. This first year you expect an attendance  
of 25,000 local people and 5,000 tourists.  
You are coordinating a three-day regional Health and Wellness Exposition,  
sponsored by the three health maintenance organizations \(HMOs\) serving  
your region. Each HMO will have a large display area and will be offering free  
diagnostic and immunization clinics to the attendees. This gate show will  
also have 100 other exhibitors, ranging from health food restaurants giving  
out samples to spa dealers displaying hot tubs and Jacuzzis.  
A local corporation has hired you to coordinate an employee appreciation  
party for 1,000 guests to be held this summer at the sports fields on a local  
school campus. It will start at 4\:00 in the afternoon and end at midnight and  
will feature outdoor carnival and inflatable games until sunset and disco  
dancing in a tent after dark. A barbecue dinner will be served at 6\:30 p.m.,  
and snacks and beverages will be available throughout the event. 120 Providing the Event Infrastructure

ANTICIPATION AND ARRIVAL  
If pleasures are greatest in anticipation, just  
remember that this is also true of troubles.  
—Elbert Hubbard, American publisher \(1856-1915\)  
For the most part I started my “world” travels in 2000 when I went to Jordan,  
Bethlehem, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa to present event manage-  
ment programs on behalf of The George Washington University. Although my  
excitement regarding experiencing these unique locales was high, my anxieties  
were even higher—I was terrified. I knew where I was going and why, but I had  
no idea what J would find when I got there.  
It is the unknown that most people fear or avoid, and it is what will stop  
people from taking part in your events. Therefore, you need to help them make  
the unfamiliar desirable by making it recognizable, and then make certain they  
are welcomed with excellent customer service throughout their experience. You  
need to understand why they would want to attend, be familiar with what ques-  
tions they will have, and be aware of the things that you simply take for granted.  
Nothing should be considered self-evident or hidden from the first-time or even  
long-time attendee.  
The following chapter discusses the strategies and opportunities for identify-  
ing, attracting, and welcoming your event audience by anticipating both their  
desires and their anxieties; making the unknown known to all those you would  
like to attend.

# Accommodating  
the Audience  
Social media is like word of mouth on steroids.  
\~\~—Marta Kagan, American marketing executive  
In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
Determine and procure suitable and effective collateral materials that  
will support the marketing strategies of an event.  
Select and organize appropriate registration, admission control, and  
guest greeting systems for an event.  
Create and implement appropriate event accreditation and  
credentialing procedures for participants, providers, patrons, and the  
media.  
Develop effective and efficient seating systems to accommodate an  
event audience.  
Identify and coordinate attendee and VIP services and protocol  
requirements as appropriate.

he event coordinator was checking on the welcome desk during registration for  
a large employee gathering when she noticed one of her staff and a guest in  
what appeared to be a heated discussion. The event coordinator asked another staff  
member to step in and handle the guest's complaint, took the fuming registrar to the  
staff lounge, sat her down with a cool soft drink, and listened to her recount the unrea-  
sonable demands of the guest. Then calmly and quietly, the event coordinator said,  
“| completely understand your frustration; however, we have to remember we are in  
the hospitality industry, not the hostility industry.\*

Accommodating the event audience depends on customer service, and good  
customer service is always measured from the customer's point of view. From the  
first announcement, creating anticipation, to the final departure and afterglow,  
the professional event coordinator has countless opportunities to create a memo-  
rable experience for every customer by considering and controlling moments  
of truth. According to Anderson and Zemke \(1991, 17\), “A Moment of Truth  
occurs anytime a customer comes in contact with any part of your organization  
and uses that contact to judge the quality of the organization.” Beginning with  
initial communications and dealings with frontline employees, then continu-  
ing with encounters with parking attendants, janitorial staff, service providers,  
and product suppliers—each interaction with the event, the event team, or the  
event environment contributes to the event experience and signifies a potential  
moment of truth.  
Whether they are called attendees, customers, delegates, festival-goers, guests,  
participants, the public, spectators, or visitors, the audience for your event is the  
reason your event is taking place. No audience—no event. The treatment each  
individual receives will determine the level of success for the event, because those  
individual experiences add up to a collective experience that the audience either  
enjoys or endures. Each person in attendance is likely to interact with others, and  
with this interaction comes influence; a bad experience will be told and retold,  
which has the potential for changing another individual’s perception of his or her  
own experience. Bad news travels fast, and misery loves company. Attracting the Audience  
125  
Attracting the Audience  
As marketing gurus have been proclaiming for years, customer satisfaction isn’t the  
main thing; it is the ov/y thing. Thus, the professional event coordinator must view  
the event experience from threshold to threshold and make certain the customer's  
experience meets \(and exceeds\) his or her expectations. The critical component of  
this effort is to establish the appropriate expectations through effective communica-  
tions and marketing materials. The type, quality, and format of the event's collateral  
materials will depend on the type, scope, and budget of the event \(see Figure 5.1\).

Collateral Materials 126 Accommodating the Audience  
Interest, Inform, Invest  
The purpose of an event's collateral materials is to create interest in the event and  
provide information about the event so that the customer will decide to invest in  
\(attend\) the event. Terry G. Vavra and Douglas R. Pruden \(in Zemke and Woods  
1998, 41, 81\) explain, “It has long been accepted that in making a purchase  
decision, consumers pass through a series of stages of varying investigation and  
commitment . . . a buying decision process . . . often defined by the stages of  
awareness, interest, desire, and action \(purchase\).” These stages are often described  
by the acronym AIDA.  
The collateral materials for an event provide a medium for communication  
and must offer sufficient information, in an interesting format, to facilitate the  
purchase of and participation in the event. These materials could include advertis-  
ing items, direct mail pieces, publicity materials, or amenities, and may be printed  
or in digital form. The style and quality of collateral materials will communicate  
certain things about the event as well. Glossy brochures might enhance the per-  
ceived value of a conference event. Hand-done calligraphy on invitations to a gala  
fundraiser communicate exclusivity and elegance. There is a possible downside  
as well; the glossy brochure or expensive invitation might suggest that you have  
spent too much money on it\: “Oh, that’s why the conference is so expensive” or  
“Youre wasting money that should go to the charity’s programs.”  
Establishing Expectations  
Steve Schwartz, senior research policy manager at the Washington, D.C.,  
Convention Center and former instructor at the George Washington University  
Event Management Certificate Program, has suggested that people do not mea-  
sure their experience at an event against their last event experience, but against  
their best event experience. A realistic approach is to establish appropriate expec-  
tations with the customer from the beginning—then overdeliver. Establishing  
service expectations and experience expectations may be accomplished through  
well-designed collateral materials.  
Keep in mind that any and all promotional or collateral materials created  
for an event might be considered part of a legally enforceable contract between  
the event producer and the attendee. You must be able to provide what you  
said you would provide, at the price you said it would cost, delivered when  
you said it would be delivered. Do not make claims you cannot substantiate or  
promises you cannot keep \(or do not intend to keep\). If something is “subject to  
change” —say so. The use of disclaimers will not only protect you and your event  
organization from unhappy or litigious customers, it will give the customer the  
“truth” about what to expect and allow the customer to make an informed pur-  
chase decision. Attracting the Audience  
127  
Building Excitement  
Many event collateral materials are a form of promotion, meant to stimulate the poten-  
tial attendee to act—to purchase the event ticket or “buy” the event concept and  
attend. People’s decisions to buy are most often based on emotion rather than logic,  
and on perception rather than reality; therefore, according to Briggs \(2001, 94\), the  
event marketing materials should focus on the benefits of attendance \(e.g., fun, status,  
job security\) rather than its features. Target the potential customer or attendee’s  
wants and desires, matching them to the benefits of the event experience to be had.  
Identify the benefits or problem solutions your event will deliver and highlight  
them in your materials.  
It usually requires numerous impressions \(visual or auditory contacts\) for an  
advertising or promotional message to interest, inform, and instigate action. This is  
why an integrated and multilevel approach might be necessary to create and build  
excitement for your event, resulting in audience attendance. For example, meetings  
and conventions often use “save the date” or teaser postcards eight to ten months  
before an event, followed by a brochure outlining the preliminary program four to  
six months out, sending the final brochure with the final program outline and list of  
speakers plus registration forms two to four months out, and, finally, following up  
with a reminder two to six weeks before the event. The timing, of course, depends  
on the timeline and type of conference; annual conventions and conferences may  
require a different schedule than onetime or periodic congresses or symposiums.  
Incentive programs use this multitiered approach with collateral materials  
to continuously motivate employees throughout the duration of the program,  
providing encouragement and building excitement. The program starts with an  
informational brochure outlining the objectives, the incentive trip to be won, and  
what it will take to win it. This is followed by periodic messages \(printed or digital\)  
and advertising specialties to reinforce the participant’s objective—to achieve the  
sales or productivity increase needed to win the travel reward.  
Festivals and sports events usually orchestrate a public relations and promo-  
tions calendar leading up to an event, including media kits and communiqués,  
sponsorship solicitation materials, bill stuffers \(flyers or brochures included in  
utility bills or bank statements\), souvenir/collectable posters and programs, con-  
tests and stunts at which leaflets or coupons are distributed, and numerous other  
promotions. These efforts are often augmented with paid advertising close to the  
event to further build awareness, excitement, and urgency to purchase.  
These materials and tactics must be designed and planned from the inception of  
the event to ensure they communicate the correct message in the correct mediums at the  
correct times so that they will be cost-effective and build excitement at the correct pace.  
As one advertising executive told me, “You have to be in front of the customer when  
that customer is ready to make that purchase.” This integrated approach also allows the  
professional event coordinator or marketer to develop an integrated and cohesive look  
or style for the collateral materials to create a repetitive and cumulative impression. 128 Accommodating the Audience  
Graphic Design and Branding  
The collateral you create for an event could include souvenirs such as pins, printed  
cups and napkins, place cards, T-shirts, and other promotional items, plus numerous  
forms, newsletters, business cards, or even smart cards \(cards with a magnetic strip  
or chip, similar to a credit card, often used in an electronic lead retrieval system\).  
Anything associated with an event that is printed, imprinted, or digitized should  
have a uniform and recognizable image. All collateral materials should incorporate  
the theme or logo of the event with a consistent style and placement. Symbols,  
logos, or graphic representations associated with the event or an event organization  
are a form of “branding,” projecting an image and linking the product \(the event\)  
with an easily recognizable and consistent perception of value to the consumer.  
Policies governing the logo and design should be crafted to ensure the integrity  
of the branding images associated with an event or event organization. The profes-  
sional event coordinator should create a design checklist that includes the key images  
and information to be included in all collateral materials \(see Figure 5.2\), as well as  
cautions and restrictions. Imagine the branding image conveyed when a local festival  
was ecstatic to have its logo incorporated into all the city’s communications, only  
to find that a warning memo from the hazardous waste department faxed to all city  
employees had a large skull and crossbones linked with its festival name and logo.  
You must schedule the printing of your collateral materials into your timeline.  
Printing can take up to eight weeks or more, depending on the complexity of the  
job, and you should not sacrifice your ability to proof and approve each stage  
in the process. Proofing is critical \(for both printed and digital materials\). Not  
only should you be checking for any spelling or grammatical errors early in the  
process, you should also be checking for consistency in style \(i.e., use of capital

placement and proximity, correct captions with photos, and double-checking on  
the spelling of names. Of course, the copy you give the graphic artist or printer  
must start out well proofed \(you pay for your mistakes; the printer pays for printer  
errors\). As you proceed through each step in the printing process, changes become  
increasingly more expensive. Any changes after the blueline \(the final proof copy  
before printing\) stage might be as expensive as starting over.  
Creative Invitations  
Invitation design has become an art form. For gatherings ranging from life-  
cycle to cause-related events and retail events to reunions, invitations are used  
to personally request the pleasure of an individual’s company. The more creative,  
unusual, or outstanding the invitation, the more likely its recipient will be to con-  
sider attendance or participation. It is important to understand that even the most  
worthy cause or significant celebration is competing for a person’s limited time. A  
creative and persuasive invitation helps to communicate that attendance will be  
well worth the time \(and/or money\) invested. This is where the unique, unusual,  
and extraordinary papers, shapes, packaging, and delivery should be considered.  
\(Avoid any glitter, sprinkles, or powdery substance as an enclosure.\) Exceptional  
invitations may provide a nonprofit or retail event with a better market share than  
competing events, or corporate events with an innovative branding opportunity.  
If truly unique, it is possible that the invitation will create a high profile for the  
event and even reap media coverage or publicity as an award-winning design.  
Marketing Communications Technology  
Although some professional event coordinators and marketers believe that the  
physical, printed item, such as a brochure or registration packet, provides the tan-  
gible evidence of the event experience purchased or to be purchased \(Briggs 2001,  
149-150\), the trend is toward the Internet and e-mail for reasons of cost and  
speed \(Middleton 2001, 285\). Not only does digital transmission of marketing  
and other collateral materials save time and money, it also eliminates waste and  
reduces environmental impact. Most of the typical event collateral \(Figure 5.1\)  
can be distributed electronically, which has the potential added benefit of being  
redistributed to an even greater audience.  
The infrastructure of the Internet and other communications and digital technol-  
ogies has made electronic alternatives to printed collateral the marketing mediums of  
this millennium. Electronic and Web-based mediums available to the event marketer  
now include blogs, chat groups, cybercafés and kiosks, digital video, e-mail, Internet-  
enabled cellular phones and personal digital assistants \(PDAs\), live and on-demand  
Webcasts and podcasts, social media, and Web sites. In addition, there has been a  
convergence of accreditation and mobile phone technology wherein smartphones 130 Accommodating the Audience  
\(e.g., BlackBerry, iPhone, etc.\) have the ability to produce a bar code that can function  
as a boarding pass on airlines or enable admission to events \(Hogg 2010\).  
Web sites are practically mandatory for most public events—and many private  
ones as well. An event Web site can be used to provide an electronic brochure,  
conduct online registration, sell tickets and collect fees, sell souvenirs, sign up  
volunteers, poll delegates, conduct evaluations and marketing surveys, supply  
maps and directions, provide directories, recognize sponsors, issue coupons, build  
membership and/or mailing lists, extend the event through postevent highlights  
and encapsulated proceedings to increase retention, create pre- and postevent dis-  
cussion forums, conduct interactive sessions with remote audiences, and perform  
countless other functions yet to be discovered.  
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others build,  
and are built on, communities of interest. Not only do they facilitate “word-of-  
mouse” or viral marketing, they can engage your audience constituencies in an  
interactive manner. When using these platforms to promote your event, remem-  
ber that they are like having a conversation. At least 95 percent of your posts  
should provide content that has educational or informational value rather than  
“advertisements” or your posts will quickly lose credibility.  
Digital videos can be posted on video sharing sites such as You lube, Flickr, and  
others, as well as on the event’s Web site, which can include interviews with fea-  
tured speakers, personalized invitations from the bride and groom or a company’s  
CEO, previews of scheduled entertainment, testimonials from previous attendees  
or scenes from the previous event, virtual tours of the event site, and numerous  
other enticements. Social networking strategist David Nour \(2009\) notes that  
there are, as of this writing, more than 400 social networking technologies avail-  
able and the technology is changing and growing on an almost daily basis.  
All these mediums have been merged through the use of smartphones and  
WebOS \(a graphical interface mobile operating system\) phone applications \(apps\)  
that are integrating people with the “flow” of their digital data, including regis-  
tration for the conference, individual sessions, biographies on the speakers and  
participants, generating individual conference agendas tailored to each registrant,  
and posting and generating content instantaneously and collaboratively using one  
handheld device \(Hogg 2010\). You should become familiar with the most popu-  
lar and audience-specific options; then use these to enhance achievement of the  
event's marketing and customer service objectives.  
# Registration  
A registration system will be required for any event at which you need to col-  
lect information from the attendee or participant. The most common event genre  
using a registration system is the conference or convention event, but registration Registration  
131  
systems are also used at sports events \(athletes and media\), expositions \(exhibitors  
and buyers\), marketing events \(familiarization tours or hospitality suites\), govern-  
ment events \(security clearances\), reunion events, and numerous other gatherings.  
The professional event coordinator must ensure that the registration procedures  
and on-site logistics meet the needs of the attendee as well as the event organization.  
Efficient and effective systems must be in place to handle the size and type of  
audience expected and the functions required. Frequently, preregistration activities  
are conducted prior to the event, with additional on-site registration or check-in  
functions. You might be collecting personal data or distributing collateral materi-  
als. You might be serving attendees from the local area or from around the world.  
Thus, registration is part of customer service, and often the first moment of truth.  
First Impressions  
How the registration process is managed—either prior to the event or on-site—  
gives a lasting first impression of the event, the event organization, and how the  
attendee can expect to be treated throughout the event experience. The procedure  
must be well organized, efficient, and easy for the individual registering. There are  
numerous techniques and technical equipment options available to accomplish  
this, including computerized registration systems, integrated database functions,  
on-site Internet kiosks, and attractive, useful registration collateral.  
Registration forms, either physical or digital, must be quick and easy to fill out.  
They should be designed in such a way that instructions are clear and information is  
requested in a logical progression. Event branding should be included to reinforce the  
image of the event, and all rules, regulations, or restrictions should be clearly displayed.  
Specify what to “do next” by clearly explaining how, where, and when forms must be  
submitted. Acknowledge receipt of the registrations in some manner, either with an  
e-mail notification, postcard, letter, receipt, packet, or ticket. On-site, have materials  
organized and ready to be picked up, as well as systems to handle on-site registrations.  
Get the Information You Need  
The basic information to be collected includes name, mailing and e-mail addresses,  
contact numbers, special needs or dietary requirements, package or sessions  
selected, and payment method. Beyond that, depending on the type of event, you  
can request personal information such as age, income level, education level, food  
or travel preferences, clothing size \(if you are giving out T-shirts or other limited-  
edition clothing\), or opinions about issues or practices to be covered at your event.  
The collection of this information must not be intrusive—collect only that  
information you need and specify how it will be used. You might choose to make  
some information mandatory for registration, and other requested information  
optional. All information collected should be considered private and should not 132 Accommodating the Audience  
be released to outside organizations. If your practice is to sell your information  
for other direct marketing activities, you must reveal this to the individual in a  
“disclosure of use” statement. You might or might not be required to develop  
a privacy policy, but doing so is a sound practice.  
Streamline the Data Management System  
Collect registration information in such a way that it streamlines your data man-  
agement system. Integrate an online system to feed directly into your database  
system so you do not have to reenter information. Use a relational database that  
allows you to access any piece of information anywhere in your system without  
having to open a different database or create a report on that sort field. Set up your  
system to generate automatic e-mail confirmations. Create reports that help you  
track your progress, including up-to-the-minute reports on session selections to  
adjust your allocation of space or to determine who has or has not registered yet.  
When using online registration, design the system to automatically build  
your database for marketing purposes. Make certain you are able to generate  
reports that give you market segment and demographic data to better under-  
stand and serve your audience. Web-based services such as Cvent \(www.cvent  
.com\), RegOnline \(www.regonline.com\), and others offer user-friendly, flexible,  
and customized online registration services, personalized communication, pay-  
ment processing, room block and agenda management, attendee databases, and  
business intelligence reporting to manage and promote meetings and events of all  
sizes. Please note that any organization or registration system that collects credit  
card payments must be PCI DSS compliant \(payment card industry data security  
standard\) for identity and credit card information protection.  
Use Incentives to Sculpt Behavior  
When you use an online registration system, your database is building itself,  
which saves you money and time. Encourage your attendees to register online by  
offering incentives to do what is most beneficial to you and your organization.  
You might offer discounts, rebates, or gifts. You might structure your registration  
fees for an “early bird” rate if attendees register by a certain deadline \(providing  
you with better cash flow\). You might secure sponsored gifts for the first 100, 300,  
or 500 registrants, such as high-quality tote bags, or hold an on-site drawing from  
the first 100, 300, or 500 for a complimentary registration for the next confer-  
ence. People will always act in their own best interests, so make it worth their  
while to do what you want them to do.  
Welcoming Your Guests  
Whether a paid delegate, ticket holder, or invited guest, everyone coming to your  
event should feel welcomed and treated as a guest. Your registration or check-in Registration  
133  
area should be clean and attractive. Make certain there are sufficient tables or coun-  
ters, adequate signs, the appropriate telecommunications equipment, all collateral  
material to be distributed, sponsor and other promotional material, a credit card  
authorization terminal, petty cash and receipt books, and your registration system  
and equipment \(computers, preprinted badges and packets, badge printers, etc.\).  
When registration begins and attendees are flowing through the lines, the reg-  
istration area can begin to look like a madhouse, with boxes stacked about, papers  
strewn hither and yon, and empty cups piled on tables and counters. It is impor-  
tant to keep this area neat and clean throughout the event so that your efficiency  
is not questioned because of the condition of the workspace. Use pipe and drape  
arrangements or other masking to keep the mess out of sight. Restrict eating and  
drinking to a staff lounge, and when registrars are not on duty, make certain they  
are not visible. \(“Why aren't you helping me instead of sitting there with your soda  
pop!”\) This will also control the proliferation of cups and napkins contributing to  
the mess.to be managed.  
Create User-Friendly Layouts  
It was reported in the November 2001 issue of The Customer Service Advantage  
newsletter that the most important factor affecting customer satisfaction is how  
long customers must wait. Anderson and Zemke \(1991, 74\) note, “Dissatisfaction  
is often the result of uncertainty. Research shows that the most frustrating aspect  
of waiting is not knowing how long the wait will be.” And, as Ralph Waldo  
Emerson said, “We boil at different degrees.”  
We all hate waiting in lines, but we all have to stand in a queue or line at some  
point in our lives, and getting into an event is usually one of those times. The pro-  
fessional event coordinator must control these lines to make sure that the waiting is  
bearable and safe. As shown in Figure 5.3, you will be able to accommodate more  
people in a limited space by creating a “snake” system with rope and stanchion  
guides than by simply allowing people to line up in one long queue or, worse yet, in

Silvers’ Overview of

Types 134 Accommodating the Audience  
no queue at all. The compression mode, in which people at the back push forward  
and compress the space \(and people\) in front, is a recipe for disaster and the cause  
of most crowd injuries—crowd rushes, crushes, and collapses. A long line wind-  
ing down the hall or around the corner is an indication that “this is going to bea  
nightmare” and can become dangerous as the queue blocks other transit functions.  
Take a queue cue from Disney, Universal Studios, and other theme parks. They  
have made waiting in long lines tolerable by installing signs stating just how long  
the wait will be at various points along the queue. Of course, you should antici-  
pate the arrival demand, which will differ according to your entry system and type  
of event, and arrange for sufficient registration or check-in desks and personnel.  
Always have a separate service desk or “courtesy counter” to handle problems or  
special circumstances, which should be off to the side so that resolving a problem  
does not impede the progress of the queue.  
Theme parks have also learned to incorporate the wait into the “show,” making  
it part of the experience. You might adopt and adapt their techniques by employ-  
ing walk-around entertainers, distributing toys and games, and installing inter-  
esting displays, or you might provide or sell refreshments along a queue. \(Why  
do you think retailers put racks of impulse items at the checkout counters?\) You  
might make the queue part of the party. I once had a police officer \(a friend\) actu-  
ally fingerprint conference attendees as they were waiting to sign up for a murder  
mystery party, with each fingerprint page emblazoned with the logo of the event’s  
sponsor. Of course, it wasn't a requirement, but because none of these people had  
ever been fingerprinted before, it was a unique experience and became the talk of  
the conference \(just what the sponsor was hoping for\).  
Payment, Cancellation, and Other Issues  
When designing your registration collateral and system, establish your payment  
and cancellation policies and procedures. Clearly state these policies on your  
materials, including deadlines for special requests \(dietary or accessibility needs\),  
prorated refunds, and other terms and conditions. Then make certain you provide  
the infrastructure to collect fees, disburse refunds, and notify registrants of cancel-  
lations or delays. You might also wish to set up separate welcome desks or reg-  
istration counters for speakers, exhibitors, international delegates, preregistered  
delegates, and on-site registrations that will involve collecting fees. \(Not all your  
registrars need to handle money.\) You must also implement audit procedures to  
ensure accurate gate counts, ticket sales, and cash controls.  
Prepare Your Staff  
The staff must be thoroughly briefed on their duties and responsibilities, rules  
and regulations while on duty, breaks, and break areas \(the staff lounge\), and to Admissions  
135  
whom they report or turn to with questions or service problems. Whether your  
registration staff is composed of volunteers, personnel of a contracted service,  
or your own staff, they must receive training on the equipment and procedures  
of your registration system. They should receive orientation regarding the event,  
the program schedule, and the location of venue features such as toilet facilities,  
meeting rooms, dining rooms, on-site emergency services, and adjacent restau-  
rants or attractions. Even if you have a hospitality desk with concierge personnel,  
the registrars will likely be relied upon to provide this service to attendees.  
Other issues to be covered in training include how to recognize accreditation  
credentials and tickets, follow procedures for complimentary passes, handle mon-  
etary transactions and apply admission rates, and enforce security procedures for  
cash deposits and crowd control. There are two things your staff are never obligated  
to tolerate—profanity and physical abuse. Make certain that security personnel are  
available in the registration area and that there is a two-way method of communica-  
tion \(i.e., radios, telephones\) between staff and security personnel. Establish guide-  
lines as to when it is appropriate to ask for a supervisor or a security guard, and when  
it is appropriate to call the police emergency number directly and immediately.  
Have all the materials that registrars will need prepared and ready, such as  
delegate packets at a conference, or T-shirts, athlete numbers, and safety pins for  
a fun run. Consider the use of uniforms or special clothing items \(e.g., shirts,  
scarves, jackets, vests, or hats\) to clearly identify registration staff, and provide  
name badges to facilitate person-to-person interactions with customers.  
# Admissions  
As the first threshold, admission into an event is an opportunity for the profes-  
sional event coordinator to enhance the event experience. Many event designers  
use this opportunity to intensify the special nature of the event by highlighting  
the difference between the outside environment and the inside setting with an  
exciting entryway or entrance scenario. Admitting an audience member, attendee,  
or guest into the event is also, like registration, a customer service moment of  
truth. The professional event coordinator must anticipate the logistics and opera-  
tional requirements in order to allocate the appropriate resources \(time, money,  
personnel, and space\) to provide the appropriate guest experience.  
Admission Control Strategies  
The admittance system is a control point. Most events have an admission con-  
trol system of some sort, for counting attendance, controlling access, controlling  
costs, or collecting tickets. You might be checking a guest list, checking badges or  
wristbands, tearing tickets, distributing amenities, ink-stamping hands, keeping 136 Accommodating the Audience  
a catering or occupancy count, or preventing the entrance of unauthorized visitors  
or industrial espionage.  
Some events ask invited guests to bring their invitations to show at the door.  
Others sell tickets in advance and/or at the door. Some require preregistration,  
and some require special credentials. Some events are free to the public, with  
ticketed access to special areas or seating. Some events, such as sightseeing tours,  
will not take place unless a minimum number of tickets have been sold. The type  
of event and operational requirements will also suggest certain admittance control  
issues. For example, graduation ceremonies often have limited seating and issue  
graduates a specific number of tickets, but when the entire proud family wishes to  
attend, the ticketed event becomes a first-come, first-seated fiasco. \(If this is your  
problem, you should consider a larger venue, staggering parts of the ceremony, or  
creating a second venue location with closed-circuit coverage of the event.\)  
Arrival and Departure Modes  
Arrival and departure modes will dictate the number of portals and personnel  
required. Guests are in trickle mode when they “trickle” in or out, arriving or  
departing sporadically throughout the duration of the event, such as at a festival,  
exhibition, or open house. When guests “dump” into or out of the event en masse  
or within a brief time period, which is particular to events with specific start and  
end times, they are in dump mode. Even with the trickle mode, there are often  
peak and low traffic times that must be anticipated and planned for. In dealing  
with the dump mode, you must make certain that you have sufficient entrances or  
portals and sufficient personnel to process arrivals in a timely manner. According  
to Anton Shone \(2001, 216\) research done in cinemas shows the average time to  
process a ticket transaction is 20 seconds; multiplied by 1,000 guests, this equals  
about 52 hours. Review the history of the event, comparable event statistics, and  
other forecasting information to determine the probable and predictable mode.  
Ticketing  
Tickets, whether purchased or issued, are used as an admittance control to ensure  
authorized entry and restrict occupancy. You might issue meal vouchers to confer-  
ence delegates to ensure that only paid registrants are admitted to a large luncheon  
or dinner. Tickets could be used to stipulate a specific seat or seating section at a  
spectator event. A food or wine festival could sell tickets to be used at any conces-  
sion so as to eliminate cash handling or accounting problems. Event tickets might  
serve as a proof of payment or as a door prize drawing receipt.  
Ticketing issues are also pricing issues. A ticket price is determined by the  
revenue requirements of the event, the desirability or proximity of the seat assign-  
ment, and the selling costs—taxes, service or handling charges, venue percentage, Admissions

and so on \(see Figure 5.4\). Tickets might be hard tickets \(preprinted, preferably  
by a bonded printer and incorporating a watermark if counterfeiting is a possibil-  
ity\), computer-generated, e-tickets, or tickets on a roll.  
Ticket purchase and distribution will be determined by the type and scope  
of the event, as well as numerous other factors. Advance ticket purchase options  
include in-person purchase at a box office or ticket outlet, purchase by mail, tele-  
phone, fax order, online, or by inclusion in the registration fees. If you have sev-  
eral ticketed events or additional admission permits available for sale, sell them  
all at the same time on one order form or registration form. These can include  
parking permits, special events, tours or companion programs, RV or campsite  
permits, and numerous package options such as group discounts, multiday passes,  
bundled products, and even souvenirs.  
Carefully establish your box office or ticket window sales system when con-  
ducting on-site sales. A formal box office or sales windows might be available at  
the venue, or you might need to bring in or construct them, using either a trailer  
or a secure registration counter arrangement. The box office or ticket counter  
must have a secure area for storing tickets and money, all the equipment necessary  
to collect cash and perform credit card transactions, and a secure area for counting  
and processing transactions. Some event sponsors negotiate and distribute cou-  
pons \(e.g., on-pack, in-pack, and box tops\), which provide a discounted entrance  
or ticket price. The coupon redemption process must be integrated into your  
advance and on-site sales procedures. Ticket distribution methods include mail-  
ing, pickup at a box office or other point of sale \(POS\) outlet, will-call windows at  
the event, an e-mailed confirmation number, or inclusion in a registration packet.  
137  
Figure 5.4  
Ticketing Checklist 138 Accommodating the Audience  
The Gatekeepers  
Volunteers, staff, stewards, or security personnel may handle taking tickets or check-  
ing credentials. They might need to confirm that the guest is entering through the  
correct portal, check to ensure that the attendee is registered for a particular session,  
inspect a ticket to make sure it is authentic, and/or tear a ticket in two and hand  
the stub to the attendee. Other gatekeeping duties might include counting people  
as they pass through—either with a hand counter or ensuring people pass through  
a turnstile, or directing attendees through a magnetometer or security checkpoint.  
These functions should be positioned and staffed appropriately to allow rapid  
accommodation of the volume of admissions expected. As with registration areas,  
these areas should be incorporated into the décor plan to ensure that they are  
attractive, efficient, and effective. You might use colorful Airtubes \(www.airdd.  
com\) to direct guests to the correct portals, install banners or flags, or create bal-  
loon arches in various color schemes. Prepare the guests for the admission pro-  
cedure by installing instructional signs describing what they will be asked to do  
before they reach the entrance. If they will have to show a ticket, identification, or  
pass, ask them to have it out and ready. If they are prohibited from bringing cer-  
tain items into the venue \(e.g., food or beverages\), provide trash receptacles along  
the path. If they are required to pass through a magnetometer, provide trays for  
loose change, keys, and other metal items. If admission to the event is restricted,  
either to ticket holders or credentialed individuals, you should have security per-  
sonnel at each entry portal to assist and/or support the other gatekeepers.  
# Accreditation  
Goldblatt and Nelson \(2001, 4\) define accreditation as “the process required for  
receiving credentials for access to an event or a certain area of an event” and define  
credentials as “evidence of identity and qualification.” Not all events require an  
expansive or complex accreditation system—a ticket is a credential that identifres  
the ticket holder as qualified to enter. The professional event coordinator must  
determine the appropriate level and type of accreditation system to meet the  
security needs of the event, event stakeholders, and event audience. The system  
selected must be integrated into the site plan, the budget, and the operations.  
Appropriate policies and procedures must be established, materials must be pro-  
cured, and training for staff must be provided.  
Access Credentials—Who, Where, and When  
Your accreditation system—establishing and issuing credentials—authorizes  
access to your event and to specific areas at the event site. This means access to Accreditation

the individuals at the event as well, including the guests or attendees, participants,  
and performers, plus the actions or activities taking place at the event. The type and  
scope of your system will be determined by the type and purpose of the event, as  
well as the need to control access to certain areas, people, activities, information,  
equipment, or materials \(see Figure 5.5\).  
Not everyone needs access to everything at all times. Those who set up the event  
do not necessarily need to be there during the event. Those who have received  
special access on a certain day are not necessarily authorized to be there at any  
time during the run of the event. Volunteers who are helping with the registration  
do not automatically get into the VIP lounge or get access to the star performer.  
The media might be welcomed into the stadium, but not necessarily into the  
locker room \(until after the game\). The participants or exhibitors do not neces-  
sarily get onto the event site at any time of the day or night, or get to participate  
in all event activities.  
Zones of Need and Security Issues  
When designing the layout of the event, the professional event coordinator will  
specify the restricted areas that must have controlled access and will determine  
who should have access to those areas based on the need to be there. As you are  
identifying the event elements and their positioning within the event site and  
schedule, confirm the interactions and interdependencies and try to create zones  
of need. These zones of need must be cordoned off in some manner to facilitate  
controlled access, either with fencing, enclosures, separate portals, or other perimeter  
controls. If it cannot be contained, it cannot be controlled.  
139  
Figure 5.5  
Accreditation Checklist 140 Accommodating the Audience  
For example, at a large air show the hospitality tent was restricted to sponsors  
and their guests \(each sponsor received a limited number of ID buttons\). The tent  
had a steward checking buttons at the entrance, but guests were walking out to the  
patio area on the side of the tent and handing their buttons over the fence to their  
friends, who were repeating this scenario. Quite soon, the hospitality tent was  
filled to capacity with unauthorized guests, and the sponsors complained bitterly  
to the show management that this benefit of sponsorship was not as promised.  
Certain credentials might indicate access to specific areas, such as backstage  
but not onstage, and access at specific times, such as backstage only after the per-  
formance. Some venues require that all workers, even a subcontractor’s workers,  
wear identification such as a company name tag or a logo on clothing to prevent  
theft during setup. Confirm your plan with your stakeholders and security advi-  
sors, make any necessary revisions, and then communicate with those who will be  
responsible for implementing the system.  
Credential Distribution  
The process of accreditation includes the method of registration and distribution.  
For large festivals, sports events, and exposition events, you might wish to sched-  
ule one or two days prior to the start of the event for registration and manufacture  
of these credentials. You might conduct this activity by mail or online; however,  
if positive identification is required, this must be done in person. For events using  
lots of volunteers, you might schedule a preevent rally to get everyone excited  
about the job to be done while they are getting their photo IDs processed.  
Your options for establishing credentials can range from quick and cheap to involved  
and costly. As with tickets, you might need to consider a watermark or security seal  
to prevent counterfeiting. You could issue different-colored passes for different days  
or different areas. Staff or volunteer badges could be coded by area or function with  
a bar code that must be swiped through a laser reader to bring up the photo IDs  
on a computer screen. Many events have an “Ask Me” button for staff members and  
certain volunteers to wear to let guests know to whom they can turn for assistance.  
Media Credentials  
Depending on the type, scope, or host of the event, the professional event coordi-  
nator might have to be cognizant of media relations. You might be coordinating  
a small wedding ceremony, in which case media will not likely be an issue. But  
if it is a movie star’s wedding, you might have to arrange a “no-fly zone” over the  
seaside promontory where the ceremony is taking place to prevent paparazzi from  
dangling from helicopters, trying to get a cover photo for the tabloids. However,  
in most cases, the media are welcomed into an event for the purpose of generating  
positive publicity about the event. Seating Plans  
141  
Media credentials are issued based on the type of media \(broadcast, print,  
or electronic\) and the areas or activities the media will be provided access to.  
Sometimes the media are courted like royalty, provided with a media hospitality  
lounge, special media conferences with significant access to celebrities or partici-  
pants, and a fully equipped media center with everything from fax machines to  
Wi-Fi Internet access. At other times, the media are given only limited access,  
such as photographer areas behind rope-and-stanchion barriers at the entrance  
to the event or a specific interview area inside the venue where special guests or  
spokespersons are brought to the reporters. At some events the media are prohib-  
ited from taking any photos or video because the photographic rights have been  
assigned or sold to an exclusive outlet or individual. And at some events the media  
are not permitted access of any type. \(Contrary to what reporters would have you  
believe, the media are not guaranteed access to any- and everything.\)  
Although most public and marketing events are eager to have media cover-  
age, you must be prepared for the media that will, no doubt, descend on the  
event if something bad or controversial happens. Kotler, Bowen, and Makens  
\(1999, 584\) advise that a good crisis management plan will include a predeter-  
mined spokesperson and space where information and updates will be issued, a  
communications mechanism for getting the facts to the spokesperson, and spe-  
cific policies and training for staff to ensure all media inquiries are referred to the  
official spokesperson. Media coverage might result from a crisis or might be antic-  
ipated because of the local, national, or international significance of the event or  
event participants. You may have to locate or designate areas for the microwave or  
satellite trucks needed for the electronic feeds to network broadcasts.  
Seating Plans  
Seating plans are based on the purpose of the event, politics, pricing, protocol,  
and proximity requirements. Sometimes the purpose of an event dictates that  
attendees be able to see and interact with each other or that they all need excel-  
lent sight lines to a main stage. The politics surrounding an event might indicate  
that certain people or groups should not be positioned next to each other, such  
as fans of rival teams at a sports event \(or certain relatives at a social gathering\).  
Pricing issues include ticket prices based on seat location or on investment levels  
by sponsors or donors. Protocol and etiquette issues relate to rank, precedence,  
and tradition and might mandate who sits next to whom. Proximity requirements  
might involve accessibility issues, such as a hearing-impaired person's sightline to  
a sign language interpreter or an award recipient's movement from seat to stage.  
The three types of seating plan most often used for events include assigned seat-  
ing, open seating, and festival seating. 142 Accommodating the Audience  
\* Assigned seating—individuals are assigned a specific seat at a particular  
table \(e.g., banquets\) or within a specific row \(e.g., stadium or theater\); also  
known as reserved seating.  
\* Open seating—individuals may take any seat they wish on a first-come,  
first-served basis; also known as general admission seating.  
\* Festival seating—a large open area in which no actual seats are provided;  
individuals stand where they wish or may bring their own portable seats if  
permitted.  
Creative Seat Identification  
Table numbers, seat numbers, color-coded seating sections, row letters or rib-  
bons, or a combination of these tactics may be used to identify assigned seating.  
Depending on the type of event and the seating plan, the professional event coor-  
dinator may use place cards on the table or place a name card on each seat. Place  
cards may be laid out alphabetically on a reception table, with party favors linked  
to a specific table assignment by color or centerpiece.  
For example, for a baseball-themed bar mitzvah party, the guests’ place cards  
were attached to baseball caps of different teams, and each table centerpiece fea-  
tured a pennant flag of a particular team. For a cartoon-themed bat mitzvah party,  
each place card included a cartoon character to match the centerpiece, which  
featured a large stuffed toy of the character \(the toys were donated to a children’s  
hospital after the event\).  
Seating sections may be identified by color by using chair covers or painted  
chairs, or identified by team, delegation, or department by using flags or banners  
at the ends of the aisles. The rows or pews at a wedding ceremony might be cor-  
doned off along the center aisle with ribbons or floral garlands, or the front pews  
reserved for the family adorned with bouquets. Polaroid photos may be taken of  
incentive guests, scanned, printed on iron-on transfers, and applied to seatback  
covers. One group of attendees had their photos taken upon arrival, and these  
were given to a caricaturist to create drawings in time for them to be made into  
framed place cards for the final dinner.  
Capacity and Capability  
The seating plan of an event is often influenced by the occupancy regulations for a  
specific venue or facility. The seating capacity of a venue is established by the local  
fire and safety codes, depending on the configuration, furnishings, aisle width,  
and obstructions \(see Figure 5.6\). The seating equipment at a venue might be sta-  
tionary and built-in or portable and adaptable, or there might be no equipment  
on-site at all and you will need to rent, build, and/or install it yourself. Many  
purpose-built facilities have fixed and flexible seating options and equipment, but Seating Plans  
143  
Seating— Theater Style U\) Thecenter seat in the first row should be no less than 6 ft \(1.8 m\) from the  
front of the stage, and no chairs should overlap the front of the stage.  
U Typical stacking chairs are 20 in. \(50 cm\) front to back and 17.5 to 18.5 in.  
\(44.5 to 47 cm\) wide.  
Q\) Chairs should be set with at least 3 to 6 in. \(7.6 to 15.3 cm\) between  
contiguous chairs. Note\: Many convention centers and auditoriums require  
and use chairs that interlock for theater-style seating.  
Allot a minimum of 24 in. \(61 cm\) between rows, and if space allows, 32 in.  
\(81 cm\) or more.  
Row spacing for wheelchair access rows needs to be 5 ft \(1.5 m\).  
Aisles—  
Theater  
Style  
There should be aisles on both sides, even if a center aisle is present.  
Aisles should be a minimum of 4 ft \(1.2 m\) wide.  
Increase aisle width by 1 ft \(31 cm\) if more than 400 people.  
Wheelchair-accessible aisles must be 6 ft \(1.8 m\) wide.  
Create a midsection aisle after 15 seats in any direction.  
Cross aisles should be added after 10 to 15 rows, preferably aligned with an  
exit door.  
S OBE eee eye  
If the number of rows in a section exceeds 10 rows, aisles should bea  
minimum of 6 ft \(1.8 m\) wide, and if more than 30 rows, 8 ft \(2.4 m\) wide.  
Classroom  
Setups  
Typical tables are 6 or 8 ft \(1.8 or 2.4 m\) long and 18 or 30 in. \(46 or 76 cm\) wide.  
UU  
Allot a minimum of 2 ft \(0.6 m\) of table space per person and 2.5 to 3 ft \(0.8  
to 0.9 m\) per person if attendees will be using large notebooks or laptop  
computers.  
Allot a minimum of 34 in. \(87 cm\) between table rows for seats and passage.  
CoO  
As wheelchairs require maneuvering space, row space between tables  
in wheelchair-access rows will require 6 ft \(1.8 m\) and the table space  
allotment should be at least 36 to 42 in. \(91 to 107 cm\).  
J Rows should be no more than 24 ft \(7.3 m\) in length and should have aisles  
on both sides.  
Banquet Setups LJ Typical round banquet tables are 60, 66, or 72 in. \(152, 168, or 183 cm\) in  
diameter. The 60 in. \(152 cm\) table seats 8, the 66 in. \(168 cm\) seats 9 or 10,  
and the 72 in. \(183 cm\) seats 10 or 11 people comfortably.  
Wheelchair seating will require 1.5 times as much space per person at the table.  
The space between round tables should be 6 to 7 ft \(1.8 to 2.1 m\) for seats,  
aisle space, and serving functions.  
Other  
When using risers, the backs should have a security rail, and steps with  
handrails should be added for anything over 12 in. \(30 cm\) high.  
Dance floor size—10 sq ft \(0.93 sq m\) per couple.  
Average number of couples dancing = 25% of total attendance.  
Exhibit aisles should be at least 10 ft \(3.05 m\) wide.  
Rear screen projection allowance—16 to 35 ft \(4.9 to 10.7 m\) between wall  
and screen or 1.7 X screen width.  
Ey eee es  
2 X 8 Principle—No one should be seated closer to the screen than 2 X the  
screen height and nor farther than 8 x the screen height.  
Confirm typical setups with venue—unusual configurations and atypical setups may incur  
additional charges and, because they are unfamiliar to setup crews, supervision may be required.

Spatial  
Considerations  
or Event Layouts  
\(All spatial  
requirements must  
be confirmed  
o ensure they  
comply with local  
fire regulations.\) 144 Accommodating the Audience  
not all venues have all types and sizes of equipment \(i.e., chairs and tables\). Some  
facilities such as theaters, arenas, and stadiums have fixed spectator seating; how-  
ever many have flexible seating alternatives such as telescopic grandstands or other  
adjustable seating. For example, the Plenary Hall in the International Convention  
Centre in Durban, South Africa, has raked seating for 1,800, and sophisticated  
technology enables the seats to be raised into the ceiling so that a banquet can be  
set up in the floor space created. Fiber-optic lights on the underside of the seating  
create a starry night sky when in this configuration.  
Helpful Personnel  
Depending on the type and size of the event and its seating plan, assistance person-  
nel are called ushers, stewards, escorts, guides, or greeters, and are used to guide  
guests to a seating section, assigned tables, or specific seats. They might also be  
used to distribute programs and direct traffic flow into \(and out of\) an event. They  
might be used to welcome a delegation arriving at an airport or to put dignitaries  
or athletes in the correct order for a formal entrance. They might be charged with  
checking tickets or credentials, assisting with shuttle bus loading, or simply be there  
to serve as welcoming faces to greet and guide guests as ambassadors of the event.  
Whatever they are called, these personnel should be completely familiar with  
the admissions and seating system \(including the guest list if appropriate\), the  
layout and features of the venue, the purpose of the event and program agenda,  
as well as the policies and procedures regarding guest relations. They should be  
selected based on their social skills and convivial personalities, and provided with  
appropriate training to ensure that they will represent the event organization in a  
positive and productive manner.  
Consider providing a distinctive uniform or clothing item so that these indi-  
viduals are readily identifiable. Many large sports events and entertainment ven-  
ues use a specific colored suit jacket. Other events use logo-imprinted vests, shirts,  
T-shirts, aprons, or entire outfits. When personnel are expected to guide or seat  
guests after the lights have been lowered, they should be provided with small  
flashlights to illuminate the footpath.  
Attendee Services  
Attendee services should be designed to improve the event experience by anticipat-  
ing the likely needs and making services available to meet them. The type of event,  
attendee profile, and overall event environment guides the decision on what services  
should be included. The professional event coordinator also considers the location  
of the event in proximity to the attendee’s home; obviously, for a local event fewer  
services are needed than for an event that requires extensive travel to attend. Attendee Services  
145  
Attendee service begins with the preevent communications and collateral mate-  
rials preparing the guest for the event experience, as well as establishing expecta-  
tions. Local guests might need simple directions. Travelers might need extensive  
instructions regarding anything from travel routes to cultural customs of the host  
country. Delegates to a conference might need business center services for con-  
nections to their offices or tuxedo rental services for the final night gala. Festival-  
goers might welcome stroller rentals, and fair exhibitors might appreciate on-site  
automatic teller machines \(ATMs\) so that buyers can quickly get cash to complete  
their purchases. Party guests might need a coat check service for bulky outerwear.  
Information Stations  
One of the basic services that a professional event coordinator can provide at any  
type of event is someone to talk to for a guest or attendee who has questions.  
That human connection is a central component of quality customer service. An  
information station is appropriate for nearly any type of event; it may be called  
guest services, the information booth, or the welcome table. It may be staffed  
with volunteers, members of a host committee, or hospitality personnel from an  
agency or visitor bureau. An information station should have two-way commu-  
nication capabilities for contact with event security staff and might have courtesy  
telephones for attendees.  
The information station can have local or area information and event site  
directions. It could serve as a message center or the lost and found and “lost  
parents” department. It could serve as the place where inebriated guests come  
to get a safe ride home \(from a prearranged taxi service\), or it might serve as the  
location where groups come to make their connections or to board shuttles. It  
might become an enterprise zone, where publications, souvenirs, office supplies,  
or sponsor-imprinted items are available for sale \(you will need to make certain  
you are set up to collect and pay local sales tax\), or serve as a resource center with  
displays, refreshments, and brochure racks.  
Housing Issues  
As professional event coordinator, you might be responsible for the housing needs  
of an event’s guests, staff, participants, VIPs, and/or entertainers. Depending on  
the type of event, such accommodations include hotels, university dormitories,  
guest houses, or host residences. You might be reserving and paying for rooms,  
negotiating rates for attendees at a headquarters hotel or hotels, or simply iden-  
tifying accommodation options. For tourism events, such as festivals or sports  
events, the identification of adequate rooming options might be sufficient. For  
conference events, specific hotels might be identified, a negotiated room block  
reserved, and a housing bureau secured to handle individual attendee bookings. 146 Accommodating the Audience  
Some life-cycle events require that accommodations be identified and reserved  
for out-of-town family and guests. For incentive travel and corporate events, you  
might arrange for early check-in and late check-out privileges.  
When paying for specific rooms out of the event budget \(e.g., for staff, speakers,  
VIPs, mandated corporate training, or incentive winners\), make certain you  
have clearly specified, both with the room occupant and the hotel, what will  
and will not be charged to your master bill. In-room purchases can range from  
international long distance calls to cleaning out the minibar, even expensive spa  
treatments or luxury items from the hotel gift shops.  
Whether you identify, block, or buy rooms, understand that rates will be nego-  
tiated based on availability and volume, and these negotiations take place during  
your site selection process. Note that delegates who make their own rooming  
arrangements without identifying their affiliation with your event may compro-  
mise tracking the pickup on your room block \(crediting rooms to your contracted  
number of reserved guest rooms\). And when negotiating the rates with a hotel, be  
aware that Internet specials or other discounted rates could jeopardize your room  
pickup if those rates are lower than the conference rates you advertise in your reg-  
istration materials, not to mention the dissatisfaction attendees will express when  
they find someone else has received a lower rate.  
Traveler Aids  
Meetings and conferences, tourism events, destination weddings, and many other  
events welcome out-of-town attendees. It has often been noted that when people  
leave town they get what is sometimes referred to as vacation brain. The ordi-  
nary precautions a person would normally take are forgotten when the individual  
becomes preoccupied with the new and unfamiliar surroundings and expectations  
of the event experience. Consequently, personal items are lost or stolen, people  
lose their sense of direction \(and often their inhibitions\), and attendees find them-  
selves in need of assistance.  
The professional event coordinator can anticipate and alleviate some of the  
resulting distress by locating shopping outlets for lost or left-behind items and  
providing preevent tips on traveler safety, wardrobe suggestions, and maps with  
detailed driving directions. Another idea is to provide a welcome session, an ori-  
entation lecture that reviews the event program and the traveler safety tips and  
highlights the area attractions and amenities.  
Lounges and Concierge Services  
Special lounges may be appropriate for delegates arriving earlier than the allowed  
check-in time at a hotel. Cybercafés allow attendees to collect e-mail, or charging  
stations provided for their mobile devices. Special consideration rooms might Protocol and VIP Services  
147  
be provided for nursing mothers or those who need to conduct daily prayers.  
Smoking lounges might be set aside to accommodate smokers within an other-  
wise smoke-free environment \(which will be far more attractive than cigarette  
butts littering the sidewalk or the area just outside the entrance\).  
For incentive groups, you might arrange a concierge desk exclusively for the  
events guests, special delivery of specific newspapers or magazines, or reserved  
tee times at a golf course. If the incentive guests are receiving numerous souvenir  
items and gifts, a special shipping service might be prearranged so they do not  
have to carry them home in their luggage. If a conference event has a final night  
gala scheduled, it might be possible to have a local beauty salon set up a table  
to take reservations for hairstyling appointments or spa treatments. According to  
Certified Incentive Travel Executive Patrick Delaney, shopping is the number one  
activity preferred at incentive and other destination events, so the event coordi-  
nator might arrange with a signature retail outlet or shopping center to provide  
shuttle service for attendees at appropriate times throughout the event program.  
Protocol! and VIP Services  
Protocol, from the Latin protocollum, meaning “the first \(document\) glued into”  
a book of records \(presumably setting the form for others to follow\), is the code  
of conduct and the forms of ceremony and etiquette observed by diplomats and  
others in a society. In general terms, it means the customs and rules of politeness  
and courtesy between individuals through which we recognize status and avoid  
giving offense \(see Figure 5.7\). For nations and governments, protocol is a system  
of conventions, procedures, and symbols that govern the relationships between  
nation-states and within international organizations. The same is true in regard  
to public or private organizations at formal functions sponsored or held by such  
organizations.

Protocol Checklist 148 Accommodating the Audience  
Role and Scope of Protocol  
Protocol covers such areas as procedures for official visits, symbols \(lags and other  
visual emblems, anthems, and uniforms\), verbal and written forms of address  
and salutations \(known as Tongue and Quill\), order of precedence tables, seating  
arrangements, ceremonial procedures, and guidelines for hospitality. But protocol  
does not apply to official state visits and functions exclusively. Issues of protocol  
can affect the order of speakers at a corporate event, seating at the tables at a wed-  
ding banquet, or which team enters the stadium first at a sports event. Societies,  
whether macro or micro, establish formal and informal rules based on cultural  
tradition, historical custom, social rank, priority, and politics.  
Protocol also includes cultural personal etiquette and social customs such as  
gift giving, gestures, personal space, alcohol use, eye contact, touching, color  
usage, and dress codes. Particularly in today’s global economy, cultural etiquette  
facilitates communication and the conducting of business. However, according  
to Morrison, Conaway, and Borden \(1994, x\), “Communication always takes  
place between individuals, not cultures. Few individuals are perfect representa-  
tions of their culture.” Nevertheless, you should understand these cultural issues  
and incorporate them into the event’s operations.  
The handling and display of flags and other symbols are also sensitive issues.  
Swartz \(1988, 479\) explains\: “Laws have been written to govern the use of the  
flag and to ensure a proper respect for the \[U.S. flag\]. Custom has decreed cer-  
tain other observances in regard to its use.” Flag protocol extends to the world of  
events in numerous contexts and has serious implications; there was an interna-  
tional incident in 1992 when, during a World Series game between the Atlanta  
Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays in Atlanta, the Canadian flag was carried onto  
the field upside down.  
Symbols and emblems might entail similar sensitivities and regulations in the  
corporate world as well. David DeLoach, general manager, entertainment, Magic  
Kingdom, Walt Disney World Resort, notes that Disney carefully controls “cross-  
over branding” when it comes to its characters such as Mickey Mouse. Although  
the Disney characters are regularly present at events held at the Magic Kingdom,  
“Mickey does not hand out company awards at special event functions; it could  
be perceived as a form of corporate endorsement.”  
Tradition, Precedence, and Politics  
Determining order of precedence is the starting point for almost all you do  
regarding protocol at functions where officials of a government or its representa-  
tives are present—from organizing the order of arrival and departure, to seating,  
to introductions of distinguished guests. The need for a system of precedence may  
be explained by the fact that we cannot all walk through a door at the same time. Protocol and VIP Services  
149  
The formal order of precedence based on diplomatic rank is a matter of sheer  
timing. McCaffree and Innis \(1989, 2\) explains, “At the Congress of Vienna in  
1815, the nations laid down the rules of precedence based on diplomatic titles.  
Envoys of equal title were ranked according to the date and hour they presented  
their letters of credentials rather than the size or influence of the nation the envoy  
represented.” This model for order of precedence has been extended to other  
milieus as well. For example, the order of precedence for the states of the United  
States is based on their date of entry into the Union.  
Formal protocol and tradition usually determine what and who takes prece-  
dence, but other factors impact this determination, such as security needs, the  
program agenda, a specific corporate culture, or plain old family politics. From  
state dinners to simple wedding ceremonies, seating plans and entry order ensures  
that the right person is put first, and next to the right person. Sometimes putting  
two individuals together is inappropriate—Aunt Jane and Uncle Bud at a family  
gathering, a feuding mayor and governor at a civic banquet, or heads of state from  
countries in conflict.  
Robert Rogers, CSEP, of Hong Kong-based Events Management and Produc-  
tion Limited \(www.eventsman.com\), has more than 20 years in the event and  
hospitality industry in Asia. He has found that face in Asia, especially China, is  
| ON-SITE INSIGHT  
a concept often overlooked and usually misunderstood by Westerners doing  
business there. “Face is difficult to define but is basically a sociodynamic valu-  
ation similar to reputation or personal brand. To many Asians, face is more  
important than money. To ‘lose face’ can bring dishonor to the family and to  
the person or business, often with dire personal consequences. Not respect-  
ing face in Asia can also bring dire consequences to your events.”  
Rogers describes a major hotel launch in Duanguan \(southern China\) in  
2007 that illustrates what can happen when one is not sensitive to this cul-  
tural custom. “All the local celebrities, government officials, and VIPs were  
invited; however, one government official \(in charge of electricity supply for  
the area\) did not receive an invitation. It was reported he was upset other  
officials had been invited and not him.’ As Rogers recalls, a member of the  
official's staff called the event manager and asked for an invitation. The event  
manager declined because the event was already over capacity. Rogers says,  
“Mysteriously, right in the middle of the event the power supply for the hotel  
was cut, as some ‘testing’ was needed on the local power distributor”  
continues 150 Accommodating the Audience  
Rogers points out that the “subtleties of face are very intricate and difficult  
to quantify. In this case, ‘losing face’ wasn’t because the official wasn’t invited  
in the first place but rather he was outright rejected when he asked. The event  
manager had an opportunity to ‘give face’ by extending an invite. Besides giv-  
ing the official face, the event manager would have gained face as well as  
created valuable guangxi \(connections\).”  
Ceremonies and Ceremonial Procedures  
Ceremonies and ceremonial events are another event context in which protocol,  
customs, procedures, and precedence are often incorporated. Ceremonies may be  
government, celebratory, commemorative, reverent, joyous, or solemn and may  
include religious rites, traditional rituals, formal emblems, and official or sym-  
bolic tasks. They can include investitures or inaugurations, commencements or  
confirmations, groundbreakings or grand openings, and the rites and rituals asso-  
ciated with christenings or naming ceremonies, weddings, or funerals.  
A ceremony within an event should be considered an event unto itself so that  
it will be a memorable and meaningful part of the event experience. Issues of  
precedence order, religious requisites, and traditions must sometimes be observed.  
There might be a level of pomp and pageantry expected, or specific event ele-  
ments mandated. There might be a prescribed agenda, such as the posting of the  
colors \(flags\), Pledge of Allegiance, national anthem, invocation, and the order of  
toasts. Depending on cultural traditions, you might have the beating of drums  
or heraldic horns to officially open an event, or, as is done at important official  
occasions in Jakarta, Indonesia, you might have “Mr. and Mrs. Jakarta” \(a married  
couple selected by the government for their attractiveness, charm, and cultural  
knowledge\) in national costume as the official greeters.  
Sources of information on protocol will vary according to the type of event. You  
might consult government departments or protocol officers, cultural or ceremo-  
nial guidebooks, etiquette books or experts, military protocol manuals, organiza-  
tional policy manuals, corporate representatives, or family members to determine  
the protocol issues and requirements for your particular event. Remember that  
status, rank, and politics exist in virtually any milieu, and failure to consider the  
issues of protocol may have poor results, ranging from disgruntled dinner guests  
to a diplomatic disaster \(not to mention the loss of your credibility as a profes-  
sional event coordinator\). Wrap Up  
151  
Special Services for Special People  
Everyone attending an event is important; some people are very important per-  
sons \(VIPs\) because of their status, rank, fame, fortune, stature, significance to  
the event client or host, or significance to the purpose or success of the event.  
VIPs might include award recipients, celebrities, corporate executives, dignitaries,  
family members, honorees, politicians, or sponsors. They may be attending the event,  
participating in the event, supporting the event, or the very reason for the  
event. VIPs often require special attention and assistance. They must be treated  
with respect and care commensurate with their rank and importance to the event.  
Including and accommodating VIPs can increase the status, stature, and atten-  
dance of an event, but special security issues are often involved, which will have  
costs and special logistics that must be factored into the event’s budget, timeline,  
and site plans. Special routing to, from, and within the event site might be required,  
including particular drop-off and pickup arrangements. Certain celebrities and  
public figures might have to be routed through the backstage or back-of-the-house  
area. Depending on specific security needs, particularly with government digni-  
taries, several routes may be required. The entire event site or certain portions of  
it might have to be thoroughly examined by special security personnel and then  
closed to all until the event starts. Work with the booking agent, protocol repre-  
sentative, or security officials early in the planning process to determine the special  
amenities and arrangements necessary to facilitate attendance, as well as the level  
of products or services that befits the VIP’s position or status.  
Wrap Up  
Accommodating an audience is primarily focused on marketing and customer  
service. The marketing and collateral materials prepared and distributed must be  
designed to create interest, establish expectations, and provide all the necessary  
information for participation or attendance. Although the printed piece may still  
be customary, new communications technology offers innovative and exciting  
promotional and environmentally conscious opportunities.  
Admission controls allow the professional event coordinator to regulate atten-  
dance for marketing, financial, and security reasons. An efficient and effective regis-  
tration and credentialing system will automatically build databases while serving the  
needs of the guest and the hosting organization. The arrival of the audience must  
be anticipated and arranged to ensure a safe and smooth entrance into the event.  
Seating plans are designed to facilitate the appropriate visibility and attendee  
interactivity specified by the purpose, goals, and objectives of the event. Numerous  
creative and expressive strategies may be used to direct guests and attendees to 152 Accommodating the Audience  
their assigned seats. Providing the appropriate services for attendees and VIPs  
ensures a memorable and meaningful event experience. Attention to protocol  
issues facilitates the appropriate recognition of rank, tradition, and ceremonial  
customs associated with many events.

EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Outline and describe the collateral materials, admissions control systems, seating  
plans, attendee services, and protocol requirements you would implement for each  
of the following events.  
A. The national soccer championships are to be held in your city and will include  
four competitions on four different days. You are hoping to attract 20,000  
spectators for each game, and you expect that each game will be sold out.  
You also anticipate significant media coverage and probably some unruly  
fans.  
Your local college is holding an alumni reunion in conjunction with the com-  
mencement ceremonies for the upcoming graduating class. The alumni  
reunion is designed to kick off a major fundraising drive for a new student  
union building, and it will be important to attract generous contributions at  
the reunion. A famous movie star, a former student of the college, has agreed  
to deliver the commencement address.  
Your city has been selected as the site for an international summit conference  
on promoting peace through event tourism. Delegations from 40 different  
nations will be invited, including high government officials and numerous  
diplomatic envoys. The six-day conference will include daily plenary sessions, Wrap Up 153  
breakout meetings, and poster sessions, culminating in the delivery of a  
position paper to be circulated to heads of state throughout the world. There  
will be delegate luncheons each day, but the attendees will be on their own  
in the evenings. Because of the inclusion of numerous countries with contro-  
versial government policies, you are expecting significant media coverage,  
and the conference may attract demonstrators wishing to gain publicity.

—Anonymous  
Ive been on stage in one way or another most of my life, as costume designer, stage  
manager, performer, salesperson, chairperson, board member, manager, speaker,  
teacher, and event designer. Some have said that I have sought the spotlight, but  
as anyone who has been in the spotlight will tell you, it’s the work behind the  
scenes that gets you there.  
Setting the stage for an event is something that those attending it rarely get  
to see; they only see the results. They don’t think about all the work behind the  
scenes necessary to provide the backdrop for the experience they will have. We  
have to think about every aspect of that experience and devise ways to ensure they  
will be able to understand, enjoy, and participate in it while they are at the event.  
Just like a theatrical production, the design choices we make about the setting are  
influenced by the impressions we intend to make. Some choices are purely practical,  
while others are symbolic. They all, however, have reasons and results.  
The next two chapters explore the options available for creating the desired  
atmosphere in which the event experience will take place, including the opera-  
tional needs and ramifications associated with those choices, so that the spotlight  
will be able to shine on stage.

# Coordinating  
the Environment  
In the most successful spaces, you don’t see  
everything at once.  
—Vicente Wolf, American interior designer  
In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
e Create environments that are legible for the user and suitable for the  
purpose of the event. ,  
e Develop themes that support the event objectives and communicate  
the desired message.  
e Coordinate a multisensory environment, incorporating the theme  
with the use of décor items and illusions.  
e Identify the staging and equipment needs to facilitate the functional  
requirements of the event environment.  
e Incorporate visual communication tools to guide guests and enhance  
event objectives.  
157 Roe and visitors bureau \(CVB\) had been awarded an excellence-in-service  
gold medal by a national magazine, and the local hospitality community decided  
to hold a luncheon to congratulate the CVB's staff. Although the staff knew they were  
attending a free luncheon sponsored by the convention center, they did not know that  
= oneotine local suppliers was decorating the room. The decorator hung 18-inch-diameter  
gold medals made of painted Styrofoam, suspended from red, white, and blue lengths of  
draping vinyl, over individual tables to resemble lanyard-style award medals. These inex-  
\_ pensive floating centerpieces filled the room with celebratory splashes of color from the  
\: tabletops up to the high ceiling. AS the CVB staff arrived, they were astounded to find  
these colorful decorations when they had expected just another plain luncheon function  
in the unadorned convention center. A staff member approached the decorator, and with  
23 slight mist in her eye, exclaimed in awe, “You did this for us?”

Even the simplest of decorations is an expression of care and appreciation. It  
creates an environment or atmosphere of celebration, motivation, commemoration,  
education, or congratulation. It is up to the professional event coordinator to  
work with the appropriate designers and suppliers to create an environment with  
a purpose, the desired message, and a legacy of memories. Using good taste, creativ-  
ity, and ingenuity, the professional event coordinator must create an environment  
that facilitates the function, goals, and objectives of the event.  
Frank M. Whiting \(1954, 210\) stated, “A background or environment of some  
kind is inevitable. Is the environment appropriate or inappropriate, effective or inef-  
fective, an asset or a source of distraction?” At any event, there is always some sort of  
inherent environment or atmosphere. It might be warm or cool, wet or dry, crowded  
or spacious, stimulating or relaxing, comfortable or unpleasant. There are lights,  
colors, sights, sounds, and smells. You must consider the inherent background or  
environment and procure the proper staging, décor, and equipment to create an  
appropriate and effective environment that becomes an asset to the event experience.  
Event Legibility  
The event environment is a form of nonverbal communication, communicating  
on many conscious and subconscious levels. The professional event coordinator Event Legibility

Legibility Factors  
\(Adapted from Society  
of Fire Protection  
Engineers, 2002\)  
can use the science behind this to create spaces that improve, influence, and con-  
trol the use of those spaces. This begins with legibility, a precept that should be  
infused throughout all aspects of an event's design and environment. Event leg-  
ibility concentrates on the cues that allow a user \(an event attendee\) to recognize,  
better understand, navigate, and relate to the environment and the experience  
\(see Figure 6.1\). It encompasses architectural, graphic, audible, tactile, and written  
communication, as well as environmental and cognitive psychology, sociology,  
retail anthropology, semiotics, cartography, dramaturgy, and other human behavioral  
sciences. It can also include, according to Dr. G. Keith Still, founder of Crowd  
Dynamics Ltd., the art of direction and misdirection used by magicians.  
Legibility cues must be apparent, coherent, and consistent for proper inter-  
pretation and decision making, which depends on the physical, sociological, and  
cultural characteristics of individuals in the environment. These characteristics  
include who they are, whom they are with, what they choose to do and why, and  
where they choose to go and why. Cognition and interpretation is also influenced  
by the implicit and explicit semiotic communications \(verbal and nonverbal signs  
and symbols\) about the event and within the event \(Getz 2007\), which vary by  
culture and individual memory, emotion, opinions, familiarity, and other subjec-  
tive factors \(Berridge 2007\). The following spatial and behavioral cognition fac-  
tors enhance the effectiveness of the design principles, tactics, and elements used  
to create an event environment, to ensure the focus remains on the fundamental  
purpose and expected outcomes of the event.  
Spatial Cognition  
Spatial cognition is what we humans use to identify, organize, and navigate our  
environment. It facilitates decision making about and decision execution within  
our environment, and what we want, can, and will do in that environment.  
The principles of wayfinding, first developed by architect Kevin Lynch in 1960  
\(Gifford 2002\), form many of the tenets of environmental psychology including  
paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks. 160 Coordinating the Environment  
Paths—Paths are the routes and pathways used to get in and out, and from  
here to there \(where “I want to go”\) in an event environment. Typical exam-  
ples include aisles at trade shows and to seating sections at sports arenas,  
traffic cones lining the route in a parking area, or brightly colored inflated  
tubes that progressively change colors as one approaches different activities  
at a festival. Their layout facilitates the flow of people through the chore-  
ography of the event \(discussed further in Chapter 8\). Their configuration  
and condition also affect the safety of the crowd flow during an emergency  
because, as Fruin \(1993\) points out, “line of sight” equals “line of flight.”  
Edges—Edges include the spatial, temporal, and conceptual boundaries  
used to define where one is allowed to go and not go and when. Typical  
examples include fencing, draping, or other barriers to block access to restricted  
or hazardous areas; using music or lowering lights to signal the start of a  
program; and raising the lights to signal the end of a party. Boundaries also  
include what is permitted and what is prohibited, which can be communi-  
cated using signs, verbal announcements, and the positioning of enforcement  
personnel and/or equipment. Establish obvious boundaries to ensure safety  
and encourage desired behavior.  
Districts—Districts are the regions or zones that imply a threshold and a  
distinctive purpose or activity. Typical examples include entryways, dance  
floors, lounge areas, breakout rooms, beer tents, or seating areas. Regions  
should have differing visual character and might be established by theme,  
function, or entertainment, such as a “heaven and hell” theme décor, food  
courts at expositions, conversation \(quiet\) zones at networking receptions,  
ora country and western stage and a salsa stage at a southwestern celebration.  
Nodes—Nodes are the well-known intersections and junctures where a  
directional or preferential choice is made regarding the options available,  
which requires sufficient information to make that choice. Typical examples  
include centralized information booths at arts and crafts fairs, event direc-  
tories in hotel lobbies, kiosks in convention center foyers, and other service  
points. Many events use these intersections as waiting areas, group meet-up  
places, or networking lounges for event goers. Signs that confirm locations  
and options should be located at all decision points.  
Landmarks—Landmarks are the visible attractions or iconic elements that  
serve as the spatial anchors and orientation cues regarding the overall layout  
of an event space. Typical examples include entertainment stages at festivals,  
elaborate buffet stations at parties, or registration counters at conferences.  
Landmarks should be visual magnets and can be achieved with themes,  
activities, props, inflatable sculptures, or different colored balloon arches.  
Given the emphasis on and nature of “in-the-hallway” attendee interaction  
for meetings and conferences \(Vanneste 2008; McAllen 2009\), as well as  
the social nature of gatherings of any kind, the professional event organizer Event Legibility  
161  
should consider providing a centralized plaza or “village square” as both a  
landmark and node where people can gather in a refreshing and multifaceted  
setting.  
Behavioral Cognition  
The behavioral sciences also tell us how an individual receives and interprets cues  
used to identify, organize, and navigate an experience. People need to have a pur-  
pose, permission, information, motivation, and sufficient room and time in order  
to properly navigate an event's experiential dimensions. Dramaturgy, the art of  
dramatic composition and representation, provides the principles used in creating  
an environment that facilitates the desired and required behavior. These include  
structure, direction, time, space, and action.  
Structure—Structure relates to the underlying narrative of the event’s  
episodic or linear progression, which is directly related to the event’s pur-  
pose and objectives. Attendees need to have the principal path and options  
clearly identified to facilitate effective decision making that achieves  
their and the event’s expectations. Typical examples include differenti-  
ated education tracks at conferences, dinner/dance galas, and competitions  
within a beauty pageant.  
Direction—Direction relates to identifying the procedures and providing  
the sensory cues that tell the attendee what to do to get what they want,  
where to go and when, and how to find what they need. Typical examples of  
these include on-item bidding instructions for silent auctions, entertainment  
schedules at festivals, color-coded parking lots, and segregating registration  
counters alphabetically.  
Time—Time relates to providing enough time to get where one wants  
or needs to go, scheduling activities for a predetermined or self-directed  
agenda, and using décor for navigating a spatial timeline. These include  
such things as ensuring conference attendees have enough time to use the  
toilet facilities and get to the next session, pregame and half-time shows at a  
sports event, and “dancing through the decades” theme décor.  
Space—Space relates to the use of space and the atmosphere created within  
it. The experience must be designed for the space in which it will occur,  
which will determine the positioning of services and service points, and  
will be affected by density preferences and restrictions. Typical examples  
include theme transitions for buffet stations, space allocation for various  
participatory activities, ticket booths for food festivals, and crowded versus  
spacious dance floors according to the type of dancing expected.  
Action—Action relates to the movement through the event experience and  
within its environment. This includes arrival, departure, and intra-event  
movement capacity and capability, and involves programming, logistical, and 162 Coordinating the Environment  
safety considerations. Typical examples include using a marching band to  
move party guests from cocktails in a prefunction area into the main dining  
room, using metered access to buffets by table number at a wedding dinner,  
and staggered scheduling for entertainment stages at a festival.  
Learning Environments  
We are all lifelong learners; each and every one of us is always learning \(delib-  
erately or unintentionally\). We learn things because we want or need to in order to  
fulfill some personal, professional, political, pleasurable, or social objective. From  
“traditional” learning environments such as educational conferences and corporate  
training programs to “enrichment” or “economic” learning environments such as  
cultural festivals and consumer gate shows or retail events, the professional event  
coordinator has an opportunity and a responsibility to create an environment that  
facilitates learning in an atmosphere that meets the purpose and objectives of the  
event experience.  
We attend conventions and conferences to enhance our professional devel-  
opment and connections so we may advance in our careers—we learn more so  
we can earn more. We attend exhibitions and expositions so we can find out  
what’s new, better, cheaper, and unusual. As tourists, we travel to different places  
to literally and figuratively expand our horizons. We have and attend personal  
celebrations to connect with others and build our social network and support  
systems, which requires learning about those within that network and sharing  
our experiences. We attend meetings and training programs to find solutions  
and achieve proficiency. We attend religious and charity functions to review and  
renew our beliefs and values. We attend leisure, entertainment, and sport events  
to be enthralled, enthused, and amused, meanwhile absorbing information and  
attitudes. We are all constantly in search of facts, concepts, skills, values, ideas,  
and ideals.  
Adult Learning Dynamics  
How we learn is a complex and extensive field of study that cannot be fully  
addressed here, but for those professional event coordinators charged with pro-  
ducing educational and training events specifically, further study into adult learn-  
ing models will provide a solid foundation of principles for learning environment  
design and content development. “Most all the learning theories on adult learn-  
ing are grounded in behavioral and social psychology, including the work of John  
Sweller \(cognitive load\), Albert Bandura \(social learning\), and David A. Kolb  
\(experiential learning\)” \(Hogg 2010\). Other adult learning theorists include  
Malcolm Knowles \(andragogy\), Carl Rogers \(student-centered learning\), Marcia Learning Environments  
163  
Conner \(learning styles\), and Jack Mezirow \(transformative learning\) \(Ramsborg  
and Tinnish 2008\).  
When designing the program content, presentation style, and learning envi-  
ronment, the professional event coordinator must understand and respect the  
needs of the adult learner. First and foremost is the fact that adult learners  
are adults. They make their own choices for their own reasons. They have a  
lifetime’s worth of experience they bring to the event, as well as a life outside  
the event \(pressures, distractions, etc.\) that affects the learning environment.  
In addition, as Masterman and Wood \(2006\) point out, attendees are contrib-  
uting to the event product as well as to each other’s experience at the event.  
Multimodal, multimedia, and multisensory settings should be established that  
encourage discussion, discovery, questioning, and exchanging ideas, while  
providing the tools and technologies that meet the needs of visual, auditory,  
tactile-kinesthetic, and tech-savvy learners.  
Enhancing the Learning Process  
Numerous factors affect the individual in the learning environment and must be  
addressed in the program design and setting \(Connell 2002; Knowles, Holton,  
and Swanson 2005\).  
\* Physiological—attention spans, reaction time, reflection  
® Psychological—safety, removal of personal and environmental distractions  
\* Emotional—socialization, validation, control, mutual trust, and respect  
© Social/cultural—interaction, acceptance, democratic atmosphere  
¢ Physical—space, temperature, odors, light, etc.  
\* Technological—visual and auditory enhancement  
The learning environment should include adequate space, appropriate \(ergo-  
nomic\) furnishings, freedom of movement, and interactive layouts. Distractions  
such as exterior movement, noise, or outside communication links must be mini-  
mized. Multisensory stimulation increases comprehension \(Wright 1988\) and  
music in particular is known to stimulate creativity, focus, and other advanta-  
geous learning behaviors \(Sonder 2004\).  
Interaction with the other participants is particularly important in an adult  
learning situation. Presenters are becoming facilitators rather than educators,  
participants are becoming more active in providing content, and learning extends  
beyond the confines of the classroom and class time period. Settings should be  
designed to accommodate this through collaboration-enhancing layouts \(Vanneste  
2008\) and seating configurations that promote interpersonal contact. Radde \(2009\)  
emphasizes the necessity for comfortable peer-to-peer and participant-to-presenter  
sight lines in seating configurations, especially with regard to the fatigue and pain  
caused by straight row seating, which can cause one to turn ones head or upper 164 Coordinating the Environment  
body anywhere from 15 to 85 degrees producing pressure and irritation on the neck  
and lower back. The décor for a learning environment should reinforce the  
learning objectives, create a positive atmosphere, and accommodate the learner’s  
physical and communal needs.  
Theme Development  
Themes are very popular devices for a broad variety of events, from fundraisers to  
festivals, and marketing events to meetings. The American College Dictionary defines  
a theme as a subject or topic. Theatrical scholars associate theme with the principle  
message of a play. John K. Mackenzie \(2000\) asserts that a theme is a “psycho-  
syntactic” device for compressing a big idea. A theme allows us to quickly commu-  
nicate a broad range of ideas and images based on widely held cultural assumptions  
and associations. Joe LoCicero \(2008, 161\) says that “a theme gives form to your  
stated goals” and “should resonate with your intended audience and present a  
unifying component for attendees.”  
Pine and Gilmore \(1999, 213, 52\) trace the word “theme” to the Greek thema,  
denoting “the place” or “something placed.” They contend that “experiences  
occur in places, and the best of those places are themed.” They propose that there  
are five principles for developing a theme\:  
1. It must alter a guest’s sense of reality.  
2. It must affect the experience of space, time, and matter.  
3. It must integrate space, time, and matter into a cohesive realistic whole.  
4. It is strengthened by creating multiple places within a place.  
5. It must fit the character of the enterprise staging the experience.  
They also assert, “The theme must drive all the design elements and staged  
events of the experience toward a unified storyline that wholly captivates the  
customer.”  
A theme establishes expectations by putting the experience in a recognizable  
context. A theme builds excitement, creates anticipation, and promotes involve-  
ment in the experience to come. Themes are used to reinforce a message, market-  
ing goals, and/or desired behavior. Mackenzie \(2000\) asserts, however, “A theme,  
by itself, doesn’t mean much. It gains value in three ways\: 1. The experiences  
audience members invest to interpret it. 2. How convincingly you develop it. 3.  
How well it amplifies your core concepts.”  
Creativity—Inspiration to Idea  
There are libraries filled with books on creativity—how it works, how it is cul-  
tivated, how to be creative, and so on ad infinitum. The poet Robert Frost said, Theme Development  
165  
“An idea is a feat of association.” In an article profiling five creativity gurus,  
Jenny Sullivan \(2001, 17\) states, “What we produce depends on what we ingest.”  
Marian L. Davis \(1980, 11\) advises, “To increase one’s originality and creativity,  
one should seek new ways of using old, familiar media and items plus practice  
‘cross-sensory interpretation . . . sensitizing oneself to a wide range of experiences  
and translating them into other forms of expression.” | am a strong proponent of  
adopt and adapt—taking an existing idea or image and reinterpreting it to meet the  
particular needs and conditions of an event.  
The sources of and methods for sparking inspiration are as varied as individuals,  
but most rely on a broad variety of stimuli and the ability to translate such stimuli  
into new manifestations. Ideas can come from television, movies, theater, music,  
magazines, books, conversations, shopping, photographs, locations, politics, fashion,  
religious, or cultural rituals, other industries, and surfing the Internet. Some people  
use brainstorming techniques, some use mind mapping, and others conduct in-depth  
research into a topic. All these methods rely on a well-stocked inventory of experi-  
ences, references, and information.  
Theme development, like event coordination, starts with the purpose of the  
event and the client’s expectations of the outcome. Deborah Borsum, CSEP,  
CERP, CMD of The Meetinghouse Companies, Inc., in Elmhurst, Illinois,  
emphatically believes that this begins with listening—listening to the client talk  
about why he or she is having the event and what the client wants to happen as  
a result of the event. Defining the end product and customer profile establishes  
the criteria to be met by the selection and development of the theme. The type of  
function, the date and time, or the location of the event could be the inspiration  
that guides the creative process. All of these will certainly shape the final design.  
Work from the Familiar  
Many event designers advise that a theme should be based on something familiar  
to the audience, then expanded and interpreted in an unusual way. A joke is no  
good if you have to explain it, and a theme is not effective if you have to explain  
it. You want the audience to quickly understand the overall concept or circum-  
stances so they are able to anticipate and participate in the experience. A theme  
based on a familiar topic, locale, or phrase provides clarity and connection.  
Selection of a familiar theme depends, however, on the designer’s understand-  
ing of what is familiar to each particular audience. A Wild West Rodeo theme  
will likely be familiar in the United States but might not be relative or familiar  
in South Africa. A theme also depends on the context. “Go for the Gold” might  
communicate achievement in the context of the Olympic Games, a historical  
reference to the nineteenth-century gold rush in the United States, or a hunt  
for buried pirate treasure. “Carnival” might conjure up images of clowns, cotton  
candy, and merry-go-rounds; it might evoke images of the bright, raucous parades 166 Coordinating the Environment  
in Rio de Janeiro; or it might bring to mind the elegant masks and costumes of  
Venice. The event designer must understand the audience's geographic culture,  
corporate culture, ethnic culture, and popular culture in order to find images and/  
or concepts that will be familiar.  
Use Cultural Icons  
Using cultural icons, those images that are deeply ingrained or widely understood,  
communicate a theme quickly and effectively \(see Figure 6.2\). They provide a  
base from which the designer can expand and develop a theme environment.  
Cultural icons differ according to the geographic, socioeconomic, and educa-  
tional backgrounds of the audience.  
Movies are the singlemost commonly shared experience in modern culture  
and, in the United States particularly, television is probably second. Other entertain-  
ment domains such as theater, music, and sports vary according to current popu-  
larity within a demographic or ethnographic group. Historical icons might be  
real \(e.g., from the eighteenth century\) or imagined \(e.g., futuristic or based on  
fantasy\). Nostalgia is applicable to within one or two generations only \(other-  
wise it becomes “history”\), and very popular when segmented into an overview  
of a specific decade \(e.g., the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s\). Personal experiences  
include common or shared events or leisure pursuits. Politics and current events  
are, indeed, current, and can be powerful because of their immediate relevance.  
Indigenous icons could relate to a specific ethnic culture, corporate culture, or  
demographic. “The Big Five” could indicate the five animal species one would hope

a location, such as the Sydney Opera House or Ayers Rock for Australia, the Eiffel  
Tower for Paris, or saguaro cactus for the U.S. Southwest.  
Various personal and public occasions differ, depending on the culture. Holidays  
vary from place to place, both in existence and importance. Festivals may be associ-  
ated with a particular culture or location \(the cornerstones of many tourism market-  
ing plans\), and seasons have different characteristics throughout the world \(winter  
is not the same in a tropical zone as it is in an alpine zone\). Conceptual icons  
might be virtually universal, such as the psychological concepts of happiness or  
achievement, or they might be culturally based and philosophical, such as heaven  
and hell, Americana, or “family values.” Sometimes event designers are given a  
word, phrase, or slogan to interpret, such as “We Are the World” or “Shine.”  
Many event designers pay close attention to current fashion when crafting a  
theme environment, incorporating the latest colors, images, and attitudes from  
clothing styles, interior design trends, and technological advances. Themes can also  
be gleaned from historical fine art contexts such as impressionism, cubism, or sur-  
realism; fine art or fashion itself \(e.g., “A Work of Art” or “Haute Couture”\); or a  
single color such as red or blue.  
Incorporate the Five Senses  
A theme should incorporate all five senses throughout the event design, including  
sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. The more senses affected by the environ-  
ment, the more memorable the event will be. The sensory attributes of an event  
are forms of nonverbal communication and have the ability to touch both our  
conscious and subconscious minds and emotions. Sights and sounds are cerebral—  
processed in our minds, whereas taste, touch, and smell are physical—processed  
in our bodies. Many believe that smell is the most powerful of the senses and able  
to conjure up intense reactions based on memories of life experiences. The event  
designer can enhance positive sensory cues and qualities and should make every  
attempt to eliminate negative ones. The sensory cues in an event environment  
include the following\:  
° Sight—setting, props, floral arrangements, color, fabrics, food presentation,  
lighting, attire ;  
\* Sound—ambient noise \(good or bad\), soundscaping, musical entertain-  
ment, dialogue, dining sounds \(i.e., glasses clinking, crunchy foods, etc.\)  
° Taste—food, beverage, atmospheric and olfactory aftertaste  
® Touch—surfaces, fabrics, furnishings, food texture, visual textures \(that  
stimulate a tactile sensation\)  
° Smell—food aromas, flowers, fuels \(cooking and power generation\), scented  
candles/incense/oils, ambient aromas \(natural scents and malodorous smells\)

# INSIGHT  
Event Designer Steve Brown, PhD, of Visible Management in Adelaide,  
Australia, uses smell as a way to facilitate people movement. He points out  
that inevitably there is a bottleneck between the registration desks of a  
major conference and the entry to the main room. No amount of cajoling  
from conference staff will get delegates inside quickly. The event designer  
might be able to solve this creatively using performers working the crowd  
and gently leading them inside, but another way is with what he calls cof-  
fee crowd control.  
Assuming registration is in the morning, coffee is probably high on the  
list of audience needs right at this time, but often the only coffee available  
is “conference coffee \(that is, not great coffee\).” He places a table at either  
side of the entrance, out of sight of the audience, just inside the doors of  
the main room. On the tables he has “real coffee brewing in percolators,  
generating that wonderful fresh, strong coffee smell.” This scent is then  
wafted out of the room and over the first few rows of delegates at the reg-  
istration area by gentle fans.  
The delegates turn as a subconscious response to the smell, see the Coffee  
Bar sign he has placed at the other \(far\) side of the hall, and they make a  
beeline for it. “Many will even be convinced that the coffee that they obtain  
there \(conference coffee\) tastes as good as the smell \(of real coffee\) by the  
entrance.’ The audience has not been denied the experience they desire \(i.e.,  
chatting, exploring satchels, and having a coffee\), the logistic issue has been  
dealt with \(i.e., clearing the entrance and getting the delegates inside more  
quickly\), and there has been no intrusion or interruption for the audience  
member. “Problem solved.”  
Package the Experience  
A great title can communicate the vision of the event, but the name alone cannot  
express the theme without the support and reinforcement of multiple dimensions.  
With the theme clearly defined and the image distilled to its essence, the event  
designer uses that foundation for reinforcing the theme throughout thé dimensions  
of the experience—anticipation, arrival, atmosphere, activity, appetite, and ameni-  
ties. All of the elements are tied into the theme, inception to completion, to package  
an integrated experience that supports the event objectives and communicates the  
desired message. The Layers of Décor  
169  
Relating to the Pine and Gilmore principle that a theme must alter reality, all  
these themed elements and details should put the guests “somewhere” they could  
not go themselves. The environment and experience should literally be out of  
the ordinary. There is, however, a caveat—the presentation must be theater. The  
audience must be able to discern staged events from actual events. For example,  
a shoot-out by cowboys in costume during a Wild West theme party, or between  
men in spacesuits with laser tag guns during a Outer Space theme party, is easily  
recognizable as an entertainment activity, but a mock shoot-out between “gang  
members” or “terrorists” during an avant-garde or “urban extreme” theme party  
might not be recognizable as theater.  
The Layers of Décor  
Décor is a primary means of establishing a theme environment or enhancing  
the desired atmosphere. It can transform a venue into a new vista, direct pedes-  
trian traffic flow, facilitate learning or interaction, express powerful emotions, and  
communicate important messages. Like theatrical stage design, event décor is an  
art form that literally “sets the stage” for the event experience. It can be as simple  
as highlighting the inherent setting or as complex as creating an alternate reality  
within a specific space.  
Janet Landey, CSEP, of Party Design in Johannesburg, South Africa, contends  
that an event environment “should have layer upon layer upon layer of imag-  
ery and details.” Interior designers approach the decoration of a living space or  
workspace with a multilevel or multilayered methodology. These layers begin  
with the inherent architecture and architectural features, followed by paint colors  
for the walls and ceiling, then the floor coverings. These are the largest design  
areas and those least likely to change over a period of time. They then select fur-  
niture, drapery and upholstery fabrics, accessories and accent fabrics, plants, and  
lighting fixtures—those items that might be changed more frequently depending  
on the mood or taste of the current occupant. The event designer might find  
this approach useful.  
# Background  
The background is the “inevitable environment.” It includes the walls, ceiling, floor,  
andarchitectural features of the venue. Remember, there isa background even if there  
are no walls, ceiling, or floor \(the great outdoors\), or these elements are temporary  
\(a tent\). Sometimes the designer approaches the basic environment as a “blank can-  
vas” onto which color, lines, shapes, and textures may be added; in other cases, the  
setting already serves the needs of the overall design. For example, photographs or  
illustrations can be reproduced via digital printing on backdrops, scrims, banners, 170 Coordinating the Environment  
signs, and wall coverings with practically no dimensional restrictions. You can also  
create a digital vista by projecting a series of scenic images or picture segments on a  
series of projection screens, which can span the length of a ballroom or surround  
an audience. The professional event coordinator must work closely with the  
designer to make certain that the appropriate installation time and equipment  
will be available and that all décor is safely installed and securely rigged.  
° Walls—W/alls and perimeters can be concealed or enhanced with digital murals,  
draping, facades, fiber-optic or Mylar curtains, foliage, painted scenic back-  
drops, panels, scenery, spandex shapes, and/or video landscapes. There are  
even mural backdrops that change scene when lit with ultraviolet light.  
\* Ceilings—Ceilings \(and the space from the top of the head up to the ceiling\)  
can be decorated with air-filled tubes, balloons, banners, chandeliers \(functional  
or faux\), fabric draping, dripping or draping twinkle lights, flags, floating  
latticework panels or picture frames, hanging gardens, suspended props,  
and/or lighting projections.  
¢ Floors—Floors can be redecorated with custom carpets in the color of  
your choice \(even decorated with an inlaid logo or event title\), paint, sheet  
linoleum, or dance floors, which may be oak or teak wood parquet,  
black and white parquet, assorted marble colors, custom painted, or  
covered in special plastic coverings \(which may also be customized with  
logos or images\).  
\* Architectural features—Windows can be draped or masked with fabric or  
foliage. Structural columns \(and tent poles\) can be draped with fabrics,  
surrounded with foliage or faux fixtures, washed with dramatic lighting,  
wrapped with spiraling balloons, or dressed with fabrics or sculpted fiber-  
glass to resemble a forest of giant trees with branches dripping in moss and  
flowers to create an enchanted forest.  
Color  
Color is probably the most evocative element of décor available to the designer.  
Color is a primary component of design in everything from themes to promo-  
tional collateral materials. It can create strong emotions and induce physical reac-  
tions. It will be included within every layer of the décor, from the walls to the  
furnishings, from the floors to the flowers. Color is always present—even clear  
plastic draping, bubble wrap coverings, glass bricks, and Plexiglas lecterns reveal  
or reflect the surrounding colors and lights.  
\* Palettes—A palette or color scheme is a harmonious grouping of colors. It  
may consist of primary colors, complementary colors, analogous colors,  
monochromatic colors, earth tones, jewel tones, bold and bright, subdued  
and pale, or any number of color combinations. The Layers of Décor  
Visibility—The human eye can detect approximately 250,000 different colors;  
however, it focuses better on those on the red end of the spectrum—warm colors—  
and is less able to focus on the cool colors at the blue end \(Monroe 2006\).  
Connotations—Although market researchers study people's emotional  
responses to color, no color has an intrinsic meaning. Responses to color  
seem to be fairly universal within Western societies, but other cultures  
endow specific colors with completely different symbolic meanings.

John J. Daly Jr, CSEP, of John Daly, Inc., International, based in Santa Barbara,  
California, recounts a story about decorating a hotel ballroom in Korea for  
an event celebrating the tenth anniversary of a hotel, which Buddhist monks  
were coming to bless. Knowing that this was a very joyous occasion, Daly had  
decorated the entire ballroom in yellow and white flowers and fabrics, believ-  
ing that this was just the “happy” look appropriate for the celebration. Three  
hours before the ceremony was to start, the monks arrived to review the site  
and prepare for the blessing. Upon entering the ballroom, they were stunned  
and horrified. Daly had not done his research. The color scheme signified a  
death in this culture. He had to redo the entire room in less than three hours  
by adding many more colors to the décor to mitigate the predominance of  
yellow and white. He has never neglected his research since.  
Focal Points  
Focal points within the décor design are those areas and items that you want the  
audience to pay attention to and the décor elements that will be instrumental in  
defining the theme or style of the event. These will likely be the larger expenditures  
in your décor budget because they will make the largest statement in terms of your  
décor design, and they might be the best items on which to spend a small budget.  
¢ Entrances—Entrances set the tone for the experience and provide the transi-  
tion from the real world to the altered reality of the event inside. Entrances  
truly give the proverbial first impression. They can be decorated with scenic  
props, fabrics, facades, flowers, foliage, sculptures, carpet runners, balloons,  
scenic tableaux, costumed characters, live animals, searchlights, intelligent  
lights, lasers, giant puppets dancing in the air propelled by continuously  
171  
\$e 46 \#8 &  
INSIGHT 172 Coordinating the Environment  
blowing fans, banners, flags, two- or three-dimensional spandex shapes, fountains,  
gardens, colonnades, or canopies.  
° Stages—Stages include entertainment stages, platforms for presenters, dis-  
tinctive displays, and any other raised area that features activities or images  
important to the purpose of the event. They can be enclosed proscenium-  
style \(bordered on three sides\) or thrust-style with a background or presented  
in the round \(open on all sides\). They can have multiple levels, numerous  
entrances and exits, or projection screens and can include functional and  
decorative apparatus, equipment, and machinery. Stages can be stationary  
or movable. They can float out into the audience or roll from place to place  
like theatrical stage wagons.  
\* Buffets and bars—Food and beverage locations are sure to be focal points  
for guests, so the designer should use this behavioral proclivity as an oppor-  
tunity to transmit a motif message. Buffets can be a cornucopia of sensory  
effects as well as centers of theme interpretation. The buffet or bar itself can  
be a decorative \(or entertainment\) focus—it may be made of ice, neon, an  
aquarium filled with exotic fish, or industrial materials. It might be a tall  
column of spandex with shelves projecting from it \(or with hands coming  
through to give the guest a drink or an hors d’oeuvre\). It might have props  
or people floating over it or emerging from it. It might be built onto a wagon  
or cart and pushed, pulled, or driven by remote control through the party.  
\* Scenic props—From facades to flats, statues to sculptural forms, or fountains  
to giant faux foliage or animals, scenic props are used to create the theatri-  
cal illusions that alter reality. Sources for scenic props \(either in stock or  
custom-made\) include decorating companies, theatrical companies \(includ-  
ing schools and university theater departments\), scenic prop studios, and the  
venue itself. Always check the condition of the props and the costs for rental  
and installation.  
Fabrics  
Fabrics are used throughout the décor of an event—ranging from the pipe and  
drape of exhibit booths or stands to the upholstery on the chairs, to the linens on  
the tables and scrunched up on the buffet. Fabrics offer an opportunity to add  
color, texture, and patterns to the décor. You must be sure, however, that the fab-  
rics and fibers you use for decorating are flame retardant or flame resistant, either  
inherently or as a result of being treated with an additive.  
\* Drapery—Fabrics and fibers can be draped from ceiling to floor to create or  
cover walls. Deep swags of rich fabric can frame the edges of walls, windows,  
stages, or architectural obstructions. Tent poles or technical equipment such  
as light trees may be dressed with rich draping, topped with glorious poufs  
and puddled into sculptural shapes at the bottom. Suspended cylinders of The Layers of Décor  
173  
draping can disguise light fixtures and sound equipment or simply fill an  
enormous ceiling void.  
¢ Linens and napery—The most common form of fabric associated with  
events is the table linen and napkins \(or serviettes\). These are now available  
in an astounding variety of fabrics, colors, patterns, shapes, and sizes. Table  
coverings may be custom fitted to architecturally encase a table or designed  
in spandex to stretch over tables of practically any shape. Customizing and  
enhancing table fabrics is also possible via hand-painted, custom-printed,  
or iron-on transfers, or runners, weavings, or showers of ribbons from edge  
to floor.  
\* Upholstery—Chairs are being dressed for success as well. The standard  
chrome and upholstered hotel stacking chairs can be covered in sleek span-  
dex, sheer chiffon, rich velvet or brocade, and countless other fabrics. Chair  
covers can be customized with iron-on transfers of a photo of the guest of  
honor or imprinted with a corporate logo. Couches, benches, ottomans,  
and floor cushions upholstered in such fabrics as rich brocade, lush leather,  
or fake fur create intimate conversation areas or stylistic tableaux.  
# Furnishings  
Furniture and other functional or decorative furnishings are a stylistic statement  
at an event just as they are in our own homes. The way they are built and the  
materials from which they are fabricated are design elements that can reinforce a  
theme or atmosphere. An overabundance of furnishings might suggest an ornate  
historical era, be intimidating, or feel too crowded; a scarcity of furnishings may  
suggest frugality, ensure the brevity of a guest’s stay, or allow traffic flow. From  
heavyweight antiques to sleek chrome sculptural shapes, furnishings communi-  
cate a lot about where you are, what to do, and what the host wants you to think  
\(about him or her and about the event\).  
\* Tables—Tables can be used for dining, writing, display, or pure decora-  
tion. They can be made of wood, metal, glass, plastic, fiberglass, Plexiglas,  
or stone. They can be dressed with tablecloths, draping, skirting, lighting,  
corrugated metal siding, sod, neon, spandex, tile, bamboo shades, plastic  
bubble wrap, flowers, leaves, or bedsheets. They can be stationary, rolled in  
and around, suspended and floating, or they can descend from the ceiling  
for a dramatic reveal.  
© Chairs—Chairs come in many different shapes, styles, and materials, rang-  
ing from chrome to wood to wicker. In addition to chairs, places to sit  
include bales of hay, banquettes, beanbag chairs, benches, bleachers, boul-  
ders, boxes, couches, crates, cushions, overturned troughs, pews, pillows,  
platforms, stacked suitcases, stone steps, stools, thrones, or the backseat of  
a 57 Chevy. 174 Coordinating the Environment  
\* Counters and displays—Counters can be used for check-in and registra-  
tion, distributing collateral materials, serving food and drink, and displaying  
products or floral arrangements. An étagére \(a tall backless cabinet with open  
shelves\) may be used as a bar back displaying specialty liquors, pedestals may  
be used to display platters of pastry or exhibit edible sculptures, and bookcases  
may be used to hold plates and utensils at the starting point of a buffet line,  
or conference materials in a meeting room.  
\* Foliage—All sorts of potted plants, trees, bushes, arrangements, and other  
vegetation \(real or fake\) can add a touch of nature to a design and give it extra  
“life.” Foliage can be used to conceal unattractive equipment, soften edges,  
create pathways, and dress empty corners. Ficus trees, the workhorses of plant  
décor, can be laced with twinkle lights to add a sparkling dimension to practi-  
cally any setting.  
Lighting  
Lighting can illuminate and highlight, create focal points or dramatic shadows,  
and add color and dimension to all the different layers of décor. Lighting fix-  
tures can include floor lamps, table lamps, wall sconces, chandeliers, faux street  
lamps, and a broad range of theatrical lighting instruments \(discussed further  
in Chapter 7\). The designer can use lighting balloons, searchlights, floodlights,  
tiki torches, showers of twinkle lights, or a ring of cars with their headlights on.  
The savvy event designer makes the lighting a deliberately integrated part of the  
overall design.  
\* Natural—The natural or ambient light includes sunlight streaming through  
a window or skylight, firelight from a bonfire on the beach or a roaring fire  
in a fireplace, or candles of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Natural lighting may  
or may not be sufficient to provide the appropriate illumination, either in  
brightness or coverage, so it might have to be enhanced with additional light  
sources and fixtures.  
\* Functional—Functional lighting provides the illumination to perform the  
tasks associated with the event activities. It may include the houselights in a  
function room, task lighting at specific activities, or spotlighting to highlight  
specific items or displays.  
\* Decorative—The options for decorative lighting are practically infinite. Neon  
can be used to make tables, trays, and glass brick bars glow in the dark with  
brilliant color. Projections can create pools of color or an underwater fantasy.  
Chaser lights can edge a sign or stage. Plain white spandex shapes or backdrop  
draping can be saturated with colors that change throughout the event or  
pulse to the beat of the music. Even fire can be faked, either with fabric ames  
illuminated as they dance about propelled by a blower or with video projections  
shown on a screen. The Layers of Décor  
175  
# Detailing  
Detailing is related to merchandising—the addition and arrangement of ornaments  
and amenities to create an appealing presentation. These details may be added to  
any part of the overall décor, from flowers clustered around the base of a lectern  
or along the front edge of a stage, to ribbons and bouquets tied on the sides of  
chairs or pews along the aisle at a wedding ceremony. These are the added touches  
that finish the picture and give it emotional texture. And they do not have to be  
expensive—a little creativity can change the ordinary into the extraordinary.  
\* Tablescapes—The source for a microenvironment within the overall mac-  
roenvironment of theme décor is the tablescape—a work of art \(and a visual  
story\) in and of itself. Tablescaping \(like landscaping\) entails adding layer  
upon layer of detail and interest to create an evocative table setting. This  
can be very effective at banquet events when the guests spend a significant  
portion of the time seated at their tables.  
\* Place settings—The options for rented dishes, crockery, glassware, and  
utensils have increased immeasurably. These items are available in a broad  
variety of patterns, colors, detailing, shapes, and styles such as elegant, tra-  
ditional, abstract, or animalistic. Place settings can be marked with indi-  
vidual place mats or runners of virtually any material imaginable, including  
straw mats, custom imprinted fabric, slabs of stone or glass, burnished  
sheet metal, hand-carved wooden chargers, bamboo, a large banana leaf,  
bandannas, or unfolded road maps.  
\* Centerpieces and floral arrangements—Creative centerpieces may be fash-  
ioned with balloons, books, bricks, fabric, feathers, flowers \(real, silk, or  
paper\), foamcore, fruit, hardware store finds, hats, household goods, man-  
nequins, masks, metal, neon, paper, props, rocks, toys, sculptures, sporting  
goods, stuffed animals, and virtually any other material. Centerpieces can  
be freestanding, suspended, or created by the guests themselves with craft  
materials that have been placed in the center of the table \(and if butcher  
paper is used as an overlay, with crayons sprinkled around, the guests can  
illustrate their own tabletops with greetings, graphics, or graffiti\).  
\* Accessories—Candles come in countless sizes, shapes, and colors and might  
be placed in candelabras, in glass hurricane shades, on ceramic pedestals,  
or in any number of innovative containers. \(Always check the fire code for  
“open flame” regulations when using candles.\) Containers for condiments  
and edibles can be in unique shapes, patterns, textures, and materials, such  
as shells, leaves, boxes, flower pots, or any other conceivable holder.  
° Amenities—A broad assortment of gifts and other amenities might be inte-  
grated into the scene and theme, including menu cards, programs, table num-  
bers, place cards, napkin holders, and gifts. Menu cards, table numbers, and  
place cards may be printed on or attached to numerous objects or materials. 176 Coordinating the Environment  
Napkins might be folded in dozens of ways and ornamented with memen-  
tos or thematic details.  
Staging Considerations  
Creating an event environment can include a vast array of products, services, equip-  
ment, and labor to provide the framework for the functional and decorative com-  
ponents of the design. The extent of the staging requirements will be determined  
based on the type of event, existing venue capabilities and constraints, functional  
requirements, time, budget, and human resources. Although volunteers, family  
members, or untrained staff may be used to set up many of your event decorations,  
only experienced, well-trained, and, in some cases, licensed professionals should  
be employed to erect and install the staging equipment such as stages, scaffolding  
constructions \(e.g., sound wing bays\), tents, flooring systems, and any other tem-  
porary structures. These professional decorators or contractors should be selected  
early and included in the planning process.  
# Stages  
Stages and platforms might be needed and used for entertainment attractions, vis-  
ibility of presentations, technical platforms, camera platforms, runways, bridging  
platforms, or to add multiple levels to a function room or turn a swimming pool  
into a dining or dancing area \(there are even floating platforms on which a pianist  
and a grand piano drift around the pool\). “Apart from the usual applications for  
concerts and events, Showtech Australia has put scaffold platforms and stages in  
some rather unusual places—over pools, fountains, in the ocean/bay, and even in a  
lake” \(www.showtechaustralia.com.au\).  
Stages might be a permanent feature of a facility such as a theater or auditorium,  
constructed with scaffolding and decking specifically for an event, or they may be  
portable. Portable stages can be modular sections that roll in and fold out, or they  
can be self-contained trucks or trailers that are driven in and opened up, which  
are effective for undeveloped or temporary outdoor sites. Mobile trailer stages are  
sometimes attached together to provide a larger performance area.  
Modular staging sections might be configured to create a stage of practically any  
size and geometric shape and are usually available in various sizes \(3 X 4 ft, 3 X 6 ft,  
3X 8 ft, 4 X 4 ft, 4 X 6 ft, and 4 X 8 ft\) with a selection of leg lengths \(8, 16, 24,  
32, and 40 inches\). Other stage equipment includes guardrails and handrails, stairs  
and ramps, choral risers, bandstand or stage shells, stage-front barrier systems, roof  
trussing, and wheelchair lifts. Not all stages must be perpendicular to the audience  
\(see Figure 6.3\), and you are encouraged to cut out templates of standafd staging  
sections and play around with them to design creative configurations. Staging Considerations

Depending on what is to take place on the stage, the levelness of the stage  
might be an important factor. Uneven stages can cause problems for dancers and  
other performers, not to mention the possibility of heavy packing cases rolling  
off. Robert Estrin of Creative Event Technology recalls leveling a stage to precise  
specifications for a circus-style performer whose act was performed while he was  
on a unicycle. “A centimeter or two of slope or crown could have thrown off his  
performance.” Estrin notes that uneven ridges in a stage surface can be and often  
are caused by a rubber cap missing from the bottom of a leg. These uneven ridges  
can become a trip hazard, which is not solved simply by taping over them. Estrin  
recommends that all modular stage sections be clamped together.  
# Flooring  
The most common flooring considered in the context of an event is the dance  
floor. Dance floors usually come in 3 X 3 ft \(0.91 X 0.91m\) or 3 X 4 ft \(0.91  
X 1.22 m\) sections. Dance floors can also be used for exhibits, VIP tents, food  
service area flooring, or for creating distinctive entryways and pathways. Dance  
floor sections are connected via a tongue-and-groove locking system, often  
stabilized with screws, and should be edged with a raked border ramp to transition  
from floor to dance floor without posing a trip hazard.  
Temporary flooring may also be required for tents or marquees erected on uneven  
outdoor surfaces, or to protect a surface from the staging \(and the construction of  
that staging\). Arenas that change from ice hockey to motocross racing to exposition  
177  
Figure 6.3  
Diagonal Stage Layout  
with Dance Floor 178  
Coordinating the Environment  
and sport stadiums with turf protect the primary surface with plywood, homosote  
\(a compressed cardboard primarily used to cover ice rinks\), or other material. Special  
flooring might be required for certain sports or might have to be protected in sports  
arenas. Professional dancers \(e.g., tap, ballet, jazz, modern, lyrical, Irish dancing, clog-  
ging, flamenco, and others\) often require special sprung wood or cushioned flooring  
and a controlled-slip floor covering to prevent accidents and injuries \(you should get  
the exact specifications from the particular dance troupe\).  
# Tenting  
Tents and marquees come in an astounding variety of shapes and sizes, from pop-up  
canopies to pole tents, semipermanent clearspan tents to high-peaked circus tents,  
or tensile structures to two-story tents. They can be square, rectangular, circular,  
hexagonal, or oval; they can create a bandshell or look like a pagoda. They can  
have plain side walls, window walls, hard walls, clear walls, domes, and doors.  
Tents can be brightly striped, white, clear, or made of custom fabrics. They can  
be customized with liners, draping, lighting, heating, cooling, flooring, carpeting,  
and chandeliers. Tent installations have been used to create covered walkways  
or to cover hundreds of thousands of square feet at air shows, trade shows, and  
festivals. Tents may be installed in the most seemingly inaccessible spots—the  
Maryland-based company Losberger U.S., LLC \(www.losberger.com\), once had  
to have a crane reach over a house to install a tent structure.  
A tenting professional must survey a tent site so that the structure will be  
positioned and installed correctly \(and without causing damage to surfaces or  
sprinkler systems\). A tent must be anchored properly to ensure stability and wind  
tolerance, and the tent fabric or material must meet fire safety codes. The site  
preparation and installation must be included in the budget and the schedule.  
Depending on the size or type of tent structure and the location where it will be  
installed, this can be costly, but having a temporary ballroom on a bluff overlooking  
the ocean might be worth the expense.

# INSIGHT  
Virgin Galactic, the world’s first commercial tourism space flight service  
founded by Sir Richard Branson, held an unveiling and christening of its new  
spaceship at the Mojave Air and Spaceport 100 miles east of Los Angeles on  
December 7, 2009. The press conference and after-party for 800 guests, held  
in a 200-foot clearspan tent valued at about \$200,000, took place despite  
severe weather warnings. Luckily, the guests were required to evacuate due  
to increasing hurricane-force winds before gusts of up to 116 miles per hour  
turned the brand new tent into 15,000 pounds of recyclable rubble.

Because the tent was installed on concrete each tent leg was weighted  
down with 4,000 pounds of concrete blocks rather than staked, which,  
according to factory specifications, still ensured the structure was rated safe  
for continuous winds of 40 miles per hour and gusts up to 70. Organizers and  
local officials continually monitored the winds, and when there was a forecast  
for stronger winds the evacuation order was issued. Approximately 20 min-  
utes after guests were loaded onto motor coaches and driven away the tent  
“literally took off?”

Making and Masking the Magic  
To sustain an illusion, a magician uses misdirection and carefully disguises or hides  
the mechanics of the magic. Making event magic requires the same care. Staging  
equipment may be minimal or extensive, but should always be considered in terms of  
visibility and aesthetics. Professional event coordinators know it can take a small army  
outfitted with a vast amount of equipment and materials to create an event environment,  
but the audience does not necessarily need to see that. Stages should be designed to  
either incorporate or conceal technical equipment such as projection screens, loud-  
speakers, microphones, lights, wires, cables, and other mechanics. Backstage may  
look like a cacophony of paraphernalia \(even though neatly arranged\), but the front  
of the stage should look deliberate and clean.  
Projection screens should be dressed with valances, skirts, and/or screen sur-  
rounds that complement the rest of the stage setting. Sound wings should be draped  
or decorated to look like an integrated part of the overall design. Sound monitors  
for musicians or confidence monitors for speakers may be dressed with a few potted  
plants or floral arrangements in front. Electrical cords should be completely taped  
down, preferably along the edge of the stage. The hotel lectern \(which usually bears  
an insignia of the hotel\) may be dressed with the event’s own banner or draping,  
with rich folds drawn taut. The stage and all risers should be skirted or faced with  
décor material. Pipe and drape draping panels should be clipped along the back  
seams with clothespins or clamps to ensure that they remain closed. This is not  
necessarily something that technical or AV providers automatically think about. You  
must manage the final visual image.  
Rigging and Installation  
The professional event coordinator must become familiar with the rigging and  
installation requirements for all décor and equipment to be incorporated into 180 Coordinating the Environment  
the event design. These requirements will have an impact on the site selected, the  
budget, the production schedule, and the labor needs. For anything rigged  
overhead, there must be a rigging system sufficient to ensure the safety of both  
the installers and the audience beneath. This may include a grid system, beams  
and battens, steel cables, a truss system, and chain motor system. It is important  
to know the weight restrictions or load limits so that the system is not overloaded  
with too much or too heavy equipment or that too much stress is put on any one  
section or rigging point. These factors must be discussed with the technical providers,  
particularly if more than one supplier or subcontractor is used to provide  
various parts of the program \(e.g., decorator, AV provider, lighting company, etc.\).  
It is also important to consider any aerial effects or entertainment, such as cirque-  
style performers, that requires rigged apparatus \(e.g., harness, trapeze, cradle,  
cloud swing, bungee rigging, or guy wires for flying\).  
Equipment and décor installed on the floor or on the ground also require atten-  
tion. Light or sound trees must be installed and anchored so they do not tip over.  
All props, facades, and freestanding décor elements must be securely braced and  
weighted down. Sandbags work well for this purpose, but they are not what you  
would call “décor details.” You must think of the entire picture, from floor to ceiling  
and wall to wall. When using a chain motor system to create a descending dessert  
table or buffet, make certain to test it thoroughly or you might have dust and debris  
descending on the food while the table is descending to the floor \(you might need a  
decorative cover for the food presentation during the descent\).  
An overhead rigging system might be suspended or rigged from two bracing trees  
or ground supports, which have telescopic legs that extend out to provide the necessary  
balance. This might look like a small dot on your floor plan for the bracing tree; its  
effect can be somewhat greater, as those extended legs can become a tripping hazard  
\(not to mention their cosmetic appearance, or lack thereof\). You will need to mask  
these as well. You must also have the right installation equipment \(i.e., lifts, ladders,  
scaffolding\) and sufficient time to do the job. Safety is paramount. Rigging and  
installation of staging equipment is a complicated and possibly hazardous job, with  
potentially catastrophic consequences if it is not done correctly, and riggers are often  
licensed for this reason. You must use professionals.  
Rental Equipment  
Almost anything you need to develop and decorate an event environment can  
be rented from a rental company or equipment-for-hire dealer. If you need por-  
table picket fencing to create a charming walkway or to edge a concession area,  
wrought-iron arches and kneeling benches for the perfect wedding ceremony, or  
partitions to segment a large space, rental equipment is available to meet the needs  
of the event \(see Figure 6.4\). Installation equipment such as ladders and lifts are  
available as well. However, this seemingly unexciting installation equipment need Signs and Signals 181

or self-pickup, installation, and returning items after the event.

Signs and Signals  
Almost every type of event requires some sort of signage or symbolic signal system  
to help the audience and/or other “users” understand and experience the event  
environment in a positive manner. Signs facilitate getting from “here” to “there,”  
provide reassurance, create a welcoming environment, manage trafhc flow \(pedes-  
trian and vehicular\), and answer questions before they need to be asked \(see Figure  
6.5\). Signage should be visible, plentiful, positioned properly, and appropriate in  
content and style.  
The communication principles of signage are grounded in the sciences of way-  
finding \(Lynch 1960\) and semiotics, originated by Charles Sanders Pierce and  
Ferdinand de Saussure in the nineteenth century. Wayfinding relates to the study of  
environmental communication and “organizing and defining a field of messages  
to make an area as self-navigatable as possible” \(www.uande.com.au/wayfinding  
html\). The science of semiotics relates to the study of signs and their alphabets, 182

meanings, connections, and attitudes expressed, and is based on the premise that  
“communication is an act of information exchange by means of sign systems” \(www  
.solki.jyu.fi/semiotics/glossary.htm\).  
Providing Cues and Information  
Event signage, like any other signage, uses verbal and nonverbal cues to commu-  
nicate essential and interesting information to event-goers and others. Signs work  
only if there is an agreement about the appropriate uses of and responses to a sign,  
sometimes related to cultural biases. Providing cues and information at events  
often incorporates the full range of signal aspects, from words and numbers to  
color and shape, as well as symbols and icons such as the international pictographs  
illustrated in Figure 6.6 for male and female, elevators, stairs, toilets, and so forth.  
\(The icon for female is depicted wearing a skirt; however, this is not a universal  
clothing distinction, illustrating the fact that icons and symbols must be mutually  
agreed upon.\)  
Information and instructions using both words and icons \(including illustra-  
tions and photographs\) might be placed on a sign positioned so that an individual  
might operate a mechanism, perform an action, or learn more about a topic or  
exhibit. Audible signals can include “human arrows” \(uniformed or costumed  
individuals positioned in stationary locations to provide directional assistance to  
attendees\), public address announcements, or heraldic music indicating the start  
of a ceremony or the entrance of a significant individual. Braille and audio signs  
might be required to comply with the requirements of handicapped accessible  
legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\). How a sign is  
designed affects how effective the communication will be; using high-contrast  
colors makes a sign more visible and legible, and adding simple graphics improves  
comprehension. Signs and Signals

INFORMATION TELEPHONE FOOD SERVICE FIRST AID  
Navigational Aids  
One of the primary purposes for signs and other signals at an event is to provide  
directional, navigational, and orientation assistance. Signs providing navigation  
choices, overview maps, and decision-point placements enhance the ability of the  
attendee to get in and around the event site in a manner that meets the objectives  
of the attendee and delivers the progressive event experience as designed. Common  
examples of these types of signs include “You Are Here” site maps, enlarged seating  
charts or shuttle bus routes \(and schedules\), and aisle banners. An overview site  
map allows the individual to establish his or her own orientation within the mac-  
roenvironment of the event site, as well as to determine the hierarchy of features  
and areas of interest.  
A person’ ability to make the correct \(or preferable\) navigational choices may be  
enhanced by creating “visual magnets” or sneak previews of areas or activities ahead.  
This may be accomplished by including storytelling on signage, using distinctive land-  
marks, or laying out the space so that inviting sight lines are established. For education  
sessions at a conference, for example, a slide or data projector could be projecting a  
colorful title, opening, or “welcome” slide on the screen that might be seen from the  
door to the meeting room.  
Figure 6.6  
International  
Pictographic Icons 184 Coordinating the Environment  
Incorporating the Theme and Image  
Signs should be a part of the décor and ambiance, but they must also be distinctive  
from it. They should always be of good quality \(quickly hand-drawn signs rarely look  
professional\), and they should be integrated into the theme image. This is a branding  
issue. The event logo or theme icons should be on each sign, with the exception of  
statutory and warning signs \(Bowdin et al. 2006\). Although the wording or graph-  
ics might be influenced by semiotic principles \(simple, declarative words or phrases  
and unambiguous icons\), there is wide latitude for creative presentation methods  
and designs. Graphical branding will be particularly important if there are numerous  
events taking place concurrently or contiguously. Branding objectives will also be criti-  
cally important to civic, corporate, and/or commercial sponsors of an event. Banners  
on light posts or spanning city streets, for example, announce a festival, welcome  
conventioneers, and contribute to community pride.  
Signage Technicalities  
The professional event coordinator must also consider the installation requirements  
and restrictions of the signage selected. Most venues prohibit attaching signs to walls  
or doors with tape or tacks. In lieu of attaching signs, easels might be used, but these  
must be positioned so they do not become a tripping hazard. Many venues have discreet  
wall-mounted sign holders next to meeting rooms that must be used for session  
placards. Others restrict signage altogether or limit it to specific dimensions that fit  
within custom-built easels. Using décor elements as nonverbal cues might overcome  
these restrictions and extend the theme imaging \(e.g., balloon arches, inflatables, theatri-  
cal lighting, etc.\). Special rigging might be required for hanging banners, and outdoor  
banners must have wind cuts so that they will not be damaged or cause damage to the  
rigging support. Special lift equipment might also be necessary—aerial lifts indoors  
and bucket trucks or cherry pickers outdoors.  
Directional, informational, decorative, and safety signage is placed to facilitate  
the event attendees’ comfort, enjoyment, and welfare. Signs must be visible, easy  
to read and understand, and must communicate the right information at the right  
time. They direct or control traffic flow, identify important facilities or features,  
and/or impart educational content. They should be carefully considered in developing  
the site plan and theme concept so that they will constitute an integrated component  
of the overall event experience.  
Wrap Up  
That there is a setting for every event is inevitable, whether it is inherent or imposed.  
This environment within which the event takes place must be legible in order to  
deliver the experience designed and desired. A theme is often used as a device Wrap Up  
185  
to compress the overall concept or message into an image that is quickly understood  
and anticipated, and, when used, should be integrated throughout the entire event  
experience. A vast array of décor options may be used to create a thematic or ambi-  
ent atmosphere that serves the purpose and objectives of the event and meets the  
needs and expectations of the audience. The professional event coordinator has  
the opportunity to enhance the event environment and event experience through  
careful attention to every facet and feature of the event facility, top to bottom and  
wall to wall, using décor items and illusions.  
Creating an effective and expressive environment requires equipment, which  
must be procured, delivered, and installed properly. Staging equipment of all types  
and sizes can be rented to meet the functional requirements of the event as designed,  
and may be arranged in hundreds of creative configurations. It must, however,  
always be anchored and/or rigged correctly, to ensure the safety of workers and  
guests, and dressed so as to mask the mechanics of the magic of the event.  
The professional event coordinator must make certain that the event environ-  
ment is user-friendly for those in attendance, providing multisensory cues and  
tools that will allow guests or visitors to get to, around, and through the site in a  
manner that meets their needs and objectives while communicating the messages  
required and desired by the event host. Signage and other visual communication  
tools should not be an afterthought—they should be fully integrated into the  
theme and/or image of the décor.

A. You have just won the contract to design a ten-city product launch and  
sales event for a new series of dolls and action figures based on popular  
cartoon characters. The theme must be designed to attract children and  
adults. The event is to be a two-day festival-like entertainment and activity  
spectacle staged in parking lots, which will travel to a shopping mall in a  
different city every other weekend and is expected to attract 15,000 people  
at each site.  
You have been hired to design a one-day in-plant employee training and moti-  
vational event for a telemarketing company selling cellular telephone calling  
plans. The employees are 98 percent male, between 21 and 25 years old, and  
extremely competitive. The company needs to deliver five key training mes-  
sages about new rules and restrictions imposed by government regulatory  
agencies, but management wants the event to have a theme and to be fun for  
the employees so that they will participate.  
You have been asked to design and coordinate a theme party for a dual cel-  
ebration of a father’s fiftieth birthday and his daughter's bat mitzvah. The  
theme needs to reflect father and daughter equally, yet they have no par-  
ticular hobbies or interests in common. They want the party to take place ina  
tent in their expansive backyard, and it is to include dinner, dancing for both  
adults and youngsters, and other activities to keep their guests entertained  
for the entire evening.

costs for investment in each. The client was enthralled with all the creative ideas pro-  
posed for the theme décor, food and beverages, and entertainment, which included  
special props, elaborate buffet displays, nationally known speakers, specialty acts, and  
an interactive dance band. As they reached the technical category on the investment

simply asked, “You want your guests to be able to see and hear what you've paid for,  
don't you?"

Modern events have a plethora of production tools available to enhance,  
enchant, excite, and enthrall guests and audiences. Lighting, sound, and other  
audiovisual technology, plus special effects, are the production values that sup-  
port the theatrical dimensions of an event experience—the show. This technology  
allows the event designer and professional event coordinator to highlight and/or  
hide parts of the event environment and the event program in order to commu-  
nicate the message of the event in the most effective manner, at the appropriate  
or most effective time during the event. It might be used to reveal program ele-  
ments or products, transform spaces or create illusions, direct and redirect focus  
and movement, and choreograph the progression of the event experience from an  
entrancing entrance to a thrilling finale.  
Crafting the Production  
Whether the event experience is self-directed \(e.g., a festival\) or carefully con-  
trolled \(e.g., an awards gala\), it is a show or performance, one that is carefully .  
crafted to deliver a message and a meaning. The professional event coordinator  
must look at an event as an entire production, similar to a theatrical, film, or  
television production, focusing on what \(and how\) the attendee will see and hear  
during the event. The act of producing the event must also be considered from the  
initial design stages to the load-in through the load-out \(also known as bump-in  
and bump-out\); recognizing the options available and the operational concerns  
associated with the choices made. Crafting the Production  
191  
Specify Goals, Objectives, and Priorities  
With all the high-tech and high-touch tools available to the production or event  
designer, it is critically important to determine which tools will meet the needs, pur-  
pose, and budget of an event. Decorative lighting, sound, projection, video, and  
numerous special effects might be added to any event, but they are not requisite for  
all events. They must be incorporated into the event design only if they will enhance  
the achievement of the goals and objectives of the event. However, virtually any event  
can benefit from the inclusion of production technology to create or enhance the  
environment, the atmosphere, learning, interaction, enjoyment, and effective com-  
munication. In fact, due to the prevalence of television, film, video, and other theatri-  
cal productions in their day-to-day lives, audiences and attendees expect sophisticated  
production values similar to those they see in other entertainment media.  
Production technology is changing and improving every day, and the tools we  
are familiar with now might become outdated in a short time. This is not to say  
that older technology is no longer useful. All audiovisual technology, old and new,  
has potential for creative and effective applications in an event production. It is up  
to the professional event coordinator to work with the client and other stakehold-  
ers to determine which technologies will deliver the event experience desired and  
required, within the confines of the event budget, site, schedule, and program,  
and which will be the most effective for delivering the message of the event in a  
manner that meets the needs of its audience.  
Integrate the Technology  
Technology should support the event production, not become the focus \(unless  
the purpose of the event itself is to highlight such technology\). Lighting should  
illuminate rather than overpower the environment. Sound systems should make  
communication possible rather than painful. Projected visuals should communi-  
cate rather than distract. Computer data presentations and videos should be used  
to enhance a speaker’s presentation rather than overwhelm it. You use production  
technology because you should, not because you can.  
The professional event coordinator should integrate the technology selected  
into the event site design, the program design, and the overall production. Each  
type of equipment will have spatial and installation requirements that must be  
plotted into the floor or site plan as well as the production schedule. Each type of  
technology will have design capabilities and qualities that must be utilized cost-  
effectively. And each type of technology will have conditions and constraints that  
must be understood in order to get the most out of it.  
Use the Right Effects for the Job  
You must determine what it is you want and need to achieve in order to select the  
right effects and equipment for the job, based on the resources \(time, money, space\) 192 Fundamentals of the Production  
available. For example, rear projection requires more space than front pro-  
jection, but it gives a cleaner look to the event space because the projection  
equipment is hidden. However, front projection might be brighter than rear  
projection, and the equipment might be suspended from the ceiling to open  
up the floor space.  
Live video for image magnification can involve camera operators moving in and  
around the stage and audience, or robotic cameras could be moved through the  
space on booms and tracks by remote operators. Intelligent lighting systems are  
more expensive, but they are more versatile and might replace the need for numer-  
ous other lighting instruments. \(Most lighting professionals refer to these lights as  
automated or moving lights, with an intelligent operator controlling them.\)  
Handling Technical Difficulties  
As with any technology, lighting, sound, and multimedia technology is subject to  
breakdowns, failures, and other problems that interfere with a seamless produc-  
tion. The more technology you are using \(and relying on\), the more safeguards  
you should consider to prevent such problems from destroying your carefully  
crafted production. For any important aspect of an event production, securing  
back-up equipment must be seriously considered.  
Another important safeguard is making sure that the technical providers have  
sufficient time to prepare, install, and test their equipment properly. You must  
incorporate technical rehearsals into your schedule so that the entire production  
can be tested, and in the manner in which it should be tested. For example, in  
order to test the lighting the houselights must be extinguished, meaning that  
others working in the space will not have the illumination they need to do their  
jobs properly. Sound checks must be done, which can be loud and disjointed  
and might interfere with a meeting or other function taking place next door.  
Data and video projection must be well rehearsed, and transitions between vari-  
ous technologies \(e.g., live and recorded sound or video\) must be practiced. All  
such testing requires time.  
If, despite these measures, there is a technical failure, be prepared to carry  
on. This is when a calm and quick-thinking professional event coordinator  
will find a creative solution. You might bring out the a cappella choir early,  
turn on the houselights and have the guests or attendees discuss topics in a  
roundtable-style session, or send in the dessert while you wait for the prob-  
lem to be fixed. If the technical failure is obvious, the audience will know \(or  
should be told\) that you are having difficulties—“Please stand by.” A good  
emcee, speaker, or entertainer will be able to incorporate such an incident  
into his or her presentation with humor and grace, preventing uncertainty  
\(or panic\) within the audience. Lighting  
193  
Buy the Best You Can Afford  
Based on the prioritized goals and objectives for the event, you should always buy  
the best production values you can afford. Selecting equipment and providers based  
on price alone is a recipe for disappointment and difficulties. When the budget is  
limited, focus your expenditures on those features that will communicate the mes-  
sage and content most effectively, and then supplement them with the creative use  
of less expensive options sparingly. Find ways to utilize the technology you do invest  
in to its fullest potential, perhaps redesigning the program or the use of the site so  
that one type of technology or equipment can serve numerous facets of the event.  
Also purchase the best service you can afford. Make certain that on-site techni-  
cians are included in the bid. Check the costs of power usage. Closely compare  
the bids from providers who own their equipment and those who must rent or  
hire it from other sources. Those who own their own equipment often have lower  
prices, but they might be using older equipment. Those who subcontract equip-  
ment might have higher costs, but they might be securing better or more up-to-  
date equipment. As always, you must be a savvy buyer. Become familiar with  
the production technologies available, including those discussed throughout this  
chapter, so that you are able to work with the designers and production providers  
to create the environment you want and communicate the messages you need to  
communicate in the most cost-efficient and effective manner possible.  
Lightin ghting  
Performance lighting expert Nick Moran \(2007, 6\) considers lighting design as  
“painting and drawing in space” to “reveal and alter the form and color of objects  
and people. It can guide and frame our vision. . . it can change the way we experi-  
ence life.” Theatrical production and stagecraft is the milieu from which many  
event professionals draw for creative lighting applications. Studying production  
techniques for plays, dance performances, operas, musicals, concerts, ice shows,  
and other presentations gives the professional event coordinator a strong under-  
standing of the options suitable for events of all types.  
Illuminate the Space and the Investment  
The first consideration in a lighting design is to illuminate the event space in such  
a way that it is safe and draws the guest or attendee’s focus to where it should  
be. As noted in the opening of this chapter, you want the audience to be able  
to see what you have paid for \(and what they have paid for\). Lighting could,  
indeed, become your primary source of décor, used to establish a mood or theme  
or to illuminate and accentuate the inherent features of the event venue. The 194 Fundamentals of the Production  
manipulation of color, intensity, and texture through lighting allows you to create  
the alternate reality of a themed environment, direct attention to key messages or  
images, and move people where you want them to go.  
The professional event coordinator should make sure that the primary areas of  
activity are literally “attractive’—attracting people and attention to them. Areas of  
activity must also be suitably lit for the function to be carried out—providing suf-  
ficient illumination for taking notes at an educational session or seeing the keynote  
speaker at a conference or the food at a banquet. In an indoor venue, this can some-  
times be accomplished simply with the houselights, but not always. We have all been  
in seminars where the lights were dimmed at the front of the room so that the screen  
images were visible, yet the speaker was in the dark and, often, so were we. This prob-  
lem might be overcome with a simple spotlight focused on the speaker and lectern.  
The professional event coordinator most often works with a lighting provider,  
and sometimes an audiovisual provider, to procure the appropriate design and  
equipment for the specific event, based on its type and purpose. These profession-  
als should be brought into the event design process in the early planning stages  
so they understand the scope of the lighting needs in conjunction with the over-  
all event. The tools and lighting instruments available vary in cost, installation  
requirements, and capabilities \(see Figure 7.1\). Armed with an understanding of  
these tools, you will be able to collaborate with the lighting providers in achieving  
the look and effects desired \(see Figure 7.2\), at an affordable price.

Figure 7.2  
Lighting Effects  
Working with the Dimensions of Light  
Lighting has three dimensions—intensity, location, and color—that the lighting  
designer uses to paint or sculpt the desired effect. Intensity refers to the amount of  
light present or perceived by the human eye, which is determined by the brightness  
or power of the total output of the lighting source \(e.g., bulb or lamp\), most often Lighting  
197  
expressed in lumens \(one lumen equals the brightness of one candle\). Intensity will  
decrease and disperse as the distance increases between the light source and the  
object onto which the light falls; a factor that must be considered when choosing  
projectors and screen size and placement. Higher intensities can direct attention and  
create focal points, lower intensities can illuminate without competing with focal  
points, and intensity will be affected by the relative intensity of the immediate area.  
Moran \(2007, 230\) notes that light travels in a straight line, but it is reflected  
off the surfaces it hits, and that we do not “see” light, only that which it illumi-  
nates \(which does not necessarily mean solid objects only; light can be reflected  
off smoke or water\). The standard setup for lighting an object or individual is  
“key, back, and fill” \(see definitions in Figure 7.2\) so the shadows created by each  
light position will be dimensional rather than distorted or dramatic \(unless dra-  
matic is what you are going for\). Campbell \(1999, 71\) notes that lighting angles  
are divided into five categories\: front, side, back, down, and up. Walters \(1997, 7\)  
suggests that lights aimed 45 degrees downward, from 45 degrees side front, onto  
a person is the most flattering lighting \(and does not blind the person\). Monroe  
\(2006\) recommends a three-point system using the key light, a fill light at a lower  
angle from the opposite side, and a back light. Interesting dimensions are achieved  
when different colors are projected on different sides of an object or person, cre-  
ating sculptural shadows and effects. The lighting designer should take this into  
consideration when lighting people, props, and architectural features.  
Color, as in other aspects of the event design, can have a significant physical,  
psychological, and emotional impact on the effect of lighting. Yellows and straws  
soften, reds warm, and blues isolate. Pinks and ambers are very flattering for food,  
but white lights should also be used to provide a true impression of a food’s actual  
color \(and appetizing freshness\). Early in my event career, a lighting designer advised  
me to always incorporate at least one item of white into the décor and to make cer-  
tain it was illuminated with pure white light so that the human eye could discern  
the saturation of the other hues. Just as a television camera needs to be “told” what  
color is white in order to calibrate all other colors, our eyes need the same cue.  
Lighting as Entertainment and Environment  
Lighting professionals know how to craft a light show that will be decorative and  
truly entertaining. These productions are very popular as an integral part of an  
entertainment element, pulsing and moving with the beat of the music of a dance  
band or disc jockey. Moving and flashing lights and images swirling around guests  
capture, retain, and enhance interest \(and excitement\) in the event experience.  
Lighting can also serve as instantaneous, interactive, or automated scenery. With  
today’s technology, lighting effects and light shows might be produced indoors  
and outdoors, on walls, floors, ceilings, scenic shapes, the sides of buildings or 198 Fundamentals of the Production  
tents, and with the use of specialized net screens, even in “thin air.” Digital light-  
ing \(using a video projector\) can create high-definition background scenery that  
changes as the event progresses; light screens or projections can react to human  
touch to draw patterns or movement in real time; LED lights can be integrated  
into drapes or nets to create full-color static or moving images on cue; and radio  
location systems \(e.g., radio frequency identification—RFID\) can react to or fol-  
low the movement of performers or partygoers.  
Many event productions use automated lighting instruments \(intelligent  
lighting\) to add intense and moving color and shapes to the event environment.  
These computer-controlled instruments are able to change position, direction,  
color, and gobo or image projection quickly and accurately, allowing you to  
create exciting effects. The movement of automated lights is programmed into  
a computer within a control console, and many systems allow the designer to  
create the lighting plan in a virtual three-dimensional setting. These computer-  
aided design \(CAD\) programs allow the designer to create light plans, floor  
plans, elevations, digital set models, and photorealistically rendered animations  
and simulations with lighting visualization software. Once the finished design  
is programmed into the computer and the lighting instruments are positioned,  
the show progresses at the touch of a button.  
Equipment Needs and Rigging Requirements  
Virtually all lighting instruments must be mounted on the floor, flown from a rig-  
ging system overhead, or hung on battens, booms, ladders \(not the climbing type\),  
towers, trees, tripod stands, or trusses. The lighting instruments must then be con-  
nected to the power source and the control console. Because much of this equip-  
ment must be mounted overhead, care must be taken to ensure that it is installed  
and rigged properly. Flown \(suspended\) lighting instruments must be clamped  
and secured properly, often with a safety chain in addition to a clamp for extra  
security. This is a job for professionals only, and one that should not be rushed.  
Some venues have built-in rigging points with overhead catwalks; others do not.  
‘Truss modules now come in circular and other configurations and are often  
dressed with opaque material that becomes part of the overall décor, serving as  
a light shape. All installation equipment not flown should be dressed or masked  
appropriately to blend into or become part of the décor. Lighting instruments  
positioned on the floor for uplighting can be masked with potted foliage, which  
will provide additional texture and dimension, as the spill light will illuminate the  
greenery. Lighting trees and tripods can be dressed with fabrics to resemble richly  
draped columns. The lighting equipment must also be integrated with all sound  
and audiovisual equipment because these items will likely be sharing some of the  
same rigging and mounting systems. Audiovisual—Sound Support  
199  
You must liaise with the lighting professional to ensure that this equipment  
will be integrated into the overall décor and floor or site plan. The lighting pro-  
fessional should be involved in a site inspection to determine the installation,  
rigging, and equipment requirements for the lighting plan. Sam Shei, director of  
Hong Kong-based Showbiz Creation Limited, points out, “The lighting designer  
considers the structure of venue to enhance better lighting effects using appropri-  
ate lighting equipment, but some might plan on using the equipment they are  
most conversant with without considering the feasibility of loading and locating  
the gear inside the venue.”  
Audiovisual—Sound Support  
As with other production technology, the products and equipment used for  
sound and audiovisual \(AV\) support are evolving and emerging at a fast pace,  
and as each new technology enters the entertainment industry it is quickly  
adopted by the event industry. The type and scope of technology the profes-  
sional event coordinator will use depends on the needs it will be used to meet  
\(see Figure 7.3\). This equipment can range from a simple in-house public  
address \(PA\) system, with a single microphone on a lectern for a seminar or  
a cassette player hidden in the buffet display producing sound effects, to a  
full-fledged concert setup with stacks and stacks of loudspeakers, stage moni-  
tors, amplifiers, image magnification video, and a control console the size of a  
pickup truck with six or seven headphoned technicians poised like aerospace  
engineers over it. But the purpose will be the same—to provide the audio and  
visual reinforcement needed to create the desired event experience.  
Audio Basics  
An understanding of how we hear and the basics of sound amplification can assist  
in determining the best equipment and effects for the job at hand, as well as pique  
the imagination for creative applications. We hear sound by detecting the vibra-  
tions of sound waves within our ear and transforming those vibrations into nerve  
impulses sent to our brain. These sound waves come in at different frequencies—  
the time between or rate of recurrence of waves, and are referred to as high or low  
pitch. Ultrasonic frequencies are those higher than the typical hearing range for  
humans; infrasonic are those below hearing range, but can be felt through physical  
body vibration. The pressure level of the sound wave as it hits our ear determines  
how loud or quiet the sound is, and is measured in decibels. Therefore, sound has  
two qualities—volume \(decibels\) and pitch \(frequency\).  
Decibels \(dB\) typically range from zero \(the average least perceptible sound\) to  
about 120dB \(the average pain level\). According to the Center for Hearing and 200\: Fundamentals of the Production

Audiovisual Communication \(2010\), “Experts agree that continued exposure to noise above  
Equipment Checklist  
85. dB will eventually harm your hearing. Noise levels above 140 dB can cause  
damage to hearing after just one exposure.” Putting this in the context of events\:  
¢ Anything over 60dB \(e.g., background music\) often makes conversation  
difficult.  
¢ Anything above 70dB \(e.g \(oP\)

° ‘Typical rock music comes in at 110 to 130 dB \(at 130 decibels, hearing dam-  
age can occur after three minutes\). Audiovisual—Sound Support  
201  
Pitch has a range between two tonal levels—bass \(low frequency\) and treble  
\(high frequency\). Treble or higher notes are directional and stop when they hit  
a surface. Bass or lower notes are omnidirectional, travel farther, and can seep  
through walls, which is why you can hear the thump, thump, thump of a ste-  
reo system being played next door. This is also why, when dressing or masking  
loudspeakers, you must use gauze or other open-weave material so that it will not  
distort the treble balance of the sound.  
Sound amplification is the process of converting the sound waves of a voice  
or acoustic musical instrument into electrical impulses \(the signal\) through a  
microphone\(s\) or connecting an electronic musical instrument or record, CD,  
DVD, or cassette player\(s\) to a mixer. The mixer modulates quality and volume  
levels \(with an equalizer\) and routes the signal into an amplifier to increase the  
strength of the signal, which sends it to the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker changes  
the electrical impulses back into acoustical energy and transmits the amplified  
audible sound. \(Note\: The high, annoying squeal of feedback is caused when a  
microphone is receiving the sound waves projected from the loudspeaker, creating  
an ever-increasing loop of amplification.\)  
Many types of microphones are available, which should be selected based on  
the type of event, use, user, and sound amplification requirements. A microphone  
\(often referred to as a mic or mike\) is either omnidirectional \(picking up sound  
in all directions\) or unidirectional \(picking up sound from one direction, referred  
to as cartioid\) and may be wired or wireless. A wired microphone is wired directly  
into the sound mixer, and a wireless microphone sends the sound via a radio  
signal to a receiver connected to the mixer and may be handheld, clipped to an  
individual’s clothing or a sound source, or used as a body mic incorporated into a  
headset. Wearers of wireless lavaliere or body mics must be advised to turn them  
off when not performing to prevent the amplification of ambient noise, such as  
produced when whispering to a colleague or going to the toilet.  
Sound Equipment  
Depending on the size of the event space and the effects desired, the type, quan-  
tity, and positioning of sound equipment will vary. Simple PA systems may  
include only a microphone connected to a combination amplifier/loudspeaker.  
Amplifying sound for a large space may involve several loudspeakers stacked on  
top of each other to provide the volume required to hear at the back of the room,  
or sound distribution systems wherein loudspeakers are placed at various points  
along the sides and back of the room. Very large spaces often require sound delay  
systems whereby, according to Cal Kennedy, CSEP, of Luminon Productions  
in Randburg, South Africa, “Sound is delayed by using second \(or more\) loud-  
speaker stacks so that the listener perceives to hear the same signal at the same  
time, no matter where one is within the venue. This is done to prevent an echo 202 Fundamentals of the Production  
or reverberation effect and help balance the overall audio perception on the ears.”  
The sound is delayed so that it is transmitted out of the distributed loudspeakers  
at the same time as the sound waves from the other loudspeakers on the stage  
would reach that part of an audience \(also allowing for lower decibel levels\).  
Loudspeakers project sound directionally, using woofers to produce the bass  
tones and tweeters to produce treble tones. Neil Fraser \(1989, 92\) notes, “Because  
our ears are on either side of our heads the brain is good at analyzing sound on the  
horizontal axis but not the vertical.” This has significant implications for the place-  
ment of loudspeakers for amplified sound and explains why loudspeaker stacks are  
often positioned at head level or a little higher and angled down when suspended  
from the ceiling—the sound designer needs to create overlapping pools of sound  
waves, just as the lighting designer creates overlapping pools of light beams.  
The loudspeakers are connected to the amplifiers and controlled by the mixer  
in a sound console. The console includes inputs and channels for all the various  
sound sources, uses an equalizer to manipulate the treble, bass, and volume \(and  
other effects\), and sends the signal to the appropriate output\(s\) \(including stage or  
ear monitors so performers are able to hear themselves\). The sound console might  
also include a recorder, CD or cassette player, headphones, and effects equipment.  
# Soundscaping  
Campbell \(1999, 129\) describes sound as an “audible atmosphere.” Soundscaping,  
or sound sculpting, is a composition of recorded and/or amplified audio that  
creates a particular mood with equipment positioned in various and specific  
areas within an event site. According to soundscape pioneer Robert Estrin,  
“Soundscaping came about because it is easier to trick the eye into believing  
what it is seeing if it is backed up by another sense. A few simple sounds at a  
moderate level reinforce a visual to create the illusion that the designer wants.”  
Sounds alone can conjure up anything in our imagination, from a steamy jun-  
gle to a stadium of roaring fans. Soundscaping might also be used to establish  
ambient noise suitable for a theme, such as running water, leaves rustling in a  
breeze, the snapping of twigs for a magical forest setting, or beeps, bleeps, and  
other electronic sounds for a spaceship interior.  
Audiovisual—Visual Support  
The other half of the audiovisual component is the visual support of the event,  
including anything from the humble flipchart to an extravagant multimedia  
spectacle including live and recorded video, photos, film, computer data, and  
much more. There are countless functional and artistic applications for the  
projection equipment and services available \(with new technology introduced Audiovisual—Visual Support  
203  
continually\), limited only by your creativity and the budget. Events can include  
live video of attendees enjoying the party or the RFID chip in their badge can  
trigger a personal on-screen welcome as they arrive. Their opinions and com-  
ments can be shown in real time via audience response systems or social media  
such as Twitter. Hybrid events combine the physical event and a virtual compo-  
nent, thereby increasing the audience or using text and embedded video post-  
event to increase its value and legacy. Speakers in distant locations can appear  
live and interact with other presenters and the audience via digital video or as  
holograms. High-definition projection is increasingly becoming the standard  
for décor solutions, using rapidly changing images to add energy and attendee-  
generated visuals to increase interactivity.  
Visual Projection  
Moran \(2007, 6\) points out, “Visual media is basically colored light,” so you  
must consider both the projection equipment and the surface\(s\) onto which  
the light is projected. Images from slides, overhead cells, computers, and video  
might be projected from the front onto opaque or glass-beaded screens, from  
the rear onto translucent screens, or through a closed-circuit television or  
data projection system into television or data monitors of practically any size.  
These can include video walls and large-scale video display equipment such  
as the Diamond Vision or JumboTron systems and outdoor video 8 mil light  
emitting diode \(LED\) screens; high-definition plasma or liquid crystal display  
\(LCD\) screens, which might be placed at specific points throughout an event  
space to ensure that the entire audience is able to see clearly; or even on large,  
clear TelePrompTer screens. There are inflatable screens, smoke screens, slot-  
ted screens through which a person may walk, and water screens that can be  
unlimited in height and width—flat, semicircular, cylindrical, fan-shaped, or  
with customized contours. You can project onto scrims, spandex shapes, a cur-  
tain of ribbons, balloons, balloon walls, ceilings, walls, floors, and even people  
\(especially those in fantastic costumes designed with expansive opaque exten-  
sions\). High-definition capabilities such as a digital light processing \(DLP\)  
projection and organic light emitting diode \(OLED\) screens should be consid-  
ered if using projection in a well-lit environment.  
Live video image magnification \(I-Mag\) can be used to project the current  
or concurrent action and should be considered particularly for groups of 200  
or more so that the audience may see the faces of those speaking and the action  
onstage. Cameras used to capture this action may be stationary, handheld, or  
boom operated. When using I-Mag, screens could be placed on either side of the  
stage when using two screens \(see Figure 7.4\); one screen positioned center stage,  
stage left, or stage right; four screens placed in a hollow square suspended from  
above in the middle of the audience; or dozens of screens placed throughout the 204

event space. Screens placed center stage must be positioned high enough so that  
a “feedback image” is not projected if the speaker walks in front of the screen.  
Note\: A person’s likeness is proprietary and you must secure permission to use  
that likeness in any product you will publish or offer for sale to the public after  
the event \(or, in some cases, publish via a Web site\), so you might wish to include  
such a permission agreement in your registration form and speaker or entertainer

INSIGHT |  
An expert in |-Mag video production for live presentations, Bob Johnson,  
of California-based VideoBob Robotic Systems, notes that some of the ben-  
efits of using fluid motion robotic cameras are the reduction of personnel  
requirements and the elimination of line-of-sight distractions to an audi-  
ence by a camera crew at a live performance. “Whereas a traditional camera  
setup would include a platform within the audience that could require an  
area equal to 12 seats or an entire table at a banquet, a robotic system uses  
a telescopic pole that takes up only one seat and there is no operator divert-  
ing the attention of the surrounding audience—and audiences are distracted  
by the camera operator moving about. I've even known of camera operators  
who have fallen asleep during a presentation and fallen off the platform. Now  
that’s distracting.” Johnson also notes that a robotic system allows you to  
place cameras where a camera operator cannot go. For a Microsoft company  
meeting, Johnson placed a robotic camera in the ceiling above the stage so  
he could focus on the computer keyboard Bill Gates was operating during the  
presentation \(www.videobob.com\). Audiovisual—Visual Support

Projection Specifications and Placement  
If projection is included in an event production, make certain that the proper equip-  
ment is used and sufficient space is allotted. Projectors for front screen projection  
can be placed within the audience or at the back of the room, or ona platform hung  
from the ceiling. Some venues have a projection booth for this purpose. Rear screen  
projection requires sufficient unobstructed space behind the screen to accommodate  
the throw \(distance\) required for the screen size. If the projector is not on a perpen-  
dicular plane with the screen \(e.g., ceiling-mounted\), you might have a keystone  
effect whereby the image becomes distorted in a trapezoidal manner; some projectors  
are able to adjust this internally, or the screen can be tilted slightly to compensate.  
You must always remember that the projector is throwing a beam of light and  
anything or anyone entering that beam will cast a shadow on the screen, so the  
projector and/or screen might have to be positioned above head height. This  
placement will have an impact on the room setup for front screen projection and  
the backstage area for rear screen projection \(a parade of waitstaff or technicians in  
black silhouette is probably not the image you planned\). The larger the image, the  
longer the throw required, and the longer the throw required, the more powerful  
the projection beam must be. The lighting will also affect the level of projection  
beam required; both lighting on the speakers or performers and keeping the house  
lights on can wash out the screen. Your AV provider or producer will work with  
you to select the appropriate type and power of projection system.  
Screen size and placement must also be considered from the perspective of sight  
lines, and as such affects and is affected by the seating configuration. Screens must  
be positioned so that they can be seen over the heads of the seated audience. Place  
screens a minimum of 5 ft \(1.5 m\) off the floor; place the first row of seats no closer  
than two times the vertical dimension of the screen; and place the last row of seats  
no farther than eight times the vertical dimension of the screen \(Krug 2000, 261\).  
Multimedia Considerations  
Multimedia presentations using numerous live and recorded video images, com-  
puter graphics, sound, lights, special effects, and live action are exciting, motivat-  
ing, and entertaining. They are, in fact, full-fledged theatrical productions and  
must be treated as such. The producer \(or technical director\) serves as the profes-  
sional coordinator for this portion of the overall event and must be included as a  
primary event team member throughout the design, planning, implementation,  
and evaluation phases of the event. The producer will work with the lighting,  
sound, audiovisual, set, and entertainment designers and providers to incorporate  
all their technical requirements into a seamless, integrated production.  
When using projection screens as the output for a variety of inputs \(computer  
graphics, prerecorded video, slides, film, and numerous cameras for live image 206 Fundamentals of the Production  
magnification\), a single person must direct when, where, and what camera feed is  
to be projected. Much of this is often predetermined within the script, but the per-  
son “calling the show” must have an excellent command of the desired order and  
impact in order to adjust directions according to what is actually happening. It is  
also important to remember that the more complex the production, the more com-  
plex the equipment will be, including numerous switches, interfaces, projection  
devices, and mixers \(audio and visual\), which is why that technical console looks  
as though it belongs in an aerospace command center just prior to a rocket launch.  
Special Effects  
Used in a variety of settings, ranging from haunted houses to product launches to  
sporting spectacles, special effects can direct attention, create emphasis, captivate,  
marvel, amuse, and add an element of surprise to an event. With the use of air, fire,  
water, paper, chemicals, and other earthly substances, you can create a fantastic array  
of out-of-this-world effects \(see Figure 7.5\). These attention getters and adrenaline  
triggers provide an emotional payoff that can leave an audience awestruck. They  
might be used to alter reality and establish identity or proclaim a message and  
express celebration. They are the punctuation marks in your event vocabulary.  
Timing for Emphasis and Excitement  
Special effects can add the emphasis needed to alert an audience to the important  
messages of an event production and contribute significantly to the excitement  
level. There might be a tendency to “overproduce” because you are enthralled by  
the possibilities, but unless you are trying to achieve a sensory overload, these  
effects must be used judiciously. Special effects should remain just that—special.

They must be incorporated into the production in just the right place and at just  
the right moment to achieve the goals and objectives of the event.  
Timing is everything. A butterfly release should take place when all the wed-  
ding guests are outside. Fog blasts in an entryway or onstage should startle the  
guests, not become expected. Pyrotechnic shows should build to an exciting cli-  
max, not go on and on with just more of the same. Confetti cannons should  
mark a high point, but not spew bits of paper onto everyone's dinner. And you  
must not release the doves just before your aerial fireworks display \(unless you are  
going for a falling roast dove effect\).  
Pyro—the Sky’s the Limit  
There is nothing that says “celebration” more than fireworks. Their light, sound,  
smell, and tangible excitement have added an emotional impact to celebrations  
since the Chinese first discovered gunpowder and Marco Polo brought their fire-  
works recipes from the East to Italy in the thirteenth century. They have been popu-  
lar climaxes for large outdoor civic events since the 1730s, when the first scheduled  
fireworks shows began in London’s pleasure gardens \(similar to today’s theme parks\).  
Pyrotechnics are an art and a science, as well as a potentially dangerous, even deadly,  
enterprise, yet it is partially that danger that makes them so exciting.  
Pyrotechnics may be included in events of all sizes in practically any location.  
Outdoor displays can range from simple set pieces to create a flaming logo or  
emblem, to a major computer-controlled orchestrated display, synchronized to  
live and/or recorded music, that shoots thousands of shells hundreds of feet into  
the sky at 300 miles per hour. Outdoor displays can range in cost from \$500  
to \$2,000 for burning logos, \$2,500 to \$5,000 for a small aerial display \(a few  
minutes long\), or \$1,000 to \$3,000 or more per minute for a choreographed  
spectacular. Aerial and outdoor displays have been used as finales for events rang-  
ing from civic festivals to wedding celebrations, to herald a new home run record  
at a baseball stadium, create a waterfall the entire length of a bridge to celebrate  
its centennial, and to mark the demolition of a high-rise hotel casino, as well as  
a spectacular entertainment feature at theme parks, resort properties, marketing  
events, and opening or closing ceremonies at sports events.  
Increasingly popular now are “indoor” or close-proximity pyrotechnics that use  
the same science of fire, combustion, and explosion with refinements that limit  
or eliminate the smoke and might be as close as 15 ft \(4.5 m\) to the audience for  
such effects as fountains, curtains, gerbs, line rockets, fireballs \(dragon’s cough\),  
flame projections, concussions \(salutes\), flash pots, stage mines, and sparkle pots.  
Modern pyrotechnicians are constantly developing new and exciting devices  
and applications that bring dazzling dimensions to corporate, cause-related, and  
conference events\: line rockets that whistle along cables from the back of the  
house to the stage to pinpoint an explosive reveal, or walls of fire that ignite upon 208  
Fundamentals of the Production  
the entrance of a star performer. Costs can range from \$1,000 to \$4,000, for  
simpler effects, up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for custom-made shows.  
The costs for both indoor and outdoor pyrotechnics include design, materials and  
equipment, generating the necessary paperwork, creating required floor plans,  
obtaining the appropriate permits, obtaining or verifying insurance, and work-  
ing with the event’s stage designer and its setup, cleanup, and on-site crews. Note\:  
Never attempt to operate pyrotechnic effects yourself.  
# ON-SITE  
# INSIGHT  
David L. Spear, CSEP, former president of New Orleans—based Classic Effects  
and 2002-2003 president of the International Special Events Society, advises  
that the pyro company ask four questions\:  
1. What are the audience demographics? \(“We can do loud, in-your-face  
effects or graceful, low-smoke effects.’\)  
2. What are the rooms like and what are their dimensions, including ceiling  
height and so forth?  
3. What other elements will you interact with, such as sound, lasers, or  
lighting?  
4. When does the pyro happen within the program?  
Spear also advises that you should never discuss indoor pyrotechnics in  
terms of duration; they are meant to accent and complement a program. “The  
professional event coordinator should ask himself, ‘What is the moment! want  
the audience to be moved to a higher emotional level?’ If | can take the people  
who are waiting to cheer when their team comes running onto the field, and  
with some quick gerbs, some concussion mortars, and mines in the team’s col-  
ors, and bring it up one notch higher for that audience, then I've done my job”  
Spear, whose company designed and produced the pyrotechnics for six  
Super Bowls, three Republican National Conventions, World Cup Soccer, and  
numerous national beauty pageants, also suggests that using pyrotechnics  
“with some flash and sparkle, some glitter, and a whistle” is an excellent way  
to open a show—to make sure the audience focuses its attention on the start  
of a program, because just turning down the lights or making an announce-  
ment \(“the voice of God”\) might not be sufficient. “Pyro may also be used  
during a speech wherein the speaker goes from one side of the stage and  
makes a point—flash—then to the other side of the stage for another point—  
flash—and it looks as though the speaker is setting off the pyro” Special Effects  
209  
Launching Instant Fun  
Confetti and streamers can be an alternative to close-proximity pyrotechnics,  
providing the same explosive sparkle without the fire. Using compressed air, air  
cannons can shoot out a burst of multicolored streamers up to 100 ft \(30m\)  
and large, colorful paper confetti or sparkling Mylar glitter in as much as a 40-ft  
\(12-m\) diameter, showering the audience with instant fun. \(Traditional glitter should  
never be used because of its material composition, very small size, and difficulty with  
removal during cleanup.\) Confetti comes in a variety of shapes and colors and can be  
die-cut in custom shapes \(the larger the piece, the longer it will float in the air—so  
bigger is better\). Streamers can be cut to length and customized with a company  
logo or a text message. There are also flame-treated streamers that can safely be  
mixed with pyrotechnic effects. Air cannons might be mounted onstage, on a truss,  
and/or hidden within the perimeter décor and can be detonated via remote control.  
Confetti blasters or geysers are also available, which propel a continuous flow  
of color and motion like a fountain or fire hose; some are handheld so that the  
direction can be controlled and adjusted physically by a technician. Handheld  
confetti sticks can be handed out or placed on tables so that guests can generate  
their own confetti shower. Air cannons can also be used to launch gifts into the  
air, such as T-shirts or coupons. You must be careful, however, about shooting \(or  
throwing\) anything into a group of people. Seminar speakers have been known to  
cause injuries and costly mishaps \(e.g., broken glasses, splashed coffee, etc.\) when  
they threw wrapped hard candy out into the audience in an attempt to add a bit  
of excitement to their presentations.  
Colorful balloons can serve not only as décor but also as a special effect. Balloon  
drops can signal the grand finale as they are released from nets in the ceiling to fall  
in a floating shower over the audience. A bag or net covering helium-filled bal-  
loons might be opened for a balloon release. However, because of environmental  
concerns, this practice may be strictly controlled outdoors \(and Mylar balloons  
are usually not permitted because they can interfere with power lines\). The effect  
might be achieved by securing long balloon strings to the ground so the balloons  
will float up but not escape. A balloon wall or large cylindrical column can serve  
as a colorful display until time for a reveal, then exploded to expose the product,  
person, or image behind it. Giant balloons filled with smaller balloons and con-  
fetti \(or even coupons\) might be rigged into the ceiling and detonated on cue via  
squibs to explode and release their shower of fun.  
Entertaining Effects  
Adding robotic or animated movement to the décor and production \(in addition  
to live entertainers\) may offer just the interactive special effects to take an event  
from the expected to the extraordinary. From three-dimensional animation in the 210  
Fundamentals of the Production  
form of holograms \(created with lasers\), to interactive digital avatars, to robotic  
movement controlled by remote operators and/or motion detectors—these sur-  
prising effects are sure to engage and entertain your guests. A popular interac-  
tive character is a robot, which can move around an event space, turn its head,  
and move its arms via remote control, operated by an individual \(with a small  
device within a shoulder bag\) acting as just another guest, or from a remote  
location if the robot is fitted with a small video camera. The robot and opera-  
tor each have a microphone and transmitter that allow the operator to hear and  
speak with the guests the robot encounters.  
Flying or floating performers, signs, and objects are aerial effects that can fill  
the space above the audience’s heads with as much entertainment value as that  
onstage. Aerial reader boards may be flown over an event site to deliver changing  
messages and graphics. Helium-filled balloons and spaceships with tiny motor-  
ized fans may be flown by remote control above the crowd, seeming to float  
magically in well-choreographed directions, and, as demonstrated at numerous  
opening and closing ceremonies at Olympic Games, the balloons may be illu-  
minated from within and support aerial gymnasts. In addition, people, props,  
and products may be flown via a rigging system similar to that used in theatrical  
productions to make Peter Pan fly.

Colja M. Dams, chief executive officer of VOK DAMS GRUPPE in Germany,  
turned the Volkswagen booth at the Geneva International Motor Show into  
the talk of the fair with “speaking cars.” Trade show visitors were astonished  
to find the eight vehicles representing the product lines on exhibition were  
brought to life when, upon entering the car, the visitor became engaged ina  
conversation with the car itself.  
The communication started out discretely and subtly. “The car wel-  
comed the guest, but the visitors soon realized that it was not simply a  
computer voice talking to them, because the vehicle reacted spontane-  
ously. It insisted on interaction and dialogue; 99 percent of the visitors  
played along and were engaged in a conversation with the product. No  
two dialogues were the same because the vehicles were brought to life by  
the voices of the actors, who skillfully responded to the individuals in the  
cars." \(Approximately 400 former radio hosts were cast to match tonality  
and voice to every single car, and were hooked up to the car's stereo sys-  
tem.\) Thus, the product information was tailored to the interests of each  
visitor and communicated in a highly individualized manner.

On a monitor belonging to the vehicle, messages could be blended in  
elegantly in the course of the conversation, further highlighting the technical  
features of the product. The interactive encounters, however, went much fur-  
ther than merely delivering technical information, as the automotive values  
of the Volkswagen brand were brought up in the conversations in a low-key,  
yet effective manner. Information and emotion were blended into a lasting  
and impressive experience. “The impact was intense. The production inside  
and around the product on the Volkswagen stand turned the mass experi-  
ence of the auto show into a highly personalized event. One couldn't help  
but notice the surprised and friendly faces of the people inside the cars. The  
concept worked because the product had been given a soul. Interactive art  
at its best.’

Making Magic—Serious Business  
The magic of special effects carries with it serious responsibilities. First and fore-  
most, everyone in the show needs to know. All the performers, technicians, installers,  
and operators must have a complete understanding of what effects will be used,  
exactly where they will be, exactly when they are to be executed, and how those  
effects are achieved. Those who need to know include any speakers and/or audience  
members who will be onstage while an effect is taking place, as well as the venue  
management \(who might be called on to adjust the smoke detection equipment in a  
function room so that the magical haze effect does not set off the sprinkler system\).  
The professional event coordinator \(as well as all others involved in the production\)  
must also understand that the professional operating the effect has complete author-  
ity to cancel or postpone it if conditions will compromise safety.  
For any effect used, make certain that a material safety data sheet \(MSDS\) is avail-  
able for reference. Appropriate hearing protection for noise must be provided for  
technicians operating or near explosive devices or loudspeakers. If black light is used,  
you must ensure that it is low in harmful ultraviolet radiation. Signs must be posted,  
advising the use of strobe effects. All projected substances must be nontoxic, and pref-  
erably biodegradable. Written procedures should be provided to all performers and  
workers for all flying effects. Make certain that a comfortable temperature is main-  
tained for the venue and that there is an adequate intake of clean outside air. And  
make certain that the appropriate fireproof curtains, props, sets, and costumes are  
used. Conduct the proper risk assessment so that the risks have been identified and  
dealt with \(see Chapter 12\). No special effect is worth a trip to the hospital \(or worse\). 212 Fundamentals of the Production  
Selecting Technical Providers  
An event production, whether simple or complex, requires special equipment and  
knowledgeable operators. The size of the technical production will depend on the  
scope and prioritized objectives for the event, but the professional event coordinator  
must always ensure that the budget spent is a sound investment by selecting the right  
professionals for the job. There are strategies for minimizing costs, such as select-  
ing local providers \(to reduce travel expenses\) and event-friendly venues \(those with  
sufficient power and rigging points, accessible loading docks, and generous dimen-  
sions\), but you might not have control over these choices. The venue might have been  
selected with other objectives in mind, or there might not be local providers for a par-  
ticular service. Some venues have exclusive contracts with technical providers or have  
their own in-house companies that must be used, and some organizations use and  
bring the same production company with them wherever their events are being held.  
Always Use Professionals  
Many of the technical services and special effects that have been discussed are  
potentially hazardous \(involving fire, electricity, and heavy equipment\), so, as  
a professional event coordinator, you should always use professionals for their  
installation and operation. Bob Estrin of Creative Event Technology contends  
that experience should be a key criterion for selection. “One-off, new, or annual—  
every event is a unique situation that requires the knowledge and eye of an expe-  
rienced professional.” Be certain to check a provider's qualifications. Ask for and  
check references. Check providers’ credentials and look at their previous work,  
particularly examples of productions similar to the production you require. Ask  
for evidence of any state, federal, local, or other requisite licenses or permits they  
must have to do business, as well as the appropriate insurance coverage, especially  
for pyrotechnics \(the insurance company should always be confirmed as a repu-  
table insurance provider by your insurance company\).  
For pyrotechnics in particular, David Spear suggests you ask the company for  
the MSDS forms for those effects you are considering. He also notes, “Some cit-  
ies and states are more sophisticated than others regarding licenses; some rely on  
national licensing processes and codes, while in others, you only work with the local  
fire department. Anywhere you go, and particularly in other countries, you should  
always contact the local authority having jurisdiction \(AHJ\), as specified in the  
National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\) codes.” Depending on the event, this  
can be one authority or can include the fire department, parks department, police  
department \(state and local\), transit authority, U.S. Coast Guard, and numerous  
other agencies. Spear suggests that this contact should be the responsibility of the  
provider, not the purchaser, and should be included in its scope of services provided. Selecting Technical Providers

Dorian J. Blagg, a 30-year audiovisual veteran and audiovisual presentations  
director for northern California-based DirectorAV, advises that if you and/or  
your clients are contemplating any meeting or event that might involve any  
audiovisual equipment such as stage lighting, self-standing or suspended  
screens, stage risers, audio equipment, etc., it would be advisable to obtain  
a copy of the venue's health and safety regulations, which will spell out what  
can or cannot be done on the premises. In addition, all reputable audiovisual  
production companies, rental service organizations, and “in-house” AV com-  
panies should also have written health and safety procedures and public  
liability insurance. Once again, you should obtain copies of these documents.  
During the setup phase of any event, you and your vendor should conduct  
regular safety inspections to make sure that all equipment is installed safely  
and securely. “Do not leave this to chance, or assume it has been taken care  
of!” Look for these potential! safety issues\:  
e Control cables are run safely and have been taped down or secured in  
“troughs.”  
e All power runs are installed correctly.  
e Any additional power drops are installed in compliance with regulations.  
e All lighting fixtures and fittings are correctly and safely attached \(with  
safety chains\), and lighting towers, trees, or truss units are safely  
installed and weighted down.  
e All loudspeakers are locked on their stands and attached to stable sup-  
port structures.  
e Stairs up to and down from the main stage are safe and structurally  
sound, and they are set flush with \(and bolted to\) the edge of the stage.  
e Allstage riser units are locked in position with no obvious gaps, tripping  
hazards and edges marked with stripped tape.

continues  
“on 214 Fundamentals of the Production  
e Standing and tabletop lecterns are provided with working reading lights,  
and power supplies are kept well away from water bottles or carafes.  
e All onstage equipment \(monitors, microphones, laptop computers,  
etc.\) is set safely.  
e Public entrances and exits are clear of any obstructions or tripping hazards.  
e Emergency exit doors are unlocked, the emergency lights work, and the  
evacuation signage is clearly visible.  
“Finally, only after you are satisfied, ask the venue, the vendor, and/or the  
fire marshal to conduct a final safety sweep. The vendor and the venue staff can  
then ‘sign off’ on the project. If there are any subsequent incidents, there will be  
a clear line of responsibility to follow up on. If they have to sign a safety declara-  
tion it will focus their minds more clearly, and make events safer for everyone.”  
Consolidate, Designate, and Communicate  
Depending on the type, style, scope, and location of your event and its produc-  
tion, you could be working with numerous providers for each individual product  
and/or service, or you might wish to procure the services of a technical produc-  
tion company to handle this portion of your event. Bob Estrin advises that you  
either hire or designate a technical director to oversee the integration of all the  
various production elements and their respective needs. The more complex the  
production, the more complicated this integration of equipment, staff, installa-  
tion requirements, and operations will be, and a technical director will be able to  
choreograph, navigate, and negotiate this effort more efficiently and safely.  
Just as everyone involved needs to be knowledgeable about any special effects  
that are used, so too do all involved with the show need to know the extent and the  
content of the show, the lighting angles, the audio positions, the video screens,  
the special effects, the sight lines, the rigging points, the table layout, the food  
service, and the entertainment. Estria notes, “There is nothing so special that it  
can’t be told to all the vendors or providers. There is no reason to withhold infor-  
mation.” You might need to secure confidentiality agreements from all participat-  
ing providers, but they must all be included in the production planning process.  
Site Considerations  
Technical productions take space, often lots of space, to accommodate the equip-  
ment, the effects, and the technicians and operators of that equipment and those Wrap Up  
215  
effects. The professional event coordinator and/or the producer/technical director  
must work together to incorporate the requisite spatial and proximity needs of each  
type of equipment and operator into the overall layout of the floor or site plan. Both  
aerial and close-proximity pyrotechnics will require specific easements according to  
the effects produced. Lighting angles and plot designs will be based on the lighting  
effects and illumination required within the space and production program. Power  
will have to be distributed properly so that all involved have the electricity they  
need without overloading the capabilities of the power sources. The tech booth,  
platforms, and/or trailer must be positioned for optimal operational effectiveness.  
Time—Schedule the Logistics  
Technical productions also take time, which increases exponentially as the lighting,  
sound, and projection increases in complexity. Limited hours for setup and difficult  
\(or blocked\) loading dock access are the factors that cause most problems—and  
the potential for cost overruns. In addition, inexperienced producers or indi-  
vidual vendors can cause costly delays. Sufficient and appropriately scheduled  
time for installation, equipment testing, and rehearsals must be included in the  
production schedule.  
Equipment must be rigged and checked, entertainers must be allowed to check  
their performance areas and apparatus, special effects must be tested and secured,  
and the actions and agenda must be rehearsed. And, as in the theater, everyone  
needs a little quiet time prior to the show itself to mentally prepare for the per-  
formance to come, because once the production begins, everyone must be com-  
pletely focused on what he or she needs to do to make it the best show possible.  
There is only one chance to get it right.  
Wrap Up  
The professional event coordinator has an astounding number of theatrical and  
technical options available to bring sophisticated and exciting production values  
to any event of any size in virtually any location. Similar to those created for and  
found in other entertainment media, these theatrical tricks, tools, and techniques  
might be used to enhance the communication and celebration objectives of an  
event, but should be employed only when it suits the purpose of the event, not  
just because they are possible. Like any other element of an event, these elements  
should be invested in only to further the goals and objectives of the event.  
Lighting and sound augmentation and projection systems enhance the event  
environment by providing the illumination and amplification that allow the audi-  
ence to see and hear the elements of the event. They can also be used to move the  
event experience along its carefully crafted progression. Audiovisual technology and 216 Fundamentals of the Production  
multimedia productions allow the professional event coordinator to communicate  
the purpose and important messages intended by presenting them via diverse learn-  
ing dimensions, as required by modern audiences. Special effects—ranging from the  
humble balloon drop to the explosive power of pyrotechnics to interactions with  
robotic entertainment or the instant abandon of dancing inflatables and showers of  
confettimaccentuate and punctuate the message and purpose of an event at just the  
right time and place to move the audience to an emotionally satisfying moment.  
Although the professional event coordinator is not expected to be an expert  
production designer, producer, or technician, he or she is expected to be familiar  
enough with these technologies to be an expert buyer. This requires bringing the  
right people and providers onto the event team so that these potentially hazardous  
elements are integrated seamlessly and safely into the overall event planning and  
production. Clear communication is paramount, so that everyone in the show will  
know exactly what is expected and how to deliver the best show possible.

EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Outline and describe the lighting, sound, multimedia, and special effects you would  
employ for the following events. Explain how these will enhance the fulfillment of  
the event's goals and objectives.  
A. A regional shopping mall has been undergoing extensive renovations,  
which are now complete, and the owners have hired you to coordinate an  
exciting entertainment extravaganza to celebrate their grand reopening in  
conjunction with a special“Midnight Madness Sale” promotion. They want to  
highlight the new improvements and décor. They need an exciting way  
to introduce the 20 new upscale retail tenants, as well as promote their old Wrap Up  
217  
tenants, and they want to dazzle both the media and the thousands of shop-  
pers at this late-night event.  
- You have been contracted by a large software company to coordinate its  
reception at an annual computer electronics trade show at which the com-  
pany will be unveiling and explaining its latest voice recognition software.  
It needs to make sure that the guests, composed of trade media and buy-  
ers from major retailers, understand the complexities of this product and its  
broad range of applications, from the consumer market \(home and small  
business user\) to the interactive entertainment industry.  
. Your city has been selected to be the site for a national beauty pageant, with  
the final judging event to be televised on a major network, and you have been  
selected to coordinate the two-night production. There will be 50 contestants  
included in a talent and a swimsuit competition before a live audience on the  
first night, highlights of which will be replayed on the second night while  
the judges are conferring. The final judging on the second night will consist  
of a ball-gown competition to select five finalists. The five finalists will then  
be judged based on their responses during onstage interviews, and the win-  
ner will be announced and crowned in a grand finale. The sponsors want this  
to be an emotional and entertaining experience for both the live audience  
and the television viewers.

In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
@ Develop the structure of an effective and progressive event experience.  
e Organize the entertainment components of an engaging experience  
to achieve the purpose, goals, and objectives for an event.  
e Determine the options for entertainment and attractions for an event  
experience and ensure their suitability for the event specifications and  
audience.  
e Identify and procure the speakers and entertainment products,  
performers, and services to enhance the purpose and theme of an  
event experience within the budgetary resources for the event.  
e Coordinate performers’ needs, integrate the logistics into the event  
plan, monitor the performance delivery, and evaluate the effectiveness  
of the entertainment elements of the event experience. 221 n outlining the type and scope of entertainment activities for a large company party, the  
event coordinator had strongly recommended the inclusion of three caricaturists instead  
of the one the committee had planned. Her reasoning was that this would be a very popu-  
lar activity, providing a memento many of the attendees would wish to have, and that one  
caricaturist would simply not be able to handle the volume of guests expected during the  
\_ function. This advice was not taken and, as predicted, at the party the caricaturist had such  
2 a tong line of people waiting that those in the queue started to get frustrated and angry.  
\: ‘The mood became so antagonistic that the event coordinator had to close the caricatur-  
i 1's booth and have security escort him out of the event. When asked by the head of the  
“party committee why she had removed the caricaturist, the event coordinator explained  
that the situation had changed from an amusing activity to an unsafe condition, adding,  
— "You wanted him to entertain your guests, not inflame them.  
ee ee We ee ee ee a ee ee ee ee ee ee ee  
Entertainment is that which commands and holds attention, pleasantly diverts,  
or amuses. Edutainment brings the showmanship and production values of enter-  
tainment attractions into the learning process with the inclusion of music, humor,  
activities, and, most importantly, interaction. Entertainment in some form is  
included in virtually all events, primarily to enhance the event experience. Even the  
most solemn of occasions often utilize music and ritual performances to reinforce  
the significance of the event. Entertainment, including entertainers, speakers, and  
other presenters, can be used to reinforce a theme or mood, link event program  
components, enhance the environment, direct traffic flow, encourage interaction,  
deliver a message, capture attention, and increase attendance. These attractions  
and elements can amuse, arouse, and educate us. They can help us to celebrate or  
commemorate important points of our life, enjoy the world around us, or allow  
us to escape our everyday life. They support our rituals and ceremonies, energize  
our gatherings, and fill our leisure pursuits with fun and frolic.  
Although frivolity might be the objective, selecting and procuring the right  
entertainment and performers for an event must not be frivolous. The entertain-  
ment provided must be suitable for the event and the event audience. It must be  
chosen with care to enhance the event’s purpose and adhere to its budget, and  
it must be incorporated into the site and agenda to facilitate the proceedings.  
This involves structure and discipline—not simply picking the performers and  
entertainment you happen to like. Event Choreography  
223  
Event Choreography  
An event experience must be choreographed and blocked out as carefully as any  
dance, play, or film. The professional event coordinator crafts a plan that takes the  
attendee or guest through a structured progression of various sights, sounds, tastes,  
textures, smells, highs, lows, climaxes, diversions, and discoveries that delivers the  
intended impact and message of the event. This plan needs to incorporate the event  
legibility factors discussed in Chapter 6, including behavioral cognition and the  
principles of dramaturgy\: structure \(plot\), direction \(procedures\), time \(agenda\),  
space \(atmosphere\), and action \(movement\).  
Constructing the Experience  
Constructing or engineering an engaging event experience is similar to writing a  
play or screenplay. You start with the premise and plot \(the purpose\), determine  
the finale \(the intended outcome\), assemble the components, define the char-  
acters and their motives, and arrange the action so that it takes the individual  
\(viewer or visitor\) to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Berridge \(2007,  
239\) refers to experience construction as a process that encompasses taking the  
empty space to be used and filling it with activities, interactions, and the func-  
tional elements that support them, resulting in the experiential flow. This flow,  
Berridge advises, requires “thinking about the way an event unfolds through a  
series of linked sequences.” Pine and Gilmore \(1999, 61\) note, “Many times,  
experienced stagers develop a list of impressions they wish guests to take away  
and then think creatively about different themes and story lines that will bring  
the impressions together in one cohesive narrative.”  
Although you are not writing a play, the dynamics are the same, and the three  
acts are the same\: \(1\) premise, \(2\) rising action, \(3\) climax. This progression  
from opening to finale is composed of scenes, and each scene must move the  
story forward. You can use various content or entertainment options to create or  
accompany each scene. For example, an educational conference might open with  
a plenary session featuring an industry leader speaking on the state of the industry,  
followed by numerous concurrent learning sessions and discussions using peer  
educators, and finishing with a motivational keynote speaker.  
For a festival in which the experience is self-directed, you might use different  
entertainment styles in different areas to draw visitors to a variety of locations. For a  
choreographed program, such as a theme party or awards ceremony, entertainment  
should be scheduled to move the “show” along at the appropriate pace and progres-  
sion, perhaps by having costumed greeters at the entrance, acoustic music during  
the cocktail hour while guests are mingling and talking, a cirque-style gymnastic  
performance or the awards presentation during dinner, and an interactive band  
for after-dinner dancing, closing with a final production number incorporating an  
indoor pyrotechnical display. 224

Staging an Engaging Experience  
Dimension, Diversity, and Diversion  
The inclusion of entertainment gives added\: dimension to the event experience,  
including diversity and depth, as well as diversions that make the experience more  
meaningful and enriching. Various forms of entertainment might help to develop  
the “characters of the play” \(components of the event program\) and the subplots that  
add a deeper meaning to the climax. For example, using performance artists—such  
as a painter to paint the portrait of the recipient on a giant canvas to announce an  
award winner or ice sculptors with chain saws to sculpt the martini bar before the  
guests’ eyes—can turn the practical aspects of the event into memorable experiences.  
Heraldic horns or Japanese taiko drummers might imbue an opening with cultural  
significance, and a Native American Friendship Circle Dance might conclude a  
program with deep communal significance.  
Strolling and static performers \(from operatic singers to juggling jesters, or cow-  
boy fiddlers to gypsy violinists\) can enhance the theme environment, and marching  
or moving groups \(marching bands, drum corps, mariachis, or gospel choirs\) might  
lead guests from one area to another. Celebrities and nationally known headliner  
acts can add value to attending an event, and celebrity look-alikes can add depth to a  
theme. Indigenous entertainment might provide the authentic experience visitors  
seek, and interactive games could provide the energy release attendees require.  
You should consider entertainment options for every dimension of the event  
experience and every aspect of the event environment.  
When no ordinary groundbreaking would do, Mary Tribble, CSEP, and Tribble  
Creative Group of Charlotte, North Carolina, created an earth-shattering  
event. After a VIP breakfast reception, guests walked across the street to a tent  
surrounded with colorful tubular balloons. Behind the tent, six earthmovers  
stood at attention, two holding up a welcome banner. Inside the tent, in  
front of a festive backdrop, a mound of dirt held several ceremonial shovels  
awaiting what the guests believed to be a traditional groundbreaking.  
After the appropriate speeches, the dignitaries approached the shovels for  
the final ceremony. The action was stopped, however, by an actor playing a  
construction worker, saying, “You all have to get out of here! We're about to  
blow this place!” He unveiled an oversized TNT plunger and then encouraged  
the company’s VIPs to gather around. When they plunged the handle, it cued  
a large explosion of confetti canons, which signaled the beginning of the  
theme song “I Feel the Earth Move,’ by Carol King. Scripting the Program 225  
Guests turned around as they heard the rumble of the heavy equipment,  
which was driven to either side of the tent. The operators \(rehearsed by the  
management company the day before\) began a series of highly choreographed  
moves, including whirling and twirling by the smaller skid-steers and synchro-  
nized “Motown” moves by the dozers and excavators. At the end of their’“dance”  
the bulldozers returned to the starting points and “bowed” to the audience,  
who cheered in appreciation of a most unique use of rental equipment.

Scripting the Program  
Just as the professional event coordinator constructs an event experience as a play-  
wright structures a play, the event should also be scripted like a play. The profes-  
sional event coordinator should write a script, running order, agenda, or detailed  
description for the event, including the activities, timing, setting, and, if neces-  
sary, even the dialogue. Like the scenes in a play, the event program elements are  
put in their proper sequence to build to the appropriate climax, paced according  
to the type and scope of the event and the needs of the event audience, and staged  
according to sound dramatic principles including builds, respites, focus, and flow.  
Such a script allows the event coordinator to envision the event experience from  
start to finish to ensure that it meets the goals and objectives \(the desired outcomes\)  
in an effective and engaging manner.  
Arrange the Agenda  
With the desired outcomes established and the program elements identified, you  
must put the scenes in their proper order to achieve a strong opening, eloquent  
body, and meaningful climax. This order, like all facets of professional event coordi-  
nation, is based on the logical and necessary movement from one item to the next,  
and specifies the “sequence, progression, and duration” \(Pine and Gilmore 1999,  
105\). Religious ceremonies might have a specific order of ritual action. Civic or  
government events might have a specific protocol that must be followed. Product  
launches could have specific units of information to be dispersed in between enter-  
tainment acts. Festivals and fairs might have a historic precedence for scheduling  
certain elements. Training programs might have a requisite progression of content  
modules based on learning dynamics. Fashion shows could have segments based on  
seasonal collections or a hierarchy of celebrity models. 226  
Staging an Engaging Experience  
Take the outline of entertainment elements or agenda items and, in collabora-  
tion with the appropriate stakeholders, put them in a sequential linear order. This  
is when you should consider—and question—the sequence. Would a different  
order better meet the needs of the event? Perhaps it would be better to hold the  
wedding reception first and conclude with the ceremony at midnight. Maybe a  
further measure of pomp and pageantry should be added at certain points during  
a government event. Does the product launch agenda offer the right opportunities  
for media coverage? Is it possible that the historic schedule of events at the festival  
has become stale? Will adding energy breaks to the training agenda improve per-  
formance? Does the fashion show lineup allot sufficient time for quick changes?  
And does the event build to an emotionally satisfying finale?  
\~  
Control the Content  
In the film genre \(as well as theatrical and literary genre\), editing is the key to  
success—taking the scenes and action filmed, selecting those scenes that are most  
important to the story, and putting them in the best order to tell the story in the  
most effective and economic manner. You must select the most important elements,  
eliminate those that do not support the program or production, and condense the  
action and activity into a tight and effective presentation that delivers a “cohesive  
narrative,” the desired event experience.  
Such editing might involve some hard choices and assertive directions. You  
might need to cut the children’s choir performance from two songs to one.  
You might need to move the instructional video from within the program  
to a looped presentation displayed as an exhibit. You might need to edit ten  
content points down to three. You might have to restrict a speech to three  
minutes instead of the ten minutes the speaker wanted. You could decide to  
use a videotaped message instead of a live speech. You might have to instruct  
the orchestra to simply start playing during an acceptance speech that is going  
on too long. This is why it is so important to create the script early enough  
that you are able to make these decisions before presenters, performers, and  
others have been promised something that should not \(and ultimately will  
not\) be included in the final production.  
When specific rites, rituals, and other protocols are required, it is imperative to  
consult with the appropriate religious and/or organizational officials to deter-  
mine your options. When specific learning objectives are expected, you must  
consult with those resources that provide expert advice on adult learning dynam-  
ics. And when specific marketing and/or branding objectives must be met, you  
must consult with the marketing experts to define and refine your options. The  
overall objective is to put on a good “show,” an engaging experience that meets  
and exceeds expectations. Scripting the Program  
227  
Pace the Program  
Good dramatic structure demands excellent timing. Punch lines should not be  
delivered too early. Critical information must not be delivered too late. Openings  
should not be soft, and climaxes should not be anticlimactic. Reveals and discover-  
ies should have an element of surprise. The audience should always be hungry for  
the answers, and those answers must be satisfying. This might all be controlled  
with pacing—controlling the speed and complexity with which the experience is  
delivered. There must be a balance of stimuli and rest, content and cogitation, and  
emotional highs and reprieves. The program must be designed to flow toward the  
climax with builds, highlights, respites, focal points, and, as with the printed page  
or lighting design, some “white space” that allows the audience to pace their intake  
\(and share the experience with each other\). Just as with special effects, you want the  
body of the show to flow beautifully, highlighted with effective punctuation marks.  
A master of ceremonies \(MC, or emcee\) is often employed to provide an audience  
with an anchor personality and keep the action moving at the appropriate pace.  
A script might have to be written for an emcee so he or she is able to recognize  
important people in the audience and announce important information. Any  
notes or scripts prepared by or for an emcee should be scanned to ensure that they  
do not include any “in jokes” that might not be understood by portions of the  
audience, nor any introductory or biographical comments \(or ad libs\) that would  
be inappropriate or embarrassing to the person being introduced. The master of  
ceremonies originated in the eighteenth century with the position of toastmaster,  
whose ceremonial clothes included the red tailcoat—the costume still worn by the  
ringmaster at circuses around the world \(signifying the individual who announces  
the acts and “controls the circus”\).  
It’s Show Time  
Once you have the script developed, review it with your production team to ensure  
that it is technically feasible. Review it with all the necessary performers and stake-  
holders to make certain it is understood and agreed to. Again, everyone in the show  
needs to know, from the production technicians and performers to the photographer,  
makeup artists, media personnel, and others. The performers need to know so they  
will be mentally and physically prepared to enter on cue and deliver outstanding  
performances. The event photographer or videographer needs to know so he or she  
can get the best shots and those that will be most important to the client or host. The  
costume, hair, and makeup professionals need to know so they can be prepared for  
touch-ups and quick changes. Members of the media need to know so they will get  
the story they need and provide the coverage you want. For example, if an address  
by a dignitary is to be presented via videotape instead of live, you might arrange for  
the media to receive copies of the videotape that they can incorporate into their 228  
Staging an Engaging Experience  
broadcasts instead of reporting that your event was not important enough to  
merit an in-person appearance by that dignitary.  
Your final script could be prepared in various formats, depending on the type  
and scope of the production. You might want a simple agenda for participants  
and media and a complete script, including the full text of the speeches, for the  
technicians, stage managers, and particularly those calling the cues for the show.  
A separate script might be needed that includes just the text for those speeches  
to be displayed on TelePrompTers or confidence monitors. Stage assistants might  
need a script to ensure that certain presenters make their way from their dinner  
tables to their places backstage in time for their entrances. The caterer might need  
one so that the dessert parade scheduled to occur between two segments of the  
awards presentation happens right on time. Everyone in the show needs to know.

Marketing and events consultant Jean McFaddin, owner of New York City-  
based Jean McFaddin Associates, is known as the “The Parade Lady” due to her  
25-year tenure as Macy’s East senior vice president in charge of public relations  
and events, which included producing and directing the award-winning Macy's  
Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1977 through 2001. In addition to receiving  
12 Emmy Awards with NBC for the annual parade, as well as countless other  
accolades, McFaddin has been inducted into both the International Festivals  
and Events Association Hall of Fame and the Event Solutions Hall of Fame.  
lt has been said that McFaddin took a dinosaur and turned it into a multi-  
dimensional spectacular during her tenure as the parade’s producer. When  
asked what were some of the changes she made, or that occurred, over the  
years to achieve this transformation, she offered the following.  
“While | had many demanding goals in revitalizing Macy's Parade, my first  
priority was to enhance the entertainment value, creating a bigger event  
that would fill the street and sky at every level with color and spectacle. |  
knew that by making a visually dynamic and exciting entertainment show,  
we would attract more media and greater audiences, whereby top-notch  
entertainment partners and sponsor dollars would follow. These entertain-  
ment enhancements and partners would require challenging and demand-  
ing changes in existing production standards, but they would also enable  
me to establish a strong marketing program, which was equally necessary to  
the parade if it was to be ‘state of the art’  
“To begin, | identified and built upon those elements that were unique  
to Macy’s Parade, like the giant balloons that were ‘signatures’ of the parade. Scripting the Program  
# SN  
When | arrived there were only a total of eight or nine balloons seen per  
parade. By revamping our balloon operations and in building the right part-  
ners, we increased the balloons to a total of 45 to 60 flying in each parade,  
introducing varying new sizes and purpose to the sky. This includes beloved  
cartoon heroes and new children’s celebrity characters \(giant balloons like  
Spiderman and Big Bird\), plus new, smaller decorative novelty balloons  
\(like Ice Cream cones and Macy’s Stars\) and the new recreations of mid-sized  
historic balloons \(like Harold the Fireman and the Elf balloons\) to reinforce  
the tradition of the parade.  
“As a result of this balloon expansion, we added thousands of trained cos-  
tumed balloon handlers in the parade. To my happy surprise, this enhance-  
ment in the balloon program increased the visual impact of the event both on  
the street and in the sky. It was a ‘two for one’ benefit! Plus, by expanding the  
balloon inflation to happen the day before the parade, we made it an ‘event in  
itself’ which annually attracts thousands of people and world media.  
“In addition to the enhanced balloon program, | incorporated fully staged,  
choreographed production numbers with celebrity stars on and around  
many floats throughout the parade. NBC agreed to make the first hour of the  
parade telecast live coverage instead of a studio show. This enabled us to add  
a spectacular opening for the parade as well as to present the exciting arrival  
of the Parade in Herald Square. Also, we added live production numbers from  
Broadway's hottest musical show, which benefited Broadway and New York  
City tourism as well as enhanced the parade. Equally important, | generated  
more ground-level excitement in the parade by adding large oversized per-  
formance groups to maximize visual performance entertainment. This gives  
a terrific wow! factor, in which the audience gets a giant surge of theatrical  
energy! We accomplished these mass performances by working with creative  
youth resources to recruit and unite young people from local organizations  
throughout the country \(example\: a group of 800 cheerleaders or a group of  
a 1,000 singers\). These enthusiastic young performers were brought together  
in NYC a few days before the parade to be staged in dynamic thematic routines,  
created just for Macy’s Parade.  
“While the balloon and inclusion of larger production numbers were giant  
steps, smaller changes were equally crucial. For example, my favorite change  
was to make sure that Santa’s appearance and presentation were enriched  
and distinctive to Macy's Parade \(i.e., his suit, his float, his arrival into Herald  
Square on NBC\). After all, we all know that he is the ‘real Santa’ thanks to the  
movie, The Miracle on 34" Street, don't we!

“While there were too many revisions to discuss here, the objective was  
the same—to create a great show, bigger and better than the year before.  
We achieved this goal annually and established a new benchmark for the  
industry. They say the best compliment is imitation and | am surprised and  
pleased that many of these staging concepts have been adopted by sister  
parades throughout America. Remember\: If the show is spectacular, success  
will follow.”

Many events use speakers, presenters, and other “content delivery” specialists.  
These professionals might include an emcee to manage the pace of a social event,  
an auctioneer to run the bidding at a charity auction, or an announcer or com-  
mentator to provide play-by-play descriptions and interesting facts and figures  
at a sports event. A celebrity spokesperson might be used at a product launch  
or a dignitary might be invited to give a short presentation at a ribbon-cutting or  
dedication ceremony. A media personality \(or industry luminary\) might serve as a  
talk-show-style moderator to facilitate a panel discussion or question and answer  
\(Q & A\) session at a conference or exhibition. Subject matter experts \(SMEs\)  
and peer educators—working practitioners in a specific field—are often used in  
educational programs.  
These speakers or presenters are performers, just as in any other type of entertain-  
ment. Some are natural-born performers and some have honed their presentation  
skills for years. They are \(or should be\) comfortable on stage, able to interact with  
their audience and deliver the content expected. That content is based on the  
communication objectives and educational obligations of the event. The delivery  
of that content can be done in a variety of formats and delivery systems. However,  
the personality of the presenter, and his or her ability to engage the audience, will often  
be the measure of success.  
Choosing Topics and Formats  
Topics or the messages to be communicated are developed based on the purpose  
and objectives of the event, and must consider the needs and interests of the  
event audience. The scope and substance of the content for an event could be Selecting and Booking Speakers and Presenters  
231  
developed using a single internal or external decision maker, a program com-  
mittee, or crowd-sourcing techniques such as social media, wikis, and other  
Web-based collaboration tools. Some conventions and conferences broadcast an  
open call for presentations on the event’s Web site and see what topics come  
in, Others analyze industry trends and issue a call for session abstracts within  
a list of specific topics that will be considered. Relevant deliverables—what the  
attendee should be able to do with the information delivered—should be devised  
in conjunction with the content scope and subject matter requirements, especially  
events with predetermined content requirements. These deliverables should be  
used when sourcing, evaluating, and contracting speakers and presenters.  
Content delivery formats vary widely \(see Figure 8.1\), ranging from highly  
structured to fluid and flexible, and delivery systems can be face-to-face or Web-  
based, synchronous or asynchronous, verbal and/or visual, and spectator or par-  
ticipatory. For example, game shows are popular formats for testing retention of  
product information or content points. Talk show-style presentations add dimen-  
sion to a panel discussion. Case studies might be presented by actors, filmed or live,  
and could be used to stimulate discussion about controversial or complex topics.  
Interactive exhibits, games, and simulators might be designed or programmed to  
deliver key messages or to develop manual skills. Social media can be incorporated  
by displaying attendee-generated comments and questions real-time on projec-  
tion screens, often called a backchannel. The format selected will have logistical  
impacts in terms of room setup and equipment needs, and will be based on the  
presenter’s abilities and comfort-level with that format. Whatever format selected  
should incorporate some form of audience interaction that facilitates conversation  
about the content.

Finding and Securing the Right Fit  
Finding the right speaker or presenter \(and as discussed next, entertainers\) depends  
on matching the presenter to the event content and objectives. Big name \(and high-  
priced\) professional speakers are often sought for keynote sessions or presentations  
in order to attract larger audiences and generate greater ticket sales or registrations.  
Yet increased attendance revenue might not be the only objective; it might be to  
enhance the image of the organization and thereby increase the size of donations,  
reshape/increase the “target markets” for the organization's programs, or increase  
the “validity” of the organization and its message.  
Some events use Open Space \(www.openspaceworld.org\), BarCamp \(http\://  
barcamp.org/\), or other Unconference \(www.unconference.net\) program styles  
in which topics are user-generated and presented by the attendees on-site \(Hogg  
2010\). Professional development programs and conferences often solicit peer edu-  
cators as presenters, often offering only a complimentary registration as compensa-  
tion. Conventions that include trade shows and educational sessions often allow  
exhibitors to serve as peer educators as well. Corporate events often have the CEO  
or other company executives as speakers. Although many of these “free” speakers  
are very engaging, effective, and well-received, some can be, as David Lutz, CMP  
notes, “dry as toast” script- or PowerPoint-readers or use “the opportunity to deliver  
a sales pitch.” Lutz, managing director of Velvet Chainsaw Consulting, advises that  
speaker coaching should be provided for inexperienced presenters, which could  
include conference calls, Webinars, or one-on-one coaching \(particularly for inex-  
perienced company executives\). “Meeting participants learn more when the session  
is interactive and where speakers are able to leverage the collective wisdom of all of  
the participants.”  
Written contracts or engagement agreements should be generated for all speak-  
ers or presenters \(except for those in-house company executives\), which should set  
expectations and meet the needs of both performer and client. Lutz advises that  
these agreements should specify dates, times, location, subject matter, room setup  
and AV requirements \(and charges as appropriate\), expectations and deadlines for  
documents \(e.g., session descriptions, handouts, bios and photos, etc.\), policies  
and procedures \(e.g., communications, reimbursements, do’s and don'ts, cancella-  
tion, etc.\), and compensation \(e.g., fee or honorarium, free registration or exhibit  
booth, housing accommodations, etc.\). Lutz notes, “More and more, speakers are  
being asked to extend the reach of their live presentation by writing blog posts  
in advance or performing pre- or postevent Webinars to extend or reinforce the  
learning.” Many events use an automated \(often Web-based\) speaker management  
system that manages speaker details; presentation proposal, review, and acceptance  
communications; collection of presentation materials; the scheduling of the pre-  
sentations into sessions; and generation of post-event data and analytical reports

Andrea H. Gold, president of Tucson, Arizona-based Gold Stars Speakers  
Bureau, has a great deal of experience in booking top-name speakers for  
meetings and conventions, yet has run into an occasional challenge or two.  
She advises that “a level of trust is required in the vendors and suppliers with  
whom you work, and you usually have choices with whom you wish to work”  
When contracting speakers, some are exclusive \(a single agent or agency  
represents the speaker\) and some are nonexclusive, meaning you can book  
your speaker through any favorite trusted agency or bureau, or with the  
speaker directly. Gold notes that even if a specific speaker is exclusive “in  
most cases, it is important that you know that—even with most exclusive  
speakers—you still have a choice of working with your favored speakers  
bureau or supplier. Some agencies will give you the impression that you can  
book their speakers only through them. This is rarely the case. If not sure,  
ask your favorite supplier first.”  
She had a long-time client who wanted a specific six-figure nonexclusive  
celebrity speaker for an international event. The client's meeting planner called  
the speaker's office directly to check date availability. The speaker's assistant,  
who handled the speaker's calendar, told the planner that the speaker had to  
be booked through a certain agency that he had picked. “It was highly irregu-  
lar. The client was unhappy, as it did not wish to work through some unknown  
supplier \(a bureau in Europe in this case\), and was very clear that it wanted to  
book this speaker through my company”  
What are the implications here? “First, the client has a right to choose  
a trusted supplier. Second, it’s a red flag when the assistant wants to refer  
business to a third party when the speaker wasn’t even exclusive with that  
third party. It seemed to hint at monetary or other favors of one form or  
another between those two parties, possibly at the expense of the client.  
Third, there was a very good chance that the speaker himself had no clue  
about this situation. The speaker was poorly represented by his assistant.  
This was a famous business thought leader, and his office did not display  
proper ethics and professionalism.”  
It was a delicate balance to communicate on behalf of the client and still keep  
goodwill with the speaker's office. The speaker's assistant was adamant about  
his position at first. In the end, the client's interests were honored and Gold Stars  
Speakers Bureau managed the client’s interests while working with the speak-  
er’s assistant on the international event. “This was a very unusual situation, but  
underlines that you, as a representative of the client, do usually have choices.’

Selecting and Booking  
# Entertainment  
Entertainment can be passive, interactive, decorative, instructional, interpretive,  
inspirational, musical, verbal, visual, ritual, and/or culturally indigenous. To select  
and book the best entertainment for an event, you must define the specific goals and  
objectives for the inclusion of entertainment and the conditions and restrictions for  
booking entertainment and attractions. Although your options are virtually endless, as  
illustrated in the Activity Elements Checklist in Chapter 1 \(Figure 1.8\) and the enter-  
tainment listed in Figure 8.2 \(which is by no means complete\), the budget rarely is. In  
addition, your local or regional sources for providers or performers might be limited.  
The event space and/or the timeline might also be limited. The acts or performers you  
want might not be available. You must make the best choices, based on the resources  
available, and execute the proper contracts with the entertainers you have selected. You  
must then make certain that all the contractual specifications, including the entertain-  
ers contract riders, are incorporated into your event plan. Finally, you must monitor  
and assess the value and effectiveness of the entertainment elements for the event.  
Assess Needs and Resources  
Entertainment must support the purpose and objectives of the event. This might  
include adding excitement, enhancing the flow and pacing of the event experience,  
expressing appreciation to the audience or guests, focusing attention on important  
images and messages, and/or invigorating and motivating the attendees. You might  
wish to facilitate interaction, create a mood, or simply encourage play. Dan Nelson,  
CSEP, CMP, of Dan Nelson Productions in Las Vegas, Nevada, notes that many  
special events “can benefit from entertainment vignettes to liven up long programs,  
cleansing the palette, so to speak, between informational programming” \(www  
.dannelsonproductions.com\). Performers, performances, and attractions should be  
incorporated where and when they will effectively enhance the achievement of the  
desired event experience and deliver a return on the investment made.  
Entertainment costs can range from a few hundred dollars for a local disc  
jockey to a high six-figure price for nationally known headliner acts \(and into  
the millions for an iconic performer\). Do not buy more—or less—than you  
need. If all you need is chaser or background music, using recorded music might  
be perfectly sufficient, but if investing in a headliner act will help you meet your  
attendance objectives, then that is where you put your money. If what you need is  
an evenings entertainment for a conference or business meeting, you might simply  
purchase a block of tickets to a local concert, theatrical performance, fair, or sports  
event \(perhaps with a special lounge area\), rather than mounting your own event  
production. Establish your criteria and seek out the best value for your budget. Selecting and Booking Entertainment 235

Figure 8.2 Entertainment and Entertainer Sample Resources 236 Staging an Engaging Experience  
Nelson and Matheny \(1998\) advise, “Choose entertainment that fits the  
demographics and projects the appropriate image, never buy your personal taste,  
and... remember when you purchase entertainment, it is the entertainment value  
you are buying, not the number of bodies onstage.” You must also consider the  
duration of the performance within the duration of the program. You might wish  
to hire a small band or DJ to fill in the gaps between acts or sets for a larger act.  
\(A set—the length of time a musical group plays—is usually 45 minutes long with  
15 minutes off for a break.\)  
Your entertainment options may include professional entertainers, semiprofes-  
sionals, and amateurs, categories that do not necessarily indicate performance  
quality \(but often reflect the cost\), and will be affected by the providers avail-  
able where and when your event is to take place. To locate these resources, you  
might contact local or national entertainment agencies, speakers bureaus, local  
performing arts and fine arts groups, community groups, schools, and local visitor  
bureaus and chambers of commerce. \(Many local, nonprofessional groups such as  
community bands or school choruses can provide low-budget, even free, yet high-  
quality entertainment.\) Consult directories, check with performing arts guilds, and  
search the Internet. And, as fresh new entertainers and entertainment concepts are  
developed continuously, you should also review trade publications and periodicals,  
attend industry conferences and showcases, and network with other professional  
event coordinators.  
Preview Before Contracting  
You should preview entertainment acts and performers before booking them  
\(if possible\) because you need to know what you are purchasing. You might arrange  
to visit another event where the speaker, group, or entertainer is performing \(with  
permission from that event's organizer or host\), view videotaped examples, listen to  
a demo audiotape or CD, or preview the text of a speech or speaker's PowerPoint  
slideshow. You may need to rely on another person who has seen the performance  
and makes a strong recommendation. Such recommendations might come from  
someone within your organization, a professional talent consultant, or the references  
you have been given. You might decide to hold auditions for certain performers  
and participants. Professional performers expect this and will be prepared to provide  
you with the access or preview materials you need to make a decision. Disc jockey  
companies advise that you confirm that the specific DJ you have seen is the one who  
will be performing at your event; many companies have numerous DJs who vary in  
quality and style.  
Contracts—The Offer and the Agent  
Professional entertainers often work with entertainment agents or agencies  
that manage their bookings, negotiations, and contracts. In regard to booking Selecting and Booking Entertainment  
entertainment, Mark Sonder, CSEP, of Chantilly, Virginia—based Mark Sonder  
Productions, advises, “Three words, forms, forms, forms! If it is not written down,  
it didn’t happen. I can tell you that headliners are not managers or agents. They do  
their thing and hopefully they do it well, but they may not be thinking about the  
specifics of your event, as that does not impact their art, their work, their creativity,  
their love, their performance.”  
Once the specific entertainer has been approved by the client, the booking  
process begins. For many professional entertainers, this process includes\:  
Artist's booking agent and/or agency is contacted to determine specific fees  
and costs \(e.g., technical and hospitality rider specifications\).  
Client \(the purchaser\) authorizes the issuance of the artist offer letter with  
all performance and payment details to the performer via agent or agency.  
Artist \(entertainer\) decides whether he or she will accept the offer \(usually  
based on availability\).  
\* Artist accepts the offer, communicated via agent and/or agency.  
¢ An engagement agreement or contract is executed.  
It is important to understand that within this process, the artist offer letter is a  
legally binding contract if accepted and signed by the artist.  
Connie Riley, CSEP, of T. Skorman Productions, Inc., in Orlando, Florida, a  
talent booking agency as well as a production firm, explains that the ben-  
efits of booking talent through an entertainment agency include matching  
the right entertainment with the event objectives and audience. Because  
the agency knows the talent—good and bad, stylistic differences, and  
entertainer requirements—and, through its networks, knows artists’ agents  
all over the country and the world, it can find the best entertainment and  
entertainment value wherever an event is to take place, providing qualified  
talent to meet the needs of the event and the expectations of the buyer.  
The entertainment agency also offers protection for both the purchaser  
and the talent. “You don’t want the act feeling abused and performing  
badly, and you don’t want the client feeling abused and taking it out on the act  
on-site. Our job is to be the buffer to make certain everyone's needs are met’  
For example, an association insisted on two acts on one stage, an opener act  
and a headliner act to follow immediately. When the opening act accidentally  
damaged a cable that sent a power surge through the headliner act's personal  
equipment and destroyed it, the on-site entertainment agency representative  
continues  
237  
# ON-SITE  
\_INSIGHT 238 Staging an Engaging Experience  
was the one who delivered the bad news to the headliner act, negotiated  
with its members to use different equipment and still perform, even though,  
by contract, they were not legally obligated to, and arranged for the sub-  
stitute equipment so that the concert, although delayed a bit, went on and  
thrilled the audience.  
Riley went on to explain\: “If people don’t deal with entertainers, they  
don't understand the egos, the personalities, or the sensitivities. Most clients  
don’t understand how performers prepare themselves for a performance,  
and the last thing you want before you go onstage is someone telling you  
something that is going to break your concentration. In one instance, the  
client had booked a stand-up comedian with a well-known reputation for  
slightly “raw” material, and right before he walked onstage the client caught  
him, as he was walking up the steps, and said, “Please be careful. Don't say  
anything too explicit.” You just don’t tell someone to curb his routine right as  
he walks onstage. Of course this distracted the comedian, he lost his focus,  
and he had a bad show. And then the clients don’t understand when they  
don’t get the show they thought they were getting.”  
Contract Riders—Requirements and Hidden Costs  
A contract rider is a list, specific to each entertainer or entertainment act, of what  
the performer requires in order to perform or make an appearance. It “rides,” or  
is attached to, the contract \(hence the term rider\) and includes everything from  
transportation to technical requirements to the type of food and beverages required  
\(see Figure 8.3\). It is a legally binding part of the contract or engagement agreement  
between the artist and the purchaser, but some of the points within it may be nego-  
tiated prior to the contract. This is when it is advantageous to secure entertainment  
through a talent buyer or booking agent who knows the entertainment group and  
which items are negotiable.  
The technical portion of the rider, which includes all the equipment and  
staging requirements, may also include a detailed description of the stage plot,  
including a diagram showing the layout of the stage, the artist’s position, and where  
all the equipment, microphones, props, and so forth, are to be positioned. This  
portion can be accompanied by an entire production list including lighting plots,  
audio equipment specifications, power distribution requirements, and the provision  
and number of stagehands, riggers, and costume assistants. The larger the act, the  
more complicated the rider will probably be; some headliner acts’ riders comprise Selecting and Booking Entertainment 239

because they show exactly how a certain performer achieves certain special effects  
and are therefore not issued until after the acceptance of the offer. This is another  
reason to work with a talent buyer or entertainment agency—so you are able to  
calculate the true costs of an appearance before you issue an offer.  
Figure 8.3  
Rider Requirements  
Checklist  
Integrate Needs and Logistics  
Whether you are engaging a headliner act or a simple community choir, you must  
incorporate the entertainer’s technical and performance needs and logistics into  
your event plan and production schedule. If they require dressing rooms with  
showers \(perhaps to wash off the body makeup they use\), you might need to secure  
an executive-style portable toilet or a motor home with a shower to be parked next  
to the facility or stage. If an act is arriving in its own tour bus and requires shore  
power \(a power source connection to the building’s power\), you may need to desig-  
nate parking areas differently. If a group specifies a certain artist’s billing, this must  
be factored into your printing schedule and layout. If it stipulates the prohibition  
of cameras in the audience, you may need to add security personnel at the entrance  
to the event to check people’s belongings and a storage desk where any cameras  
found will be tagged and stored for pickup after the performance.  
It is no less important to consider all these ramifications for a small or amateur  
entertainment group. Whether the group has a rider or not, you should determine  
what its specific needs will be. The community choir may need parking spaces and 240 Staging an Engaging Experience  
passes for all its members. A children’s group might require sufficient dressing room  
or lounge space to accommodate all the children’s parents. And you might have to  
control family members who want to see their children performing. \(I have had  
to have aunts and uncles removed by security personnel, and then threaten to  
never use the group again if they didn’t cease their protests asserting their rights to see  
their nieces or nephews perform.\)  
Special attention will be required for any entertainment attraction featuring  
live animals. This could include anything ranging from petting zoos to exotic  
creatures as live décor or props for a photo station, to pet parades or adoption  
events. The treatment and welfare of the animal must be considered from its  
arrival to departure, including how the animal will be transported to and from  
the event site \(especially if the event site is inside a building\), cared for and  
controlled while on-site, and protected from inappropriate interaction with  
attendees \(and vice versa\). You must also consider practical aspects such as floor  
coverings or cleaning services to deal with the “call of nature” and other messy  
incidents that are likely to occur.  
Evaluate the Value  
The professional event coordinator must always evaluate the return on investment  
for the entertainment included in an event as well as the entertainers used. Did  
you provide enough entertainment? Was it scheduled effectively? Were there gaps  
in the program? Did the investment in the headliner act meet your expectations?  
Robert Jackson \(1997, 29-30\) advises, “Watch the audience or spectators—not  
the show. No matter what the stage action may be, if this show is not for this  
crowd, for any reason, their actions will speak a lot louder than whatever applause  
they may offer out of politeness. ShufHling in seats; whispering or talking; yawns;  
reading something; nail-cleaning, -filing or -biting—all are the only ‘reviews’ you  
need to let you know that you have a problem.” You must learn from each event  
you coordinate, and you should help the entertainers you use learn by letting  
them know what went right and what went wrong \(and perhaps exploring the  
reasons so you may both benefit from the experience\).  
You can add value to an entertainer’s appearance by determining early in the  
booking process where, when, and how that performer can contribute to the suc-  
cess of the event experience. Many entertainers have appeared at a broad variety of  
events and have valuable suggestions as to how they can improve or enhance their  
appearance within the context of your event, if you share with them the purpose,  
objectives, theme, and overall schedule, and you ask them. Mark Sonder, CSEP  
advises,  
Communicate to the performers who the client is and what the expectations are.  
If the event is a birthday party, the performers will want to introduce the birthday  
boy or girl and be ready with a rendition, in the style of music they perform, of Managing Personalities and Performers  
241  
“Happy Birthday.” On the other hand, in a corporate setting, the performers may  
“need” to mention the corporate message or new product line from the stage. The meeting  
or event producer must communicate these objectives to the leader of the performers or  
a nonperformer staff person charged with the responsibility to deal with the performers.  
That person, in turn, will communicate this to all the performers.  
Managing Personalities  
and Performers  
The performing artist, whether celebrity or amateur, speaker or musician, solo-  
ist or part of a group, is concerned primarily with one thing—giving the best  
performance possible. In order to do that, he or she must feel comfortable with  
the environment and the emotional atmosphere surrounding the performance.  
No matter how long the artist has been a performer, or how blasé the artist seems  
to appear, anyone going “onstage” has deep concerns about the response he or  
she will receive. Even the most famous celebrities and experienced performers  
will sometimes admit to experiencing severe nervousness or “butterflies” before  
going onstage. The professional event coordinator can do a number of things  
to ensure a stellar performance, such as demonstrating respect, communicating  
expectations in a timely manner, and providing what the performer needs to  
do his or her job.  
Performer and Performance Expectations  
The performing artist expects to be treated with care and regard. The artist needs  
to feel appreciated both onstage and off. The artist also needs to feel protected—  
from unsafe and/or substandard conditions that may jeopardize the performance,  
as well as from performing before the “wrong” audience. Nothing enhances a  
performance more than an enthusiastic audience, and nothing destroys a perfor-  
mance more quickly than an unreceptive one. Although entertainers may seem  
demanding or needy, you must recognize that, quite often, behind the self-centered  
facade is a very fragile ego. The artist’s value should be recognized in word, deed,  
and compensation, which includes expressing your appreciation for the performer's  
contribution, providing the arrangements and amenities requested, and making  
prompt payments.  
You must communicate the needs of the event and expectations for all perfor-  
mances early, clearly, and in writing. You must also communicate any changes or  
adjustments in a timely manner. If the start of the performance is to be delayed  
for some reason or a problem has arisen, you must tell the entertainers as soon as  
you know and describe the cause of the delay. The entertainers might be able to 242 Staging an Engaging Experience  
assist you. When members of a dance group did not show up for an event I was  
producing \(they got lost\), the jazz singer offered to do another set to fill the gap  
in the program. When a speaker canceled at the last minute for a conference at  
which I was speaking, I agreed to give the presentation because that speaker's topic  
was in my repertoire.  
Establish Performer Guidelines  
As in any employment situation, the professional event coordinator must estab-  
lish an atmosphere of mutual respect and be supportive of optimal performance  
with the entertainment artists for an event. And, like the actual employees of an  
event organization, all performers should be provided with the rules and guide-  
lines established to achieve the optimal working atmosphere. Most entertain-  
ment agencies have a set of performer guidelines they require their artists to  
adhere to, and these should be reviewed to ensure that they are sufficient and  
appropriate for the needs of the event. Connie Riley, CSEP, explains that these  
guidelines have been developed to address the “hot buttons that disturb the cli-  
ents expecting a certain level of professionalism. Many entertainers don't under-  
stand the protocols or ethics because they've just never been told. They don't  
know the client is being charged for the food and beverage on a per-head basis.  
They don’t know that the end client may be several levels away from the person  
or agency that booked them.”  
You should also generate your own set of performer guidelines to make available  
to performers you book directly, including local, semiprofessional, or amateur  
entertainment artists or groups \(do not submit them to headliner acts—these are  
professionals and such guidelines will be covered in their riders\). The guidelines  
shown in Figure 8.4 protect and serve both the artist and your organization and  
should answer questions before they need to be asked to ensure a mutually profit-  
able and professional experience for everyone.  
Performer Rehearsals  
A singer who has performed the same songs for 20 or 30 years will still want and  
need a rehearsal before a performance. A dance group that has performed all over  
the world will still want and need to rehearse their dance on a particular stage. Even the  
cast that has performed the same play on the same stage for weeks or months on  
end will still have pickup rehearsals to refine and refresh their performance. It is  
no wonder, then, that one-time events require orientations and rehearsals prior to their  
start. Not only does the technical equipment and timing need to be checked, the  
performers need to practice their movements and voicing within the environment  
specific to the particular venue.  
Every event venue has a “feel” of its own, and every performer needs to get a  
feel for that space. Speakers need to prepare their materials at the lectern and/or Managing Personalities and Performers 243

preapproved\).  
Specify the locations of dressing room\(s\) and/or break areas and the amenities to be  
provided \(e.g., food, beverage, etc.\). Also specify where the support crew is to take breaks  
or wait during the performance, including parents or guardians.  
Specify that the artist is prohibited from eating or drinking from the guest food service,  
even if offered \(by client or guest\).  
Unless stipulated within the rider, specify that the artist must not bring personal guests  
\(without prior permission\).  
Specify how gratuities, if offered, are to be handled.  
Specify how the artist is to handle special music requests by a client and/or guest. Stipulate  
that all problems or inquiries regarding the performance specifications or fees are to be

equipment \(e.g., hand trucks, trolleys, etc.\), and the load-out time for the artist's equipment.  
Specify the exact location \(i.e., building, room, etc.\) of the performance and provide  
directions \(and/or a map\) to the site. Stipulate that the artist is responsible for  
transportation to and from the venue \(or meeting area for shuttle to the site\) and for  
knowing how to get there.  
Specify whether the artist is encouraged or allowed to mingle with guests before, during  
breaks, or after performance.  
Specify with whom the artist is to check in upon arrival, and provide a contact number  
for the artist to call should he or she be running late or have an emergency. Also secure  
contact numbers for the artist, preferably for a cell or mobile telephone, so the coordinator  
may reach the artist while en route.

form to the coordinator, notifying the booking agency, etc.\).  
Specify the artist's responsibility for parking, including designated parking areas,  
reimbursement \(if any\) of fees, validation, and/or parking passes. Stipulate that the artist  
must not request parking validation, fee reimbursement, or passes from the client or  
venue.  
Specify how and when the artist will receive payment for the performance. Stipulate that  
the artist must not discuss with or request payment from the client.  
Specify smoking policies. Many entertainment agencies prohibit smoking anywhere  
onstage or within function rooms, and many venues prohibit smoking anywhere on the  
premises.  
Specify storage areas for the artist's equipment, packing cases, and personal effects,  
including security measures or personnel to be \(or not to be\) provided and artist's  
responsibility for materials stored.

walk through the audience area. Singers need to vocalize, and musicians need to  
play their instruments under performance conditions to ensure that the sounds  
are accurate. Dancers need to accustom themselves to the size and surface of the  
stage. Gymnastic or aerial performers need to test their apparatus and actions.  
Connie Riley, CSEP, advises that you schedule a minimum of eight hours prior to  
the start of an event \(after all other staging, décor, and electrical components are  
in place\) for headliner acts to move in, set up their equipment, and rehearse, and  
a minimum of three hours for a standard band.  
Purchaser Obligations  
The professional event coordinator must ensure that the performance of music  
complies with music licensing regulations and that the appropriate fees are paid  
to the applicable performance rights organizations \(see Figure 8.5\). Performance  
rights organizations collect royalties for nondramatic performances of intellec-  
tual property, which are, in turn, paid to the various publishers and authors  
associated with a particular recording or performance. There are exemptions  
from music licensing fees for certain private life-cycle events, but you must  
become familiar with these regulations and plan to comply. The fees are based  
on the context in which the performance takes place, the manner in which  
the music is performed \(live, track act—live performance to taped music, or  
recorded\), and the size of the audience. It is technically the responsibility of  
the host or sponsoring organization to pay these fees, but you should apprise the  
client of this requirement or you might be subject to vicarious liability for  
unauthorized use. Wrap Up

Organizations  
An engaging experience must be engineered, structured, and choreographed so  
that it delivers a strong opening, a satisfying core, and a meaningful climax. The  
structure and components must be designed to meet the needs and expectations  
of both the host and guest, delivering the event experience they desire. The  
professional event coordinator uses the tools and techniques of the dramatist  
to create a progressive and rewarding experience, which includes dimension,  
diversity, builds, respites, focus, balance, contrast, and rhythm. Entertainment  
elements may be added at numerous times and in numerous places to facili-  
tate a well-crafted experience, provide entertaining solutions to challenges, and  
enhance occasions of all types.  
The professional event coordinator should script the program, arranging the  
event elements and entertainment or edutainment components in the proper  
sequence to deliver the event experience as designed. This sequence is often dictated  
by necessity, ritual, and/or protocol, but controls are often necessary to ensure a  
cohesive presentation with the proper pacing and content. The final script, which  
may be generated in a variety of formats depending on the uses and users, must  
have the consensus of all those involved in the event production and must be  
distributed appropriately.  
Selecting and booking speakers or entertainment is a detailed process. The  
professional event coordinator determines the most appropriate presenters, 246 Staging an Engaging Experience  
entertainment, and/or attractions, based on the goals and objectives of the event,  
the event’s character and its audience, and the resources available. Entertainers,  
performers, and presenters may be amateur, semiprofessional, or professional;  
local or regional; headliner acts or celebrities. They may be booked directly  
by the professional event coordinator, but often are booked through a speak-  
ers bureau, talent buyer, or entertainment agency, which manages the many  
negotiations, contractual obligations, and logistical specifications associated  
with professional artists. The professional event coordinator must understand  
the personality traits and needs specific to performing artists and then provide the  
necessary information and guidelines to ensure a good performance and good  
relationship based on mutual respect. All music licensing regulations and  
union requirements must be met.

Ancillary programs and events are those outside, “on the side,” or in conjunction  
with the main event that the professional event coordinator includes to add  
value to the event and meet the needs of the event attendees. These activities and  
programs are added to an event to give further dimension to the overall event  
experience and attend to the needs and desires of the guest and the guest's guest.  
They can include companion or guest programs, tours before, during, and after the  
event, sports and recreational activities, and a broad variety of mini-events  
within an event. They are meant to entertain, inform, amuse, and enrich the  
participants, and they must be managed as carefully and conscientiously as any  
other part of the event experience. Note\: Ancillary activities may also refer to  
revenue-generating support services within a facility.  
Whether such programs are considered ancillary, auxiliary, subordinate, sub-  
sidiary, or supplementary is often a matter of degree or emphasis within the  
event context. A trade show might be ancillary to an educational conference,  
or educational sessions might be ancillary to a trade show. Tours might be an  
optional activity or an integral part of the event agenda. Tournaments might be  
the purpose of the event or might be added to build a team spirit or satisfy the  
desire for leisure pursuits. Ancillary events must be integrated into the main  
event with the same understanding of—and attention to—the goals and objec-  
tives, site requirements, budgetary implications, timeline influences, logistical  
concerns, and marketing endeavors \(see Figure 9.1\).  
Companion Programs  
Companion programs are special programs and events created and coordinated  
to entertain and occupy accompanying persons while the main event takes place.  
These programs have variously been referred to as spouse programs, family pro-  
grams, leisure programs, partner programs, companion programs, and accom-  
panying person programs. They are most often employed for meetings and  
convention events, but might be suitable for other events in which the attendee Companion Programs

enues to the hosting organization.  
Companion programs may be a selection of sightseeing tours highlighting  
the destination or a series of presentations paralleling the programming pro-  
vided for the main delegate. These include special or optional tours, entertain-  
ment attractions, recreational activities, self-improvement classes, shopping  
excursions, or special services \(see Figure 9.2\). They must be selected based on  
sound market research, meeting the needs and desires of the main delegate and  
the accompanying persons as well as adding value to the event experience, and  
then promoted aggressively to their intended markets.  
Develop a Customer Profile  
When considering and selecting companion programs, the professional event  
coordinator must understand, first and foremost, that not all companions or  
spouses are women. Morrow \(1997, 383\) advises, “Today a spouse/partner may  
refer to a husband, significant other, friends, gay lovers. Rather than typecasting  
potential tag-along attendees as partners or spouses, consider the generic term  
guest.” This semantic shift will allow the selection of options and offerings that  
are gender-neutral.  
You should examine the history of companion programs for the particular event  
and analyze the demographics of the potential program participants \(usually  
parallel to the demographics of the delegates or attendees at the main event—age,  
economic and geographic status, etc.\). Customer relations management \(CRM\)

program demand trends and topics \(Hogg 2010\). You might also survey the  
attendees and/or convene a focus group of past companion program participants  
to determine the preferred types and frequency of offerings. It is also important to  
survey the potential companion program market to determine what influ-  
ences a companion’s decision to accompany a delegate. Is it the destination? Is  
it the time of year? Is it a matter of time poverty dictating the need for them to  
spend time together? The answers to these and other questions will help shape  
the components and scheduling of a companion program.  
Scheduling Considerations  
A companion program should be scheduled to be concurrent with the main  
event, yet should not conflict with the delegate’s schedule of “free time” or  
detract from the delegate’s participation in the main event. If the delegate is  
to be engaged for the entire day, then the companion program should provide  
offerings, either half-day or full-day options, that end at the same time the  
delegate’s program ends. If the delegate is to be engaged in the main event  
only until midafternoon, the companion program should offer only half-day  
and luncheon options, then perhaps a late afternoon option that the delegate and  
companion can enjoy together. If an attendee will be traveling through numerous  
time zones \(such as overseas\) to attend the main event, you should not schedule  
important or intensive activities on the first day. Companion Programs  
253  
You might wish to include an entertaining orientation program on the host  
country’s culture for both delegate and companion on the first day. It could  
include presentations by area experts and representatives of the major attractions,  
a question-and-answer session to discuss important information about the area  
attractions, how to get around, the city’s nightlife, and even a local “character”  
to present amusing anecdotes and insider tips. You might include a “goody bag”  
\(a gift bag\) filled with brochures of area attractions, maps, souvenir gifts, tickets,  
and/or coupons for shopping attractions. You may also arrange for special prizes,  
donated by area attractions or other sponsors, to be given out randomly during  
the presentation.  
When packaging a companion program, the professional event coordinator  
should merge the ancillary event with the main event, offering the accompanying  
person\(s\) the opportunity—at a price if necessary—to attend all appropriate  
meal functions and receptions along with the delegate. If there are “must see”  
attractions at a destination, they might be offered as pre- or postevent tours or  
incorporated into the main event’s programming, with the companions offered  
a pass or ticket to attend that part of the program. If the delegates are going to  
participate in a golf or other tournament, transportation might be offered for the  
companions wishing to attend and observe, and/or parallel sport activities might  
be developed at the same site. Always remember that the companion has accom-  
panied the delegate so that they can spend time together.  
Pricing and Marketing Factors  
If not included as a budget expenditure, the pricing of the companion program  
offerings should cover the actual costs, the administrative costs, and a modest profit  
\(if appropriate\). The offerings selected should be in a price range reflecting the  
economic price points of the main event—if the main event is targeted at a lower-price  
market, the companion program offerings should also be in a lower price range,  
particularly if they are optional. You could lose delegate participation in certain  
main event components \(such as dinners and/or receptions\) if the companion must  
pay an unusually or unreasonably high price for a ticket to accompany the delegate.  
People are very price conscious and will compare cost-benefit factors closely. You  
might also wish to explore sponsorships to underwrite program costs.  
Once you have decided to offer a companion program, it must be incorpo-  
rated into the overall marketing strategy and promoted from the very beginning  
to ensure participation. Unless the program is optional and being handled com-  
pletely independently by a destination management company \(DMC\) or pro-  
fessional congress organizer \(PCO\), the companion program options should be  
included in the main event's registration materials and delegates should be able  
to include payment with all other registration fees and options. Even if the regis-  
tration and fees are being handled by a DMC or PCO, the event should promote 254 Ancillary Programs  
the program in all its materials, from invitation to Web site, to ensure that it  
contributes to the purchase decision to attend the main event. Including a com-  
panion program adds value to the main event by attracting those seeking opportu-  
nities to travel together and offering meaningful experiences for both delegates  
and accompanying persons.  
Enrichment Programs and Activities  
People are looking for entertaining yet enriching experiences. Many participants  
in companion programs are looking for value through authenticity, adventure,  
inspiration, and education. Simply offering sightseeing tours and tea parties  
might not attract as many participants as providing a program rich with culture  
and adventure. Although shopping remains an extremely popular activity, par-  
ticipants are looking for exclusive access to shopping venues, shopping focused  
on indigenous and unusual items, and information on their manufacture,  
important product attributes, and special bargains particular to a destination.  
Offering special-interest lectures, hands-on workshops, seminars, and classes  
can provide added value. These often include a broad variety of life and business  
skills. Many delegates and accompanying persons are from dual-career house-  
holds, and the offering made available to the accompanying person might have  
to focus on the same lifelong learning objectives as the delegate’s. Companion  
program components might even be qualified for continuing education units  
\(CEU\) if structured and registered correctly with an academic institution or  
certification body.  
Showcasing the Destination  
The companion program, as well as other ancillary events, should take advantage  
of the attractions and features of the main event’s destination. These should be  
carefully considered in light of the companion program when conducting your  
site selection and inspection procedures. Showcase the destination with program  
offerings that include its historic, cultural, and commercial attractions, facilities,  
sites, and events. Take advantage of the concurrent events and opportunities  
that will occur while the main event takes place by checking the calendar of events  
available through the destination’s convention and visitors bureau, tourism office,  
or chamber of commerce.  
Perhaps you can reserve a block of tickets to a theatrical production or dinner  
theater attraction. You might be able to arrange special talks or tours in con-  
junction with an exhibit that will be on display at a local museum. If one of the  
destination’s highlights is a body of water such as a lake, bay, or river, you should  
probably arrange for an excursion on a passenger or sailing vessel. If the venue is  
nestled in the mountains, you might wish to arrange for a nature walk. You might  
offer four-wheel-drive or jeep excursions in a desert setting or a photo safari ina Companion Programs  
255  
jungle. Celebrate the indigenous culture and environment for which the destination  
is famous. For example, when in New York City, you might highlight the theater,  
in Washington. D.C., the national monuments, in Los Angeles the film industry,  
in Paris the Eiffel Tower, in London the royals, in Venice the canals, in Japan  
the tea ceremony, and so forth.  
Children’s Programs  
An increasing number of children are accompanying delegates and attendees  
to events as the pressure of dual-career or single-parent households shrinks the  
amount of quality time the family has to spend together. Events, ranging from  
conferences to festivals, are incorporating children’s and youth activities into  
their programs to attract the family market segment and provide a safe and  
entertaining component that adds value to the overall event experience. Morrow  
\(1997, 386\) advises, “The first step is to ensure that you are able to actually host  
such a program. Some state and municipal jurisdictions, facility policies, and/or  
insurance requirements might prohibit you from providing basic child care ser-  
vices.” In addition, in many jurisdictions you must provide proof regarding your  
fitness and experience when providing services for children.  
A children’s program should match the hours and major events or sessions of  
the main adult event, including sufficient time before and after main event elements  
for parents to drop off and pick up the children. Any children’s program should  
include the following elements\:  
° Admission and discharge procedures——Establish a complete registration  
process, including a signed general release from parent or guardian; require  
parent or guardian to check in and check out a child via identity checks and  
signatures; provide waivers and/or permission forms for physical activities  
and off-site excursions.  
\* Activity plans—Activity plans should be age-appropriate, include  
socially interactive and self-directed activities, and focus on entertain-  
ment and fun.  
\* Discipline policy—Define the rules and the manner in which discipline  
will be dispensed \(physical punishment, shaming, verbal abuse, or with-  
holding food is considered inappropriate discipline\); define the terms and  
conditions that would result in expelling a child from the program.  
° Appropriate personnel—Require certified, trained, and/or bonded child care  
providers and supervisors, licensed or accredited by the proper authorities,  
sometimes including completion of a Child Abuse Record Information  
background check.  
° Proper insurance coverage—Determine the type\(s\) of liability insurance  
required in your jurisdiction, such as general commercial liability, or profes-  
sional liability/negligent supervision. 256 Ancillary Programs  
Indulgences and Special Services  
The professional event coordinator may arrange for a variety of salon and spa  
options to allow participants to indulge themselves in luxurious and sensual treat-  
ments and services. These amenities can range from manicures, pedicures, skin,  
hair, and other beauty treatments, to therapeutic massages and relaxation therapies,  
and might be of interest to both the delegate and the accompanying person. Often,  
these services are already available on-site, particularly at resort properties, for which  
appointments can be reserved. Alternately, special appointments can be made at  
local salons. Hair stylists and makeup artists can be reserved for guests attending a  
gala function or brought in for the members of a wedding party. A tuxedo rental  
service might be arranged for gentlemen attending a formal conference event, with  
an order form included in the conference registration materials. Perhaps a separate  
registration desk for these services can be set up adjacent to the main registration  
area for the event so that attendees can make appointments upon arrival.  
Variety, Balance, and Safety  
A companion program should provide sufficient variety to attract a broad spectrum  
of participation, including a balance of active, passive, and adventurous options  
that will appeal to those of all ages, genders, and physical abilities. The professional  
event coordinator might be required to coordinate these programs as part of an  
overall program, such as an incentive trip, or might elect to coordinate them as  
options in conjunction with a main event, such as a conference or exposition, to  
increase attendance. You must ensure that only reputable providers, meeting all  
safety, regulatory, and licensing requirements, are selected to supply these services.  
Sometimes it is necessary to obtain special waivers required from participants or  
special riders to the hosting organization's insurance policy.  
Optional Tours and Trips  
Optional tours and trips can be offered in conjunction with a main event to  
enhance, enrich, or extend the event experience \(see Figure 9.3\). These activities  
are most often made available when the majority of attendees are traveling to  
the event from other parts of the country or the world, to create added value  
and provide them with an opportunity to take advantage of a tourism objec-  
tive or perspective at the destination. Sightseeing tours primarily focus on the  
indigenous culture, environment, and attractions. Adventure tours and themed  
excursions offer an opportunity to participate in unique activities that people  
are not usually able to engage in on their own. Other types of tours, such as  
industrial/facility tours or learning journeys, can be included in an event agenda  
to address an educational or promotional objective. Optional Tours and Trips

Typical Tours and  
Trip Options  
Create a Menu of Tour Options  
The professional event coordinator should arrange for a menu of options to be  
offered to event attendees and accompanying persons, for purchase prior to arrival  
through a preregistration mechanism or upon arrival at a tour desk adjacent to  
the main registration area. The purchase decision will be based on the following  
factors, which you must take into consideration when selecting the tour offerings\:  
© Price—ZThe price must provide value for money and must be within a range  
suitable for the economic demographics of the audience. Prices for sightsee-  
ing tours should be inclusive of all entrance fees for attractions and meals  
or refreshments on the tour. Prices for over-the-road tours \(multiday tours,  
staying overnight at a hotel/motel\) should include the accommodations,  
entrance fees for attractions, porterage, and the meals specified in the itinerary  
description. Prices often vary, depending on whether the tour is given during  
a low, shoulder, or peak season. 258 Ancillary Programs  
° Itinerary—The itinerary should include a balance of attractions packaged  
in an interesting progression. It must clearly, concisely, and correctly iden-  
tify the attractions, accommodations; mode of travel, and meals included  
in the tour, as well as whether the tour will have an escort or step-on guide or  
the driver will be providing the topical commentary on the sights, history,  
and attractions. Marilyn J. Reis \(2001, 93, 104\) advises, “There is a world of  
difference between ‘visit,’ ‘stop,’ ‘see,’ and ‘drive past.’” The language  
of the itinerary description must be precise because it may serve as a bind-  
ing agreement, which, according to Reis, is subject to stringent consumer  
protection laws that favor the consumer \(particularly in countries other  
than the United States, a fact that international travelers are well aware  
of\). Reis notes, “Whatever a U.S.-based supplier puts in a brochure or on  
its Web site, whatever is promised, and whatever is said regarding delivery  
become the basis for the overseas clients’ expectations.”  
\* Pace—The volume and scheduling of activities should allow for a real-  
istic operation and provide a “balance of travel time, sightseeing, social  
events, free time, and rest” \(Goldblatt and Nelson 2001, 139\). The pace  
of the itinerary might be fast or slower, depending on the attributes of  
the attractions visited and the special interests of the group, as well as the  
demographics and size of the group.  
\* Schedule harmony— \[he full- and half-day tour options, as well as pre- and  
postevent trips, must begin and end in concurrence with the schedule of  
the main event. When offering a variety of sightseeing tours throughout a  
multiday event for a large group, you might wish to repeat the most popular  
ones on several days so that guests are not faced with an “either/or” choice  
but can package the experience they prefer. Evening options such as a din-  
ner and/or entertainment attraction should be offered only if and when the  
main event does not have something scheduled. Tours should return in time  
for participants to dress for evening events or to participate in other events  
in the main event such as receptions, exhibits, or meal functions.  
For those groups requiring something extra or out of the ordinary \(e.g., incen-  
tive programs\), the professional event coordinator might need to work with a tour  
operator or DMC to create new and/or exclusive itineraries that include attractions  
not usually available to the individual tourist. Custom tours can also be created to  
take advantage of concurrent events such as festivals, entertainment attractions, or  
sports events. Because many tour operators serve both the individual and group  
markets with the same menu, it might be necessary to guarantee a certain number  
of participants to warrant a separate motor coach; otherwise your guests will be  
mingled with individual travelers or other groups on the same tour. It is helpful to  
find out when tours arrive and depart certain popular attractions or restaurants so  
that guests are not delayed or underserved during high-traffic peak times. Optional Tours and Trips  
259  
Extending the Experience  
Consider offering pre- and postevent tours and package trips for groups traveling  
to a destination to allow guests to extend the event experience. Group or FIT \(For  
Independent Traveler\) travel packages may be arranged through a tour operator  
or coordinated by the professional event coordinator. These tours or packages can  
provide those interested in an additional vacation or extended stay with an oppor-  
tunity to visit attractions that are outside the usual radius of travel time allowed  
for half- or full-day tours \(usually a maximum of 60 to 100 miles for a full-day tour\)  
or experience more attractions available at a destination \(particularly at popular  
resort destinations\). The pricing and coordination of these offerings will depend  
on the destination, size of group, time of year, and the attractions, services, and  
amenities included in the package. If presented in conjunction with the overall  
event program, these offerings must be marketed early and aggressively so that  
potential participants can make plans accordingly.  
The Web site of an event can become the portal to a plethora of information  
about the event site’s features and attractions by providing hyperlinks to the  
destination’s convention and visitors or tourism bureau’s Web site and/or the  
Web sites of area attractions featured in the companion programs or optional  
tours menu. Adding a hyperlink to a calendar of events allows your guests to  
view and select concurrent or close-in events to attend in conjunction with your  
event. You might also wish to search out and include hyperlinks to Web sites  
that provide historical or cultural information related to the destination, so as  
to allow those interested to prepare for a deeper and more enriching experience.  
Recreation and Leisure Access  
Many tour operators offer packages that primarily provide transportation and  
admissions to popular attractions such as theme parks, water parks, or nature parks  
and recreational activities such as horseback riding, golf, fishing, or skiing.  
Although the individual visitor can certainly make these arrangements indepen-  
dently, by offering these packages the professional event coordinator facilitates  
participation for those who may not have their own transportation and/or may  
not feel comfortable navigating a new environment. This can be particularly  
important if the group speaks a different language\(s\) than that of the destina-  
tion, and if this is the case, it will be necessary to ensure that the tour operator  
has special or multilanguage capabilities specific to that group.  
Often, the simple provision of shuttle services will be a welcome amenity for  
event participants and accompanying persons. Such services may be used to pro-  
vide scheduled transportation to and from shopping areas, casinos, and historic  
districts. You should investigate these areas and outlets to determine whether they  
have existing shuttle services or would be willing to provide this service for your  
group. Particularly if your group is large, these outlets might see the value of 260 Ancillary Programs  
providing complimentary transportation to their properties, and all you may  
need to do is work with them to develop.the schedule and pickup points.  
Individual activity providers, such as operators of hot air balloon rides, might  
be interested in packaging special deals just for your group and will customize  
their standard offerings, as well as their brochures, just for your event.  
Some recreational activities do not necessarily require transportation—just  
access to an appropriate space and place—such as a bridge or chess tournament,  
and you can coordinate the requisite area and equipment to accommodate these  
activities. You might wish to purchase or reserve a block of tickets to entertainment  
attractions and/or performances \(and arrange transfer transportation\) to ensure  
that your attendees will have access on the day or time that best fits into the overall  
event schedule. Any of these special arrangements must be highlighted in  
your event promotional materials to ensure participation, as well as to illustrate your  
attention to the details that will add value to their event experience.  
Excursions and Adventures  
The athletic will likely want active options such as hiking, whitewater river rafting,  
jet ski rides, scuba diving, bicycle tours, bungee jumping, and other vigorous  
activities. The adventurous will likely take advantage of options such as jeep or  
four-wheel-drive expeditions, wildlife excursions, and helicopter tours to remote  
environments. Those seeking authenticity might prefer excursions to living  
history attractions or archeological sites or digs, visits to artists’ studios, bird  
watching or whale watching tours, ecological tours, and other programs that  
provide an in-depth or hands-on exploration of the culture or environment.  
For example, coordinating a GPS scavenger hunt could provide an entertaining  
way for participants to become more familiar with a location and its landmarks.  
Depending on the results of the market research, you may wish to organize  
special excursions to attractions relevant to a common hobby or special interest,  
such as agricultural or horticultural facilities, aviaries, apiaries, technical institutes,  
and other points of specialized interest. Perhaps an expert on a specific topic can  
be engaged to give a demonstration or presentation in conjunction with the tour  
to provide a more enriching or educational dimension to the excursion.  
Learning Journeys  
A learning journey or educational field trip may be a component of the main  
event for attendees and may also be of interest to accompanying persons. Such  
tours and activities are often conducted to acquaint participants with the physi-  
cal plant, operations, and/or capabilities of a commercial or industrial facility  
or entity. These include factory tours, back-of-the-house tours, backstage tours,  
tours of government facilities, sports facilities, or any other facility pertinent to  
the purpose of the main event. The professional event coordinator should work Optional Tours and Trips  
261  
with the host facility to design an itinerary that is safe, efficient, and educational.  
The host facility should provide a knowledgeable and engaging escort who is able  
to provide expert commentary and answer questions.  
These excursions should be designed to be entertaining as well as educational.  
You can conduct a chef’s table event in the kitchen to introduce a group to a  
restaurant operation, conduct a narrated walking tour to acquaint the group with  
the physical plant of an industrial facility, or conduct a hands-on demonstration  
to allow the group to experience the mechanics of a manufacturing operation.  
You must remember the principles of adult learning, particularly that adults prefer  
interactive learning environments and approach learning from a problem-solving  
point of view.  
Selecting a Professional Provider  
Maximize your time investment in coordinating optional tours by selecting  
a professional tour operator to provide such services. It might be possible to  
secure these services through a DMC or PCO, and it might be advantageous  
to use the same company providing the ground transportation needed for the  
event itself. It is important to make certain that the provider has the experience,  
equipment, and capacity to deliver a quality product for a group; you might  
even take the tour yourself to make an appraisal.  
Many tour operators also offer commissionable rates for group bookings, often  
5 to 10 percent of the retail tour price, which could offset certain administrative  
costs. You must confirm the minimums required, booking deadlines, and cancel-  
lation policies and procedures for undersubscribed tours. You must also confirm that  
any tour provider selected has all the appropriate licenses and insurance coverage.  
Although any recreational event has elements of risk, some are riskier than others.  
You must always investigate any liability issues regarding an activity offered  
or endorsed by the event organization, as well as confirm the reliability of the  
provider, ensure that appropriate safety measures are employed, and secure the  
appropriate waivers of indemnification from participants.

INSIGHT 262 Ancillary Programs  
/ TRTAS BE iy Ss Ste ee ee —N  
| One such program was for a pharmaceutical company’s top performers  
| held in Reykjavik, Iceland, with the theme “Country of Contrasts.” Guests  
enjoyed different activities such as snorkeling, exploring underground caves, i  
touring glaciers, horseback riding and snowmobiling, visiting museums  
| and galleries, and traditional Icelandic dining in a fishing village. The final  
gala dinner, held at the Hilton Reykjavik Nordica, celebrated the scenery,  
| people, folklore, and culture of Iceland.  
As with any program of this caliber, there are challenges; however, this  
| program encountered a unique one\: the meltdown of Iceland’s economy.  
The economic crisis involved the collapse of all three of the country’s major  
banks following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a  
run on deposits in the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy,  
Iceland’s banking collapse was the largest suffered by any country in eco- |  
nomic history. Conducting business in a bankrupt country amidst financial  
turmoil, paired with the significant amount of negative press around the  
j  
|  
world, led to one of the most significant challenges Harith Productions Ltd.  
had ever faced.  
As soon as the economic disaster was shown on the news, the client  
and attendees became extremely concerned about the program. “The cli-  
ent contacted us about the reality of the problems of Iceland and if the  
program should be held there with respect to the extreme circumstances.  
Our client's foremost concern was whether the infrastructure of the coun-  
try would be in full working condition. They were fearful that the group  
would arrive in Iceland to find the restaurants, shops, tour operators, etc.,  
had gone out of business.”  
After hearing the client's concerns, it was imperative that Harith contact  
the major players involved in the program, as well as government officials,  
to learn the facts about the situation in Iceland, and ascertain the extent  
to which the pharmaceutical client would be affected. It was of utmost  
importance that upon their arrival in Iceland, the attendees would not have  
a negative perception of the country. It was necessary to consider a last-  
minute change in location to another country.  
The client was not the only one that was concerned about the country’s  
stability. The sales team at the Hilton Reykjavik was nervous that the percep-  
tion of Iceland in the public eye would make the pharmaceutical client choose  
another destination. After all of the hard work and collaboration the Hilton  
| Reykjavik and Practical Destination Management Company had done with  
Harith Productions Ltd., they were adamant that coming to Iceland would  
be a wonderful opportunity and would not disappoint. Optional Tours and Trips 263  
Not only did Harith Productions reach out to its direct team in Iceland,  
| including the sales force from the Hilton Reykjavik, senior executives from  
IcelandAir, and the president of the Icelandic DMC but also, Wickrema  
decided it was imperative to speak with those working directly with the Ice-  
| landic government. “We spoke with the embassy of Iceland to the United  
| States, the first secretary of the embassy of Iceland, and the secretary for  
the consulate. After speaking with all of these people, we were assured that  
\: traveling to Iceland even during an economic crisis would still be an amazing  
experience for the attendees.’  
| After informing the client of all of the information received from those in  
Iceland, it was decided to continue with the program as planned. To reassure  
the attendees that the program was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experi-  
ence, an e-mail blast was sent out to the winners depicting colorful pho-  
tos of pure, fantastic Iceland, further creating anticipation for the trip. Harith  
i Productions Ltd. also called every single winner to share their experience  
and the support of the government and the team from the Hilton Corpora-  
| tion, as well as answer any questions if they had concerns.  
Wickrema said, “To say this was a challenge is an understatement.’  
Unlike the challenges Harith Productions Ltd. usually encounters when  
producing incentive meetings, it was sailing in uncharted waters dealing with  
“a bankrupt economy, the wildly fluctuating foreign exchange situation,  
and negative press.” He personally requested the support of the office  
of the prime minister or the president of Iceland. Wickrema also flew to  
Iceland and met with the key stakeholders of the government, hotel, and  
DMC to discuss new ways to expand the experience for the client to be  
truly unique and experiential, going to great lengths to show the stake-  
holders in Iceland that he fully supported both them and their country.  
Although this challenge proved to be extremely difficult, in the end a  
i great bond was formed that would have not happened otherwise. In  
fact, Wickrema was extended a tremendous honor due to his ongoing  
support; he was invited to the official residence of the president of Iceland.  
In the end, the program was fantastic and the attendees were not affected  
negatively by the economy. And as a capstone to it all, the vendor partners  
were able to share full credit and recognition when this program was awarded  
the highest honor in the incentive industry, the SITE \(Society of Incentive  
Travel Executives\) Crystal Award, as well as a Special Events Gala Award for  
the final gala dinner at the Hilton Reykjavik. 264 Ancillary Programs  
# Mini-Events  
Mini-events are those events held in conjunction with a main event that could be  
considered stand-alone events in another context. These include certain hospi-  
tality functions, exhibits, energizers, icebreakers, charitable projects, fundraising  
programs, parades, and promotional events. They may be optional activities or  
integral parts of the overall event experience. The professional event coordinator could  
be called on to organize special events for special occasions such as a birthday or  
anniversary celebration for a CEO ora particular attendee, a private reception for  
certain dignitaries, or even a wedding ceremony at a sports event. Each mini-event  
requires the same comprehensive approach to research, design, planning, coordi-  
nation, and evaluation as the main event, and must be fully integrated into the  
logistical and budgetary operations of the main event.  
Hospitality Functions  
Hospitality functions are held in conjunction with a main event to promote  
interaction and facilitate special recognition. The professional event coordina-  
tor may have to organize or accommodate a variety of hospitality events, desks,  
lounges, and/or suites that provide gathering places for special interest groups  
within the main event's audience. A special event or area might be developed to  
recognize and entertain international delegates to a conference, individuals who  
have achieved a specific certification, members of a fraternal or affinity organi-  
zation, or sponsors and dignitaries associated with the main event. Dine-around  
events could be organized to allow attendees to sample the local cuisine while  
meeting and getting to know other attendees in a social setting. Dine-around  
events involve making reservations at area restaurants, using a registration  
mechanism to randomly create parties of eight to ten guests for each restaurant,  
and organizing transportation to and from the restaurants \(e.g., shuttle service  
route or taxi service\).  
Special Exhibits and Exhibitions  
Special exhibits at an event can include anything from tabletop displays in a  
common area to tablescapes created for a design competition. Exhibitions may  
include anything from a juried art show to a full-fledged exposition, defined  
by Morrow \(1997, 12, 56\) as “a temporary, time-sensitive marketplace orga-  
nized by an individual or corporation, where buyer and seller interact for the  
express purpose of purchasing displayed goods or services, either at the time of  
presentation or at a future date.” Morrow reports that, according to the Center  
for Exhibition Industry Research \(CEIR\), the functions of an exposition include Mini-Events  
265  
“buying, selling, new product introduction, media coverage, gaining competi-  
tive intelligence, updating industry developments and trends, and networking  
and problem solving.”  
These exhibits and expositions add an informative and interactive dimension  
to a main event, perhaps displaying the history of an organization, the newest  
technological advances, indigenous attractions and attributes of a destination,  
or the entries in an awards competition. You might need to coordinate a poster  
session wherein the papers or reports on a topic are displayed and their authors  
and/or researchers are present to discuss the contents with interested persons.  
You might wish to set up a small crafts market featuring demonstrations by  
local or ethnic artists and craftspersons adjacent to your main event so that  
the audience can interact, learn, and shop without leaving your event site. The  
spatial and equipment needs for these special displays must be incorporated  
into your site plan so that they are effectively accessible and enhance rather than  
impede the traffic patterns and flow.  
When trade shows, expos, or fairs are the main event careful attention  
must be paid to the rights and responsibilities for the exhibitors. These  
include such things as how exhibit space will be assigned \(e.g., first paid/  
first choice, previous participation point system, etc.\); the rules of conduct  
for exhibitors \(permitted and prohibited activities\); and display guidelines  
and restrictions. Given that the exhibit space is temporary “commercial real  
estate” partitioned off with minimal physical barriers, exhibition rules and  
regulations need to be devised that ensure each exhibitor can expect  
\(and will provide\) equitable and undisturbed interaction with customers in  
a safe, secure, and noncompetitive environment.  
Charitable Projects  
Many events incorporate a charitable component into the overall program to  
add a meaningful dimension to the purpose of the event and to communicate a  
message of care and goodwill by the event's hosting organization. Sometimes an  
event conducts a fundraising drive during its operation or undertakes a chari-  
table project as a component of the event itself. Visiting sports teams, delegates,  
or dignitaries might be involved in a one-day project to build a playground,  
refurbish a community center, or clean up a city park. A local festival might  
collect coats for kids, or a marketing event might collect canned goods for  
a food drive. This philanthropic affiliation may be a long-standing relation-  
ship between organizations or adopted based on the needs of the community  
in which the event takes place. You can check with local agencies such as the  
United Way to determine projects suitable for a specific event. 266 Ancillary Programs  
Creative Energizers  
Many events may benefit from strategies to energize the proceedings and pro-  
mote interaction. A broad variety of devices can be employed to enhance the  
event theme and increase participation, from themed refreshment breaks to daily  
puzzle-solving contests. Numerous board games and other games such as bingo,  
Monopoly, and Trivial Pursuit might be used or adapted to create fun icebreakers  
and energizers. Icebreakers offer an audience of attendees who are not familiar  
with each other an entertaining activity that facilitates introductions and inter-  
action, and they can be designed to incorporate the theme of the main event. For  
a Wild West or casino theme, you might play human poker, giving each guest a  
playing card with instructions to find four other people with cards that will create  
a winning poker hand; for a Hollywood or film festival theme, you might hand  
out buttons with movie stars’ photos on them and have people find the casts of  
famous movies. Numerous electronic badge technologies such as Pathable \(www  
.pathable.com\), Spotme \(www.spotme.com\), Badge2 Match \(www.badge2match  
.com\), and others may be used to help attendees find those of similar interests  
and “high-value networking potential” \(Vanneste 2008, 66\).  
Promotional Events and Parades  
Promotional events are incorporated into many marketing plans for events. These  
usually take place prior to the main event to boost ticket sales and increase attendance,  
but they may also be conducted during an event to promote specific event elements.  
You might have a cook-off, a contest, a stunt, a book signing, a bonfire, or a celebrity  
appearance. These events must be conducted in a timely manner to achieve their mar-  
keting objectives and require special attention to any risk management issues. After all,  
an accident or disaster is not the marketing message you mean to send.  
Parades are events that promote a main event, communicate a message, and  
encourage participation. From pet parades to protest marches, or a parade of athletes  
to a parade of fantastic floats, these movable and moving displays have traditionally  
been used to promote everything from the circus coming to town \(originally tak-  
ing advantage of the mechanism for moving the animals and equipment from the  
railway station or town entrance to the event grounds\) to demonstrating a country’s  
military might. They are now also used to rally affinity or celebrate diversity, as well  
as bring audience and event together in an entertaining manner.  
The professional event coordinator may have responsibility for organizing  
these ancillary mini-events or may need to work with committees or independent  
producers to integrate them into the overall event plans. It is important to be very  
careful about controlling ad hoc or impromptu mini-events that take place in  
conjunction with a main event, because they will be connected with that event  
in the minds of the audience and can affect your ability to efficiently and effectively  
coordinate the main event. Mini-Events 267

D.C. “Chip” Baker, executive director of the Riverbend Festival \(www.river- bendfestival.com\) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Sallie Beckes, the festival’s  
former marketing director, contend that relationships and partnerships are primary keys to the festival’s continued survival for more than 30  
years. Baker says, “Relationships are crucial because they impact every |  
aspect of your operation. From staff, to board, to sponsors, to volunteers,  
to politicians, to foundation support, to media, and all the way down to  
your patrons.’ Most large events receive subsidies from their city, county,  
or State, or they receive in-kind services \(police, EMS, waste management\).  
Baker notes, “We receive city and county services, which have a significant i  
impact on our bottom line. This success is a two-way street; we receive ser-  
vices and the city/county receives a major economic impact from festival  
revenue generated for our community. A recent Encore study through the  
International Festival and Events Association \(IFEA\) showed a dramatic |  
\$29.1 million economic impact that Riverbend has on the community.’  
The Riverbend Festival, located in downtown Chattanooga, stretches over |  
a mile in length. In 2005, the downtown area completed a \$120 million renais-  
sance, and some businesses did not like the fact that traffic patterns were  
altered for 19 days each year.“A key relationship and partnership for the River-

H  
i  
bend Festival is working with our downtown businesses, which are situated  
on the ‘front porch’ of our event. Being a downtown event, it is important for  
these businesses to partner with us.” Communication is crucial in this process.  
Being a constant presence and listening to concerns or comments helped  
immeasurably in strengthening relationships and fostering confidence, and  
resulted in the development of programs to help surrounding businesses  
| before and during the festival, including\:  
i  
e Eat-n-Greet—The festival arranges for musicians to come to various  
|  
businesses, usually a restaurant, to perform. “We promote these peri-  
| phery events with the intent of the free performance driving business  
| into their establishments.’ The first few years of this program there were  
only a handful of restaurants that chose to be involved. However, after  
successful Eat-n-Greet events occurred, it has become a valued opportu-  
nity with a waiting list.  
e TheBend Unplugged—This opportunity requiresa setting likeamuseum,  
concert hall or, in this case, an aquarium theater. In this type venue, artists  
not only perform but discuss with the audience the creative process  
of their music composition. “Some venues charge admission and they

receive the revenue. Our intent is to make the artists available to them  
and they are given the opportunity to make it successful, with our  
guidance and promotions.”  
Baker notes that the future success of the Riverbend Festival requires  
continued efforts. “Partnerships and relationships constantly change as  
people come and go. This is the way of the world. However, who you know  
and how you develop these relationships is an invaluable component in  
the event equation.”  
The Sporting Life  
The professional event coordinator might be required to arrange or incorporate  
sports activities into an event as an entertainment option, to facilitate interaction  
and relationship building, to promote healthy competition, or to accommodate  
the desire to participate in recreational activities as part of a healthy lifestyle.  
You might be selecting spectator or participatory activities, organizing tournaments  
and competitions, coordinating teambuilding programs, or identifying recre-  
ational sports activities and facilities \(such as exercise gymnasiums\) available at  
the destination \(see Figure 9.4\).  
These activities must be selected based on the interests, age, and fitness levels  
of the audience and integrated into the event schedule so they do not exhaust the  
attendees before an important component of the main event program. You must  
make certain that the venue is appropriate and well maintained, has the necessary  
facilities such as changing or locker rooms \(including showers, towels, etc., if  
appropriate\), includes access to or rents the necessary equipment, and ensures  
that the appropriate supervision or facilitation of the activity is provided.  
Spectator and Participatory Events  
Spectator sports activities could include an exhibition game of stunt/display teams  
or athletes, admissions to local or concurrent competitions, or play-offs featuring  
division or department heads and the CEO and other upper-management members.  
The professional event coordinator should also consider incorporating a spectator  
component into a participatory sports activity or tournament so that those not par-  
ticipating can watch and cheer the action from the grandstands or the sidelines. The Sporting Life

Participatory athletic activities can include any sport imaginable organized for  
pure recreation or serious competition. You might arrange for a miniature golf  
course to be laid out in an exposition hall or along the passageways between  
meeting rooms at a convention. You might set up billiard tables in a hospitality  
lounge or schedule races on motorized beer kegs. You might wish to include a  
fun run for joggers or a laser skeet-shooting competition for marksmen. Softball  
and volleyball are popular at picnics, skiing and snowmobiling can be popular at  
snowbound destinations, rugby and football games may be more popular during  
the professional sports’ seasons, and “extreme sports” such as stunt skateboarding  
and in-line skating are popular with younger attendees. Sports clinics of all types  
can offer participants a chance to improve their games or offer novices a chance to  
try a sport they have never tried before.  
Tournaments and Competitions  
The two most often produced tournaments in the context of a conference or cor-  
porate event are golf and tennis \(many incentive events include golf as a primary  
component\), but the professional event coordinator could be called on to organize  
tournaments and competitions for any number of sporting activities, from road  
rallies to tricycle races. This effort can include securing the proper venue, judges  
and/or referees, the appropriate equipment, transportation, registration and  
player matching, refreshments, and prizes ranging from ribbons, medals, trophies,  
or perpetual trophies \(those that stay with the winning team until the next  
competition\) to souvenir merchandise and sport-specific gifts.  
269  
Figure 9.4  
Typical Sports Activities 270 Ancillary Programs  
The type of tournament offered will depend on the sport, the time allotted  
for play, the facilities available for play, and the number of players participating.  
The type of tournament sometimes depends on the seriousness of the competi-  
tion and/or the value of the prize to be won \(which might require specific entry  
policies, scoring regulations, and tie-breaking procedures\). John Byl \(1990\)  
identifies the standard tournament types as follows\:  
\* Single elimination—Losers are eliminated and winners advance to the  
next round.  
\* Multilevel—Losers move successively to second or third brackets, playing  
concurrently to determine winners in different classes.  
\* Round robin—All entrants play each other, and the cumulative scores  
determine winners.  
¢ Extended—Entrants challenge players ranked above them to make their  
way to the top level \(may include such types as ladder, pyramid, crown,  
spiderweb, and level rotation tournaments\).  
Also consider different divisions, such as men’s singles, women’s singles, dou-  
bles, mixed doubles, junior/senior players, and player caliber categories such as  
novice, intermediate, and advanced.  
Even if you know how to playa specific sport, that does not mean you are qualified  
\(or will have the time\) to organize a tournament or competition. Many sports  
venues such as resort properties, clubs, courts, and courses have experienced in-  
house professionals who can coordinate a fair and evenly matched competition,  
as well as secure the proper scoring/referee officials and appropriate equipment.  
Another possibility is to contact athletic programs at local schools, universities,  
or recreational departments for assistance. There are also commercial ventures  
offering recreational and team-building programs such as sailing regattas, zany  
games, and even sand castle sculpture competitions.  
Matching Skills and Entertainment  
Sports activities and programs should be entertaining as well as challenging. For  
a game to be fun, it must be fair and the skill levels of the players should be  
comparable. Morrow \(1997, 390-391\) advises that when you are conducting  
activities or tournaments in which individuals or teams will play against one  
another, you should ask for information on years played, handicap levels, average  
scores, tournaments won, and so on, to ensure that the levels of competency  
match. The structure of the sports activity or program should allow for all levels  
of ability in order to be accessible and inclusive. You might wish to include  
entertainment options, such as a putting green obstacle course at a golf tourna-  
ment or sport-specific/themed inflatable games for the nonaficionado or non-  
playing attendees or accompanying persons. The Sporting Life  
271  
Prepare participants by including a full description of the activities offered and  
the equipment options available \(bring-your-own or rental specifics\) and recom-  
mending the appropriate attire. If teams are to be formed, you might need to order  
uniforms or colored team T-shirts for participants. You might have to send out  
a survey to gather ranking information or advise potential participants to bring  
specific certification or documentation of capabilities \(e.g., scuba diving certifica-  
tions\). You might need to send out the tournament rules, tie-breaking procedures,  
and playing schedule. You might need to specify certain equipment regulations  
or send out preregistration forms and participant waivers of indemnity. You must  
specify the conditions that would cause changes in or cancellation of a particular  
activity, because someone may decide to attend the main event just because it  
includes this golf course or that recreational option, and if it is not available, could  
dispute the “contractual agreement” stipulated by the event brochure.  
Teambuilding Dynamics  
Teambuilding activities are often incorporated into corporate and other events  
and are used to move from breaking the ice to bonding, bringing diverse indi-  
viduals together to achieve a common goal and overcome challenges that require  
cooperative efforts. They could include sports-based activities, adventure-based  
activities, simulated physical challenges, problem-solving missions, invented sit-  
uations, or team projects. You might havea road rally or vehicular obstacle course, a  
ropes course or paintball war, an indoor or outdoor rock- or tower-climbing  
challenge. You might have teams build a raft out of recycled materials or develop  
a video documentary, or strand team members \(metaphorically\) on a deserted  
island or on another planet. You could convene an espionage academy or stage  
a murder mystery, or challenge teams to design a working robot or write a song.  
Although teambuilding events are often designed to result in recognizing  
a winner, they are not simply competitions. They must be designed to fulfill a  
purpose and address specific objectives \(see Figure 9.5\). David Peters, owner  
of Absolute Amusements, based in Orlando, Florida, describes his company’s  
approach to teambuilding as finding effective goals and accomplishing those  
goals \(Michaels 2002\). “We try to look at a company’s needs and solve a problem  
in a certain area, whether it’s motivation, trust, communication or a number of  
other areas. Most times, there is more than one area a teambuilding event needs  
to solve.” Peters also notes, “Fun definitely increases retention.”  
Teambuilding events should be customized to the corporate culture and incor-  
porate the corporation's branding within the theme, activities, and setting. They  
require a strong facilitator, an emotionally and physically safe environment, the  
proper selection and sequence of activities, and a way for everyone to partici-  
pate and contribute \(not everyone will be physically or emotionally able to do  
everything, because of personal limitations—i.e., disabilities, back problems, 272

pregnancy, phobias, etc.\). A teambuilding event should include a debriefing  
session focusing on the skills and techniques used during the event as well as a  
follow-up application or transfer to the workplace, such as setting goals, imple-  
menting objectives, monitoring progress, and management's reinforcement of  
the teambuilding experience after the event.  
Safety and Liability Considerations  
As with all recreational activities, but particularly in regard to sports activities,  
you must consider the risk management issues and liabilities associated with such  
event-related programs. You must make certain that the appropriate insurance coy-  
erage is in place for both the event organization and the entity producing the sports  
activity. You must arrange for the appropriate level of first aid and/or on-site medi-  
cal facilities \(it is advised that for any strenuous activity you have an emergency  
medical technician \(EMT\) on-site\). You must make certain that the playing site is  
safe and the appropriate protective measures are in place \(e.g., padded poles and/or  
flooring, chalk or talc field marking instead of lime, etc.\). You must ensure that the  
equipment is in good condition and appropriate \(e.g., regulation balls, regulation  
heights, well-anchored supports, etc.\) and that the participants are equipped with  
the proper protective gear \(e.g., life vests, helmets, padding, etc.\).  
Other considerations include securing the appropriate permissions and  
waivers of indemnity from participants. Note that signed waivers will not protect  
you from negligent behavior. Participation in sports activities should be a pleasur-  
able and rewarding experience. However, participation must never be mandatory,  
either implicitly or explicitly. As a professional event coordinator, you must always  
consider options for different levels of participation and/or inclusion as a specta-  
tor so that everyone at the main event will enjoy and benefit from the ancillary  
sports event. Wrap Up  
273  
Wrap Up  
Ancillary events held in conjunction with a main event must have a purpose  
and should be selected based on the needs and objectives of the main event.  
Companion programs are included to occupy and entertain guests’ guests or  
accompanying persons. They may include indulgent services, self-improvement  
opportunities, or enriching activities. Scheduling must complement the main  
event, neither interfering nor conflicting with an attendee’s participation in or  
obligations to the main event program. Special care must be exercised in organizing  
children’s programs and child care facilities.  
\_ Optional sightseeing tours and pre- or postevent tour packages offer opportu-  
nities to take full advantage of an event destination. They should highlight and  
offer access to indigenous and unique cultural, environmental, and entertainment  
attractions. \[hey can become part of the purchase decision for the main event  
and provide the mechanism to enhance and extend the main event experience.  
Mini-events, from parades to special exhibits, are often held in conjunction with  
a main event to enhance, promote, and/or create added value for the main event.  
They may be educational, recreational, promotional, charitable, or interactive.  
Whether planned or impromptu, mini-events will be connected with the main  
event in the audience’s mind, so they must be carefully controlled to ensure that  
the proper message is communicated and that they serve the goals and objectives  
of the main event.  
Sporting activities are included in an event to provide recreation and healthy  
competition for participants seeking adventure, athletics, or amusement. The  
professional event coordinator may need to arrange participatory and/or spec-  
tator options and opportunities for attendees and accompanying persons.  
Tournaments need organization, which should be delegated to professionals  
with experience in the specific sport. Teambuilding activities are popular mech-  
anisms for achieving specific growth objectives and should be both challenging  
and entertaining.  
All ancillary activities must be impeccably coordinated and carefully considered,  
from a risk management perspective, in regard to liability and safety issues, proper  
insurance coverage, and professional providers. Participation in these activities  
and mini-events should never be mandatory, but should be designed to attract and  
include participants of various abilities and demographics.

We need all sorts of nourishment.  
——Cat Stevens, British musician  
I will admit itx—I’m a glutton; not just in a girth-gifted context \(although that is  
applicable\), but as a seeker of more, an enthusiast for plenty of all things that  
nourish our bodies and souls. We hunger not only for food, but for recognition,  
celebration, and the moments that make our lives more satisfying.  
There are many basic human needs that must be addressed in the design and  
coordination of an event, the first of which is food and drink. Physical sustenance  
is required for life, but what and the ways in which it is provided will have a pro-  
found effect on the real and perceived quality of the event experience. Emotional  
sustenance is also required, identified in the third and fourth tier of Maslow’s  
hierarchy of needs\: belonging and esteem. Plentiful opportunities to make the  
event experience more significant are available here as well.  
The following two chapters explore the ways in which we can satisfy not only  
the physical and emotional needs of those attending our events, but also how we  
can ensure these choices will be more nourishing and thereby, more meaningful  
and memorable.

Food and Beverage  
# Operations  
Been BEA De LED J rye .  
—Kendalt Collier, CSEP American catering executive  
In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
e Identify the food and beverage needs of the audience, participants,  
staff, and other stakeholders at an event.  
e Determine and procure the appropriate purveyors, products, and  
service providers for the catering needs of the event.  
e Select nutritional menus that meet the budgetary requirements of  
the event and incorporate the necessary dietary restrictions, cultural  
preferences, and thematic considerations.  
e Coordinate the food and beverage service style, sites, and schedule  
in accordance with the needs of the event and applicable licensing,  
health, and safety regulations.  
279 he event coordinator had been working with the chairperson of a fundraising com-  
mittee to design an elegant gala event to attract new sponsors and donors for a  
charity organization. The chairperson was adamant about using an expensive new  
. restaurant, at which she had dined, to do the catering because it was “the talk of the town.’  
The restaurant, however, had never catered an off-premise event before. Despite the event  
coordinators advice to secure proposals from numerous caterers, the committee acqui-  
\~— esced to the chairperson. Later, the event coordinator overheard two guests discussing  
"Oh well, the average person has more than 40,000 meals in a lifetime. | can live  
Oe ee ee a ee ee ee ee ee ee  
Food and beverages may be an integral or tangential component of an event, but  
they are the primary focus of many events. They can make or break an event, or, if  
not selected properly, can fail to fulfill the aspirations of an event. The professional  
event coordinator must understand the function of food and beverage within the  
purpose of the event in order to meet and exceed expectations while fulfilling  
the nutritional needs and preferences of those being served. From a chocolate  
extravaganza at a fundraising event, to candied apples at a harvest festival, gourmet  
box lunches for a sightseeing tour, or a seven-course banquet honoring a visiting  
head of state, the right food service can facilitate the achievement of an event’s  
goals and objectives.  
Margaret Visser \(1991, 2\) states\:  
We play with food, show off with it, revere and disdain it. The main rules about eat-  
ing are simple\: If you do not eat you die; and no matter how large your dinner, you  
will soon be hungry again. Precisely because we must both eat and keep on eating,  
human beings have poured enormous effort into making food more than itself, so  
that it bears manifold meanings beyond its primary purpose of physical nutrition.  
Eating and drinking are necessary and should be pleasurable for people,  
whether they are grabbing a snack or dining in style.  
The professional event coordinator must first determine the functional needs  
of food service\:  
\* Who must be fed—attendee/stakeholder groups, how many, demographics  
\* Why they must be fed—sustenance, energy, attentiveness, hydration,  
refreshment Catering Operations  
281  
° What they must be fed—meal type, special diets, variety, nutrition, budget  
\* When they must be fed—time, position within program, speed of food service,  
trickle/dump arrival  
\* Where they must be fed—on/off-premise, meeting room, tent, backstage,  
break area, sit-down, standing, strolling  
The professional event coordinator must then determine the creative options  
available to fulfill these needs and the catering operations to provide the food  
and beverages in an attractive, efficient, and cost-effective manner. It is critical to  
ensure that the food and beverage service is sufficient, sanitary, and safe and that it  
complies with all applicable regulations.  
Catering Operations  
The role and scope of catering at an event will be based on the type, purpose,  
scope, and objectives of the event. The professional event coordinator may be  
selecting a variety of menus for a multiday conference in a convention center or  
hotel, a dinner for a wedding celebration held on a private estate, food vendors  
for a festival, participants in a cook-off competition, refreshments for a hospital-  
ity reception, breakfast for participants after a charity fun run, or a picnic for  
a reunion. The type of caterer or food service operation used might be an in-  
house department at the venue or an independent provider at an off-premise loca-  
tion, and there are often policies and procedures specific to each type. You must  
research the options and select the provider that is best able to offer the menus,  
prices, and experience to meet the specific needs of the event.  
Determine the Function of Food Service  
Food service, like form, follows function. The types of food and beverage served  
will be determined by the functions they are to fulfill \(see Figure 10.1\), and the  
way in which food and beverages are served can facilitate the function the event

is meant to serve. Meals such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner are meant to satisfy  
hunger, but not all events require a sit-down meal. For example, at a conference,  
you might have a stand-up continental-style breakfast with bite-size pastries, fruit  
kebobs, miniature quiches, and tiny cups with a sundae of granola and yogurt  
adorned with a plastic spoon, which allows attendees to graze while mingling  
before the first session. Lunch at a car show might consist of gourmet wrap sand-  
wiches and pizza sold at food concessions, which might increase attendance dur-  
ing the midday hours of the exhibit. Dinner might be served at different venues  
during a multivenue progressive feast. Between-meal refreshments are often added  
to ensure that energy levels are maintained and that attendees remain on-site.  
It is important to ascertain which internal and external groups \(or customers\)  
require food service \(see Figure 10.2\) and when. Some of these groups might not  
have complimentary food and beverages provided by the event; rather, food and  
beverage service might have to be identified or procured, from which these individ-  
uals can purchase meals and snacks. Whether the event is providing food service or  
not, the same attention to quality, quantity, and cost should be considered. If you  
are arranging purchasable meals for staff, crews, and participants, the food service  
provider's access to the event site must be factored into the event plan. Catering  
specifications in entertainers’ riders must be incorporated into the requests for  
proposals. Separate and less costly meals might have to be ordered for personnel  
such as the drivers who have transported your guests to an off-premise event.  
Separate and more extravagant menus might be required for VIP or corporate  
hospitality areas. Volunteers and the media always appreciate refreshments.  
Specify the meals and other refreshments to be provided, including breakfasts,  
lunches, dinners, breaks, snacks, and/or beverage service \(including water stations\),  
and the time when each should be provided. Determine if and which food services  
are to be profit centers for the event. Identify any special dietary needs of various  
internal or external groups, including specific nutritional requirements, special  
food types or brand stipulations, rider specifications, foods to avoid, hydration  
needs, and price points. Estimate the number of participants or individuals to  
be served for each type of food service. Establish your budget parameters. Then  
research and select the best catering operation to meet each group’s needs.

Types and Scope of Catering Operations  
Food preparation and food service are two distinct activities, and where these activi-  
ties take place determines the type of catering operation. In-house \(or on-premise\)  
catering operations have on-site kitchens that service the facility in which they are  
housed. Off-premise caterers have a commissary \(kitchen facility\) where the food  
is prepared, which is then transported to where the food service will take place,  
and where finish cooking may also occur. Take-out \(or take-away\) caterers have a  
food preparation kitchen, and either the customers pick up the prepared platters  
or dishes, or the caterer will deliver them and leave. There is considerable compe-  
tition among these types of catering operations for the various markets, including  
events, but you must determine whether the catering operation seeking the event’s  
business is truly able to meet the needs of the specific event.  
Off-premise events, those held at a site or venue that does not have an in-house  
catering department, require a different food service approach because of the  
nature of temporary or limited food preparation facilities. Independent caterers  
and mobile caterers \(those with preparation and serving equipment in a self-contained  
vehicle\) are able to provide food service in almost any location imaginable, and some  
independent catering operations also hold the contracts for canteens and cafeterias  
in various venues. Concessionaires often offer preprepared, specialty, or limited  
food services from the side or back of a truck, such as those found at construction  
sites, or food stands and outlets at fairs and festivals or within stadiums or arenas.  
You must confirm that any catering operation seeking to service an off-premise  
event understands the operational difficulties and differences between on- and  
off-premise food service—there is a big difference between carrying dinners across  
a hall and transporting them across town, and between serving 500 gourmet meals  
over the course of an evening and serving them all at the same time.  
Both Ginger Kramer of Classic World Events, Inc., in San Jose, California, and  
Steve Kemble of Steve Kemble Event Design in Dallas, Texas, strongly recom-  
mend visiting a caterer’s operation prior to contracting. Kramer advocates look-  
ing at the toilet facilities. “If they are sparkling clean, the operation as a whole is  
likely to be well run; if they are messy, you should have doubts about the quality  
of the company’s practices and products. If the toilet facilities are filthy, get out  
of there immediately!”  
Kemble advises you to prequalify a caterer through a telephone interview,  
then visit with the caterer at his or her shop, review the portfolio, and tour the  
kitchens. He also likes to, if at all possible, visit the caterer while on-site setting  
continues

INSIGHT 284 Food and Beverage Operations  
up for an actual event. “You can get a good idea of their organizational skills  
and a feel for how well their staff works.” Kemble also notes that although a  
caterer might not be right for a particular job, you should keep its name as  
a resource to consider for other events. “Not every caterer is right for every  
single event. One may do very well with a cocktail reception of 1,000 people  
but absolutely cannot do a seated dinner for 300.”  
Selecting and Contracting Caterers  
Select the caterer that is able to handle the particular specifications for the event to  
be held. With approximately 53,000 caterers, excluding hotels, listed in the U.S.  
Yellow Pages \(www.catersource.com\), for example, your options should be plenti-  
ful. You will consider the available menus, the specialized menus offered for your  
event, the caterer’s experience with events similar to yours, its personnel, and the  
prices, including gratuities, service charges, and taxes. Get references and check  
them thoroughly. You might also wish to schedule a tasting to sample the dishes  
proposed for your event to confirm the presentation and flavor.  
You should be familiar with the standard catering contract policies in order to  
negotiate and execute the proper agreement. Information from the contract will  
be transferred to the Banquet Event Order \(BEO\), an internal document used  
by the catering staff listing the menu, setup, and other details for the function.  
A catering contract typically includes the following components.  
\* Day\(s\) and date\(s\) of the event—Including both the day and the date will  
clarify any mistakes regarding when the event is to take place. The day of  
the week sometimes influences the pricing based on supply and demand.  
\* Starting, ending, and serving times—The caterer needs to know exactly  
how food service fits into the overall event program in order to calculate  
setup, clearing, and other costs.  
\* Location of the event— The specific site, including the room or space, might  
affect the setup, preparation, and cleanup costs, particularly for off-premise  
venues with limited or difficult access.  
¢ Number of guests—Used to calculate pricing and quantities to be ordered.  
Pricing is based on the cost of the foodstuffs, labor, overhead, and profit.  
There are certain per-person economies of scale that are calculated into the  
final costing and pricing, which may fluctuate if attendance increases or  
decreases. The caterer and the client should agree on how the final head  
count \(the number actually served\) will be determined \(e.g., tickets, counter,  
number of rolled napkins with flatware used, etc.\). Catering Operations  
285  
Date for final guarantee— Usually 48 to 72 hours before the event; specifies  
the number of meals the caterer agrees to prepare and the client agrees to  
pay for whether served or not. Guarantees are estimates, often calculated  
according to such factors as the history of the event, registration or reply  
counts, or comparable events.  
Minimum number of guests—Because of volume pricing, this number rep-  
resents the fewest meals the caterer will provide at the prices quoted. If the  
final guarantee goes below this number \(usually 5 to 7 percent\), the caterer  
may reserve the right to increase the per-person price.  
Charges for additional guests— The per-person price can be increased if more  
than the final guaranteed number of meals is required. Most caterers prepare  
for 3 to 5 percent over the final guarantee, but increases beyond that will likely  
incur charges for special foodstuff orders and increased labor costs.  
Food and beverages selected—An itemized menu specifying the quanti-  
ties, quality, and brand-name products if stipulated. If certain food items  
or products are subject to a price change because of increased costs \(due  
to availability, seasonality, or span of time between the contract and the  
event\), the caterer will stipulate the probable limits of a percentage increase  
in price. The caterer should also stipulate how substitutions in product or  
venue will be handled.  
Staffing levels—Certain styles of service require more waitstaff than others,  
and certain clients desire more waitstaff than the minimum levels. In addi-  
tion, many independent or off-premise caterers specify the number of staff  
and their hours, both front of house \(FOH\) and back of house \(BOH\), as  
a separate line item to differentiate between the costs for the food and the  
costs for the labor. This item might also include the uniform or attire  
the waitstaff is to wear.  
List of charges—All charges the client is expected to pay \(which must be  
included in the analysis you will make to determine the selection of a caterer  
and will factor into the event budget\) should be clearly itemized.  
Food and beverages— The itemized quantities, quality, and per-person or  
per-item prices.  
Taxes—Including local, state, federal, and/or luxury taxes on certain items.  
Gratuities/service charges— \[he obligatory charges for service personnel.  
Tipping—The optional amount paid to service personnel based on extra or  
exceptional service. Some caterers have a policy that tips are to be paid to  
the caterer, who will then distribute the amount evenly among the FOH  
and BOH staff.  
Equipment charges——An itemized list of equipment to be provided by the  
caterer \(e.g., tables, chairs, linens, etc.\) that is not included in the menu  
pricing, particularly for off-premise catered events. This list will also include  
the assignment of responsibility for lost or damaged equipment. 286 Food and Beverage Operations  
\* Setup charges—The fee for labor to set up the function room if not included  
in the menu pricing, often incurred for off-premise events or events requir-  
ing additional labor for a fast turnover of a room.  
\* Room rental rates—Many hotels charge room rental if the catered event is  
not linked with sleeping room nights, and some event facilities charge room  
rental as a separate line item from the in-house catering fees.  
\* Site commissions—Some venues charge a per-person commission on  
catering conducted at their facilities, which is usually reflected in the cater-  
er’s price quote as a differential rate “pending site selected” or as a separate  
line item.  
\* Overtime/other staff rates—The per-hour overtime charges for staff if the  
event extends beyond the times specified, and the per—staff person charges  
for additional or outsourced staffing such as action station chefs, bartenders,  
cashiers, security, and the like.  
\* Deposit policies and dates—The amounts and dates when deposits will be  
required. Most caterers require a deposit to book the date, often based on  
the length of time between booking and the actual function.  
¢ Refund and cancellation policies— \[hese policies stipulate the rates, dates,  
and conditions under which payments are to be made by the caterer  
\(refunds\) and the client \(cancellation\). These are usually based on the costs  
incurred and the ability to rebook the date.  
\* Alcohol service policy—This policy states the pertinent liquor laws and  
stipulates that they must be in full force during the catered event. If the  
caterer is not providing the alcoholic beverage service, the policy will verify  
the party that will be providing this service \(client or liquor caterer\).  
\* Leftover and brought-in food policies—Such policies specify what is to be  
done with leftover food \(e.g., donated to a shelter or food bank\). Because  
of product liability concerns, most caterers typically do not allow leftovers  
to be taken by the client. Outside food brought in by the client or guests,  
unless agreed to by the caterer because he or she does not provide a par-  
ticular item \(such as a wedding cake\), is typically not allowed, also because  
of product liability issues as well as prohibitions imposed by health  
permits and licenses.  
\* Indemnification, insurance, licenses, and permits— \[hese standard contract  
items cover liability issues and assign the appropriate responsibilities to the  
appropriate parties. \(See more on this in Chapter 12.\)  
Sanitation, Safety, and Legalities  
All food service and catering operations must comply meticulously with all health  
and food safety regulations, as well as the sanitation standards specific to the  
preparation and serving of food and beverages to the public \(see Figure 10.3\). As Menu Design

Food Service Safety  
Issues  
Debbie Thomas, CSEP, CDP, master hospitality trainer and catering consultant  
with the School for the Service Arts, Inc. reminds us regarding both waitstaff  
and catering in general, “If it’s not healthy, safe, or logical—don’t do it.” Many  
catering organizations also adopt the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points  
\(HACCP\) system of food safety management to identify, monitor, and control  
contamination risks and hazards associated with food-borne illness \(Loken 1995\).  
The hazards include the biological, chemical, and physical properties that may  
cause contamination, and the critical control points are those points, steps,  
or procedures during which a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or  
reduced.  
Always confirm that the catering operation complies with the legal regulations  
associated with food service operations and has the requisite health permits and  
appropriate business and occupational licenses. Of particular note, you should  
confirm that the caterer’s commissary has the proper zoning permit. Many zoning  
laws prohibit catering operations in residential neighborhoods, which would sub-  
sequently disqualify any caterer preparing foods in his or her home. Remember,  
anyone can have business cards printed. You must do the necessary due diligence  
to ensure that the caterer selected is qualified and authorized to prepare and serve  
food to the public.  
Menu Design  
Selecting the menus for the various food functions at an event will be coordi-  
nated between the client, the chef or catering executive, and the professional  
event coordinator. Menus must meet the nutritional needs of those consuming  
the food and beverages, as well as meet the goals, objectives, and purpose of the  
event. The menus selected will have both an emotional impact and a physical  
effect on the attendees. Certain foods can improve an attendee’s perception of the  
event \(and host\) and affect the attendee’s performance at the event \(see Figure 10.4\). 288

You Alert Help You Relax You Sluggish  
Identify Meal Functions  
The time, place, positioning, and purpose of a meal helps in determining what should be  
served at that meal \(see Figure 10.5\). For example, serving chicken dishes at both lunch  
and dinner will likely result in negative comments. You must have a complete overview  
of the food service, even if youre not responsible for more than one meal within that  
schedule, in order to serve a balanced menu of the right foods at the right times. The  
overall menu should have a pleasing balance of flavors, textures, and colors. Food is, after  
all, an art form to a talented chef and a form of nurturing to the hungry guest.  
Dietary Restrictions and Special Needs  
Dietary restrictions and special dietary needs—medical, religious, philosophical, polit-  
ical, or ethical—must also be considered. Physical or medical concerns can include  
food allergies, gluten or lactose intolerance, digestive problems, or low-sodium restric-  
tions, as well as access to water or a refrigerator for medicines. The American College  
of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology advises, “Eggs, cow’s milk, peanuts, soy, wheat,  
tree nuts, fish and shellfish are the most common foods causing allergic reactions,  
but almost any food has the potential to trigger an allergy. Foods most likely to cause  
anaphylaxis are peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish” \(allergy.mceg.edu/Advice/foods.html\).  
Jewish \(kosher\), Muslim \(halal\), caste-specific Hindu, and other religious  
dietary laws may require the exclusion of certain foods and restrict food prepara-  
tion methods \(you may wish to consult with a rabbi, imam, or other religious  
leader regarding such laws\). Those with philosophical dietary convictions include  
vegan vegetarians, lacto vegetarians, ovo-lacto vegetarians, and fruitarians. Those  
with political or ethical convictions include animal rights activists and environ-  
mentalists, prohibiting certain foods \(such as veal\) or requiring specific food items  
or ingredients \(such as dolphin-free tuna\). Corporate or association affiliations,  
such as a beef council or a beverage company, might require the inclusion of their  
products within the menu. Recovering alcoholics do not consume any alcohol,  
even that used in the cooking process, which may be a difficult dietary restriction  
to identify as those involved in recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous  
typically insist on anonymity \(some will simply say they are allergic\).  
It is the responsibility of the guest to let you know of any dietary needs or restric-  
tions, but it is your responsibility to provide the mechanism for letting you know.  
You might provide forms for special meal requests or ask for dietary needs when Menu Design 289

Marc Bruno, president of Philadelphia-based ARAMARK Sports, Entertainment and Conventions, is responsible for ARAMARK ’s operations at more than 170  
premier sports, entertainment, and convention centers across North America and the company’s Olympic catering projects. Bruno’s involvement with the  
Olympic Games spans more than 15 years, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,  
the 2000 Games in Sydney, the 2004 Olympics in Athens, the 2008 Beijing  
Olympics, and the 2010 Games in Vancouver.

Food and Beverage Operations  
Bruno's experiences planning menus for more than 3.5 million meals over  
a 60-day period for nearly 65,000 athletes, coaches, officials, and members of  
the media for the Beijing Olympics highlight some of the factors that go into  
designing dining and catering programs for mega events. “Olympic menus  
are the most diverse and extensive you'll ever see. Athletes from more than  
200 countries need menus that look very different than the ones for an aver-  
age spectator or member of the media. Athletes’ food is their fuel for perfor-  
mance, and it can make the difference between going home with a medal  
and going home empty handed. The variety and nutritional content must be  
extensively researched and prepared. Countless other factors go into devel-  
oping Olympic menus, including the availability of local and imported prod-  
uct, skill level of the culinary and service personnel, and kitchen equipment  
and facilities for production”  
Bruno noted that personnel and facilities were one of his biggest challenges.  
“Hiring and training 7,000 cooks, servers, and food service employees at the 2008  
Beijing Games was our biggest challenge. We were in a country whose workers  
were culturally very different from Westerners. The average employee was to  
work for only six weeks, had limited, if any, experience, and only spoke Mandarin  
we rrr eren Rt Sse Ler rrr \>TO EO PEANUTS Oil temreainehot4  
Chinese. As if the Olympic Games aren't challenging enough, you also have to  
remember that the kitchens and facilities are temporary. | was pleasantly sur-  
prised how wonderful the Chinese people and employees were. There was a  
great sense of pride and honor amongst them in being able to host and serve  
the athletes, coaches, officials, and media from around the world.”  
Other challenges included security measures, menu and service planning  
to accommodate special needs, and procurement. Bruno recalls the scariest  
moment in his career was when he was the manager on duty in the Olympic  
Village in Atlanta when a bomb went off in Olympic Park. “The security mea-  
sures have grown dramatically and become more stringent since my first  
Olympics in 1996. Today, all food product is monitored from the farm or pro-  
duction facility all the way to our kitchens to ensure safety and security. As an  
example, all product is X-rayed at the distribution center as it is loaded onto  
the trucks. Trucks are security sealed and tracked via GPS as they make deliv-  
eries, all the way into the Olympic venues.’  
Bruno notes that accommodating special needs becomes a very important  
factor when planning the menus and service around the Paralympics, which  
take place right after the Olympics. “These athletes have similar menu and  
nutritional needs, but the physical attributes of the service experience must  
be altered to accommodate wheelchairs, amputees, and vision impairments.  
continues  
remains essaeena PPA Menu Design 291  
4  
The layout of the seating, service counters, and flow of the dining rooms need |  
to be factored in when designing the facilities.” Procurement for the Olympics, |  
as with any program, “always focuses on quality, safety, and freshness,” says i  
Bruno. “Generally it will be the quantity of product that poses challenges. The  
intensity of the Games and sheer volume of food needed has the potential to i  
stress the supply chain at times.”  
When asked what factors he felt were critical for event organizers to con- |  
sider when planning food and beverages for their events, Bruno said the most  
significant one is the critical importance of planning. “When designing for any  
type of event, you should never, ever shortchange the planning phase. Most  
of the time, you only have one chance to get it right. Whether it’s dinner for  
10, 10,000, or 100,000, having a robust plan going into the event is key to flaw- /  
less execution.’ Beyond that, Bruno says there are “too many factors to name,  
but therein lies the challenge! You can't possibly consider everything that  
could take place or impact an event, with things like weather, travel, and  
politics outside of your control. That's why it’s so important to have the best  
and most experienced team around you, to keep your smile and sense of  
humor, be flexible, and learn something from every event to use at the next |  
one. With that, you’re bound to have a great event, no matter what the size!”  
| Finally, when asked what his proudest Olympics moment was, Bruno said,  
“At every Olympics, | have two very proud moments. First, when we serve our  
first meal. That is the result of several years and thousands of hours of plan- |  
ning, and it’s great to see when the plan becomes reality. The second moment  
is when we serve our last meal, as we close the books on a successful event,  
and our team gets a much-needed break!”  
Consider Cost and Quality  
The cost and market availability of the actual foodstuffs might drive your menu  
planning. Seasonal restrictions or shortages affect pricing as well as the freshness  
of ingredients. Instead of a large steak, you might consider the protein as an  
ingredient rather than the main item, perhaps serving a smaller portion of beef,  
but sliced and beautifully displayed. The caterer might be able to “dress up” a less  
expensive cut of meat with a special sauce or presentation.  
You must also confirm your food terminology, quality, and quantities. For  
example, to you a chicken salad might mean a bed of leafy greens with a grilled  
chicken breast sliced and splayed over the top, and to the caterer it might mean  
chopped chicken mixed with celery and mayonnaise next to a wedge of iceberg 292  
Food and Beverage Operations  
lettuce. And in the U.S. Southwest the actual ingredients in a bowl of chili varies  
from state to state \(and is the subject of many prickly disputes\). You must confirm  
portion sizes, ingredients, quality grades, brand names \(if applicable\), preparation  
methods, and presentation with your caterer so there will be no surprises when  
the guests sit down at the meal.  
Twenty-First-Century Food Trends  
The professional event coordinator should be familiar with current and emerging  
food trends in order to select the catering organizations that offer the food products  
expected by clients and guests \(see Figure 10.6\). New flavors and new foods come  
into fashion at different times and in different places. Food fashions may come and go,  
but healthy eating, high-quality ingredients, authenticity, freshness, variety, and fla-  
vor remain top on any list of food trends. To keep current on the very latest, many  
experts advise that the event coordinator scan the menus of five-star restaurants in his  
or her area \(or the area in which the event is to take place\) and review the culinary  
industry's periodicals for the most popular food items and developments.

Environmentally friendly food and beverage operations are becoming the norm  
\(see more in Chapter 15\). Best practices, according to the Convention Industry  
Council \(Green Meetings Task Force 2004, 8, 12\), include not only reduction of  
carbon emissions through locally grown and in-season menu choices. It advocates  
the following\:  
¢ Arrange to have leftover unserved food donated to a local food bank, home-  
less shelter, or soup kitchen, or separate it for pickup by a composting opera-  
tion or local farm.  
¢ Use environmentally friendly products such as recyclable plastics and reus-  
able cutlery, dishware, linens and decorations \(if disposables are unavoid-  
able, ensure the products can be composted and/or are biodegradable\).  
¢ Purchase and serve water, beverages, condiments, and other food items in  
bulk; any packaging should be recyclable and recycled.  
¢ Have attendees sign-up for meals on the registration form to indicate their  
intentions to attend specific meal functions throughout the event to reduce  
food waste and costs.  
Food Service Styles  
The style of service selected for a meal function at an event will affect the cost,  
timing, spatial requirements, and guests’ impressions. The selection of the appro-  
priate style of service will be based on the timing of and the time allotment for the  
meal function, the menu selected, the staffing capabilities, the budget, the venue, and  
safety and sanitation considerations. Certain styles require more serving staff, and oth-  
ers require more food per guest. Certain styles require highly trained waitstaff, and others  
require specialized equipment. Certain styles facilitate circulation, whereas  
others communicate formality and elegance. The professional event coordinator  
works with the caterer to determine the service style best suited to the purpose of  
the event, the budgetary requirements, the time restrictions of the food function,  
and the capabilities of the catering organization \(see Figure 10.7\).  
No service style is better than another—the appropriate style for a particular  
event depends on the purpose, goals, and objectives of the event and the needs of  
those being served. Service styles requiring more or highly trained staff might cost  
more than self-service styles because of labor costs. Self-service styles, however,  
typically require more food per person, because it is not known who will eat how  
much of which food items, and therefore may not offer much in the way of cost  
savings. Certain foods are not suitable for preset or plated buffet service because  
they will cool off, warm up, or melt while waiting for guests to enter the event or  
serve themselves. You must confirm the caterer’s capabilities, and caterers should  
agree to provide only those service styles with which they are experienced. 294 Food and Beverage Operations

Off-Premise Service Planning \(Continued\)  
The catering operation must plan its preparation setup for the type and scope  
of the food service it is to provide for your event, based on the menu, quantities,  
presentation, and location. It must schedule sufficient FOH and BOH person-  
nel, purchase and store the foodstuffs in a safe and timely manner, organize the  
prepreparations and cooking of foods, ensure sufficient tableware and serving  
equipment, choreograph the plating of perhaps hundreds or thousands of dishes,  
and design the path and traffic pattern from kitchen to guest or buffet so that the  
food is delivered efficiently and safely. The logistics of this precision operation are  
increased exponentially when the event is held at an off-premise location.  
Kitchen or preparation \(prep\) tents, even entire catering compounds, could  
be required to create and accommodate the catering operations at a temporary  
or underdeveloped site. The catering tents might need to be connected to the  
event space with covered walkways with nonslip flooring. The catering compound  
might have to be enclosed with screening or netting to ensure that it is free of  
insects. These temporary kitchens require sufficient power to operate equipment  
and provide work lighting, as well as fuels to operate cook stoves and/or grills,  
which must be in well-ventilated areas. There must be sufficient space for staff to  
conduct preparation, cooking, and plating operations, as well as take breaks. The  
kitchen or prep areas should not be visible to the guests and might be masked  
with pipe and draping or screens if it is necessary to have certain BOH areas  
within the function space. You might need to accommodate ovens, refrigerators,  
hot boxes, ice machines, outdoor barbecue grills, or a mobile kitchen truck the  
size of a mobile home. You must work closely with the catering organization to  
ensure that the site plan for an off-premise event meets its needs. 296 Food and Beverage Operations  
Additional Equipment Considerations  
All catering operations, both in-house and off-premise, supply the standard ser-  
vice ware, flatware, dishes, cups, glasses, tables, chairs, and plain linens needed for  
the catered event \(off-premise or independent catering organizations may itemize  
these separately in the quote\), but you must confirm this when contracting for  
any catering services. Depending on the type and style of the event, you may  
specify upgraded versions of these items, such as decorative china and other table-  
ware for a more formal event \(to be rented from a rental dealer\) or disposables for  
a more casual event, which may alter the price of the food service. Particularly  
for off-premise events, you must allot sufficient time and site access for the deliv-  
ery, setup, and removal of all food service equipment. If your event requires an  
entire temporary kitchen compound, it might require several days for setup and  
several more for tear-down and move-out, as well as special access roads for deliv-  
ery and mobile catering trucks.  
Alcohol Management  
Alcohol consumption is a part of a great many events, and although it may be  
accompanied by numerous risks that must be managed, it is an activity that  
the professional event coordinator must be prepared to coordinate and manage  
appropriately and effectively. Local and/or state statutes often regulate alcohol  
service and must be diligently adhered to. You must determine and comply with  
all legislation regarding the sales, service, and public health regulations pertain-  
ing to beverage service \(whether alcohol or nonalcoholic beverages\) and carefully  
consider the event’s context and crowd to control the inherent risks.  
Confirm the Purpose and Procedure  
In today’s world there are varied attitudes and opinions about alcohol consump-  
tion, ranging from total acceptance to total intolerance. You must not only con-  
firm the sponsoring host’s goals and objectives for serving alcohol, you must also  
confirm its appropriateness within the context of the event venue. For example, if  
the event is a corporate hospitality event held at a sports event, serving beer might  
be suitable at a public ballpark that sells beer to its regular patrons but not on the  
grounds of a stadium on public school property.  
You must also confirm whether beverages will be sold or complimentary, how  
they will be dispensed \(by ticket, cash bar, hosted bar, etc.\), and how they will be  
controlled \(by ticket, pricing, wristband credentials, etc.\). You must arrange for  
the appropriate staff and equipment to serve the beverages, as well as the appro-  
priate purveyors to provide the beverage products. Note that nonalcoholic bever-  
age options must always be available at any event serving alcohol. Alcohol Management  
297  
Alcohol Awareness and Service Training  
Most communities and governments, particularly in the United States, strictly  
regulate the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages through an Alcohol Beverage  
Commission \(ABC\) or agency responsible for administering the state’s liquor laws.  
Many have adopted a voluntary or government-mandated Responsible Beverage  
Service Program, designed to change the drinking context or environment by  
changing the behavior of those selling and serving alcohol. Such training pro-  
grams deal with identification, prevention, intervention, and the legal responsi-  
bilities associated with local liquor codes. They address the alcohol server’s legal  
and professional responsibility to control and limit the consumption of alcohol to  
prevent drinking to intoxication, to prevent the underage from drinking alcohol,  
and to prevent an intoxicated person from driving, as well as educate the server  
about the effects of alcohol on the body.  
Alcohol is a drug, and it is very important to understand how this drug works  
on and in the human body. Intoxication is measured by the blood alcohol con-  
centration \(BAC\), the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, which is affected by  
the size, weight, and gender of the consumer, as well as other factors. These factors  
include the type of alcohol \(distilled alcohol enters the bloodstream faster than  
beer and wine\), food consumption \(alcohol reaches the brain in a few minutes on  
an empty stomach and takes up to six hours on a full stomach\), style of beverage  
\(carbonation accelerates absorption, and warm beverages enter the bloodstream  
faster than cold ones\), and combination with other drugs \(prescription, over-the-  
counter, and illegal\). The brain responds to alcohol in stages corresponding to an  
increase in BAC \(see Figure 10.8\). Alcohol is removed from the bloodstream by  
the liver at a rate of approximately one drink per hour; otherwise it continues to  
build concentration in the bloodstream.  
Risk Management Strategies for Alcohol Service  
There are a number of strategies for reducing the risks associated with serving alcohol\:  
¢ Use only licensed liquor providers and trained bartenders.  
¢ Always provide food with alcohol service, avoiding salty snacks \(high-pro-  
tein, high-fat foods are best\).  
¢ Do not place bars near the door, but do place food stations near the door so  
that guests wiil begin eating before drinking.  
¢ Use a portion-control system \(jiggers or Posi-Pour dispensers\) rather than  
free pouring.  
¢ Limit portions to 1 ounce of distilled spirits per mixed drink, 5 ounces of  
wine, and 12 ounces of beer.  
¢ Do not allow doubles or shots.  
¢ Never allow self-service. 298

Close bars 30 minutes to one hour before the scheduled end of an event, offer-

Do not announce a “last call.”  
Feature attractive alcohol-free drinks.  
Implement a designated driver program \(perhaps offering free nonalcoholic  
beverages to drivers\).  
Arrange for a subsidized taxi or other transportation service to drive guests  
home.  
Purchase liquor liability insurance for the hosting organization.  
Monitor entrance to the event and issue credentials.  
Arrange for security personnel.  
Provide “family” or “dry” \(alcohol-free\) seating areas at sporting or festival venues.  
Managing Alcohol Costs  
When negotiating contracts with the venue or liquor provider for a beverage func-  
tion, you should specify how the pricing and consumption are to be calculated.  
For cash bar service \(the guest pays for individual drinks\), identify the prices  
to be charged for drinks and the fee for the bartender if a minimum of sales is  
not reached. For hosted bar service \(the host pays\), determine pricing based on Wrap Up  
299  
consumption \(per drink or per bottle\) and conduct a bar reading before and at the  
conclusion of the event \(counting the bottles opened and empties\), and for per-  
person/per-hour prices, specify how the number of guests will be determined. If  
providing your own alcohol \(either purchased or donated\), determine the corkage  
fees and drink setup charges for the venue to serve the beverages.  
Cost-saving measures include having servers pour wine rather than placing  
opened bottles on tables, providing drink tickets or coupons for two drinks only  
at hosted bars \(guests pay for additional drinks\), shortening the length of the  
beverage function, serving only beer and wine, serving frozen drinks \(because  
patrons are less able to determine the amount of alcohol in the drink, you can  
use less alcohol\), insisting on 1-ounce jiggers, and using smaller glasses for beer and  
wine to make smaller portions look larger. Also determine what is to be done with  
opened bottles of wine or liquor you will be charged for; for example, can they be  
sent to your hospitality suite?  
Public versus Private Events  
There are usually significant differences between public and private events as related  
to alcohol service. Public events are often subject to stricter standards of care regard-  
ing the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages than private social events. They also  
often attract a different type of attendee, which must be carefully considered in deter-  
mining whether to include alcohol in the event at all \(particularly at sports events  
attracting rowdy fans\). Additional attention must be paid to the use of licensed pur-  
veyors, attendance and credentialing control, and the segregation of serving areas, as  
well as securing the appropriate permissions from government agencies.  
Private events, however, are not exempt from your duty of care. With respect to  
third-party liability, social host laws in the United States specify that the host of a  
party or function that provides alcohol to its guests can be held responsible for the  
actions of the guests if alcohol has-been served improperly. Whenever possible, you  
are advised to always arrange for a licensed liquor caterer or purveyor to provide and  
serve alcoholic beverages at any function. You should also be wary of serving alcohol  
at any private functions where the attendees are participating in physical or sports  
activities, because people are more prone to accidents when they have been drinking.  
Food and beverages are a significant aspect of most events, and the right selec-  
tion of menu and service can enhance an event experience. The professional event  
coordinator must determine the functional needs of the food service to be pro-  
vided and the preferential needs and desires of the host and guest. To select the best  
catering operation to meet these needs, wants, and desires, the professional event 300 Food and Beverage Operations  
coordinator must be familiar with the types of food service operations available at or  
for the event location, type, size, scope, and purpose. The professional event coordi-  
nator must also understand how a catering organization conducts its operations in  
order to integrate those operations into the event site and other plans.  
The professional event coordinator must be cognizant of the nutritional, physi-  
cal, and emotional aspects of the foods we eat in order to select the menus that  
will fulfill the needs and desires of the attendees, participants, or staff to be fed, as  
well as the goals and objectives of the sponsoring host. Menu planning is based on  
the type of meal function, when the meal function is to take place, and the dietary  
preferences and restrictions of those being fed. The price of the food and beverage  
service selected will depend on the quantities and qualities of food required, the type  
of service requested, and the production costs involved. The menu planned must  
meet the hospitality objectives of the event as well as its budgetary restrictions. The  
menus selected should include foods and beverages that are healthy, fresh, full of fla-  
vor and variety, and suitable for the event agenda and the desired event experience.  
The professional event coordinator must ensure that the catering operations are  
in complete compliance with all health and safety regulations and that providers  
have the appropriate licenses and insurance coverage required. This is particularly  
important when including alcohol service in an event, because of the potential  
risks and health implications associated with alcohol consumption. The profes-  
sional event coordinator must be familiar with the effects of alcohol and the strate-  
gies to reduce and control risks, based on the context of an event and its crowd.  
REVIEW CHECKPOINTS  
1. How do the type, purpose, and location of an event affect the selection of the  
food service operations?  
2. What should be taken into consideration when developing a menu for a food  
function? Why?  
How does the style of food service affect the cost and timing of an event?  
4. How does one determine special dietary needs? Do personal preferences or  
diet crazes qualify?  
5. Why is alcohol management so important?  
EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Outline and describe the food and beverage services you would employ for the  
following events, including the menu\(s\) and the service style selected. Explain Wrap Up 301  
the logistical requirements associated with the food and beverage service and  
how these will be incorporated into your overall event plan.  
A. You have been contracted to coordinate the catering for an all-day golf out-  
ing for an incentive program, including an upscale luncheon inside a tent at  
the ninth hole. The 72 participants are the top salespeople for a pharmaceu-  
tical company known for its vitamin products, who expect to be wined and  
dined extravagantly.  
B. You are coordinating a four-day international conference for 500 health-care  
administrators to be held completely on-property at a remote seaside resort.  
You expect at least one-third of the attendees to have special dietary requests.  
Cc. Anew department store in a very upscale area of town has contracted you  
to coordinate a retail event with refreshments, to draw customers in to tour  
its various departments. The store’s biggest concerns, however, are keeping  
costs down and making sure the food and beverage service does not soil or  
cause damage to its merchandise.

CS 4GE& SDS Be . 2 a & Te SUH R \* Soe gos \*  
Making event memories relies on the ability to create a legacy by connecting  
personally with the people who have participated in the event experience. Human  
beings want and need attention and recognition. They need to be part of a group,  
excel in activities, learn new things \(about the world, themselves, and others\),  
share an experience, and treasure the moments in their lives. Many of these needs  
are met in the context of an event when people are gathered together to celebrate  
successes, express appreciation, share information, show off, confer, compete, and  
commemorate those special moments in their lives.  
The professional event coordinator has an opportunity to recognize and celebrate  
achievements, contributions, accomplishments, and attendance with tangible  
tokens—those items that make an event more meaningful and memorable, thus  
increasing the value of the event. Awards, prizes, gifts, souvenirs, and other amenities  
are used to increase awareness, encourage performance, reward actions, enhance  
objectives, sculpt behavior, express appreciation, and retain volunteers, employees,  
sponsors, and customers\:  
\* Awards—something earned prior to the event \(e.g., public service award,  
first place in an essay contest, etc.\)  
\* Prizes—something earned at the event \(e.g., luck of the draw, best cos-  
tume, etc.\)  
Gifts—something for someone who has not purchased it \(e.g., welcome  
basket, pillow gift, etc.\)  
Souvenir mementos—something every guest, or category of guest, is given  
at the event \(e.g., complimentary photo, engraved wine glass, etc.\)  
\* Souvenir merchandise—memorabilia for sale \(e.g., commemorative T-shirts,  
posters, etc.\) Creating a Legacy  
305  
These are keepsakes—items kept for the sake of remembering the event experi-  
ence. They can be incorporated into an event, based on the type and purpose of  
the event.  
Creating a Legacy  
Mementos are physical reminders of an event experience, creating a legacy for  
the event as these keepsakes are displayed, used, and shared with or shown to  
others after the event. Both souvenirs collected and gifts given at an event keep  
the memories of the event alive for an individual. Functional items recall the  
event experience each time they are used. Decorative items remind the viewer  
of the occasion. Some items become more valuable over time as collectables; oth-  
ers become more meaningful as the owner collects a progression of keepsakes at  
subsequent events. A well-chosen memento helps to make an event unforgettable.  
Supporting Objectives  
The professional event coordinator should consider promotional products and  
advertising specialties for each dimension or facet of the event experience, from  
the invitation to a departing gift, with the marketing objectives of the event in  
mind. Such items must be selected to reinforce the message and purpose of the  
event, as well as enhance its meaning to the recipient. These items should be cre-  
ated or selected based on the event's image or imprinted with the logo of the event  
to support branding objectives. They should also be considered part of the image-  
building process and integrated into the overall marketing plan.  
The Promotional Products Association International \(PPAI\) suggests that the  
promotional objectives these products help to achieve include building an image,  
commemorating or recognizing, developing trade show traffic, educating or moti-  
vating employees or customers, encouraging attendance/involvement, stimulating  
sales, introducing new products or services, and promoting safety or other pro-  
grams \(www.ppai.org\). Chapman \(1987, 161-162\) advises, “Premiums, incen-  
tives, advertising specialties, or giveaways are sometimes called ‘trash and trinkets’  
by exhibit managers. Clearly defined goals must be developed. If a memory is to  
be created, the item should reinforce your sales message.”  
There are opportunities for meeting an attendee’s needs with functional pro-  
motional items or mementos at any point when the attendee needs or wants to do  
something at an event. When such items are presented, whether they are mouse  
pads given out at a trade show or gift bags filled with indigenous edibles given  
to guests attending a destination wedding, an impression is made and a mes-  
sage is sent. Promotional messages or logos can be imprinted on hundreds of 306 Making Event Memories  
thousands of items, ranging from coffee mugs to chocolates, yarmulkes to yo-yos.  
You must consider the event location and theme, consumer trends and audience  
profile, quality and quantity required, budgetary constraints, and customization  
capabilities.

Joan Eisenstodt, meetings management consultant with Washington,  
DC-based Eisenstodt Associates, LLC, is a frequent industry speaker and  
trainer. She notes that “kinesthetic learners would prefer if everything were  
literally a hands-on experience. In many if not most cases, it is difficult or  
impossible to engage learners in the actual activity about which they are  
learning. Years ago, | heard it said that when one’s hands are engaged, one’s

How, then, do you hold a group’s interest? What can you do to ensure their

tice over many years of training is that toys and creative materials used by  
meeting participants change the look, feel, and perception of a meeting and  
that learners are more likely to be alert and involved throughout.” Over many  
years of trial and error, Eisenstodt's mainstay materials for engaging audi-

e Other—“Depending on the group, consider kazoos \(to help everyone  
march out of the room\), stress balls or other ‘squishy’ items in great  
colors \(to engage the eye and hand\), scented pencils \(I am partial to  
Smencils™\), small containers of bubbles \(with the advice not to blow  
bubbles into someone's face or beverage!\), and others that strike my  
fancy at the time.”  
Eisenstodt contends that the visual of walking into a room in which there  
are more than blank walls and plain tables enhances the perception and  
nee nm Omer  
energy of meeting-goers. “If the meeting is set in crescents or other table for-  
mations, place the items in the middle on each table. If the room is larger and/  
or there are no tables, have tables set up along the back or side walls onto  
which you can artfully arrange the creative materials for people to take as  
they enter or at any time in the session.’  
Engage the audience at the start of the program about why creativity and  
play are important. Help them understand that as children we often played  
with abandon and engaged our creative minds. Give permission for the audi-  
ence to play during the session and to get up from their seats to stretch and  
gather more of the items when needed. Tell them there will be no competi-  
tion to make something—that teams will not be formed to create a specific  
item. The idea is for relaxation and engagement, not added stress!  
“If you encounter resistance from individuals,’ says Eisenstodt, “suggest  
this\: that if you do not want to play, you are welcome to take the items home  
as the “wadja bring me’s”—that is, for co-workers or friends or family as a pres-  
ent! It takes away the pressure to perform during the session.’  
Putting Legs on the Event  
Physical reminders “put legs on an event,” meaning that they extend the length  
of time the message of the event is communicated. This suggests that the more  
functional or desirable the item, the longer the message will be communicated.  
A customized calendar almost guarantees 12 to 18 months of visibility. Logo  
watches or clocks can provide an hourly reminder. \(I still use a travel alarm clock  
I received as a speaker gift more than a decade ago.\) Clothing items with an event  
emblem may be worn during the event, then for months or years afterward. Logo-  
imprinted computer peripherals rest on desks, and customized trophies, certifi-  
cates, plaques, and framed photographs are proudly displayed on or in “memory” 308 Making Event Memories  
walls or cabinets in homes and offices. Always consider the marketing function  
the amenity is to fill as well as the functionality of the item after the event and its  
potential branding legacy.  
The legs or legacy of an event and its image will be particularly important to  
commercial sponsors of an event held in conjunction with their own branding  
objectives. Not only do these mementos provide the event organization with  
opportunities for recognizing sponsors, they are also prime packages for securing  
underwriting by sponsors. Hoyle \(2002, 46\) notes, “At your event itself, many  
opportunities exist for the marketing of the event and its sponsoring organization,  
creating not just a helpful item but also a memento of the event for the attendee to  
enjoy far beyond the final gavel . . . an effective cross-promotion, which is granted  
not just for an advertising fee but also to cover the cost of producing the \[item\].” The  
cobranding on such items benefits both event and commercial sponsor, but must  
be specifically agreed upon and contractually controlled.  
Memorabilia and commemorative items are not only mementos of a single  
event; they sometimes attain collectable status independent of the event and/or  
increase in value \(either monetary or emotional\) when obtained in succession.  
This is why such items must be branded and dated. Commemorative posters  
often appreciate in value when part of a series—something many annual festivals  
capitalize on for important revenue streams. Lapel pins signifying the number of  
years in service to a company or contributions made to an organization are often  
differentiated in design or material used, such as different gemstones for differ-  
ent levels of service or financial contribution. You might consider such items as a  
potential revenue stream for your event or as a way in which you can foster a sense  
of community and camaraderie within various stakeholder groups.  
Awards and Award Ceremonies  
Most people enjoy feeling like a winner—to be recognized and honored for their  
achievements, accomplishments, contributions, expertise, beauty, talent, or just  
plain tenacity. Events of all types include or are staged to provide tangible and  
ceremonial recognition for anything from a particular act to a lifetime of good  
works. The tangible expression is the actual award presented, and the ceremonial  
recognition is the way in which that award is presented, both of which must be  
selected and coordinated in a manner that has value to the recipient and meets the  
goals and objectives of the presenting organization.  
Determine Purpose and Scope  
The professional event coordinator must determine the purpose for conducting an  
awards program and the scope of that program in order to select the appropriate Awards and Award Ceremonies  
309  
awards and integrate the program into the overall event plan. The professional  
coordinator must identify the why, who, what, where, when, and how of the awards  
program. Every awards program has a purpose or motive for existing \(see Figure 11.1\)  
and should have specific and measurable objectives. The objectives may be based  
on sculpting desired behavior, motivating specific actions, increasing productivity,  
promoting certain agendas, attaching importance to accomplishments, and/or  
providing important revenues to the sponsoring organization.  
The award recipients might be selected via competition, level of contribu-  
tion, nomination, or consensus. They might be citizens, competitors, employees,  
entrants, members, officials, participants, patrons, supporters, or volunteers. Their  
motives for participating in an awards program could include recognition for per-  
sonal achievements and/or expertise, professional promotion, esteem, power, pres-  
tige, or enhancement of personal or corporate branding. The common theme,  
however, is recognition of the recipient, which must be factored into the event's  
overall marketing and promotional strategy. You might need to solicit entrants,  
recognize nominees, promote participation, coordinate media coverage, and/or  
create special events within an event to celebrate the recipients. Some award pro-  
grams put pictures and videos of the ceremony on their Web site, which might  
require advance notice in entry materials or collection of permissions at the event  
\(and you might need to control picture- or video-taking by friends and relatives  
during the ceremony\).

Making Event Memories  
Identify the Program Logistics  
Once the purpose of the awards program is clarified, the program logistics from  
selection to presentation must be identified and incorporated into the opera-  
tional plans of the event. You must determine the type, quality, and supplier  
of the awards to be presented, and the costs associated with their procurement  
and presentation must be factored into the budget. Where the presentation will  
take place, including staging and equipment, must be integrated into the site  
plan. The procurement of awards and the agenda for the presentation must be  
included in the timeline. Protocol requirements must be identified, procedures  
- must be established, propriety must be confirmed, and the presentation pro-  
duction must be determined. Many graduation ceremonies, for example, have  
specific protocols for who speaks when, how and in what order graduates will  
receive their certificates, how they will be arranged by seating, and how they  
will approach, ascend, and exit the podium.  
The awards ceremony might be part of an overall event program or the very  
purpose of the event. It might be a stand-alone ceremony, be incorporated into a  
meal function with different awards presented before or during different courses,  
precede or follow a meal function or other event component, be part of a meeting  
agenda, directly follow a competition, or be the focus of closing ceremonies.  
Devney \(1990, 82\) suggests that presentations must be scheduled when they are  
assured attendance, avoiding the very first and last activities of a day or agenda.  
Whenever the awards presentation and/or ceremony is to take place, it must be  
given the same attention as if it were an event unto itself.  
Steve Kemble of Steve Kemble Event Design in Dallas, Texas, advises that  
the type of ceremony depends on the personality of the group. He reports  
that his corporate groups prefer to have a separate awards ceremony \(about  
45 minutes long\) in a separate auditorium or ballroom that is exciting and  
stimulating for the audience, yet with a clean, straightforward presentation,  
and then to move on into the dinner and party in a different room. Kemble  
notes that awards programs are “very big deals” to companies and associa-  
tions and that his clients want “a serious and sophisticated ceremony that is  
well organized, tight in its presentation, that moves along at a great pace, and  
gives the opportunity for recipients to come up and say a few brief words,  
and BOOM, you're on to the next one” Awards and Award Ceremonies  
311  
The award recipient or recipients could be predetermined prior to the cer-  
\_emony or selected on-site at the event. If recipients are to be predetermined via  
judging, but the announcement of the winner is an on-site surprise, you dont  
want to ruin the moment by calling to confirm attendance. You do, however,  
want to ensure that the winners are present whenever possible. Steve Kemble sug-  
gests, “People want to see the winners. It is incumbent on the planner to do some  
due diligence and make sure they are there, perhaps calling an assistant, friend, or  
relative.” It might also be appropriate to contact a family member or friend of an  
individual who is to be honored with a special award, but does not know about it  
beforehand, to ensure that those close to the recipient are present to share in the  
celebration while maintaining the secrecy and surprise. If the winners or recipi-  
ents are to remain secret, you must ensure the security of that secret information  
within your operational practices and with the involved stakeholders.  
Selection Criteria and Judging  
As a professional event coordinator, you may or may not be involved in the selec-  
tion of recipients, but you must know how recipients are selected in order to  
integrate the program into the event timeline and agenda. The crucial part of any  
awards program is the establishment of equitable selection criteria and judging  
procedures. Entry procedures must be clear and concise, and the judging process  
must be impeccably fair. It is advisable to have the rules reviewed by a committee  
and the entry guidelines reviewed by a broad spectrum of potential entrants to  
ensure that they are understandable and reasonable.  
The selection criteria should be identified for all award categories, specifying the  
levels of performance required to qualify or the measurements the judges will be  
instructed to employ when reviewing entries or participants. The entry forms or guide-  
lines should answer the question, “How do I do this so I can win?” You must specify  
what materials in what format are to be included in an entry, what documentation will  
be required to qualify, where the submission should be sent or delivered, the deadlines  
for submission or qualification, and the date and manner in which nominees, winners,  
or qualifiers \(and those not nominated, winning, or qualifying\) will be notified.  
If the awards program is a competition, the jury or judging committee should  
be selected carefully to ensure that they are qualified to evaluate the submissions  
entered, preferably a panel of industry or professional peers, and that they are rec-  
ognized as reputable and ethical individuals. Korza and Magie \(1989, 35-36\)  
suggest that jurors should be chosen to create a balanced panel representing exper-  
tise, involvement \(practitioners, educators, etc.\), male and female, ethnic diver-  
sity, and geographic equitability. Judges should be provided with a copy of the  
entry instructions as well as the evaluation criteria they are to use when reviewing  
submissions. Judges may be asked to interview entrants, view examples of the  
entrants’ work, or evaluate the entry documentation. 312 Making Event Memories  
The winner or qualifier might be selected based on a voting system \(by simply  
counting the number of nominations or votes\) or on the basis of a score received,  
or might be selected after a consensus has been reached among the judges or  
members of a selection committee. Many people believe that a “blind” or anony-  
mous judging process is the most equitable, wherein each entry is identified by  
an entry number rather than the entrant's name \(and the name is not visible  
anywhere within the entry\) and the judging is based on a private scoring mecha-  
nism rather than consensus \(preventing one strong personality from influencing  
or dominating the outcome\).  
Selecting and Customizing the Award  
Awards could take the form of trophies or cups, framed certificates, plaques, statu-  
ettes, bowls, sculptures, medals, ribbons, paperweights, clocks, or artworks. They  
might be small, medium-sized, or tall, multitiered trophies as large as the recipi-  
ent \(often popular for sports events and children’s beauty pageants—with the  
trophy towering above the toddler winning it\). They might be made of plain or  
precious metal, crystal, glass, Plexiglas, ceramics, wood, or other materials. They  
might be purchased from a supplier of recognition merchandise or commissioned  
from an artist or craftsperson and can be relatively inexpensive or extremely costly.  
You might need to have security to protect such articles against theft \(and for  
secrecy of the winner's identity\) before and at the event.  
Awards should be inscribed with the logo of the event or organization \(brand-  
ing\), the name of the award and/or category, the recipient’s name, and the date of  
the presentation. Engraving or customizing takes time and should be done prior  
to the ceremony if the recipient is known beforehand, or the name can be added  
after the event if the winner is not determined until the ceremony takes place.  
You must make absolutely certain that all names and titles are spelled correctly.  
It is possible to have a mock award available for presentation and photographs  
at the event and then have the actual award engraved and sent to the recipient  
later. It might also be a good idea to arrange for a shipping service to ship awards  
home for recipients when the ceremony takes place in a city or country different  
from the recipient’s place of residence. \(I once came home from an international  
conference with four awards that added 20 pounds to my already overstuffed and  
overweight luggage.\)  
Presenting Awards  
The logistical dynamics of an award presentation must be integrated into the  
production design and schedule, and you must have a script. How will the awards  
be displayed, if at all, prior to the presentation? Who will present the award itself?  
How will you get the award from the display area to the presenter? Will you have  
“trophy guys or gals” to run on and off the stage to hand over statuettes? Will the Prizes and Gifts  
313  
presenter need to have an introduction prepared? Will you need to have a descrip-  
tion of the nominee’s entry read and/or visuals projected prior to announcing the  
winner? How will you secure those visuals? Do you need to videotape interviews  
prior to the event, to be played at the event, or will you allow recipients to express  
their feelings live? Will the recipients come out of the audience to accept the  
award, or will they make an entrance from backstage? Will you have a follow spot  
to shine on a recipient as he or she goes from the audience to the stage? The entire  
procedure must be envisioned, and every detail must be prepared.  
It is important to remember that this is, after all, a ceremony, and the appro-  
priate pomp and circumstance must be incorporated into the program. You must  
choreograph all entrances and exits for presenters, recipients, assistants, and the  
emcee. You might wish to include a parade of all the nominees at the begin-  
ning of the ceremony to communicate the high honor of their being nominated.  
To ensure that the ceremony moves at the appropriate pace, you might wish to  
include walk-up and fanfare music, and you might need to advise all recipients or  
nominees of a time limit for acceptance speeches. Presenters should be rehearsed  
and should be prepared and instructed on how to “accept this award on behalf  
of” should the winner not be present. These winning moments should always be  
captured on film, but not necessarily onstage. Most award ceremonies now set  
up a photo area offstage where the official documentation \(and souvenir\) photo-  
graphs are taken.  
Prizes and Gifts  
Many types of events incorporate prizes, gifts, and other amenities to increase  
excitement and create memorable moments within the event. These items  
enhance the celebratory aspects of an event and provide take-away value for the  
participants. The professional event coordinator must determine how and when  
these items will be incorporated into the event and how they will be presented  
\(individually or collectively, privately or publicly\). The costs of purchasing them  
must be factored into the budget, and the logistics of their presentation must be  
incorporated into the event’s operational plans.  
Understand the Motives  
You must understand the motives of the sponsor or host, as well as those of the  
winner or recipient. Contests are often conducted to increase participation and  
promotional coverage, and they are entered in order to acquire something impor-  
tant to the winner. Raffles are often held to raise important funds for the orga-  
nization, and participants wish to support the cause while also having a chance  
to win a valuable prize for a small investment. Door prize drawings are often 314  
Making Event Memories  
conducted to generate qualified mailing lists for an organization and give regis-  
trants an opportunity to walk away with valuable gifts. Gifts and commemorative  
items are given to recognize status or express appreciation. Incentives are given  
and incentive programs are conducted to reinforce and reward desired behavior  
or performance. Mementos are presented to create added value and enhance the  
experience. There is always a reason for investing in these items, both for the giver  
and the receiver, which will help determine what should be given and when. The  
more valuable the object or recognition is to the recipient, the more likely he or  
she will participate and the more likely the host's objectives will be met.

Dana Zita, CSEP of aNd Logistix, Inc., in Toronto, Canada, an event manage-  
ment company specializing in corporate incentive trips and conferences,  
says she is always making time to listen to suppliers and sourcing new  
items and ideas for promotional products for her clients. She and her staff  
brainstorm tag lines and store gimmicky items for later use, often sending  
out examples with her company logo on them to communicate the mes-  
sage, “We can do this for your event.” Zita also notes that the type and qual-  
ity of the item must match the level of the event. “For incentive programs,  
the invitation has to be as nice as the items they will get while on the trip—  
even the ticket wallets and agendas must be special.” And if the budget has  
been cut, Zita reports that the attendees will notice and comment on the  
difference. “What happened to the room gift?”

Confirm Propriety and Suitability  
Although most people love getting any type of prize or gift at any time, always  
investigate the propriety of giving prizes or gifts and the suitability of the prizes or  
gifts to be given. Some attendees are contractually prohibited from accepting gifts  
of a certain type or value, and others are ethically prohibited from accepting any  
gifts at all because a gift might be perceived as an unfair inducement or bribe. The  
giving of gifts might be inadvisable for political or public relations reasons \(e..,  
corporations under scrutiny for “lavish” spending\). Some dignitaries should not  
be given gifts of a certain type or value for cultural, political, or protocol reasons,  
and some government officials \(or employees\) are prohibited from accepting gifts  
of any value whatsoever. Some people have religious, cultural, or physical restric-  
tions that prohibit accepting \(or using\) certain types of gifts, such as wine or other  
alcohol. Examine the protocols and determine the restrictions on gift giving in  
order to select appropriate gifts that will achieve the objectives for giving and will Prizes and Gifts  
315  
not offend the receiver or be left behind in the hotel room for the housekeeping  
staff to clear away. When budgeting for amenities, it is important not to waste  
money on inappropriate gifts.  
Amenities Add Meaning—at a Price  
Gifts and amenities are gestures of appreciation that show how much the event host  
or sponsor cares about the attendee or guest. Every aspect of such a gift, from selec-  
tion to presentation, will have costs attached that must be incorporated into the event  
budget, particularly if those costs are to be packaged into the price of the sponsorship  
of an item. This includes not only the gift or amenity itself; it also includes the pro-  
curement, Customization \(printing or imprinting\), the packaging, and the delivery.  
There might be shipping costs, personnel costs to prepare or parcel out the items,  
the cost of the boxes or bags to package the gift, and hotel charges for the room drop  
\(hotel staff delivering items to individual guest rooms\) or to store and deliver items  
to the event office. Preparing gift bags or registration kits for 2,000 attendees takes  
a small army of personnel and could incur rental charges for the room in which it  
takes place. Asking the caterer to place table gifts while laying the dinner tables might  
incur additional labor fees. There might be a charge for the housekeeping staff to add  
special soaps or other products to toilet facilities or reception areas.  
Welcome, Speaker, and Pillow Gifts  
Welcome gifts are often placed in guests’ rooms prior to arrival or given upon  
arrival. Speakers and dignitaries are often presented with commemorative items at  
the close of their appearance as a gesture of appreciation by the hosting organiza-  
tion. Incentive groups often receive gifts each night of their trip, placed in their  
rooms on their pillows \(hence the term pillow gifs\), which are designed to remind  
them of the day they just experienced or to promote the next day's activities.  
These gifts should always be considered from the recipients’ point of view. Where  
are the recipients coming from? How long will they be at the event? What will  
they be doing while at the event? When and where are they going after the event?  
How are they getting there?  
These gifts should be functional as well as gestural. A welcome basket should  
consist of items capable of being consumed during the person's stay or something  
that will facilitate participation in the event to come. Thank-you or speaker gifts  
should be selected with regard to their physical size and weight \(must the item  
be packed for the flight home?\) as well as their suitability for the event’s objec-  
tives and the recipient’s preferences. Although a person might not refuse the gift,  
it might be left behind unused or passed along to someone else, which is not the  
intent in budgeting for these gifts. Note that in regard to giving alcohol as gifts, a  
fine wine may seem to be both consumable and an elegant gesture; however, you  
must carefully consider its appropriateness. Giving alcoholic beverages as gifts  
might carry the same liabilities as serving alcohol, and alcohol is not a suitable 316 Making Event Memories  
gift for an individual who does not imbibe. \(You could also have an inebriated or  
hungover speaker standing at the lectern the next day.\)  
Pillow gifts offer the professional event coordinator an opportunity to facilitate  
a progressive experience. Customized apparel can provide the personal costuming  
or sportswear needed for the next day’s special events, such as a tournament, team  
activity, or theme party. Indigenous arts and crafts can provide a unique memento  
of a destination to be visited. Novels by local authors can provide a literary insight  
into sights seen, and picture books or photographs can commemorate places vis-  
ited. When selecting gifts for a progressive presentation, you should allocate the  
budget for gifts so that the final gift is the most impressive and memorable.  
Fun and Fair Contests  
Contests are often incorporated into an event's promotional strategy to increase  
awareness and/or revenues and are included in the event's activities to encourage  
participation. Prizes are given to recognize a particular talent or proficiency, spe-  
cific characteristics or effort, or by the luck of the draw, and the prizes awarded can  
include anything from a door prize to a grand prize to a booby prize. You might  
be conducting a drawing, raffle, beauty or talent contest \(for people, pets, or photos\),  
endurance or proficiency contests, games of skill, games of chance, or sport com-  
petitions. You might be awarding certificates, coupons, crowns, food, medals,  
merchandise, money, ribbons, scholarships, services, travel, trinkets, or trophies.  
Door prize drawings are very popular for increasing trathe and building databases.  
Raffles are very popular as fundraising mechanisms. For boosting income at fund-  
raising events, Freedman and Feldman \(1998, 27—28\) suggest selling chances for  
prizes by selling numbered rubber ducks in a duck pond, keys to a treasure chest,  
grab bags, and selling guesses \(e.g., the number of jelly beans in a jar\).  
Contests and games are fun, but they must be carefully planned to ensure that  
they are impeccably fair, particularly as the prizes increase in value \(see Figure 11.2\).  
All aspects of a contest, from the methods for entry to the prizes to be awarded, must  
be meticulously planned before the contest is to commence. A time frame must be  
established specifying when the contest will begin and end, when entry forms will  
be available, the entry deadlines, and when winners will be selected and notified.  
A budget must be established to cover all the administration, marketing, equipment,  
prizes, and other costs associated with the contest. Then all the components of the  
contest must be integrated into the overall event plan and timeline.  
Legal and Ethical Considerations  
When conducting a contest, first and foremost you must confirm the propriety  
and legality of the contest, including any licenses, waivers, limitations, or specific  
wording of the rules required by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the contest  
is to be held \(include statements such as “Void Where Prohibited by Law,” or  
“All Decisions Are Final”\). Some types of contests, particularly games of chance Prizes and Gifts 317  
Entry Rules Entry Procedures Entry Form Prize System Selection Procedures Prize Presentation Publicity Plan Security Plan Specify who is eligible to enter; the fees for entering; what qualifications must be met  
and/or what materials must be submitted \(e.g., puzzle solution, proof of purchase, etc.\);  
how many times an individual may enter; how the winners will be selected \(method and  
criteria\); and whether an individual must be present to win.  
Determine the distribution and collection system for entry forms \(or raffle tickets/keys\);  
specify where, when, and how to enter; specify ownership of the entry materials.  
Collect the required information \(name, address, telephone number, etc.\); clearly  
specify contents or limits of prize\(s\); include rules and regulations \(the entry form can  
be considered a contract\).  
Determine the hierarchy of graduated value, size, names, color, etc.; purchase or solicit  
prizes from sponsors and donors; display prizes.  
Specify criteria to be used to evaluate contestants and select judges; specify the method  
for drawing a winner \(e.g., first come first draw, or one working key to a prize or prize  
container\) and the entry form container; and specify how ties will be broken.  
Determine the date and time and method for announcing winner\(s\); engage celebrities  
or dignitaries to present prizes; determine how a prize will be delivered if not on-site or if  
the winner is not present \(shipped or picked up\); determine how unclaimed prizes will be  
handled.  
Publish and publicize contest rules and regulations, promote the contest, and publicize the  
results.  
Determine the security system required for distribution, collection, and protection of entry  
forms; protection of prizes; and protection of entry fees.  
Figure 11.2  
or raffles, are strictly regulated by ordinances governing gaming or gambling, Contest Coordination  
which could affect something as simple as a door prize drawing or coupon-entry rate  
contest. Fundraising activities are often rigorously regulated and require securing  
special permits, filing various tax forms, and preparing specific documentation.  
The more valuable the prize, the more stringent the rules must be and the more  
the rules must be meticulously upheld. According to Ron Kaatz \(1989, 113\),  
“Whether you are conducting a large national sweepstakes or a small local contest,  
its success \(and often the reputation and financial well-being of your company\)  
can depend upon how clearly the rules are spelled out.” Try to anticipate any way  
in which someone could abuse the entry procedure; then develop clear, fair, and  
unambiguous rules and regulations to prevent such loopholes. You must ensure  
that all contests are nondiscriminatory in terms of entry qualifications and access.  
You must also make certain that there is no actual or perceived conflict of interest  
with any of the event organizers or stakeholders. There must be no question as to  
the veracity of the outcome and how it was reached.  
Auctions  
Auctions are a popular fundraiser and can include live auctions, silent auctions, or  
chance auctions. The prizes are typically donated and can include products, ser-  
vices, or “encounters” such as a dinner date with a celebrity bachelor or luminary, 318 Making Event Memories  
or a dinner prepared in one’s home by a celebrity chef. The “retail” value of the auc-  
tion items are often disclosed, sometimes with minimum opening bids required.  
Live auctions require an auctioneer who announces the current highest bids  
and who the winning bidder is, and is often supported by assistants circulating  
through the audience to identify and encourage bidders. Silent auctions have the  
prizes, often a package of related products and/or services, displayed on tables  
with bidding sheets in front of each on which bidders may check the status of  
their bid throughout the duration of the event.  
Chance auctions \(sometimes referred to as “Chinese auctions’\) are a combina-  
tion of a silent auction and a raffle. The prizes are displayed like a silent auction  
but with a box in front. Bidders purchase tickets \(or “earn” them, such as through  
casino activity winnings\) and put as many tickets as they want in the boxes of  
the prizes they wish to win, and the winner is selected by drawing the winning  
ticket from the box. Another iteration of the chance auction is the blind auction  
or “mystery box” wherein the prize is covered and bidders do not know what or  
how valuable the prize is.  
Auctions require a variety of personnel including those who solicit, collect, and  
record donated items; those who package items \(e.g., gift baskets, bags, displays,  
etc.\) and arrange them attractively; registrars who collect names and payment  
information from bidders and issue them bidding paddles or cards for live or  
silent auctions, or sell tickets for chance auctions; handlers to move items on and  
off stage during live auctions; monitors to ensure the security of displayed items  
and answer bidders’ questions during silent or chance auctions; and personnel to  
process payments and arrange delivery as needed.  
As with contests, organizers must make certain auction activities are in compli-  
ance with all regulatory requirements. Precautions must be taken when a prize  
includes alcohol to make certain bidding is restricted to only persons of legal  
age. Prizes that have certain restrictions such as certain dates or age limits for a  
travel package or resort stay must be clearly identified, and rules might need to be  
established regarding “flipping” of such prizes—the reselling on eBay, Craigslist,  
etc.—to ensure compliance with fundraising laws and donor restrictions. All  
“encounter” prizes should be carefully vetted to ensure the safety of both the  
“prize” personality and the bidder.  
Souvenir Mementos  
and Merchandise  
Many events, particularly those open to the public, incorporate the direct sale  
of merchandise into their marketing plan to provide souvenir mementos for the  
attendees and important revenues to the event organization. Whether planning to Souvenir Mementos and Merchandise  
319  
sell or give away such tokens of the event experience, make certain that these sou-  
venirs represent the event and the event organization appropriately and will have  
value for the buyer or recipient. You might be selling commemorative collectibles,  
distributing souvenir programs, choosing concessionaires, licensing manufacturers,  
or creating the event’s own logo merchandise. Providing a variety of souvenirs and  
for-sale merchandise allows the event attendee to select his or her own mementos,  
based on specific needs, desires, and the event experience he or she had, as well as  
the mementos to be shared with others who receive them as gifts after the event.  
Develop the Retail Merchandising Plan  
With respect to souvenir merchandise that will be sold to the event attendees,  
you must understand that these are products. These take-home mementos must  
be selected, manufactured, promoted, and merchandised as any other product in  
the marketplace is, relying on sound marketing principles to shape the merchan-  
dising plan. However, as with any plan, you must determine the purpose of the  
merchandising plan and its position within the overall marketing plan. Are you  
selling souvenirs to increase revenues? To increase event visibility? To increase the  
legacy of the event? To meet customer demand? To enhance the event experience?  
To provide cross-promotional opportunities to sponsors? All of the above?  
Merchandising should not be undertaken without a clear understanding of  
why and how it is important to the event and event organization’s goals and  
objectives, as well as the impact it will have on the event and the safeguards  
required to implement a retail merchandising plan. Getz \(1997, 208\) suggests  
these goals of a merchandising strategy\:  
\[Sell merchandise that benefits the event in terms of revenue, positive image, and  
long-term growth; partner with appropriate wholesalers and retailers in ways that  
maximize benefits to the event; license goods where the arrangement extends the reach  
of the event and secures revenue that could not otherwise be obtained; and regulate  
all merchandising on and off the site to assure quality and proper image protection.  
If you do decide to invest in a merchandising program, you must approach  
it as any other retailer would. The four Ps of an event merchandise marketing  
mix—product, price, place, and promotion—should be examined carefully in terms  
of how they will be integrated into the retail merchandising plan as well as the  
overall event operations plan. Hoyle \(2002\) identifies a fifth “P”—positioning—for  
target market segmentation, which is not addressed in this discussion because it  
will be inherent in the target audience identified for the event.  
Product  
You must determine whether there is a demand for souvenir merchandise and which  
products will meet the needs and desires of the event’s buying public. The products 320 Making Event Memories  
you select will be determined based on the event type, date, location, and theme, as  
well as the target market represented by and representative of the audience, consumer  
trends, the quantity required, the quality and availability of items, the cost of produc-  
tion, and the lead time for ordering and reordering. You might be selling apparel,  
jewelry, pins and buttons, commemorative items, indigenous or event-themed crafts,  
functional items, decorative items, toys, posters and other printed items, and/or  
imprinted promotional products. Experts advise that you conduct market research  
in order to identify the items, and the features of those items, that will appeal to your  
audience. You must analyze the audience demographics and psychographics, review  
the history of souvenir sales at your event and at comparable events, and test market the  
items under consideration before investing in the merchandise.  
Price  
When determining which products you will offer, the retail price must match  
the perceived value of the item to the buyer. Some inexpensive products can be  
priced to include a significant profit margin because they are in great demand,  
whereas other products might command prices that include only a narrow profit  
margin. The prices that your audience will pay depend on the desirability of the  
particular item, the disposable income of the purchaser, and the competition for  
that purchase revenue. Many event organizers advise that you select a variety of  
products at low, medium, and higher price points in order to serve the variety of  
consumer budgets at your event. However, if you have an exclusive event with  
attendees just itching to spend serious amounts of money, by all means select  
high-end products with high-end prices.  
Place  
Place refers to distribution methods and where the products will be sold—how,  
when, and where the customer can make a purchase. The objective should be to  
make it convenient for the buyer to purchase your product at the time and place  
the buyer wishes to buy. You might have on-site sales kiosks, booths or stands,  
or walk-around vendors. You might also offer your merchandise via mail order  
through catalogs or an event Web site, through off-site retail outlets, on consign-  
ment or commission through community or affinity groups, and/or wholesaled  
through distributors. Products may be sold before, during, and after the event  
itself, Each type of distribution/sales method will require inventory management  
systems \(ordering, maintaining, and controlling inventory\), financial manage-  
ment systems \(payment schedules to manufacturer and collecting and disbursing  
revenues or royalties\), and distribution systems \(shipping, retrieving unsold mer-  
chandise, and contingency plans for late arrival of merchandise\).  
On-site retail outlets should be positioned in high-traffic areas, including  
entrances and pathways to popular event features, as well as on the pathways to Souvenir Mementos and Merchandise  
321  
more functional features such as food service areas and toilet facilities. Analyze  
the trafhe flow through the event site, and position permanent and temporary  
outlets based on the density of traffic as well as the type of traffic \(you might  
have souvenirs targeted at different demographic groups that travel through the  
event site in different patterns\). Also analyze the timing of the traffic flow so that  
you can ensure sufficient sales personnel and inventory for the peak sales times,  
often concentrated at the beginning or ending of the event or at specific attrac-  
tions within the event. These on-site outlets must also be positioned where they  
are easily accessible for purposes of restocking inventory \(yet do not compromise  
safety movements\).  
Many events extend the marketability of their souvenir merchandise through  
e-commerce by offering it for sale on their Web sites, using a shopping cart system  
that generates an online catalog and allows customers to order and pay for prod-  
ucts over the Internet. These systems allow you to create an online catalog with a  
searchable index by category and/or keyword that features photos \(or thumbnail  
images the shopper clicks on to see a full-size picture of an item\), product descrip-  
tions and prices, and color and/or size options. Online customers simply point  
and click their way through the catalog, adding their purchases to a shopping  
cart that maintains a running total on a scrolling receipt in a side frame, visible  
at all times, until the customer checks out and pays with a credit card via a secure  
server to your merchant account with a credit card processing gateway. \(Use the  
key words “shopping cart system” on any search engine for more information and  
resources.\)  
Promotion  
If you are selling products, you must promote those products. Your merchandis-  
ing strategy should include plans for advertising, promotions, cross-promotions,  
publicity, and the design of the retail outlet\(s\). You might use advertisements in  
your event program, signage throughout the event site, announcements over the  
public address system, and attractive and eye-catching displays at the points of  
sale. You should also identify potential promotional partners that can increase  
your coverage through cooperative advertising, including the distributors, manu-  
facturers, media, sponsors, suppliers, and other stakeholder groups. Your mer-  
chandising promotion campaign must be integrated into your overall marketing  
plan and timed to coincide with your distribution and inventory management  
systems.  
Logo Merchandise  
Many public and repeat events, as well as event organizations and associations  
holding annual events, have recognizable logos or images that are emblazoned  
on a broad variety of merchandise items that are sold during an event and often 322 Making Event Memories  
year-round. This merchandise allows the purchaser to proclaim an afhliation with  
the event or organization as well as collect mementos of a specific event. From  
apparel items to zippered bags, logo merchandise can add significant revenues  
to an event's coffers, particularly if the items are of high quality and functional.  
Membership organizations should select items that are pertinent to the lifestyles  
and vocational activities of their members, promoting these goods not only as  
items members should collect but also as gifts for colleagues. Consecutive or  
annual events should consider the sequential collectability of progressive images  
and specific dates merged with the traditional branding or organizational logos.  
Protect Your Image  
Whether you are creating your own logo merchandise, granting a license to allow  
a manufacturer to put your logo on its products, or allowing vendors or conces-  
sionaires to sell products at your event, you are selling space, selling rights, and  
selling your image. You must always protect the image of the event and the event  
organization by carefully considering the partnerships you are entering into. Such  
protection can entail anything from establishing exclusive territories to product  
liability insurance or protection from counterfeit merchandise.  
Merchandising or licensing rights are often included in sponsorship agreements  
in order to control brand integrity and the range of allowable event merchandise a  
sponsor can sell \(Skinner and Rukavina 2003\). Getz \(1997, 207\) states\:  
Licensing is the legal tool used to obtain royalties, and protect the event’ rights,  
when distributors and retailers are granted permission to sell event-related goods.  
In order to license products the event must have protection for its name, logo, or  
designs in the form of copyrights, trademarks, or other legal devices.  
This is a complex legal arrangement that must be handled by competent legal  
counsel to ensure that the licensing contracts protect and benefit the event orga-  
nization as well as the licensee. Pick your partners carefully, and control the rela-  
tionship with clear, comprehensive, and written agreements that specify all the  
operational details and image-protection conditions. Many event organizations  
contract out the entire merchandising operation to professional retailers who have  
the experience and expertise to provide a profitable experience for both parties.  
# Merchandising  
The term merchandising also refers to how merchandise is displayed for sale. When  
setting up on-site sales outlets for event products, the professional event coordi-  
nator should adopt and adapt standard retailing methods to meet the needs and  
constraints of the event site and budget. You might be selling your merchandise  
from carts, kiosks, booths, stands, or tents. You might have an on-site bookstore Wrap Up  
323  
or book-signing event at a conference selling speakers’ books, or allowing speakers  
to conduct back-of-the-room sales after their presentation. You could allow post-  
performance sales of videos and CDs of the entertainment attractions at a festival.  
As with any sales activity, the proper permissions must be acquired by the sellers.  
The sales area must be laid out to facilitate profitable traffic flow, including  
sufficient access to displays and products and sufficient aisle space; Underhill  
\(2000\) refers to this as the butt-brush factor—if aisles are so tight that shoppers are  
touched from behind, they become irritated and move on. The sales area should  
be brightly decorated so it is visible and recognizable as your souvenir outlet from  
a distance, and the interior should be designed to highlight your products and  
motivate shoppers to buy.  
Completing the purchase should be efficient and easy. Checkout counter\(s\) must  
have the appropriate equipment \(cash registers, credit card terminals, etc.\) and sup-  
plies \(wrapping, bags, etc.\) to complete the necessary transactions, and they must  
be staffed with efficient, friendly sales personnel. The sales force must be properly  
trained to ensure that they are knowledgeable about the products, the inventory is  
maintained appropriately, and cash-handling procedures are followed correctly.  
The sale of merchandise at an event can be a profitable addition to your rev-  
enues, but it must be carefully planned and implemented to achieve the results  
you are seeking. If it is an afterthought, it will likely fall short of your revenue  
goals and objectives. The entire operation, from the accounting system to security  
at the retail outlet, must be integrated into your event site, budget, timeline, mar-  
keting, operations, and personnel plans to achieve success.  
Wrap Up  
Tangible items help to create memories and achieve the marketing goals of  
an event and an event organization. The professional event coordinator must  
select the amenities, awards, gifts, prizes, and souvenirs to be presented by and  
available at the event so that they meet the objectives and expectations of the  
presenter and the recipient. Mementos, as reminders of the event experience,  
must support the marketing objectives of the event and must project the desired  
message and image, as well as extend the legacy of the event to provide a return  
on the investment made in them. These items may be functional or decorative  
and should be customized, branded, and dated to ensure they commemorate  
the event experience. Many of these keepsakes offer opportunities for sponsor  
recognition and sponsorship revenues.  
Awards programs must be designed to provide the appropriate tangible and  
ceremonial recognition for the recipients, as well as encourage participation to  
achieve the underlying objectives for the program. The logistics of an awards  
program must be meticulously planned from selection to presentation, and all 324 Making Event Memories  
competitions and contests must be impeccably fair. All award, prize, and gift pro-  
grams must conform to all legal restrictions and protocol requirements, and the  
professional event coordinator must confirm that the items presented are appro-  
priate for the event context and culture.  
The sale of souvenir mementos and merchandise provides important revenues  
for many events. When employing a retail merchandising plan, the professional  
event coordinator must apply sound marketing principles to the design, selection,  
promotion, and display of the products to be sold. By carefully considering the  
marketing mix of product, price, place, and promotion, the professional event  
coordinator will be able to secure and implement the direct sales of souvenir items  
that project and protect the image of the event and have value to the consumer.  
The giving and selling of tangible event keepsakes must be budgeted appropriately  
and integrated into the event’s overall administrative, operational, and marketing  
plans to ensure a meaningful and profitable outcome.

# ADMINISTRATION  
Out of intense complexities intense  
simplicities emerge.  
= Winston Churchill, British politician \(1874-1965\)  
After a friend of mine kept saying she wanted to do what I did, I invited her to  
join my team for an upcoming event so that she could really see what went into  
the job. She came to me a couple of weeks into the planning process to say she  
wouldn't be coming back. “I’m sorry, but it looked so easy.” I told her that it was  
easy, once you know how.  
An event is all about people—people coming together to create, operate, and  
participate in an experience. As with any other endeavor, this involves a large  
amount of administrative work to ensure all those people can do what they need  
to do in a safe and effective manner. It is this seemingly uninteresting work that  
makes it possible to create \(and recreate\) successful events without reinventing  
the proverbial wheel, and to manage the multifaceted responsibilities associated  
with bringing all these people together.  
The following four chapters focus on the administrative responsibilities and  
tactics that make certain your event is safe, well-staffed, and reliable; that your  
tangible, intellectual, and human resources are reputable and renewable; and that  
you are able to make it all look easy.

Safe Operations  
If you mess up, fess up!  
—-Peoine Erhevarria. American motivational speabes  
CQLHE LCNECVATTIA, LINCTICAR MMOUVaALLONAL Speake\}  
in this chapter you will learn how to\:  
e Identify, analyze, and prepare response plans for risks associated with  
the event project.  
e Establish and implement the appropriate internal and external  
on-site communications systems and organizational procedures,  
including procurement of the proper equipment.  
e Ensure that event operations provide a safe and healthy environment  
for all those in attendance and involved.  
e Determine, procure, and deploy the appropriate security personnel and  
equipment to protect the people, property, and assets of and at the event.  
e Coordinate medical and emergency services and procedures,  
including liaison with the proper authorities and provision of the  
appropriate level of on-site medical care and emergency response.  
329 he event coordinator called together all the staff, volunteer department heads,  
and suppliers for a meeting the day beforé the start of a three-day summer  
concert series. Although they had come together many times before to discuss opera-  
tions and risk management issues, the event coordinator wanted one more meeting  
to review all the plans and procedures for managing and controlling the risks they had  
identified. The whole team reviewed, point by point, the entire event plan and went  
over the protocols for each contingency and possible emergency. With the full commit-  
ment of the entire team toa zero-tolerance goal for all safety and security hazards, the  
event coordinator closed the meeting in the style of the police squad shift briefings  
from the television show Hill Street Blues, “Let's be careful out there... and let's save the  
surprises for the audience!”  
e  
Being careful and being prepared are not only sensible as event coordination  
guidelines, they are ever more important \(and increasingly regulated into legisla-  
tion and policy\) for all events and event professionals. Safety issues must be con-  
sidered throughout the event coordination process and for all the facets, features,  
and elements of the event plan because there is potential risk associated with  
every aspect of an event. The professional event coordinator incorporates risk  
management procedures throughout the planning and production of an event, as  
well as communicating to and securing from everyone involved a commitment  
to the highest standards of safety throughout the operations. This might be the  
responsibility of the professional event coordinator alone, or might rest with a  
safety committee, safety officer, risk manager, or head of security, yet it is the duty  
of the professional event coordinator to make certain this commitment is infused  
throughout the organizational structure of the event team. Safety is everyone's  
job, and everyone must accept it as such.  
As a professional, you have a legal, ethical, and financial responsibility to make  
certain that the event and its operations maintain the highest standards of safety  
possible; otherwise, you or the event organization might be held negligently liable  
for any harm that occurs. Negligence is the failure to use, either by act or omis-  
sion, the degree of care that an ordinary person of reasonable prudence would use  
under the given circumstances. Yet because you are a professional—the person  
taking on this leadership role—you might be held to a higher standard of care Managing Risk  
331  
than an ordinary person. You must not neglect these safeguards, because such  
neglect can indicate indifference to the probable consequences that should have  
been recognized by a professional.  
Managing Risk  
There are never unlimited resources. There are no guarantees in life. The only constant  
is change. Stuff happens! Given all of these caveats, it is clear that there will always be a  
certain amount of risk associated with any event project. The professional event coor-  
dinator must carefully identify, analyze, plan for, and manage these risks by examining  
problem areas and available options to develop suitable action plans for identified risks.  
Risk is “an uncertain condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect  
on a project objective. A risk has a cause, and if it occurs, a consequence” \(Project  
Management Institute 2000, 127\). Note that risk is not exclusively negative. There  
might be a risk that your Concert in the Park fundraiser is more popular than your  
wildest dreams and you are selling tickets at an unprecedented rate. At a certain  
point, you would implement your contingency plan to secure more portable toilet  
facilities or bring in several more food stalls. This risk can be a good thing.  
However, most risk management efforts are directed at the potential hazards  
associated with an event. As of this writing there are no international minimum  
risk management standards for events, but there are numerous factors that have  
been identified as specific to special events, as outlined in Figure 12.1, that increase  
the degree of risk but do not necessarily mean the event will be “risky.”  
The greatest threats to running a safe operation are habit, inertia, and ignorance.  
These are also the hardest practices to overcome, particularly within an established  
or long-standing organization. Unfortunately, until something bad happens, many  
people do not make a conscious or dedicated commitment to the safety and welfare  
of those involved in or attending an event. When something bad does happen,  
fingers are pointed, lawsuits are filed, reputations are ruined, and the emotional and  
financial consequences are devastating. Finally, planning policies and procedures  
are put in place-—policies and procedures that should have been in place all along\:

Whether we are considering threats posed by people’s behavior or threats ema-

address the consequences. Some of these occurrences can be prevented, but many  
can only be anticipated so that the appropriate procedures and services are in  
place to handle such situations should they arise. The standard risk management 332

procedure, as shown in Figure 12.2, should be followed. It is important to under-  
stand that risk management is an ongoing, integrated, and iterative process.  
Resources must be allocated, plans must be devised, and a commitment must  
be made to manage the uncertainties and vulnerabilities surrounding your event.  
You must examine the worst-case scenarios and the best-case scenarios in order to be  
prepared with the appropriate plans.  
One of your standard operating procedures should be to a conduct a risk  
assessment—what could go wrong, how it would affect your event, and what you  
can do about it—for each and every event project. Identify the potential threats to  
the safety and welfare of those who will be in attendance, including staff, volunteers,  
and participants. For each threat or risk identified\:  
© Describe the nature and cause\(s\) of the threat or risk.

\* Determine what could be done to reduce the likelihood or the impact of it  
happening.  
¢ Decide what protective measures and response options you are able to and  
will provide.  
¢ Specify how and who will be responsible for monitoring risks and the  
performance of response plans.  
The scope of your prevention, contingency, and emergency action plans will depend  
on the intent, extent, and content of the event being produced. As you examine the  
event elements and components, you must evaluate the potential health and safety  
hazards of each \(see Figure 12.3\). You must uncover and understand the vulnerabili-  
ties and implement the appropriate precautionary safeguards. Absolutely everything  
in the event plan and at the event site must be evaluated from a safety perspective. As  
with all other aspects of professional event coordination, there should be no surprises.  
Risk that is managed properly ensures that the safety and welfare of those in atten-  
dance \(as event-goers and event workers\) has been suitably considered and provided  
for. It also makes it possible to avoid costly mistakes and reduce liability. Lack of, or  
poor risk management increases the likelihood of accidents, dangerous conditions,  
costly mistakes, cost overruns, and potential legal consequences \(even incarceration\).  
Risk Identification  
Risks are identified by reviewing historical information and industry standards; inter-  
viewing subject matter experts; conducting brainstorming sessions with the event  
team, vendors, and key stakeholders; and sometimes through simulation and scenario Managing Risk  
335  
forecasting. You should continuously develop checklists to serve as the starting point  
for the risk identification sessions. As you go through the event element list item by  
item, question all assumptions and consider options as they relate to the cost, sched-  
ule, scope, and quality of the activities, products, and services included in the event  
plan. The causal influences associated with each risk identified should also be consid-  
ered to determine whether there will be several risks driven by a common cause.  
Although an event-specific assessment should be done for every event project,  
your risk management plan should be continuously improving. It will be added  
to, adjusted, and customized rather than reinvented. The scope, content, and  
context will be different for every project, even for those events that are recurring;  
therefore, every time you identify risks or threats you are adding to the menu of  
potential threats, vulnerabilities, hazards, and other emergencies and the possible  
response strategies, many of which might be applicable to your current event\:  
\* Create a standardized format for your action plans \(so that you can “cut and  
paste” as needed\).  
\* Conducta post-mortem analysis after every event to capture the lessons learned.  
\* Compile and maintain a checklist of threats or incidents that have occurred  
and the response strategies you have employed.  
e Add the experiences of others to this inventory through continuing education,  
networking, and reading news stories, articles in industry publications, and  
books on risk and emergency management.  
Brad A. Goldberg, CMP, owner and CEO of Tampa, Florida—based TriGold Con-  
sulting, LLC, often provides risk management site inspection services to the  
meetings industry. He recalls one particular group that is very much at the fore-  
front of asking for the moon and wanting to pay for just a slice, In this particu-  
lar instance, the group had known about their meeting in Orlando, Florida, for  
over two years. The venue contract had been signed 18 months prior and the  
group had done a site visit just to make sure the space met its needs.  
Two weeks before the event, an e-mail pops up on his screen. Would it be  
possible for him to take a quick drive over to Orlando and look at the prop-  
erty from a risk management point of view? Goldberg agreed to do so since  
he was going to be in Orlando near the property anyway, but informed them  
that he could provide only a cursory look. “! was all set to depart a few days  
continues  
# ON-SITE  
INSIGHT 336 Safe Operations  
later when an e-mail comes from the meeting planner with an attachment\: a  
checklist that encompassed over 200 items for me to look at, including items  
ranging from the location of the nearest AED \(automated external defibril-  
lator\) to the type of floors that would be used during the reception \(tile or  
parquet, etc.\). Having set aside a brief amount of time to look over the already  
contracted facility, | immediately responded that the requirements they  
provided would take all day and would significantly drive up the fee. After  
a short delay, | was told thanks but no thanks and they would take care of it.”  
Goldberg decided to follow up after their meeting to determine how suc-  
cessful they had been. It turned out they never did the “risk management site  
visit” and they ended up taking not one but several attendees to a walk-in  
clinic due to small injuries. “When asked what caused the injuries, they were  
reluctant to tell me, but | finally discovered that the dance floor had been  
parquet and there were a few twisted ankles, among other things. Luckily  
they did not need the AED \(I found out later that the majority of the attendees  
were between 50 and 70 years old\).’In the end, a one-day site visit might have  
prevented some of these accidents. Although no site inspection will ever be  
perfect when it comes to preventing disasters, it is the professional event  
organizer \(“with the emphasis on professional”\) that will ensure a site visit  
includes a look at the risk management side of the house.  
Risk Analysis  
Once the potential risks are identified, you must assess the likelihood and impact of  
each. Tarlow \(2002, 42\) notes, “All event risk analyses should be based on the prin-  
ciple that there is no object, person, or reputation that cannot be stolen, damaged, or  
destroyed.” You must also prioritize risk based on its potential impact on the event.  
Determine which risks can and/or must be avoided and which could be mitigated  
with additional event elements such as back-up equipment or other contingency  
planning, based on your event organization's threshold of tolerance. As you are con-  
sidering each identified risk, identify and evaluate the available options and their  
impact on the event's quality and resources. There will likely be a cost—in money,  
time, personnel, or quality—for any response option selected, and there will often be  
more than one alternative to any response plan option. Each alternative will have its  
own set of implications, including costs, rewards, and potential residual risks.  
For example, if you are having a big-name rock-and-roll band playing at a  
fundraiser concert, you might need to construct a barrier between the stage and Managing Risk  
337  
the audience. This barrier could be made of fencing \(wire, mesh, or wood\), or you  
could use security personnel lined up along the edge \(uniformed guards, off-duty  
law enforcement officers, or volunteers in event T-shirts\). The fencing option will  
have costs associated with fabrication and/or installation. It will have an impact  
on the look of the stage. It might have an impact on the event grounds, depending  
on the type of fencing and the installation procedures. The security guard option  
will have costs associated with it as well, either for hiring or subcontracting  
personnel or for T-shirts for the volunteers. Uniformed security or off-duty law  
enforcement personnel sometimes create an offensive or militaristic feel to the  
event, yet untrained volunteers might not be sufficient if the audience is likely to  
be aggressive about approaching the stage. Clearly, each option and its alternatives  
must be considered from a variety of perspectives.  
Response Plans  
There are four ways to handle risk\: avoidance, transference, mitigation \(reduction\), and  
acceptance \(retention\). Avoidance means you do not take the risk at all. Transference  
means you transfer the risk through insurance, performance bonds, warranties,  
guarantees, or contractual liability. Mitigation includes incorporating safeguards into  
your plan and targeting the linkages or causes that control and prevent the potential  
severity of the impact. Acceptance includes your contingency plans.  
With your options identified, communication will be the foundation of the  
success of your response plans. You must specify your reporting format, including  
how and when decisions will be made to implement any portion of your plans  
and how this will be communicated to the event team. The triggers, actions, and  
individuals involved must be determined. Your list of potential responses must be  
linked with the threshold of tolerance that will trigger the response and specify  
what action steps will be taken. You must also specify those individuals empowered  
to make the decision to implement a response. To eliminate any false alarms, only  
one person should be authorized to change, move, or cancel an event element, or  
the event itself. These roles and responsibilities should be documented and com-  
municated to the entire event team.  
You must verify and validate your action plans with the host organization or  
your client so that the resources required to implement a risk response or contin-  
gency plan are fully funded and supported. The host or client must be informed  
of the triggers, actions, and individuals involved and must be included in the  
communications surrounding response implementation.  
# Monitoring  
The action plans \(prevention, contingency, and emergency\) must be integrated  
into your timeline so that you will be able to monitor situations and/or conditions 338 Safe Operations  
and act as required and appropriate. This includes periodic risk reviews, performance  
reviews, taking corrective action when necessary, implementing change controls,  
and continuously updating your plan. What happened, why it happened, and when  
it happened must be included in your documentation procedures.  
Be proactive rather than reactive. Decisions made in a panic are rarely cost-effective  
or efficient and often lead to more risk and unpleasant consequences. If at all possible,  
incorporate a generous response time into your schedule so that your action plans  
can be integrated into the event plans and implemented smoothly if required.  
It is better to have the wedding reception weather tent installed and beautifully  
decorated, but not required, than to have the bride’s lasting memory be a muddy and  
miserable wedding day.  
A risk management walk-through should be conducted prior to the opening  
of an event, periodically during the event, and after the event has ended. This is a  
walking tour and survey of an event site to observe and correct any safety hazards.  
It should include the professional event coordinator, venue management, key  
suppliers, and safety officials such as the fire marshal, health officer, or police  
authority. At this point, you are looking at the event site as it will be used by the  
audience or attendees, searching for anything that needs attention prior to opening  
the event. If anything is found, it must be corrected, repaired, or removed before the  
event opens. The same holds true for the walk-through during and after the event.  
Neatness does count. Fastidious attention to keeping goods and materials neatly  
stored, rubbish and debris cleared, and equipment maintained properly will help  
to reduce the possibility of accident or injury. The site must be clean, safe, and  
secure throughout the duration of the event operations. Safety concerns do not stop  
when the party starts, and what was safe yesterday might not be safe today.  
Insurance  
As noted, there are four ways to handle risk, one of which is to transfer risk  
by purchasing insurance coverage. Of course, insurance will not prevent some-  
thing from happening; it will only lessen the financial impact should it hap-  
pen. An insurance policy is a legal agreement for transferring risk that defines  
what will be paid for, in the event of a defined loss, in exchange for a defined  
amount of money \(the premium\). Work with an insurance broker to identify  
and purchase the appropriate insurance coverage for the type and size of event  
that is being produced.  
Most purpose-built and commercial venues will require specific levels of insur-  
ance coverage, primarily commercial general liability \(CGL\), also known in some  
countries as public liability insurance, which usually protects your organization if  
a volunteer, employee, or other individual, supervised, directed, or whose duties  
are controlled by the organization, makes a mistake and a patron is injured or has Managing Risk  
339  
his or her property damaged. This coverage is not universal, however, and you  
must always check the exclusions in your policy because not all persons injured  
and all property damaged may be covered. You should always secure certificates  
of insurance \(proof of coverage\) from your vendors, particularly those providing  
their goods and services on-site at the event.  
Onetime \(often called “one-off”\) and annual events often require event liability  
insurance, sometimes called spectator insurance, which will be priced according to  
the type of event and the capacity of the audience, and perhaps the event elements  
to be included. James N. Decoulos, a Massachusetts lawyer and insurance broker  
specializing in legal and insurance services for special events, explains that an event  
liability policy is really a CGL policy issued on an industry standard form, but rather  
than for the usual one-year term, it is issued for the duration of the event. Decoulos  
advises that there are basically four kinds of losses that should be addressed with the  
procurement of insurance coverage, as illustrated in Figure 12.4.  
Risk of Loss Insurance Product  
Property Loss to tangible property \(e.g., Homeowners  
equipment\), intangible property \(e.g., Renters

# Communications  
Although there is a constant flow of information throughout the event coordina-  
tion process, on-site communications are a separate challenge during the often-  
frenzied activity just prior to, during, and just after the event. The professional  
event coordinator must plan for this frenzy with the proper systems, hierarchy,  
equipment, and predetermined protocols to ensure that the necessary information  
is communicated in a timely manner to the appropriate internal and external  
constituencies \(see Figure 12.5\).  
On-site communications will encompass the normal information exchange  
required during the run of the event, but must also be set up for a quick response  
to an emergency, should it occur. Particularly in an emergency, communication  
channels with the media must be anticipated and implemented in such a way as to  
control the damage that could occur as a result of speculation or misinformation.

This is why it is so important to designate \(and train\) a spokesperson to respond  
to the media in times of crisis, and you might consider specific access controls to  
prevent damaging or distressful footage from being broadcast.  
Structure the Communication Channels  
The channels of communication at an event will probably be similar to the chain  
of command established within the organizational chart for the event team. This  
organizational chart is segmented into various components or departments \(see  
Figure 12.6\), which are often used to provide the hierarchy of communications  
on-site at the event. When this chart is combined with the site or floor plan and the  
event running order or production schedule \(all three should be posted on-site\),  
the channels should be apparent and reinforced with a contact list, including the  
telephone numbers and frequencies of radios or other equipment assigned to each  
contact person. The organizational chart is used for assigning manageable pack-  
ages of responsibility, the site plan is used for assigning manageable zones of  
responsibility, and the production schedule is used for assigning responsibility for  
manageable segments of activity.  
The entire event team should be thoroughly briefed on this hierarchy of com-  
munications, and each person should be provided with a copy of the contact list.  
This includes the event staff, all suppliers and vendors on-site, as well as all the  
emergency personnel and authorities that will have jurisdiction over the event  
and be on-site at the event, either during or if responding to an emergency. It  
must be made absolutely clear to everyone who is authorized to implement con-  
tingency and emergency action plans and who will respond to authorities or the  
media should an incident occur. The organizational chart might also be impor-  
tant in a legal dispute \(i.e., illustrating assignment of liability, responsibility, and/  
or authority\).  
By making the communication channels obvious and accessible, and making  
it clear that safety is the top priority, everyone can “speak up” and speak to the  
right person when vulnerabilities, hazards, and emergencies-waiting-to-happen  
are uncovered or recognized. However, it is up to you to give this permission and  
mandate to speak up, as well as providing the appropriate channels to eliminate  
potential conflicts or hard feelings between competitive rivals working together as  
subcontractors at the same event.  
Briefing and Debriefing Meetings  
A primary component of the communication process, in the planning phase as  
well as during on-site implementation, is the face-to-face meeting. The on-site  
meetings include the precon \(the preevent briefing\), the postcon \(the postevent  
debriefing\), daily briefings, and the all-important safety meeting. The precon 342

Technical producer Robert Estrin of California-based Creative Event Tech-  
nology asserts that all the providers at an event should take responsibil-  
ity for ensuring that the event is a safe environment. He recounts that he  
was involved in an 18-month-long lawsuit over injuries caused by another  
vendor's negligence, but, as is the standard practice in filing a lawsuit, the  
plaintiff's lawyer named anyone and everyone connected with the event,  
including all the subcontractors. After those 18 months of depositions and  
court appearances, of course his company was acquitted of any liability,  
but that did not prevent his being required to deal with the accusation. He  
notes that every vendor should be aware of every other vendor and speak to  
the event coordinator or planner if he or she sees something that is unsafe  
or likely to cause a safety hazard. “If ice is spilled on the dance floor, whoever  
sees it should speak up. Don't just leave it to the banquet captain because it’s  
his job. It’s everyone's job!”  
Estrin also contends,  
What many don't recognize is that security does not equal safety at events.  
Making sure that an event is secure does not automatically make it safe.  
While a security plan needs to be shared only with those directly involved  
with it, a safety plan needs to be shared with everyone working at the  
event. In addition, it needs to start when the first person arrives at the venue  
to start setup and continues until the last employee leaves after the event.  
Safety will always remain an issue for every event, regardless of size.

includes all the primary stakeholders, including subcontractors, and is a review  
of all the event components, the production schedule, roles and responsibilities,  
and updates on all expectations and conditions—what is supposed to happen.  
The postcon is a review of what actually took place to resolve any complaints and  
document suggestions for future events. The daily briefings are for the purpose of  
monitoring and updating plans for all the functional aspects and emerging issues  
of the event.  
The safety meeting, however, is for those involved in the actual setup to review  
the actions to take place and confirm the safety imperatives established for the event  
operations. Although the risk assessment and other meetings often involve the  
department heads or management personnel of the subcontracted suppliers,  
the safety meeting on-site should involve all their staff—the workers \(and volunteers\) 344 Safe Operations  
who will be installing and operating the equipment for and during the event.  
These people are often excluded from the, chain of communications; conse-  
quently, they do not get the important safety messages. You should always have  
a sign-in sheet for safety and risk management meetings so that you are able to  
monitor attendance and participation.  
Establish a Command Center  
The professional event coordinator should create a functional network of all  
assistance methods and personnel so that potential or emerging problems can  
be responded to before they become hazards or emergencies. Many risk manage-  
ment professionals \(see, for example, Berlonghi 1990; Emergency Management  
Australia 1999; and Silvers 2008\) specify that this is best achieved by centralizing  
your oversight personnel in a command center. For large events, this will probably  
be an office or a trailer strategically placed within the event grounds, and many  
purpose-built facilities have a room designated and equipped for just this function.  
For smaller events, such as a banquet or reception, the command center might  
simply be a table in or near the tech booth or at the back of the function room.  
Keeping Connected through High and Low Technology  
Use a variety of communication methods and modalities to keep connected with  
the people and the pulse of the event operation \(see Figure 12.7\). This connection  
must be maintained not only within the confines of the event site; there must be  
a connection with external constituencies and conditions during the event pro-  
duction. You need to know what is going on outside the event that could affect  
what is going on inside the event, and vice versa. The means of maintaining this  
connection and communication can include high-tech and sophisticated systems,  
such as computer networks and closed-circuit television surveillance, and/or low-  
tech methods, such as designated personnel roving through the event observing  
the audience and activities or the professional event coordinator stationed at the  
back of the function room. The level of connection will depend on the scope and  
needs of each particular event.  
The most common event-related types of communication equipment include a  
public address \(PA\) system for communication to an audience and two-way radios  
\(walkie-talkies\) for communication between event personnel. All systems for oral  
communication between event staff and security personnel should have two-way  
functionality, should be multimodal, and should have their own backup power sup-  
plies. Two-way radios are battery-operated and will become useless unless charged  
properly and regularly; you might need to have extra radios so that you can always  
keep one set in its battery charger. When the event has loud activities or noisy areas,  
security, medical, and operations personnel should use headsets and/or earpieces. Communications

Communication  
Modes and Types

Communicating with the Crowd  
The PA system is a vital link between the event and its audience. For many large  
events such as festivals, fairs, sports events, and expositions, such systems are used  
to deliver information about activities and promotional messages throughout the  
events in addition to important safety and/or emergency announcements. This  
constant “voice-over” connection with the crowd is an audible layer of the event  
experience, but you must make certain that there is a distinct difference between  
these announcements and announcements related to the safety and welfare of  
those in attendance. Note\: Fire officials advise that at any event with an attendance  
of 300 or more, even meetings of short duration, an announcement should be made  
indicating where the exits are.  
Welfare announcements \(e.g., lost child, lost and found, instructing people to  
meet their family at a certain location, etc.\) and safety or emergency announcements  
\(e.g., cancellations or closures, evacuation, egress routes, location of safe or secure  
zones, etc.\) must be carefully planned and scripted to ensure that people listen to  
them and do not panic. The style and languages in which these announcements  
will be broadcast must be determined. They must be delivered in a professional  
and calm tone of voice, at the correct volume, and must be worded so they are  
perceived as authentic and responded to appropriately. Berlonghi \(1996\) advises  
that a sequence of scripts should be developed to announce the purpose, severity,  
and immediacy of the situation, as well as specific instructions on what actions the  
public should take. These announcements should be repeated numerous times  
and delivered in an even yet authoritative tone. Ensure the wording and tenor of  
emergency announcements is proper so as to avoid panic caused by unprofessional  
announcements. 346 Safe Operations  
If you are planning to use the onstage sound system provided by an entertainment  
or audiovisual \(AV\) program to deliver safety announcements, you must confirm  
this with the entertainers and/or AV technicians. If using a house PA system instead  
of an onstage sound system, make certain you have a way to mute the onstage system  
in the event that an emergency announcement must be broadcast. If using the PA  
system as a primary communications method, code potentially alarming messages  
to alert specific personnel instead of the entire audience\:  
¢ “Dr. Able, please meet your party at the beer garden” —to signify to the first  
aid team that there is a medical emergency at the beer garden  
e “Will Mr. Baker please report to the information booth”—to signify to  
security personnel that a bomb threat has been received and they should  
report to the command center  
Make certain that PA broadcasts reach all the required areas of the event site.  
Such areas can include inside and outside a building or buildings, within dressing  
rooms or meeting rooms, parking areas, and the corridors and stairwells leading  
into and out of the event venue. Other audible communications might include  
sirens and alarm bells to signify an emergency or evacuation, but these must be  
supplemented with calming and credible announcements.  
# Safety  
The professional event coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the site and  
all elements of the event provide a safe and healthy environment for those who  
have been invited, either personally or promotionally, to the event experience.  
These elements include the venue and site design, fire safety, incident planning,  
communication, crowd management, transportation management, structures,  
barriers, electrical installations, lighting, food, drink, water, sanitation facilities,  
waste management, noise and sound vibration, special effects, and everything  
else pertaining to the event. Of paramount concern must be any life safety issues  
such as fire, electrocution, drowning, structural collapses, and anything that could  
cause a person's death.  
Determine the Hazards  
The hazards or dangers associated with an event can range from someone slip-  
ping on a wet floor to being assaulted in the parking lot, or tripping over a power  
cord to being crushed to death in the collapse of a stage or grandstand. The event  
site or venue must be scrutinized both before and after the event has been set up.  
When conducting the site inspection, you should consider every potential struc-  
tural and topographical hazard. This is especially important for outdoor venues. Safety  
347  
You should be looking at the use of the site or venue in the context in which it  
will be used for your event—from the moment the first staff member or worker  
arrives, to the time when the attendees or guests arrive, and until they have all  
safely departed.  
What could they trip over? ¢ What could they slip on? ¢ What could they fall from? ¢ What could fall on them? ¢ What could they fall into? What could they run into?  
¢ What could run into them?  
¢ What could they get sick from?  
e What could stick or cut them?  
¢ What could bite or sting them?  
Consider what you are bringing into or onto the event site and the layout of  
the event site. The equipment and décor must be in good structural condition,  
not just cosmetically appealing. Tents and marquees must be made with suitable  
\(fireproof/retardant\) materials and installed properly. Any temporary structures,  
such as those listed in Figure 12.8, must be properly installed and suitable for the  
expected use and loads, and the bases must be protected from vehicular damage.  
Staging sections and platform risers will have to be braced and/or clamped securely  
together and must have appropriate safety railings and steps. All décor items must  
be anchored properly to prevent their collapse or falling over. Anything suspended  
overhead must be securely rigged.  
Check the ambient or house lighting to make sure it will be sufficient to illu-  
minate the entire event space. The lack of lighting can make hazards invisible  
and antisocial activity anonymous. Consider also the decorative lighting and its  
installation and/or rigging \(as well as sound system equipment\). Lighting instru-  
ments and the battens on which they are hung can be very heavy—and deadly  
if they come crashing down. In addition, lighting and sound systems require  
electricity to operate, which involves cords and cables that must be secured and  
ramped \(covered\).  
Consider the movement to and through the event space, including the distances,  
the terrain, the pedestrian surfaces, corridors, aisles, stairwells, tunnels, passage-  
ways, and flow barriers. Also think about the perimeters and access controls.

Hazard Checklist 348 Safe Operations  
Unfenced, unticketed, and oversold events often give rise to unsafe occupancy  
conditions, such as loads exceeding the limits, crowd density hazards, and audi-  
ence members seeking sight lines by climbing on something or going where  
they should not. In addition, fences and barriers should be designed to flex  
under pressure to prevent crowd crush injury, yet should not collapse and thus  
cause crowd collapse injuries. A possible exception is the use of breakaway stage  
skirts to prevent crowd surge injuries for stages with an underneath clearance of  
6% ft \(2m\).  
Finally, consider the activities that will take place and how these will increase  
or affect the possible hazards at the event. The use of alcohol often impairs judgment,  
which can turn minor hazards into major perils \(e.g., slip-and-trip hazards, rough  
terrain, unfamiliar layouts\) and might instigate inappropriate behavior \(e.g.,  
throwing debris or bottles, climbing onto structures or standing on seats for bet-  
ter vantage points, or even using chairs as weapons\). Loud music or noise \(e.g.,  
concerts or car races\) could require hearing protection for staff members. Special  
effects such as pyrotechnics and smoke or fog effects could create hazardous  
situations or leave hazardous materials \(the event site must always be searched for  
unexploded fireworks when a pyrotechnics show is over\).  
Job Site Safety  
“Everyone, from the event organizer to the suppliers to the volunteers, must be  
committed to a safe working environment and safe working practices and must  
be active participants in the commitment to on-the-job \(OT\]\) safety” \(Silvers  
2008, 95\). Robert Estrin recommends that you discuss safety practices with all  
subcontracted suppliers during the bid or proposal stage. “A significantly lower  
bid should be scrutinized for shortcuts that will compromise safety, such as fewer  
or less experienced workers, insufficient installation equipment, or older equip-  
ment that may need repair.” Talk with your vendors and suppliers about their  
safety policies and procedures. Question them about safety requirements par-  
ticular to their products or services. Become familiar with the rules, regulations,  
and precautions associated with on-the-job safety \(see Figure 12.9\). Make certain  
you have mandated job site safety with your staff as well, following safe lifting  
and carrying practices, never standing on a chair as a ladder, and using the right  
tools and equipment for the job.  
Another factor that compromises safety is the time allotment for installation  
and dismantling. Estrin observes, “When workers are rushing, particularly when  
they're carrying equipment, that’s when people get hurt.” Estrin contends that  
the breakdown and load-out should be choreographed as carefully \(and the pro-  
duction schedule for these activities should be just as detailed\) as the load-in  
and setup. Jerrold Gorrell \(2007\) identified several nonregulatory work hazards Safety

Develop Evacuation Plans to Avoid Panic  
An emergency is a critical moment when a situation or condition can turn into a  
catastrophe causing damage, losses, injuries, and/or fatalities. To protect life and  
limb in an emergency situation, there must be a specific, reasonable, and agreed-to  
plan of response that can be implemented efficiently and calmly. Although emer-  
gencies requiring evacuation are much less likely to occur than crowd conflicts,  
they have the greatest potential for crowd panic and injury. Adequately training  
employees to respond to major emergencies requires, first and foremost, the existence  
of an evacuation plan.  
An evacuation plan must include a hierarchy of decision makers, prearranged  
procedures, clear communication methods, and unobstructed routes. Many venues  
have evacuation plans specific to their facilities, with which you should become  
familiar and incorporate into the event planning. For sites without such plans,  
you will work with police, fire, venue, and other officials to develop the appropriate  
routes and protocols. Evacuation plans should be part of all staff briefings, and  
drills should be conducted if possible. 350 Safe Operations  
Berlonghi \(1990\) advises that there must be an agreed-to hierarchy of how, and  
by whom, an evacuation is decided upon. Once evacuation has been determined  
to be necessary, all event personnel should move to preassigned locations and all  
exits and gates should be opened. Security personnel and event staff should help  
to direct people at critical points along the evacuation route, and their demeanor  
will help to maintain a calm and orderly evacuation. Specific personnel may be  
assigned to aid in evacuating disabled and elderly persons. Traffic officials and  
parking personnel must be alerted as well, and they should also maintain a calm  
and authoritative demeanor.  
All means of egress must be unobstructed, well lit, and clearly identified with  
the proper signage, including doorways, hallways, corridors, passageways, balconies,  
enclosures, lobbies, escalators, ramps, stairs and stairwells, tunnels, courts, and  
yards. Elevators should not be used during an evacuation \(except by emergency  
response personnel\). All exits must be unlocked and capable of opening in the  
direction of escape, including exit doors equipped with panic hardware—latches  
that release upon the application of force in the direction of egress travel. In  
some cases, evacuees should be directed to predetermined gathering points at safe  
distances away from a building \(point of safety\) so it can be determined whether  
everyone has been evacuated from a structure. Once an evacuation has started it  
should not be halted, even if the original threat has been eliminated, because the  
chaos of a reverse flow can cause an even greater hazard. No one, except official  
emergency responders, should be allowed to reenter the venue for any reason.  
Pay Attention to the Audience  
The larger the audience \(and the more animated their anticipated behavior\), the  
more safety and security controls must considered. Many of the most severe disas-  
ters have occurred at events with very large audiences, and most of the deaths  
resulted from panic or crowding so closely that the victims were suffocated \(see  
Figure 12.10\). Mitigate this risk by incorporating safety features into the design  
and layout of the site, as well as the admissions controls established for the event.  
Obviously, a dignified audience at a classical concert will require fewer controls  
than a boisterous audience at a rock concert. However, emergencies requiring  
evacuation or mass movement of any crowd can become hazardous, no matter  
how dignified or sedate the event.  
You must pay attention to the actions and mood of the audience. If things  
seem to be getting too unruly, or specific segments of the crowd are instigating  
inappropriate behavior, then things must be calmed down. How this is to be  
accomplished also depends on the audience. For some events, simply the visibility  
of security personnel or authorities might suppress the action. For others, specific  
spectators or attendees might have to be ejected from the event. Safety 351  
Crowd Collapse A “falling domino” collapse of a crowd due to individuals at the front falling,  
causing those behind to sequentially lose their balance and fall on top.  
Crowd Craze A critical crowd pressure caused by the competitive rush or push of a crowd  
in pursuit of or toward a desirable objective or individual.  
Crowd Crush A critical crowd pressure caused by the compression of a crowd into a  
smaller and smaller area due to the absence of a portal or escape.  
Crowd Panic\* The frenzied movement to escape a real or perceived danger, often  
including the trampling of those who have fallen in the way.  
Crowd Surge A rapid compression movement in a particular direction caused by a variety  
of reasons.  
\*Recent studies suggest the term “panic” is a misnomer in that movement is a rational reaction, albeit fear-based, rather than an irrational response or hysteria \(Drury, Cocking, and Reicher, 2009\). Figure 12.10

\(Fruin 1993\)  
Crowd management practices must be applied throughout the duration of an  
event, from arrival \(if queues extend past a certain point, you open another service  
counter\) through departure \(adjust traffic signals to accommodate a mass exodus  
of vehicles\). The Health and Safety Executive \(1998\), advises that behavior is  
affected by the amount of information provided. “Poor communications can lead  
to people stopping, moving against the flow of the crowd, blocking passages or  
making frequent demands on staff for directions. Visitors without information,  
or given contradictory information, can become frustrated and aggressive.”  
Potential crowd movement hazards include reverse or cross flows in a dense crowd,  
flows obstructed by queues, crowds mixing with animals or traffic, and moving  
attractions within a crowd.  
Audience Welfare Services  
Attending to problems such as lost companions, children, parents, or possessions,  
and providing visitor guidance and gathering places for attendees are among the  
numerous ways you can and should attend to the welfare of the audience. These  
guest services must be coordinated with as much attention to safety and security  
as any other part of the event. Visitors to an event in unfamiliar surroundings  
might benefit from gentle reminders about specific messages and cautions regard-  
ing site features and foibles delivered over the public address systems, as well as with  
signage and printed materials. Caution signs should always be placed at specific  
hazards, particularly temporary hazards \(e.g., “Caution—Wet Floor’\).  
Areas designated for children who have lost their parents should be segregated,  
comfortably furnished, and staffed with cheerful personnel who can alleviate the  
stress of both child and parent. Depending on the type, scope, and jurisdiction 352 Safe Operations  
of the event, these staff members might need to have security checks performed  
before they are allowed to care for children, but, in most cases, “Mom-like” volun-  
teers are the most appropriate for soothing a frightened child. The sheer relief on  
the faces of parent and child will probably indicate the reunion successful; however,  
turning a child over to a “found” parent might need specific precautions, perhaps  
requiring the completion of and signing an incident report and collecting proof  
of identification. Other precautions include not giving the waiting child any food  
or beverage other than water \(because of potential allergies or dietary restrictions\),  
keeping the child confined to the designated area, and supervising the child through-  
out his or her confinement. A few toys and coloring books will help pass the time.  
William J. O'Toole, the Australia-based developer of the Event Project  
Management System \(www.epms.net\) and events development specialist  
for numerous countries in the Middle East, offers the following case study he  
uses in his workshops with experienced event managers.  
The event was an entertainment and educational event on cleanliness for  
children. There were over 1,000 children in the audience. “As is common in the  
Gulf countries, this event took place in the evening when it is cool and under  
a very large tent. There was a sound system and lights. All of this was run by a  
generator. As the night came the generator suddenly stopped.” What would  
you do?  
O'Toole says the first question to ask is “What is the result?” The lights go  
out and the sound system stops working. “This is an important step as most  
people do not realize what happens when an incident occurs. They tend to  
immediately go to what they will do.”  
The next question is, “How long do you have before the children panic?”  
Most teachers realize that this is a dangerous situation because the children  
can be easily scared and try to leave the venue.  
When this “what you would do” question is posed in his workshops, O’Toole  
says the answers are usually\:  
Use the back-up generator—“There was not one; the size of the event and  
the budget precluded hiring back-up systems.”  
Talk to the children—“The lack of a sound system means that only the chil-  
dren nearest will hear. It is quite possible that the children furthest away will  
be frightened because they can’t understand what is said.”  
continues Security  
353

Use the cell phone lights—“Once again, this can scare the children that  
don’t know why there are tiny lights in the darkness.”  
O'Toole notes, “It is surprising how people will never think it through. The  
point is that the event manager had a very short time to minimize the risk.  
She had to get through the next few minutes while the staff tried to start the  
generator or used another source of lights such as the cars nearby.”  
The event manager in this case knew exactly what to do because she was  
a teacher. “She started the children singing well-known songs. The children  
in the front began singing and it spread throughout the whole crowd. While  
the children were happily singing she was able to get her team to restart the  
generator.’  
# Security  
Security pertains to the protection of property from loss or damage, as differenti-  
ated from safety—the protection of people from harm—but it also pertains to the  
personnel used to perform both these functions. Security personnel are used to  
control admissions, crowds, and crime \(see Figure 12.11\). They also constitute a  
vital component linked with fire, first aid, and emergency personnel within any  
emergency response or crisis management plan.  
Develop the Security Plan  
The professional event coordinator must determine the security plan and personnel  
needed based on the type, scope, and objectives of the event being produced.  
A corporate product launch will have different needs than a charity fundraiser; a benefit  
concert will have different needs than a beach party. A large sports competition will

Personnel Functions 354 Safe Operations  
have different needs than a large cultural festival, and a government meeting will have  
different needs than a conference or incentive program’s final night gala.  
Security plans must be specifically developed for each and every event, even  
if the event has occurred many times before. There will always be new elements,  
new features, or new conditions that require a fresh look at the security needs. You  
might use a standard outline for developing a security plan, but each plan must  
be specific to the individual event. The security plan should be drafted using the  
risk assessment, site plan, organizational chart, program agenda, and contractual  
agreements to define what, where, when, why, and how people and property must  
be protected.  
The security plan starts with sensible \(and documented\) precautions such as  
limiting the number of keys or changing the locks to restricted areas or stor-  
age rooms, creating and positioning cautionary signage that is highly visible, and  
providing preevent communications with the audience about safety precautions,  
such as not wearing one’s conference badge outside the event \(to prevent targeting  
by entrepreneurial criminals\). The plan is then further developed in relation to  
specific risk factors identified in the risk assessment, and the allocation of sufh-  
cient funds to acquire the people and equipment necessary to perform the security  
functions identified.  
In the United States there are two different types of law to consider in rela-  
tion to security plans—criminal law, whereby offenders are arrested and might  
be incarcerated, and tort law, whereby offenders might be sued for damages due  
to negligence but are not put in jail. A written security plan becomes a strong  
offense in the commitment to safe operations, by both the removal of negligent  
civil liability and the prevention of criminal activity, and a strong defense against  
claims of negligence.  
Comfort versus Confrontation  
The type and demeanor of the security presence will communicate a message—  
comfort or confrontation. The appropriate attitude and authority should be  
established for all event security personnel, whether peer, private, or professional.  
Whether security personnel are used to conduct searches for controlled substances  
prior to admission, to guard and protect valuables, or to assist with emergencies,  
they are part of the event team and the event experience. One might think of this  
as a “stewarding” \(caretaker\) rather than “security” \(control\) function. The wrong  
attitude might provoke situations rather than prevent them.  
Security personnel and equipment can be almost invisible, semivisible, or  
highly visible, depending on the needs of the event, the potential risks, and the  
likely behaviors of the audience. You might need one type of security presence  
at one location, such as uniformed guards at the ticket window where money is Security  
355  
kept, and another type elsewhere, such as plainclothes personnel in the backstage  
areas. Security that is almost invisible, such as surveillance equipment or plain-  
clothes personnel roving the event grounds, might be all that is needed at events  
where there are few risks. Semivisible security personnel, such as roving peer or  
volunteer security in “friendly” T-shirts and uniformed personnel at restricted  
area entrances, will likely be sufficient for many large events with uncontroversial  
activities and sedate audiences. Highly visible security might be required at events  
that have a reputation or potential for violence or criminal activity, such as the  
expectation of gang attendance or industrial espionage.  
Employ and Deploy the Appropriate Security  
Security personnel and equipment must be employed and deployed in a manner  
that suits and serves the purpose, goals, and objectives of the event \(see Figure 12.12\).  
You want the right people, of the right level of authority, at the right places, at  
the right times. Your personnel options include plainclothes, uniformed \(either in  
uniform or event-specific attire\), and sworn \(those authorized to carry a weapon  
and make arrests\), or a combination \(e.g., Secret Service personnel or bodyguards  
might be both plainclothes and sworn; police are both uniformed and sworn\).  
When hiring security personnel from a private contractual company, you must  
be diligent about specifying the needs of the event and the training criteria for the  
personnel assigned to the event, as well as checking the references of the security  
company awarded the contract. Some security companies do not perform back-  
ground checks on employees or provide appropriate training—they just provide  
people in uniform, some of whom are even convicted felons. As with all your  
suppliers, research complaints and reliability with better business organizations  
and colleagues, check the company’s references, specify levels of expertise in your  
request for proposal \(RFP\), require a certificate of insurance and a copy of its

advises you also ask to see the company’s policies and procedures manual \(includ-  
ing its hiring/screening policies\), outlines of its training and briefing activities,  
and its sample deployment assignment sheets and job descriptions.  
Incorporate the security chain of command into your communications plan,  
and centralize security supervision within your command center, including super-  
visory personnel from each type of security service included at the event \(peer,  
private, personal, and law enforcement\). It is vitally important to create a network  
of interagency cooperation, particularly in terms of emergency response, and to  
respect each entity's hierarchy. In addition, if hiring a private security company,  
you must limit your liability and maximize the company’s accountability by leaving  
the management and supervision of its personnel to its supervisors.  
Security Equipment  
There are a variety of technologies that the professional event coordinator might  
use within the context of security operations, ranging from golf carts for getting  
around the event site or bicycles for getting through the event site, to metal and  
motion detectors for screening entrants or protecting storage areas \(see Figure  
12.13\). Communications are facilitated by using two-way radios, cellular phones,  
and, for noisy environments, headsets, earphones, and hand or collar microphones.  
Supervisory personnel should have multichannel radios with dedicated channels  
so that they can communicate with different command groups or with emergency  
personnel separately. All security personnel should be issued or have access to sup-  
plies for taking notes, incident or accident forms to be filled out should something  
occur, and a camera to document a scene. Roving security personnel should have  
flashlights so they can check all areas of the event site, even under the grandstands.  
Screening of individuals at admission points can include passive and active search  
methods. Passive search methods include the use of handheld or walk-through  
metal detectors \(magnetometers\) and X-ray screening for packages or baggage.

Security personnel involved in active search methods should be carefully trained  
in the appropriate pat-down or other personal search techniques and the correct  
procedures for searching handbags, backpacks, and other personal belongings.  
In conducting pat-down checks, there should be female security personnel avail-  
able to search female entrants. Personnel searching belongings should always wear  
protective gloves.  
Remote or passive security options include surveillance equipment such as  
closed-circuit television \(CCTV\), cameras, and motion detectors, plus the use  
of intrusion alarms to alert personnel of unauthorized entry. When using pas-  
sive or covert surveillance equipment, you could be required to post warning  
signs. A camera can be an effective security tool, but there are rules about where,  
when, and how you are allowed to use it. However, it can be a labor-saving device  
because it allows one or two people to observe and monitor multiple locations  
constantly and concurrently, and, combined with recording capabilities, can provide  
objective evidence.  
Briefing and Training  
With all security personnel, even law enforcement, it is important to conduct  
briefings to review the expectations surrounding the event. Particularly with peer  
or volunteer security personnel, you must convey the fact that they are there to  
prevent incidents or accidents, not to watch the event. You must also understand  
that you cannot expect these individuals to jeopardize their own safety. You must  
specify when, how, and why they must call law enforcement authorities. You must  
also specify the limits of their authority.  
You should conduct security personnel briefings just prior to the event. Briefings  
can also include representatives of emergency response agencies and should address  
the following points\:  
° Site and deployment—FEveryone needs to know the layout of the event and  
where he or she is to be deployed within that layout, including entrances,  
exits, first aid stations, and potential hazards. \(If you are telling personnel to  
go to Door D17 to assist with an incident or emergency, they need to know  
which door is D17.\) Individuals should be issued credentials and uniforms  
immediately prior to going on duty.  
¢ Schedule—This item includes the opening and closing times for the event  
and specific areas or activities within the event \(parking areas, admission  
gates, concessions, etc.\), as well as anticipated major crowd movements  
\(intermissions, breaks, entertainment attractions, etc.\) and VIP or high-profile  
guest movements. It also includes the schedules for overnight or after-hours  
security \(including specification of who is authorized to enter the site during  
these time periods\). 358 Safe Operations  
\* Chain of command and communication— I his item includes instructions on to  
whom and how to report incidents or observations, identification of key security  
personnel \(supervisors, zone captains, stewards, or other hierarchy\) and other  
department heads, and issuance of communications and other equipment.  
\* Scope of duties and authority— This item includes deployment assignments,  
job responsibilities, and clear directions on the management of unacceptable  
behavior. If personnel have authority to detain or arrest, the procedures  
for these actions must be clearly specified. Excessive force and/or abuse of  
authority should not take place.  
\* Specific risk factors—Review any unique risks or hazards pertaining to the par-  
ticular event or site and any special instructions regarding specific risk factors.  
¢ Emergency procedures—Personnel must be instructed as to protocols for  
raising alarms, requesting assistance, and evacuation, as well as the operation  
or deactivation of any equipment, mechanisms, machinery, or utilities necessary  
in an emergency.  
The event organization might need or be required to provide training in addi-  
tion to the instruction on the aforementioned briefing points, including the use  
of specific equipment, filling out incident/accident forms, credential verification,  
observation techniques, how to conduct searches, and the procedures for han-  
dling disruptive or intoxicated individuals. This training and all security person-  
nel briefings should be infused with customer service training, including social  
and communication skills, to ensure the appropriate attitude, demeanor, and  
conduct. In addition to the security personnel, all staff and volunteers should be  
briefed on the response procedures for incidents, accidents, fires, evacuations, and  
other crisis situations.  
Lockup, Lockdown, and Lost and Found  
There are often a variety of materials and equipment that should be secured in  
storage areas under lock and key, including electronics, personal computers, two-  
way radios, personal effects, and other valuables. Work with the security team to  
determine the appropriate storage locations, locking mechanisms, and protocols  
for checking these items out and back in to reduce the possibility of loss or dam-  
age. There are also a variety of equipment and/or décor items that must be secured  
in place with locking mechanisms, such as vehicles on display, trailer-mounted  
equipment, or computers used for registration. Locking covers, chains and pad-  
locks, or standard bicycle locks might be used to secure items to unmovable or  
awkward-to-move objects.  
A walk-through checking procedure should be established for closing down the  
event overnight to make certain the site or facility is empty and securely locked  
down, including all areas and access doors. For multiday events, you should also Medical and Emergency Services  
359  
work with the security personnel to define the possible concerns regarding vulner-  
able areas and property, perhaps even changing their inspection routes and timing  
periodically. Overnight security personnel should be provided with a list of any  
people authorized to enter the site while it is closed, as well as a list of contact  
numbers for the professional event coordinator and/or those with authority to  
grant after-hours access.  
The location and procedures for lost and found items should be established and  
incorporated into the site and security plans, as well as communicated to the audi-  
ence through the event's printed collateral materials and signage. The holding area  
can be as simple as a box under the registration or information counter, or found  
items might be placed in a secured storage area. It is not usually recommended  
that you make announcements when items are found, but if they are, make cer-  
tain you do not give a too-detailed description in the announcement—leave out  
some unique descriptive information that the claimant must give to identify the  
item as his or her property. Claimants should fill out and sign a receipt when an item  
has been returned. You should also predetermine what will be done with items  
found that have not been claimed by the end of the event \(e.g., donated to charity,  
turned over to the police, etc.\). .  
Medical and Emergency Services  
No matter how well designed, planned, and implemented the event program  
or event site, there is always the possibility of a crisis or emergency that can  
endanger the people attending, participating in, or working at an event. The  
professional event coordinator must always consider the possibility of a medi-  
cal incident, fire, or disorderly \(dangerous\) conduct among the audience. These  
incidents might be precipitated by unsafe conditions or ill-advised or illegal  
activities. They might be caused by calculated rebellion or sheer exuberance.  
They could be the result of malicious behavior or caused by Mother Nature.  
The level of normal response required by the event organization will depend on  
the context of the event \(the purpose, scope, site, and audience\) and will have  
an impact on the event’s site, budget, and operations. The level of emergency  
response will depend on the incident.  
Medical Services  
Given that many public events concentrate an audience population equal to or  
greater than that of a small municipality in a single location, it is reasonable to  
assume that there will be incidents of injury or illness \(see Figure 12.14\). Establish  
procedures and provisions for dealing with these incidents, large or small, and  
secure the on-site medical services appropriate for the type, scope, and audience 360

Incidents at Events  
demographics of the event. It is important to remember that no matter how  
minor or severe the injury or illness is medically, it can be extremely severe to the  
person experiencing it.  
You should liaison with venue officials, the sponsoring host or organization,  
and local health authorities or ambulance services early in the planning process to  
determine the protocols and procedures for dealing with medical incidents and  
emergencies that might occur at the event. This includes identifying the distance  
to the nearest 24-hour hospital, medical center, or trauma center that will be the  
receptive medical facility for major or mass casualties. The distances and direc-  
tions from the event site to all area hospitals, as well as the response times to the  
event site for ambulances, should also be determined.  
In some jurisdictions, only certain medical facilities are certified as trauma  
centers and all medical emergencies are transported to those facilities. In  
other jurisdictions, there might be overlapping medical emergency response  
services and facilities, and you might need to coordinate with these entities  
to define the jurisdiction for your event within the mutual aid plans of public  
safety agencies. For large or public events, you should notify the designated  
medical facility or facilities, in writing, of the event, giving all pertinent  
information \(i.e., date\(s\), hours of operation, expected attendance, types of  
activities, etc.\).  
Preevent communications with the event’s audience and participants may  
include, depending on the event, advisories on weather conditions and envi-  
ronmental conditions \(terrain, flora, and fauna\), suggestions as to suitable  
clothing, promotions for responsible drinking, and/or information about the  
level of and procedures for on-site medical care. On-site communications Medical and Emergency Services  
361  
should include the location\(s\) of facilities and health-care advice on signage  
and printed materials, as well as public announcement scripts advising people  
what to do and where to go for on-site medical attention. Sports events may  
need to collect specific medical information from team members or partici-  
pants and provide specific medical personnel or facilities. International events  
might need to advise international visitors regarding the transport and/or  
refilling of prescription medications.  
Level of Services  
The level of on-site and off-site medical care \(see Figure 12.15\) is determined  
by the size, demographics, and expected behaviors of the event population  
\(including attendees, participants, staff, volunteers, and others\), as well as the  
specific health risks associated with the event activities and event site. Obviously,  
the riskier the activities or the terrain, the more likely it is that someone will expe-  
rience an injury, and the older the event population, the more likely that someone  
will experience an illness.

\(Continued\)  
First and foremost and for all events, check with staff and volunteers to deter-  
mine who has training in first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation \(CPR\), and the  
Heimlich maneuver, and make certain a fully stocked first aid kit is included in  
the event equipment \(see Appendix 4\). Information about communicable diseases  
and viruses should be included in the staff briefing or volunteer orientation, and  
first aid personnel should be required to notify the event coordinator if numerous  
similar cases of gastrointestinal distress are reported within a short time \(indicat-  
ing the possible contamination of food, air, or the water supply\). Levels of on-site  
medical care beyond a first aid kit differ, depending on the event. It is prudent to  
consult with local public safety and/or health services for the requirements for the  
event, based on its unique characteristics.  
An on-site first aid post, station, room, or tent should preferably be positioned  
so that it is accessible within five minutes from any location within the event site.  
It must be visible, well lit, with signage giving directions to it throughout the  
event site. It should be in as quiet a location as possible, sheltered from the ele-  
ments, and designed or laid out to provide patient privacy and personal dignity.  
A first aid station should also have a place for a sick or injured person to lie down.  
Determine how help will be summoned by/for a sick or injured person and how  
the patient will be extricated and transported to the first aid station. First aiders  
might carry stretchers or a special golf cart might be equipped with a litter to  
move injured patrons to the first aid station, or it might be possible \(or necessary\)  
to treat or begin treatment for some cases on the spot. A four-wheel-drive vehicle  
might be needed if the terrain is unsuitable for golf cart or ambulance access. Medical and Emergency Services 363

Emergency Response  
An emergency is any condition endangering, or thought to be endangering, life  
or property requiring urgent response \(see Figure 12.16\). The first 30 minutes  
of a situation are the most dangerous; therefore, it is critical that the appropriate  
emergency response agency 1s contacted and arrives at the scene to respond to the  
situation in a timely manner. A disaster—natural, human-made, or technological—  
can involve mass casualties and major losses. It is important for the professional  
event coordinator to prepare for this possibility by understanding both the external  
hazards and those specific to the activity or nature of the event itself.  
Emergency response agencies provide law enforcement, rescue, fire suppression,  
emergency medical care, disaster assistance, special operations, and other forms  
of hazard control and mitigation. They include public, government, private, for-  
profit and not-for-profit, industrial, or military organizations. Most communities  
have well-established emergency response plans dictating the specific actions to  
be performed by all personnel who are expected to respond during an emergency,  
including the use of communication systems, security of the scene, and traffic  
control. You must establish the protocols for the identification of an emergency  
and the notification of the appropriate or lead emergency response agencies.  
Prepare a list of agencies you are to contact or notify should an emergency or  
disaster occur, which include, among others, the following\:  
¢ Police \* Hospital/medical facility  
e Ambulance service ¢ Search and rescue service  
¢ Fire department \* Coast Guard or marine authority  
You should also establish the charges and liability for charges for emergency  
response services \(what they will cost and who is to pay\).  
Creating an emergency action plan \(EAP\) is one of the facets of the due dili-  
gence required when organizing a gathering of people in a particular place, at a  
Figure 12.16  
Potential Emergencies  
and Disasters 364 Safe Operations  
particular time, for a particular purpose \(Silvers 2008\). It should be included as  
part of your overall event plan and presented to your internal or external clients  
\(as appropriate\) in the same context as your site selection recommendations, food  
and beverage plan, admittance controls, event activities, and other logistics. Every  
purpose-built venue you use should have an EAP in place; if none is in place, one  
must be devised. Although some venues are reluctant to provide you with a copy  
of their internal document because it often includes confidential, sensitive, and/or  
proprietary information, you must be adamant about discussing these issues with  
them in the early planning stages\:  
° Include a checklist in your RFP that addresses both general emergency  
preparedness and your specific concerns or the range of threats you have  
identified.  
¢ Request a fact sheet that covers the basics, including the emergencies they  
are prepared to handle, the procedures for an evacuation or medical emergency,  
and contact numbers for security, fire, police, and other emergency responders  
as well as area hospitals.  
\* Coordinate and integrate your and their EAPs in a way that clearly establishes  
how roles, responsibilities, and authority are to be delegated should an  
emergency occur.  
¢ Communicate with the local emergency response authorities for guidance,  
instructions, and support \(and so they will be aware of your presence\).  
Emergency Site Access and Egress  
Of critical importance in an emergency or disaster situation is access and egress  
for the responding services and their equipment, as well as the identification of  
the specific location of the emergency within the event site. Fire officials recom-  
mend the creation of a grid map of the site, including an overview of the vicinity  
with numbered and lettered squares superimposed on it to provide fixed reference  
points for all locations within the area. You might need to provide special areas of  
access within your site plan, including marshaling areas for emergency response  
vehicles and equipment, a staging area where they may be organized, a sheltered  
triage area for casualties, or even a helicopter pad or landing strip \(an empty road\)  
for aeromedical response.  
Work with law enforcement or fire officials to establish the emergency response  
site requirements for your event. These can include the access routes, designated  
or dedicated perimeter roads or streets, designated and dedicated parking areas,  
and segregated routes for responding services, audience evacuation, and casualty  
removal. You might be required to have certain emergency response personnel sta-  
tioned on-site, such as fire personnel if pyrotechnics are included, or rescue divers  
if an underwater activity is conducted. All on-site emergency or medical response Wrap Up  
365  
personnel must be provided with the access credentials or protocols that will allow  
them to get wherever they need to go.  
Prepare for the Worst and Practice Your Plan  
People have been injured at the safest event sites. People have died at the smallest  
of celebrations. Think everything through to the worst possible conclusion so you  
will be prepared to deal with any situation that does occur. This preparation can  
arguably be the difference between an amateur event coordinator and a professional  
one. The consideration of and planning for the health, safety, and welfare of the  
people involved in an event under any and all circumstances is a cornerstone of  
professional event coordination.  
You must seek out the officials and authorities who can provide the right direction;  
allocate the proper resources to secure the requisite equipment and services; create  
the plans; and provide the right tools, training, and practice so that your staff and  
volunteers will be able to respond in the appropriate manner should an incident  
occur. These plans provide the protocols and procedures for all contingencies so  
that decisions and actions will be effective. This training and practice allows your  
staff and volunteers to become desensitized to the panic of the moment and react  
correctly without hesitation.  
Wrap Up  
Every event has vulnerabilities that must be considered and controlled in order  
to provide a safe, secure, and healthy environment for those creating, installing,  
operating, and attending the event. The type and scope of these hazards will vary  
according to the size and nature of the event, its site, its activities, and those  
in attendance. The professional event coordinator performs a risk assessment to  
identify problem areas, evaluates available options, and creates prevention, contin-  
gency, and emergency action plans that will mitigate the consequences should an  
incident occur. These action plans should include the triggers to indicate imple-  
mentation, the actions to be taken if implemented, and the individuals who will  
be responsible, as well as the procurement of the appropriate insurance coverage.  
The professional event coordinator sets the tone for safe operations with a  
strong commitment to safety, which must be infused throughout the event team  
of staff and suppliers. The appropriate communications protocols and technology  
support this safety mandate, as well as help to provide a quality experience within  
the context of any occurrence or incident that might take place at the event.  
Security personnel, whether peer or professional, are employed and deployed  
to protect people and property and to offer a sense of care and well-being for 366 Safe Operations  
event-goers. There is a mandate for all security personnel, staff, and volunteers  
to be vigilant observers of the conditions and conduct that can lead to unsafe  
situations. ‘  
Illness or injuries are possible at any event, no matter the type or size or audi-  
ence. Responding to medical incidents, whether minor or major, must be factored  
into planning the event site, budget, and operations to provide the appropriate  
level of care. Coordination and cooperation with emergency response agencies is  
critical in order to be prepared for the worst that could happen. Although disas-  
ters and mass casualties are not usual at events, they must be planned for never-  
theless. Attention to these important facets of professional event coordination  
separates the amateurs from the experts.  
REVIEW CHECKPOINTS  
1. How do you determine the appropriate action plans should something occur,  
change, or become unavailable?  
2. Whoare the likely stakeholders that need to be included in the communications  
surrounding an event?  
3. Whois responsible for on-the-job safety? Why?  
4. What are the similarities and differences between safety issues and security  
issues?  
5. How does one determine what level of medical services should be provided  
on-site at an event?  
EXERCISES IN PROFESSIONAL EVENT COORDINATION  
Outline and describe the safety and security plans, including on-site communica-  
tions and medical services, for each of the following events.  
A. You are coordinating a training program for 800 regional sales managers of  
a high-tech corporation. The program will include proprietary information  
on the company’s newest product lines and the marketing strategies for the  
upcoming year, something its competitors would do anything to get a look  
at. The program presentations will include significant AV installations and  
the rigging of complex and heavy decorative displays throughout the meet-  
ing space, including in the ceiling.  
B. The executive director of an association for which you coordinate the annual  
conference for 5,000 attendees has just informed you that she has gotten an  
affirmative response to her invitation to your country’s head of state. He or Wrap Up  
367  
she will appear at the opening session of your upcoming conference to give  
a short but internationally significant speech, which means that there will be  
a small army of local, national, and international media to cover it.  
Cc. You have been hired to coordinate a charity gala to benefit a children’s  
hospital. The guest list of 300 includes celebrities from stage and screen,  
dignitaries from city and state government, and executives from the top  
corporations in the country. The site selected for this evening of dining, dancing,  
and a special appearance by a world-renowned musician is the rooftop of  
the hospital itself.

# Volunteers  
A volunteer may forget the words you use, but will  
never forget how you make them feel.  
——Gloria Nelson, CSEP American event designer  
In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
e Identify, solicit, and select the appropriate vendor partners for an event.  
e Develop successful recruitment programs and collateral materials for  
procuring volunteers and support staff for an event.  
e Design and deliver effective orientation and training programs that  
prepare personnel to shape the success of the event.  
e Utilize, motivate, and reward personnel in a manner that benefits  
both the individual and the event.  
e Monitor and manage voluntary, paid, and contracted personnel,  
using sound supervisory techniques, performance reviews, and  
appropriate conflict resolution and disciplinary procedures.  
369 ane event coordinator was meeting with her various department leaders and com-  
mittee chairpersons after the event they had all been working on, to discuss the  
overall staffing for the event. One of the department leaders said that he had had  
some “real dead wood" in his group—people who did not do their jobs but spent  
- most of their time complaining about the event organization. The event coordinator  
suggested the department leader talk with these people to find out why they had

Everyone who works on an event, whether paid or volunteer, part-time or full-  
time, vendor or participant, brings a lifetime’s worth of experience and expertise  
that can contribute to the success of the event. The professional event coordi-  
nator must incorporate the appropriate mechanisms to take advantage of that  
wealth while meeting the needs and expectations of those providing it. The pro-  
cess begins with finding the right people and providers for the event, based on  
the needs of the event operations and the resources available to fill those needs,  
followed by sharing the vision and requirements of the event with all involved  
personnel and providers, ensuring that they fully understand what is expected of  
them and what they will be provided with in return. Finally, the professional event  
coordinator must supply the tools and training necessary for them to be successful  
in whatever capacity they serve the event, within a motivational environment that  
recognizes the value each individual brings to the event. Communication is the  
foundation of success in all these tasks.  
Vendor Selection  
Virtually every event or event organization, no matter how big or small, will at  
one time or another purchase goods and/or services from a variety of vendors  
\(see Figure 13.1\). The types of goods and services required. will depend on the  
type and scope of the event as well as its fiscal, organizational, geographical, and Vendor Selection

logistical parameters. The professional event coordinator must set up an equitable  
method for soliciting, evaluating, and selecting the right vendors for the event  
project at hand. This may be accomplished by establishing a purchasing program  
that streamlines the process through a systematic approach that relies on sound  
assessment criteria. In the world of project management, a purchasing system is  
referred to as procurement management, illustrated in Figure 13.2. 372 Vendors and Volunteers  
Analyze Your Needs and Resources  
Specify the needs to be filled and the resources available to fill them. For many  
products and/or services, there is a broad range of product types and quality levels  
available to meet a particular need—for example, paper plates versus designer  
china or stick-on paper badges versus smart cards. In determining the resources  
available for the event, you must consider time, money, and personnel. There  
might be a sufficient budget but very little time or few personnel to handle certain  
aspects of the event. There might be plenty of volunteers but very little money.  
These resources must be allocated effectively and efficiently, so certain tasks or  
products might be outsourced rather than handled or produced in-house.  
Once you have determined the needs to be filled by outside vendors, itemize  
the goods and services required and locate the potential vendors or suppliers qual-  
ified to provide them. You might search directories, such as a telephone directory  
and membership directories, for organizations such as the International Special  
Events Society \(ISES\), Meeting Professionals International \(MPI\), convention  
and visitor bureaus, or chambers of commerce; look through periodicals such  
as Special Events magazine or Event Solutions magazine \(both of which publish  
annual resource guide issues\); network with colleagues; and search the Internet.  
You should continually seek out new vendor resources to build an ongoing database  
of qualified suppliers.  
Determine Selection Criteria  
The specifications for each product or service to be purchased, outsourced, or con-  
tracted must be determined, as well as the criteria to be used to evaluate bids and  
proposals. Specifications might include brand names, dimensions, features, quali-  
ties, quantities, and any other specification important to the success of the event.  
The more detailed and precise you are with the specifications, the more quality  
control you will have because such precision will lessen the possibility of receiving  
inferior materials or services. You must remember that you are now the customer.  
Evaluation criteria might be objective \(e.g., lowest price or holds a specific  
license or certification\) or subjective \(e.g., creative approach or demonstrated  
experience with similar events\) and could include such assessment factors as  
capabilities, creativity, delivery systems, design, equipment, experience, features,  
financial stability, geographic proximity, price, qualifications, quantities, and/or  
staffing levels. Depending on your event organization or your client’s corporate  
structure, you might also include such criteria as payment schedules \(e.g., pay-  
ment upon delivery or net 60 days\), special preferences given \(e.g., women- or  
minority-owned companies\), professional affiliations, environmental programs,  
quality management standards, and so forth. You might create a screening system  
wherein certain specifications are established as minimum criteria that must be Vendor Selection  
373  
met for a bid or proposal to be considered \(e.g., applicable licenses, insurance  
coverage, or scope of experience\).  
Solicit Bids and Proposals  
Once you have determined the specifications and qualified sources, you must  
prepare the procurement documents and solicit bids and proposals from prospec-  
tive sellers. Although the terms bid and proposal are often used interchangeably, in  
project management these are distinctly different. “The terms bid and quotation  
are generally used when the source selection decision will be based on price \(as  
when buying commercial or standard items\), while the term proposal is generally  
used when other considerations, such as technical skills or \[creative\] approach, are  
paramount” \(Project Management Institute 2000, 153\). The standard procure-  
ment documents for event products and services include the request for proposal  
\(RFP\) and the request for quotation \(RFQ\), or a tender brief.  
Many event professionals recommend that all projects or purchases should be  
put out for three bids every time to ensure competitive pricing. For many prod-  
ucts or materials, you simply call various suppliers for a price quote based on  
the precise specifications you have established. However, if there is significant  
latitude in the levels of quality combined with service and/or creative approaches,  
it is wise to issue an RFP or RFQ. When creating an RFP or RFQ, you should  
include certain information in the procurement documents in order to secure  
complete and comparable \(apples to apples\) responses\:  
¢ Specify the scope, expectations, and outcomes.  
¢ Outline the specifications, requirements, and restrictions.  
Put the project in context.  
Identify the budget parameters.  
¢ Define the selection criteria and deadlines.  
¢ Ask for \(and check\) references.  
It is important to include sufficient time in the schedule to solicit and evaluate bids  
or proposals to select the best vendors for the event, so that this process can be con-  
ducted in a comprehensive manner and will not be flawed because of time pressures.  
Establish a procurement process that provides equal access to all qualified bid-  
ders. This is not to say that you might be conducting prescreening to qualify  
bidders, and that this timing might affect the times when an RFP or tender brief  
would then be issued to individual bidders, but all bidders should have the same  
information and the same deadline for submitting their bids/proposals, after  
which the bids will be reviewed and the selection made. This is an ethics issue and  
could become a legal issue should an unsuccessful bidder discover any inequities  
and bring a lawsuit. Prevent this possible outcome by establishing, documenting, 374  
Vendors and Volunteers  
and enforcing a procurement system that includes equitable selection criteria and  
equal opportunity.  
Assess Capabilities, Competition, and Compliance  
Prepare an evaluation instrument that allows you to quickly assess the capabilities  
of a seller, and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the bid documents or  
proposals submitted in a manner that minimizes personal preference or preju-  
dice. Your objective is to select reputable, dependable, and competitive vendors or  
suppliers. You must confirm the seller’s ability to deliver the products and/or ser-  
vices proposed in the qualities, quantities, and manner in which you need them.  
You must make certain the bid includes all costs associated with the delivery and  
implementation of the product/service, and you must make certain the seller is  
qualified legally and ethically to provide the product/service.  
The evaluation instrument should have the various criteria weighted in relation  
to their priority in the decision-making process so that you will be able to rank the  
bids or proposals submitted. For example, if price is most important, it should be  
weighted more heavily than the quality of equipment or the quantity of staffing  
proposed, but, as noted throughout this book, using the lowest price alone is rarely a

What do clients base their decision on when choosing which event agency  
to go with? Colja M. Dams, CEO of VOK DAMS GRUPPE, has the answer to that  
question. “After analyzing our response to RFPs within the last five years we  
came up with the C-Model.”  
e Creativity—Did the agency understand me and is this the creativity  
level | am looking for?  
e Costs—Do | believe they quoted me good market prices, or are they  
over- or underselling?  
e Capability—Do | trust the agency to fulfill the task at hand?  
e Credibility—Do they have a proven track record?  
e Chemistry—Are these the people | trust and want to work together with?  
e CO2—Do they offer me a true sustainable green event?  
Dams notes, “In times of recession, Costs play a more and more important  
role, and for long programs—where the clientis working closely with the agency  
for months and months—clients tend to decide mainly on the Chemistry level.” Vendor Selection  
375  
sound strategy for selecting suppliers and can be more costly in the long run. By mak-  
ing price just one of several criteria, you will be able to select the best products and/  
or services at the best price. The evaluation instrument is used to select a supplier or  
prepare your negotiation sequence based on the rank order of the proposals received.  
Tum, Norton, and Wright \(2006, 117\) advise you to carefully consider supply  
chain management when selecting vendors. “Supply chain management is a holis-  
tic approach that stretches forward across the event manager’s own organization  
to the client and customers, and backwards through the many different suppliers  
and to their suppliers.” It is important to recognize that, as the saying goes, a chain  
is only as strong as its weakest link. Therefore, it’s important to know how reliable  
your suppliers’ suppliers are. Make certain you check the solvency of suppliers of  
any mission-critical goods or services so that you will be less likely to lose a key  
supplier right before the event.  
Issue and Manage Contracts  
Once a vendor has been selected, you must issue and manage the appropriate  
contractual documents, which might include a contract, letter of understanding,  
engagement agreement, purchase order, change orders, and seller invoices. These  
documents must specify the deliverables and schedules, as well as the terms and  
conditions of the buyer-seller relationship. These must be integrated into the  
overall event plans and timelines.  
When the event is over and/or the products or services have been delivered,  
you must administratively close out the contracts \(secure final invoices, issue final  
payments, and finalize documentation\) and evaluate the vendor's performance as  
well as the buyer-seller relationship. Would you use this vendor again? Why or  
why not? The more information you can iriclude in your review and your data-  
base, the easier it will be the next time you are seeking qualified vendors, and you  
will have a better idea of what to expect from this vendor in future dealings.  
Procurement management becomes exponentially more important as the  
scope of purchasing increases. Frank Supovitz, the National Football League's  
senior vice-president of events, has a staff of 27 that organizes dozens of events  
ON-SITE INSIGHT  
a year throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom. These include  
sports events such as the Super Bowl, Pro Bowl, NFL International Series, and  
NFL Playoffs, as well as television events such as the NFL Draft, business events  
such as NFL Owner Méetings, and numerous youth football events.  
continues 376 Vendors and Volunteers  
Supovitz notes that, although he cannot reveal the total amount spent each  
year \(“but, as you can imagine, it’s a lot”\), the range of goods and services his  
department procures includes “everything imaginable, including hotels, trans-  
portation services, meeting services, technology, live production, television  
production, field maintenance, facilities, promotional items, merchandise, labor,  
construction supplies, office supplies, fencing, furniture, vehicles, apparel, food  
| and beverage, telecommunications and information technologies. . .etc., etc.”  
| He says that the methods they use to locate vendors to supply these goods  
and services depend on the event. “At Super Bowl, for example, we work  
with the local host committee to manage an emerging business database  
of certified minority and woman-owned businesses and instruct our staff,  
contractors, and partners to use it to locate resources in the community. We  
have an RFP process for contracts large and small, and a number of vendors  
with whom we have long-standing relationships in areas where institutional  
knowledge of a particular event is of paramount importance.”  
Supovitz says that although cost is a major factor when selecting vendors,  
it is certainly not the only one. “Where applicable, experience in doing simi-  
lar work on a similar scale is important, and reputation—we definitely check  
references! Finally, insurability and maintenance of sufficient levels of liability  
coverage are key considerations.” Supovitz notes that the type of agreement  
varies, but “every procurement transaction has some form of written trail.”  
Vendors supplying goods and services to NFL events might have to comply  
with certain restrictions or policies, depending on the nature of the transac-  
tion, product, and/or service. These can include, among others, “work-for-hire”  
agreements wherein the work product is the property of the NFL; confidential-  
ity agreements; adherence to NFL's travel/entertainment policies; the require-  
ment to participate in the NFLU’s environmental program for material reuse,  
recycling, food recovery, and reduction of greenhouse gases; high levels of  
liability insurance and indemnification; work/change order advance approvals;  
and prohibition on using the NFL or its marks in corporate advertising.  
When asked what the most unusual product or service he’s ever had to pro-  
cure was, Supovitz answered, “I've learned that there is nothing new, original,  
or unusual out there. But, | did learn a lot about sand from a sandcastle builder  
from the West Coast. Did you know that the best sand grains for sculpting are  
cucumber shaped, and there's none of that in Hawaii? You actually have to ship  
in sand from somewhere else if you want to build a sand sculpture. Who knew?” Volunteers and Support Staffing  
377  
Volunteers and Support Staffing  
The professional event coordinator uses many of the same strategies included in  
the procurement process or purchasing system when staffing an event with paid  
and volunteer human resources\: planning, sourcing, soliciting, selecting, and eval-  
uating performance. Depending on the type and scope of the event, you might be  
using a handful or hundreds or thousands of people to bring an event to life, and  
your ability to identify staffing needs and the needs of those who will meet those  
staffing needs will result in a rewarding experience for everyone involved.  
ltemize Your Needs  
Large jobs are accomplished by completing small tasks. Identify the tasks to be  
accomplished by internal support staff and volunteers, as well as the number of  
personnel needed for each task area or team. This calculation will depend on the  
balance of other resources \(time, money, space, etc.\) and the types of tasks to be  
accomplished. These needs should be grouped into task areas within the organi-  
zational chart \(as discussed in Chapter 12\), then the current volunteer leaders or  
staff supervisors should be asked to estimate their human resource needs, based  
on past performance, strengths and weaknesses, and the scope of work to be done.  
Staffing needs will also be based on demand, which will fluctuate according to  
peak times throughout the duration of the event \(Bowdin, et al. 2006\). In regard  
to the size of a volunteer corps, Armstrong \(2001, 80\) notes, “Consider building  
size and redundancy \[because\] the work almost always expands beyond the origi-  
nal scope, and some volunteers will leave the project or disappoint in other ways.”  
Krug \(2000, 137\) recommends scheduling “at least 30 percent more volunteers  
than needed to cover the assigned tasks.”  
Stuffing envelopes is different from decorating, and selling tickets is different  
from data entry. Some people are better at and prefer paperwork, and others pre-  
fer “people work”—interacting with event guests or visitors. Determine the skill  
sets required by those who will fill task area needs, such as administrative skills,  
organizational skills, manual skills, technical skills, and interpersonal skills. The  
advantage of this approach is flexibility to allocate people according to their abili-  
ties and preferences and to create cross-functional teams using comparable skill  
sets plus cross training.  
Create Job Descriptions  
It is nearly impossible to effectively allocate your human resources, either paid or  
volunteer, until you have job descriptions for the various tasks and task areas. A  
job description should include the job title, a summary of the duties, the required  
qualifications or skill sets, the hours of work or time commitment, and, if 378  
Vendors and Volunteers  
appropriate, the compensation, including benefits and/or entitlements. It should  
also identify the level of responsibility and authority and the specific conditions  
or constraints applicable, such as minimum qualifications, security checks, or  
grooming and dress codes. Horowitz \(1999, 131\) advises that job descriptions  
should be realistic definitions of what you want and need, not wish lists, and that  
they must include goals and priorities, not just a list of tasks.  
Volunteers versus Paid Staff  
Event organizations utilize volunteers to fill the jobs that might otherwise be  
staffed with temporary employees or laborers, but, as discussed earlier, it is often  
more effective to hire temporary staffing for certain menial task areas and use vol-  
unteer resources in other more meaningful \(personal or event-specific\) task areas.  
Rusin \(1999, 37-40\) says that people volunteer for many reasons, from personal  
interest to professional development.  
¢ They care—about the cause or the event.  
¢ They want to contribute—to make a difference and see results.  
¢ They are capable—they have a skill they wish to use.  
¢ They are curious—there is a skill that they are interested in developing.  
¢ They want challenge—seeking achievement unavailable elsewhere.  
¢ They are connected—their friends or family are volunteers.  
¢ They want connections—meeting new people and making new friends.  
¢ They are constituents—they have something to gain from the outcome.  
These factors often come down to what one might call enlightened self-interest,  
yet you must understand these motives and allocate or assign volunteers so that  
their needs and desires are met, providing a community atmosphere that supplies  
connection, participation, and camaraderie. Van der Wagen \(2007\) contends that  
expectation is a two-way street—both the event organization and the volunteer  
have selection criteria.

Janet Landey, CSEP, joint managing director of Party Design in Johannesburg,  
South Africa, and founding president of the South Africa chapters of ISES and  
IFEA, cautions event organizers to remember that not all volunteers are peo-  
ple of means with time on their hands—excellent volunteers can be found  
in any and every socioeconomic strata. “For many civic, political, sports, or  
cause-related events, many volunteers are enthusiasts or fans who want to

participate or support the event, yet they may not have the financial means  
to even pay for the bus to get to the event or cover the costs of refreshments  
while working on the event. If event organizers do not take this into consider-  
ation they may be losing a valuable work force and the event becomes exclu-  
sionary rather than inclusionary.’  
Landey notes that many people volunteer to get the practical experience  
that can lead to meaningful employment in a new field, or even employment  
in any field. “People learn valuable technical and life skills when working on  
an event that will translate to many different employment contexts, plus they  
gain an incredible sense of self esteem.’ She says involvement on the train-  
ing committees for major events such as the World Summit on Sustainable  
Development and World Cup Cricket allowed her to witness phenomenal

results. “You see the most amazing transformation. You would weep with joy.

Finding and Recruiting Volunteers  
Large, well-known events usually have no problem attracting volunteers; it’s the  
smaller events that usually need to be more aggressive in their recruitment efforts.  
As you look at the reasons people volunteer, you should be able to envision places  
where these people might be found\: the membership of an affinity group or pro-  
fessional association; donors to a charitable organization; schools, retirement  
communities, recreation centers, clubs, community service groups; online com-  
munities or interest groups; participant or stakeholder groups, sponsoring orga-  
nizations, business associates \(customers or suppliers\); and, of course, the friends  
and family of current volunteers. Considering that the population as a whole is  
aging but remaining active and in better health, you should also consider senior  
citizen centers because they provide a gathering place \(and often training\). Events  
that have specific constituencies such as members, participants, fans, or support-  
ers should begin with those constituencies, then identify the demographic profile  
of the groups and expand their target marketing outward concentrically from  
those demographics. Events without specific constituencies or first-time events  
will need to develop target market profiles based on the skill sets and task assignments  
to be filled.  
To recruit volunteers effectively, you must have a mechanism for joining the  
organization or volunteer ranks, usually a volunteer application or enrollment 380  
Vendors and Volunteers  
form \(similar to a job application form\) made available through a variety of por-  
tals and/or recruitment events. This application or enrollment form should be  
designed to collect information regarding thé applicant's skills, schedule availabil-  
ity, and interests and to communicate the types of positions and task assignments  
to be filled and the time commitment required for each \(developed from the job  
description\). Such forms should also ask prospective volunteers to indicate their  
first, second, and third choices of volunteer assignment. Many events include vol-  
unteer information, solicitations, and applications in their printed and electronic  
marketing materials. You might also consider conducting open volunteer recruit-  
ment events as a kickoff to your event marketing campaign, as well as during  
your volunteer thank-you event in anticipation of the next event \(inviting each  
volunteer to bring prospective volunteers as guests\).  
The way in which volunteers are treated will increase retention. Van der Wagen  
\(2007, 228, 67\) cited the primary reasons volunteers quit include “workload \[over-  
or under-utilization\], lack of appreciation, and poor event organization.” She advises  
event organizations develop a code of conduct for managing volunteers that includes  
such things as providing a “healthy and safe workplace” that accommodates their  
physical and psychological needs, and avoiding “placing volunteers in positions  
more suitable for paid staff” or “in situations that are difficult or dangerous.”

Gloria Nelson, CSEP, chief experience officer of Winneconne, Wisconsin-based  
Gloria Nelson Event Design, LLC, frequently offers volunteer opportunities  
to students in the hospitality industry. She says, “You can recruit volunteers  
from higher learning institutions offering certificate, associate, or bachelor’s  
programs within the realm of the hospitality management areas of study.  
Technical schools, colleges \(Community, state, and private\), and universities  
are wonderful resources for recruiting students.” Nelson suggests that sea-  
soned colleagues are also a great resource “particularly for assignments lean-  
ing more toward leadership/management roles on projects. Look to industry  
associations such as ISES, PCMA, and MPI, etc. Utilize all technology available,  
such as the event Web site, Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin, etc., for posting  
these volunteer opportunities.”  
Since volunteers, especially student volunteers, need a clear understand-  
ing of the job/task assignments, Nelson insists that “recruitment materials  
include all pertinent information regarding who, what, when, where, and  
why. Outline the scope of work and time commitment involved, including

381  
ge wr most vivo saat eee eadamn encanta mmedanemmaneeneemammeaaemammenaeee =e  
essential obligations such as any prereading or precon meetings. Examine  
the risks involved when using volunteers and make sure a legal waiver is exe-  
cuted by each volunteer stating that they are not an employee and have their  
own medical insurance. You may wish to retain legal counsel to create such a  
legal document for your event in order to minimize your risk exposure.” Once  
recruited, Nelson advises the following\:  
e Distribute job descriptions to each volunteer. Be very specific with tasks.  
For example, if all linens being installed on tables need to have a center  
seam run consistently in one direction, then spell it out on paper.  
e Create a page for your event binder with their emergency contact infor-  
mation as well as phone numbers.  
e Develop and distribute an emergency/risk protocol to each volunteer  
2 SOc tee ome ner oom oN Rtn toon  
prior to being on-site for review and signature.  
e Take care of the volunteers supporting your efforts. Provide a green  
room where they will have ample food and beverages, including water,  
throughout the event.  
e Send out a post-event evaluation to each volunteer. This offers critical  
feedback with communication, kudos, or challenges conveyed and most  
importantly, ask if they were made to feel as though they were a valuable  
member of the team. The latter is critical in recruitment for future events.  
e Consider creating a certificate of appreciation including name, event,  
date of event, and number of hours worked on the program. Students  
often have “field service” hours they must complete prior to gradua-  
tion. Seasoned professionals are also able to utilize such opportunities  
when pursuing certification or recertification credentials by including  
nonprofit volunteering documentation in their application or recertifi-  
cation submissions.  
The Key to Success Is Communication  
From the planning and sourcing phases to the soliciting and selecting phases, from  
the initial interview through the orientation and training program, from the job  
description to the performance evaluation—communication will be the key to suc-  
cess in dealing with your human resources—your human assets. You must be clear 382

about your expectations, clear about the responsibilities and remuneration, and  
clear about the purpose and outcomes necessary for a successful event and event  
organization. You must provide the mechanisms for open and interactive commu-  
nication between leaders and workers and throughout the entire framework of the  
workforce \(see Figure 13.3\). You must create an atmosphere of trust, teamwork, and  
respect, and one that communicates appreciation for a job well done.  
Events utilizing large numbers of volunteers or staff should consider setting  
up an online community with a dedicated Web site linked to the event’s Web  
site. Staff or volunteers can be instructed to check the Web site for important  
announcements regarding event plans and updates, and allows them to commu-  
nicate with one another electronically before, during, and after the event. This  
“members only” Web site, accessible only to team members via an identification  
number and/or password, can deal with pertinent issues and information about  
working on the event, and could include features such as\:

Workforce Employment Issues  
The employment of temporary or part-time staff must be approached from a tradi-  
tional human resource perspective, including hiring and firing practices, wage scales  
and benefits, and employment and workplace standards. All employment situations  
are subject to various federal, state or provincial, and/or municipal laws regarding  
personnel. In the United States these include, among other personnel laws\:  
¢ Age Discrimination in Employment Act \(ADEA\)  
e Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\)  
¢ Fair Labor Standards Act \(FLSA\)—minimum wage, overtime pay, record  
keeping, and child labor  
¢ Family and Medical Leave Act \(FMLA\)  
¢ Immigration Reform and Control Act  
\* Occupational Safety and Health Act \(OSHA\)—workplace safety regulations  
° Title VII of the Civil Rights Act—prohibiting discrimination because of  
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin  
¢ Workers’ compensation requirements  
You can acquire these paid human resources through commercial or govern-  
ment employment agencies, temporary or contract employee services, or union  
organizations. You might also find community service groups that will provide  
temporary work forces in return for a donation or fee. You should also consider  
your existing internal human resources, perhaps promoting or transferring exist-  
ing staff or employing individuals who have served as volunteers or interns with  
your organization. In addition, you might advertise in the employment or “help  
wanted” sections of local newspapers, on community bulletin boards, in organi-  
zational newsletters or publications, and through higher education or continuing  
education departments of academic institutions in the area.  
Personnel Management  
The professional event coordinator must understand the scope and techniques  
of human resource management, which is an ongoing and circular process, as  
illustrated in Figure 13.4. To effectively allocate and coordinate an event’s human  
assets, it is important to establish the guidelines for managing human resources, 384

outlining and defining policies and procedures, roles and responsibilities, com-  
munication mechanisms, and performance evaluation techniques. An event's per-  
sonnel should be utilized to its and their best advantage. They must be provided  
with the appropriate information and direction so they can perform the tasks  
required. There must be procedures that allow them to contribute their experi-  
ence, expertise, and insights to the success of the event, and ways to reward those  
contributions. You might be directly involved throughout the process or respon-  
sible for only certain aspects, but you must ensure that the people serving within  
the event organization are given the appropriate tools, training, motivation, and  
recognition.  
Recruitment and Selection  
Recruitment is actually the first component of a training program. Recruitment  
and Training Director Tom Norton \(1999\) states, “A good working relationship  
begins before the person is hired. Everything you say during the selection pro-  
cess 1s just as important and memorable as what you tell \[people\] when they are  
hired.” Your recruitment materials, presentations, and personnel should demon-  
strate the attitude, appearance, and actions expected of people working on your  
event or within your event organization. Personnel Management  
385  
You might advertise positions on an ongoing basis or hold large recruiting  
events at which you process dozens, hundreds, or thousands of applicants at once.  
Use application forms \(paper-based or form-field based on a Web site\) that collect  
the necessary and legally appropriate information, and screen those applications  
for areas of job interest and qualifications. Conduct interviews that allow the  
applicant to learn as much about your event organization as you learn about the  
applicant's personality and skills, using questions that are open-ended and legally  
allowed. You are looking for attitude and aptitude, people who exhibit enthusi-  
asm and flexibility; they are looking for opportunity, challenge, and growth. If  
necessary, include content experts \(e.g., technical production, customer service,  
or food and beverage directors\) when interviewing applicants for skill-specific  
jobs. Always thank the applicant for coming, and let him or her know when the  
selections will be made.  
Select your candidates by reviewing and rating applications, prioritizing and  
checking the references of the applicants you wish to consider. Make an offer to  
suitable candidates \(and negotiate an employment agreement for paid staffing  
positions\) and welcome them to the event organization. Be certain you notify  
unsuccessful applicants promptly, but without explanations that might open your  
organization to discrimination liability. A certain all-volunteer arts and crafts  
show event organization was involved in a lengthy and costly lawsuit when a  
potential exhibition judging panelist was told that she was not chosen because the  
jury selection committee didn’t like her own artwork.  
Bring a new employee or staff member onto the event team administratively,  
creating a personnel file or record for the individual. Make certain you have cur-  
rent contact information and that all the appropriate tax forms are completed.  
Volunteers should sign a volunteer liability waiver if they are not covered under  
your insurance policy, and confidentiality agreements if event information is sen-  
sitive. At certain televised hallmark events, volunteers and staff involved in the  
opening and closing ceremonies are required to sign a confidentiality form to  
ensure that the production design remains secret. Issue any credentials and equip-  
ment necessary, conduct orientation sessions, and provide training as appropriate  
for the scope and operations of the event.  
Orientation Sessions  
Orientation sessions can be conducted one-on-one, in small groups, or in large  
group settings. These sessions should introduce new staff members or volunteers  
to the culture of your event organization and to their coworkers and supervi-  
sors. You should discuss the mission and vision of the event, the organizational  
structure, and the scope of the work to be done, as well as the operational require-  
ments, administrative procedures, accreditation system, emergency procedures, 386 Vendors and Volunteers  
and opportunities for personal/professional development. Although much of this  
information is included in an employee manual or volunteer handbook, it should  
be reiterated verbally in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and interaction to reinforce  
its content as well as the team spirit.  
Many human resource experts recommend creating a program theme or slogan  
to serve as a framework for the orientation, training, and motivation of employees  
or volunteers. For example, Team 2002, the volunteer corps for the 2002 Olympic  
Games in Salt Lake City, used the acronym CHARGE! \(Committed, Helpful,  
Adaptable, Respectful, Gracious, Enjoy!\) for its program. Organizers used these  
six words to introduce and expand on important training concepts and event  
systems throughout their multilevel training program and training materials.  
Each word served as an umbrella for the important lessons and instructions they  
needed their volunteers to remember and practice while working at the Games.  
Instruction Manuals and Handbooks  
Instruction manuals and handbooks are efficient means of providing your employ-  
ees and volunteers with the information and regulations that will govern their  
employment or involvement with your event organization. Depending on the size  
and complexity of your organization and the paid or volunteer status of the indi-  
vidual worker, you might have a simple instruction sheet or a volume of policies,  
procedures, and practices. For contracted temporary employees, you should con-  
firm that your policies are compatible with the contracting agency’s employment  
policies. You might wish to, or need to, create different manuals for employees and  
volunteers \(see Figure 13.5\), but both should contain the practical instructions  
and relevant policies or legislated compliance requirements that your employees and  
volunteers might use and reference to ensure a positive working relationship with  
your event organization. Always consult with your legal counsel about all applicable  
employment laws and regulations and the written policies in an employee manual;  
do not use language in your employee manual that promises or could be construed  
to promise employees a job as long as they follow your rules.  
Training Programs  
‘Training programs provide the tools necessary to prepare your human resources to  
deliver a consistent level of service \(because services cannot be separated from the  
person providing them\) and to be successful contributors to the success of the event.  
For training to be effective, the event organization, as well as the trainee, needs to  
recognize its benefits and commit sufficient resources to the training program.  
These benefits include improved customer/guest service, increased productivity  
and skill levels, reduced absenteeism and stress, opportunities for advancement,  
enthusiasm, event ownership, enjoyment, and a greater commitment to teamwork. Personnel Management

\(Continued\)  
You will likely be providing overall event training as well as job-specific training.  
You might be training individuals one-on-one on the job or in large groups prior to  
the event. Some event organizations combine the orientation session with a train-  
ing session, and others hold progressive training sessions over a period of time; it  
all depends on the scope and complexity of the training required. Van der Wagen  
\(2007, 147\) categorizes workforce training into three parts—orientation \(general  
introduction to the event\), venue \(familiarization with the event site and work  
areas\), and job-specific \(skills, specific tasks, and expectations\)—and suggests that  
workers are most interested in personally relevant information \(i.e., job-specific\). Personnel Management  
389  
You must determine the training subjects required, the measurable objectives  
for training and evaluation measurements, and the time, place, trainers, and  
method of delivery for the training program. Training must employ multiple  
communication mechanisms that permit trainees to internalize and understand  
the information and instructions given; they need to know what, how, and why,  
and they need to see, hear, and do. Personnel must be given an opportunity to  
practice procedures at a pace appropriate for them, and these should be practiced  
in an environment similar to the event conditions in which they will be perform-  
ing. You should always encourage your staff and volunteers to ask for additional  
guidance and training as needed.  
Scheduling and Assignments  
Paid and volunteer staff must be scheduled so that all tasks are accomplished in  
a timely manner and all functional areas are sufficiently staffed. It is important  
to assign people to jobs that will satisfy their motives and interests \(and that let  
them use the brains you hired them for\), rather than ask volunteers to do some-  
thing you wouldn't be willing to do. Never leave individuals without the tools or  
resources to accomplish their duties, and make certain that they are not stranded  
at their posts if their replacements do not show up. It is a good idea to have volunteers  
check in and check out to ensure that they have completed their shifts.  
You must promote teamwork and encourage cooperation and mutual support  
within your entire workforce. Buchholz and Roth \(1987, 15\) identify the phases  
of team development\: \(1\) the collection of individuals for the work group, \(2\) the  
development of a group identity, defining their roles, directed by a leader, and  
\(3\) the development of a purpose-centered team with shared responsibilities. You  
want to create an atmosphere of teamwork, but you must be careful that func-  
tional divisions or teams do not become fiefdoms. It is important to eliminate  
the distinction between paid and volunteer positions in terms of their value or  
importance—they are both critical to the success of the event—and you should  
recognize both team and individual achievements.  
Motivation, Recognition, and Retention  
Motivation is an inner state that causes a person to act in a way that ensures sat-  
isfaction through accomplishment. There are four people principles of motivation\:  
1  
. All people are motivated.  
2  
. People motivate themselves.  
3.  
People do things for their reasons, not yours.  
4. People want and need recognition. 390 Vendors and Volunteers  
Establish a motivational environment using rewards and incentives, both  
tangible and intangible. Psychologist Frederick I. Herzberg \(1966\) challenged  
assumptions that people are motivated solely by money and other tangible ben-  
efits. His research showed that employees need to feel that they are achieving  
something, that they are responsible for their work, and they are allowed to work  
with minimal supervision.  
Develop recognition systems that link performance directly to rewards.  
Tangible rewards and incentives should be something of value to the recipient  
and might need to be held in reserve until the task or assignment has been com-  
pleted. Recognition \(intangible rewards\) should be given publicly and whenever  
appropriate, preferably directly following an achievement to provide positive rein-  
forcement. You might institute such recognition systems as a Wall of Fame with  
photos of top performers, Event Bucks \(coupons given out by supervisors that  
may be exchanged for prizes or paid time off\), or impromptu standing ovations.  
An event organization is an eco-system, one that needs to be balanced, stable,  
and sustainable. Retaining experienced people is vital to this system. “Retention  
is an outcome, not a task” \(Energize, Inc. 2010\). Retaining good volunteers and  
paid staff depends on meeting their needs and giving them the proper recogni-  
tion. Meaningful and satisfying work, authentic engagement, and providing a  
supportive environment will enhance your ability to find and keep these people  
in whom you have invested time and training, and who have, in return, invested  
their time and talents in the success of your event.  
Monitoring and Evaluating  
# Performance  
Performance monitoring and assessment are important components of any human  
resource management process. The process begins with clearly stated job descrip-  
tions and objectives, followed by appropriate orientation and training, continues  
with control through monitoring checkpoints and effective feedback systems,  
and, finally, is refined by conducting performance evaluations that promote the  
growth and development of the individual as well as the improvement and success  
of the event organization. People want to do a good job. They want to succeed.  
They want to know how well they are doing and how they can do things better.  
The professional event coordinator must implement a systematic approach that  
fosters two-way communication and a commitment to improvement.  
Checkpoints and Coaching  
You should incorporate monitoring checkpoints into the event timeline and oper-  
ations plan that ensure that staff and volunteers have sufficient tools and training Monitoring and Evaluating Performance 391  
to complete their assignments successfully. Heller \(1999, 29\) advises, “Check  
regularly and informally on progress of delegated tasks. It is important to talk to  
people regularly about their jobs and how you and they think performance could  
be improved.” Wiersma and Strolberg \(2001, 98\) suggest zone management with  
zone leaders for events to make certain volunteers feel that they have someone to  
ask questions of and that there is someone to check on them.  
Institute feedback systems that allow workers to seek guidance and addi-  
tional training as well as contribute suggestions. Heller \(1998, 64\) contends  
that feedback is essential to communication. “How feedback is transmitted,  
and what happens in response to it, is basic to effective communication.” Ask  
your workers if they have any questions or concerns and where they are expe-  
riencing challenges; their answers can help you identify areas in which your  
training needs improvement. Then coach and conduct rather than control your  
workers. Refocus and redirect their efforts as needed. Keep in mind the Jaw of  
buoyancy—let go and they will rise.  
Evaluation Criteria  
In order to conduct effective performance reviews, you must establish appropriate  
evaluation criteria \(see Figure 13.6\). Harbour \(1997, 19\) notes that performance  
measures \(for both personnel and procurement\) are used for the following\:  
¢ To establish a baseline measurement  
e To measure performance level changes over time \(trending\)  
¢ To ensure that performance is staying within tolerance limits \(controlling\)  
¢ To determine problem areas \(diagnostic\)  
To predict future performance \(planning\)  
Performance should be measured against the job requirements and the quali-  
ties important to the event operations, such as customer service abilities or  
compliance with safety procedures. As with criteria for evaluating vendor pro-  
posals, more weight can be assigned to certain criteria than to others, but it is  
important to consider a broad scope of criteria encompassing knowledge, skills,  
and attitude.

Evaluation Criteria 392 Vendors and Volunteers  
Performance Reviews  
Performance reviews should be conducted one on one with employees in a sched-  
uled and logically consistent cycle of frequency, such as at the conclusion of an  
introductory or probationary period, annually, biannually, seasonally, or at an event-  
specific point in time. Let people know what they will be evaluated on and why.  
Performance reviews could be linked with advancement or salary/wage increases,  
but they should also be structured to encourage achievement. Performance reviews  
or appraisals are conducted to allow both you and the individual you are evaluat-  
ing to determine areas in which improvement should be made and those in which  
additional training is required \(including the type of training and whether it will be  
provided by the organization or the responsibility of the individual\).  
Performance assessments should be a mutual \(between employee and evaluator\)  
identification and review of the individual’s strengths and weaknesses and should  
be approached as a constructive critique rather than criticism \(errors are rarely due  
to malice\). In conducting the evaluation, you should seek input, feedback, and  
discussion regarding the job requirements and challenges. You should establish  
agreed-upon plans for improvement within a specified period of time and create  
opportunities for people to set their own goals. A staff performance review should  
always be documented in writing, with the employee given an opportunity to  
review the comments and add his or her own comments, then signed by both  
evaluator and employee. The performance of individual volunteers should be  
reviewed and evaluated internally by staff and supervisors, perhaps using the same  
criteria used for employees, with recommendations as to appropriateness for  
further involvement recorded for future reference.  
Data Mining through Evaluations  
Just as an event’s external customers \(the audience\) are asked to evaluate an event,  
which is discussed further in Chapter 14, its internal customers \(volunteers, staff,  
suppliers, and other stakeholders\) must be asked for their reviews of the event  
and its operations. Volunteers should be asked to evaluate their involvement in  
the event, including such areas as satisfaction with their assignments, the training  
received, the workload, and the value of the rewards or incentives. You should  
also seek feedback on any areas of concern, recommendations for improvement,  
and interest in repeat involvement. These evaluations, which should be sched-  
uled directly following an event, might include surveys, one-on-one interviews,  
or group discussions. The 80-20 rule \(80 percent of your sales comes from 20 per-  
cent of your customers\) applies to cause and effect as well—80 percent of effects  
usually come from 20 percent of the possible causes. Therefore, it is imperative to  
mine your evaluations for data that will reveal those causes that have significant  
positive and negative effects on your event operations and human resources. Conflict Resolution, Discipline, and Termination  
393  
Conflict Resolution, Discipline,  
and Termination  
In dealing with human beings, conflict is inevitable. In requiring human beings  
to perform in specific ways, disciplinary measures are often required. In managing  
human resources, termination might be necessary. Not all conflict is bad—it is  
often simply a difference of opinion, which might be the catalyst for innovative  
solutions as “assumptions are confronted, decisions questioned, and better choices  
often result” \(Horowitz 1999, 80\). Disciplinary measures should be designed as  
corrective actions with specific consequences rather than purely punitive mea-  
sures. And, when necessary to terminate or separate an employee from the event  
organization, such actions must protect the dignity of the person being dismissed.  
Prevention  
Conflict and unacceptable behavior most often result from unclear instructions  
and ill-defined expectations. Preventing problems is better than fixing them.  
Creating an atmosphere of open and effective communication will allow you to  
prevent many disputes as well as avoid the destructive aspects of conflict. Blocks  
to effective communication include the timing \(e.g., too early, too late, insuf-  
ficient repetition\), the method \(verbal messages must be reinforced with written  
messages and vice versa\), the environment \(e.g., too noisy, too busy, interruptions,  
etc.\), and emotions \(e.g., hurt feelings, personality conflicts, wishful listening—  
hearing only what you want to hear\). You must establish your expectations in writing  
in vendor contract language, job descriptions, and instructions, and in published  
policies and procedures, based on experience, fairness, and regulatory requirements.  
Many event organizations create a formal grievance procedure that permits staff  
and volunteers to register complaints through a systematic hierarchy that ensures  
that grievances will be heard, investigated, and responded to.  
Conflict Resolution Strategies  
Conflict resolution expert Dudley Weeks, PhD \(1992, 61\) states, “Conflict is an  
outgrowth of diversity and differences. Conflicts are not always limited to battles  
between interests and desires. Needs, perceptions, power, values and principles, feel-  
ings and emotions, and internal conflicts are critical ingredients of our relationships  
and the conflicts that punctuate relationships.” He advises that rather than trying  
to find a quick fix or pretending the conflict doesn’t exist \(typical but ineffective  
approaches to conflict resolution\), one must clarify each individual’s perceptions,  
build shared positive power, and develop action steps that are mutually benefi-  
cial. Hunsaker and Alessandra \(1986, 230\) contend that you must look for root 394 Vendors and Volunteers  
problems so that you can ultimately resolve the causes of the conflict rather than  
simply the symptoms. Conflict resolution techniques include the following\:  
\* Stop, look, and listen—Think before you act; identify the nature of the  
conflict; do not discount the importance of the conflict to the individual\(s\);  
recognize the emotional and functional needs of the conflicting parties—  
people need to be heard.  
\* Separate from the situation—Postpone discussion to a different time \(cooling-  
off period\) or place \(neutral territory\); handle the situation in private; refer  
to the applicable policies, procedures, and provisions of contractual, collective,  
or waiver agreements.  
\* Beunderstanding but objective —Remain calm; do not “take sides’; empathize  
but stay focused on the goals and objectives of the event.  
\* Be reasonable and respectful—Focus on behavior rather than personality;  
point to solutions instead of pointing fingers; do not shame; allow people to  
retain/regain their composure and integrity.  
\* Seek solutions—Solicit and suggest possibilities; prepare to compromise or  
to relocate an individual; seek agreement on the change and its timeline.  
\* Follow up—Refer to the appropriate entity \(e.g.,  
grievance committee or  
management\); record the details and document discussions; follow up on  
the agreed-upon solutions.  
Disciplinary Measures  
The professional event coordinator must, first and foremost, make certain that  
staff members are aware of and understand all rules, regulations, policies, proce-  
dures, and expectations, and must use positive reinforcement and behavior model-  
ing \(displaying the desired behavior\) to sculpt desired behavior. If incidents and  
infractions occur, they should be reported to the proper management authorities  
and progressive disciplinary measures employed as necessary to correct behavior  
rather than as punishment. Progressive discipline involves successive warnings with  
attendant consequences, coupled with corrective training and agreed-to levels of  
improvement. Any incidents or infractions, as well as the disciplinary measures  
employed, should be recorded in the employee's personnel record or file.  
You might wish to establish a table of offenses and penalties that will make  
perfectly clear the consequences of certain actions. This listing can include the  
offense \(e.g., unauthorized absence from the job\) and the penalties for the first,  
second, and subsequent offenses. The penalties could include oral admonish-  
ments, written reprimands or warnings, suspensions \(e.g., 5 to 30 days with or  
without pay\), and removal/termination. You might also need to establish which  
infractions or conduct will result in automatic removal/summary dismissal \(e.g.,  
violence, possession of weapons, theft, sexual harassment, alcohol/drug abuse,  
misuse of company property, information tampering, etc.\). Wrap Up

Termination Procedures  
No one wants to fail, and no one wants the event to be a failure—including  
the employees of the event organization. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to  
remove an individual from the event organization because of unacceptable perfor-  
mance levels or behavior. When termination is necessary, Horowitz \(1999, 307\)  
advises, “You can't hide from your responsibilities, but you can help create an  
atmosphere that makes the process as minimally stressful and as little humiliating  
as possible.” The professional event coordinator charged with firing an employee  
\(or volunteer\) must implement a sensitive yet succinct procedure, preferably one  
that has been established within a written policy\:  
\* Doit in private—Safeguard the person’s self-esteem.  
\* Be straightforward— Tell the person exactly why he or she is being fired, but  
conveyed in general terms, preferably with reasons in writing. \(Be prepared  
to support these reasons with documentation.\)  
\* Listen but do not argue—Allow the person to talk, but let him or her know  
the decision is final.  
\* Be clear about immediate expectations—Explain what the person needs to  
do next to complete the discharge \(e.g., clean out desk now, return property,  
do not return, etc.\).  
\* Be discreet— Tell only those people who need to know and tell them only  
what they need to know.  
Throughout the process of planning, sourcing, soliciting, selecting, and evalu-  
ating the vendors and human resources that will come together to create, operate,  
and deliver the event, the professional event coordinator must remember that it  
is the people who make an event a success. Each person is an individual, with  
individual needs and expectations as well as talents and limitations. Each person  
deserves respect and recognition for his or her contribution to the success of the  
event. Each person is a distinct and distinctive part of the event team. No one  
should be anonymous.  
Wrap Up  
The professional event coordinator must work with a broad variety of people to  
bring an event to life, including vendors, volunteers, participants, and temporary,  
part-time, and full-time personnel, all coming together as a team. Finding and  
securing the right people and providers is dependent on a systematic and equitable  
approach that matches the needs of the event with the needs of the individuals.  
Procurement policies and processes should be employed to identify the goods and  
services to be outsourced and the sources best qualified to provide them, then the 396 Vendors and Volunteers  
best products and services should be secured at the best prices, based on the criteria  
most important to the achievement of the goals and objectives of the event.  
Recruiting and acquiring volunteers and support staff should be approached in  
the same systematic manner, including planning, sourcing, soliciting, selecting,  
and evaluating performance. Identifying tasks and skill set requirements forms  
the basis for job descriptions, and establishing reasonable policies and procedures  
forms the basis for employee manuals or volunteer handbooks, both of which  
serve as important communication tools to assist personnel in becoming effective  
members of the event team.  
The professional event coordinator must implement a comprehensive and pro-  
gressive approach to human resource management that ensures that the personnel  
serving the event organization have the appropriate tools, training, motivation,  
and recognition. Recruitment events, orientation sessions, and training programs  
are all opportunities to establish and reinforce the culture of the event organiza-  
tion, which might be more effective when incorporated within the framework of  
a program theme promoting teamwork and commitment.  
Monitoring and performance evaluation activities provide the feedback mecha-  
nisms to promote the growth and development of the individual and the improve-  
ment of the event organization’s programs and processes. They must be planned  
carefully to ensure that checkpoints and coaching opportunities are timely and  
constructive. Effective communications will form the basis for these activities, as  
well as any conflict resolution, disciplinary measures, or termination procedures that  
become necessary. The professional event coordinator must create an environment of  
respect and recognition for the important human assets that bring the event to life.

In this chapter you will learn how to\:  
Develop and implement efficient record keeping systems and data  
processing procedures, utilizing technology for the acquisition,  
storage, retrieval, and security of information.  
Create comprehensive production books to facilitate on-site  
operations and communications.  
Conduct effective evaluation activities to gain valuable information  
and analysis to direct future event operations and marketing efforts.  
Prepare reports that facilitate the timely and efficient distribution of  
information to event stakeholders.  
Collect and archive the documentation, documents, records, physical  
evidence, and historical information that provide examples, proof, or  
support of actions and activities important to the future success of an  
event or event organization.

a huge party that had ended just an hour ago. The party had been the culmina-  
tion of a multiday convention involving dozens of large events for a group of 5,000 del-  
egates. Everyone had been working at peak performance levels for more than a month  
and just wanted to sleep for a week. In an apologetic but cautionary tone, the event  
coordinator advised her team, “No job is over until the paperwork is done’

Paperwork \(physical or digital\), and the information included therein, is  
a crucial component of professional event coordination. As a professional event  
coordinator, you will plan, organize, allocate, direct, and control resources to  
achieve goals and objectives; in these efforts, information is an incredibly valuable  
resource. Information does not automatically equate to knowledge; you need to  
understand the information in order for it to be useful. You will amass tremen-  
dous amounts of information throughout the event coordination process, and  
without organizing and handling that information appropriately, you will not be  
able to utilize that profusion of data to achieve the goals and objectives of your  
event and event organization.  
The management of information is vital to acquiring the knowledge you require  
to coordinate the events for which you are responsible. You cannot expect to keep  
all this information in your head, and unless it is on paper or electronically stored,  
you cannot transfer your knowledge effectively to others on your event team or  
in your event organization. Sound administrative procedures for bookkeeping,  
correspondence, database maintenance, and other record keeping and reporting  
activities must be integrated throughout your event operations.  
Information Management  
Throughout the event coordination process you will generate, receive, collect,  
seek out, send out, sort, analyze, and store a broad range of information. This  
information directs the production of your event, from the research and design  
stage, through planning and implementation, and, finally, to evaluation of the  
event. To effectively manage information and implement efficient record keep-  
ing, you must understand what types of information you have, what types of Information Management  
401  
information you need, and what information you must keep and why, and then  
develop systems and procedures for handling and keeping it.  
There are three things done with all this information—assessing, organizing,  
and controlling. Your assessment will include an inventory and review of all the  
documents and paperwork pertaining to your event operations to identify paper-  
work repetition or redundancy and gaps in the types of documents needed to  
efficiently and effectively conduct the business of your event. You then conduct a  
functional analysis to determine how these documents support your event opera-  
tions. In addition, you will want to ensure that your documents—from corre-  
spondence to reports, checklists to memorandums—are designed in such a way  
that they are easy to comprehend, are economic and effective in style, and project  
the image and identity of your organization.  
Organizing your documents and information will include establishing  
filing systems, storage methods and materials, plus tracing and tracking sys-  
tems for efficient retrieval. Many of these functions are best accomplished  
utilizing standard or specialized computer software programs or Web-based  
systems. Controlling information involves establishing standard operating  
procedures to deal with communications, record keeping, documentation,  
reference and archive materials, and security issues. You need a “paper trail”  
of everything connected with the event—get everything in writing, and keep  
it where you can get at it.  
Analyze Your Information System  
Information and document identification and analysis are critical to the success  
of your information management strategy. Look at all the items listed in Figure 14.1  
\(which is by no means complete\) and consider the fact that many of these types  
of documents and information come in a variety of forms and serve numerous  
functions. Some apply to a specific event, others to your event organization or  
business. You must develop an understanding of how and why each piece of infor-  
mation and documentation affects and supports your event coordination processes  
and procedures.  
To assess your information resources, assemble and review the documents you  
use within your event operations and identify the documents that are generated  
internally, such as memos and proposals, and those that are generated externally,  
such as permits and regulatory forms. Conduct a gap analysis \(reviewing your  
procedures to identify any missing components or functions\) to determine what  
internally generated information or documents are nonexistent or inadequate for  
your operational requirements. Consider the effort that will be required to gather  
together all these documents. Next, review all internal documents for style and  
content. Your documents should reflect your image and branding objectives as  
well as serve their functional purpose. Do they say what you need them to say in 402

clear and compelling language? Are they economical,  
simple in style? Are your  
forms and checklists comprehensive and easy to use?  
Carefully analyze the function or functions of each document and each type  
of information required for your event operations. Analyze how and why you use  
each in your day-to-day operations. How does each document impact your ability  
to research, design, plan, implement, and evaluate your events and event orga-  
nization? This analysis will help you develop standardized communications and  
documentation and to determine the best strategies for organizing and controlling  
paperwork and information. Information Management  
403  
Design Documents for Efficiency and Clarity  
Well-designed documents will improve your efficiency and effectiveness and rein-  
force your image-branding objectives. You must understand who will be using or  
reading a document, the purpose of the document, and the action required of the  
recipient. Review your event coordination processes, start to finish and threshold  
to threshold, to formulate your standard correspondence, memorandums, proposals,  
reports, and the like. Establish a format and style that includes an effective layout  
of information, graphics, key branding images, and language style \(see Figure 14.2\).  
Remember that image influences perceptions.  
Once you have your standard formats defined and refined, use them consistently.  
Create templates in your word processor for your frequently used documents and rou-  
tine correspondence, including proposals, time lines, budgets, contracts, job orders, and  
others. Develop document naming conventions that indicate purpose, version,  
and preparer. Design your documents to be integrated into your information man-  
agement systems, collecting the information you require in a format that will function  
within your procedures, so that you can reduce the number of times you must collect or  
record information such as names, contact information, dates, and other data. Design  
checklists and forms that will facilitate your information-gathering requirements and  
reduce repetition of effort, including site inspection checklists, client or employee inter-  
view forms, evaluation instruments, and numerous other documents. These must be  
easy to use and must be used consistently to be effective. Understand what information  
you are gathering, why it is required, and how it will be used.

Robert Sivek, CSEP, CERP, and Deborah Borsum, CSEP, CERP, CMD, owners of  
The Meetinghouse Companies, Inc., in Elmhurst, Illinois, have what they call  
“the Rainbow Book”—a series of standard operating forms that are printed  
on pages of different colors, called “Rainbow Sheets,’ for different types of  
jobs and job duties. Sivek notes, “We have a form for everything from check-  
lists to worksheets. These help our event producers make sure they ask all the  
continues

INSIGHT 404 Knowledge Management  
right questions, and it reduces the ‘Oh, | forgot!’ These forms provide the checks  
and balances throughout our administrative and event production operations.’  
Borsum says that those checks and balances are critical to the organization's mar-  
keting objectives as well as its management operations. “Since Robert and | own  
the company, every event our company produces is a reflection on us because  
our name is on it. We use the Rainbow Sheets as a quality assurance instrument”

Organize and Control Information  
Once you have assessed and analyzed the documents and documentation that will  
be required for your event coordination operations and responsibilities, you must  
organize the information in those documents in a manner that suits your proce-  
dures and your work style. Organization is a very personal matter; no one system  
or strategy will serve the specific needs of all the varied types of events and event  
organizations. Understand how you do what you do, then develop the systems  
and procedures for organizing the information and documentation required for  
your operations. Design these systems to facilitate your needs, while ensuring that  
these systems are functional for other individuals in your event operation as well.  
The best filing system, storage device, or document designs will not be effective  
unless procedures and protocols for their use are established and enforced. Whether  
you are a one-person operation or part of an event organization employing hundreds  
of people, you must develop mechanisms for controlling the information you have.  
Gerber \(1995, 100\) contends that you should become “systems-dependent,” not  
“people-dependent,” so that your information management strategy remains efficient  
and effective regardless of who is involved in the process. He also suggests that systems  
should be designed to be operated by people with the lowest possible level of skill  
applicable to your organization. Your system design should also anticipate the depar-  
ture of personnel, ensuring that important information does not exit or disappear  
into the void when someone leaves the organization. For functions such as acquisition  
of information, communications, archival operations and the like, set up procedures  
that outline the actions to be taken with each type of information included in your  
event coordination process, based on the required flow of information, incoming and  
outgoing, as well as your legal, ethical, and fiduciary responsibilities.  
Tracing, Tracking, and Retrieving Information  
The reason information is such a valuable resource within professional event coor-  
dination is that it rarely applies to only a single event. Therefore, you must be able Information Management  
405  
to quickly locate information that will be useful to you and critical to the success of  
your event and event organization. You might be preparing numerous versions of a  
proposal until the final negotiation has taken place; you need to know which version  
is which. You might be managing numerous event projects simultaneously, handling  
numerous contracts that must be tracked for timely execution, or monitoring numer-  
ous committees and departments whose reports and meeting notes must be collected,  
reviewed, distributed, and acted on to make them worthwhile. For each type of infor-  
mation, a system must be established for efficient tracing, tracking, and retrieval.  
Filing systems are typically organized alphabetically, numerically, or chronologically,  
but can also be organized geographically, categorically, or according to a color coding  
system applicable to your operations. Consider your legal obligations regarding  
information in your files; tax requirements might dictate chronological records by  
tax period. You should cross-reference your filing systems to increase their function-  
ality. Organize the files in your computer the same way you would in a filing cabi-  
net. You can store vast amounts of information and files within your computer,  
making it available at your fingertips, but it is critical to remember to back up  
your files on a systematic and regular basis.  
Protect Your Information  
Filing and storage systems, physical or digital, should facilitate easy retrieval, yet you  
might need to control access to them. Information is not only power; it has fiscal,  
logistical, and competitive value, and you might have specific ethical and legal  
responsibility to protect certain types of information. As event coordinator, you  
must consider the safety and security of information materials. Important docu-  
ments and records, particularly confidential records, should be stored in filing  
cabinets with locking mechanisms, and you should use passwords for computer  
access and change those passwords periodically. What would happen if there was a  
fire or flood? You might need to invest in fireproof cabinets and consider a storage  
location other than your business premises where you keep critical original docu-  
ments or backup copies. After a specific time period, depending on your financial  
and legal requirements, almost all records should be put in storage or disposed of.  
Carefully consider the confidentiality and proprietary nature of information and  
establish the appropriate precautions and protection devices.  
Utilize Information Technology  
Forvirtuallyall information management functions, there are computer software pro-  
grams to help you \(see Figure 14.3 and review Figure 2.6, Corbin Ball’s Technology  
Categories, in Chapter 2\). Many of these are completely integrated, allowing you  
to consolidate information in a single system and transfer information from one  
application to another with a click ora keystroke. For example, Robert Sivek, CSEP,  
CERP, notes that his company’s rental inventory control software interfaces directly 406

with its accounting software, which streamlines financial operations, from pricing  
and bid preparation to billing and forecasting cash flow. In everything from inventory  
tracking, to human resources management, to working with client lists, vendor lists,  
and venue lists, using your computer to its fullest potential will increase your efficiency.  
Word-processing software allows you to create document templates to quickly  
generate reports, contracts, and production orders. Database software allows you  
to manage lists of information, ranging from inventory to contact lists. Spreadsheet  
software allows you to manipulate numbers and automatically calculate percentage  
markups for your bids, as well as grouping information into table formats, which  
provides the function of automatically changing all tables, no matter where they  
are, when you change something in the original table in the spreadsheet func-  
tion. Accounting software allows you to categorize and tabulate your revenues and  
expenditures, automatically calculate payroll taxes, and write checks.  
Registration-specific software provides integrated registration, housing, and report-  
ing operations; multipurpose meeting management software programs or suites often  
include relational databases that automatically record or change one piece of informa-  
tion \(e.g., telephone number or address\) marked as a sort field throughout the sys-  
tem on all documents or records using that sort field. Content management software  
allows you to solicit, select, and arrange topics and speakers for large conventions.  
Scheduling and project \(or event\) management software helps you plot out your  
plans and planning timelines, with automatic reminders or deadline triggers included to  
ensure that contracts, orders, and invoices are managed in a timely manner. Computer-  
aided design \(CAD\) floor plan diagramming software automatically calculates space  
and plots in tables, chairs, stages, and so forth, but you could do this manually in a  
simple graphics-based program. Desktop-publishing software assists you in designing  
and developing attractive newsletters, brochures, and other internal and external mar-  
keting pieces, as well as employee or volunteer handbooks, a variety of checklists, order  
forms, and questionnaires that reflect your corporate culture and image.  
You must remember, however, that software isa tool, nota panacea, and it requires  
a significant investment of human capital in addition to the financial capital needed  
to purchase the software. Newman \(2002\) advises that you must “allow time for  
learning the system, gathering your operation’s resource and service information, Information Management  
entering the data into the new system, understanding how the information you  
entered interacts with each area of the software, developing and conducting staff  
training, and being available for continued staff support.” That data entry and  
staff training can become expensive, but might be worth the cost in the long  
run—you must evaluate the software products available and their potential return  
in terms of efficiency and productivity.  
Although specialized software is available for many event coordination tasks such  
as budgeting, registration, room diagramming, scheduling, and so on \(plus many  
more applications sure to be developed\), the purchase of off-the-shelf software might  
be a cost-effective approach. Considering the relatively small price of bundled  
packages such as, for example, those Microsoft offers \(MS Word, Access, Excel,  
Outlook, and PowerPoint\), as compared with that of an integrated management  
suite or customized program developed specifically for your operations, as well as  
their overwhelming popularity and usage, adapting off-the-shelf software to your  
particular needs is likely faster, easier, and more cost-efficient.  
Dr. James P. Hogg of the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at the  
University of Central Florida is an expert in technology pertinent to the hospi-  
tality industry. When asked about purchasing software solutions, he stressed  
the importance of considering usability versus scalability when making soft-  
ware decisions in relationship to your budget into account. “You might have  
to use a solution today that will not fit your needs \(scalability\) in five years  
but it is what your budget will allow for purchase. You must think strategic  
information systems analysis when looking at software usability, functionality,  
scalability, and long-term budgeting. When we open source out the plat-  
forms or have the ability to migrate data sets from one application to another  
it allows programmers in the organizations \(or consultants\) to tailor the appli-  
cation to our organizational needs, future growth, and future software and  
hardware that will use the data fields for organizational effectiveness and cus-  
tomer service.” Dr. Hogg suggests that when looking at purchasing software  
solutions, you should include the following considerations\:  
e Will it communicate and integrate into future platforms or devices  
used by your organization and clients? “Most software applications don't  
integrate seamlessly; you need to have the ability to export data sets out  
of one application and import that data set into another application.’

e is the data encrypted based on personal information, financial data,  
and other sensitive information? -  
e How many machines or devices are authorized to run the software?  
e |s there a service contract in the purchase price, and how long is the  
software serviceable?  
e How many upgrades \(versions\) do | get for free with the purchase price  
before there are additional costs?  
e What platforms will the software run on \(e.g., PC, Unix, Mac, WebOs, etc.\)?  
“There are compatibility issues, support issues, and organizational issues.  
Many companies might use both or run a Unix system. The costs and license  
agreements will vary depending on platform and the amount of users.”  
e |s the software application proprietary to my organization or the soft-  
ware company?  
You may also wish to investigate Web-based products \(actually services\) that  
offer an “always on/access anywhere” platform, which may be rented, based on  
actual use, rather than purchasing a software package. Known as cloud computing  
\(services and storage provided over the Internet\), SaaS \(Software-as-a-service\) and  
PaaS \(Platforms-as-a-service\) might be used for free or at limited costs. “Most indi-  
viduals and some organizations are migrating to cloud computing and the use of  
handheld mobile communication devices such as WebOs, iPods, Smartphones, or  
iPads \(otherwise known as'‘thin clients’\). Most issues with the use of clouds and Web  
2.0 technologies deal with security of the individual, organization, and the data.”  
Cloud computing has also become popular for collaborative planning prod-  
ucts such as whiteboards and wikis. Dr. Hogg notes that there are security issues  
that must be addressed by encrypting data, secured log-ins, and where data are  
stored. Hogg suggests asking these questions\: How long are data stored, and who  
owns the information? If the data are encrypted, who has access to the data? Do  
they have access to all data or only certain data fields? Does an end user see this  
information, or is it communicated between systems for processing? Can data be  
gathered when systems communicate? How is data encrypted and decrypted?  
When using online payment systems, Dr. Hogg advises, “You need an SSL  
\(secure sockets layer\) certificate, and it should be handled by the online host-  
ing company or the credit card processing system used by your organization.  
Be careful when you use third-party providers, and never use third-party pro-  
viders without a signed legal contract specific to the handling of confidential  
information and security of financial information. Contracts need to be initi-  
ated and be on file with the legal department.” The Production Book  
409  
The Production Book  
The production book, also known as the operations manual or specifications guide-  
book, is your on-site reference and guidebook covering every important facet of an  
entire event. It should include anything and everything required for smooth opera-  
tions at the event site, even if you are not able to be there. \(Remember the Big Truck  
theory—if you get run over by a big truck, someone else should be able to take over  
and run the event.\) All key information and documents related to the planning and  
operations of the event, as well as any documentation required to comply with gov-  
ernment regulations, should be included in the production book \(see Figure 14.4\).  
The contents of the production book should include schedule, directory, and veri-  
fication documents and documentation important to the event coordination process.  
Many professional event coordinators use three-ring binders for their production  
books. This book will become your event bible, a compendium of the documenta-  
tion pertaining to your event operations. Information included in the production  
book must be cross-referenced several ways in order for it to be an effective tool.  
Organize the production book as best suits your needs, and clearly tab each section  
so you can quickly locate specific sequential or categorical information. Distribute  
copies of the book \(or customized versions\) to the key personnel on the event team.  
# Schedule  
The production book should include a complete schedule of all event components  
and activities. This schedule should be in at least two formats—chronological in  
sequence and alphabetical by activity \(e.g., President’s Lunch, Resource Room,  
Winery Tour\) or component \(e.g., audiovisual, catering, décor, entertainment\)  
or both, depending on the scope and complexity of the event. The chronological  
schedule will help you monitor the progress of the event, and the alphabetical  
schedule will help you locate individual components. Create a “Program-at-a-  
Glance” overview chart of the entire event as a cross-reference tool, showing

day, date, times, and site/room name. Morrow \(1997\) suggests that the individual  
vendors and contractors will have their own scheduling forms, and you should  
include copies of these for comparison and confirmation purposes.  
Directory  
Create a contact list of all vendors and key stakeholders, including names, all pos-  
sible telephone numbers \(i.e., office, home, cellular, pager, hotel phone, and room  
numbers\), and mailing and e-mail addresses. Do not forget to include your own  
contact information, and make certain that all the appropriate members of your  
staff have copies of this list. Include your organizational chart and staff schedules  
and instructions. In addition, cross-reference your vendor lists by name and service.  
Verification  
All documents, including your proposal, the final contract, correspondence, vendor  
agreements and purchase orders, floor plans, confirmations, invoices, licenses, and  
certificates of insurance, should be at your fingertips in case a question or dispute  
arises on-site. If allowed, put copies of all permits and waivers in your production  
book and keep the originals in a safe place in your office. You might also include cop-  
ies of pertinent policies and regulations that you can present should there be a ques-  
tion about what will and will not be allowed or what should or should not be done.  
# Evaluations  
You must remember that you cannot control results, only actions, but the better  
you control actions, the more likely it is that you will have the results you want.  
Evaluations and research give you the information required to devise and imple-  
ment effective practices and controls that lead to good results. This is a circular  
process \(see Figure 14.5\). As the event coordinator, you must determine what is to  
be evaluated and why, when and where evaluations will take place, how evaluations  
will be conducted and the methods to be used, then integrate the investments of  
time, money, human resources, and space into the event's overall operational plans.  
Begin with the End in Mind  
Harbour \(1997, 65\) states, “Up-front design equals downstream performance.”  
‘To conduct effective evaluations and evaluative research or situation analyses, you  
must determine what knowledge or information is needed and why \(its purpose  
and eventual usage\). Evaluations are either proactive \(seeking information to  
facilitate improvements\) or reactive \(seeking information to validate assumptions  
or justify actions\). They might be performance reviews or customer satisfaction Evaluations 411

ratings. They can be used to gather statistics or develop a customer profile. They  
could be used to determine the value of an event component, examine proce-  
dures, or define future goals. Evaluation instruments should deal with issues that  
are relevant and important to the event operations and the event’s stakeholders.  
The goals and objectives of evaluations must be linked directly to the goals and  
objectives of the event or event organization \(review Figure 2.2, Typical Event  
Objectives, in Chapter 2\).  
Je & 8 6 Oo  
Dana Zita, CSEP, of aNd Logistix, Inc. in Toronto, Canada, regularly con- ducts evaluations, collecting and compiling delegate comments, as a ser- i  
vice for her clients, but she also has a rigorous and comprehensive internal evaluation strategy. “We generate a client evaluation form that is tracked  
from the first contact to the final evaluation. It includes headings linked to  
our critical path planning points and all the items that are important to our |  
quality control. In addition, we maintain an ongoing list of comments and |  
recommendations that is updated weekly throughout the planning pro-  
cess.” Zita notes that each client evaluation is customized with categories  
| specific to each project and indicating whether the client is a first-time or  
repeat customer. These internal evaluation techniques allow her to mine  
| the data collected to develop comprehensive client profiles, track perfor-  
mance, and implement improved client services.

INSIGHT 412 Knowledge Management  
Everyone and Everything Is Involved  
Evaluations and performance reviews must be designed to gather information  
and measurements about the entire event coordination process, including the  
research conducted, the designs and plans developed, the implementation pro-  
cedures, and even the evaluation instruments and activities employed. You must  
evaluate the business plan, marketing plan, communications plan, operational  
plan, risk management plan, and the on-site activities. You might be evaluating  
your procurement procedures, vendor performance, and budget controls. You  
could be seeking audience opinions on the length or location of the event, the  
facilities or accommodations, the quality of the speakers, and/or the meal func-  
tions and special events. You might be conducting evaluations and quantifying  
the results to match the sponsorship opportunity evaluations that current and  
potential commercial sponsors of the event are conducting. You might be con-  
ducting a gap analysis to identify any gaps between customer expectations and  
the service or experience actually received. You could be collecting statistics for  
anything from attendance growth to efficiency studies, carbon offsets to economic  
impact reports, or level of effort to services demand.  
Measure Success and Identify Challenges  
Evaluations provide both qualitative information—attitudes, opinions, prefer-  
ences, and perceptions—and quantitative information—those factors capable of  
being measured or counted, such as demographics, resource allocation, popular-  
ity, improvements, or return on investment \(see Figure 14.6\). Remember that in  
order to quantify evaluation results, rather than collect evaluative research data,  
there must be a baseline measurement against which to compare or measure dif-  
ferences or variances. This baseline measurement might be based on assumptions  
\(what was expected or assumed\) or previously collected data \(historical or com-  
parable data\).  
However, qualitative information can be converted into quantitative data  
by using numerical formats for evaluation instruments so that the appropriate  
statistics can be captured. This will be particularly important when convert-  
ing data to monetary values for calculating the Return on Investment \(ROI\)  
of the event, which “compares the monetary benefits . . . to the costs of the  
\[event\]” \(Phillips, Myhill, and McDonough 2007, 2\). For this, you must be  
able to express the value-per-unit metrics in cost terms—profit increase and  
cost savings \(cost reduction or cost avoidance\), which include the actions and  
the effects of those actions on an organization's bottom line. Phillips, Myhill,  
and McDonough note that hard data \(tangibles such as output, costs, time, and  
quality\) are easier to convert into monetary value than soft data \(intangibles  
such as work habits, work climate/satisfaction, initiative/innovation, customer Evaluations

service, employee development/advancement, and image\), but both are possible  
if objectives are properly identified in measurable terms.  
It has been said that every complaint is a gift. You should not simply seek out  
data or opinions that reinforce your current operations or objectives. You must  
provide the mechanisms for both positive and negative feedback. You should also  
strive to solicit feedback from those who did not choose to attend the event or  
chose not to use your event coordination services. Lost-business reports and surveys  
directed at nonattendees can help in determining how purchase decisions were  
made and what the influencers were.  
Evaluation Instruments and Techniques  
There are numerous methods for conducting evaluations and evaluative research  
\(see Figure 14.7\). The most commonly used instrument is the survey question-  
naire, sometimes referred to as an “opinionnaire,” conducted either in a written  
form or through a verbal interview, and administered either on-site, off-site, or  
online. Rea and Parker \(1992, 5\) assert that surveys can provide descriptive data,  
identify behavioral patterns, and collect attitudinal information about societal  
preferences and opinions, from which, through a random sample survey pro-  
cess, the information derived from a small number of people can be an accu-  
rate representation of a significantly larger population. Surveys are typically  
used at events to collect demographic data, preferences, satisfaction levels,  
and specific feedback.  
Most evaluation surveys include both quantitative and qualitative compo-  
nents in the form of closed-ended questions with fixed response alternatives  
\(see Figure 14.8\) and open-ended questions asking the respondent for other  
comments or opinions pertinent to the topic. Rea and Parker \(1992, 16\) advise  
that a survey should include a “series of unbiased, well-structured questions that  
will systematically obtain the information required,” and survey questions must  
be carefully crafted to ensure a reliable response. The factors to consider include  
the following\: 414

demographic information; often used to develop user- or  
population-specific behavioral profiles.  
A written or oral series of questions used to test recall and retention;  
often used at the conclusion of training programs or sessions.  
A card or form allowing individuals to provide positive or negative  
comments and ideas; often included within surveys as “venting”  
questions.  
An open discussion with group of 8-12 people with similar  
demographics and a trained moderator in a friendly environment;  
used to discover attitudes, opinions, usage situations, and  
conscious/subconscious motivations.  
A one-on-one interview with targeted informants with a high  
level of expertise used to elicit expert attitudes, opinions, and  
preferences.

Response Types  
\* Formatting of questions—Closed-ended questions should have sufficient and  
logical alternatives, as opposed to open-ended and/or “venting” questions.  
Screening questions qualify or disqualify respondents. Formatting includes  
appropriate levels or types of measurement.  
\* Phrasing of questions—Use suitable vocabulary level, use neutral bias wording  
and phrases to solicit and welcome all points of view, avoid ambiguity or  
inappropriate emphasis, and avoid multipurpose questions.  
\* Sequencing of questions—Introductory questions should elicit uncompli-  
cated opinion or factual information; sensitive questions \(e.g., affiliations, 416 Knowledge Management  
ethnicity, etc.\) should be placed late in the interview or questionnaire to  
limit participation rejection. ;  
\* Categories of questions—Appropriately group questions into topics, issues,  
or objectives with headings.  
Phillips, Breining, and Phillips \(2008, 94\) recommend that, among other  
things, you keep survey statements as simple as possible, design the survey for easy  
tabulation, and ensure that responses are anonymous.  
You should use a variety of written, verbal, and visual methods to provide a viable  
and valuable evaluation. You need to identify positive and negative surprises. You  
must collect data. You must ask for opinions and observations. You should listen  
to everyone. Deborah Borsum, CSEP, CERP, CMD, noted that her organization  
received some of its most important evaluation data at one of its events from the  
parking personnel who received and overheard guest comments as they were depart-  
ing the event. Asking for comments and listening to the answers is a kind of dialogue,  
and dialogue is critical to effective communications as well as customer service.  
To get a good return ratio of responses, the survey or other evaluation instru-  
ment must be short and simple, with a logical flow and varied format. It must be  
administered at the right time to the right population in the right place. Resist the  
temptation to include too much in a single survey instrument. Don’ ask for data  
you dont need, and avoid peripheral, extraneous, or tangential questions that do  
not directly relate to the primary purpose of the evaluation.  
Keep in mind that many evaluation instruments such as opinion surveys are  
“opt-in” by nature \(participation is a choice rather than a requirement\); the results  
might be skewed unless it can be shown to be an accurate sample or representa-  
tion of the event population as a whole. This is why you might need to consider  
using a professional research and polling service to conduct your survey activities  
when valid statistics are critical. For example, a festival or a trade show might be  
considering major \(and costly\) changes in its content and marketing plan. Such  
decisions typically need very sophisticated evaluation instruments \(often more  
than one\) and a very structured distribution and collection system to ensure an  
accurate sampling.  
Visionary Analysis  
Once you have all the necessary evaluation data, you must analyze, quantify, and  
qualify the information and then compile it into useful reports that will serve  
your current obligations and contribute to your future endeavors and forecasting  
activities. Know your numbers, create a cost-benefit analysis, capture the statistics,  
track trends, analyze and cross-reference your findings, and connect the data to  
the goals and objectives of the event. Incorporate this business and institutional  
intelligence into the vision for your future events and event endeavors. The Power of Reports  
417  
The Power of Reports  
Reports constitute a significant component of communications as well as knowl-  
edge management, including information acquisition and distribution. Reports  
and reporting procedures, which facilitate the timely and efficient circulation of  
information to those who need it, might include budgets, evaluations, incident  
reports, meeting minutes, progress reports, recaps and reviews, and other informa-  
tion. However, no one wants or needs a useless report. Understand how and when  
reports should be prepared, who needs them, and why. Use reports to confirm  
and justify your decisions and decision-making processes. Use reports to monitor  
planning timelines and performance standards. Use reports to validate your value  
to your client, your employer, and event stakeholders. The point is—use them,  
don't let them languish in a drawer. Remember, no report should be generated just  
to generate a report. The quintessential book on parliamentary procedure, Roberts  
Rules of Order \(Robert 1970, 420\), outlines the best way to organize a detailed  
report, which can serve as a guideline for preparing your reports\:  
1. A description of the way in which the reporting body undertook its charge  
2. The facts uncovered or information obtained  
3. The findings or conclusions derived from the facts or information  
4. The resolutions or recommendations based on the findings or conclusions  
Using Status Reports  
Status reports and updates are used to monitor and verify the progress of plans through-  
out the event coordination process. They are also used to detect variances between esti-  
mated and actual performance of scheduling, costs, and/or personnel, and they allow  
the timely implementation of controls and corrective actions as well as help to develop  
future planning strategies. Progress reports let the event team know the status of activity  
and the upcoming actions, or as Dana Zita, CSEP, puts it, “Where we are and what's  
going to happen within the week or the next 30 days.” The methods of reporting \(e.g.,  
written, electronic, conference call, etc.\) and the frequency of preparation and presenta-  
tion must be established at the beginning of the planning process, with status reports  
linked to the critical junctures or milestones of the planning process.  
Creating Visibility and Value  
Reports are communication mechanisms that provide not only visibility of the event  
operations during the event coordination process, but also visibility of the event team  
to external stakeholders. They should also be used to illustrate the value of the invest-  
ment in the event and in the services of the professional event coordinator. They  
might be used to illustrate the achievement of goals to clients or upper management, 418

sponsors, the public and public officials, volunteers, and other important stakeholders  
\(or stockholders in the case of corporate entities\). Although you might want the event  
operations to be invisible to the guest \(“Oh, you do parties. What fun!”\), you want  
your client or upper management to realize the full scope of your duties, responsibili-  
ties, abilities, and value.  
The professional event coordinator will often have responsibility for reporting  
the final results of an event to stakeholders, which can include financial reports,  
attendance reports, and executive summaries reviewing performance and cost-  
benefit analyses. Depending on the recipient, final reports should review perfor-  
mance, processes, and outcomes using anecdotal, statistical, and empirical data.  
Use percentages to illustrate growth, impact, and the allocation of resources. For  
example, an increase of 100 attendees over the previous year’s 1,000 attendees  
would be a 10 percent increase, but over the previous year’s attendance of 10,000  
would be only a 1 percent increase—simply reporting the 100-attendee increase  
does not tell the whole story. Tell your story with graphs and graphics that show  
the meanings associated with the measurements and raw data \(see Figure 14.9\),  
but make sure they are clear, consistent, and relevant. Documentation and Archives  
419  
Documentation and Archives  
Information and data collected and generated are only part of a knowledge man-  
agement system. O”Toole and Mikolaitis \(2002, 59\) contend, “Knowledge is  
now viewed as a major factor in creating a competitive edge; therefore, the event  
library, with all of the documentation related to an event, must be protected, as  
it is both historically and currently valuable.” The professional event coordinator  
must ensure that information is captured correctly and saved in a manner that  
puts the data to productive and profitable use.  
The Purpose of Documentation  
Documents and documentation provide the historical records you will use in your  
research for an event. You will look at previous events done for a client when plan-  
ning a new one for that client, and look at similar events for a new event for a new  
client. You will want to review various costings, venue specifications, and assorted  
evaluations when creating an event design, developing a site plan, or preparing a  
bid document. The event records and materials. might be used for reference, com-  
parisons, inspiration, forecasting, feasibility analyses, tracking growth, illustrating  
capabilities, and numerous other functions.  
Documentation is also evidentiary. You might need to trace your decision-  
making process or demonstrate your experience. Photographs and other materials  
might serve as objective evidence in either the boardroom or the courtroom. This  
evidence could trigger your memory—for example, by allowing you to view room  
setups and props used—or provide proof in defense of billing disputes, claims, or  
lawsuits. Certain records must be retained in accordance with tax regulations and  
other legal requirements, such as financial records, personnel records, accident  
or incident reports, safety or fire inspection reports, and legal correspondence,  
among others. You should confirm, with the appropriate legal counsel and/or  
certified public accountant, what records must be retained and for how long.  
Documentation Procedures  
First and foremost, you must make documentation a standard operating proce-  
dure—it must be part of the routine, a habit. Write things down, or as Cal Kennedy,  
CSEP. says, “Log it!” Use conversation diaries to document phone calls and discus-  
sions, and follow up with a written review or confirmation. Save everything from the  
first notes to the final reports. Maintain a chronological perspective by making certain  
all documents are dated and stored in chronological order, using copies if necessary.  
Make certain the originals of legally pertinent documents are stored safely. Be sure  
to retain all electronic records such as e-mails as well.  
Archival materials from an individual event should be stored together, including  
numerous copies of all brochures, flyers, advertising specialties, and posters, plus press 420  
Knowledge Management  
clippings and other materials. Photos should be cataloged by event and perhaps also  
by subject matter. You might wish to digitally scan key photos for your marketing pur-  
poses, or all your photos for efficient storage. Photographs, slides, videos, CD-ROMs,  
and other media must be stored correctly according to the specific recommendations  
for each medium. Reference and resource material, such as catalogs, periodicals, and  
price lists, should be organized and stored so you can access them easily.  
Archives—the Legacy of Information  
It has been said that good judgment comes from experience, and experience  
comes from bad judgment. The history of an event and its operations is part of  
an event organization's institutional memory. It provides important insight into

In December 2001, the International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) launched  
an Olympics-related knowledge service program known as Olympic Games  
Knowledge Services \(OGKS\) to provide knowledge management services to  
host cities and bidding cities, as well as to offer advice, support, and knowledge  
services for organizers of other major international events.  
The OGKS grew out of the IOC's Transfer of Olympic Knowledge \(TOK\)  
Program. The TOK was initiated by the IOC during preparation for the 2000  
Sydney Games in conjunction with the Sydney Organizing Committee for the  
Olympic Games \(SOCOG\) as part of the host city contract deliverables—the  
preparation of an official report \(known internally as the Post Games Report\).  
It was instituted to formalize the transfer of knowledge and information  
assets from one Games host to the next, passing on “how we did it here” to  
the organizing committees in Salt Lake City, Athens, Beijing, and beyond.  
Craig McLatchey, former secretary general for the Sydney Games and CEO  
of OGKS, said that the program “will provide event hosts key information and  
systems to help them stage these major complex events; through this we will

its practices, policies, and priorities, which is invaluable in conducting feasibility  
studies, strategic analyses, and administrative audits. Digital or paper documents,  
photographs, videos, audiotapes, and advertising specialties might all be used to  
shape and refine future designing, planning, coordination, marketing, evaluation,  
and risk management activities. Press clippings might be used to plan a public  
relations strategy. Committee rosters might identify potential volunteer leaders.  
Event brochures might be used in sponsorship solicitations. Pictorial portfolios  
might be used to illustrate your capabilities or show clients possible theme ideas.  
Spreading out all the old advertising specialties and event keepsakes might be the  
starting point for a brainstorming session. The uses are endless, but none of them  
are possible unless you have the records and materials saved and accessible.  
Wrap Up  
In the field of event coordination, knowledge management is the acquisition,  
organization, and control of the information resources and records associated  
with an event and an event organization. The professional event coordinator must  
identify and analyze these resources in order to develop effective systems for man-  
aging them. The use of computer technology and document design techniques  
will facilitate efficient data processing procedures, including the tracing, tracking,  
retrieval, and protection of the valuable documentation that supports the entire  
event coordination process. All such documentation is included in the production  
book \(as appropriate\), which should contain schedule, directory, and verification  
materials pertinent to the on-site event operations and communications.  
The professional event coordinator must plan for and utilize evaluation tech-  
niques to gather the measurements, opinions, and feedback that contribute to the  
research-evaluation continuum used to define and direct activities, efforts, and  
priorities. Evaluation activities and instruments must be designed to link directly  
with the goals and objectives of an event and the event organization, and must  
be conducted in a comprehensive, system-wide manner. The data collected must  
be analyzed carefully and compiled into reports that will be used throughout the  
event coordination operation to improve practices and increase the return on  
the investment of future event resources.  
Other reports are used throughout the event coordination process to verify  
the status of plans and the effectiveness of procedures, as well as to acquire and  
distribute necessary information to event stakeholders in a timely manner. This  
important aspect of the overall event communications plan provides visibility for  
the event project and personnel and should be used to communicate the value  
of the project and the personnel.  
Systematic documentation practices must be established as standard operating  
procedures to ensure that the collection and distribution of information is automatic 422 Knowledge Management  
and consistent. The library of data captured and archived provides the histori-  
cal and evidentiary records that constitute the institutional memory of the event  
organization. These archives provide a legacy of information that might be used  
to ensure the growth and sustainability of the event and to ensure that the event  
organization can profit from its own experience.

425 small group of community leaders were meeting with an event coordinator to  
\~ \\develop a public event that they hoped woutd increase tourism during the city’s  
slowest season. Lots of creative ideas were discussed regarding themes and activities  
that would showcase the city’s unique assets and attractions. The community leaders  
were getting very excited; they were sure this event would become a signature event  
that would create worldwide recognition for the city. As soon as the community lead-  
ers started to talk about all the benefits that could be reaped immediately and as the  
event grew in size and reputation, the event coordinator felt compelled to inject a  
Sree of reality into the conversaucn\: “You won't know it will be a success until it has  
become successful.”

Success is defined in many ways. It is measured in many different ways. It is  
viewed from many different perspectives. It can mean accomplishing an intended  
purpose or favorable outcome, achievement of an objective, acquiring personal or  
financial security, or reaching a professional ambition. However, in the context of  
events \(and in many other ways\) success is rarely static—\*Success is a journey, not  
a destination” \(Sweetland 1978\). True success must be sustainable. Sustainable suc-  
cess means the ability to continue, grow, and endure. As Confucius said, “Success  
depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to  
be failure.” Sustainable success for events requires preparing for and responding  
to the perspectives and impacts of the responsibilities shown in Figure 15.1.

Sustainability The Future of Events  
427  
The Future of Events  
Since the beginning of human history, people have gathered together to share  
their beliefs and experiences, their successes and frustrations, and their joys and  
sorrows. We come together to exhibit our triumphs and sell our merchandise, to  
tell our stories and teach our skills, and to show off our prowess and celebrate our  
culture. Tens of thousands of trade shows and meetings take place around the  
world every week. Hundreds of thousands of weddings and reunions occur every  
year. Millions of people attend and participate in sports events every day, and billions  
of people view major events such as the Olympic Games on television and the  
Internet. Events “touch virtually every life on the planet several times over” every  
year \(Schmader 2009\).  
There is no question that there will always be events—some small, some large;  
some simple, some complex; some in-person, some electronic; some near, some  
far away. The future of events, however, will most likely involve a broader spectrum  
of expectations focusing on value, professional proficiency, and the protection of  
natural, human, and cultural resources. In other words, we must become better  
at what we do if we wish to endure, and must adopt the medical ethics principle  
of “First, do no harm.”  
An Integrated Discipline  
Professional event coordination encompasses administrative, design, marketing,  
operational, and risk management tasks and competencies \(review the scope of  
the International EMBOK Model in Chapter 1\). These five areas of expertise are  
inextricably connected and woven together, each one affecting and relying on all the  
others. As discussed throughout this book, the professional event coordinator has  
administrative, design, and operational duties to perform in bringing together the  
right event elements and service providers; must deal with the marketing influ-  
ences that permeate every aspect of the event experience; and has risk management  
responsibilities associated with absolutely every component. These abilities and  
responsibilities simply cannot be segregated—they must be completely integrated.  
You may or may not be responsible for directing strategic planning or policy  
development for an event organization, managing the financial and/or human  
resources, designing and installing the event’s décor, creating the marketing plans  
for an event, or formulating the risk management plans, but you will, at the  
very least, need to be a contributor to and a participant in these processes and  
procedures. As a professional, you must strive to fully understand and master  
each discipline to become a better \(and more valuable\) partner in the success and  
sustainability of the event and the event organization. This becomes exponentially  
more important as you seek advancement within this profession. 428 Sustainable Success  
The Role of Sustainability  
Sustainability is not focused solely on environmental protection. Sustainable manage-  
ment uses a triple bottom line approach \(people, planet, profit\) that measures business  
performance in a way that recognizes the ways in which social, environmental, and  
economic bottom lines are interdependent \(see Figure 15.2\). This approach is reflected  
in many sustainability measurement and reporting standards such as the global report-  
ing initiative \(GRI\), environmental social governance \(ESG\) reporting, and corporate  
social responsibility \(CSR\) reporting, and is incorporated into event-specific standards  
such as British Standards’ BS 8901\:2009, Specification fora sustainability management  
system for events; the APEX/ASTM Environmentally Sustainable Meeting Standards;  
and the International Organization for Standardization’s \[SO 20121\: Sustainability  
in event management. The Dictionary of Sustainable Management \(Presidio Graduate  
School 2010\) suggests the triple bottom line criteria used to assess sustainable prod-  
ucts, services, and other activities often include the following\:  
\* Social criteria—Socially desirable, culturally acceptable, and psychologically  
nurturing  
\* Economic criteria—Economically sustainable, technologically feasible, and  
operationally viable  
\* Environmental criteria—Environmentally robust, generationally sensitive,  
and capable of continuous learning

INSIGHT 430 Sustainable Success  
Green Expectations  
Making events “greener” typically centers on lessening the impact that the event  
will have on the ecosystem from such things as waste generation, energy demands,  
pollution, and habitat degradation. This is done by employing procurement prac-  
tices and design features that reduce waste and emissions throughout the event  
operations. These activities must also take into consideration the intergenerational  
responsibility to ensure a sustainable society, as well as ensuring the economic  
benefits extend to all the stakeholders involved in or impacted by the event. This  
holistic perspective will enable event organizations to manage the impact on their  
surroundings and its inhabitants.  
Consider the Community  
Decisions about an event must include the impact these decisions will have on those  
affected by the event and its operations. Stakeholder engagement will help ensure  
that the health, safety, and comfort of event participants and the local community are  
considered in the short- and long-term management of natural and other resources.  
Many communities and local facilities have environmental initiatives that the profes-  
sional event coordinator can take advantage of, including such things as waste diver-  
sion programs, renewable energy options, and community outreach opportunities.  
Event organizations should invest in the local community whenever possible.  
This is particularly true for larger events where facilities and infrastructure must  
be built or improved to accommodate the event, but all events should consider  
investment in local skills and employment as well. Not only does this benefit  
the local economy through skills development and job creation, it reduces the  
environmental impact of bringing in personnel from distant locations, thereby  
reducing costs and carbon emissions.  
You must look at the “quality of life” impact the event will have on the community.  
This can include such negative impacts as reduced access to transportation and other  
infrastructure, traffic disruptions and congestion, noise pollution, and increased costs  
of goods and services \(Bob 2010\). Solutions for mitigating these impacts can range  
from infrastructural improvements \(for major events\), to collaboration with com-  
munity leaders to identify alternatives and preferred solutions \(for smaller events\), to  
aggressive communication initiatives that identify local opportunities for procurement,  
employment, and philanthropic programs \(Bowdin et al. 2006; Bob 2010\).  
The Economics of “Green”  
Procurement is a major aspect of making events “greener.” Purchasing goods and  
services locally can reduce costs as well as the environmental impacts of travel  
and transportation associated with importing materials and personnel. Some Green Expectations  
431  
event organizations have determined a radius within which they will source and  
select suppliers, such as local printing services, amenity providers, speakers or  
entertainers, and locally grown foods. Others consider this radius to determine  
if attendee demand would benefit from holding regional rather than national or  
international events, and if incorporating virtual components will be cost effec-  
tive and advisable. Site selection is also involved; centralized locations can reduce  
negative impacts as well as individual costs to attend \(perhaps improving overall  
attendance\).  
Event organizations need to accurately measure the costs and benefits of their  
environmental protection activities. This begins with an “eco-audit” to determine  
how much resource consumption and waste generation occurs during your event,  
as well as throughout the organization’s day-to-day operations. Then the costs  
of these baseline measurements must be determined and benchmarks should be  
established for improvement. Finally, you must keep track of these activities so  
that improvements and change can be truthfully measured and reported to event  
stakeholders. Simply claiming your event is “green” or promoting resource conser-  
vation policies and practices without rigorously adhering to them often results in  
what is called greenwashing—the intentional misrepresentation of environmental  
benefits. It has to be real and measureable; otherwise it will backfire on you.  
Organizations producing or bidding on very large international events, such  
as a World’s Fair or the Olympic Games, that require capital improvements for  
infrastructure \(¢.g., transportation systems\) and the building of new venues need  
to consider the legacy these investments will leave, as well as the impact they  
will have on existing land use and current and future residents \(Getz 2007\). For  
example, the sustainability plan for the 2012 Olympic Games includes ensuring no  
waste is sent to landfills during the Games and encouraging the development of  
new waste-processing infrastructure in East London \(London 2012 Organising  
Committee 2010\), although at the time of this writing there is already doubt about  
its feasibility. Habitat destruction and resident displacement or interference are key  
concerns when considering these mega-events \(Bob 2010\), but small events have  
the same responsibility to protect the environmental and social impacts of their  
activities. Leave it better than the way you found it.  
Eco-Friendly Practices  
Knowing what you do and what products and services you use will set the stage  
for devising and implementing eco-friendly policies and practices. One of the first  
ways to approach this is to fully recognize the life cycle of the products you and  
your suppliers use \(see Figure 15.3\). Simply purchasing products that are organic  
or created using renewable resources does not guarantee they are eco-friendly.  
You must look at the entire supply chain. Where do the raw materials come from, 432  
Sustainable Success  
Greenhouse Gas Emissions  
Sreches  
Disposal  
Figure 15.3  
Silvers’ Overview of  
Product Life Cycle  
Impacts  
Water Pollution/Ground Contamination  
and are they renewable? What pollutants does their manufacture emit? How far do  
the finished products travel to get to your event? Are there environmental impacts  
associated with their use? What happens to them after they are used? Many events  
seek a zero-waste or carbon-neutral goal, but this can only be achieved when the entire  
product life cycle is analyzed. For example, Annie Leonard \(www.storyofstuff  
.com\) says that “for every pound of garbage we recycle or divert on site, we miss  
another 70 pounds hidden in the supply chain that ends at the loading dock”  
\(Beer 2010\).  
Water and energy conservation, and waste, pollution, and emissions reduction  
strategies can be employed throughout the event's operations and its supply chain.  
For example, many hotels and event facilities are employing low-flow toilets and  
motion-detector lighting systems. Institute an eco-friendly procurement policy  
that gives preferential ratings to suppliers that comply with sustainable standards,  
such as the certifications shown in Figure 15.4.  
Rethink, eliminate, reduce, recycle, reuse, and otherwise redirect waste \(review  
the Recycling Checklist, Figure 4.8, in Chapter 4\). What can you do differently?  
What can you do without? What can you do to keep materials from ending up  
in the landfill? For example, event coordinators are reducing or eliminating paper  
use for invitations, handouts, menus, and other communications. Bottled water  
is being replaced with bulk water stations, allowing one event coordinator, for  
example, to eliminate the disposal of more than 4,000 plastic bottles at an annual  
five-hour gala \(Byford 2010\). Another event, a five-day conference for 40,000  
attendees, reported an estimated \$1.5 million in savings by eliminating bottled  
water, and included stations where attendees could pedal stationary bicycles to  
charge their electronic devices such as cell phones and laptops \(Doyle 2010\).  
And a Rosen College of Hospitality Management student, Renea Anderson, won  
several international awards for her zero-waste design for the “next generation” in  
exhibit space using recycled and repurposed shipping containers \(University of  
Central Florida 2010\). Green Expectations

Luxury and environmental responsibility are not mutually exclusive. The Eco  
Serendib Villa and Spa \(www.ecoserendib.com\), a visionary project led by  
Harith Wickrema, an adjunct faculty member at Temple University School of  
ON-SITE INSIGHTTourism and Hospitality Management and president of Harith Productions  
Ltd. \(www.harithproductions.com\), was created in order to showcase envi-  
ronmentally friendly products and services in a luxury setting. Wickrema  
notes, “The target market of this project is industry leaders and decision  
makers; the best way to reach such influential people is through a luxury  
experience.’ Located on St. John of the U.S. Virgin Islands, guests are encouraged  
to immerse themselves in a full locovore experience, meaning the consumption  
of locally produced products and services.  
Every aspect of Eco Serendib practices environmental responsibility,  
including water and electricity conservation, and usage of recycled products  
and products that are free from synthetic ingredients and chemicals. “For

example,” Wickrema explains, “the villa and spa uses many LEED and Energy  
Star-rated products, the Wolf and Sub-Zero kitchen equipment is made from  
75 percent recycled stainless steel, and 50 percent of the refrigerator is recy-  
cled plastic. The washing machine uses cold water and ozone, thus reducing  
water usage by 35 percent. The dryer reduces the drying time by 50 to 60  
percent per use.”  
Although Wickrema admits that this is NOT a 100 percent green prop-  
erty, a stay at the Eco Serendib Villa and Spa will enlighten guests with the  
understanding that it is not necessary to sacrifice luxury for environmental  
responsibility. “Our intention is to edutain \(educate and entertain\) today’s  
influential leaders through an unforgettable luxury experience so that eco-  
friendly products and services will be more affordable for tomorrow's aver-  
age consumer. The theory behind this practice is\: increased demand of green  
products and services from top-level executives leads to increased produc-  
tion; increased production leads to a decrease in the unit cost of production.  
Our goal is to apply basic economic concepts to increase the accessibility of  
green products for everyone”  
Harith received the 2009 “Greenest Planner Award,’ sponsored by MeetingNews,  
Successful Meetings magazine, and the Green Travel Summit.  
Global Vision  
The world in which events take place has shrunk and expanded at the same time.  
The globe is the same size, but is shrinking because it is now connected through  
technology. This connectivity also expands the world by increasing the events  
market; destinations are vying for all types of events, attendees are traveling the  
globe to events, and providers of event goods and services are finding clients and  
customers worldwide. Events are being produced and promoted as an important  
component of tourism initiatives in developed and developing nations, using  
locations that range from already famous to newly discovered. This often results  
in substantial economic benefits but sometimes results in unintended and unfor-  
tunate consequences for habitats, inhabitants, and traditions. What we do, how  
we do it, and where we do it now have impacts that can circumnavigate the globe  
in seconds, minutes, hours, days, and perhaps forever. Global Vision  
435  
People and Their Places  
In order to be sustainable, events need to consider the human capital that is  
invested in or squandered by the event, or is simply overlooked. Sustainable  
events seek ways in which to find and continuously develop a pool of qualified  
personnel, thereby facilitating diversity and social progress within a community,  
or within a community of practice \(i.e., an organization or industry association\).  
The people who work at events or work for event providers can come from all  
age groups, economic backgrounds, and places of work or residence. Workforce  
demands now and in the future necessitate mobility in both location and skills,  
something that events can foster throughout the life of the event and the legacy it  
leaves within the community.  
Event plans should also include strategies for ensuring equality, fairness, and  
human rights in personnel and purchasing decisions; creating opportunities and  
giving access to underserved or qualified but previously disadvantaged groups \(Bob  
2010\). Event designs and activities need to demonstrate respect for the culture in  
which they take place, avoiding practices and policies that disregard commonly  
held beliefs, values, or traditions. Events need to acknowledge, interpret, and  
incorporate the cultural heritage of the place and its people \(Bowdin et al. 2006\).  
It’s a Global Economy  
Sustainability for events and event organizations requires recognition that it is  
a global economy now, even though it might seem to only be locally pertinent.  
Strategic thinking regarding internal goals, objectives, and priorities, as well as  
external conditions, trends, and market forces, is necessary for events to be able  
to survive and thrive. Competition as well as collaboration can come from any  
corner of the world, as can threats to and opportunities for the event’s economic  
interests. Event companies are merging into global entities, and as companies  
pursue expanded geographic markets, they are looking for event companies with  
this type of global presence.  
Technology has made much of this global economy possible, and technology  
will be an integral part of an event organization's ability to compete in this global  
marketplace as we become increasingly connected. The benefits of technology  
can be economic and strategic, as illustrated by Cisco Systems, Inc.’s 2009 annual  
four-day sales meeting for 22,000 employees from 104 countries, which was held  
in a completely virtual platform and included 58 keynotes, 124 executive chat sessions,  
and 88 hours of consecutive educational sessions, and measured 211 million air  
miles not flown and a 90 percent cost savings \(Jakobson 2010\).  
The events industry would be well advised to come together as a united industry  
that embraces its similarities while respecting its specialties. Collecting industrywide  
data and statistics such as event spending could illustrate the economic power of 436 Sustainable Success  
events to internal, external, local, national, and international stakeholders, which  
could influence community-based and high-level policy making and investment.  
Such recognition would also bring increased credibility to the purpose of events  
and the value of the practitioners producing them.  
The Local-to-Global Connection  
The environmental aspect of a global vision is the connection every act could have  
on the global commons—those things that are shared by everyone in the world. This  
perspective suggests that environmental abuses or incidents have far-reaching effects  
when emissions, pollutants, or disease agents enter the atmosphere, hydrosphere,  
or biosphere. This becomes readily apparent when natural or manmade disasters  
such as volcanic ash clouds or uncontrolled oil spills occur, and when influenza  
epidemics spread worldwide in a matter of weeks. But the small things count as  
well; they add up over time and frequency \(a bucket will overflow given enough  
drops\). Events must consider the impact they have on neighboring land, people,  
waterways, and air quality, as well as the effects such global incidents could have  
on their ability to deliver the event as envisioned.  
Sustainability-related standards have been developed by various nations and  
international organizations \(e.g., BS 8901, ISO 20121, and others\) in an effort  
to harmonize practices and policy making in a global context. These sustainable  
development standards focus on the principles of transparency, integrity, inclusiy-  
ity, and environmental stewardship. It is in the best interests of an event or event  
organization to embrace these standards so that they are recognized as part of the  
solution as well as part of the global community. For example, client companies  
with sustainability missions want to \(and often must\) work with event partners  
that meet globally recognized sustainability standards. Even those clients or event  
hosts that do not have sustainability mandates will recognize the leadership an  
event organization demonstrates when offering opportunities in alignment with  
these standards.  
Growth Approach  
The essence of sustainability is the ability to endure into the future, which means  
the ability to grow in order to retain economic and functional viability. Events  
and event organizations must grow, perhaps in size but definitely in terms of  
maturity. Those organizations and individuals that do not continuously improve  
their performance capabilities will not be in a position to create or take advantage  
of the opportunities necessary to survive in the ever expanding and competitive  
events marketplace. Well-trained personnel are essential throughout the industry's Growth Approach  
437  
supply chain. Carefully planned event strategies are crucial to positive economic  
outcomes. Progressive and thoroughly integrated environmental protection plans  
are an obligation for every event organization that seeks to serve its stakeholders.  
Tomorrow’s Human Resources  
Work force development is fundamental to an event organization's ability to survive  
and thrive. It is also important to communities seeking to benefit from the  
event and hospitality industry through employment opportunities for their citizenry.  
Capacity planning—anticipating and creating the environment and appropriate  
resources necessary to handle the future workload—should be incorporated into  
your personal, organizational, and/or societal human resources strategy.

Philipp Mondor, senior vice-president of the Canadian Tourism Human Resource  
# ON-SITE  
Council \(CTHRC\), provides the following perspective on the challenges  
associated with creating a sustainable workforce.  
| INSIGHT  
Most developed countries have become increasingly dependent on knowl-  
‘edge-based economies in their pursuit and expansion of global markets. The  
same is true for the events industry. The export of products and services is  
influenced by unprecedented changes in technology and the consequence  
of changing demographics. With aging populations, the scarcity of quali-  
fied workers grows along with the demand for greater labor mobility. Skilled  
workers from developing countries have opportunities for employment and  
prosperity, which they might not otherwise have in their own country.  
Organized events have also become increasingly more complex. Acts of  
terrorism and organized protests have become common. Unskilled work-  
ers and lack of training has put the public in danger and, worse still, caused  
fatalities. Great numbers of event patrons have suffered food-borne illness  
or found themselves trapped in overcrowded venues with inadequate exits.  
More than ever before, there is a greater emphasis on managing risk and  
the concern for public health and safety, recognizing that organized events are  
subject to human error, deliberate sabotage, and unpredictable events caused  
solely by the effects of nature.  
Event organizers are now expected to apply sound project management  
principles, manage more complex safety and risk variables, and integrate con-  
cepts such as sustainability. Event organizers are increasingly more mobile,  
continues 438 Sustainable Success  
LMA A CNN TTL ETC TL A CC A CC  
and consequently, they are subject to. increased conditions, such as com-  
pliance with local regulations and the ability to accommodate local customs.  
As an emerging and growing profession, the changes that have impacted the  
industry present an opportunity and an imperative\: Event organizers must  
demonstrate competency against an industry-recognized standard.  
To compete in a knowledge-based economy, the sector needs to build  
capacity for learning and training that widens access to learning opportunities  
for individuals and for enterprises, and increases labor force productivity.  
To be able to compete successfully in the global market and continue to be  
productive domestically, the event industry requires more advanced skills  
and education and frequent renewal of skills; it must invest in skilled human  
capital in order to thrive. One way to do this is with a global competency-based  
certification program.  
Certification is an industry credential granted to professionals who have  
demonstrated competency against a standard. A global certification program  
will bring cohesion to the sector and raise the overall profile of the profession;  
it isa way of demonstrating the complexity and scope of the profession while  
promoting greater mobility of learners and workers.  
The industry must set the standard for a certification program to meet these  
objectives. Expert, well-experienced practitioners who are representative of the  
range and complexity of the event industry must define what is expected in  
the field. The standards must be benchmarked against current best practices,  
and contain sufficient specificity and context to define what is competent.  
A well-crafted international competency standard is relevant and applicable to  
practice in more than one country, and can allow for tailoring to reflect cultural  
differences or local practices. These standards are coherent, rigorous, and based  
on consensus. They reflect current and emergent practice, support accessibility,  
and are voluntary. Most importantly, professionals who meet the standard are  
recognized as top in their field and among the best in the world.

Economic Viability  
Deborah Borsum, CSEP, CERP, CMD, notes that many people enter the event  
industry because they think it is fun and creative, which it is, but what they fail  
to realize is that, first and foremost, it is a business. An event, event business, or  
event organization cannot hope to endure unless it maintains economic viability.  
Without a constant influx and responsible use of financial \(and human\) resources, Growth Approach  
439  
it will stagnate and eventually fail. O” Toole \(2010, 37\) advises that events and event  
organizations need time to develop, often three years or more, during which time  
“stakeholders must be certain of the stability of an event before they will \[become\]  
involved.” Strategic development of products, services, delivery systems, markets, and  
stakeholders will facilitate the economic growth necessary to compete and continue.  
Working smarter increases productivity and profitability, and typically involves  
the integration of technology throughout an event's operations, and requires systems  
thinking. “An organization that embraces systems thinking—understanding the link-  
ages, interactions, and processes of systems and system elements—is capable of con-  
tinuous improvement that will lead to increased safety, security, and sustainability”  
\(Silvers 2008, 179\). Systems thinking encompasses conceptual systems as well as  
technological systems; procedural systems that are standardized and thoroughly  
integrated into day-to-day operations can reduce errors and facilitate continuous  
improvement. For example, checklists that must actually be checked off might seem  
cumbersome or time consuming, but they can prevent costly mistakes.  
Environmental Management  
Supply chain management goes hand in hand with procurement management,  
both of which need to incorporate sound economic, environmental, and ethical  
purchase decisions. Not only do purchases need to provide value and be fit for  
purpose, they also need to align with environmental protection responsibilities.  
Build a network of suppliers that recognize the life-cycle impact of their products  
or services \(and those in their supply chain\) and have practices established that  
mitigate destructive environmental effects. Collaborate with your suppliers to  
find better materials, processes, and solutions.  
Growth often means expansion and innovation. Be aware of what impact that  
might have on the ecosystem in which an event or event's business activity takes  
place. This is especially important for outdoor events and events using unique  
locations. Disturbance, displacement, or destruction of flora and fauna can have neg-  
ative \(and sometimes lasting\) effects. Events should protect the existing biodiversity  
in natural habitats and species \(Bowdin et al. 2006\) and protect sites of archaeological  
or cultural interest \(British Standards 2009\). All event sites should optimize the use of  
previously developed land, and newly developed land should either be restored or  
create opportunities to enhance habitats or future uses.  
Protection of current and future natural resources should be integrated  
throughout all current and future event practices and plans. Renewable energy  
and substances, air quality, watercourses, land use, and all living things must be  
taken into consideration. None should be sacrificed in the pursuit of growth.  
Find ways to improve resource efficiency and think prevention rather than cure  
\(British Standards 2009\). And don’t forget to involve the event attendee in 440 Sustainable Success  
your environmental activities; let them know how they can become involved in your  
sustainability activities. .  
Professional Endurance  
Event professionals enter this career through many portals, follow many different  
paths, and achieve varying levels of success, but one thing is clear\: Your career  
will wither and die unless you actively seek growth and change. Finding your  
way in can include an entry-level job in an industry sector or with an industry  
supplier, the expansion of duties in a nonindustry job, formal education, volun-  
teerism, or by sheer happenstance. Keep in mind that employment can be found  
in seemingly unrelated disciplines or specializations, and job titles might not  
include “event” in them \(Nelson and Silvers 2009\). Career progression could fol-  
low a ladder \(progressing upward step-by-step in increasing levels of authority in  
a single job or company\), or a stream wherein your career flows like water flowing  
into tributaries \(moving in new directions\) or navigating downriver into increas-  
ingly complex and challenging roles and projects. Career counselors advise that  
successful careers depend on being able to sustain drive, commitment, engage-  
ment, and passion, and that career growth requires personal and professional  
development—updating your skills and knowledge, as well as “network” development—  
building and boosting relationships within your community of practice.  
Career Paths and Credentials  
It has been argued that the event industry has not yet become a true profession  
because licensing, certification, or a recognized degree is not required as a con-  
dition of practice or employment. Anyone can have business cards made at a  
quick-print shop, but these do not ensure success or provide assurance of ability.  
And there are numerous entities on the Internet that offer inexpensive and almost  
instant certificates in event planning, yet these also do not indicate proficiency or  
confirm credibility. Degrees from academic institutions do not guarantee imme-  
diate high-level and high-paying jobs to graduates. Careers in event management  
are built over time. Education \(or training\) is what will equip you to enter the  
profession, but experience is what will allow you to succeed.  
Some governments have codified and adopted national vocational qualifications  
\(see Figure 15.5\) and occupational standards for the event industry to facili-  
tate recognizable and attainable career paths. The United Nations Educational,  
Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Centre for Technical  
and Vocational Training and Education \(UNESCO-UNEVOC\) contends that a  
national qualifications framework \(NQF\) can provide improvement of employ-  
ment prospects through training and education, as well as help to create parity of Professional Endurance

esteem between vocational and academic qualifications. Note\: If you are a seasoned  
event professional, you may wish to become involved with these organizations as an  
industry advisor, consultant, educator, or provider of workplace internships.  
Occupational standards will form the basis for standardized academic curricula,  
and they will likely eventually be adopted by governments throughout the world as  
- the basis for legislation and enforceable regulations with which they can pro-  
tect the public health and safety. Such standards include the globally harmonized  
Event Management International Competency Standards \(EMICS\) developed by  
the Canadian Tourism Human Resource Council \(CTHRC 2010, 1\)\:  
\[These standards\] have been developed in cooperation with industry partici-  
pants from 20 countries. The Standards contain a comprehensive summary of the 442  
Sustainable Success  
functions, tasks and competencies required to work in event management. They  
describe in detail the skills, knowledge and attitudes that employers and clients are  
looking for when obtaining professional sérvices to plan, implement and evaluate  
different types of events in Canada and internationally.  
Certification programs are offered by various event industry sectors to provide the  
external validation and demonstrable indication that one has the knowledge, train-  
ing, experience, judgment, and ability—the qualifications—to be a practitioner in  
a particular field. Certification is becoming a baseline expectation of discriminating  
clients, and clients are becoming more discriminating every day \(see Figure 15.6\).

Various Event Industry

Embrace Lifelong Learning  
One of the key components of the various certification programs offered is the  
requisite of and commitment to continuing education and professional development.  
True professionals recognize that exploration, study, research, and investigation  
are an integral part of their duties. You must be hungry for knowledge, constantly  
seeking out more in-depth understanding of all the current and emerging tech-  
nologies, applications, and implications pertaining to this multifaceted industry.  
Cultivate the joy of lifelong learning. Lifelong learning encompasses theoretical  
study and practical experience, as well as gleaning knowledge from every corner  
of the world around you.  
Take advantage of the continuing education and professional development  
programs and opportunities offered by academic institutions \(universities, com-  
munity colleges, and vocational or continuing education programs\), profes-  
sional associations, and other organizations. These need not be specific to the  
event industry; everything you learn can be applied to your endeavors in pro-  
fessional event coordination. Take classes in computer systems, financial man-  
agement, leadership, time management, psychology, writing, public speaking,  
flower arranging, cooking—anything that piques your interest. Also seek out  
event industry-related courses in administration, design, coordination, sales and  
marketing, risk management, CPR/first aid, project management, travel and  
tourism, entertainment, adult learning principles, fundraising, and the indi-  
vidual event genres.  
Read everything you can get your hands on. Invest in your future by subscribing  
to industry and nonindustry magazines, newsletters, and newspapers. Subscribe to  
RSS feeds from industry-related and subject-specific blogs, publications, and other  
syndicated material. Read every book and publication you can on every event  
genre and the event industry. Purchase them, borrow them from a lending library,  
or spend a few glorious hours reading them in an academic research library. See  
everything you can see. Attend the theater and concerts. Go to the movies or rent  
films and watch them at home. Search out informative programming on television.  
Participate in events in and for your community. Volunteer your time and talents  
for events for charitable, political, or other organizations you support. Attend  
the events held in your community as well as those you encounter in your travels.  
You will collect hundreds of ideas and note hundreds of precautions to apply  
to your future events.  
Connect with the Professional Community  
You must also develop relationships with the others in your professional commu-  
nity. It has been said that we are all separated from any other person on the planet  
by six personal connections. The same might be said for career development; you 444  
Sustainable Success  
might be six “personal contacts” away from your next job. You should take advan-  
tage of social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and others. Join and par-  
ticipate in industry-specific and special interest group listservs \(subscriber-based  
automated e-mail distribution systems\) that can be found on Google, Yahoo!,  
and the like. Create your own Web site and/or blog. Develop your personal  
brand—self-positioning your abilities and unique qualifications in a way that can  
be quickly communicated in casual, professional, and electronic situations. For  
example, can you effectively explain who you are and what you do \(or want to do\)  
to someone you meet while in an elevator?  
When asked what advice they would give to those who would read this book,  
most of the people I interviewed recommended that you join a professional asso-  
ciation in the industry, go to the meetings, and become involved. This is where  
you will meet the people who will help you to continually improve your abilities  
and connect with the resources or employment opportunities you will need. This  
is also where you can become an active participant in shaping the future of this  
industry, this profession.

Wrap Up  
Sustainability is the ability to continue, for both current and future generations.  
It encompasses social, economic, and environmental responsibilities to safeguard  
and improve the human and ecological systems and resources used in our endeay-  
ors. This triple bottom line approach is being adopted throughout the world  
by those who produce, those who authorize, and those who attend events of all  
types. Strategies and tactics to preserve, protect, and nurture existing resources  
should be incorporated into our event plans and integrated throughout our event  
operations.  
An event is an experience, one that is caretully crafted by bringing together a  
broad spectrum of goods, services, and the people who provide them in a spe-  
cific space and at a specific time. This event experience carries multiple mean-  
ings and varying levels of importance for those in attendance and those hosting  
it. For the professional event coordinator and all those people brought together  
to stage it, it carries with it awesome responsibilities. These responsibilities are  
not to be undertaken lightly; they must be embraced with a diligent zeal for  
excellence.  
As you travel through your career in professional event coordination, you must  
always be a seeker as well as a giver. Seek out the people, education, and tech-  
nologies that will help you get better and better at what you do. Give of yourself  
to others in this industry and those who are preparing to enter it. Give to your-  
self by investing your time and money in continuing education and professional  
development, as well as certification. And make the commitment to always bring  
honor, integrity, and innovation to the profession.
