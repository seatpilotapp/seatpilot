# Introduction  
**Who will help me find my way?**  
The term "wayfaring" bas been In the Englisb language since the  
16tb century. •way-finding" was flTSt used by tbe American arcbi·  
tect Kevin Lyocb In his lnfiueotlal book, *The Image of the Oit11*  
The *Shorter Oxford Engl/sh Dictionary*  
*\(SOED\)* hos the following definitions for  
**analogous words\:**  
\(1960\).'  
Although early in his book Lynch used the term "way-finding  
***Make one's way ,.* To travel or proceed in an**  
**Intended direction or to a certain place.**  
**devices"' to describe maps, street numbers, route signs, and so on,**  
**his work is based on the concept of .. spatial orientation" and its**  
**prerequisite, the cognitive map or. as be cal.ls it, the image.**  
*Wayfarer* \(1440\), A traveller by road.  
**especially one who traveis on foot.**  
We must credit bim as the first person to recognize the impor·  
lance or "imaging" to people f10ding their way. An environmental  
image, be wrote, is the generalized mental representation of the  
external physical world that every individual tries to form. It is the  
***Wayfaring* \(1836\), Travelling or journeying**  
**by road, usually *a wayfaring man,* a traveller**  
by road \(Isa. 35\:8\).  
product or immediate sensation *plus* the memory of past experi·  
eoce, both or which combine to interpret information and guide  
action.  
Perhaps the best known and certainly most quoted part or  
Lynch's book is his analysis or the city in terms or Its elements.  
These be called paths, edges, landmarks. nodes, and districts.  
These are terms tbat continue to be used lo wayflodlng design and  
theory today.  
Lynch had a major lofiueoce on research during the 60s wblch  
abounded lo Investigations Into city Images. Unfortunately, they  
had no Immediate lofiuence on "slgoage and graphics" and very  
little on architecture. It was In the early 70s tbat an Important  
conceptual shift occurred. Cognitivists, such as Steven Kaplan.'  
Roger Downs, and David Stea.' argued that In order to understand  
what people do and how they find their way, one has to understand  
the underlying process. Xbe relevant concept was, therefore, no  
**longer '"spatial orientation" but a new notion incorporating all the**  
**perceptual, cognitive, and decision· making processes necessary to**  
find one's way. This new con cept was baptized "wayf10ding. •  
Over twenty years separste Lynch's book from the pubUcation  
of *Wa11finding in Architecture* in 1984 by my co-author, Romedi  
Passini.• He presented the design profession with the first global  
conceptuallzalion of wayfloding based on empirical data, and he  
ldentllled major difficulties people bad with architecture and  
slgn8gll when finding tbeir way lo complex urban settings.  
He also showed that spatial orientation and wayflodlng have  
fascinated people througb the ages and that this fascination has  
round expression In art and folklore. Most Important however, be  
showed lbal wayfloding was a key design Issue and could no longer  
be ignored.  
It is lair to say that while tbe notion of wayfinding is now  
accepted by many people, it has not yet made its luU impact on the  
design profession. This boo\)\<4 an attemt t to bring this about.

vUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN The roles that are currently fulfilled by architects and graphic  
designers are still hostages to the status quo - to that outworn but  
still prevailing notion that arehitects design buildings, while  
graphic designers come along at the end or the building process  
and install some signs. and that the public is somehow helped by  
this. It is admiltedly dlflicult to break out ol this straitjacket, but it  
is Important that we do so.  
Society no longer tolerates the Idea that people's inability to  
find their way around in the built environment is either trivial or  
unimportant. Moreover. there ls ample evidence that society is now  
prepared to satisfy the demands or the disabled by making public  
and commercial faclllties more accessible to them.  
There Is. therefore. an urgent need lor us to escape lrom the  
cyranny of the status quo and to explore new approaches to coping  
with these very real but, until recently, largely unacknowledged  
problems.  
It is the authors' fervent wish that the exampl e of this book will  
create the matrix through which a new proresaion, Waylinding  
Design, can begin to emerge - one that will i . ndced extend the  
boundaries or profcsaional practice in both the arehitectural and  
# the design professions.

**The nature of wayfinding difficulties**  
The emergence of wayllndlng dllllcultlee, one may tbJnk, Is **a**  
recent phenomenon brougbt on by the complexity of contempo-  
nuy buUdlngs and clUes. Nobody can deny that these dllllcul-  
tlee are exacerbated In today's urban setU,.gs, but a UtUe bit  
of digging shows clearly tbat dlfflcultlee with knowing wbere  
one Is, where to go, and bow to get there, aU go beck a very  
lo,.g way. An anthropologlcal view of the labyrinth - wblcb Is  
both the artifact and tbe symbol of being disoriented and lost -  
brl,.gs to Ugbt **a** preoccupation with this s ubject wblcb Is as  
**old as b11manklnd.**  
In tbl.s chapter we Introduce tbe nature of contemponuy  
wayllndlng dllllcultlee. There are so many of them that even  
making **a** represeutatlve choice Is dUllcult.

You, the reader, may just scan tbrougb this chapter to get an over-  
all picture of what the difficulties are. Each issue will be looked at  
in detail later on in the book.  
Put yourself in a travel mood - you are going for an imaginary  
journey. In fact, you are already in a foreign city, and you have to  
catch a train. You are in a bit of a hurry.  
Is lb.ls the railway station?  
You look at a building and wonder whether It is a railway station or  
a supermarket or the head olfice or an insurance company. You  
have ten minutes before the train leaves.  
Wbere Is the entrance?  
You have to search !or the entrance to the parking lot, and then  
you have to search !or the entrance of the building.  
*You have seven minutes ten.*  
The layout appears to be a labyrtnth.  
Once inside, you cannot figure out the layout. You don't understand  
bow the spaces relate to each other, nor can you Identify any  
underlying orgenlzalional principle. The cireulation sYBtem ,....  
mains a mystery to you.  
You cannot locale youraell In the station.  
You know you are somewhere in it, but where? Everything around  
you tends to look similar. For all you know, you may even have  
been at that same spot just a minute ago.  
Wbere are the elevaton?  
You try one corridor, then another.  
*Now you have !Ive mtnutes ten.*  
You may bave mlued a sign.  
You wonder if there was a sign or a map which could have been or  
help but which you, In your hurry, just overlooked.  
Thee you - **a** sign or a directory, but It Is bard to read.  
The lettering le too email, the contrast with the background poor. It  
is not well illuminated and the little light there le, comes bouncing  
back at you as if it had bit a mirror.  
There is too much information on the sign. It is chunked to-  
gether or scattered so that you can't read it. You see an electronic.  
cban8eable-mee""i'l sign but it moves too rapidly.  
*Three mt1Wlls ten.*  
You - **a** map but It la lfleelble.  
Looking at the map display, you get contused. It shows too many  
things and not what you tblnk you need. It somehow does not seem  
to represent the space you are In. It seems that It Is not aligned  
with the setting.

1.2 **Who Is Inept at wayflndlng?**  
W eU, to start of!, In many settings users do not pay eoougb atten-  
lion lo the in!ormaUon available. Olten they may be looking at  
Information without actu&Uy seeing it, and not very much can be  
done about that. On the other hand, they tend also to be !orget!ul.  
II, !or example, they are given a description or how to reach a  
destination, they may no! retain ii !or very long. People tend not lo  
**understand, or to mix up, the meaning of the most rudimentary**  
pictographs, and many fmd that maps are quite useless lo them.  
Many fail to understand architectural layou!B.  
**While all this is true, it is also true that these are the reasons**  
given 10 excuse what ls nothing more than poor design. Picto-  
graphs are not necessarily confusing and maps not necessarily  
useless. There ls such a thing as architectural space that people  
can understand.  
The bollom line is, and bas to be, the user, and not a super-  
user either, but a representative of the population al large. Archi-  
tec!B and designers have to plan for the roal world.  
II II appears !hat users don 'I pay eoougb a!lenlloo to the Infor-  
mation provided, It may be an Indication that the Information ls  
badly placed. II they look at Information without seeing It, the  
graphic presentation may weU be at fault. Mess\~ may not be  
retained because they are too long or are poorly structured.  
Pictographs may be misread because Ibey are not sell-explana-  
tory or because they have not been around !or a su!llcieot length of  
time to be learned. Maps may be too complex; sometimes they may  
not even be allgoed with the surrounding setting.  
Architectural layou!B may not be underslood because Ibey are  
amorphous or because the architectural language is garbled.  
The only way to approach wayfmdlng issues intelli&'lJlllY is !or  
architects and designers lo pay attention to bow people perceive  
and understand the environment, bow they situate themselves in  
space, and bow they use Information in the decision-making and  
decision-executing processes.  
But then, of course, to do Ibis intelligently, architects and  
designers must first know what way!lndlng Is.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 2.1 Frustration and stress  
The frustrations and stresses we are subjected to In just getting  
around the built environment are bad enougb In themselves with·  
out having to put up with getting lost in it as well.  
We don·t build "understandable" cities and, as a N!Sult, being  
lost in them \(particularly in places with which we are unfamiliar\) is  
just something we feel we have to put up with - like being stuck in  
traffic jams. breathing noxious emissions. sharing the roads with  
drunks and the sidewalks with mugg\<lrll.  
But, because all of these latter conditions can actually result in  
bodily harm or death. whereas it is unlikely !bat a person will  
actually die from the stress of &"!ling lost, we have tended to  
**People have been known to die because**  
**ambulance driwrs could not find their way**  
**to an address in time.**  
downgrade this problem as being relatively unimportant.  
Most eflorts to cope with the issue of people·s &"tling lost. and  
to prevent them from &"!ling lost. have relied on pulling up signs.  
It was well known and faltly universally acknowledged that  
putting up signs was one of those efforts that somehow bad to be  
complied with, but the rewards for which could, on occasion, be  
doubtlul. People could oneo be as lost with the signs as they were  
without them and for a variety of reasons\:  
• The signs were there, but people could not see them because  
they were too small.  
• The sign was big eoougb for its message to be seen, but it made  
no sense; people could see it, but not read or understand ii.  
• Because the signs were poorly located, people could not find  
them.  
• Because people expected the signs to be unreliable \(even if, in  
fact. they were no such thing\), they ignored them. preferring to  
ask questions Instead.  
On the other band, from the viewpoint of the people who paid  
for and installed these signs in their buildings, !be feeling oneo  
was that !be public actually enjoyed getting 1081, or that the public  
was being deliberately perverse or stupid.  
We are now at a point where we migbt well wonder - as we are  
doing in this book - whether all those difficulties that people have  
with signs indicate that signs alone are not the answer, whether  
there Is not a better way.  
They are obviously not the answer to people's getting lost *ii*  
they are Illegible or unreadable or unreliably placed. But even *ii*  
the signs In a building bad none of these faUlngs. the burden of  
helping people find their way to their destinations le shared by  
architects In the way Ibey plan and design spaces and In the way  
Ibey provide for the use of such spaces.

with a particular environment not understanding why everyone  
else, e.·en strangers, should not be equally knowledgeable about It.  
The sllgbUy aggressive tone In the clerk's reoponse lndlcates, or  
course, her own !rust ration at being constanUy Interrupted by the  
public asking •stupid" questions.  
Another occasion I vividly remember Is my personal reaction to  
my lnabllity *to* find my way to a client's office. He gave the address  
and told me that be was on the 8th Door In the building. Both or  
these !acts I had carelully noted down.  
When my colleague and I arrived on the appointed day at what  
we thought was the rlgbt building, we were dlstre88ed to find that  
his name did not appear on the directory In the lobby. Our immedi·  
ate conclusloo was that I had copied down the address lncorrcctly.  
Our second was to assume that maybe tile building dlrectory was  
out of date and that all "'OU.Id still be well once we got to the 8th  
Door. On arrival there. however, we found that the entire Door was  
occupied by a single tenant whose name bore no relation whatso-  
**ever to that or our client.**  
At this point we automatically reverted to our Initial reaction In  
the main lobby and were roundly blaming ourselves for getting it  
all wrong when the receptionist peered up and spoke my name-  
**with. of course a rise in cadence at the end. So, ..ve were at the**  
right place alter all!  
It turned out that our client rented space lrom the tenant who  
had the whole Door and, as so often happens, was prohibited by the  
owners from having his name as a sul\>-tenant appear either on the  
building directory or on the 8th Door.  
Our next reaction, Instead or relier, was resentment. Having  
thoroughly blamed ourselves !or what turned out to be no reason  
\(we hadn't got It all wrong after all\), "'ll greatly resented having  
been put In such a position, and I know that I entered bis office In a  
decidedly bad mood.  
Assuming that people commonly have similar experiences, It is  
uselul to summarize the chain of emotional reactions they are  
subject to\:  
• First, you blame yourself.  
• Not only do you !eel stupid, but you are frustrated bec&use you  
are lost, and anxious that you might be late or miss your ap-  
pointment altogether.  
• **When you discover that you a.re neither stupid, nor lost, nor late.**  
you feel resentment, possibly anger. that somethlng so seem-  
ingly simple and inconsequential should be made so damnably  
difficult.

2.2 Functional lneHlclency  
It Is probably not enough to make a case !or reducing people's  
wayfindlng problems simply on the basis of such unquantifiable  
aspects of everyday life 8ll lrustrallon and stress. We now turn our  
attention, therefore, to quantifiable reasons for reducing the  
chances or people's wandering aimlessly about public and private  
lacilities - and getting lost ln the process. The obverse of the  
**Onginal from**  
8 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN getting-108!-and-!eeling-helpless coin is anger which manifests  
**itself in a variety of ways including vandalism.**  
Janet Carpman, well known as co-author o! the admirable book  
*Design That Cares,* has pointed out that the single thing the public  
most dreads about hospitals and health-care facilities is getting  
**lost in them.** 1  
Hospitals rely heavily on the public !or their financial support.  
They must be aware that one o! the ways the public expresses its  
disapproval is to withhold support. \(It is !or Ibis reason that so  
many attempts to "improve the signage• In a hospital originate In  
the public relations department.\)  
It is well known also that our feelings about a shopping mall or  
other such commerclal !acWty are colored In large measure by how  
well or how easily we get around In it. Can we park and unpark  
with a minimum of hassle? Is there a logic to theiayout of the place  
which makes shopping or parking there a pleasure - or Is It som&-  
tbing else?  
Proprietors of department stores used to design around the  
concept or actually confusing shoppers on the assumption that ii  
they could keep people on the premises longer, they would buy  
more merebandise. The !act that there are rarely, if ever, clocks in  
shopping malls is based on the same assumption. But these ideas  
are now largely regarded as old fashioned and counter productive.  
Developers today are discovering that good wayfmding practice is  
a positive marketing benefit.  
There was a time not long ago when the "e!liciency" of an office  
building \(and therefore the rents that could be charged !or space in  
**it\) was measured exclusively in terms of its location, the speed of**  
the elevators, how last their doors closed or opened, and other  
functional considerations. In recent years, the concept bas dawned  
on developers that adequate wayfinding provisions are another  
**criterion for evaluating rental costs.**  
It stands to reason that a building owner has an undenlable  
edge on bis competitors ii he can say to prospective tenants that  
their clients wW not have to suffer from lost time In wandering  
about getting lost, trying to park, or missing their appointments,  
because he bas Incorporated the wayflnding component Into his  
building. The prospect of added profits ls a wonderful mot1"ator,  
and references to the "wayflnding component" can be expected to  
play an Increasingly important role In commcreial real-estate  
advertising In the future.  
**Recent hospital research demonstrated that**  
**in a facility of some 800 beds. no less than**  
**8000 hours of professional time are lost in**  
**redirecting patients and visitors to their**  
**destinations.. Thi. s is exdusive of the time**  
**that the professionals themselves lose In**  
**trying to find their way about, particularly**  
**when they are new on the job. Nor does it**  
**refer to the hidden costs that result from**  
**delayed professional Interventions which**  
**may critically affect patients.**  
**Now, as e\:very administrator knows, 8000**  
**hours of** prof\~ional **time represents at least**  
**four person.years - with all that that implies.**  
# 2.3 Accessibility  
The term "accesslbWty" has become synonymous with barrier-free  
design and evokes images or wheelchairs and ramps. or course  
there Is much more to barrier-free design than ramps. Doors, !or  
example, can be too heavy to be opened by a person In a wheel·  
chair, ramps can be too steep, elevator buttons too high, spaces too  
narrow to tum around in. One could easUy fill a page with archite\<\>  
tural barriers encountered by wheelchair users and people with  
other physical disabUities.G **l**

The lmpKt of w•yfinding difficulties  
2.SAccealbWty  
These physical architectural barriers are by now weU identified  
in the literature ol architecture and the solutions to overeome them  
have been translated into design guidelines and supportive \~el&·  
!ion. The resu!IB are starting to show in our cities and buildings.  
The built environment iB responsible not only !or physical but  
also !or psychological barriers. These also affect accessibility but  
they are much less known. The !ear of being robbed or assaulted  
can make parts or certain cities virtually inaccessible to large  
sections ol tbe population. The same applies to buildings. Many  
people rear underground parking\~ to the point where they  
prefer risking heavy lines by parking illegally in the street.  
Quite apart from the fear ol goitting lost or of being mugged,  
wayf111ding problems posed by certain buildings may be just too  
much for sections or the population to cope with. For them the  
problem or waylinding may be insoluble within acceptable limllB of  
risk and energy investment.  
Research and personal observation show that waylinding  
dllficultles are magnllied tor the handicapped population. Wheel·  
chair users often have to take tortuous routes and use alternative  
\(and less convenient\) accesaes. Users with a sensory handicap  
have dllficuJtles obtaining relevant lnlormatlon. What may be a  
surmountable wayllnding dllficulty !or the able-bodied user may  
become an Impossibility !or one who Is handicapped. A recent  
survey \(Romedl Passini\) demonstrated that luUy 90 percent of the  
bllnd people in Montreal consider public buildlngs to be iniux\:essi·  
ble because of dllficultles associated with waylindlng.  
AU of this, we believe, shows clearly enough that waylindlng  
problems constitute an Important arcbltectural barrier allecting  
sizable numbers of people.

*2.4* Safety  
People who get Into buildings also have to goit out ol them - some-  
times last. As settings grow larger and more complex, emergoincy  
evacuation becomes a key problem, and wayf111ding becomes a  
matter or life and death.  
There is a large body of recent research on bow people behave  
when confronted with the dangoirs of fire and other e mergoincies.  
Two areas link this issue to waylindlng\: the design and signagoi of  
exit routes and the goineral quality of waylinding design or a set·  
ting.  
The design and slgnagoi or exit routes are complex Issues. We  
shall see later on \(sections 7.2.3 and 11.2.2\) that the notion or a  
specillc emergoincy exit, used only In situations or dangoir, should  
be seriously questioned. Requirements !or exit routes are regu·  
lated by national llre-oodes, but certain aspects or the codes,  
unfortunately, do not accord with recent research llndlogs.  
A setting Is safer II It ls wcU understood by the users and II they  
can easUy goet around In It. Should an exit be barred by fire or  
smoke, the users will generally be able to figure out alternative  
routes In buildings they know. Nonetheless, the literature shows  
that people have perished in lro11t ol conl!llsted emergency exits  
Ong1na1 frarn  
10 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN during a lire wben, ln !act, an alternative exit could have been  
used.  
Increased acooss to hulldlngs for tbe handicapped population  
poses additional questions about safety. How, for example, Is a  
user of a whoolchair evacuated fl'Om a blgb·rlse? What is tbe  
warning signal o! a lire for a deaf person? How does a blind person  
find bis or her way out? These are only some of the i88ues we shall  
have to deal with.  
To sum up, wayfinding design bas a major impact on all users  
of the built environment\:  
• It alfeets tbelr emotional state, Including thelr feelings about tbe  
setthlg and its tenants \(as well as about those who own It\).  
• It bas a functional impact whlc.b Is measurable In terms or  
ertlciency and monetary value.  
• It Involves acoeeslbWty and public safety.  
Can anyone still doubt Its Importance?

**Standing in the way of wayfinding solutions**  
Having brielly reremid to some or tbe lmpecta or waytlndlng  
problems In the previous chapter, bere we attempt to uncover  
some or the reasons why wayflndlng bas been neglected or  
Ignored for so long.  
Two of the basic stumbling blocks to a solution are I\) that  
our society does not yet care enough, and 2\) that archltecta  
have been too Intent on the nlcelles of architectural design  
wblle graphic designers have been too Intent on those or ty·  
pography and on not offending tbe architects to care eltber.  
**But attitudes can change.**

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 3.1 Societal values  
Indifference is the only thing tbat will explain why II ls tbat, or all  
the clements that go into tbe design and construction or a buUding  
complex. the waylinding component bas, in the past, been at the  
very bottom or the list.  
Building standards apparently vary widely throughout the  
world \(as recent earthquakes In pliwes such as Armenia and  
Mexico bave demonstrated\). In the so-called developed world,  
however, and particularly in Nortb America, Europe, and parts ol  
Southeast Asia, Ibey are reasonably consistent. They are consist·  
ent in the expectations, !or instance, that the building will not ran  
down and that the plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems  
will all !unction properly. As a result, ii is safe lo say lbal ii is quite  
*1mpossible* lor a building to be erected today in which lbe devel·  
oper and that small army of consullants who have advised him  
should "lorget" to include washrooms, or lighting. or air condition·  
Ing. just to name some of the elements that are regarded as esaen-  
llal.  
The various Industries that serve the construction business are  
constantly overhauling, modllylng, and improving their products.  
The equipping or a modern office buUding complex today Is vastly  
Improved In function, In esthetlcs, and In cost elfecllveness over  
what was Installed In a comparabl e buUding only a decade or so  
ago.  
Thls dedlcatlon to functional Improvement Is what makes II all  
tbe more difficult to understand why the wayllndlng component  
has been so systematically "forgotten· In the planning of so many  
of our universities, hospitals, and transportation facilities.  
Nor is it as though the persons Involved in constructing and  
financing these facilities are unaware that frequently people have  
the greatest difficulty trying to make efficient use of them.  
Everybody knows, and has known all along, that wayfmding  
problems exist. Everybody knows it and everybody deplores It.  
That, however, is not a solution. It is the attitude lbal counts and  
this altitude has been tbal ii has always been this way, that we  
must put up with it, and that nothing really awful ever happened to  
anyone by merely getting lost on the way to wherever he or she  
was going.  
Jndillerence, like so many other things, however, is subject to  
tbe Inevitable erosions of time. Think, for example, of tbe extraor-  
dinarUy small time span that separates us today In our relatively  
smoke-free environments from the days when everybody seemed to  
be smoking cigarettes - most of tbe time.  
This represents a total turnabout by the public on the one band  
\(in supporting smoke-free environments\), and, on the other, by the  
owners and operators ol these liwililies \(!or providing them\).  
In other words, what was until recently considered unimpor-  
lanl is now regarded as very important. The penny drops and we  
all wcnder why we put up with such·and·such !or so Jong. One day  
ii will be waylinding's turn and the same thing will happen. Voices  
now being raised in prolesyat.tbe stalu\~o will prevail and

3.1 Societal values  
society will enthusiastically espouse a cause !hat only a lew years  
previously was not thougbl ol as having any real Importance.  
There is an interesting and relevant relationship between the  
slgnage component in waylinding and public art. Both cost about  
the same. Or should. But whereas the one percent lor public art is  
well established and bas been lor a long time, the same amount lor  
waylinding is not and never has been.  
Art. ol course, serves as a soltenlng and bumanlzlng lnDuence  
on public opinion. It Is b.lghly visible and gets a lot ol coverage lrom  
the art critics ln the Sunday newspapers. Moreover, a perlectly  
outrageous \(or just plain ordinary\) building can be rendered pub-  
llcly more acceptable because ol the amount or money spent on  
publlc art ln or around It. *AiJ* a result, hardly a commeroial building  
today Is without its contribution to pubUe art. And a lot of it can be  
bought at one percent or, say, 50 to 100 million dollars.  
It Is a sign of the times that whereas the one percent lor public  
art bas *de facto* recognition just about everywhere in Canada and  
the United States, the same amount \(or even less\) is considered  
scandalously extravagant if applied to satisfying the graphic  
aspect of wayfinding needs.  
This is not an argument against exposing the public to art in  
public spaoos. It *is* an argument, however, in support of balance  
and priorities. It is quite extraordinary, when one stops to think  
about it, where our priorities lie, and that art should be considered  
**essential when sign.age is not.**  
But then the idea that excellence in wayfmding can do a devel-  
oper just aa much good in the public eye as a.rt can, is still in its  
inlancy.  
Clouding and confusing the issue. ol course, Is the lact that  
"art," through carelul manipulation. has become so firmly en-  
trenched in establishment thinking that nothlng that is *not* art can  
be considered seriously. Many archltects have cast themselves ln  
the role ol artists, witlle sign.age design.ere \(with their brass letters  
on stainless steel raoos\) are also anxious to be considered as  
artists. *AiJ* a result, anything so mundane as helping people find  
their way about these environments in a practical manner is rarely  
considered  
N ot yet anyway.  
Digitized by **Google**  
The trouble is that we don't care enough about wayfinding \(let  
alone signs\) to Insist on doing the job properly. This is why plan-  
ning for wayfindit1g is all too inrrequently anybody's concern when  
a building complex i s in the design stages.  
But wayfinding is not only something that takes place inside  
buildings. First of all we have to find our way to these buildings,  
**and here the situation, in North America at least, is just as bad.**

reliable, consistently plsood *identification of* street names, places  
**of interest, civic and municipal offices, and so on.**  
'!be signage in Avignon is complemented by the design of the  
city streets, by the banning ol vehicular traffic from some of them,  
by the use or handsome bollards, to actually prevent cars lrom  
parking, rather than no-parking signs which would Utter the  
slreetscape, and by the absence ol parking meters, at least in the  
**North American sense.**  
Instead or parking meters, there is a machine, say every hun-  
dred meters, against the wall of a building \(slreets are narrow,  
sidewalks even narrower\), which dispenses parking tickets. Coins  
are inserted, a stamped ticket for a given period of time is issued.  
This is placed, lace up, on the motorist's dashboard for inspection  
by the police. The day wtll surely come when North American cities  
care enough to adopt Avignon's alternative to the parking meter.  
**Two anecdotes by Romedi Passini.**  
Digitized by **Google** 16  
A lew years ago an architect lriend. who was working with a large  
citizen group in Montreal. asked his audienoe what they considered  
to be the worsl building in the city. He hoped it would not be one of  
his but rather one of his competitors'. He was lucky, but totally  
amazed by the response or his audience. Everybody seemed to  
agree that the worst building in Montreal was a recent commercial  
center which had been published in respected architectural Jour-  
nals and which was generally held In high esteem by the proles-  
slon.  
This commerclal center was archltecturally quite appealing. It  
was constructed In a series of Interior terraces with a number of  
stairs coMectlng levels at dlllerent heigllts. It had many Interest-  
ing views and a contemporary architectural look to it. Compan?d to  
**other commercial centers, it certainly was of superior esthetie**  
quality.  
Why was it the worst building, my lriend asked in surprise?  
lkcause, they said, it is almost impossible to ftnd your way around  
in it. My lriend was stunned. He had never thought about way-  
fmding when designing *his* buildings either.  
This is not the end or the story. The center turned out not to be  
a commercial suocess. The shopping turnover never reached the  
planned levels and many people refused even to enter the building.  
In order to save the venture, the management decided to Invest  
In a massive "slgnage" project. Directional signs were carelully  
conceived and placed, maps or the settings were produced in  
various sizes. and even more, supergraphies and color coding were  
**used to identify the Doors and the major circulation pattern. No one**  
could quibble about the graphic design.  
In addition. the place looked even better. '!be redesign was  
lollowed by a publicity campaign, which had as leitmotiv\: "Come  
visit us, it's so easy to ftnd yqur way about." Did It work? No, it did  
**not.**  
**Original from**  
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN . The various split-levels, the confusing spatial organization, the  
ambiguous circulation pattern, the repetitive architectural lea·  
**tures, the contradictory articulation of the interior and the exterior**  
- none of these factors could be solved by graphica. The problem  
was clearly arehitectural. The building was eventually lorn down.  
A press release mentioned that the building was found to be impos·  
sible for wayfmdJng purpcses.  
Here ill another example. During a reoonl visit to the University  
of Stuttgart, I was invited to give a lecture on wayfinding to the  
university's departmenl of planning. I was warned that I would  
probably not be able to nod my way, and took this as one of those  
jokes I had heard before. But it was not a Joke. I had to call for  
help.  
The uolverslty ls housed in a large, modernist complex with a  
great number ol entraoees. all looking about equally Important or.  
what ls closer to the truth, equally unimportant, and there Is no  
apparent logic to the layout.  
I bad been given a complicated eode, which described the  
address of my destination. but although I observed the use of  
colors on the !\~es. I stlll could make no sense of this informa-  
tion. Later. In discussion with my host, I was told a familiar story.  
After the bulldlngwas completed, It was discovered that students  
and stall were having dllflculties getting around, so it was decided  
to improve the signage.  
The graphic designer did his best. He tried to impose order  
with a color code where no architectural order was to be found. Hill  
**imposed system, however. was far from obvious and it became very**  
complex. Of course, it didn't do much good and he was naturally  
blamed for the fiasco. The fault, however, lay entirely with the  
architect.  
Architects, one would think, would be very keen to learn about  
wayfwding. Our experience up to now bas been to the contrary. It  
is stlll dilficult to get practising architects to Interest themselves in,  
or to read about, wayUndlng or to attract them *to* conferences. As  
we have already noted, it ls virtually Impossible to get wayflndlng  
courses Into the architectural education system.  
There must be many reasons for this apathy. Architects may  
feel, for example, that they already have too much to think about  
and do not want to be burdened with additlonal requirements.  
They may just be badly Informed, or the Information they have may  
not be presented In a form suitable for their use. Perhaps, however,  
it is *we* who are too impatient, perhaps we ought to allow more  
time for the message to get through.  
In this book we try to present not only individual recommends·  
lions but a wayfmding design approach. The internal coherence of  
this approach, we feel, will aciually make life easier for architects.  
We also hope to convince them that wayfwding is a key issue and  
not a peripheral one, and that wayfwdlng design is far from being  
an exclusively graphic design function.  
**A prime motive for writing this book has**  
**been the authors' keen desire to demon-**  
**strate that wayfinding, unlike s ignage. has**  
**more to it than graphic design - important**  
**as that may be. What used to be regarded,**  
**by architects, building owners. and graphic**  
**designers, as a purely graphic issue is now**  
**gradually coming to be seen as both an**  
**architectural and a graphk issue requiring**  
**close collaboration by the two disciplines.**  
**We are also beginning to see that this team**  
**\(architect and graphic designer\) will have to**  
**have at least a grasp of the fundamentals of**  
**environmental perception and cognition and**  
**of the principles of wayfinding.**  
**In addition. the team will need to recognize**  
**that wayfinding usually involves all of the**  
**senses - and not just one.**  
**Where are such people to be found7 And,**  
**more importantly, who will prepare them**  
**for this vocation? Who will do the teaching.**  
**and where?**

don Underground \(despite the "politeness· ol Its graphics\) and the  
Paris Metro \(another excellent wayfindlng system, despite the total  
anonymity of *its* graphics\) both rely for their success on more than  
just typography and graphic design. Just as Important, II not more  
so, are the contributions of the architeets and transportation  
planners who laid out the concourses and other spaces that give  
**access to the mazes or tunnels and corridors, which work so well,**  
so seemingly effortlessly, in getting us to the right platform.  
**There is no end in sight to the manner in which "visual compo-**

should there be. although it would be pleasant, once in a while, to  
**come a.cross one whose professional interest in design extends to**  
**an interesl in content as well. It should. however, come to an**  
abrupt end when these same designers turn to signage.  
Unfortunately too many of us still think that the principles that  
have worked so well and been acclaimed in the area of print will be  
equally successful in that of signage. *AB* a result, we are now being  
Increasingly exposed to the robust, assertive, and vigorous use of  
such things as brass letters on stainless steel backgrounds or of  
wblte or charooa.l letlers on brushed \(or satin or, heaven presen·e  
us, mirror-finished\) aluminum.  
It will require a major change of mindset and of attitude on the

Principles of wayfinding Chapter 4  
**What are spatial orientation and wayfinding?**  
In the literature on spatial behavior, wayflndlng la **a** new-  
comer. Introduced In the late 70s, It replaced the term "spatial  
orientation." Wayflndlng Is not Just a new and, we have to  
admit, now quite la.sblonable term for an old concept. It re-  
Oects a new approach to studying people's movements and  
their relatlonsblp to space. Even more Importantly, tbla new  
approach opens up new ways to design for people's spatial  
behavior.'  
In this chapter we sketch a brief research blatory and  
Introduce the basic concepts of spatial orientation, cognitive  
maps, and wayllndlng.

**Original from**  
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 4.1 Spatial orlentaUon\: the static relaUonshlp to space  
**The oldest mentions of spatial orientation, the forerunner of**  
wayfwding, appeared in neuropsycbological literature over a  
century ago. Neuropsychologists, such as Forster in t890, Meyer in  
1900, and Holmes in 1918, reported case studies of patients who, as  
victims of brain lesions, were incapable of even the most elemen·  
tary uoderstanding of where they were and of bow to reach given  
destinations in their everyday environment.•  
The deficiencies leading to these conditions of disorientation  
were later Identified as topographical or spatial agnosla and  
topographical or spatial anwesia. The key manifestation of spatial  
agnosla ls an lnablllty to l'l!COgnize spaces visited on previous  
occasions, wblle spatial anwesla leads to an lnablllty to link spaces  
mentally Into an overall representation.•  
Thls representation people have or their surrounding environ-  
ment, also called an Image or a cognitive map, ls the psychological  
concept that underlies the notion or spatial orientation. A cognitive  
map ls a mental construct or an environment which cannot be seen  
from one slngle vantage point alone. It bas to be composed from a  
series or Individual vistas. Cognitive mapping ls therefore a mental  
structuring process that Integrates into a whole what bas been  
perceived in parts.  
Brain lesions n!sultlng ln spatial or topographical amnesia, can  
destroy this cognitive mapping ability while leaving intact all other  
cognitive faculties. This ls a fascinating aspect of brain  
lesion research; it demonstrates the function of a particular ability,  
such as cognitive mapping, by showing what a person can and  
cannot do when deprived of that ability.  
The effect of spatial amnesia on people's ability to g\\'t around  
is dramatic indeed. At the beginning, amnesic patients are totally  
**incapacitated even if they find themselves in previously famUiar**  
environments. Aller a certain adaptation period, patients can learn  
to find their way by substituting verbal for the missing spatial  
ln!ormatlon. Rather than relying on a cognitive map ol a given  
route. they wUJ rely on a verbal checklist. A striking Ulustratlon ls  
given or a truck dri\\•er with spatial anwesla who, alter having  
learned to rely on cheekllsts Instead or physical maps, was able to  
get around sulOclently well to continue working ln his profession.•  
Depending on the spatial cbaracterlsties or an environment,  
cognitive mapping can be very dl!Ocult for everyone, and some-  
times it is an almost Impossibl e operation. Indeed, one or the main  
**disorienting characteristics of a labyrinth is precisely its inherent**  
di!Oculty to be understood in spatial terms and to be mentally  
**represented in the form of a cognitive map.**  
**Spatial orientation has been defined in various terms but all**  
**refer in one way or another to a person's ability to determine his or**  
**her location in a setting.**  
**From a cognitive perspective, spatial orientation is based on**  
the ability to form a cognitive map. You are considered spatially  
oriented U you have an adequate cognitive map of the surrounding  
selling and B1'l able to situate yourseU within that representation.  
This conceptualization of spatial orientation has not only

generated a great deal of research on cognitive maps. tbelr nature,  
their composition, their evolution wben exploring a new setting, or  
their evolution throug\)I a life span, but it has also proven useful in  
exploring some or the spatial characteristi\<lS that f8'lUitate cogni-  
tive mapping. The credit for having made that all· important link  
between spatial orientation and planning goos without doubt to the  
pioneering work of Kevin Lynch.'  
Researchers working in the field of cognitive mapping were  
confronted by major methodological and conceptual problems. It  
proved extremely difficult to have people describe and externalize  
their spatial knowledge and to measure ii reliably. Furthermore, it  
was argued that the term "map" bad to be taken in a metaphorical  
**sense\: a cognitive map was not really a "'map .. as we know it from**  
geography or planning. It was maplike only in the sense that it  
**oonta.ined the same information as an actual map.**  
**6 The most**  
**critical issue oonoerned the notion of adequacy. which is crucial to**  
**the definition of spatial orientation. Researchers asked themselves**  
**if the criteria or an adequate oogn.iti,.-e map were its measurement**  
properties, Its topological properties. or other geometric character·  
!sties.  
The search for an answer v"as dampened by lhe observation  
tbal in many situations people got around quite well and dld not  
feel dlsorlented even If they bad only a very rudimentary under·  
standing or the setting.' Wustratlve examples could be found In  
anthropological Uterature describing navigation and palbfinding  
among Indigenous populations In homogeneous environments. sucb  
as sand deserts. oceans, and snow-covered expanses In the polar  
regions.  
Even way\(inders In contemporary urban settings often cannot  
rely on any topographical accuracy. Complex underground public  
transport interchanges. ror example, tend to be particularly dilfi·  
**cult to map, but people may not consider themselves disoriented as**

24 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN \(.2 Wayftndlng\: the dynamic relaUonsblp to space  
"Wayfinding" was the term introduced to describe the process of  
**reaching a destination, whether in a familiar or unfamiliar environ·**  
ment. Wayfinding is best defined as spatial problem solving. •0  
Within this framework. wayfinding comprises three specific but  
interrelated processes\:  
• *Deci\$i\<m making* and the development of a plan of action  
• *Decisi\<m execution,* which transforms the plan into appropriate  
behavior at the right place in space  
• ***lnlurmation proce.'1si.ng* understood in its generic sense as**  
comprising environmental perception and cognition, which, in  
**turn. are responsible for the information basis of the two deci·**  
# sion·related processes  
At first, It may seem that the concept of a cognltlve map Is lost  
In this dellnlllon of wayfindlng. But this Is not so. Cognlllve map-  
ping is part of environmental perception and cognition. The cogni-  
**tive map is a source or inlonn.ation to make and execute decisions.**  
The relative importance of a cognltive map in the decision-making  
process depends on the nature of the setting and on the context of  
wayfmding. In other words, we have not eliminated the cognltive  
map, we have merely situated it within the much larll"r proooss of  
spatial problem solving.  
Wbat about disorientation? We argue that this is a personal,  
mental, and emotional state. People tend to feel disoriented when  
**they cannot situate themselves within a spatial representation and**  
when. at the same time, they do not ha'"" or cannot develop, a plan  
to roach their destination.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 5.1 Wayflndlng as spatial problem soMng  
Wayfinding is problem soMng. Making a journey and reaching a  
destination are wayfinding goals. Allaining these goals requires  
**action and behavior, som e quite obvious and som e less so.**  
Those that are not obvious may require several steps\:  
• Taking into account previous experiences  
• Reading and evaluating the environmental context  
• Trying to understand the spatial characteristics or the setting  
• Taking in the information displayed on signs, maps, and indlca·  
tors  
• **Assessing different options**  
• **Considering the time factor, the interest. or the securit\}1 that**  
goes with taking a given route  
***U* a journey is taken for the ftrSt time and if the destination is**  
**unfamiliar, you are confronted with a problem for which you must**  
**fmd a solution. The solution is a plan of action.**  
Planning a holiday trip may involve comparing a number or  
possible destinations \(where to go\), checking on various airlines  
\(how to go\). and checking schedules \(when to go\). Planning to visit  
a friend who bas recently moved may involve identifying the new  
address, consulting a route map, and checking your diary to decide  
the three major questions\: where, bow, and when to go. Planning,  
in the !Ina! analysis, is decision making based on available infor-  
mation.  
*U* the sum total or behavior is the physical solution to a  
wayflndlng problem, the net result or decisions is the mental or  
cognitive solution to the problem. Each behavior can be rormulated  
in terms or its underlying decision.  
We are now ready !or a Uttle bit or theory. All the decisions  
necessary !or solving a wayflndlng problem are not Just ly!ng ln our  
minds Uke so many potatoes ln a sack. Decisions are related to  
each other; they are ordered.  
To open a can or mushrooms. !or example, you will need to  
make some very specific decisions\: get the can. get the can opener.  
apply the can opener, and activate the cutting device. Not only  
**must you make these fou. r decisions, you have to execute them in a**  
certain order. First you have to get the can and the opener, then  
you have lo apply the tool, and only then can you start opening the  
# can.  
A decision plan \(or plan ol action\) not only contains the rel·  
evant decisions but it reOects the logic that links the decisions to  
the problem. The same logic links wayflndlng decisions.  
*Wayfltldtng* is *also rontln!J\(\)US problem solving.*  
The problem or reaching an unlamllla.r destination can normally  
not be solved ln all Its detaus before engaging on the Journey.

If the context and the wayfmding tasks are more or less famil-

plan which, during the journey, becomes more precise.' If, however,

*WayfindltlQ ts problem solving 1'ntler uncertainty*  
Adequate Information ls not always available. and what in!orma·  
lion there ls, ls often unclear and ambiguous. Wayfinding must  
cope with uncertainty by keeping problem solving Oexlble, by  
finding new alternatives If a path leads, for example, to a dead end.  
*Wayfindl•lQ ts spatial problem solving*  
The information uaoo to make way!lndlng decisions Is. at least lo  
part, or a spatial nature. It involves a certain understanding and  
manipulation of space. It lnvol\\'llS, as""' have already soon, a  
certain ability to cognitively map spaces that cannot be perceh'lld  
**from one \\•antagc. point alone.**  
Although we have dcseribed wayfinding in terms or spatial  
**problem solving for unfamiliar journeys and destinations, a ques--**  
**tion poses itself at this point in the discussion\: Docs it make sense**  
to talk about way!inding for familiar journeys as well, and should  
we still be thinking in terms of problem solving?  
**A familiar journey can be seen as an ensemble of actions or**  
behavior leading from a point of origin to a destination. The mental  
or cognitive equivalent *ol* thls behavioral ensemble is the plan of  
action described above. To take a familiar route is nol.bing other  
than the execution or an already recorded decision plan and is  
therefore also a part or wayllndlng and problem solving. The only  
difference ls that the emphasis has shifted lrom decision making to  
**decision execution.1**

For wayttndlng design, we are really Interested ooJ,y in deel·  
sions that have to be taken 10 reach a certain destination once the  
original decision to go is made. For these wayflndlng decisions,  
you"d not normally have to choose bet..·een as many options. The  
Information involved In the decision-making proceas Is not as  
divers.med and the choice ls less determined by personal factors.

In studying decision plans on an empirical basis, we found that  
any complex wayf!odiog problem \(and most of them are complex lo  
the detailed analysis\) is broken down loto smaller problems whose  
solutions do not exceed three or four decisions. 7 Complex wayf!od-  
ing problems, thus, become more manageable; a particular aspect  
of the problem can be treated wllile stW keeptog In mind the prob-  
lem as a whole.  
This characteristic of planning is common to all probl em solv-  
ing.8 The planning of a building may serve as an illustrative exam-  
ple. The mnst general decision to plan it materializes in a contract.  
The flrst level of decisions may then correspond to the overall site  
planning, the following level to the layout of the building, and the  
last l e-•el to the working drawings.  
This type of problem solving leads to highly structured plans,  
wblch can also be easUy remembered. Indeed, structure is a major  
mnemonic aid. For most people it is impossible to relain even a  
small selection of random numbers. Some researchers bave even  
argued that magic is associated with the number seven because  
seven Items are the most we can remember lo an unstructured  
fashion. We believe that to remember even seven random units is  
asking a lot.  
On the other band, It is quite easy to retrace the steps of a  
route involving a great number of decisions. It ls also of Interest to  
note that in direct. ion giving, the csoacitv to describe a route In

gl'eater than the capacity ol the wayllnder to retain the description.  
The inlormation-giving person reties on a structured plan ol action  
**while lhe inquiring person receives a string of decisions in a un·**  
structured, and thus unretainable, lonn.  
Although we can recall many decisions ii they are structured.  
we can usually not recall them all. On the other hand, ii we find  
ourselves making a journey that we made once belore, we will  
likely r\<!Cl0gni7.e the place where we had to make the most detailed  
decisions. Recognition \(I.e., remembering when actually In the  
presence ol the relevant situation\) Islar more elficlent than recall.  
**In the actual planning of a journey, a person**  
**may well start with a destination, let us say a**  
specific shop, which is located In a shopping  
**complex. which is in turn located downtown.**  
**When the plan is executed, the order will be**  
**inverted. The first destination is downtown,**  
**then the shopping complex, and then the**  
**specific shop.**  
**recognition\: \(re--cognizing\) remembering**  
**an item in the presence of the item**  
**recall\: remembering an item in the absence**  
**of the item**  
A plan ol action is a mental solution to a wayllndlng problem, but It  
does not In ltseU take you physically to your destination. Decisions  
must first be executed, that Is, they have to be translormed Into  
behavior. Most Importantly, each decision must be transrormed  
Into the right behavior at the right place.  
It Is not enough slmply to turn to the right, you wtll have to turn  
rlgbt at the appropriate Intersection. Decision executing Is, again,  
a hi\(!!!.ly complex proceas. This process has been well deserlbed In  
other publications. Let us here summarize some or the Important  
points relevant to wayflndlng design.'  
A wayfindlng decision is composed ol two parts\:  
I. Behavior. such as turning right, going up, or looking lor inlor-  
matlon  
2. An environmental entity, such as the Intersection, the stairs, or  
thebWboard  
**When executing a decision, we match a mental image or idea of**  
something specific in the environment with what we perceive in the  
environment. II we find the corresponding intersection, stair, or  
bUlboard, we execute the behavioral part ol the decision. If we  
cannot find the corresponding part in the environment, we have a  
very real problem. Because we cannot execute the decision, we  
have to develop a plan to solve this problem. This sllggesls bow to  
define a way!lndlng problem. A waylindlng problem ls a wayfindlng  
decision that cannot be directly executed and that tberelore re-  
quires lurther planning and decision maldng.  
The workings ol decision execution are well Uluslrated In  
neuropsyehologlcal llterature. Brain lesions, we have seen, can  
lead to spatial agnosla wbleh manUests ltseU In the lnabWty to  
recognize spatial leatures. Everytlme the alfected patient looks at  
what should be a rammar sight. such as a street or a building, even  
his or her own home, it appears to be a first encounter. The patient  
will be able to describe and understand all the leatures, but not to  
recognize them. Some patients bave been reported to recall lea-  
tures lrom the period preceding a trauma.  
The neuropsyehologist Paltis studied a case in which a patient  
reDected that in his "mind's eye" be knew exactly where places  
were and what Ibey looked like. He could even remember clearly

some of tho paths he bad taken during bis active Ule. But when be  
found himself on one of the remembered paths. everything looked  
foreign to him. He was unable to recall ever having been there and  
was. of course. , not able to find his way." Although he *saw* the  
relevant environmental features at which to execute the behavioral  
parts of bis decision plan, by not *reOO\(J?•izing* them. he could not  
make the link with bis decision plan.  
Even when taking very familiar routes, decision execution Is  
involved. This process. although highly complex, d\<\>es not require a  
**person's attention. For instance. you can easily drive or walk home**  
**rrom work and engage in a discussion that requires most of your**  
**attention. Ho"'·m·er, if on your drive home you encounter a new**  
on\~way street, obliging you to make a detour, you would probably  
Interrupt your discussion until you bad made the appropriate  
**decision. While decision execution operates on an unconscious**  
level, decision making generally requires attention.  
Taking a familiar route involves executing a recorded decision  
plan. That the reality is a bit more complex is again illustrated in  
neurological literature. Let us recall that people suffering from  
spatial amnesia due to brain lesions are not llble to map space  
cognitively. Although they can learn to get around with a verbal  
description of the necessary behavior, which is nothing other than  
a recorded decision plan, their waylinding efficiency and the ease  
by which Ibey can find their way is greatly reduced.  
In this recorded decision plan, they have access to all decisions  
and to all environmental reatures associated with these decisions,  
but they have no information about the spatial location or about  
what happens betwoon decisions. In other words, they would not be  
able to link one decision to the next *U* it were not lor their chrono-  
logical order.  
The cognitive map has the important support function ol situat-  
ing the decision in space. As we have seen, taking a lamlllar route  
is executing a recorded decision plan, but a plan that is linked to a  
spatial representation. Even if the representation is only partial  
\(and may even be rudimentary to the point of being almost non-  
**exis· tent\) in certain environmental contexts - even if it is limited to**  
**recognition on site rather than to recall - it still provides the**  
**wayfmder with a means of locating decisions in space or at least of**  
relating one decision to the next. The relationship and dynamics  
**bet¥ .. een decision plans and cognili\\•e maps are a most interesting**  
area of research.  
It bas been suggested by various authors that cognitive map-  
ping is supported by the formation and execution of travel plans."  
The hierarchical structure of decision plans helps us to remember  
not only decisions but also the spatial entities associated with  
them. This assumption explains the common experience that it is  
easier for people to remember a route if they make the wayfmding  
decisions by themselves than If Ibey are following a guide. Al-  
though when guided. they are exposed to the same environmental  
Information, because they are not making the decisions, but merely  
executing them. they are not effectl,.ely recording the decision  
plan.

5-3 lnlonnatloo processing  
Peroeptioo and cognltlon are the components or Information  
processing. Perception and cognition are interrelated, and it is  
often dilficult to distinguish one process clearly from the other. The  
**distinction is useJul. however\: one relates to the process of obtain·**  
ing information through the senses \(perception\), the other to the  
**understanding and manipulation of information, in particular**  
spatial information \(cognition\).  
Perceplion bas traditionally been a major field ol study in  
psychology. but. as William lttelson observed in 1973, we know  
**very little about environmental perception.1 2 This statement is still**  
true today. We know, in !act, very little about what people perceive  
in the everyday environment, bow they perceive while they are  
moving and being active, and bow they cope with complex situa-  
tions in which a lot or information bas to be processed.  
lttelson argued that the dillerenoe between the elementary  
peroeptlon or lorm, object. and depth, and environmental peroep-  
tlon was not just one or scale. Environments are peroelved through  
dllferent sensory modalllles. Environments are unbounded and  
surround a person, calllng !or exploration rather than passive  
exposure.  
Given their complexity. environments need to be peroelved  
seleellvely. and the relevance or the obtained lnlormallon needs to  
be assessed as well. Most Important or all, environments are per-

Complexity **and** overload  
One or the environment's most striking characteristics ls tu. com-  
plexity. The wayllndlng person cannot take in everytltltlg, but must  
select that which Is useful, in other words, that which ls relevant to  
the decision-making process.  
We have been able to document many instances which show  
that when people are executing a decision plan or part or a plan,  
they will perooive Information directly relevant to that plan. Infor-  
mation that is not directly applicable to the immediate plan, even if  
**it would be relevant sometime later, tends not to be seen. The.**  
**location of information is therefore a crucial issuc,. It is not an**  
exaggeration to say that information at the wrong place is as good  
**as no information at all**  
**In certain complex settings, thls selection of information could**  
be more difficult. This is particularly true if wayllnders are bom-  
barded with stimulation ol all sorts and if, at the same time, they  
**must plow through this excess to fmd relevant information. In such**  
cases, a condition of overload could develop in which people reduce  
their intake or information as an ultimate coping device. The result  
is that even if they are looking at the relevant information, they are  
not able to process it.  
It should be noted that a lot ol stimulatlon does not in itself  
necessarily lead to overload. The environment always contains  
more information than we can process. Overload O\<X\>Urs when  
stimulation interferes with purposeful Information processing. It ls  
only when a person ls aetl,,ely looking !or Information in a contus-  
ing environmental context that the risk or overload O\<X\>Urs. Over-  
load can be averted by design interventions aimed at helping the  
user to find the relevant information.

How the w ayflndlng proc\:eu works  
**5.3 Inform ation processing**  
**There are three different types of braille.**  
**Grade 1 braille is strict transliteration of the**  
**original language; however. grade 2 braille,**  
**which includes many contractions, is much**  
**more effie\:ient to use. Grade 3 is a type of**  
**shorthand and does not concern us here.**  
**Onty about one in ten of those registered**  
**with blind organizations can read grade 2**  
**braille, although rather more can read grade**  
**1\. The assumption that every blind person**  
**can read braille is certainly false.**

• PcrceMng an original sound source in the environment  
• PerceMng sound produced by the person \(e.g., cane lapping\)  
and reflected by objects in tbe environment \(ech\<\>-looatlon\)  
The value of a sound source for wayfindlng Is often reduced  
because of the unreliability of tbe source. You can, for example, see  
a tree from a given distance, but you can only bear It wben the  
wind blows. Ech\<\>-location is more reliable in this sense, but It  
**requires a relatively quiet environment and only works at small**  
distances. You can "bear" a tree through ech\<\>-location only if you  
are direcUy in Iron! of it.  
II bas been argued that only blind people have developed the  
ability to use sound to identify objects. We don't think this is so. In  
an unpublished study done a few years ago \(Romedi Passini\),  
blindfolded, sighted subjects were also found, surprisingly. to be  
capable of ldentlfy!ng openings, barriers, and even relatively smali  
overhangs through ech\<\>-looation.  
Sounds are perceived regardless ol bead position. Sounds for  
that reason are excellent warning cues. Crossing a busy slreet  
without being able to bear is quite an unsetUing experience for  
anybody. Indeed, deaf people, because they cannot rely on sound  
signals, tend to be excessively !earful of accidents. To make lhings  
worse, almost ali evacuation warnJng systems \(flre alarms, for  
example\) are based on sound signals. Salety Is probably one of the  
ma jor conceros or deaf and hearing-Impaired people.  
Sound, by the same token. ls much more dllficult to screen than  
visual stimulation. Screening, when using a hearing aid, ls particu-  
larly troublesome. This in itself is a good reason why we should be  
concerned about the soundseape or our built environment. We are  
singularly indifferent to noise pollution -even when we know that  
**noise obscures informative sounds and that the effects of noise. on**  
stress and health have been clearly demonstrated.  
Tactual and baptie perception apply only to proximal objects.  
**The white cane of the blind person is an extension of his or her**  
**a.rm. but that is as far as it goos. The cane sen-es to identify obsta·**  
cles and to follow direction-giving lines such as a curb or the edge  
or a footpath.  
**Braille and raised letters, raised numbers, and even some**  
raised symbols are read by the blind population. The difficulty with  
using tactile slgnage, however, ls that blind way!inders fll'St must  
know where the information Is located before they are able to use  
it. Furthermore. it has been noted that a social stigma ls attached  
to tactile exploration. At a conference held by the SOOD \(Society of  
Environmental Graphic Designers\) in 1988, a blind speaker,  
Michele Brule, illustrated this point with the poignant question\:  
"Do you see me exploring the white wali or the Impeccable glass  
door or the corporate omee in order to find the company's name?"  
Tactile maps ha"e been shown to be use ful to blind travellers.  
Just like the reading of braille and of raised letters and symbols,  
the reading of tactile maps has to be learned. !Wsearchers have  
**identified characteristics of tactile maps that facilitate their use.**  
**They have also developed techniques £or producing tactile maps**

Few would argue that we have lost the ablllty to lollow our  
noses, although our sense or smell ls not usually enough to get us  
home. Our pereeption or odors Is simply not fine enough to give us  
many directional cues. Our sense or smell may have some limited  
use aa a cue for place Identification but It tends to be very unrell-  
able In our contemporary environment.  
Some research baa shown that stimulations, usually associated  
with one particular sense, could be perceived by other senses as  
well. A French psychologist by the name of Duplessis, tried to show  
that discrimination of colors without sight was possible. According  
to her studies, about 20 percent of the population is able to dis-  
criminate colors by what she calls dermo-optic perception. We  
tried to replicate the experiments In a wcll-rontrolled study, but

**In** \~rfume, **1 ' a novel by the German author**  
**Patrick SQskind, Grenouille is a malevolent**

**of capturing and preserving the fragrance of**  
**\(not for\) a particular girt. By his nose, he**

**outside his workshop and immediately**  
**knows that something is wrong** . . .  
**"The atmosphere was not a.s It should have**  
**been, from the town's aromatic garb, that**  
**veil of many thousands of woven threads,**  
**the girl's golden thread was missing** ... **it**  
**was gone, vanished, untraceable despite the**  
**most intense s niffing." Even though the girt**  
**leaves town, Grenouille, using "the compass**  
**of his nose," follows her half.way across**  
**France, murders her, and at last successfully**  
**captures and distills the essence he has**  
**sought for so long.**  
The meaning or cognilion is knowing and understanding. Two  
aspects or environmental cognition can be dlstlnguished\:  
1. The knowledge people have about the given components or a  
setting, such as the buildings they remember in a cityscape  
2. The understanding or the spatial characteristics or a setting,  
whlch has already been described as a cognitive map  
The things we remember  
It may be or interest to know which buildings people remember  
best, but more important for the planner ls an understanding or the  
physical and non-physical characteristics that make buildings  
memorable. Researchers studied these characteristics and arrived  
at four !actors that enhance memory for buildings In a cityscape\:  
t. The rorm or the building; us size, contours, compleXity or shape.  
and uniqueness or architectural style  
2. Vlslblllty and access\: pedestrian access and the posslblllty or  
moving around the building  
3. Use; II a building had an Important !unction and was used orten,  
It was also well remembered  
4. Symbolic slgnlllcance\: elderly citizens were particularly aware  
or historical and cultural meanings associated with buildings"  
Cognitive mapping  
The representation and mapping or the spatial characteristics or  
the environment has been a subject or research and debate for  
many years. Research in the early 70s aimed at dm'Oloplng a  
typology of cognitive maps. A distinction was made between two  
types of cognitive mapping\:  
l. People may structure the environment in terms or routes, that is,  
the points where they change direction, the angle or directional  
**change, and a measure of tne distance from one point to ana**  
**other.**

**and sequential, leading to a representation in the form of a strip or**  
route map. The seoond type has been referred to as coordinate,  
**leading to a representation in the form of a survey map.**  
# 10  
In the procese or mapping a new environment, some research-  
ers showed that people tended to start by recording landmarks a.nd  
used them as a.nchor-points to subsequenUy 1111 in the paths;"  
others have assumed paths and districts to be the original structur-  
ing element." The choice may well be detennl.Ded by the type or  
environment and the predominance ol one or the other ol these  
!eatures as much as by personal pre!erence.  
During the last decade, some oognltlve and environmental  
psychologists have made a distinction between two types ol repre-  
sentations\:  
I. *A propositional representalion* Is seen to be schematic and  
somewhat abstract In nature; the representation ol a setting  
based on personal exploration tends to be or that order.  
2. *An analogue representation* ls seen to be figural and \~taltllke  
In nature; learning a setting from a physical map can be  
seen to result In a figural representation."  
The distinction is or interest because different characteristics  
are associated wltb each type or representation. The representa-  
tion or a route learned !rom a physical map \(analogue representa-  
tion\) tends to be oriented. One will ·see· a map in one's mind's eye,  
although it may have to be turned to align with the setting. The  
representation o! a route learned wbJJe exploring a setting  
\(propoeitionai representation\) is not oriented a.nd therefore is  
more Oexible in usage. On tbe other ba.nd it may be less precise."  
Research has shown that both representations can coexist even *U*  
they contain contradictory information.  
It ls one thing to have a representation or a setting. It is quite  
another to manipulate Ibis representation so that it can be used to  
solve waylinding problems. In order to study these spatio-cognitive  
manipulations. we have ldentiJled as many basic wayflndlng tasks  
as possible." For each. we have detennl.Ded the necessary spati\<\>-  
oognlttve manipulation. Se\\'On distinctive tasks and seven corre-  
sponding spatio-cognitive manipulations are retained as crucial !or  
waylindlng. They are summarized here.

This short overview ol wayllndlng demonstrates how Interest-

ever make Is based on wayllndlng, tbe process works surprisingly  
weU. With the exception ol some specific spa\~goltlve opera-  
tions, such as mental rotation, people are quite skilled at spatial  
problem solving.  
The wayf111ding dilllculties they have are usuaUy due to par-  
ticular features of the environment. It may, for example, be difficult  
to understand the spatial organization of a setting because It is too  
complex or, more likely, because it Is not clearly articulated. On  
the other hand, relevant Information may be dilllcult \(or Impossi-

Principles of wayfinding design Chapter 6  
**What is wayfinding design?**  
Wayfindlng requirements, whether they be at the regional,  
urban, or architectural scale, are Integral to tbe design pro-  
cess - from tbe most general, overall spatial organization of  
the setting to the articulation of tbe form-giving festures, and  
right down to the Individual architectural and graphic mes-  
sages. Wayftndlng requirements shape the setting, allect  
the choice of the circulation system, and contribute to the  
design of tbe Interior. Tbls ls particularly true In large build-  
ing complexes.  
The enormous Impact ol wayflndlng cooslderatloos on the  
outcome of the design of a setting Is one of the reasons we feel  
justtned In using tbe term "wayflnd.lng design."  
The other reason Is strategic. Wayflndlng Is a very Impor-  
tant aspect of dally We and bas been neglected for so long that  
we want to give It Its rightful place on tbe drawing board. We  
are totally convinced on this subject. Even II It can be argued  
that, In tbe past, the built enVlronment was relatively simple  
and clear, this Is certainly not true of today's mammoth build-  
ing complexes.  
When "wayllndlog design" becomes a consideration In Its  
own right \(llke "HVAC" or •emergency exit procedures"\),  
planoers wW be made aware that It Is a vital part of design,  
and II they pride themselves on being professionals, they  
should know about It. Wayllndlng design Is also a principle.  
It Is user oriented and derives Its approach and Its Interven-  
tions from the behavioral and psychological fonndatlons of  
wayllndlng.  
l!lllclent, accessible, sale, and spatially attractive wayflnd-  
lng environments can be designed only when the principles  
of wayflndlng are understood and when this knowledge Is  
translated Into applicable form. Tbe aim of this chapter ts  
to make the link between design and the wayflndlng princi-  
ples Introduced previously. Two aspects of wayflndlng design  
wW retain our attention\: spatial planning and environmental  
communication.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 6.1 Spatial planning  
Wayflndlng occurs Jn space. The spatial cba.racterlstlcs or a site,  
that ls, Its size, Its organization, and the nature or Its elreulatlon  
systems, all contribute In one way or another to the way!lndlng  
dllficultles that confront the site's users.  
Spatial planning provides the context !or wayflndlng and sets  
the stage !or the problem-soMng per!ormance. Spatial planning  
determines the location of the entrances and exits or a setting, the  
location of the major destinations and, there!ore. the nature of Its  
circulatlon system, the organization of Its spaces, and the visual  
accessibility of Its architecture. Spatial planning not only defines  
the wayfmdlng problems or the future users. but affects the ease or  
difficulty they wUI have in understanding and cognitively mapping  
the setting. Spatial planning is, therefore. the first major compo-  
nent in wayfmding design.

Wbat makes good spatial planning? To answer lhis question  
satlsfaclorUy, we have to return IO lbe notion of decision pl&ns.  
Let's reealJ that a decision pl&n Is the user's solution to a  
wayllnding problem posed by the spatial organization and the  
associated cfl'\<\)ulatlon system. We can therefore expect a close  
relationship between spatial organizations and decision plans.  
Wben planning a new setting. planners should start with a  
decision diagram representing the desired way for the users to  
solve wayfmding problems In the settlng. and then develop lrom  
tho appropriate circulation system and spatial organization.  
**The illustration shows the relationship between a simpl e deci·**  
sion diagram for a multi-purpose setting, the accompanying circu-  
lation system, and a possible spatial organization. In *this* example,

particular o!llce Is to be obtained. The underlying organization Is  
hierarchical in this case. **Original from**

The !WO examples are intended lo illuslrale the principle or  
using decision diagrams in spatial planning. Chapter 10 will  
provide a more detailed look at Ibis issue.  
In an existing building, !be spatial organization and the circula-  
llon system are g1,·ens, and so, lbererore, are the basic decision  
diagrams. The planner should still identify these diagrams, hov.•-  
ever, to belier understand the existing system. Design interven-  
tions can then alm at articulating !he system and making it pereep-  
lually accessible and clear lo the users.  
The main design task in an existing selling is lo develop an  
appropriate inlormallon system. The decision diagrams serve as  
the basis ror !be design or the inlormation system.  
**We are fully aware of the fact that the**  
**design process is not as sequential a, s may be**

**with a spatial idea and only then think**  
**about the circulation and the decision dia·**

6.2 Environmental communication  
The S«ond major component or waylinding design is en,1ronmen-  
tal communication. Many waylinding dlflicutlles are due lo aspects  
or inrormalion processing. Providi.ng the relevant wayfinding  
**information in the environment is an issue both in architectural**  
and in graphic design.  
The design or an information system has to be based on  
people's wayflndlng behavior. It must contain all !he necessary

The content and location of Information  
Let us first look at the decision-making and decision-executing  
aspects of wayfinding.  
***U,* as we ba,·e outlined above, information is needed for each**  
wayfinding decision that is made and executed, it follows lhat lhe  
particular lolormation that the wayfinder gathers is determined by  
lhe decisions that lhat person must make.  
It is lhe decisions or. when seen lo their totality, the decision  
plan that is the determlnlog factor lo designing an lolormatlon  
system. U, lor a gt'•en decision, we can.not assume that the users  
have the required lolormation lo the lorm ol com.moo knowledge.  
lheo lhe lolormatlon has to be provided through architectural.  
graphic, or other. non-graphic means.  
It is important to emphasize that waylloding design should be  
concerned not only with lndlvidual decisions but with a series of  
them \(i.e., the structured ensemble ol decisions that leads the  
wayfindlng person to his or her destination\).  
The logic of the decision plan \(or dlagram\) is the rationale that  
**tics individual decisions into a whole. and this same rationale must**  
# tie the information units into the overall system.  
Much signage is concerned only with installing signs al inter-  
**sections. Such a procedure ignores the information needed for**  
decisions lhat do not directly lead to behavior. In other words, it  
ignores lhe higher-order decisions structuring the plan.  
*An* lolormalion unit has to be perceived at, or shortly before. a  
decision point. Otherwise the lolormation tends not to be noticed.  
In order to establish the *location* ol the required lolormation, the  
designer has to transfer the d.ctsions ol the diagram to the route.

they obtain information about the omoo zone wb.icb. for argument's  
sake, is subdivided into three complexes A, B, and C. The visitors  
will need to be able to determine  
• that there are three complexes,  
• where the complexes are located, and  
• lo wblch complex their particular destination ls located.  
Again, we can see the interplay of arcbitectural and graphic  
**information. *U* the architectural expression of the three lobbies is**  
clear, a minimum of signs will be necessary. *U* nol, the burden of  
describing the exlstenoo of the three ccmplexes, !heir location, and  
what each ccnt&Jns beccmes a graphic ccmmunication issue.  
In the elevator lobby of the complex. visitors should find the  
proolse addresses \(Door level and omoo number\) of each of the  
tenants. In this description, we always provide Information in  
sequence. Information about the destination woes appears onoo  
the visitors have entered the building. lnlormation about the or-  
ganization of the o!lloo complex Is provided onoo they have reached  
the o!!ioo square. The address system Is provided once they have  
reached the elevator lobby, and so on.  
This, we know now, Is the optimum way to locate Information.  
It always appears when the visitors are lo need of It to develop  
their plan.  
In designing the overall information system for the setting,  
cacb major route has to be thought through in these terms. Once  
**the system is worked out, the designer will ha\\•e to fit in the multi·**  
**tudc of secondary information which is also essential for the cffi·**  
**cient functioning of the setting.**  
**A checklist of specific information needs in public buildings is**  
provided in Appendix 2\: Anatomy of a public building complex.

Some practical considerations  
The reader at this point may well wonder if our approach. although  
plausible in principle, is at all practical. It might be thought, for  
example, that in a complex setting there are as many dlf!ercnt  
**decision plans as there. arc routes, and that Cor each route there**  
**are as many decision plans as there are people. IC this were really**  
**so, however, v.•e would have to forget about wayfinding design**  
altogether.  
**It is true that in a.ny large setting an almost infmite number of**  
way!inding tasks and routes can be identified - if one were to link  
all possible points ol origin lo all possible points or destination. It is  
**also true that some routes would be more representati,·e of peo-.**  
pie's movement in the setting \(i.e., primary routes\) and that others  
\(I.e., secondary and tertiary routes\) would be of lesser importance.  
Elsewhere we have described three kinds of primary routes\:  
• **The main circulation between the entrances or exits or a setting**  
**and the major destination zones**  
• **The circulation from one major destination zone to another**  
• **The circulation within a major destination zone**  
**Original from**  
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN The nature and size of the major destination zones wlU vary  
!rom site to site. E\:xamples of major destination zones for large  
multipurpose urban or suburban complexes may be the omce  
section, the residential section, or the shopping section. The prl·  
mary routes \(even of very complex settings\) are quite limited in  
numbers. II the information system is clear and effective for the  
primary routes, it will set the waylinding tone for the whole of the  
setting. The system will dominate the secondary and tertiary  
routes. Specific information will still be needed for these latter  
routes, but they will be integrated into the overall scheme.  
Do people who take the same route develop different decision  
plans? This question is crucial. II everybody were to develop !unda·  
**mentally different decision plans, these plans would be of no use in**  
the design of wayfinding information systems. Fortunately, how·  
ever, there is a direct link between the spatial organization of a  
set Ung with its related circulation system and the most appropri·  
ate decision plan.  
Each type of circulation demands its own type of decision plan.  
Thus, ii the appropriate Information is provided, people on the  
whole will develop slmllar plans. This makes good sense. Alter all,  
tbe waylinding problem is the same for all people, and ii the Infor-  
mation to solve the problem Is the same, the solution should be the  
same as well. This does not, however, exclude people's having  
preferences and choosing one route rather than another for a  
multitude of personal reasons.  
Empirical wayfindlng data shows this to be essentially true, but  
it also points to the need for further clarification.  
The information a person seeks in order to solve his or her  
wayfmding problem is not determined by the environmental setting  
alone. It also depends on bis or her preference for a certain kind of  
**information - whether it is linear and sequential \(such as one**  
might find on signs\), or whether it is spatial and global \(such as  
that emanating !rom the spatial organization of the setting itself\).  
These two way!inding styles are not exclusive. Most people use  
**both. They will at various times have preferences for one over the**  
other. These preferences are adjusted according to the character-  
istics of the setting or to wayfinding conditions \(i.e., the normal,  
·everyday," the recreational, and the emergency wayf10ding condi·  
lions. which are described at length in Chapter 9\). The reader may  
have already made the Unk between these information preferences  
and the typology or cognitive maps discussed in the previous  
chapter.  
People who have a tendency to structure information on a  
sequential basis will also have a tendency to seek this type of  
information. On the other hand, people who structure information  
on a spatial basis will seek information giving them an idea of bow  
the setting is organized, and how it is linked by the circulation  
system.  
It should be noted that while the decision plans in both eases  
**may be identical, the information leading to the decisions m&\:y**  
vary. It is therefore important that both spatial and linear informa·  
lion be provided to allow for both way!inding styles.

What i s wayfinding deslgn7  
**6.2 Environmental communication**  
Up to this point we have concentrated on the content and the loca-  
tion of wayflnding information. The third major aspect of environ-  
mental communication Is *f\<\>nn.* which Is concerned not only with  
esthetics but also with key information processing aspeets. Envi-  
ronmental perception and cognition provide the theoretical founda-  
**tions for the formal aspect of environmental communication.**  
**These matters are discussed again in graphic**  
**terms in Chapter 13.**  
**legibility\: the ease with which information**  
**is able to be perceived**  
**reJKlabllfty\: the ease with which** informa\~  
**tion is able to be understood**  
Legtblllty and nwl•blllty  
Typically, visitors trying to make use of the information displayed  
**for their benefit may encounter one of h\\.·o major flaws\:**  
• The Information may not be legible in that It Is obstructed. badly  
pl4'l00, too small, blurred, garbled, or tactually too mushy to be  
perceived.  
• The information may not be readable in that It can be perceived  
but cannot be understood.  
Many people refer to the terms "legibility• and "readability• as  
though they were Jntercbangeable. They aren't.  
Leg!blllty ls a key Issue and needs speelal mention In this  
chapter on design principles. In the previous secllon, we saw that  
environmental perception ls based on a process of scanning and  
glanelng. Objects or mess\~ are focused upon for a short period  
of time. The Image thus obtained Is held in a short-term visual  
\(iconic\) memory which has a llmlted retention capacity.  
The llmited capaci!\)' of this short-term visual memory bas a  
marked impact on the graphics, in particular on the presentation of  
written mes\~. Studies have shown that on signs and maps only  
**a small number of written items. generally throe. at most. can be**  
read at a glance. If more than throe items are presented. they  
should be grouped into packages not exceeding that desired *limit.*  
The wayfindlng person will then be able to read the m essage in a  
few glances \(see also section 13.4.1\).  
Most written information displays, such as signs and maps, arc  
not designed with this basic perceptual rule in mind. They arc hard  
lo read in a glance, and the users. ii they think that they need tbe  
information badly enough. have to stop and resort to a more linear  
"book reading" style.  
Legibility and readability In complex settings can also be  
affected by a state of mind often described as general confusion,  
whlcb ls brought about by information overload. This phenomenon  
of Information processing can be averted by design Interventions  
that help the user to find the relevant information.  
Consistency in the design of Information displays will help a  
wayfindingperson's search by lndlcatingwhat to look for. The  
form that the information takes, the material used. and the graph-  
**ics arc all contributing elements. An information display should be**  
able to be identified before it can actually be read. People learn to  
**recognize such displays after having seen them just onoo or twice**  
before.

However, the reeulla would have been more el!ectlve II the color

haphazard application of such ln!ormatlon to columDB and walls,

o! overload. Structuring can relate to !orm and content. *Form*

*Ccmlenl. structure* re!ers to the order o! information In the decl-

and thereby contributlog to the lmageabllity or a setting Is the  
clarity or the spatial organization and the architectural expression  
or the underlying principle. Once people have understood the way a  
settlog Is organized, they also have a pretty good cognitive map or  
the setting.  
Environmental communication affects cognitive mapping. The  
legjbUlty or key architectural elements \(such as entrances, circula-  
tion both horizontal and vertical, major landmarks\) is a prerequi-  
site to understanding the spatial organization. It is obviously not  
enough to have a clear spatial organization ii it is not understood.  
The principle of the organization bas to be communicated to the  
wayfmding users.  
**The fll"8t thing that comes to mind when one thinks about**  
cognitive mapping and graphic information are map displays and  
models. Indeed, map displays, ii they can be read. provide users  
with a binl's-eye view which they cannot otherwise get. But map  
displays are not the only form of graphic information facilitating  
cognitive mapping. The structuring of the information on signs  
according to the decision diagrams will also contribute to a better  
understanding or the underlying spatial organization. In some  
cases, the use or color and memorable terms to designate certain  
areas may help to structure the setting.  
In summary, we have identllled two major components or  
way!lndlng design\: spatial planning and envll'Oomental communi-  
cation. Environmental communication can be broken down Into  
lnJormatlon concernlng the declsion-maklng and declslon-execut·  
Ing process on the one band, and the cognitive-mapping process  
on the other. In Chapters 10 tbrougll 15. we shall be looking at  
these aspects or wayllndlng design from arcbltectural and graphic  
perspectives lo order to ldentily the relevant design components.  
6.3 An Integrated view of wayflnding design  
The diagram or the waylindlng pyramid summarizes the design  
principles discussed so rar. The user Is the ultimate reference or  
wayllodlng design and is therefore represented at the top or the  
pyramid. Of course, we are not Interested lo any personal aspect of  
the user. but lo the wayllndlng process. It is an understanding of  
how users solve wayllndlog problems - of how they make deci·  
sions. bow they execute these decisions, and bow they perceive  
and understand the environment - that should al!ect the planning  
of the layout and the designing of the wayfinding information  
system. It is therefore in respect of the wayfinding process that a  
setting can be judgro to be wayfinding efficient, accessible, and  
**sale.**  
Spatial planners are responsible !or designing lhe layout of a  
**setting and its circulatjon system . G raphic designers are responsi-**  
ble !or designing lhe information system. That is the conventional  
wisdom. but it is only partly accurate.  
Less obvious is the fact that because spatial planners cannot  
avoid communicating wa\)1lndlng information about their buUdlngs,  
they are also designers or the lnJormation system. Graphic design-  
ers, on the other band, do more than just design the signs. They

52 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ha,·e an Important role to play ln Interpreting and expressing the  
character or !be setting. Whlle both cllsclpllnes have their own  
speclnc Junctions within lhls process. the overlap Is so luge that a  
close relatlonshlp at an early planning stage Is of paramount  
lmponance In good -...yfmcllngdesign.  
Wbat do apaUal plaruicrs haw to know about tbe wayflncllng  
process to design efllclcnt, M»'SSible, sale, and intere81tng lay·  
outs? They ha'-e to know about cognitive mapping and assure  
themseJ\\'etl that their l\~ts can be spatially understood. More  
than that, they have to know about wayfmding in terms or problem  
solving, because In designing the layout they determine the  
wayfmdlng problems that ruture users will have to solve. \(ln Chap-  
ter 10 \\\\'e shall be looklng at this Issue in some detail.\) They also  
have to communicate relevant architectural wayfincllng lnlorma-  
llon to lho users. \(This will be addressed in Chapter 11.\)  
What do graphic designers have to know about the wayflndlng  
process lo design emclent, leglble, and readable inlonnallon  
systems? All of the above and more. They have to provide all the  
lnlormatlon ror the users to be able to make and execute their  
decisions. This includes Information about speclnc tenants, laclll·  
tie&, and special 8\\'eota. It also Includes the DUls and bolts ol  
graphic communication \(wblcb wtll be cowred ln Chapters 12  
througb 14\).  
Unfortunately, coming ln as Ibey genenilly do at the end rather  
than the beginning or the design process, graphlc designers are  
frequently called upon to apply their bandages and cosmetics to  
provide the 1lmulatlon or order when, in !act, none m11y exist.  
We propoec an Integrated appl'OllClt to wayfinding design. The  
layout or a setting and the -...yfmding information system con·  
tained In It have to be Intimately related. For the users, th.ls lrana·  
!ates into a coherent correspondence between their wa.yflnding  
problems and tho lnlormatlon avallable to solve them. II this  
coherence la aehlC\\•ed, the design of the layout ol a selling and Its  
environmental communication will be mutually reinforcing.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN **7.1** The design profession  
No. signs would not have done the trick. They needed a master  
builder like Dwxlalus to create tbe most confusing and disorienting  
labyrinth, one fit to imprison the Minotaur. If the mythical architect  
were able to build a perfectly disorienting building. he should also  
have been able to build a perfectly orienting one. Able or not,  
today"s architects, including urban planners, have an enormous  
impacl on the wayfindlng suocess or !allure or a setting.  
In planning the layout, they are creating the setting and the  
wayfmdlng problems future users will have to solve. In articulating  
the setting. they are providing the users with much ol the neces-  
sary information to solve the wayltndlng problems at hand.  
The notion ol wayltndlng ls relatively recent. and It ls only lair  
to say that arcbltects and urban deslgners have always been aware  
or the importance or the spatial organlzatlon ol a setting and or the  
ensuing clroulatlon system. This, alter all, touches on the essence  
of arcbltecture and city plannlng. ln focusing attention on  
wayltndlng, spatial planning Is brougllt into a new Ugbt - one that  
Is user lrlendly and has all the potential for stimulating new crea-  
tive thtnklng.  
Architectural practice in the last decades has g1\:me from one  
crisis to another, and much bas been said about the underlying  
crisis of meaning. Some ask whether architecture Is deprived ol all  
meaning or whether it still bas something to say about our contem-  
porary society. It may, or It may not, have something to say about  
contemporary society, but what ls certain *iB* that architecture has  
to say something about itself. It has to communicate its content, its  
**spatial organization. its circulation system. entrances, exits,**  
horizontal and vertical paths. Architecture has to have distinct and  
**memorable feature8 and destination zones. In other words, it has**  
to communicate wayfmdlng information. We feel this to be a solid  
basis !or architectural design and that new thinking and new rorms  
and, above all, a new coherence or expression can emerge tbrougb  
wayltndlng design.  
Architects and urban planners have to work with other proles-  
sionals at all stages or the design process. from preliminary con-  
ceptual drawtngs to detailed work.Ing drawtngs. Given that graphic  
deslgners are usually responsible for an Important part or  
wayflndlng communlcallon In complex settings, they become the  
architect's natural collaborators In wayfindlng design.  
The role or arcbltects and urban designers *iB* not to supervise  
tbe graphic designer but to collaborate with him or her in order to  
arrive at a coherent tnformallon system. The earlier the collabora-  
tion begins, the smoother the process and the better the chance or  
creating a quality building in terms or people's efficiency or move-  
ment, in terms or their &CCeBBibility and safety. and in terms or  
their general appreciation.

design is a relatively new calling, dating only from the early 606.  
Until recently, it recruited its members exclusively from the ranks  
of graphic designers.  
In the early 70s the Society of Environmental Grapblc Design-  
ers \(SEGO\) was formed with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts,  
and ever since has assumed a leading and inOuential role In rais-  
*ing* professional standards and in broadening an understanding of  
the graphic designer's function in the environmental and architec-  
tural contexts.  
The SEGO bas also taken a lively and intelligllnt interest in  
**education - so far. hov.rever. in the race or a less-tban·li\\•ely re-**  
sponse from the groves of academe. The institutions of learning  
clalm that their curricula are already lull and that they cannot,  
**therefore, accommodate new courses on subjects like environmen·**  
ta! communication.  
Tbls ralses a problem In that Increasingly in future, arcbltects  
and grapblc designers will have to be forming closely knit collabo-  
rations In the development of environmental communlce.tion and  
very few Institutions are Interested In preparing them for tbls.  
The role of the arcbltect In wayllndlng design has been de-  
scribed in the preceding section. In any case, the role ol the arcbl-  
tect has always been well established and we aU know wbat archi-  
tects do. Whal. however, does the graphic designer do In tbls new  
**context of collaboration on environmental communications**  
projects? His or her prime contribution is a thorough knowledge of  
the effective planning and organization of tw\<Hlimensional spaee.  
This knowledge must be tempered by a more than nodding  
acquaintance with industrial design and the requirements of pubUc  
safety.  
In addition, it must be assumed the graphic designer on the  
team is thoroughly up to date on developments in the sign industry.  
which, with the advent or computeNiriven equipment \(such as  
computerized cutters and plotters\), have been advancing very  
rapidly.  
The grapblc designer also bring\$ an extensive knowledge that  
Includes the following grapble tecbnlques\:  
• hand graphics  
• typograpblcs  
• pictograpblcs  
• photographies  
Allhoug!I a knowledge of environmental paychology is not  
generally to be expected from the graphic designer, knowing about  
**the processes of environmental perception and cognition is more**  
than ·a help." Environmental psychology is an essential part of  
wayllnding design and, therefore, needs to be considered a part of  
the graphic designer's education.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN **Finally, because environmental communication is not limited to**  
arcbltectural and grapblc information, but comprises audible or  
**verbal information as well, some member of the team must be**  
conscious of the important role that voice will play in the context of  
wayfinding design.  
**We now know for certain that some forms of information within**  
the environment are most effectively communicated through sound.  
People would, for example, much rather \(ii they had the choice\) be  
*told* bow to get to their destination than have to figure it out from a  
sign or a map.  
It therefore becomes Incumbent on the team to provide for  
verbal and audible Information, and In our experience It Is gener-  
ally the grapblc designer's IU.nction to do so. \(It Is also bls or her  
function to provide guidelines for tra!nlng the personnel who wUJ  
staff the Information desks.\)  
All of this ls a far cry from the role the graphlc designer Is  
prepared for in most or our art and design schools. As Edward  
Carpenter \(writing about waylindlng in *Print* magazine\) put It 80  
well\: "With the compl exity of today's mammoth building projects,  
the need to design buildings friendly to the user is more urgent  
than ever. Graphic designers who perceive the problem should do  
more about it than take an arcbltect out for lunch.·•  
Landscape archltects are Involved In waylindlng design when  
planning large areas for recreation and work sucb as parks. golf  
courses, athletic facilities, promenades, and bicycle paths.  
Wayfmding design in archltecture and in landscape archltecture  
have many aspects in common. In planning the layout, they set the  
wayfmding stage; in articulating the landscape, they communicate  
the necessary information to the waylinding person.  
In terms of waylinding design, landscape differs from arcblte\<\>  
lure not 80 much in content as in the vocabulary used. Landscape  
arcbltects also compose with paths, landmarks, and destination  
**zones. They also organize space and communicate a circulation**  
system.  
One of the underestimated functions of landscape architecture  
Is site planning. In the conception of a campus, a large residential  
area. or a large exhibition complex, It Is landscape architecture  
that defines the spatial organization and the circulation system at  
the extra-building scale.  
If we focus on the bulldlng Itself, the landscape can put Its form  
Into perspective. It can make the bull ding visually accessible and  
can emphasize the location of Its entrances. In certain cases,  
where the doors are hidden, It may well be that the landscape  
provides the only available information about where to enter.  
Special features of the landscape can help users to distinguish  
one part of the setting from another and thus assist the cognitive-  
mapping process. Landscape features can even announce the  
spatial organization the visitor will find inside the building. V1Stas

Without \~ttlog Into the contentious subject of wbetber or not there  
are both "good" and •bad· ardlltects and graplllc designers, there  
certainly are practitioners wbo are concerned about wayllndlng,  
and those wbo are not. II ls our contention, of course, that tbe  
former can do a •better• job for the building owners than can the

By "better" we don't mean just prettier. We mean to Imply that  
the wsyllndlng component Is at last being seen as an essential \(and  
not just a peripheral or "nice to have"\) element in any building  
complex.  
In the commercial real-estate business, there are inOuentlal  
consultants wbose lunctlon Is lo advise their clients, from a totally  
independent perspective, whether a given building Is worth the  
renlal costB being charged for ii - or not. These consultants have  
developed over the years an extensive list of several hundred  
criteria on whlcb they base their evaluations of indMdual commer-  
cial buildings.  
Untll 1990, wsyfindlng was not one of these criteria. strange as  
ii may seem. But ii Is not really so strange wbeo taken In tbe  
context of "normal" building practice, which Is to hire a designer or  
sign company to "do" the signs just prior to opening day to provide  
a series of "grace-notes" for embeWBblng the building. 'Ibl8, how-  
ever, *it* last cl\>aogiog. W&yfinding \(In Its true sense\) Is now one of

Aller all, wbeo one comes to think of It, wily shouldn't It be vital  
ll'om a tenant's viewpoint that visitors should be able to  
• slngie out and ldeotlly tbe building itself from Its neighbor,  
• know bow and where to enter tbe bulldlng.  
• park their veblcles easily, and find their way back to them wbeo  
they have llnlsbed their business,  
• understand wbere they are In tbe bulldlng,

of their settings as a stereotyped, pbyslcally ftt, attentive  
Individual, wltb only one preoccupation - to explore and enjoy

62 8.1 User groups  
. The idea that there are user groups is in Itself a ra1r1y new one. in  
the "old days" \(whleh, in raet, by any other standard would be  
called recent\), we used to treat "users" as a single homogeneous  
group. Researehers, however, have known ror a long time that  
there is nothing homogeneous or u.nllorm about users or the built  
environment - particularly in terms or their abilities to asslmllate  
and proeess environmental ln!ormatlon.  
It is therefore time that we stopped designing !or some vague  
\(and imaginary\) abl\~bodJed ·user" and started to concern ow-  
selves with a much broader but more reallstlcally focused view o!  
user groups that are the ultimate consumers or everything that we  
design, build, fabricate, and Install.  
The accompanying definJUons give a short description ol the  
user groups to be considered In wayfinding design. Without doubt,  
It would be instructive to be able to attaeh precise numbers to each  
or tbese user groups. l. n this way we could develop some impressive  
statlstlcs In support or why we should be designing in order to  
satls!y the needs or all the people and not just some or them.  
Hard data, however, are virtually unobtainable. What we have  
tends to be unreliable and frequently contrad.iclory. ln!ormatlon on  
numbers or persons with multiple disabilities is even more dUlleult  
to get. l. n any ease, ststistics are not really the issue. Even a bum-  
ble statistic \(e.g .•. 05 percent ol the population\), when related to  
275 million people, is no mean statistic. It relates. in the ease or  
persons with speech impediments !or example. to 187, 500 persons  
in North America.

**A recent series or studies on mobility and wayfinding of the visu·**  
ally impaired and blind population round that only about half or the  
visually impaired population in the Montreal area consider large  
public buildings to be accessible to tbem. Tbe accessibility rate !or  
tbe blind population !alls to about 10 percent.'  
Interestingly enough, a wayfmding assessment study ol large  
public buildings found that tbe staff responsible !or tbe overall  
lunctioning ol tbe setting thought that blind people did not have  
any wayfmding dilliculties in their build.Ing because, as they ob-  
served, tbe blind nm·er come alone; they are always with a person  
who guides tbem. This vividly demonstrates tbat the plight of the  
sensory-impaired population ls still far !rom belng understood. Of  
course. It ls always much e&. sler to say that sometbing does not  
work, whUe It Is so much more dll!lcult to make It do so.  
In respect to tbe visually impaired and bUnd population one  
could ask what lnlormatlon Is needed ror their wayflndlng require-  
ments' and, even more Importantly, whether they need a specially  
designed environment In order to get around Independently. A  
specially designed environment can be justified only ii a particular  
user group \(such as the visually impaired or blind\) bas to engage  
in a special wayfinding process or has to rely on totally dilleront  
**environmental information in order to make and execute**  
wayfmding decisions. Research \(by Romedi Passini\) in the last rcw  
years bas been aimed at addre&&ing some ol these matter&.  
**Concerning the decision-making and decision-executing proc-**  
e&s, we round deeision plans ol tbe congenitally totally blind -who  
are tbe most handicapped group in tbe sense that they have never  
had a visual experience - to be quite similar in nature to those ol a  
sighted control group. They dilfered only in tbe sense that the bUnd  
group prepared for a Joumey In more detail and that during tbe  
journey, they also *made* more decisions than the sighted control  
group and used more environmental Information.  
This dlflereoce Is explained by the bUnd person's reduced  
distance perception. While a sighted person can actually see a  
destination. such as the end or a corridor, a blind person bas to  
**refer to a series of intermediate reference. points which he or she**  
**can perceive only by car or touch ..**  
# 3  
or course it can be, and has been. argued that a congenitally  
**blind person has no visual imagery and therefore is not able to**  
have any conception or space. It should be noted that the term  
**Original from**  
64 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN imagl?ry \(a common alternative to cognitive map\) has a distinct  
visual navor. In accordance with what Is called a deficiency theory,  
cognitive mapping of large spaces during wayfinding Is not possible  
for such people. This argument extends the perceptual hand.leap to  
that of a cognitive band.leap.  
**Numerous studies have, hOWC\\-er, shown that even a oongeni·**  
tally totally blind person is capable of reproducing a path learned  
in a wayfmd.lng experience.' We were able to correborate Ibis  
result and to show furthermore that the congenitally blind were  
also able to perform all of the spatio-oognitive operations neces·  
sary for wayfind.lng. They were able to learn a route and to invert it  
to reach the point of origin. 'They could combine learned routes into  
new journeys, learn a route on a small model, and then execute the  
journey in the actual setting. They could point to locations visited  
earlier on a journey, make shortcuts. and make spatial rotations to  
fit a non-allgned map with a setting. Finally, they could Identify  
spatial organizations, sucb as symmetries, in a real setting.'  
Blind travellers have to rely on auditory and tactlle cues. Only  
In rare circumstances can they use ollactory or beat perception. All  
of the senses compensating !or slgbt are generally less ln!ormatlve,  
less reliable, and less efficient. Nothing replaces slgbt In gaining a  
global understanding of the environment or In perceiving distant  
cues which are so Important !or wayflndlng.  
Hearing is the prime mode of perception !or the blind, but the  
objects composing our physical environment tend to be sUent. They  
become audible only through direct contact or reOectlng sounds.  
This in itself reduces the compensatory value of sound perception  
for the blind. 8 In addition, sound Is not as informative as sight. ft is  
often difficult to localize a sound source, especially if the cue is of  
short duration. Sounds work very weU as warning signals, how-  
ever; even a small cracking sound can have a startling effect.  
Even with its shortcomings, however, auditory perception is  
most Important to the mobile blind person and it has to be  
opllmlzed as mucb as possible. Background noise has to be coo·  
trolled as It is enemy number one of auditory perception.  
The blind person entering a public setting, sucb as a commer-  
cial or transportation center. often llnds 11 very dillicult to extract  
any useful Information from the generalized noise thal is so com-  
mon to these places. Background noise drowns auditory cues  
coming from an original sound source and renders ech\<\>locatlon  
Impossible. Background noise has also been described by blind  
people as having a g1?nerally disorienting effect. They observed  
that such noise makes walking In a straight line even more d.lffi·  
cult. The same is said for strong air currents, which are onen  
encountered at the entrances of underground subway systems.  
Public settings should be designed so that people, including the  
blind, can fmd their way around efficiently. A supplemeotsry  
service of personnel trained to guide blind travelers to their desti·  
nations will, however, always be appreciated. It is important to the  
blind person's autonomy to be able to reach a setting independ·  
ently. Once there, additional help for those who require it is a  
bonus.

liS Peroeptual lmpelrment  
To give verbal wayflndillg information to a blind person is not  
as easy as it might sound. II has boon our experience tbat it works  
much better the other way round. Blind people usually remember  
street names, and their descriptions of places arc often much  
clearer and more precise than are tbe descriptions given by the  
sighted. Quite apart from using visual cues, the sighted population  
puts less effort into understanding settings in order to get around,  
and this affec!B information giving' It is therefore suggested tbat  
training for people working in information booths include wayflnd-  
ing communication to the blind.  
The energy and attention required from a mobile blind traveler  
is enormous. Many blind people, when reaching middle age, feel  
drained of energy and exhausted by the tasks of wayfinding in  
**unfamiliar as well as in familiar environments. Even just rrom a**  
humane point of view, architects and graphic designers ought to  
take into consideration the needs of tbis population, both to facili-  
tate mobility and to reduce tbe risks or accidents.  
"Visual residue· Is a generic term that covers various visual  
handicaps. Individuals may have a low acuity of tbe whole visual  
field, such as blurred vision due to cataracts. They may peroelve  
only part or the visual neld. Some may experience "night blind-  
ness" In poorly illuminated settings. Some may be temporarily  
blinded lrom strong Ugh! contrasts.  
Certain design criteria can facilltate the perception of relevant  
wayflndillg information for the visually impaired, among the most  
important\:  
• The use or strong color and brightness contrasts In signage  
• The avoidance of contrasts as well as of glare In the general  
level or illumination  
• Visual and tactlle dennitlons or main circulation routes to set  
them apart from open areas  
• The pairing or visual with non-visual sensory lnlormatlon  
These criteria for lacilllating visual perception will also benefit the  
population at large and the elderly in particular.  
Up to this point, it could be argued that if a setting is well  
designed for tbe population in general, it will also work reasonably  
well for tbe visually impaired and blind population. We say ·rea-  
sonably well" because there are still some minor Interventions that  
will greatly benefit the blind population. Blind people, for example,  
have d.Ullcultles traversing large open spaces without some form of  
directional guide. They need warning signals In order not to coillde  
with obstacles or fall Into openings. These are, however, minor  
design lntel'\\'entlons and do not need to affect the overall design  
approach.

The wayllnding dll!iculties encountered by the hearing-Impaired  
population are not commonly known. Over I percent or the popula-  
tion uses hearing aids. They have two types or physical probl ems In  
public settings. The first is due to magnetlc interference; motors  
**Original l rom**  
66 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN **and transformers. for example, cause static interference, which**  
can render the use o! a hearing aid just about impossible. The  
other problem is caused by the difficulty in separating background  
noise from the desired message. The discrimination o! useful from  
**useless sounds is more difficult for those using a hearing aid.**  
A deaf person, in order to communicate, bas to rely on written  
messages, sign language. or lipreading. The last o! these would  
seem to be most used when obtaining information from a non-deaf  
person. Lipreading can be made difficult by insufficient lighting or  
by the physical and behavioral Idiosyncrasies o! the person giving  
the Information.  
Some o! the deaf mlgbt have dlfOeulties understanding the  
sense o! spoken and written words. Their vocabulary tends to be  
more action oriented. Ab\<ltractlons and words describing concepts  
may not be readily understood. The common saying tbst it is worse  
to be deal than to be blind \(although who would want to have to  
choose?\) is rooted in the difficulty not only o! communicating but  
also o! understanding. It should be noted. however, that a study  
comparing the spatial understanding o! deal and non-deal people  
demonstrated that the deal had a *better* spatial knowledge than  
the non-impaired control group.'  
One of the major problems common to all handicapped groups,  
including the deaf, iB o! a psychological nature. Some people !eel  
ashamed o! their handicap or find the emotional effort to get infor-  
mation too great for the reward. A concerted effort on the design  
and educational sides will probably lead to a reduction in the  
problem. Confidence is built up over time by the feedback o! re-  
warding experiences. Wayflnding design can contribute to the  
reinforcing effect and thus affect the well-being o! everyone.  
**8.4** Cognlttve **lmpalnnent**  
Cognitive Impairments, again. range from temporary confusion  
due to Information overload or stress, to more or less severe  
incapacities which can be due to disease, accident, age, or mental  
retardation. Cognitive Impairment can a!lect linguistic abWtles  
independently from spatial abWties.  
The nature and the gravity o! the Impairments are too diverse  
to be covered within the lramll""Ork o! this book.  
This category includes persons who, by reason o! their psychologi-  
cal state, may experience difficulties in processing environmental  
Information and making appropriate wayfinding decisions besides  
those directly related to vision, hearing, or literacy.  
Everybody by virtue o! being human is "situationally impaired"  
at one time or another. People who are visiting public buildings  
by reason o! being unemployed or having their taxes straightened  
out may be more likely to be distracted or distressed by their  
anger. confusion, or apprehension. A particularly important issue  
**is possible situational** im\~ent **as a** \~ult **of stress, as it** Digitized by **\\...\:JOOgte Original from**

**For whom do we plan7**  
8.4 Cognitive impairment  
might be experienced when f8Allng danger or when having to  
evaA\:Uate a setting during an emergency.  
Digitized by **Google**  
Development refers to the whole life span. Its impairment may  
affect the learniJ\:1g abilities of the young child or result In tbe loss  
of cognitive abilities in the elderly.  
Most people have beard about dyslexia. However, the full range  
of learning disabilities is very much larger than that, Including the  
impairment of the ability to calculate or do math, dysgraphla  
\(impairment of the ability to write\), and a host of other conditions,  
some of which \(such as difficulty In le!Vrigbt discrimination\) have a  
direct bearing on our subject, while others do not.  
Estlmates on the number of learning-\<llsabled persons gn as  
high as one In ten; however, 8AlCurate figures are lmposslble to  
obtain because many learning disabilities are never IWOgnlzed as  
such, and few people acknowledge that they have them.  
**Dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and related disorders**  
affect an important section of the elderly population. It is estimated  
that approximately I percent of North Americans sutler lrom de-  
mentia wb.ich is considered to be the fourth leading cause of death.  
Alzheimer's ls an Irreversible degenerative disease of the brain  
which dlsables various cognitive functions at dlllerent rates.• Some  
of its earllest manllestatlons are contusion, memory loss, and dis-  
orientation with respect to tlme and space. Alzbelmer's patients  
tend to forget recent 0\\'llnta wbUe keeping some or their longterm  
memory. They tend to wander and easily get lost. Wandering is  
particular to Alzheimer's. Gllleard \(1984\) identified throe causes\:  
8Altivity seeking, habitual walking behavior, and disorientation.  
What is the cause of disorientation? Some researchers explain  
it as a general loss of memory and cognitive abilities; others as-  
sume that the degeneration ls selectlve and that the spatial abili-  
ties are particularly prone.  
Among the spatio-cognitive abilities, It Is those requiring  
higher-order representations that are struck fll'SI. Alzheimer's  
patients may still be able to operate efficiently, although at a more  
**elementary level It is also assumed that Alzheimer's patients are**  
not able to process bigll levels of information. II they do operate at  
the limits of their capacities. they can experience stress and over-  
load.  
The therapeutic objective In Institutions, on the other band, Is  
to support the bighest 10\\ • el or functional utility In order to rein-  
force competence and sell esteem. These considerations point to  
an optimal middle ground in which the environment is stimulating  
**without being overbearing. Alzheimer's patients seem to require a**  
**specialized environment. which. as we have indicated, can have**  
therapeutic !unctions. For example, rather then trying to eliminate  
wandering, lbe provision of sale and well.\<felined wandering paths  
has been suggl!flled.'  
In order to f8AlWtate wayflndlng, the design or a setting should  
include clearly defined paths t 3 , 1gn 1 \~\~Y!Ws and should lncorp\<\>-  
68 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN rate striking landmarks. Visual accessibility of tbe site itself ls also  
important. In planning the wayfinding concept, additional design  
Ideas should be Introduced on an experimental basis. in order to  
rscWtate tbe wayflndlng task, the designers should attempt to  
*r* reduce the number or decisions along the patbs and, even more  
•. importantly, tbey should provide environmental Information that  
does not require higher-order manipulations.  
8.5 ll!!teracy  
Many more people are runct!onally illiterate tban one would like to  
think. Hard statlstlcs based on actual ability are virtually impossi-  
ble to obtain because !Wteracy, in our society, ls generally consld·  
ered a shameful subject.  
11 we describe a person who cannot read and write sufficiently  
well to fill a job application as illiterate, we may estimate the  
illiteracy rate at 20 percent. Typographic signs are by no means  
completely useless to this group. Many of them are able to read a  
Utt!e, or at least to recognize certain key words from tbeir shape or  
their llrst letter.  
We all are !Wlerate In some ways and In some situations. II we  
expand the meaning or !Wteracy to Include an Inability to read a  
written messagll in a given language, we have to Include In tbe  
illiterate group anybody visiting a foreign country who does not  
speak its language and we also have to include clllldreo or pre-  
school age.  
Symbols and pictographs are the obvious alternative to written  
messages. They have demonstrated tbeir usefulness in coping with  
International visitors In settings such as world fairs, airports, and  
public transport terminals - provided tbeir content is limited to  
very simple concepts such as washrooms, phones. or baggage  
# claims.  
Pictorial languagll. like any other. bas to be based on a set or  
recognized elements, and this implies a certain level of standardl-  
zatlon or content. For years, European railway stations have used  
the same sort of pictographs to identi/y baggage claims, money  
exch\~. waiting rooms, and otber faellities. These signs are now  
well understood by everyone and they are as effective as verbal  
descriptions.  
Symbols and pictographs also have their shortcomlngs, how-  
0\\'cr. There are limits on what can be described or ldentll!ed In a  
pictograph and tbere is also a limit to the number of dlflereot  
pictographs tbat can be used In a sign. This issue is discussed In  
rurther detail In Chapter 13.  
As observed earlier. we are all likely to find ourselves functionally  
!Wterate at one tlme or another. Visiting a loreign country is one  
of them; living In an ofllclally bilingual country like Canada is  
Digitized by Google **During a recent visit to Japan, I \(Romedl**  
**Passini\) was made painfully aware of what it**  
**means not to be able to rely on written**  
**messages. Looking for a railway station, for**  
**example. I could read neither the directional**  
**s igns leading to it nor the inwiption identi·**  
**tying it. I had to rety on features of land·**  
**sc.aping and on the architecture of the**  
**buildings.** So\~ **buildings expressed** t\~ir  
**function quite clearly, while othen did not**  
**even arouse any suspicion of their being**  
**railway stations.**  
**Architectural language becomes one of the**  
**major means of communication for the**  
# Illiterate wayfinder.  
**Japan is a wry well-organited country.**  
**Having traveled by train for ten days, I**  
**discovered punctuality and found the trains**  
**to be so reliable that all I needed to know**  
**for boarding was the time and the platform**  
**of departure. Arriving at the destinatkm was**  
**e-ven easier. The time table and a watch**  
**were all I needed. This works *only* if the**  
**traveler finds a reliable alternative to the**  
**unreadable written messages. I don't sug.**

**in North America on such a basis.**

8.7 M8"ro- and mk\:ro-appro60h .. to pl&nnlng  
'Ibe macro-approacb assures a blgber overall standard or  
planning; moreover, it does not create artificial barriers between  
populalion groups and does not ostracize the handicapped.  
'Ibe design ol accessible and sale settlng8 is now a political  
issue. It is only tbanks to pressure groups, spearheaded by wheel-  
chair users In the early 70.., that the population as a whole and  
politicians In particular have been made aware ol the issue.  
From the political point or view, the macro-approach would  
seem to be more acceptable than the micro. It Is always easier to  
ask !or a provision that benefits the populalion as a whole than to  
ask !or one that benefits only a speclllc group because. even II that  
group bas every right to make such a NOquest, it tends to be pe"  
ce!ved as a special lavor.  
The macro-approach to planning does not preclude small  
adjustments when they are needed. Althougb planning standards  
should be based on the N!QUirements ol the population as a wboie,  
**circumstances may require that minor interventions be initiated**  
!or a given disabled population.  
In line with our own support !or tbe macro-approach, the  
authors have chosen not to write a special chapter on "way!lnding  
and the disabled population.• Rather, we Incorporate references to  
their normal and some or their specillc N!Qulrements In the body or

·.--eatlonal" conditions can be conaklem to be mutually exclu·  
slve. The actual conditions at a given time may be one or tbe other.  
but in the planning and de8fiD or a setting the des!per cannot opt  
**tor one o'f·er tbe other.**  
For rucample, t&ke something as purely "utilitarian· aa a htgb-

has tbe sole objective of getting there last, *a. nd* the lamlly, who  
wants to get out to explore the beauties ol the local oounlryalde. Or  
take something that aooms, at first, to be at the other end ol the  
scale\: a park or a zoological garden. These recreational raeWtles  
must also be planned to acoommodate both oondltlona. Visitor• to a  
zoo may havo oomo lor a day's \(or an altornoon's\) outing with no  
particular aim In ml. nd cxoopt to enjoy themselves. On tho other  
band, som e vlallors may have very definite ideas in mind. Thoy  
want to 600 the polar hears, lor example. They will be most dlaap-  
poinled ii, at tho end ol their stay, they still haven·t lound them.  
We ahould DO more plan a system \(or the use o\( the gl\)Dcral

# 9.2 Emergency oondltlons  
**It is commonly assumed that in serious emergency situations**  
people wiU panic. Jonathan Sime, who bas done extensive researeb  
on peoples' behavior in fire. bas determined that this assumption Is  
basically wrong.  
Investigating the behavior Of people who bad SW'\\1Ved fires,  
Sime round that they wnded to behave In a controlled and rational  
way - as long as they had a hope or getting out and being saved.  
**The rationale ror their behavior was not necessarily that or the**  
planning arebitect or the lire marshal. but of people who bad to  
deal with w hatever information they bad about the building. It is  
no\~ therefore. a sign of irrationality that they wnd lo move along  
previously experienced routes and to i8J!ore nre exits.'  
Any rire marshal wiU confirm the fact that the sln8!e most  
Important !actor in saving people's lives In a fire Is time. Through  
the production or combustible \(and toxic\) gases, fires expand lo  
leaps and bounds. Seconds may make all the dilference between  
life and death. Therefore. to delay the announcement or a fire in a  
public building for fear that people wiU panic is not only ill advised.  
but irresponsible.  
Panic is not usually part of wayfmding behavior in eme'll"n·  
**cies. However, streSB is, and stress does affect performance in one**  
ol two ways. Depending on the context and the level ol stress.  
stress can either reduce or improve performance.'  
II stress leads to a b1gb level of anxiety, the ellect always tends  
to be negative.• Worrying also consumes energy. Psychological and  
cognitive resourees have to be allocated to deal with anxiety. and  
**these resources are therefore. not available for wayfmding.**  
**Furthermore, information that is processed to control anxiety**  
**may compete with the relevant wayfinding information, thus creat-**  
**ing a condition similar to that of overload. Thus, e'°·en if informa-**  
tion were available. a person migbt not be able to absorb it.  
Consistency lo the form and location ol environmental communica-  
tion is the best way to reduce overload.  
Stress can be caused by the pereepllon or danger \(for example  
the sight or smoke\), by time constraints, and by uncertainty. The  
**danger may be real and the time limitations important.**  
**The only cause of stress that can be reduced is uncertainty.**  
Uncertainty about the person's safety is reduced by keeping people  
informed of the nature and location of the danger. Uncertainty  
about escape can be reduced by providing the necessary  
wayfinding Information. Information ls the best means of lessening  
stress.  
The overall knowledge people ha"e about the spatial character-  
istics or the setting with its entrances and exits will probably be  
**their most valuable information. If the setting is well understood by**  
**the users - that is, if they have a clear cognitive map, they will not**  
**only have all the decision-making information at their disposal,**  
**Original from**  
80 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN they will also be able to develop alternative options should a par-  
tleular exit turn out to be barred by hazards.  
Fire drills. Intended to lamlllarlze people with eecape proc&-  
dures, also make them lamlllar with llNl exits In the building. This  
advantage bas to be counterbalanced by the progresalve loss or  
elfec\:tivenesa of tho llre alarm throug!l repealed drills. People may  
mistake an emergency slluallon for a drill and decide that they  
ba,.., more important things to do. Orllll, lurthennore, can onty be  
used in a setting tbal hou- permanent emplo\~ or reatdent.s. lt  
would be dillicult Indeed to Imagine a lire drill In a department  
store or in a Large shopping complex.

people in a building can be adequately wanied or an emerg1\>ncy  
and ba,,, the informallon al their d1spoe&I tbal wiJI enable them to  
make - and execute - appropriate wayllndlng decisions.  
Complex settings, 0\\'90 *U* they are .,..,u deelped In terms of  
wayfindlng and have the nece81&1\)1 pl'OY!&lons for the disabled  
population, still need a plan !or evacuation. Large eenlngs usually  
bave lire o!llcera In realdenoe who are responsible for eY11CUallon.  
In some countrtee. such aa the U nited Kingdom, great lmpor-  
tanoe Is given to assisted escape. Certain OCC11pant1 of a eettlng  
will be assigned the responsib1llty of helping an Impaired fellow  
worker to eecape. Sime and Gartshore, for example. analyzed the  
time required to evacuate a wbeelebalr user through a stairway  
and have commented on the Interfercooe this bas with evacuallon  
in general.'  
Several European countries \(France and Italy. to name two\)  
noqulre the frequent and prominent display or *\(/Teen* \(note the  
color!\) "Sale exll arrows" In all public spaoea - from department  
stores to museums to hotel corridors. These point to the closest  
exit from the building.  
To sum up\: In terms of cmcr\~ncy wayflndlng, Information Is  
the answer. II can reduce anxiety, and It can reduce the elloet.s of  
overload. Finally, Information can lead to more elficlcnt cseape  
behavior. However, an Important point should be made here\: we do  
not need more information \(certainty not more signs\). We do,  
however, need lnlormatlon that is more aocurate and relevant to  
waylindlng.  
Settings should be planned with all th. roe \~lndlng conditions  
- normal, rec\:reallonal, and emcr\~ncy - In mind, and apec\:lal es-  
cape routes should be eliminated or kept to a minimum. *U* a setting

**Original from**  
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 10.1 The process of planning a layout  
Seen lrom a wayfinding perspective, three phases or spatial plan-  
ning stand out\:  
• Identification ol the consliluent spatial units  
• **Grouping of spatial units into destination zones**  
• Organization and linkage ol units and zones  
Whether planning a new setting or renovating an existing  
tayoul, lhe process is similar, although the relative importance or  
each phase varies according lo the extent or the intervention.  
Planners are usually given a design program which spectlies the  
g\<meral aims and objeetivea or a building as well as its content. The  
content is expressed in terms or gl!neral and speeUlc runctlons. For  
each function, a spatial area is defined and perlormance speclfica-  
lions are outlined, such as the control or Ugbting, temperature,  
desired levels or social Interactions, and ambiance. Wayfinding,  
unfortunately. is rarely Included in performance specifications  
although It certainly is a !unction - one that should not he ignored.  
People finding their way in complex settings will try lo under-  
stand what the setting contains and how ii is organized. In order to  
lorm a mental map or the setting, Ibey have lo identify things to  
map. Among the basic building blocks or cognitive mapping are  
spatial entities. People can only map these spatial entitles ii they  
are distinct, ii they have an identity that distinguishes them lrom  
surrounding spaces.  
Slmilarly. decision making can only be sustained ii destinations  
and lntennedlate sul\>\<lestinallons have an identity distinguishing  
them ll'om other places. The same applies to decision execution. A  
plaoe bas to he recognized before a decision can he transformed into  
behavior. Distinctiveness giving phwes their identity is, thus, a major  
requirement lor waylindlng. This can be achieved by the lorm and  
volume ol the space that delioos srebilOOlural and decorative elements  
and by the use o/ finishes, light. colors. and graphics.  
A rather curious example or distinctiveness Is the house within  
the house or the arehlteetural museum in Frankfurt \(seep. 86\). The  
house within takes on a particular meaning by Its surprise value. It  
also symbolizes the elementary habitat which can he seen as the  
souree or architecture. Meaning and symbolic expression clearly  
**reinforce distinctiveness.**  
Activities and the atmosphere created by people's behavior can  
create a form ol distinctiveness. Although this may be a strong  
!actor to which people are sensitive, it has the disadvantage or not  
being permanent - or disappearing v.1th the now or the key occu-  
pants.Open-air markets. lor example. can give a very strong sense  
or distinctiveness to an urban square or street for the lime of their  
occupation. Once the stands are taken away, however, the square  
might not be reeogni1.able to the casual visitor.

Digitized by Google  
**In the second phase of the planning process. similar functjons tend**  
to be grouped together according to the following rationales\:  
• **The need for human contact or privacy**  
• **The necessity for information exchange**  
• The sharing or certain services  
**This basic grouping in respect to functions establishes a pri-**  
mary order in a complex setting. The bubble diagram and its deri-  
vations are traditional tools for establishing this functional order  
among the required facilities.  
Let us now sl!p into the way!inding shoes or some potential  
users. When visiting a setting, users do not think in terms or lune.  
lions, nor do they have access to a bubble diagram. Users think or  
destinations and see them as specUlc faellllles - a particular omce,  
**a t\)'\)\>C of shop, the washrooms, or \\\\rhatever. Each individual space**  
**in a setting is a potential destination.**  
**Any complex setting has a great number of destinations, and if**  
**it "'·ere not for the grouping of similar destinations into zones it**  
would be very difficult !or people to !ind their way. J ust imagine a  
building, such as a hospital. in which each room was allocated by  
chance. Clearly It would be total chaos. and even With the most  
**Original from**  
86 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN sopblstlcated lnlormation system it would be impossible to guide  
stall, patients, and visitors to their destinations.  
Destination zones operate at dlllerent levels. Let us introduce  
this notion with the help ol an everyday example\: a person shop-  
ping tor a particular food item in an urban context. In order to buy,  
**let's be extravagant, a rare Russian caviar in a complex multi-**  
purpose downtown facility, the person will probably consider the  
shopping area as a fll'St destination zone which distinguishes itself  
from other zones such as office or residential. Within the shopping  
zone, the person will look for a sul\>-zone that groups food products,  
tor example, a supermarket. Even at that level we can consider the  
speciallty counter to be a sul\>-zone of the supermarket. Destination  
zones are therefore composed of sul\>-destlnatlon zones which are  
In tum composed of sul\>-sul\>-destlnation zones.  
Tbe proper articulation of destination zones affects wayfmding  
in two ways. It facilitates the cognitive mapping process by empha-  
sizing the spatial units to be mapped, and it supports the decision-  
making proce88. Looking at decision diagrams, we fmd that in  
complex buildings, "to reach a major destination zone" Is a higbel"  
# order decision.  
It is crucial that waylinders be able to ldentily certain spatial  
characteristics that allow them to group destinations Into zones.  
Like any other grouping or classification, two foroes are at work\:  
Identity and equivalence.  
*/Mntit11.* as we have already outlined, is the characteristic that  
allows us to differentiate one space from another. *Equivalence* is  
**the characteristic th.at allows us to group them into zones along**  
**some common traits. In order to distinguish one destination zone**  
from another, the zones must have distinct features, but the spatial  
units within a zone have to have some common characteristics.  
Tbe spaces needed for a particular function usually share  
certain physical characteristics. All shops, for example, have  
something In common. By grouping spaces according to their  
!unctions, the designer creates destination zones which distinguish  
themsel,·es from other zones.  
Large unifunctional settings, on the other hand, may not have  
**distinguishable destination zones. Visitors tend to be faced with**  
almost insurmountable difficulties In mapping the setting because  
everything looks more or Jess the same. U niformity does not favor  
decision making.  
In a previous chapter we said that spatial planning sets the  
stage for w&\)11nding. The truth of this statement ls brought out  
again. The development of an adequate slgnage system depends on  
a clear ldent1Hcatlon of destination zones. Where else can you  
direct people?  
**In some large commercial complexes. designers have success-**  
**fully introduced .. artificial .. destination zones by giving each zone**  
a particular character that is not ne\<.'essarily related to Its !Unc-  
tion. Metro Centre in Newcastle, England, with Its "three miles or  
spacious shopping malls." over 350 shops. and •tree parking for  
10, 000 cars." Is one of the world's largest commercial complexes.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN The le&p, metaphorically speaking, can go In one or two dJtoo.  
Ilona. It can take oil from the circulation system and end up with  
an overall form, or It can atarl with the form and end up with the  
clrelllatlon system. Wblchever way, form and drculallon are  
cJoeely related.  
In ""'peel lo wayfindlng. the form or a building'• volume la  
particularly lnstruClh-e. It provides the users with cues about the  
internal organization and the circulalion system.  
Underground aetllllgll, because they lack an accessible exterior  
form. are mown to be dlllicult to map even when their lntemal  
organization Is relatively simple. Exterior form gives a setting an  
objeetUke quallly, whlch la easy to grasp and to retain. Even the  
names of famoua buUdlngs such aa the Empire State Bulkllng In  
New York or St Peter'• In Rome Immediately evoke ob\)ectllke  
Imagos. Tho Issue of providing the user with adequate Information  
tbrougb the form of the setting 18 dlseusaoo In Chapter t t, Arcbl·  
tectural Wayftndlng Communication.  
The circulation Is, without doubt, the key organizing loroe or a  
layout. W e Uke to think of the circulation system as the bone struo-  
ture of a aetllng. The bone structure iB the organizing feature or a  
body. The clreulatlon system iB equally determining for the layout  
ol the aettln\~  
A bone structure 18 ai.o very ln!ormatn-e. By looldog at the  
skeletons of *dlnoaun* In a paleontology museum we can uaually  
determine much about wllat the animals looked Uke, bow they IDO\\'ed, what they ate, and IO on. Slmllarly, if we understand the "  
ciroWatlon system, we can also understand the spatial organlza·  
tion of the setting and !ta architecture.  
The clrelllatlon system la also the space in wbJch people move  
and In wblcb they have to find their way. Thus It 18 tbJa apace that  
we try to understand and It la In this apace that we have to make  
our wayfindlng deelalona.  
In tbe foUowlng section we present an overview of the basic  
types or clreulatlon systems and their related spatial organization.  
This will serve as a basis for dlseusslng the features that mako  
these organizations wayfindlng-lrleodly.

idenlltics lo various parts or the site.  
The corridor in the Baker House, designed by Alvar Aalto !or  
MIT, ls not a purely random path. although ii mlghl be perooived as  
such by some users. The building rorm on one side clearly ex·  
presses the rorm or the single corridor, wblch reln.loroes ils \~tall

would be much more dlmcult to understand.

The core Is also a single path although it bas a more clearly ex·

gives a certain Importance to lhe selttng. It Is not only a c\:i.rculatlon

canyonlike space. This is clearly the backbone or the setting. The  
regularly placed staireases reinloroo the core Idea. The rorm or the

10.3 Circulation patterns and wayftnding  
Each o! the lour types o! circulation systems bas features that  
make it -yfinding-!riendly.  
In this section, we identlly the features that make circulation  
systems easier to map and that !acllitate decision maktng and  
decision execution. Both cognitive mapping and decision maktng  
are allected by the patterns or the circulation systems. These  
patterns have been Identified as follows\:  
• Shoestring  
• Gestalt  
• Systematized  
• Network or repetitive pattern  
**The shoestring pattern. which is based on a random or a quasi ..**  
random distribution, does not have an underlying organizational  
principle. Users would be ill advised to searcb !or something that iB  
not there.  
Mapping **a** sboeatrlng  
Rooallln,g that cognitive mapping ls, by de!lnltlon, a prooess of  
organizing spaces, one may wonder whether people can actually  
map a shoestring arrangement. The answer is that they can. Peo-  
ple are able to map these random arrangements, within certain  
limits, with respect to their size and complexity.  
Probably the most efficient strategy is lo lake note o! land·  
marke and use them as mental anchors. These anchors can then  
**Major events in a** \~rson·s **life are used as**  
**anchor points in time. Most people can**  
**remember even minor things th1t happened**  
**just before or just after major events.**

10.3 Circulation patterns and wayfindlng  
serve to attach segments of the route and the surrounding space.  
Anchor points in wayfinding can be distinctive physical features,  
events. and or distinct destination zones.  
Distinctiveness, we have seen. can be acltie\>·ed by outstanding  
features and by compositional characteristics. The repetitions or  
spaces or architectural features, their rbythmlc arrangements, and  
other proportional relationships can be considered distinctive and  
thus gain anchor-point quality.  
\~fcmorable **features or events are not necessarily the same for**  
everybody; what may be a landmark for one person may not for  
another. Again. it is by planning with redundancy that communica·  
**lion will be most effective.**  
**In many cases a path *i.s* structured, but for a variety of rea·**  
sons having to do with the architecture or with the stale of mind  
of the user, the structure is not perceived. In such a case it is  
Weglble. The user will see the path as a shoestring and wW revert  
to the anchor-point technique In attempting to understand and  
cope with It.  
W e therefore recommend that anchor points be Introduced as  
a failsafe device even In the best-planned settings to allow for the  
eventuality that the circulation pattern may *not* be perceived.  
**Mapping 11 scatter**  
# networ\\.  
**The scatter network bas no discernible organization and is**  
therefore very dillicult to map. Users have no choice other than to  
map the routes Independently. Given that the routes are or the  
shoestring type, anchor points become tbe cognitive structuring  
information.  
This cognltive strategy has limits. as can easily be seen from  
**the c. rowded impNmsion gi\\•en in the illustration. In a complex**  
**scatter-point network it remains quite possible to map certain**  
paths, but not the whole network.

Deciding within a shoestring pattern  
The decision-related processes are based on information. It Is  
therefore not surprising to find a close link betv.·een cognitive  
mapping and decision maldng. . .

!actors are symmetries and other regularities in composition.  
It must be realized, however, that the wayfmding public rarely  
sees the overall form ol the paths. Quite the contrary. The Gestalt  
bas to be mentally constructed from partial views.  
Even a form as complex as that or a running figure Is grasped -  
and communicated - mainly through lines and Joints. In buildings  
with Gestalt-type organizations, It l6 suaoested that designers  
emphasize straight or curved lines and, In particular, junctions *or*  
joints or the form.

The large shopping center in the illustration Is an axial ar-  
rangement. It Is easily mapped, but It also SUJ!l!'lStS the drawback  
o! symmetrical arr&llg'!ments. Although you may get an overall  
image or the setting's layout without dlffleulty, you may just as  
easUy mix up your position in spaoo. You may know that you are in  
a wing but the question as to which one may go unanswered.  
The symmetrical layout ol Saint Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee  
**must have disoriented more than an occasional visitor. The plan**  
bas no distinguishing features, not even a reference *to* the outside.  
In orgsnizations with central symmetry or rotations, It Is  
important *to* provide wayfinders with some dlstlnct features that  
will allow them to situate themselves In the setting. A uniform  
circular or splral path Is sure to get people disoriented. Although  
the central organizations are generally understood in themselves,  
**they can lead to confusions in orientation.**

can serve **u** cognitive anehor polnta. Tbeae are essential !or both  
the cognltlve mapping and the decisioo·maklng procesoea.  
Patterns that *do* renect an organizational principle al80 !all  
Into two type11\: those that are organized by a geometric lorm \(Ge-  
stalt pattern\) and those that are orgaoJud by a geometric law  
\(syalomat11,ed patlern and ordered repelllive pallerns\).  
Layouts based on the Gestalt pattern have lo be relalively  
simple in order lo be perceived as a lorm. From an Interior per-  
spective, II la Important to emphasize the joints of the circulation  
lorm, and !tom the exterior, the corresponding configuration of the  
setting. Mape and other dlsplays that can commuoicale the lorm of  
the circul&Uon and the bulldJng are or particular Importance hett.  
In the event the lorm la not perceived, the joints can aen-e aa  
anehor points and the user can revert lo a *shoestring* strategy.  
Layouts based on **a** geometric law will be simple !or cognitive  
mapping and decUlon maldog only if Ibis law is perceived and  
understood by the users.  
The pattern• or symmetrical layouts tend to be easily under-  
stood and mapped, but In such settings, situating oneself,  
-yl!Ddlng, and doctslon making may all be more dilf'1cull. In larflll  
and complex symmetrical layouts, difficulties can be reduced by  
lnlrcduclng unique landmarks *to* serve two aims\: to allow users lo  
dlstlngulsh one side !rem the other and, if everythln,g else lallll. lo  
serve as anchor points.

10.4 P1annlng the layout\: a summary  
The scatter-point network Is composed or shoestring patterns  
and can be undentood only on tbe basis ol anchor points. In a  
network, anchor points should coincide with Intersections. This  
might, in certain cases, lacilita.te a partial understanding In Gestalt  
segments. It must be said clearly, however, tbat random networks  
are bard to cope wilb.  
Grid networks reOect a recurring geometric pattern. The  
orthogonal Is the most common grid and is known to be easily  
pereelved and understood. Combined with coordinates, it estab-  
lishes an elllclent addr\<!ss system which is reOected In the decision  
plans of the users.  
Hierarchical networks are less constraining In form than the  
grid. Care, however, bas to be taken to communicate the underly-  
ing organizational principle.  
The layout of a setting has a strong influence on wayfindlng. 01  
course. there is no *ideal* circulation system. What is best for any  
given setting will depend on the function of the setting, its size, and  
Its environmental context. But !or each system a structuring order  
and/or structuring information has to be expressed so that mem·  
bers ol tbe wayllndlng public can develop their decision plans and  
can thus map tbe setting cognitively.  
The following table Usts tbe organizational patterns and their  
representative cireulatlon types. It also summarizes the structur-  
ing order and the information that makes them viable.

**Architectural w ayfinding communication**  
Many .-i\>le thl.n.k that signs are tbe DIO\$t Important means of  
provldlog wayllndlng lnlormatlon In an wban or architectural  
setting. Without downp\~g the Importance of signs, It Is  
nevertheless easy to show that the natural and built environ-  
ments provide the\~ person with a gTeal variety of  
basic wayllndlng cues.  
*U* you see a road you understand that you can walk along It  
without having to see **a** sign saying that you can do so. You can  
enter a buUdtng through a doorway even *U* It Is without an  
entrance sign. You may even know wbal Is In the bulldtng and  
bow It Is spatially organized Just by looking at It. You can use  
**a nature trail, a park, a square, an avenue, an elevator, or a**  
stair, because wayllndlng lnlormatlon Is contained In these  
elements.  
People In their daUy movements have to pick up circulation  
Information In order to ftnd their way. 'Ibey have to Dnd out  
where to enter a setting and where to exit It. They have to re-  
cognize destinations. They have to Identify the paths of hori-  
zontal and vertical circulation systems. To be fully emclent,  
**they have to understand clrculatlon systems.**  
This chapter Is about arcbltectural wayll.ndtng oommu.nlca-  
tlon. I t outlines the architectural features that deftne the  
circulation and It proposes means to oommu.nlcate the relevant  
wayllndlng Information.

How does the building itself communicate the location or the en-  
trance? If the form of the building layout can be grasped, the  
**viewer may already have some cues about the main entrance.**  
Symmetrical layouts have a long tradition in public buildings  
**and houses of worship.2 The layout is usually perceived without**  
dirliculty and the assumption is Lbat the entrance will be found in  
the axis of the bilateral symmetry \(see illustration I . opposite\).  
Asymmetrical layouts are generally more dlf!icult to interpret.  
Their form requires some special features to distinguish the en-  
tranoo \(compare layouts or Ulustratlors 2 and 3\). Buildings with

**Out-patient entrance**  
**to a large hospital,**  
# --  
# '  
-·l,. --  
\\  
# '  
# -\) \>  
A major hospital in Montreal has one ent rance that looks like a  
**small service. entrance. It is small, but it is certainly not a service**  
**entrance. It is the most direct and most used e-ntrance for out-**  
patients in the hospital, with about a hundred people an hour  
**entering and exiting. Both architectural and graphic communica-**  
tion are almost totally absent. Needless to say, the entrance is  
notoriously bard to !ind.  
The cues indicating the location or a gate or an entrance are  
mainly visual. The blind visitor, having no visual access to the  
building volume or Its ra\~ade, wlll not be able to perceive the archl·  
tectural treatment or the door either. The cues the blind will be  
able to perceive, thererore, will be so much more important to  
**them. A recess. an overhang, landscape features, a decorative**  
**articulation of the entrance. the use of different textures - these**  
arc all cues that can be picked up by the visually impaired.  
In addit.ion, directional guidance can be given by disling\\tisbing  
the access pa th rrom the surrounding area. This may be achie"ed  
through texture or by a guiding shore line. It must be noted that a  
well-articulated path usually has these distinguishing characteris-  
tics In any case. The designer just has to be careful that these cues  
are not exclusively visual.  
Entrances to certain buildings may also be marked by a sound  
**source. This directional cue can be** *\\rery* **efficient as long as it is not**  
drowned out by background noises. It is, or course, nol feasible to  
**have all entrances marked b.\>• a sound; but the solution is a reason·**  
able one !or buildings tha t are frequently used by the visually  
impaired population.  
Sound sources have been designed to be activated by a small  
pocket-size device. This is an interesting solution to elimlnale  
competing sounds and the possible nuisance value or permanent  
sound.  
**The problem of entrances is quite typical in**  
**this hospital. When the hospital was ex-**  
**panded, existing and new buildings were**  
**linked together. The administration has not**  
**been able to decide whether to organize the**  
**hospital as one complel\(. with a main en-**  
**trance, or as a number of semi-autonomous**  
**sections, each with its own entrance. The**  
**situation shown reflects that ambiguity.**  
11.2 Exits  
**The. exit of a buildin g requires particular consideration. Although**  
**it is the same architectural element as an entrance. from the user's**  
**point of view it is certainly not seen the same way. The perception**  
or the exit is olten limited to the actual doors and most or the t ime  
they are seen only a t short range. Exits are important when way-  
fmding- they represent sulH!estinations when people arc leaving  
a setting.  
Digitized by Google  
The wa\)11ndlng tasks or reaching an e ntrance arc quite different  
rrom those !or an exit. For the unJamiliar visitor, the entrance has  
first to be found, while the exit in most settings requires a simple  
return to the point or entry. IC people are able to map their en·  
**trance route, they will require only limited environmental inform.a·**  
**tion to return to the exit. In a recent wayfinding experiment in a**  
labyrinth, we were able to show that most people were able to point

11.2 Exits  
**Besides, it may just be a false alarm, we**  
**convince ourselves.**  
Familiarizing people witb emergency exit routes througb flre  
drills is an option that may work !or some settings but not !or  
others. While it is possible to have fire drills in office buildings, it  
would be virtually impossible to do the same in a large shopping  
complex or an airport. Furthermore, fire drills, like all drills, are a  
nuisance, and people cannot be blamed it they ignore them, al-  
though this attitude might lead to truly catastrophic consequences  
in a real fire.  
A more efficient and elegant solution In public buUdlngs that  
cupe with a high volume or visitors ls to design a number of normal  
entrances/exits which are used In both senses under normal oondi-  
tloos. There Is no reason wby buildings cannot be designed in  
these terms and at the same lime respect constraints imposed by  
security and maintenance. This might be more difficult when  
retrofllling an existing structure, but there Is no doubl that a good  
argument can be made that the security or people *in* the building  
might jusl be more important than lhe security *of* the building.  
The direct peroeplion or exits lrom the inside is only possible lo  
settings with large open spaces such as shopping malls, airports,  
and stadia. The argument here Is to do away with the notlon of fire  
exits as much as possible wbUe still respecting the satety require-  
ments or having alternatlve escape routes.  
**11.3 Paths**  
**In discussing wayfinding communication related lo paths, we**  
should distinguish between two aspects\:  
• Pereeptlon or a path, Its use. and Its accessibility  
• Understanding the oonliguration or the circulation system  
**Let us first consider information on paths - it tells people**  
where the path is, whether it leads to somewhere worthwhile, and  
whether or not they are allowed to take it.

ings. Tbe underground network In downtown Osaka, wblcb links  
two maJJI rallway stations. a number or smaller raJJways. and the  
subway statlono througll shopping concourses. defies any organi-  
zational principle. With over filly exit stairs, it is confusing for  
foreign visitor& and Japanese alike.  
Underground sclllngs arc difficult e.-en if the circulation sys-  
tem Is simple. We have data to show that even a layout essentially  
rectangular In form 11 dllncult to understand if it is underground.  
Tbe only distinction with an equivalent building above ground Is  
that the latter bu a building form that gives it an objectllke cha ..  
acter and that tells people something about what Is going on Inside.  
Building form can express tbe spatial organization or the

do It automatically. In the pairs or illustrations below, tbe square

treatment ol the entrance. Projected and rooesscd entrancee  
bclgbten leglblllty from an obllque approach. Marquees, portico•.  
and colonnades have a slmUar lmp8CI.

**11.5 Planning the architectural tniormation**  
**system\: a summary**  
esthetteally pleasing buildings and, at tbe same time, for excellent  
wayOndlng design.  
Proper articulation of the circulation system ooupled with the  
expression of destination zones will create distinctiveness, thereby  
giving landmark quality to these architectural elements.  
Finally, W1l reiterate the importance of redundancy in  
**wayfmding communication. The use of multiple means to communi-**  
cate the same information is tbe best guarantee that the message  
gets across. In oonsidering the needs of the perceptually impaired  
population, redundancy ougbt to be extended to include dllterent  
sensory modalities. Rather than relying exclusiVely on visual  
means of oommuolcatlng information, we should use auditory,  
tactile. and kl.netlc means as W1lll.

**ci.o.ification of graphic infonnation**  
12.3 Sign typee  
relevant lnlormatlon In the morning Is dlllerent from that which  
should be displayed In the al!ernoon. Monitors In &lrports, or large  
arrival and departure boards. are In a constant state of change  
througbout the entire day.  
Much is made in Chapter 15 of the need to provide wayflndere  
witb the rigbt \(i.e., the most up to date\) information at the rigbt  
time \(i.e., when Ibey need it\), and at the rigbt place \(i.e., where  
they need it\). In highly O uid settings sucb as airports, amusement  
parks, or sports arenas, for example, dynamic signs provide tbe  
obvious answer. In more stable situations, they may still be use!ul,  
but on a much more limited basis.

**Forms of graphic information**  
The purpose of "the graphics" In wayllndlng Is to assist people  
first In the decision-making process and then In the decision-  
executing process, In other words, to help them find their way  
to their destinations along their chosen routes.  
Before we come to the kinds ol graphics Involved In each  
process, In two subsequent cbapters, we deal here with the  
forms that graphic lnlormaUon may take.  
For purposes or slmpllclty, we subdivide these forms Into  
two major groups\: verbal \(or typograpblc\) and non-verbal \(or  
plctograpblc\). Each Is discussed In terms ol bow II ls allected  
by color, layout, and Ughtlng.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN  
Hul\)•" "" lm\~lly.theu..,olplalnl&ngu.,.oi,na'-'ly an easy-\~loUow route for vlslton to a given department or *offloe*  
in a large bulldlng complex Is no easy task. Part ol the solution la  
spatl&I planning that vlsllors can undentand and that actually  
helpe them. But there la •till the need !or signs.  
Ol-'lonal alps with arrow& at eadt and f!l-ery decision point  
la one poaalbW\~ \(aee p. 176\). "°"..,...,.· as any single omoe la  
unlikely to be tbe only destination In 80 large a building. there  
.. 'OUld be tbe need !or sips at ewery one or these decision points  
!or all or tbe other de.tlnallons as well.  
The reaull ls not only costly and unsig\)ltly, ii Is also non-asslml·  
!able. The average person, conlronted with this sort ol lnlormatlon  
overload. whether It be too many typographic messages. too many  
pictographs, or too many colon. ls hopelessly oontu&ed and stops  
trying to use the signs.  
By contrast, tbe number of signs needed can be enormously  
reduced ll signs are In pl&ln language and placed In strategic  
locatlons. or ll mln\~ln.lormatlon centers capable ol being Interro-  
gated are available to visitors. Such an Information centre, In  
answer to the que.tlon "How do 11!"1 lo sucb and such?" wUJ reply  
plainly, In the language or the visitor's choice, "Take the elevator at  
the end of the corridor to the 4th lloor, Room 432. •  
On the other band, we are far from being unaware that more  
\(not lesa\) language in signs la not going to help people with literacy  
or rea•Ung probtema. Obvlou&ly. then. Ibis •echnlque can be used  
only aelecllvely. The unhwsal adoption of a solution to the current  
amblgul\~ or atTOW1 would be a help. but the !act remains that  
cllrootlonal sips const.ttute the group that Is 111\<141 reaponslbte ror  
"sign pollution" and someqy must be round to reduce tbe number  
of signs requlred to get a visitor to a given destination. The verbal  
\(non-graphic\) approadl does this - but only, of COUl'SC, l! the visitor  
can read.  
It ls also worthy or note that it is not enough for the language to  
be plaln and clear, It must also be consistent\: the words uaed !or  
providing dlrectlonal lnlormatlon must be identical to those used In  
other Information types. There is no sense in directing vlsltors to a  
destination l! It Is going to be called one thing in the cllrootlona and  
another when they arrive there.

lnter·letter  
Good practice in signage, as in prin\~ is to vary the amount or  
spacing between letters to compensate lor their shapes and thus lo  
produce the illusion that the spacing is equal. \(In !act, 11 one did nol  
do this, and inserted identical amounis or space between all letters,  
lhe line would appear to be unequally spaced.\)  
The determination or bow much space to put between letters  
\(between two o's, ror example. as d.18tlnct lrom between two l's\)  
used to be done by eye, and craftsmen became very skilled at doing  
It just so. Manufacturers or individual letters \(or "Wes"\) ror sale  
would also Imprint on the masking tape a series or unlts or space.  
An accompanying table indicated how many unlis to place between  
individual letters depending on their juxtaposition, cap to lower  
case, lower case to lower case, lower case to digits, etc. All of this  
**is now done on tbe computer - and frequently not very well. Tbe**  
**principle is, however, the same.13**

**Whene\\'er a sign.face is not perceived by the vieYtoer straight-on.**  
angular distorlion occurs, reducing lhe legibility or the letters. A  
successful signage Jetterfonn wlll retain at least 75 percent or Its  
Iegiblllty when distorted 45 degrees. Under such conditions. a on&-  
lncb \(25 mm\) letter ls legible at 35 leet \(10.7 m\).

Two identically si1.ed images, side by side, one in positive \(black on  
white\) lorm, the other in reversed or negative \(white on black\) form  
wlll seem to be dillerent in size. The reversed image wlll appear to  
be up to 10 to 12 percent bigger, bolder, or latter than the other.  
Recent research at Georgia Institute of Technology's College or  
Architecture bas conrlrmed what designers have known from  
experience for some time\: that good "target value· ls one of a  
sign's most valuable characteristics.  
A light-colored sign on a wblte wall ls more dllllcult !or anyone  
to spot than ls a dark sign on the same wblte wall. This being so,  
the cllects or having light-colored letters and symbols on darker  
**fields must be taken into account. The phenomenon involved is**  
called haistion or irradiation because a light image located on a  
dark field wlll seem to radiate and as a result appears to be consid·  
erably larger.

°'""" • Google There are probably as many forms of arrows as there are  
lctter!orms. Some are better than others - "better" In the sense  
that they more e!!ectively communicate direction than do othera.  
Most, however, are just !ancilul.  
**When it comes down to making a statement about which is the**  
"beat" arrow, we just do not know. During the preparation o! work  
!or Expo 67, I \(Paul Arthur\) did some research with locus groups  
and came to the conclusion that an arrow In "1J.lcb the proportion  
of wings to shalt was 1\:2 was beat. Furthermore, the proportion of  
stem thickness to shalt, I was sure. had to be 1\:8.  
Nobody agreed with me and the Expo arrow was never seen  
again. Instead, designers favored !or a long time an arrow with a  
wing-to-shalt relationship o! I \: I, mainly because it lilted so neatly  
in a square and could, as the Expo arrow could not, be rotated  
easily through 360 degrees.  
**The processing of environment.al graphic communication can,**  
however, produce the most bizarre results on occasion. Many  
poople tended to perceive the "square" arrow \(under certaln cir-  
cumstances\) as a chicken footprint moving In the *opposite* d.lroo-  
tion to that which was Intended.  
The chamfering or the ends of the wings \(to reinforce d.lroo-  
tion\), the slight lengthening or the shalt \(to an approximate 7\:9  
rclatiooship\), and the groining o! the area where shaft meets wings  
\(whi ch had been a feature o! the Expo arrow\) all came later, and  
by the mid.SOS many o! us were reasonably sure that *this* was the  
**best arrow.**  
Designers, however, wllh their eyes so lirmJy fixed on form. are  
lrequently blind to content. The form o! the arrow Is one thing and  
whether there wlli ever be agreement on a "beat" form Is unlikely.  
It may not even matter very much. What does matter a great deal Is  
what designers do with t hese arrows.  
***AB* we have already observed earlier in this chapter, the arrow**  
**is a concept-related g1yph representing movement of some sort, but**  
**we frequently are not sure what kind of movement is indicated. I f**  
**the onl\)' movements v.-e ever needed to make v.·ere either to the left**  
or to the righ\~ there would be no problem at all. However, we often  
want to Indicate movement up and down - or straight ahead - and  
here many real wayflndlng problems arise. II the whole world were  
perfectly literate we would advocate dropping arrows altogl!ther  
**and just using words.**  
**Under such circumstances of universal literacy. the v.•ords**  
"straight ahead" would be much clearer than arrows that point  
indiscriminately up *and* down to mean the same things. \(Even

1 3.3 Color  
**Colors available for color coding\:**  
• **Red. yellow, and blue**  
• **Orange. green, and purple \(or violet\)**  
• **Brown and** \~ige  
# •Pink  
• **Black, white, and grey**  
**Turquoise is the sort of ambiguous hue th.at**  
**is not available for this purpose because for**  
**the many people who call it •blue,• there is**  
**an equal number who call it .. gre-en .. which,**  
**of course, defeats the whole purpose of**  
**color coding.**  
!or color coding purposes. The *only* colors avallable !or color  
coding purposes are thoso to which a gllnerally agreed-upon name  
can be put - like red or yellow or blue. While there may be a large  
number of tints and shades of these colors, Ibey would still be  
called red, yellow, blue, etc., and because there cannot be tv.'O or  
anything in a color code \(like dark blue and light blue, for exam-  
ple\), there are still only nine individual colors. There just aren't  
enough colors - and if there were, the memory load extends to no  
more than five at most, alter which people can neither remember  
nor distinguish between the colors used.  
Another problem Is the lmpraetlcality of color coding anything  
transient. II graphic design Is yellow, and fashion is blue, for exam·  
pie, whal happens when they move to another area? Uthe color  
**oode manifested itself in painted doors. tbc problem is insurmount-**  
able. Even if it is only the signs that are colored, the problems of  
stocking so many signs in dlllerent colors could be one sort of  
nightmare while switching the signs about could well be another.  
A way around this problem, however, ls to color code by areas,  
not by function. Thus a complex, iargll, square bullding might be  
subdivided Into quadrants, each of which had a color assigned to It  
permanently, lrre\$pective of which departments or functions  
occupied each. Graphic design could move from the yellow to the  
blue quadrant with no need to change anything. If one is going to  
apply a color code in Ibis way, then it should always be on a geo-  
**graphic, and never on a functional. basis.**  
But then there is still the matter of fading. Say five years later  
one has to match colors of new signs to those of the orlglnals. It Is  
most unllkely that this can be done. The old signs will have faded  
and, as a result, one will have tv.• o blues, two greens, and so on.  
A lar more practical approach ls to consider the colored lines  
which are brlefiy discussed In section 13.2.5. Tapes In lndMdual  
colors should be thought of as so many highways routed through  
the complex. One color might, for example, link together entrances,  
elevators, stairs, and perhaps washrooms. Small signs in verbal  
and non-verbal form along the route could indicate the direction of  
the closest stair, elevator, or washroom.  
Another color could lead to inter--00noected buildlngs whlle two  
others could pick up designated departments or lacllitles. As long  
as people always knew which lacllitles were on each of the colored  
routes, with small directional signs along the way to help,  
wayflndlng could be mucb slmplilied and the number of signs  
reduced.  
The question of where the lines should be placed is always  
raised. Everyone prefers the fioor - like Hansel and Gretel in the  
forest. But this is rarely a practical solution. The lines wear out or  
are obscured by objects placed afterwards In the corridors - or just  
by people. The celling ls better and, when It can be accompllshed,  
eye level on the wall Is best or all.

t3.3 Color  
A final point on the selection ol colors lor signs, one which  
**makes the task even more restrictive. i8 that there are certain**  
colors that should be reserved lor public safety uses only. These  
are red, yellow, and green.  
13.4 Layout  
There is a rule or thumb to the ellect that no signS should ever  
contain more than live or six messagl!6 or "bits" or information, or  
which the sign Itself ls one. There Is. however, some latitude In the  
meaning of "bits.·  
On a blgllway sign, bits are single lines. Thus a sign for motor-  
ists' use should contain no more than three lines ol copy. The kind  
or Information intended for pedestrian use, however. may be more  
extensi\\'tl. There would be little value, for example. to the averagoe  
building directory *U* it could only display three or lour lines or  
information. The information required at decision points, in the  
form or directional signs. will lrequently also run to much more  
than three or lour bit&.  
It Is Important to remember In tbls connection bow we "read"  
signs. We don't read signs the way we read print. There our habits  
are very structured\: we read consistently and sequentially left to  
rlgbt \(In Roman orthography\) and top to bottom. Signs, however, in  
an unlamillar environment, are read In the same way we read the  
rest ol the selling\: using a scanning and glancing process that is  
akin to a person looking for "meaning" In a non-objective work or  
art. \(See section 6.2.2 lor a description or this process or scanning  
and glancing.\)  
Thus we read signs In a relatively unstructured ""'Y· as a  
series of glances. \(This is at the root of wily people so frequently  
"read" signs for what they lhln.k they should say, rather than what  
they do say, as we saw In section 13.1.3.\)  
This glancing process requires that lolormatlon on dlrectional  
signs be somehow grouped into smaller units of, say, three lines  
each when large amounts or information need to be displayed.  
As the illustrations on the following page show, three columns  
of three messllfl"8 side by side are easier to assimilate than a  
single column of nine. Alternatively, If space requirements demand  
a vertical sign, the information Is equally acooptable as three  
groups, of three messages each, arranged vertically.  
Even better, when space permits in directional signs, is the  
separation or the groups into two signs - with those that lie on the  
viewer's left in one sign and those on his or her right in another.  
II is still, however, desirable that information be displayed in  
groupings ol no more than three or lour messages each.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN On the other hand, thla form o! llghtlng la not generally consid-  
ered adequate In larg1\>-scalc spaces ouch u concourses In alrpom  
or railway or bus statlona. Thero, olgns generally have their own  
artilicial illumlnaUon.  
In exterior settings, the same rules apply. II the apill from  
existing light scimes Is considered adequate, signs wlU not be  
provided with any other illumination. But I/ ambient light lo lnad·

There .,,, two cal"t!Ori•• or artlnclal lllumlnatlon !or signs\:

cent\: tbe graphlcs wlU be on either the !Int or the second aur!ace.  
In other ..-ords, they wlU be either In front o! or behind the slgn!ace.  
There are arguments In favor or both. although lrom anesthetic  
viewpoint. it la prelereable to ha\>-e the graphlc8 on tbe !Int sur!are  
and thus to reduce specular \(or \>'elllDg\) glare.  
In add.Iden. when plaatlc lacee .,,, fabricated from material

A point to keep In mind. however, Is that ptutlc rares aom&-

Light reOccted orr a signlace Into a viewer's eyca will cauao a. sign

**13.5 Wuminatioo of Sign!\>**  
**From a purely practical standpoint. s igns are**  
**the cause of many of the problems that**  
**beset people trying to find their way in**  
**unfamiliar settings. They affect able.bodied**  
**and disabled people alike - but consider the**  
**extent to which faulty signage exacHbates**  
**the problems of the disabled.**  
Digitized by Google  
It must be noted that some gloss on signs Is unavoidable. Even  
a surlaoo that appears flat or totally laeking in sheen when Wuml·  
nated and viOWlld at an angle near to the perpendicular will actu-  
ally appear somewhat glossy when the angle or view shifts to near  
the grazing angle ol 85 degrees off the perpendicular. In other  
words, angular distortion creates the appearance of gloss on  
coating\>; or materials that are inherently flat.  
Thus a satin finish will appear to be eggshell or even semi-gloss  
when viOWlld at a grazing angle, and semi-gloss finish will appear  
to be full-gloss under the same oonditions.  
On the other band, there Is the oompUcatlon ol vandalism.  
Glossy surlaoos. which decrease legibility, also discourage vandal·  
ism and are easy to clean; matte surlaoos, wblcb enhance legibility,  
may encourage vandalism and are difficult to clean. So it ls a  
**tra.deoff, but ooncem for vandalism is not a valid argument in favor**  
of shiny signfaecs.  
I . Ambiguity  
Although a message might be quite clear to the person who origi·  
nally put the sign up, it may be wholly unclear to the obscl'\\·er.  
2. Coalllct  
Bits of conflieting information in a sign \(or in two signs close  
together\) create dillicullies. This happens particularly when new  
signs are installed and the old ones are not removed. Or It may be  
the result or two signs that complemented eaeb other at one tlme,  
but that oonfilct in new circumstances.  
3. Deftclency  
**Too little information is just as bad as too much. A sign must**  
contain all the inlormalion that a person needs at that particular  
plaec.  
4\. Exce84  
Conluslon generally results when more data than a person needs ls  
provided at a given decision point.  
5. Glare  
**Signs are much more efficient when they are well illuminated.**  
**Sometimes a sign can be well illuminated from some standpoints**  
but obscured by reOected ligbt lrom others. Signs plaeed opposite  
windows, !or instance, can end up reOecting the outside. cars  
moving on the street, passersby, and so on.  
6. DleglbWty  
Messages that are illegible are those that are too small to be seen  
\(or recognized\) lrom the reading distance or the sign, even thougb  
there may be nothing wrong with the message. Readability and  
legibility are not the same.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 7.h\>accuracy  
II is essential to provide all the Information that people need, when  
they need it. But It must be the right information - up-to-date, and  
aoourate.  
8. Obstructions  
There is a constant jockeying for position in the environment and  
things end up obscuring or blocking the view of other things. Some  
things don't matler, but when a planter or Ugbt fixture or piece of  
HVAC equipm ent is placed in front of a sign, it does matter.  
9\. UnrellabWty  
Most people are prepared to depend on signs in an unlamtliar  
setting, but only for as long as they are dependable and do not, for  
no apparent reason, suddenly let them down.  
10\. Us  
Finally, we are not alwsys able to give our lull attention *to* the  
wayfmdlng taak. We are eaaily distracted. AB a reeult, we may mlss  
a crucial piece of information, a si8Jt, a landmark, an architectural  
feature we were told to turo J ell at, or whatever. A carelully  
planned wayltndlng system Is forgiving In the sense that we are not  
hopel essly and forever lost because we missed that laat cue, sign,  
or signal.

Experience demonstrates that the 60-\<legree oblique view Is  
prelerl'OO by most people because It Is regarded 88 more realll;tlc.  
However, such views introduce the problems of perspective and  
**cannot be used to measure distances \(or even to indicate them on**  
any sort or scale\).  
Whether this prelerence for maps which include photographic  
information \(even though modified\) is soundly based or merely  
subjective must be determined by others. However, it is safe to say  
that the more "realistic" a map of an exterior setting is, the more  
efficient It will be.  
And. or course. It must be remembered that orientation or  
alignment to the setting Is cruclal. This will help to compensate !or  
the map·s shortcomings which, 88 we have already noted, are Its  
verticality and its two dimensionality, Irrespective or what sort or  
**map it is.**  
Interior settings  
Rather different rules apply for interior settingl!. Axonomelric and  
perspective views are rarely as helpful 88 they are out.side. A higb-  
er degree ol stylization \(than is desirable in exterior maps\) is not  
only acceptable but Is likely to be helplul 88 well.  
At the same time. paradoxically, It must be noted that people  
have more dl!Dculty finding their way about In Interior spaces,  
where they are deprived of the kinds or cues they find so useful in  
the outdoors. In section 15.1, we present the reader with some  
concepts in floor and room numbering systems that are helplul to  
wayfmdcrs.  
Wayfmders often have a very difficult time when they are  
conl'ronted wllh too much information \(or, or course, too little\).  
Almost any map tends by its very nature to contain large amounts  
or Information. To digest or sort through thls can be a problem In  
ltseU and It Is only compounded when the visitor Is presented with  
several maps In one locatlon \(each of a dlllerent floor or level in  
the building\).  
When laced with such a "choice of maps," visitors may become  
confused and ignore the maps altogether. A far better practice is  
not lo try to do everything at once, but to take things a step at a  
lime\:  
• **Provide visitors with level numbers for all the tenants in the**  
complex, listed alphabetically.  
• Oel visitors to the correct level for the tenant they have come to  
see.  
• Provide, on each level, a map \(of that level\) to show where the  
tenants are actually located, with their addresses.  
• Ensure that this map Is properly aligned with the floor It.sell.  
Such a map can be very stylized and slmpillled. Wherever possi-  
ble, landmarks or building features should be Identified on the  
**map as a means of helping the. visitor.**  
Leglblllty  
Legibility in map design !or wayfinding bas tv.'O aspects. Firs\~ as  
an abstraction, the map should be.dei·eloned in a manner that

sbould be simple enough \(as we have observed above\) not to con·  
taln un11\<!c .. sary Information, but at the same time realistic  
enough to compensate ror the fact that it *is* an alJetractloo.

wayfioding map should never have a cap-height of less lhan  
.625 Inches \(10 to 15 mm\).  
Panoramic vlCWll arc not much used for wayfmding \(except al  
places like Niagara Falls or on the tops or tall buildings. where they  
are used lo ldontlly other buildings or goographical leaturea on lhe  
horizon\). This Is a pity, because they represent, in the right condJ.  
lions and setting, a very useful alternative to conventional maps.  
They also share rew or the limitations or maps\:  
• They are vertically poeltloocd.  
• They are reaaooahly realtatic in that Ibey display an ouUine  
drawing or the telling a person is looking aL  
• They are perfectly aligned to the selling it.sell.  
• They provide verbal \(typographic\) identiJicalioo for all major  
laod8caj\>e elements and building names.  
• *U* lhey are transparent, !be setting Is viewed through them and  
the \\ypographlc labels are auperlmposed on landscape elementa  
or buildings.  
• II thoy aro opaque, the S\<llling Is seen from an aerial viewpoint  
\(this Is a Joss orroctlvo, but generally moro practical, solution\).  
1bus ldentlllod, the buildings and the landscape elementa  
beoome tho mltors' own signs and there may be no rurtber need to  
identlly them or to provide dlreetlons to them en route.  
When building directories form part or a pa1ticular wayfindlng

**Graphic information for decision executing**  
Having successfully formulated their action plans \(see Chap-  
ter 14\), visitors to an unfamlllar setting wW need dlllerent  
types of Information to assist them In getting entclenUy to  
their cbo\<len destinations. Unfortunstely, however, few ol  
these "types ol lnformatlon" bave ever been standardized and,  
as a result, they are called dlllerent thing& In different bulld·  
lngs.  
**Floor level names are an example of this. ls the Door on**  
wblcb a person enters a bul1d1ng from the street called "main,•  
**or "'ground," or "'lobby," or .. 1," or somethlng else again? And**  
what If Ibis same building bas ma\)or entrances not \)ust on  
one level, but on two? *Are* each or these also called "ground"  
or "main," etc? And If not, then bow are they dlstlnguJsbed?  
How are Ibey Identified on elevator control buttons? Room  
numbering Is another area where, apparently, anything goes.  
Is there such a thing as a system? And If so, wW It work on  
open-landscape Doors as well as on tbo\<le with conventional  
corridors? Where do signs "go"? ls there a point to standardlz·  
Ing tbls, or Is It good enough to continue the practice of putting  
them wherever they can conveniently be Otted lo?  
These and other Issues dealt with lo this chapter are, we  
feel, very Important and, on all ol them, we bave reoommenda·  
!Ions to make. On the other band, there are many w\~s ol  
doing things, some neither better nor worse than others. It Is  
therefore less Important that our recommendations be adopted  
than !bat out ol them there should emerge an agreement  
among practitioners and bul1d1ng owners and managers Iba!  
standardization Is desirable.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 15.1 Floor and room numbering systems  
It Is rrequently a source or surprise to designers to learn just bow  
many people do not know \(without being told\) that room \(or office\)  
I 115 is on the I Ith Door. This is one orthose things designers and  
building man&glll'S take for granted without having any reason ror  
doing so.  
Another is the ideotilicalioo of Door levels themselves. North  
Americans have not so far developed a coordinated, universally  
accepted method or Identifying levels. from the parking or other  
levels below grade, through the ground or main Door \(which may or  
may not be at grade all around the building perimeter\). to the other  
Doors above.  
The general practice Is to start al grade and ealJ It something  
\(M or G or I or something else\) and then to work *dQWrl* through the  
Doors below and *up* through those above. This is all very well for  
buildings built on level ground but becomes a problem when the  
building is on the side of a slope or is connected to another building  
by an abov&ostreet pedestrian walkway.  
In such cases, there are two levels al which we can gain access,  
one higher than the other. Thus, in addition to what the owners  
\(and their architects\) think of as the "main" entrance, there Is  
another one al level 2 \(or even 8\).  
Now lmaglne going to a cUnlc on level 2 in a hospital built into  
the side of a steep slope. We enter on level 3 \(although we are not  
necessarily conscious or this on entering\). Which elevator button  
do we press? U p, of course, when we should be going down. More  
frustration. More stress.

Digitized by Google What can be done to help in such si tuations is to ensure that in  
every elevator lobby \(as part of the floor directory\) there is a  
prominent identilicalion of the Door level, as shown by the stars in  
the Ulustro.tlons.  
The use of a tactUe star is gaining currency and it does un-  
equivocally Identify the ground floor. What it does not do, however.  
Is Identify *arwt!wr* ground floor \(when there Is one, as in the  
example on the previous page\).

Our own recommendation is shown in the illustration\: beside  
the control button there is a tactile and high-contrast floor number  
or symbol and beside it an explanatory plaque identifying anoma-  
lies such as a second main exit. or other reatures such as informa-  
tion. The tactUe star must also be explained because no one Is  
going to call thls level the "Star Door." We lee! that It should be  
standardized as "Ground Ooor."  
Now, what about the level above "Ground"? Is It ·1· \(as in  
Europe\) or "2" \(as in North America\)? Prom a purely logical view-  
point. it should be 1 \(particularly if the level below it i s  
-1\). as the accompanying illustrations show.  
The level below "Ground" in so many commercial buildingo is a  
concourse or shops, restaurants, and other services; it should be  
ldentllled as "Concourse" and on the elevator control button as  
*·c\:* The meaning ol the word "concourse" may be weU enough  
established In our minds lor thls to be a workable solution, but It  
should still be explained on the control panel.  
Below the concourse level there are generally several levels or  
parking which are appropriately identified as Pt. P2, 1'3, and so on.  
in a downward direction. A different sort of problem arises in  
parking garages, however. when some of their levels are below  
grade and some above. Imagine sucb a garage where the third level  
Is at grade with two more levels above It and. say. three more  
below. How. under such circumstances. should one label the levels?  
Reentering the garage at P3 as a pedestrian to retrieve one's  
vehicle i s not helpful.

Remembering that we are accustomed to the idea of numbers  
dividing at grade and progressing upward toward the roof, and  
downward lO lbe bottom, we find "Pl," "P2," "P3." etc. !or the  
abov\~e levels and ·-Pl," "  
- P2," "-P3. • etc. for those below a  
useful concept, although It begs the question or what to label the  
level which Is *at* grade. Logically, It should be " •P" "I" or "O."  
Finally on this subject, the ldentllicatlon or the floor levels  
themselves, whether they are used for offices, retail outlets, or  
parking, should be very clearly identified, particularly al lbe tops  
of stairs and escalators and in ele\\•ator lobbies.  
We have just been discussing bow to identify the levels in a build-  
ing. Let us now focus on what the average visitor finds when  
emerging from an elevator on one ol lbese levels.  
Floors with eorTldors  
We have often speculated on why it is that a person arriving by bus  
at a small town comprising only a handful of streets will have little  
or no trouble rrnding his or her way while that same person, arriv-  
ing by elevator at, say, the third or fourth level of a hospital or  
university building, comprising the same number of corridors. may  
be at a total loss.

Thoughts on control panel nomenclature\:  
The star has gained wide currency as a  
tactile symbol for the Ground f loor. so why  
not u\~ It as a substitute for .. Main" or .. 1 ..  
or '"Ground" - particularty if it is explained  
in a panel close by, as shown in the illustra-  
tion on the opposite page.  
If the concept of levels below grade being  
identified as - 1, -2, and so on, is accepted,  
t here is still a need to explain the meaning  
of these symbols. Obviously "One below" is  
better than "'Minus one ... If one accepts the  
logic of the star as a kind of zero, then it  
follows that there should be a 1 above it and  
a -1 below it. even though North Amerkan  
custom is generally in favor of the level  
above Ground being identified as 2.  
Some researchers prefer SUB1, SUB2. etc .• for  
these below-grade floor levels. 1 A determi-  
nation should, however, be made as to  
which is the best solution and to stay w ith it.  
Note the explanation of the fact that there  
are two. not one, main entrances to one of  
these buildings\: one on the Ground floor  
and ano&f9iltil\\ Vr'J'nlhird level.

Di9itiR•by Google \(98 UNIVERSITYOFMICHIGAN Open-1And8C&pe Doors  
Not all Doors have corridors in the conventional sense. They may,  
for example, be made up of open space with dividers to create  
offices. While there are still corridors of a sort, they are not nearly  
as evident as they are when the walla go from Door to ceiling.  
The whole idea of open-landscape interiors ls to acknowledge  
and to facilitate change. This has led us to the conclusion that  
room numbering in such cases ls lmpoaslble. Instead, we have  
lound It uselul to create a series ol clearly Identified zones based  
on the spaces dellned by the columns. The complete or partial  
layout of a Door can change radlcally lrom time to time to accom-  
modate changing work habits or the growth of a department that  
NqUires relocation of personnel.  
By imposing an alpha-numeric grid over all the levels of the  
building in the normal way \(with letters on one axis and numbers  
on the other\), a consistent malrix is created. Thus the spaces \(or  
zones\) defined by the columns are identllled as Al , Bl, Cl \(or A2,  
B2, C2\) in one direction and Al, A2, A3 \(or Bl, 82\. 83\) In the other.  
This generally results In three to n"e persons sharing an "ad-  
dreas." *U* each ol them ls Identified by name at the entrance to  
their work space, a visitor coming to see one or them will experi·  
ence no dUllculty.  
As often as not, Doors in modern office buildings are a mixture  
of offices with regular partitions and work stations with dividers.  
This zone system works equally well here - even though ii ls ln8'1-  
table that some of the columns will be inside offices and, therefore,  
cannot be used to display the addreases.

**Designers and architects are making increasing use of landmarks**  
as part of integrated wayfmding aystems for a wide variety of new  
projects, from underground pedestrian walkways to airports,  
hospitals, and college buildingS. Generally speaking, landmarks  
perform two principal wayfmdlng !unctions\:  
• They help visitors to get their bearings. as the Eillel Tower does  
**in Paris, for example.**  
• They help staff lo provide directions to vtsilors, such as, "To get  
to my office, take the elevator to the third Door, go left, and  
continue on till you can see the drinking fountain. My office is  
Just opposite."  
These two examples help to demonstrate the tact that landmarks  
have very real and ellective uses, and that they can be virtually  
anything from a distinctive exterior structure to an interior drink·  
Ing fountain. Their wayfindlng usefulness is enhanced in interior  
spaces particularly when, as is so often the ease, the space is  
relatively bland or uniform. Many college buildings. for example,  
**consist of anonymous undifferentiated spaces connected by simi-**  
**larly anonymous corridors.**

15.2 Landmarks  
The placing or physical objects to act as landmarks within build·  
**ings creates an invaluable wayfmding toot The more bizarre and**  
startling the object, the more el!ective it will be, or course \(which is  
nol to discount the usefulness, as we have already observed, of  
mundane building features\). Althougb there may be inltlal reslst-  
anoe lrom stall at the Idea or dJ.recting visitors In a hospital to •go  
down the corridor lW you see the big red tomato, and It Is two  
doors further along on the le!t, • because they rear they will smile or  
giggle as they give such directions, is there anything basically  
wrong with that? Surely in a hospital or all places, anything that  
makes people smile \(or giggle\) cannot be all bad.  
**Because, in many of our cities. we are so used to thinking of**  
everything in terms o! the cardinal points o! the compass, our  
sense or dfsorienlation inside big buildings \(and particularly in  
those where we have no views to the oulside\) is total. We would  
not, however, be so d!sorienled if only someone or something would  
tell us which way Is north or south. For thls reason. the frequent  
display \(on noors or oelllngs\) or compass l'08e\$ is very helpful.  
**In new construction. we would go so far as**  
**to say categoricalty that it is essential that**  
**routes for the able bodied and for wheel·**  
**chair users be the same. We recognize,**  
**however, that in existing structures, this is**  
**not always feasible.**  
**.. Efficiency," for its own sake, cannot be**  
**considered the sole ulte\<lon In selecting a**  
**route for visitors to take. If the most effi·**  
**cient route to X·ray Is via Surgery, for ex.am·**  
**pie, it would be preferable to select a less**  
**efficient path.**

15.3 Location of signs  
In executing a decision plan, visitors are asked lo make many  
decisions *en* route to their destinations. The !ewer decisions they  
have to make, the more e!Dclent lbe route.  
**It is important that routes to destinations be the same ror the**  
able bodied and !or persons in wheelchairs.  
**Decision points manifest themselves mainly as corridor inter·**  
**sections and it is here that visitors must have assistance - fre-**  
quently in lbe form or signs.  
As the Wustrations show, we strongly recommend as good  
wayllndlng practice the use or lour signs per lntersecllon. Irrespec-  
tive of Its con!\(guratlon. This ensures maximum vlsibWty or this  
vital information !or visitors coming from all directions. The need  
to provide "the rigtit information at the rigtit place" \(which is what  
every wayfmding designer attempts to do\) is thus !ulftlled.  
**But what of the content? How much information can usefully be**  
provided in these signs? Most cities that permit exterior directional  
signs to important destinations at all, permit them only within a  
given radius o! lhe destination Ilse!!. Thus the hopeless effort or  
trying to provide. at every street corner, d!rectlons lo every desti-  
nation in the city Is a"olded. The same d!sclpllne must be applied  
to Interior signs. It is a hopeless and seU-de!eating task to attempt,  
**at 0\\'ery intersection, to provide directions to 0\\1 cry location in the**  
**building. \\Ve ha\\'e seen this actually done, and the effect is nothing**  
**less than chaotic.**  
What sort or information, then. should be included in signs at  
intersections? II the concept or destination zones \(see section 10.1\)  
has been incorporated into the planning or the buUding. the answer  
is obvious and the results will be efficient.

15.3 Location or sign•  
The main problem with directional signs is that if they are to be the  
least bit effective, they must be totally reliable, ln the sense that  
wayfmders must be able to follow a trail or series or signs, located  
at reassuring Intervals, to their chosen destination. This Is why It  
is so important that planners select with care what destinations  
they are gulng to provide directions to.  
Once any destination Is featured on a dlrectional sign at a  
given Intersection, there Is an obllgatlon to include it on every  
subsequent directional sign until the destination iB reached. This is  
further substantiation for the concept or providing long-distance  
directions !or gross areas or destination zones but strongly re-  
stricting the distances al which Individual destinations \(our "rai-  
sins" in a previous metaphor\) fll'St appear on directional signs.  
**15.4 Placement of** signs  
**We make a distinction between •tocating ..**  
**and •placing• signs. The former has the**  
**sense of location on plan. while the latter**  
**term refers to placement in elevation.**  
A 1.75 Inch \(45 mm\) cap-height message is  
displayed on. 3 inch *as* mm\) "blade" or  
**message module. F ive such blades total 15**  
inches \(380 mm\).  
We have long cherished a dream that at some time ln the future the  
entire world wtll acknowledge the need to ensbrlne graphic  
wayllndlng lnlormatioo ln a horizontal band. exactly 16 lnches \(400  
mm\) deep and positioned 47 inches\(1200 mm\) oil the ground \(or  
Door\). This iB VisuCom's lnfoBand I. It should be restricted exclu-  
sively to wayfmding Information and therefore should be free of  
thermostats, light switches, and other distractions \(although it is  
proper that lire alarms should be located wltbln It\).  
lnloBand 1 bas been restricted to the level betwoon 47 to 63  
inches above the noor \(120 *to* 160 cm\) !or two reasons\:  
t. This level fits more or less comfortably wltbln the oooe or vision  
of pedestrians, both adults and children, and or people In wheel-  
chairs. It is designed to acoommodate as many people as possi-  
ble. including those with low vision who must be able to get very  
close to a sign in order to read it. It also ensures reliability in  
terms of where users should expect to fmd a sign. the absence  
of whlch bas a devastating effect on wayllnders.  
2. This level may extend no more than 16 inches \(400 mm\) in  
height, allowing for no more than five lines of type. This Is In  
keeping with the wayfmding principle that no more than five  
lines or "bits" of information should be displayed on any one  
sign and with the recommendation that the cap-heigllt or the  
typeface used should be t.75 lncbes \(45 mm\). Under such re-  
strictions designers must be extremely selective in the wording  
or the messages.  
One can only speculate on what a different world it would be  
for wayfinders in unfamiliar settings if this principle of a band,  
sacred to the display of information, were to be established In  
every building, everywhere.

**sounds they cannot hear *or* make into visual signals on a screen** -  
or as hard copy on paper.  
A TDD keypad is used to type verbal messages \(in, say, a per-  
son ·s home\) which are transmitted via telephone lines to another  
TDD terminal \(in, say. an office somewhere\) providing that the  
other address. in addition to Its regular telephone number. also bas  
a TDD number. It can then re\<\:eive such a call.  
This equipment Is, of course, interactl\\•e in that it transmits  
dialog between the parties involved. It is relatively inexpensive and  
now there are portable versions weighing not mueh more than a  
couple of pounds.  
The role of TOils as W11yfinding devices to speech- and hearing -  
impaired persons is obvious. By enabling them to call abead and  
thereby obtain the kinds of information they need about a setting  
**or the services it offers, they are much more likely to make the**

15.5 Equipment  
Most of the time when we talk about wayfinding, we are dis-  
**cussing answers to well-defined questions such as, .. How do I. in**  
this particular location within Ibis overall setting, get to my desli·  
nation, namely the such-and-ouch?" But what *U* lhe location of lhe  
defltlnatlon ls *Ml* well defined? Or what *U* it ls not defined at all? In  
other words, what *U* a slgnlllcant part of the wayllnding equatlon Is  
missing?  
For example, what happens when a person arrives for the Orsi  
time at, say, a oommunlty oollege campus oomprlslng some four or  
five buildings to attend a oourse of lectures - but has no Idea  
whatsoever where the l ecture that evening will be held? Imagine,  
too, that several hundred courses are offered every day by this  
# insUtution.  
Assuming the person has been lucky enough to ascertain from  
someone who knows !hat lhe class ls in room 420 in ·A· Bullding at  
7 o'clock, we return to the relatively simple buslne88 of providing  
directions to Bulldlng A. then to lhe fourth Door, and finally to  
room 20 on that Door.  
But what *ll* tbe student bad not bad the good fortune to meet  
someone who knew where the class would be held? Trusting to  
luck is not good enough and this is where touch·screen Interactive  
equipment of some kind can provide all the information a person  
oould want in these or similar circumstances.  
The often used argument that only one person at a time can  
use such equlpmen\~ whereas many people can look at sign stmul·  
taneously, ls perfectly valid. However. the type of information we  
are discussing here could not be displayed on a sign for a wide  
variety of reasons. The room In which a class ls held may well vary  
from week to week. Several hundred different cJasees are *ottered*  
every day of the week and any sign displaying them all would be  
Impossibly huge and also Impossible to read.  
The alternative to the obvious Impossibility and Impracticality  
of blllboard·slz.ed signs is an information desk with a knowledgl\>-  
able attendant In charge. However, the same objection applies\: the  
attendant can deal with only one person at a time. Besides, the  
chance of there being more than one s1&11ed information deek ls  
extremely remote, whereas small ln!\<Hdosks of the type we are  
recommending can be strategically located tbrougbout lhe setting.  
What Schlossberg and others have made possible is the reallza·  
lion of a dream that one day accurate up-to-date Information oould  
be made available to people on a highly personal, t&ilor-made  
basis, specific to their particular needs at a parlicular time.  
Although the manufacturers of electronic directories are apt lo  
make extravftgllllt claims for what their products will do, there is  
no questlon that this equipment solves lhe agll-Old problem of  
containing vast amounts of ln!ormatlon while displaying only as  
much as a viewer can absorb at any given ttme.

through the directory, which provides names and room numbers  
of the building's tenants and sometimes other Information as well.  
Moreover, and even better, these directories display this infor-

Only one person at a ti.me can make use or such a directory, a  
serious limitation, but one that Is shared with all other types of

**person can talk to an attendant at an information desk.**  
The most interesting of these directories make use of fiat, not

100 mm\) or tbe average wall  
The most typical signal light Is the one that goes on \(usually red or  
green or white\) over the elevator door to signal the car's arrival  
and, In the case of green or red Ugbts, to Indicate to those walling  
the direction or Its travel\: green for up, red for down.  
Another valuable but rare use for signal lights Is to alert the  
deal that an alarm has rung. Visual fire alarms used to consist of a  
pulsing strobe light which was guaranteed to get everybody's  
attention. Recent research, however. has demonstrated that while  
a pulsing low-wattage light could be useful, strobes tend to be  
frightening and may cause temporary blindness in some people.

Different circumstances having to do with the particular func-

Digitized by **Google**  
With the advent of electronic directories \(see section 15.5.4\), the  
information desk and its attendant have in most types of bulldings  
gone the way of tellers in banks with the widespread introduction  
some years ago of automatic teller machines \(ATMs\).  
Visitors looking !or a human source or Information now nod, as  
we observed in the preceding section, security guards who may, or  
very well may not, be prepared to provide wayfinding information.  
In any case, because the prime responsibility of these person·  
nel is security, it is extremely unlikely that they will have been  
exposed to any sort of training in dealing with visitors' questions.  
much less in helping people with impaired speech, hearing, or  
sight.  
In wayfinding terms. this ls regrettable because, as we have so  
frequently stated throughout this book, wayflnding Information is  
not Umlted *to* architecture and signs. It ls also verbal and aural. We  
know that speech ls actually the preferred medium lor most per-  
fectly able-bodied people to receive certain types or information -  
particularly that type which used *to* be \\be main purpose lor having  
an information desk in the ftrst place, namely, to provide directions  
to destinations. If given the choice, most of us would much prefer to  
be *told* how to get there, rather than having to figure ii out from a  
directory, a sign. or even a map.  
For one thing, when you ask directions or people. you can get  
an idea of whether or not they know what they're talking about  
\(and therefore whether or not their inlormatlon Is reliable\). This  
you cannot do with signs and maps which, you may have learned  
**from experience. may or may not be. trustworthy sources o r infor-**  
**mation. A person can explain to you in detail \(and m ore than once,**  
**if necessary\) how to get to a give-a destination and can trace a**  
route on a map which you can take with you. These are things no  
static sign could ever be expected to do.  
All or these things are, admittedly. precisely what sophisticated  
interactive video systems are designed *to* do - right up to and  
including providing the '1sitor v.1th a printed map. The point is tha t  
this form of interael1on, whether with a Jive human being or with a  
machine, Is a desirable part or obtaining directional information.  
II information is to be imparted in the old-fashioned way,  
**person to person, it should be done in such a way as to take into**  
**account that visitors may have articulation, bearing, seeing, or**  
understanding problems. In other words, attendants should be  
trained to deal with these disabUitles in an understanding manner.  
They should. !or example, enunciate each word clearly. look vis\~  
tors squarely In the lace wblle talking, and never put their hands to  
their mouths \(or llddle with their moustaches\) while they are  
talking. They never know when they may be talking to someone

**should also not be situated near a Ruoresocnt light - one closer**  
than 15 feet \(4.5 m\) may interfere with reception. At least one  
**public telephone in ea.ch area should have a volume control in the**  
handS\<?I. The telephone company will convert public telephones in  
this way on request. The volume control also boosts the stre\~h of  
the magnetic field and therefore makes the telephone more acees-  
sible for users with hearing aids as well.  
Telephones provide an excellent means of conveying orientation  
and wayllndlng Information. The audible map Is an example. While  
Its origins Ue In attempts to provide a richer form of mapping  
lnformaUon for the blind than tactual maps can give. many persons  
**who are not blind prefer to obtain this sort or information in this**  
way, rather than in visual form. Typically. upon lifting the bandS\<?t  
**from its cradle, , visitors arc provided with a verbal description of**  
the building's chief characteristics, where they are within the  
**setting, where certain facilities are in relation to their position, and**  
so on.  
On a more exotic level, there are. actually, signs that talk upon  
command, activated by a hand-held Infrared control mechanism  
and received through either earphones or the band-held device  
ltaeU, acting as a speaker.  
Conventional public-address systems are usually of such poor  
quality and so badly lnstaUed as to be more of a nuisance than a  
help. It may also be argued that they have no place in environmen·  
**tal communications in public buildings.**  
However, a properly designed and instaUed PA system of  
**reasonable quality is an effective medium \(or informing visitors or**  
particular conditions \(such as emergencies\) and !or Imparting  
general information. as is successfully done In the airport In At-  
lanta. Georgia. There. as one proceeds from one major zone of the  
building to another. a voice identllles this fact and provides helpful  
Information which */\$* useful to everyone. but which is particularly  
valunble to the sight impaired.  
A good PA system should have a broad frequency range. equal-  
**ized to suit the environment and set at a medium volume with**  
sc\\'eral speakers \(rather than a high \\'Olume wllb few\). Its uS\<?ful-  
ness can be augmented by some sert of visual dlsplay. such as an

visual signs \(such as pulsing, but not strobe. or colored lights\) to  
provide visual reinforcement to the alarm.  
An imaginative and helpful use has been given to the bell in  
**el evator lobbies\: it is sounded twice to indicate that the arriving**  
elevator is going down and once to indicate up. Another method !or  
achieving the same result would be the use ol dillerentlated tones\:  
a higher one !or up, a lower one !or down. Bllnd persons otherwise  
have no way ol knowing, particularly ll they are alone, which way  
the elevator Is going to take them.  
It would be unfortunate II we V.'l!re to consider this and other  
such devices of value to sight-Impaired persons only. In Salt Lake  
City, In Stockholm, and In most Japanese cities, downtown inter·  
sections are equipped v.ith two dillerent birdlike sounds which  
**indicate. the direction in which it is safe Cor pedestrians to cross the**  
**road. A robinlike sound. Cor instance, indicates it is sate to cross**  
north-south, while a cuckoo, say, performs the same !unction east-  
# west.  
The original intention probably was to help bllnd or slgbt-  
lmpaired persons. But able-bodied visitors to the city report that  
the sounds act as a means or relnlorclng \(In an Insistent manner\)

helpful to everyone and probably results in more efficient traffic

to much Interpretation, given the !act that not all public buUdlngs

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 17.1 Maps  
Tac1ile maps are on!y one or the means or communicating  
wayflndlng Information to the bl!Dd and visually impaired users.  
\(Information contained In maps may al.so be provided in spoken  
form. 'lbeee are ...,ferred to BB audible maps and are potenti4lly  
useful for everyone, but am i"D"rally devised for people who have  
dlfllcultlet reading taclually. 'lbey are also uselul in si1uatlons

other oral communlcaUons environments. Audlble maps work best  
for single, simple routes. 'Ibey are sequential by nature, detMlrlblng  
bow to get from point A to point B.\)  
Tactile maps usually contain a detMlrlptlon In braUle or a route  
to be taken to "'ach a given destination. In other words, they  
provide the bralllo-readlng users with a decision plan.  
Like vlsulll maps. tactUc maps have two functions\: to glvo in-  
formation on how to reach a destination, and to provide general-  
ized lnformaUon about the spacial layout of the setting.  
TactUe maps are generally band held, although In some urban  
transit gystems. they are Cree-otancllng units l\<\>cated on station  
platforms. '!be problem that rree-.tanding units pose, ol course. It  
that before they can be used. they ha,·e to be found. and thlt &&-

the lnlormatlon they can contain II they are to be legjble In tacllle  
# terms.  
A tactUe map Is not simply a translation or visual into tactile  
phenomena. Visual and tacllle perception are quite diJlerent In  
character. '!be visual perception or a map is immedlate. providing  
the viewer with a global impression of spatial relationships. A  
spatial form \(Gestalt\), or a spatial syste m like a grid la understood  
at a glanC\(!. The tutlle perception of a map is sequential. The user

**These comments refer exclusively to hand·**  
held maps.  
the general form of a layout, while a small·scalc map may be  
**needed to provide users with detailed information of a route.**  
**Interlocking overlays can be used to increase information**  
content. A map may, for example, gi\\'e the spatial disposition of a  
layout, while the overlay gives a braille description of the facilities  
contained. Small tactUe maps have been designed in which the  
description ls Wlderneath the map in reversed braille. Although the  
map ts handy to use. reading brallle in nl\\•erse is not easy.  
The third option for increasing lnlormatlon on a tactile map is  
to differentiate between the heights of the raised symbols. ED\\1ron-  
mcntal features arc nlprcsented by three types of symbols. Single  
locations arc represented by points, links between places and  
barriers by lines, and spaces by surfaces. By using different  
heights for each type, as wcU as lhc braille legend, compnlhension  
**has been shown to increasc.1**  
The content and form of an international symbol vocabulary for  
tactUe maps is still being debated. While a standard set of symbols  
has been adopted by organizations such as the First European  
Symposium on Tactual Tov.'D Maps for the Blind \(Brussels, 1983\), it  
has been nljected by others who consider that more research is  
needed on the cartographic content, the symbol design, the quality  
of nlproduction, and the effect of standardization on map quality.'  
Various materials have been used to make tactUe maps.  
These range from sandpaper glued to surfaces, to vinyl, to paper.  
While vinyl maps tend to be more intelligible, paper maps tend to  
**produce less fatigue. Recent innovations in paper production**  
**such as capsule paper. hov.•ever, have made it possible to easily**  
produce Inexpensive maps of excellent quality.'  
**The practical realization of an audible \{or**  
**"talking" sign\) that is effective \(you touch it,**

**When it does, it will be an exciting develop·**  
**ment - not only for the blind where it will**  
**effectively do away with the need for tactile**  
**letters. but for the entire population as well.**

17.2 Signs  
At a time when the number of sightless people able to read braille  
comfortably Is shrinking, there is nonetheless an increase in the  
use of brallle ceUs in signs connected with elevators \(on ele-•ator  
door jambs and in the cars themselves\). At the same time, these  
braille cells arc generally accompanied by tactual \(or raised\)  
digits. There is good nlason to believe that many blind people have  
**difficulty interpreting the raised numbers also, but those who can**  
**use them outnumber those who can use braille.**  
None of this is an argument against displaying braille or tac-  
**tual signs. because if such signs "' ·ere more in midence in environ·**  
**mental communications, there could be no question that blind and**  
slgbt-lmpalnld persons would learn how to use them and would  
find them very helpful.  
Nonetheless It must be nlmembered that while braille ceUs can  
be interpnltcd by a ski!led nlader nlhlll,.ely speedily, the haptlc  
**exploration of Rom an lctterrorms that are raised 1 mm above the**  
**surface of a signfacc is a relatively slow process.**  
A study conducted som e years ago at Grorgia Institute of Tech·  
nology's C-OUege of Architecture for the Architectural and Trans·  
portatlon Barriers Compliance Board \(ATBCB\) in Washington, DC,  
**Original from**  
216 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN demonstrated tbat teaching blind people how to read tactile letters  
seems to be on the same level as the teaching of braille. Many of  
the volunteers had had no experience with tactile letters, while the  
remainder had been instructed in tbe reading of CAPITAL lellera  
only. II is, then, not surprising that they all had very real problems  
in interpreting loweNl880 letters.  
None of tbese. as we have said, are convincing arguments  
either for not providing tactual letters Jn signs for the use of tbe  
blind - or for re\>·ertlng to the Idea that all signs ror sighted as well  
as slght-lmpalred persons should neeessarUy be In upper case.  
**See section 13\. 1.3 for a counter·argument in**  
**favor of the use of caps in signs.**  
**There is no agreement on the desirability of**  
**tactile signs. which is a major reason why we**  
**see them so infrequentty - except. of course,**  
**in elevators where their presence is now**  
**standard. If there, however, why not f!Yery-**

**Pro and** con  
What should *or* should not be done to assist the sight impaired in  
getting about with greater facility?  
Tactile signs are very rarely installed anyv.ilere. Why is this? ls  
it because of ignorance? ls ii tbe dUficulty \(and added expense\)  
involved in their manufacture? Or ls it because blind people don't  
**want, or need, them?**  
Tactile signs are more expensive to manuracture tban en-  
graved *or* screen-printed signs \(and considerably more than com-  
puter-\<\:ut vinyl legends\). and yes. blind and low-vision people can  
and do use them when they are available \(although. as noted  
elsewhere. they find capital letters much easier to read than lower  
case letters\). Well, what about the other issues? Is there any objec-  
tion to their use? The Canadian National Institute for the Blind  
\(CNIB\) takes the rationalist view that anything that helps is good.  
and it is good because it is helpful. In the United States, on the  
other hand, opinion is sharply divided with one side \(represented  
by the American Foundation for the Blind and the National Councll  
of the Blind\) being of a view slmllar to that of the CNUl, whereas the  
other side \(represented by the National Federation or the Blind\) is  
violently opposed, malntalnlng that "enriching" environmental  
communication especially ror blind people \(the micro-approach\) is  
a clear signal that they cannot get about \(or earn a living\) without  
**these devices. And inasmuch as very fe-w environments are already**  
furnished with special signs and signals for the blind, employers  
**have an obvious '"excuse'" not to hire them.**  
This may well prove to be a dispute for which there ls no satis-  
factory solution but the evidence that blind persons perform well ln  
orientation and even directional situations \(see section 8.3.1\) is  
not, It seems to us, an argument against having tactual identifica-  
tion signs and direetlonal signs.

case letters\) mlg!lt be more appropriate also.  
Glyphs or pictographs are not appropriate subjects for lactlle  
signs - with the sole exception or the arrow in the case or tactile  
directional signs. The problems blind persons experience in inter-  
preting lower-case letters are magnified \~ral tllnes with picto-  
graphs.  
The Ideal tactile letters lor the slgllt llnpalred have a cap-helgllt  
olbe1"'00n I inch \(25 mm\) and t.75 Inches \(45 mm\). Largl!r tactile  
letters begin to cause problems in interpretation. Braille cells are  
standardized at just over a quarier or an inch high \(7 mm\). Sans  
serif letters are prelorable to serif letters in lactile signs.  
**Pictographs in interior situations are probably a minimum of 5**  
inches \(or 125 mm\) high; because they are so much larger and  
more complex than letterlorms, the blind find them difficult to  
interpret.

Tbe curb or the sidewalk Is an example or a shoreline followed by a  
blind person uslng a cane to negotiate streets.  
Leaving the relative security or such a shoreline ror the poten·  
tlal dangers or the open streets requires great determination - and  
the blind person experiences considerable relief when the farther  
**shore is eventually reached.**  
Buildings do not, as a general rule, have anything similar to  
such well-dellned paths as sidewalks. They do, hO\\Ve\\• er, !requenlly  
have large open spaces that may or may not be rilled with potential  
hazards for the sightless. although the sighted person can usually  
negotiate them without any problems.  
It Is desirable that architects, as they become more aware or  
the problems or the sightless, who are UteraUy adrift in these open  
spaces, wlll lntroduce into noor surfaces the necessary trails or  
**shorelines that will at least allow a blind person to cross the lobby**  
**from the. front door to the information desk, and to find the eleva-**  
**tors. However, this differentiation of Dooring materials and s· ur-**  
laccs must be an lntegral aspect of lhe architectural design from  
the very beginning, because it cannot easily be done on a catch-up  
basis afterwards, once the nooring is installed.

**Door** surface could be used to alert all visitors to the !act that a  
step or a stair or an escalator Is just ahead. Thls Is done ln the  
Eaton Centre, ln Toronto, with great style, and most or the sigllled  
visitors think It Is just an estbetlc device, a part or the floor pal·  
tern. II consists or a high degree or textural contrast between a  
black·pcbbled textured area and the smooth while quarry tile o!  
the Door that abuts ii. Tbis noticeable granular contrast is present  
**-wherever there is a flight of steps or an escalator.**  
Resiliency is the more easily detected than texture, from both an  
aural and a tactile standpoint. It used to be the practice to intro-  
duce differences or texture, in sidewalks, !or example, to alert the  
bllnd that they were coming to an intersection - even in some  
citles, such as Montreal, to attempt a guidance system !or the  
bllnd.  
It was, however, one of the llndlngs ol the Goorgla Tech re-  
seareh ln the early 80s that bllnd people were less sensitive to  
changes or texture than was originally thougllt and that most  
textures introduced into sidewalks or floors, intended to assist the  
blind, were either undetectable or indistinguishable from one  
another. Resiliency, on the other hand is higllty detectable and  
distinguishable \(provided one can hear\), and has the added advan·  
!age ol manifesting itself both aurally \(see section 16.3.3\) and  
tactilely. A rubberized area at the edge o! a subway platlorm, lor  
example, will not only *sound* dil!erent from the masonry Door, 11  
will also *feel* dillerent, and ol course. it should *look* dillerent as

We know a little bit more than this about e.rchite\<\:ture and  
wayfinding. Already in antiquity, wayfinding design was practised  
for some settings\: labyrinthine spatial layouts were specifically  
designed to disorient people. The purpose was tv.'O!old\: to protect  
**some treasured or sacred objects Crom thieves, or to protect a**  
**place or m•en a city rrom invaders.**  
The power of the labyrinth was physical - to disorient people  
and get them lost. It was also psychological - to Induce a feeling of  
danger and fear.  
Today we are rediscovering wayflnding and wayfindlng design,  
not to bury sacred crocodiles as the old Egyptians did in the laby-  
rinthine pathways within their pyramids, nor to confuse invaders  
**of our cities as was done. in some urban centers of antiquity, but to**  
**assist the wayfinding person in the built environment. an environ·**  
**ment that bas become more complex and often more confusing**  
than anything the Grrek historian Herodotus wrote about in his  
**descriptions of the ancient world.**  
Assisting people in Ibis context means making the built envi-  
ronment accessible. wayfinding ef!lclent, and sale for all - Lnclud·  
ing people with temporary and permanent disabllllles.  
Throughout this book, we have made It clear that wayflnding  
design Is not the antllhesis of interesting design. Quite the reverse.  
**It provides the designer and planner with excelJent reasons to**  
**develop interesting spatial organizations. to articulate settings.**  
**and to communicate interest to the user.**  
**Because wayfinding design comprises basic issues such as**  
**accessibility and safety, it covers large areas or concern, some or**  
which pose difficult questions involving socie\~ choices.  
Wayfinding design is based on wayflndlng behavior. This  
implies that designers need to know the basics about en,1roomen·  
\~ perception and cognition\: they need to know about de\<\:islon  
maldng and spatial problem soMng.  
In addition, it is ne\<\:essary to understand and to know about  
**v.rayfinding behavior in specific situations such as emergencies, in**  
**specific settings such as underground facilities, and for particular**  
groups such as the visually impaired.  
Wayfinding design is also a skill - some might call it an art. II  
involves landscape design, urban design, e.rchilectural, Interior,  
industrial, and graphic design.

**Original from**  
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN Wayflndlng design Is now recognized as a major Issue and one  
may weU ponder the best policy !or Its practice. It ls quite clear  
that architects. urban designers, landscape designers, and environ-  
mental graphic designers should know the rudiments or wayflndlng  
design. This can only be assured If It Is Incorporated Into educa-  
tional curricula. Professional t raining, In the long term, Is our best  
guarantee. This book has been partly conceived with this use in  
# mind.  
**It must be remembered that architects have many issues to**  
consider when planning a project. Although they ought to know  
about wayflndlng design, they may not themselves be a ble to do it  
**justice in the development of complex settings. They use structural**  
and mechanical engineers. Why should they not use wayfindlng  
specialists as weU ?  
Tbe time has come to start thinking along those lines.

Anatomy of a public building complex  
Just as wayllndlng inlormatloo can be broken down Into Its compc\>-  
nent parts \(see Chapter 12\), It is useful to think or building com-  
plexes as comprising a number of components as well. This makes  
everything more manageable.  
We have round it useful to divide the average building complex  
into fJVe zones \(or component parts\) and lhree circulation systems.  
as follows\:  
The Ove zones\:  
• parkJng lots or gar8gl!1l  
• entrance\(s\) to the building  
• main lobby  
•communal lacllltles  
•departments, omces. tenants  
The three clrculatlon systems\:  
• vertieal circulation  
•horizontal circulation  
•egress throughout the building
