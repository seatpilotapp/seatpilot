# Lessons from Top Tech  
# Companies  
**M**y first book, INSPIRED, discussed how strong product teams  
at the best product companies use the modern techniques of  
productdiscoverytosolvehardproblemsinwaystheircustomerslove,  
yet work for their business.  
INSPIRED brought me and my SVPG Partners into many more  
organizations, well beyond Silicon Valley.  
The most striking thing we learned was that in so many  
companies—even companies trying to do true, technology-powered  
products and services—product teams were too often not allowed to  
work the way they needed to.  
We realized that it’s not just the techniques that strong prod-  
uct teams use to discover successful products, but that the differences  
between how great product companies work and the rest run much  
deeper.  
**1** **2** EMPOWERED  
What we found in these companies was not pretty.  
The Role of Technology  
So many companies still have the old IT mindset when it comes to  
technology.It’sviewedasanecessarycostratherthanthecorebusiness  
enabler it needs to be. The people who work on the technology teams  
areliterallythere“toservethebusiness,”andthetechnologymanagers  
andleadersaretheretofacilitateservingthebusiness.Orit’sshovedoff  
to the side in some “digital” business unit. The technology teams are  
disconnected from the real customers—in fact, they’re encouraged to  
think of their stakeholders as their customers.  
Coaching  
There is little if any active coaching of the people on the technology  
teams.Andeveniftheywantedtocoach,themanagersoftendon’thave  
the experience themselves. So the problems perpetuate.  
Staffing  
Most of these companies recognize that they don’t have the staff they  
need,buttheyhaveverymisguidedideasabouthowtocorrectthat,and  
what to look for in product staff. So again, the problems perpetuate.  
Product Vision  
These companies rarely have an inspiring, compelling product vision.  
They may have had one during the early years of their company, but  
afterthefoundersleft,thevisionfaded.Thepeopleonthetechnology  
teams feel like they’re just working in feature factories. Lessons from Top Tech Companies **3**  
Team Topology  
The technology people are divided up into teams where they feel like  
they aren’t responsible for anything meaningful, they can’t do much  
without depending on changes from several other teams, and that  
they’re just a small cog in a giant wheel.  
Product Strategy  
It wouldn’t be fair to say that most of these companies have a weak  
productstrategy,becauseintruth,mosthaveliterallyno strategyatall.  
Theyarejusttryingtopleaseasmanystakeholdersastheycanwiththe  
people and time and skills they have.  
Team Objectives  
Most of these companies have heard that Google and others use the  
OKR \(Objectives and Key Results\) technique to manage their work,  
and the CEO watched a video or read a book and thought it sounded  
easy.Sotheyadoptedthetechnique—layeringitontopoftheirexisting  
product roadmaps and culture—and every quarter there’s a planning  
exercise that consumes a few weeks and is then largely ignored for the  
rest of the quarter. Most of the people on the teams say they get little  
if any value out of this technique.  
Relationship to Business  
The relationship between the technology teams and the rest of the  
business is not good. The stakeholders and executives have little or no  
trustinthetechnologyteams.Andthepeopleonthetechnologyteams  
feel like unappreciated mercenaries, subservient to the business.  
Empowered Teams  
Worst of all, the teams are not empowered to solve problems in ways  
customerslove,yetworkforthebusiness.Andassuch,theteamscan’t  
be held accountable to results. **4** EMPOWERED  
Theproductmanagerisreallyaproject manager,shepherdingthe  
backlog items through the process. The designers and engineers are  
there just to design and code the features on the roadmap.  
Motivationis low, senseof ownershipis minimal, and innovation  
is rare.  
It is easy to see why so many of these companies are ripe for dis-  
ruption.Andnothingatalllikehowproductisdoneatstrongproduct  
companies.1  
What is especially shocking to me is that it is really no secret  
how the best companies work, and how financially successful they are.  
Which raises the question, why is this the case?  
Inmyexperience,it’snotthatthesecompaniesdon’twant totrans-  
form, it’s that transforming is hard, and they just don’t know how. Or  
even what it really means to transform.  
What they need is to move to empowered product teams.  
Now,youmaynotbeusingthatterm,andyoumaynotevenreal-  
ize there are different types of technology teams.  
But if what I described is similar to your organization, I need to  
share with you a few very hard truths\:  
• First, you have very little chance of getting meaningful business  
results, let alone actually innovating, from your way of working  
• Second,yourcustomersarebig,ripetargetsforacompetitorthat  
does not operate this way \(e.g., Amazon\), and knows how to pro-  
vide products customers love, yet work for their business  
• Third, you are largely wasting the talents and capabilities of the  
people you have hired, and your best people—the ones you des-  
perately need to survive and thrive—will likely leave  
• Finally, if you think that by moving to Agile you’ve already done  
some form of digital transformation, I am sorry to tell you, but  
you haven’t even gotten started  
I’mhopingthatthereasonyou’rereadingthisbookisbecauseyou  
are convinced there must be a better way.  
And there is.

# Behind Every Great  
# Company  
**I**n this book, I want to share and highlight the differences between  
how the best companies create technology-powered products and  
how mostcompanies create products.  
The differences are both fundamental and striking.  
The differences certainly include what many people think of as  
“product culture,” but strong product companies often have very dif-  
ferent cultures from one another, so it clearly goes beyond that.  
For example, consider Amazon, Google, Apple, and Netflix. I  
would argue all four are very strong product companies, having con-  
sistently innovated for many years, yet they each have very different  
cultures.  
I still believe culture is extremely important, but there is some-  
thing about great product companies that is more fundamental.  
It comes down to the views they have on the role of technology,  
the purpose of the people who work on the technology, and how they  
expect these people to work together to solve problems.  
**5** **6** EMPOWERED  
Moreover,Idon’tthinkit’sanaccidentthat,despitetheirdifferent  
cultures, these four companies have the most important elements in  
common.  
What I will try to do in this book is untangle the parts of the  
culturesofthesecompaniesthataremoreareflectionoftheirfounders’  
personalities from those that are essential to consistent innovation.  
IwanttosharetheimportantlessonsI’velearnedregardingwhat  
separates the best from the rest.  
One surprising common thread among many of the best product  
companies is the legendary coach, Bill Campbell. During their forma-  
tive years, Bill literally provided executive coaching to the founders of  
Apple, Amazon, and Google, as well as several others.  
TogetasenseofBill’sviewsandvalues,hereisoneofmyfavorite  
quotes about the role of leadership in a strong product company\:  
Leadership is about recognizing that there’s a greatness in everyone,  
and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can  
emerge.  
This book is all about identifying what makes such an environ-  
ment, and I want to encourage you to consider adopting these impor-  
tant practices and behaviors.  
PleasenotethatIamnotarguingthatthesestrongproductcom-  
paniesaremodelsofvirtue.Allofthemhavebeenjustifiablycriticized  
about some of their policies and practices.1  
But when it comes to the ability to consistently innovate, all four  
of these companies have demonstrated their skills, and I believe there  
is much to be learned from them.  
At the core, I see three critically important differences between  
the strongest product companies and the rest\:  
The first is how the company views the role of technology.  
The second is the role their product leaders play.  
The third is how the company views the purpose of the product  
teams—the product managers, product designers, and engineers.  
Let’s take a closer look at each of these.  
1For an unflinching critique of these companies when it comes to their policies, see the  
writings of Professor Scott Galloway \(www.profgalloway.com\). Behind Every Great Company **7**  
# The Role of Technology  
There is a fundamental difference between how strong companies  
view the role and purpose of technology as compared to most other  
companies.  
At its most basic level, the vast majority of companies view tech-  
nologyasanecessaryexpense.Theyknowit’simportant,buttheythink  
of it more as a cost of doing business. If they can outsource the labor,  
evenbetter.Fundamentally,theydon’treallyconsiderthemselvesinthe  
technology business. Instead, they think of themselves as in the insur-  
ance business, or the banking business, or the transportation business,  
or whatever. Certainly, they need some technology to operate, but it’s  
viewed as a subservient role to “the business.”  
Becauseofthat,inmostcompanies,technologyteamsexisttoserve  
thebusiness. That is very often the exact phrase you will hear. But even  
if they aren’t explicit about it, the different parts of “the business” end  
up driving what is actually built by the product teams.  
In contrast, in strong product companies, technology is not an  
expense,itisthebusiness.Technologyenablesandpowerstheproducts  
andservicesweprovidetoourcustomers.Technologyallowsustosolve  
problems for our customers in ways that are just now possible.  
Whether the product or service is an insurance policy, a bank  
account,oranovernightparceldelivery,thatproductnowhasenabling  
technology at its core.  
As such, in strongproduct companies, the purpose of the product  
team is to serve customers by creating products customers love, yet work for  
thebusiness.  
That is a profound difference, which impacts nearly everything  
aboutthecompanyandhowitworks,andresultsinmuchhighermotiv-  
ationandmorale.Andmostimportant,itresultsinamuchhigherlevel  
of innovation and value for customers and the business.  
# Strong Product Leadership  
Inmostproductcompanies,theroleoftrueproductleadershipislargely  
missing in action. **8** EMPOWERED  
Instead, they are mainly there as facilitators, responsible for  
staffing the in-house \(or even worse, outsourced\) feature factory, and  
keeping the trains running on time.  
In most companies, there is no product strategy. Notice I didn’t  
say a bad product strategy—I mean literally no product strategy. The  
feature teams are simply there “to serve the business.”  
The business certainly has reasons for what they request or put  
on the roadmaps, but they very rarely have a product strategy, or even  
the skills or data required to create one.  
The stakeholders end up providing product teams with a priori-  
tizedlistoffeaturesandprojectsthattheyneedcompletedthisquarter  
or this year. So, the “product strategy,” if you could even call it that, is  
really about trying to please as much of the business as possible.  
When technology product companies moved to Agile methods  
over the past 10–20 years, many managers and leaders questioned  
whether they were still necessary, since team members would be  
expected to take a much more active role in how they work.  
I realize this is counterintuitive to many people, but while mov-  
ing to truly empowered teams does require moving away from the old  
command-and-control model of management, it does not mean you  
needfewerleadersandmanagers.Itmeansyouneedbetterleadersand  
managers.  
It’s actually easier for a manager to manage \(often micromanage\)  
in the old command-and-control style. It’s not hard to assign a team a  
list of activities, or a list of features to build, and just tell them to do  
the work as fast as they can.  
Whilethiscommand-and-controlstylemaybeeasierfortheman-  
ager, it creates teams of mercenaries with no empowerment in any  
meaningful sense.  
In contrast, in strongproduct companies, the product leaders are  
among the most impactful leaders in the company.  
Theyareresponsibleforstaffingandcoachingtheproductteams;  
they are responsible for the product strategy and converting the strat-  
egy into action; and they’re responsible for managing to results.  
Empowered product teams depend on skilled product managers,  
product designers, and engineers, and it is the leaders and man-  
agers who are responsible for recruiting, hiring, and coaching these  
people. Behind Every Great Company **9**  
Further, a focused and compelling product strategy—based on  
quantitative and qualitative insights—is among the most important  
contributions of product leadership.  
# Empowered Product Teams  
In most companies, the technology teams are not empowered product  
teams, they are what I call here featureteams.  
Feature teams look superficially like a product team. They are  
cross-functional,withaproductmanager,aproductdesigner,andsome  
number of engineers. The difference is that they are all about imple-  
mentingfeaturesandprojects\(output\),andassucharenotempowered  
or held accountable to results.  
The feature teams get to work first designing the features on the  
roadmap,maybedoingalittleusabilitytesting,andthenproceedingto  
building, QA testing, and deploying the features \(known as delivery\).  
These feature teams sometimes claim they’re doing some prod-  
uct discovery, but they rarely are. They’ve already been told what the  
solutionshouldbe;they’renotempoweredtogofigureoutthesolution  
themselves. They’re just there to design and then code.  
In these feature teams, there is usually a person with the prod-  
uctmanagertitle,buttheyaremainlydoingprojectmanagement.They  
are there to ensure the features get designed and delivered. Necessary  
perhaps, but this is not productmanagement.  
Because the teams are provided, or are pressed to provide,  
roadmaps of features and projects, the focus of the team is delivery—  
delivery of these features. And features are output. Even if someone  
were to complain of lack of business results, who would you hold  
accountable?

So, to summarize feature teams vs. empowered product teams\:  
Feature teams are cross-functional \(a product manager doing  
mainlyprojectmanagement,aproductdesigner,plussomeengineers\),  
and assigned features and projects to build rather than problems to  
solve, and as such they are all about output and not business results.  
Empowered product teams are also cross-functional \(a product  
manager,aproductdesigner,andengineers\),butincontrasttofeature  
teams, they are assigned problemsto solve, and are then empowered to  
come up with solutions that work—measured by outcome—and held  
accountable to results.3  
# Product Discovery  
If you have not yet read INSPIRED, then you might be wondering\:  
Whatissowrongwiththebusinessownersandstakeholdersdecidingwhat  
goesontheroadmap, and therefore what the engineers should build?  
This is considered the first and most important principle of  
product discovery\: ourcustomers,andourstakeholders,aren’tabletotell  
uswhattobuild.  
It’s not because our customers or stakeholders aren’t smart or  
knowledgeable.  
2Tobeclear,thedesignerandtechleadcontributemuchmorethansimplyensuringusabil-  
ity and feasibility respectively; what I’m referring to here is who we hold responsible and  
accountable for each risk.  
3Thereisactuallyathirdtypeoftechnologyteam,whichisreferredtoasadeliveryteam\(or  
“Scrum team” or “dev team”\). A delivery team doesn’t even pretend to be a true product  
team.Theyarenotcross-functional,andtheyarenotempowered.Thereisaproductowner  
\(responsible for administering the product backlog\) and some number of engineers. They  
are purely about output \(code and ship\). If you’re running a process like SAFe, then this  
is unfortunately you, and truthfully, I have no idea why you would want to read this book,  
since what I describe here is the polar opposite both philosophically and practically. Behind Every Great Company **11**  
There are two fundamental reasons why our customers and  
stakeholders aren’t able to tell us what to build\:  
First, the customers and stakeholders don’t know what is just  
now possible—they are not experts in the enabling technologies, so  
they can’t be expected to know the best way to solve the problems  
we’refocusedon,oreveniftheproblemispossibletosolve.It’soften  
the case that innovations solve problems in ways that customers and  
stakeholders had no idea was possible.  
Second, with technology products, it’s very hard to predict  
in advance what solutions will work. There are many reasons why  
product ideas don’t deliver the results we hoped. All too often we are  
excited about some idea, but our customers are not, so they don’t  
buy what we thought they would. Or, we discover the idea has major  
privacy or security issues. Or we find out the idea will take much  
longer to build than anyone expected.  
Empowered product teams understand these inherent issues,  
and product discovery is about discoveringasolutionthatourcustomers  
love,yetworksforourbusiness.  
We refer to this as product discovery to acknowledge that we  
understandwhatwecan’tknowinadvance,andtoemphasizethatour  
task is to discovera solution that is valuable,usable,feasible,and viable. **CHAPTER**

**I**promisethatthisbookisverypractical,andyou’llbeabletodirectly  
apply everything we discuss. But in this one chapter, if you’ll bear  
with me, we need to get just a little philosophical.  
Itisplaintoseethedifferencebetweenfeatureteamsandempow-  
ered product teams.  
It is plain to see when companies view teams as there to serve  
thebusiness,versuswhenthey’retheretoservecustomersinwaysthat

It is plain to see when a company is just trying to please as many  
stakeholders as possible, versus when they have a clear and intentional  
product strategy.  
But while these differences might be plain to see, that does not  
explain why these differences exist.  
Ifwehopetoclosethegapbetweenthebestandtherest,weneed  
to look at the root cause of this gap.  
**12** The Role of Technology **13**  
Roughly a decade ago, Marc Andreessen published what I con-  
sider one of the most important essays of our time, “Why Software  
Is Eating the World.”1 He described why he believed that technology  
wasabouttocausemajordisruptionacrossvirtuallyeveryindustry.He  
gave voice to what I had been seeing in my own work—primarily with  
the disruptors, but occasionally with those under threat of disruption.  
Ten years later, it’s clear he was remarkably prescient.  
Thatsaid,most companiesseemtohavenotreallyunderstoodhis  
warnings.  
Yes, they’re all spending more on software now.  
Yes, they’ve \(mostly\) moved to Agile methods.  
But most have not transformed in any meaningful sense, and in  
particular most have not embraced technology as the business enabler  
it is.  
The examples of this are unfortunately everywhere.  
Oneoftheclearestandmostegregiousrecentexampleshastobe  
theabsoluteineptitudeoftheleadershipatBoeingwiththesoftwareat  
the heart of the aircraft manufacturer’s shocking 737 MAX crisis.2  
Boeing’s fundamental mistake was to consider this technology as  
just a necessary cost, rather than the core competency that enables  
them to provide the safest, most fuel-efficient, and most cost-effective  
airplanes available.  
Rather than staffing an empowered product team—continuously  
workingtoprovidethesafest,mostfuel-efficient,mission-criticalcon-  
trolsoftware—theydecidedtooutsourcethistechnology,thinkingthey  
could maybe save a few dollars.  
It’s not just the aerospace industry. The automotive industry has  
suffered from this mindset for decades,3 until Tesla came along and  
proved what is truly possible when technology is at the core of the  
car, rather than treated as just a necessary cost. Going far beyond nav-  
igation and entertainment systems, using technology at its core and  
over-the-air updates, a Tesla actually improves over time rather than  
simply depreciating. Consider that for a moment.

Pixarhasshownthefilmindustrywhatistrulypossiblewhentech-  
nology is at the core of an animated feature film, rather than just a  
necessary cost. Pixar uses technology in ways far beyond traditional  
film-making, and the technology teams are as valued as the creative  
teams.  
As you may know, Pixar is now part of Disney, and look at how  
Disney has embraced technology to completely reimagine so many of  
their existing businesses. This includes everything from their legacy  
theme parks to what they’ve recently done with the Disney+ video  
streaming service.  
The same story is playing out in the insurance, banking, health  
care, telecommunications, education, agriculture, transportation, and  
defense industries. I could keep going.  
Often, when I am having dinner with one of the CEOs from a  
company that doesn’t get this, they’ll tell me how they’re not a tech-  
nologycompany—they’reaninsurancecompany,orahealthcarecom-  
pany,oranagriculturalcompany.I’llsay,“LetmetellyouwhatIwould  
do if I was a product leader at Amazon or Apple, and we’ve decided to  
goafteryourmarketbecausewebelieveitislargeandunderserved,and  
that technology is available that enables dramatically better solutions  
for your customers.”  
After describing how we would set up our teams around the  
enabling technology to optimize for true innovation, I also point out  
that, competitively, we would be betting on them not being able to  
respond because they would be too busy trying to protect their old  
business.  
It’s not that these CEOs don’t admire what companies like Ama-  
zonandNetflixandothershavedone—theygenerallydo.It’sthatthey  
don’tseehowtheselessonsapplytothem.Theydon’tunderstandwhat  
Marc was trying to warn them about.  
Of course, there are many possible reasons why the CEOs of  
these companies have been so slow to grok this. Sometimes, they have  
workedintheoldworldofbusinesssolongthattheyneedmoretimeto  
wrap their head around the changes. Sometimes, I can’t help but feel  
like they are fearful of technology. Sometimes, they just seem to be  
resisting change. But, ultimately, these are all just excuses. The board

seenmorewastedtechnologyinvestmentthanIfindinthesecompanies  
that don’t understand the true role of technology.  
Rather than outsourcinghundreds or even thousands of mercen-  
ary engineers—and providing them roadmaps of features from their  
stakeholders which rarely generate the necessary business results—I  
explaintothemthattheywillreceiveamuchgreaterreturnfromasig-  
nificantly smaller number of the right employees. Employees who are  
given business and customer problems to solve and are held account-  
able to the results.  
One way or another, becoming one of the best companies today  
requires senior leaders who understand the true and essential role of  
technology.  
# The Technology Leader  
One very common manifestation of how a company views the role  
of technology is whether the engineers building the company’s prod-  
ucts report up to a CIO \(chief information officer\)/head of IT, or  
whether they report up to a CTO \(chief technology officer\)/head of  
engineering.  
This may seem like a minor issue, but I’ve come to realize it’s a  
muchmoresignificantimpedimenttotransformationthanmostcom-  
panies realize.  
With the big caveat that each individual CIO is a unique per-  
son, I share this not as an absolute, but as something to seriously and  
honestly consider. Also, it is important to realize that the core CIO  
job \(managing the IT function\) is both important and difficult.  
Buthere’stheproblem\:theCIOtrulyis thereto serve the business.  
The very traits that make for a strong CIO can easily end up  
undermining the company’s attempts to transform.  
That’s my theory for why I’ve found it very difficult to  
get CIOs—even strong CIOs—to appreciate, much less adopt,  
the mindset, methods, and practices of product engineering  
organizations.  
\(continued\) **16** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
What’s especially problematic is that product engineers—the  
type the future of your company depends on—are rarely willing  
to work for a CIO because they know this difference in mindset is  
extremely important.

In some cases, I’ve encouraged the CIO to retitle as CTO  
\(because I believed the person was up to the challenges of this much  
larger role\), and in other cases I’ve strongly encouraged the CEO to  
hire a true CTO to lead product engineering. **CHAPTER**

# Leadership  
**T**he heart of this book is the importance of strong product  
leadership.  
Tobeclear,by“productleadership”Imeantheleadersandman-  
agers of product management, the leaders and managers of product  
design,1 and the leaders and managers of engineering.  
For this discussion, I will distinguish between leaders and man-  
agers. Certainly, many leaders are also managers, and many managers  
arealsoleaders,butevenifbothrolesarecoveredbythesameperson,  
there are different responsibilities.  
Overall,welooktoleadershipforinspirationandwelooktoman-

1In this book I refer to the role of product design, and the title product designer. Many  
companies use the terms user experience design or customer experience design. What’s  
important is that I am including service design, interaction design, visual design, and, for  
devices, industrial design.

# The Role of Leadership—Inspiration  
The subject of strong leadership, is of course, a major topic, but it is a  
clearandvisibledifferencebetweenstrongproductcompaniesandmost  
companies.  
The purpose of strong leadership is to inspire and motivate the  
organization.  
If product teams are to be empowered to make good decisions,  
they need to have the strategic context necessary to make those  
decisions.  
Part of the strategic context comes from the senior leaders of the  
company,suchasthepurposeofthebusiness\(themission\)andcritical  
business objectives, but the product leadership has four major explicit  
responsibilities\:  
# Product Vision and Principles  
The product vision describes the future we are trying to create and,  
most important, how it improves the lives of our customers.  
Itisusuallybetween3and10yearsout.Theproductvisionserves  
as the shared goal for the product organization.  
Theremaybeanynumberofcross-functional,empoweredprod-  
uct teams—ranging from a few in a startup, to hundreds in a large  
enterprise—but they all need to head in the same direction and con-  
tribute in their own way to solving the larger problem.  
Some companies refer to the product vision as their “North  
Star”—in the sense that no matter what product team you’re on, and  
whatever specific problem you’re trying to solve, you can all see and  
followtheNorthStar.Youalwaysknowhowyourpiececontributesto  
the more meaningful whole.  
More generally, the product vision is what keeps us inspired and  
excitedtocometoworkeachday—monthaftermonth,yearafteryear.  
It is worth noting that the product vision is typically the single  
most powerful recruiting tool for strong product people.  
Productprinciplescomplementtheproductvisionbyspeakingto

produce.Theprinciplesreflectthevaluesoftheorganization,andalso Strong Product Leadership **19**  
some strategic decisions that help the teams make the right decisions  
when faced with difficult trade-offs.  
# Team Topology  
The“teamtopology”referstohowwebreakuptheworkamongdiffer-  
entproductteamstobestenablethemtodogreatwork.Thisincludes  
thestructureandscopeofteams,andtheirrelationshiptooneanother.  
# Product Strategy  
Theproductstrategydescribeshowweplantoaccomplishtheproduct  
vision, while meeting the needs of the business as we go. The strategy  
derives from focus, then leverages insights, converts these insights into  
action, and finally managesthe work through to completion.  
# Product Evangelism  
Another critical role of leaders is communicating the product vision,  
principles, and product strategy—both to the internal product organ-  
ization, and also across the company more broadly.  
John Doerr, the famous venture capitalist, likes to explain that  
“We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.”  
Ifwewantteamsofmissionaries,it’sessentialthateverypersonin  
the organization understands and is convinced—they need to be true  
believers.  
This requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting,  
onboarding, weekly 1\:1 coaching, all-hands meetings, team lunches,  
and everything in between.  
The larger the organization, the more essential it is to be very  
goodatevangelism,andit’simportantfortheleaderstounderstandthat  
evangelismissomethingthatisnever“done.”Itneedstobeaconstant.  
Wewanttoensurethateverymemberoftheproductorganization  
has joined because they sincerely believe in the larger purpose.  
Normally, it is the product vision that describes what people are  
signing up for, but one way or another, we need to ensure the people  
on the team are true believers. **20** EMPOWERED

cate for internal combustion engines.  
# The Role of Management—Execution  
Thereareofcoursemanytypesof“managers”inacompany.I’mmost  
interested here in those people responsible for hiring and developing  
the actual members of the cross-functional product teams.  
Normally, this includes the director of product management, the  
directorofproductdesign,andthemanagersanddirectorsofengineer-  
ing. I’m not focused here on more senior-level managers \(managers  
of managers\), or non-people managers \(such as product managers or  
product marketing managers\).  
If you want to have truly empowered product teams, then your success  
dependsverydirectlyonthesefirst-levelpeoplemanagers.  
If you are wondering why there are so many weak product com-  
panies in the world, this would be the primary culprit. And until and  
unless this is corrected, there’s little hope for transformation.  
It is important that these managers understand—and can effec-  
tivelycommunicate—theproductvision,principles,andproductstrat-  
egy from the senior leaders. Beyond that, these managers have three  
critically important responsibilities\:  
# Staffing  
These are the people we hold responsible for staffing the product  
teams. This means sourcing, recruiting, interviewing, onboarding,  
evaluating, promoting, and when necessary, replacing the members of  
the teams.  
IfyouhaveanHRfunctionatyourcompany,theyaretheretosup-  
portmanagers with these activities, but they are in no way a substitute  
for the manager in these responsibilities. Strong Product Leadership **21**  
# Coaching  
Probably the single most important, yet most often overlooked, elem-  
ent to capable management is coaching. At the very minimum, this  
involvesaweekly1\:1withthepeoplewhoreporttoyouastheirpeople  
manager.  
Itisthemostimportantresponsibilityofeverypeoplemanagerto  
develop the skills of their people. This most definitely does not mean  
micromanaging them. It does mean understanding their weaknesses  
and helping them to improve, providing guidance on lessons learned,  
removing obstacles, and what is loosely referred to as “connecting  
the dots.”  
Forexample,let’ssayyouarethemanagerofproductdesign,and  
you meet each week for an hour or so with each of the six product  
designers from six different product teams that work for you.  
These six product designers are each first-class members of their  
cross-functional product teams \(because design is a first-class activ-  
ity, and as such it needs to partner closely with the product manager  
andengineersastheytackleandsolvehardproblems\).Butevenifthat  
designerisexceptionallyskilled,howcanshebeexpectedtokeeptrack  
ofwhatisgoingonwithalltheotherproductteams?Whatifthedesign  
she is working on right now for her situation is in some way inconsis-  
tent or incompatible with solutions underway with other teams? The  
design manager is expected to flag these conflicts and get the relevant  
designerstogethertoconsiderthebiggerpictureandtheimpactofthe  
different solutions on the user.  
Moregenerally,everymemberofaproductteamdeservestohave  
someone who is committed to helping them get better at their craft.  
This is why, in the vast majority of strong tech product organizations,  
theengineersreporttoexperiencedengineeringmanagers;thedesign-  
ers report to experienced design managers; and the product managers  
report to proven managers of product management.  
# Team Objectives  
The third responsibility of the people managers is to ensure that each  
product team has one or two clear objectives they have been assigned **22** EMPOWERED  
\(typicallyquarterly\)whichspellouttheproblemstheyarebeingasked  
to solve.  
These objectives derive directly from the product strategy—it’s  
where insights are turned into actions.  
This is also where empowerment becomes real and not just a  
buzzword. The team is given a small number of significant problems  
to solve \(the team objectives\).  
The team considers the problems and proposes clear measures  
of success \(the key results\), which they then discuss with their man-  
agers. The managers may need to iterate with their teams and others  
totryandgetasmuchcoverageaspossibleofthebroaderorganization’s  
objectives.  
The litmus test for empowerment is that the team is able to  
decidethebestwaytosolvetheproblemstheyhavebeenassigned\(the  
objectives\).  
It takes strong managers to be self-confident and secure enough  
totrulyempowerthepeoplethatworkforthem,andtostandbackand  
let the team take credit for their successes. **CHAPTER**  
# 4  
# Empowered Product  
# Teams  
**W**hat is most surprising to me is that the virtues of truly empow-  
ered product teams are not a secret. In fact, there are plenty of  
booksandarticlesouttherethatdescribewhythesetypesofteamsare  
so much more effective at innovation and in solving hard problems.  
While quite a few these books are inspiring and well worth read-  
ing,mostcompanieshavenotbeenconvincedtoempowertheirteams  
in any meaningful sense. Why is that?  
When I ask this question of CEOs and other key leaders of these  
organizations, the answer typically boils down to one word\: trust.  
The leaders don’t trust the teams. Specifically, they don’t believe  
theyhavethelevelofpeopleontheirteamstheyneedtotrulyempower  
them. So, along with the other key business leaders from across the  
company, they believe they need to very explicitly direct the teams  
themselves. This is also known as the “command-and-control” model  
of management.  
**23** **24** EMPOWERED  
When I ask these leaders why they don’t put people in place that  
theydotrust,theyusuallyarguethattheyeithercan’tfind,can’tafford,

Netflix hire.  
IthenpointouttothemthemanypeopleIknowwhohavemoved  
fromcompaniesliketheirstooneoftheseleadingcompanies,andhow  
their performance dramatically improved in the process.  
And further, having worked with many people at each of these  
companies, I point out how ordinary the vast majority of the people  
on these teams actually are. Maybe the important difference lies else-  
where?  
Maybe these strong companies have different views on how to  
leverage their talent in order to help their ordinary people reach their  
true potential and create, together, extraordinary products. **CHAPTER**

being a good coach.  
—Bill Campbell  
**B**ill made this statement years ago, but one of the major learnings  
of our industry post-pandemic, is that coaching is more essential  
than ever. If you hope to innovate at scale, it is simply not optional.  
Problems escalate faster, relationships are damaged much more easily,  
and collaboration is harder.  
Which is why you’ll notice that the longest part of this book is on  
coaching. That is no accident.  
In the technology industry, we focus so much on the core skills and  
competencies used by product managers, designers, and engineers, but  
so little on the skills and competencies of managers and leaders. Yet it  
is these managers and leaders who are responsible for molding people  
into effective teams.  
The logic is simple\: Your company depends on successful prod-  
ucts. And successful products come from strong product teams.  
**31** **32** EMPOWERED  
Coaching is what turns ordinary people into extraordinary product  
teams.  
If a product team is not effective, we need to look hard at the  
people on that team and see where we can help them improve as indi-  
viduals, and especially as a team.  
The chapters in this part highlight the most important areas of  
coaching and development for members of product teams. Unless  
you’ve been personally coached by an experienced manager, many  
of the topics may be new to you. Certainly, if you can speak from  
experience on these topics, so much the better, but if not, it is still  
valuable to be able to discuss the topic openly. You can learn and  
improve together.  
More than anything, good coaching is an ongoing dialog, with the  
goal of helping the employee to reach her potential. **CHAPTER**

# The Coaching  
# Mindset  
Coaching might be even more essential than mentoring to our careers  
and our teams. Whereas mentors dole out words of wisdom, coaches roll  
up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. They don’t just believe in our  
potential; they get in the arena to help us realize our potential. They hold  
up a mirror so we can see our blind spots and they hold us accountable  
for working through our sore spots. They take responsibility for making  
us better without taking credit for our accomplishments.  
—Bill Campbell  
**I**n this chapter, I’d like to focus not on the people you are trying to  
coach, but rather, on the necessary mindset of you as coach.

actually undermine their intent.  
**33** **34** EMPOWERED  
For example, you may be committed to having regular  
one-on-one meetings with each of your team members, but if these  
meetings consist primarily of you allocating and prioritizing tasks,  
they are not helpful—and likely even harmful—as a coaching tool.

Ifyouareanexperiencedcoachormanager,youmayhavealready  
developedyourownsetofprinciples.Ifnot,orifyouarenewtoman-  
agement, or if you are responsible for developing a new manager, this  
chapter attempts to describe the most important guidelines for coach-  
ing and management.  
# Developing People Is Job \#1  
It’samazinganddistressinghowfewmanagersactuallysubscribetothis  
principle—that developing people is job \#1. Most say the right things  
abouttheimportanceoftheteam,buttheiractionstellaverydifferent  
story.Theyseetheiraccountabilityforaggregateproductoutcomesas  
their most important job and treat their teams as a means to an end.  
If you are a manager, you should be spending most of your time  
and energy on coaching your team. This means expending real effort  
on things such as assessing your team, creating coaching plans, and  
actively helping them improve and develop.  
You should measure your own job performance on the successes  
of your team members, even more than the success of your products.  
# Empowering People Produces the Best Results  
Many new managers see their job as driving their team’s task list.  
This may result in a few short-term tactical successes, but your  
product will never reach its full potential if the team is only asked to  
execute your ideas and actions. More important, you will find it very The Coaching Mindset **35**  
hardtoretainstrongpeoplewhentheyhavesolittlesenseofownership  
over their work.  
Empowering means creating an environment where your peo-  
ple can own outcomes and not just tasks. This doesn’t mean less  
management—it means better management.  
You must step back to create this space, while stepping in to  
remove impediments, clarify context, and provide guidance.  
Remember that we need teams of missionaries, not teams of  
mercenaries.  
# Beware Your Own Insecurities  
Insecure managers have a particularly hard time empowering people.  
The insecure manager is so worried about being recognized for  
their contribution, they can see their team’s success as a threat to that  
recognition, rather than the confirmation of the contribution that it  
truly is. They may deal with this by closely controlling how the team  
works, or by controlling the team’s visibility to leadership. Truly bad  
managers may actively undermine their own team.  
Be aware of your insecurities and understand how your behavior  
can interfere with empowering your team.  
I want to be clear that this is not about being arrogant. If  
anything, arrogance itself is frequently a manifestation of insecurity.  
Most good managers have a healthy level of humility and are always  
exploringandworkingtoimprovetheirownperformanceandgrowth.  
They can have these feelings without micromanaging or undermining  
their team.  
Youmightbewonderingwhatyoucandoifyou,asaleaderinthe  
organization, don’t personally have the necessary experience to coach  
and develop others. If this is the case, at least you are aware of this  
major gap in your qualifications for the job, but it will be essential for  
you to immediately find some product leader coaching for yourself.  
Find someone that has been there and done that at a strong product  
company and engage them to coach you—and help you in coaching  
your people. **36** EMPOWERED  
# Cultivate Diverse Points of View  
Aninsecuremanagermaysuppressopinionsthataredifferentfromher  
own. This obviously impedes the development of the team, but it also  
stifles her effectiveness as a leader. Good leaders know that they will  
get the best results when they are able to consider diverse points of  
view. They also know that they don’t have a monopoly on good ideas  
and that the best ones may come from others.  
Nurturing a team that allows for diverse points of view begins  
withthehiringprocesswhereyouconsideryourteamasaportfolioof  
strengths and backgrounds.  
Itcontinueswithcreatingaspacewherealternativepointsofview  
can flourish. In some cases, this means empowering a product person  
toapproachherworkinawaythatisdifferentfromyours.Inothers,it  
means collecting a diverse range of opinions so that you can make the  
best decision.  
NotethatI’mnotsuggestingyouencourageconsensusofopinion  
withinyourteam.Rather,asamanager,youarehelpingyourteamlearn  
how to make good decisions collaboratively—leveraging the skills and  
expertise of each person.  
# Seek Out Teaching Moments  
Many, if not most, people are not aware of their own potential. As a  
coach, you are in a unique position to help them see it.  
Reaching potential requires working through adversity. As  
a coach, you are always looking for opportunities that encourage  
your people to stretch beyond their comfort zone. Use judgment to  
right-size the opportunity for the person and development area. You  
shouldn’t ask someone to try something that you know they aren’t  
ready for, but you need to find things that create some discomfort. It’s  
through pushing through the discomfort that people overcome their  
fears and realize what they’re truly capable of.  
Reaching potential doesn’t just mean addressing gaps in compe-  
tence. It also means recognizing and developing inherent strengths.  
This is particularly important for more seasoned product people who  
already have a good grasp of the job. The Coaching Mindset **37**  
# Continually Earn the Trust of Your Team  
None of your coaching efforts will be effective without trust.  
Thisisnotsomethingyoucandemandorexpecttohappenonits  
own. It comes from continually demonstrating through your actions  
your genuine commitment to the success and development of each  
member of your team.  
Of course, it’s important that you support your team both pri-  
vately and publicly. Even more important is being honest with them  
in both praise and criticism. Don’t hold back if someone is doing par-  
ticularly well. Similarly, don’t sugarcoat areas that need improvement.  
Always remember to praise publicly but criticize privately.  
Ihavefoundthatyoucanhelpestablishpersonalrapportandtrust  
by sharing some of your own personal challenges. Trust also comes  
from expressing a genuine interest in the person as a person, and not  
just a member of the team.  
Ofcourse,youmustusejudgmenthereandnotpryorinsertyour-  
self where you’re not wanted. That said, I’ve always found that trust  
grows whenever a working relationship is humanized.  
# Have the Courage to Correct Mistakes  
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can’t find a path for a team  
member to become successful. When you reach this point, it’s impor-  
tant that you act decisively.  
Formanymanagers,thisisthehardestprincipletofollow.Coach-  
ing is about development, so you are necessarily looking at people’s  
problems as opportunities to develop. More than this, telling some-  
one they are not working out is one of the most painful conversations  
you can have. It can feel easier to just avoid it altogether and soldier  
through.  
This hurts you, your team, and the person herself. First, you are  
likely spending much more time on this person than you should, at  
the expense of others. You’re also signaling to the rest of the team  
thatyou’rewillingtotoleratemediocritywhileatthesametimeasking  
them to work hard—a reliable path to undermining trust and killing **38** EMPOWERED  
motivation. Finally, the person with the performance issue is not get-  
tingtheopportunitytomovetoanothersituationwhereshemayhave  
a better shot at success.  
Note that I’m not suggesting you be cavalier about firing  
people or moving people into different jobs. You should always treat  
these decisions very seriously. I am saying that when you know, don’t  
wait. You’re not doing anyone any favors.  
I \(Chris\) was fortunate in my early career to work for a company  
thatwasdeeplycommittedtothevaluesofcoaching.Theleadersdidn’t  
just“talkthetalk”aboutteamdevelopment,theytookrealactionevery  
daythatcommunicatedtheircommitmenttotheseideals,bakingthem  
firmlyintothecultureofthecompany.Thismeantthat,asIgrewinto  
progressivelylargermanagementandleadershipresponsibilities,Ihad  
a solid framing for approaching my job, and I did my part to pass the  
ideas along—both in words and actions.  
Unfortunately, most companies today are not so committed to  
coachinganddevelopmentoftheirpeople,andyoumayhavetobethe  
one who models this approach. This starts with having a clear under-  
standing of, and commitment to, a strong coaching mindset.  
# Alternatives to Manager as Coach  
Inthemajorityoftechcompanies,theorganizationalstructureisvery  
typical.It’safunctionalorganizationalmodel,whichmeansthatprod-  
uctmanagersworkforamanagerordirectorofproductmanagement;  
thedesignersworkforamanagerordirectorofdesign;andtheengin-  
eers work for a manager or director of engineering.  
In this organizational model, the manager is expected to serve  
as the coach of her reports.  
However, there are a few alternative organizational structures  
out there, and in these alternative structures the manager might not  
havethenecessaryexperienceintheroletobeabletoprovideeffective  
coaching.  
An example of this might be that we have a person in a product  
team leadership role—similar to the general manager of a small  
business unit—and that person might come from any number of The Coaching Mindset **39**  
backgrounds. Let’s say for the purposes of this discussion that she  
comes from business development.  
Nowlet’ssaythemembersofthecross-functionalproductteam  
all report to her. But she has never been a product manager, or a  
designer, or an engineer. How can she coach her reports?  
While it is our first choice to have the manager be the coach,  
when this is not possible, we can stillprovide effectivecoaching. The  
key is that someone in the organization needs to be tasked with pro-  
viding the necessary coaching.  
So, for example, there may be a design manager from another  
partoftheorganizationthatisaskedtoprovidethenecessarycoaching  
to the designer. Similar for the product manager, and for the engin-  
eers.  
The key is to ensure that, one way or another, coaching is con-  
sideredatoppriority,andthateverypersononaproductteamknows  
who is specifically assigned to help her develop and reach her full  
potential. **CHAPTER**

# The Assessment  
**I**n this chapter, I will describe a coaching tool for helping managers  
of product people raise the level of performance of the people that  
report to them.  
I want every product leader to feel considerable urgency and  
importance around this need.  
Empoweredproductteamsdependoncompetentproductpeople,  
andifyoudon’tdevelopyourpeopleandprovidegrowthopportunities,  
there are usually other companies that will. I have always been a big  
believer in the old adage that “people join a company but leave their  
manager.”  
This chapter explores the technique that I use and advocate for  
assessing a product manager. It is easily adjusted for product designers  
or tech leads.  
It is the foundation for then coaching the person to success \(the  
coaching plan, which we’ll discuss next\).  
**40** The Assessment **41**  
This assessment is structured in the form of a gap analysis. The  
purpose is to assess the product person’s current level of competence  
alongeachofseveralnecessarydimensions,andthencomparethatwith  
the level of competence that’s expected for this particular role.  
Thisformatacknowledgesthatnotallskillsareequallyimportant,  
not all gaps are equally significant, and expectations change with the  
levelofresponsibility.Thistoolisintendedtohelpfocustheattention  
where it is most needed.  
# People, Process, and Product  
AsreadersofINSPIRED know,thetaxonomyIliketousewhentalking  
about product is the three pillars\: people, process, and product.  
For purposes of the assessment tool, I like to cover product first  
because product knowledge is the foundation for everything else.  
Without competence in product knowledge, the rest doesn’t really  
matter.  
Product Knowledge  
• User and customer knowledge—Is the product manager an  
acknowledged expert on her target users/customers?  
• Dataknowledge—Istheproductmanagerskilledwiththevarious  
datatoolsandconsideredbyherproductteamandherstakehold-

• Industryanddomainknowledge—Istheproductmanagerknowl-

competitive landscape and the relevant industry trends?  
• Business and company knowledge—Does the product manager  
understand the various dimensions of your company’s business,  
including marketing, sales, finance \(both revenue and costs\), ser-  
vices,legal,compliance,privacy,andsoon?Anddothestakehold-

typicallyrequirestwotothreemonthstorampuptospeedonproduct  
knowledge,assumingshedivesinaggressivelyandspendsseveralhours  
per day learning.  
Process Skills and Techniques  
• Product discovery techniques—Does the product manager have  
a strong understanding of the product risks and how to address  
each of them? Does she understand how to tackle risks up front,  
before engineers are asked to build? Does she know how to  
solve problems collaboratively? Does she focus on outcome?  
Doessheunderstandandutilizebothqualitativeandquantitative  
techniques?  
• Product optimization techniques—Once a product or new cap-  
ability is live and in production, does the product manager know  
how to utilize optimization techniques to rapidly improve and  
refine her product?  
• Product delivery techniques—While the product manager’s pri-  
mary responsibility is discovery, she still has an important sup-  
porting role to play in delivery. Does she understand her respon-  
sibilities to the engineers and to product marketing?  
• Productdevelopmentprocess—Doestheproductmanagerhavea  
solidunderstandingofthebroaderproduct-developmentprocess  
includingdiscoveryanddelivery,aswellastheproductmanager’s  
administrative responsibilities as the team’s product owner?  
New product managers are expected to know the basic tech-  
niques, but strong product managers are always developing their skills  
and learning new and more-advanced techniques. Much like a good  
surgeon is constantly following the latest learnings on surgical skills The Assessment **43**  
and techniques, a strong product manager always has more to learn in  
terms of skills and techniques.  
People Skills and Responsibilities  
• Team collaboration skills—How effectively does the product  
manager work with her engineers and product designer? Is it  
a collaborative relationship? Is there mutual respect? Is the  
product manager involving the engineers and designer early  
enough and providing them direct access to customers? Is the  
product manager fully leveraging her team’s skills and minds?  
• Stakeholder collaboration skills—How good is the product man-  
ager at collaborating with her stakeholders across the company?  
Do they feel like they have a true partner in product that is gen-  
uinely committed to their business success? Has she established  
mutual respect and mutual trust with each stakeholder, including  
the senior leadership of the company?  
• Evangelism skills—Is the product manager able to effectively  
share the product’s vision and product strategy, and motivate and  
inspire her product team as well as the various stakeholders and  
others in the company who must contribute to the product in  
one way or another?  
• Leadership skills—While the product manager does not actually  
manage anyone, she does need to influence and inspire people,  
so leadershipskills are important. Is she an effectivecommunica-  
tor and motivator? Do her team and stakeholders look to her for  
leadership, especially in stressful situations?  
Peopleskillsaresimilartoproductknowledgeinthatifyoudon’t  
have a solid foundation, it is very hard to do the PM job at all. Yet,  
as with process skills, strong product managers constantly work to  
improve and develop their people skills.  
Note that the taxonomy above is the set of skills and techniques  
thatIgenerallyuse.However,incertainsituations,Icustomizethislist  
based on the company’s culture or the company’s industry.  
As an example, in media companies there is a special and critic-  
ally important relationship between product and editorial, and I like **44** EMPOWERED  
to call out this relationship explicitly and not leave it bundled in with  
other stakeholders. Which is to say, if you as the product leader think  
youshouldadjustthistaxonomyofskills,thenbyallmeansyoushould  
do that.  
# The Gap Analysis  
Now that we have the skills taxonomy, the core of this technique is a  
gapanalysis.Thewaythisworksisthatthemanagershouldreviewthe  
set of criteria above and assign two ratings to each skill.  
# Expectations vs. Current Capability  
The first rating is an assessment of where the employee needs to be in  
thisskill\(i.e.,expectations rating\),andthesecondratingisanassessment  
of where the employee currently performs on this scale \(i.e., her capa-  
bility\).Itypicallyratetheseona1–10scale,with10beingaskillthatis  
absolutely essential to the job.  
So,forexample,ifyouconsideraskillsuchas“ProductDiscovery  
Techniques”an8inexpectations,yetyouassessyourproductmanager’s  
currentcapabilityasa4,thenthereisasignificantgapforacriticalskill,  
and you’ll need to get to work coaching the product manager on her  
knowledge or skills in this key area.  
Note\: Normally, the difference between a product manager and  
seniorproductmanager,forexample,iscapturedintheexpectationsof  
wherethelevelofskillsshouldbe\(theexpectationsrating\).Asjustone  
example, I usually rate stakeholder collaboration skills a 7 in expecta-  
tions for a standard product manager-level person, yet I consider this  
skill a 9 for a senior product manager.  
Note\: The level of expectations is always set by the manager, if not  
the organization as a whole. Most of our effort is in determining the  
capability rating. Normally, the assessment of the product manager’s  
capability level is done by the manager. However, there is no reason  
why the product manager can’t also do a self-assessment, and in fact I  
encourage that. But be aware that it is not at all uncommon for the  
self-assessment to expose some significant differences with how the The Assessment **45**  
product manager assesses her own capabilities. A manager that only  
reliesontheself-assessmentbecausesheisuncomfortableconfronting  
thesedifferencesinperceptionis,inmyview,abdicatingherresponsi-  
bility as a manager.  
# The Coaching Plan  
Now that we’ve done a skills assessment and subsequent gap analysis,  
we are looking for the areas with the biggest gaps. That’s the purpose  
of this assessment.  
For the coaching plan, I like to limit the initial focus to the  
top-three areas. After progressing on these, the product person can  
move on to the next most important areas.  
As the manager, you can now provide this product person with  
coaching, training, reading, or exercises intended to develop her skills  
in each area.  
In the next chapter, I will share what I typically recommend in  
a coaching plan for developing each skill in the taxonomy described  
above.Butmanyofyoualreadyknowhowtocoachaproductmanager  
inaspecificskill,soallyoureallyneedistheassessmentandgapanalysis  
described here.  
Also, once an employee has successfully closed the gaps, it  
is the ideal time to show her how the expectation ratings move  
for the next-level position, and she can set about developing and  
demonstrating the skills necessary for a promotion.  
Besuretositdownwitheachofyourproductpeoplenolessthan  
once a week to discuss progress on the coaching plan.  
# Assessments vs. Performance Reviews  
Finally,youmightbewonderinghowthissortofskillsassessmentand  
coaching plan relates to performance reviews. We will discuss perfor-  
mance reviews in more detail in the next part of the book on Staffing.  
In general, I find the way most companies implement perfor-  
mance reviews to be of little use in terms of developing people. Sadly,  
they are more about HR compliance and salary administration. **46** EMPOWERED  
YoumayhavetocomplywithyourHRdepartment’srequirements  
in terms of annual reviews, but just realize that these are in no way an  
adequate substitute for active, ongoing, engaged coaching and devel-  
opment of each team member’s skills.  
One thing to be careful of is that your ongoing efforts to coach  
your employees to be ready for promotion are not the same as being  
abletograntthatpromotion.Manycompanieshavepoliciesregarding  
when promotions can be granted, so you don’t want to set expecta-  
tions with your employee that you can’t deliver on. The way I phrase  
this with the employee is that I will make every effort to prepare the  
employee for promotion, and then I will advocate for that promotion,  
but I can’t always guarantee if and when that promotion will happen.  
Thegoodnewsisifyouactivelymanagetheskillsassessmentand  
the coaching plan as I describe here, then the annual review fire drill  
will be much easier. **CHAPTER**

# User and Customer Knowledge  
There really is no substitute for getting out of the office and visiting  
usersandcustomers.Thatsaid,thereismuchtobegainedbyfirsttak-  
ing advantage of the knowledge of your colleagues.  
As you go about this learning, remember that each person you  
speak with brings their own perspective, and you’re looking to under-  
stand that perspective and learn as many perspectives as possible.  
Ifyourcompanyhasauserresearchteam,that’smyfavoriteplace  
to start, and it is a valuable relationship for the product manager to  
establish.Userresearchersaretheretoeducateyou—theyknowifyou  
don’t truly grok the issues, then you won’t fix them.  
Next, if you have a customer success or customer service team,  
that is a terrific resource. You want to learn who their favorite cus-  
tomersare,andtheirleastfavorite,andwhy.Youwillalsowanttospend  
quality time with this team to understand more about how customers  
perceive your product. But for now, you want to learn what they can  
teach you about your users and customers.  
Product marketing is another valuable perspective on users and  
customers, and another important relationship for the product man-  
agertoestablish.Productmarketingwillalsohavegoodinsightintothe  
broader sales and marketing organizations and the people you should  
talk with who will have useful perspectives.  
In many companies, the founders or CEO have had more  
customer exposure than anyone, and they are another great resource. The Coaching Plan **49**  
Ask the founders which customers they consider the most helpful for  
you to truly get to know and understand. You’re not only looking  
for happy customers, just as you’re not only looking for unhappy  
customers. You’re after as many perspectives as you can get.  
Atthispoint,you’rereadytogooutthereandmeetrealusersand  
customers.  
To set your expectations, when I \(Marty\) first took responsibility  
for a new B2B product, my manager wanted me to visit 30 customers  
\(and further, he insisted that half be from outside the United States\)  
beforemakinganymeaningfuldecisions.Idon’tthinkthatthenumber  
30isspecial,butIcantellyouit’snotjust2or3.Itypicallyrecommend  
at least 15 customer visits as part of new PM onboarding.  
When I returned from that trip, I had progressed from knowing  
virtually nothing to knowing as much as anyone in our organization. I  
leveraged what I learned—and the people I met and the relationships  
I established—for years.  
Once you’re actually sitting down with users and customers, a  
whole other topic is the techniques we use to learn, but that’s the  
discovery techniques topic. With every interaction, at the very least,  
you’re looking to learn\: Are the customers who you think they are?  
Do they have the problems you think they have? How do they solve  
that problem today? What would it take to get them to switch?  
Note that there are some obvious differences between customers  
that are businesses versus consumers, but the principle is the same in  
either case.  
Note also that if you are joining an existing team with a skilled  
product designer and tech lead, then you absolutely want to learn as  
muchfromthemaspossible.Andifyou’rejoininganewteam,thenyou  
want to include these two key people with you during your learning.  
# Data Knowledge  
Therearegenerallythreetypesof dataandtoolsthat thenewproduct  
manager will need to achieve competence on. There is typically  
one tool that contains the data about how users interact with your  
product—user analytics. Another tool typically contains data about  
the sales cycle for your product—sales analytics. And a third typically  
shows how this data is changing over time—data warehouse analytics. **50** EMPOWERED  
Realize that achieving competence for each of these tools means

# Industry and Domain Knowledge  
In general, the product manager is expected to become competent on  
thedomain.Thisis,ofcourse,differentforeveryproduct.Mediaprod-  
ucts are different from developer products, which are different from  
advertising-technology products. Fortunately, in most cases, there is a  
wealth of easily accessible knowledge just an internet search away.  
However,withcertainproductsinveryspecializeddomains\(such  
astaxation,surgicaldevices,andregulatorycompliance\),therewillusu-  
ally be an in-house resource available to all of the product managers  
whoisanacknowledgedexpertonthedomain.Thesepeoplearesome-  
times called subject matter experts or domain experts, and this person is  
another important relationship for the product manager to establish.  
ThePMisnotexpectedtobecomeasknowledgeableaboutthedomain  
as these experts, but she does need to learn enough to engage and col-  
laborate effectively.  
In terms of broader tech industry knowledge, there are many  
industry analysts that provide analysis and insights.1  
1I’ve long been a fan of www.stratechery.com and recommend this resource to all product  
managers and product leaders. The Coaching Plan **51**  
Key to industry knowledge is identifying which industry trends  
are expected to be relevant to the PM’s product. The first step is to  
identify the trends, and then there may be some education needed to  
understand what the trend or technology enables and what the capab-  
ilities and limitations may be.  
Also included in industry knowledge is competitive analysis.  
Product marketing is a good resource to get started here, but the  
product manager will need to have a deeper understanding of the  
offerings, vision, and strategy of each of the major players in the  
landscape.  
WhenIcoachproductmanagersoncompetitiveanalysis,Iliketo  
ask the PM to evaluate the top three to five players in the space and  
to write up a narrative comparing and contrasting the strengths and  
weaknesses of each player—highlighting opportunities.  
# Business and Company Knowledge  
For most new product managers, understanding how their own busi-  
ness works requires the greatest amount of work. But this is often the  
essential difference between competent product managers and those  
who are not.  
One way I like to get started on this is to have the new product  
manager fill out a business model canvas \(any of the variants are fine  
forthis\)fortheirproduct.Itisaquickandeasywaytohelptheproduct  
manager quickly realize the areas she may not yet understand.  
# Sales and Marketing—Go-To-Market  
The go-to-market strategy is an essential aspect of every product.  
This describes how our product makes it into the hands of users and  
customers. It applies to every type of product—from consumer to  
enterprise—but it’s usually most involved when selling to businesses.  
Your product may get sold through a direct sales force, or an indirect  
channel such as resellers, or directly to your customers.  
Thesalesprocessstartswithmarketing,whichitselfhasmanydif-  
ferent strategies and techniques. Ultimately, there’s always some type  
offunnelstartingwithpeoplebecomingawareyouexist,andhopefully **52** EMPOWERED  
proceeding through to the point where they are an active user and  
customer.  
The new PM needs to understand the entire funnel from aware-  
ness to trials to onboarding. It’s especially important to understand  
the capabilities and limitations of the sales channel. Your colleagues  
in product marketing are normally your go-to resource for learning  
about your go-to-market strategy.  
# Finance—Revenue and Costs  
It’s also essential for the new product manager to gain a deep under-  
standingofthefinancialsregardingherproduct.Thisinvolvesboththe  
revenue side as well as costs.  
I’ve long advocated making a friend in finance for this purpose.  
There is a set of financial-related KPIs for every product, and you  
need to first understand what those KPIs are \(e.g., lifetime value of  
the customer\), and what they mean \(e.g., how is lifetime value calcu-  
lated?\). Finally, you need to learn where your product stands \(e.g., is  
your lifetime value sufficient compared to your cost to acquire new  
customers?\).2  
# Legal—Privacy and Compliance  
Another critical aspect to your business is legal. These issues mainly  
relatetoprivacy,security,compliance,andincreasingly,ethics.Aswith  
finance, establishing a relationship with someone in legal who can  
help the new PM understand legal constraints is important—not just  
in coming up to speed, but also when considering new product ideas.  
# Business Development—Partnerships  
Mostproductstodayinvolvesomenumberofpartnerships.Itmaybea  
technology partner that’s used to deliver your products or services, or  
it may be a sales or marketing partnership to acquire new customers.

about which analytics are important to their type of product. The Coaching Plan **53**  
Whateverthepurpose,theseagreementsusuallycomealongwith  
constraints about what we can do, so it’s important for the product  
manager to understand these contracts and constraints.  
# Additional Areas  
Theareasabovearecommontoalmosteveryproduct,butit’salsotrue  
that many products have one or more additional areas, depending on  
the nature of the company.  
Ifthecompanyisstructuredaroundmultiplebusinessunits,then  
these business unit leaders \(e.g., GMs\) are critical stakeholders.  
Similarly, media companies have editorial/content; e-commerce  
companies have merchandising; hardware or device companies have  
manufacturing; and companies that sell globally have international, as  
just a few examples.  
# Product Operational Knowledge  
This topic really should be obvious, but I can’t tell you how often I  
meet a productmanagerwhodoesn’tactuallyknowtheirown product  
beyondhowtogiveabasicdemo.Buthopefullyit’sclearthataproduct  
manager must be an expert user of her own product in order to be  
trusted.  
For consumer products, it is not usually very hard to become  
expert on the product’s use, but for products for businesses this can  
be much more difficult—especially when the product manager lacks  
the domain knowledge.  
Coming up to speed on this typically involves reading whatever  
user or customer documentation exists, taking whatever training  
classes may exist, spending time with customer service staff, and if at  
all possible, using your own products on a daily basis \(this is known as  
dogfooding\).

# Process Skills and Techniques  
There are countless process-related skills and techniques, and new  
techniques are always emerging. The main objective for those of us  
responsible for coaching product managers is to make sure the PM is  
knowledgeableabouttechniquesthataresuitableforthetasksathand.  
# Product Discovery Techniques  
At a minimum, the new PM must understand the four different types  
of product risk \(value, usability, feasibility, and viability\), the different  
forms of prototypes to tackle these risks, and how to test those risks  
qualitatively and quantitatively.  
There are many online resources and training classes, and  
the book INSPIRED goes into detail on these product discovery  
techniques.  
When I coach PMs, I typically have them read the book, and  
then I like to make sure they understand the techniques by describing  
different scenarios and asking the PM how she would address them.  
I’m looking to make sure she is thinking about risk appropriately,  
and that she understands the strengths and limitations of each  
technique.  
# Product Optimization Techniques  
For products that are in production and have significant traffic, there  
are important techniques referred to as product optimization techniques  
thattheproductmanagerneedstounderstandandknowhowtoeffec-  
tively utilize.  
This typically involves learning one of the commercial tools and  
then running an ongoing series of A/B tests—mostly to optimize the  
product funnel, but it could be used for other purposes as well.  
# Product Delivery Techniques  
In general, product delivery techniques are the focus of the engineers  
on the team. However, it’s important for the product manager to The Coaching Plan **55**  
understand the delivery techniques that are being used \(e.g., continu-  
ous delivery\), and in some cases—such as release planning—to take a  
more active role.  
For example, for certain large product changes, a parallel  
deployment may be called for. The product manager needs to know  
what these techniques entail—especially the additional engineering  
costs—to make suitable decisions regarding delivery.  
# Product Development Process  
The decision as to which development process the engineers use to  
develop and deliver software is up to the engineers and engineering  
leadership. However, the PM does play a role in the process, and she  
must understand what her responsibilities are.  
Most teams use some form of Scrum, Kanban, and/or XP  
\(Extreme Programming\) techniques. Often, teams use a blend of  
these.  
I usually recommend that the new PM take a CSPO \(Certified  
ScrumProductOwner\)courseifshehasnotalreadydoneso.Thatsimple  
and short course will explain her responsibilities as the product owner  
for the team.  
Most companies have also standardized on a tool for managing  
theproductbacklog,sothenewPMwillneedtolearnthistoolaswell.  
Note that I have long complained that too many product man-  
agers have only had CSPO training, and then they don’t understand  
why they fail as a product manager. Hopefully it is very clear at this  
point that the CSPO responsibilities, while important, are just a very  
small subset of the responsibilities of the product manager of an  
empowered product team.

develop their people skills. But they do have to want to improve.

# Team Collaboration Skills  
Modern product management is all about true collaboration between  
product,design,andengineering.Thisbeginswithensuringtheprod-  
uct manager is knowledgeable about the real contribution of product  
design and engineering.  
The PM does not need to be personally skilled in either design  
or engineering \(most aren’t, although many PMs believe they’re great  
designers\), but they do need to understand and appreciate their con-  
tributions to the point where they understand that what design and  
engineeringbringtothetableisjustasessentialaswhatthePMbrings.  
Next, the PM needs to establish the relationships necessary for  
true collaboration, which is built on trust and respect.  
InmyowncoachingofPMs,oncethey’velearnedthebasicswe’ve  
discussedabove,mostofthecoachingIdohastodowithcollaboration.  
When I sit down with a product team to talk about a problem  
they’re trying to solve, I rarely spend time with just the PM. Almost  
always, it is with the PM, the product designer, and the tech lead.  
Again, that’s just the nature of product today. But during these  
sessions, I am witness to countless interactions. And afterward, if I’ve  
observedsomething,IoftenpullthePMasideandtrytopointouthow  
her interactions during that meeting either helped or hurt her efforts  
to build trust.  
A one-hour meeting discussing a problem or objective will usu-  
ally yield many good examples I can use as a coaching opportunity for  
the PM. How engaged is the rest of the team? Are they acting like  
theyareempoweredtosolvetheproblem,oraretheyactinglikeorder  
takers?Isthedesignerandengineerbringingpotentialsolutionstothe The Coaching Plan **57**  
table or just pointing out issues with whatever the PM proposed? Are  
they spending too much time talking \(e.g., planning\) and not enough  
time trying \(e.g., prototyping\)? How are they resolving differences of  
opinion?  
# Stakeholder Collaboration Skills  
Many of the points regarding team collaboration skills also apply to  
stakeholdercollaborationskills,butit’sactuallyeasiertobuildtrustand  
relationshipswithyourownteammates\(e.g.,yourdesignerandengin-  
eers\)becauseyouinteractwiththemeveryday—focusedonsolvingthe  
same problem.  
There are additional dynamics at play with stakeholders. First of  
all, while most PMs are individual contributors, most stakeholders are  
company executives. They are often very knowledgeable about their  
part of the business, and they are often used to giving orders.  
The key to successful working relationships with stakeholders is  
establishing mutual trust.  
For the PM, that starts with putting in the time and effort to  
understandwhateachofthestakeholder’sconstraintsare.Wediscussed  
this under BusinessandCompanyKnowledgeabove.  
But once the PM has put in that effort, she needs to personally  
convince each stakeholder that she understands what they are con-  
cernedwith,andthatshe’llmakeeveryefforttocomeupwithsolutions  
that work for them.  
And in any case, whenever she identifies something that might  
be of concern, she will preview those solutions with that stakeholder  
before the team builds anything.  
Building this trust takes time, as there are less interactions, and  
each interaction carries more weight.  
Again, in my work with product teams, I often observe  
PM/stakeholder interactions and there are many good coaching  
opportunities.I try to reinforcethe actions that helpedbuildtrust and  
point out alternative approaches for actions that diminish trust.  
# Evangelism Skills  
Especially in medium to large-sized companies, so much of product  
involves persuasion. This involves convincing your team and your **58** EMPOWERED  
stakeholders that you understand what you need to do, and you’ve got  
a solid plan to deliver.  
My favorite technique for developing a strong and compelling  
argument is the written narrative, which is discussed in Chapter 11,  
The Written Narrative.  
IalsoencouragePMstotakeapresentationskillsclasswhereyour  
presentationsarevideorecordedandyouareprovidedprofessionalcri-  
tiques.I’vepersonallytakenthisclasstwiceovermycareerandconsider  
it invaluable.  
# Leadership Skills  
Finally, so much of strong product management is actually about  
leadership.  
LeadershipskillsareespeciallyimportantforthePMbecausethe  
product team and the stakeholders don’t report to you, so you must  
depend on persuasion and leadership.  
Which is to say, for the PM, leadership must be earned. It does  
not come with the title.  
But this is also why so many strong product managers go on to  
become successful heads of product and CEOs.  
So,howdoyoudeveloptheseleadershipskills?Theprerequisites  
are the items above. If you’ve done your homework and demonstrated  
your knowledge and skills, and you have earned the trust and respect  
of your team and your stakeholders, you are well on your way.  
Beyond this, I encourage all product managers to become life-  
long students of leadership. Most of us know people we consider ter-  
ribleleaders.Someofusareluckyenoughtoknowpeopleweconsider  
exceptionally strong leaders. Discussing the defining characteristics of  
each makes for excellent coaching discussions.  
# Coaching Tech Leads  
I absolutely love coaching tech leads. More often than not, these are  
the people behind the world’s most impressive innovations. The Coaching Plan **59**  
A tech lead is essentially a senior-level engineer who has taken  
on the additional responsibility of participating in the ongoing prod-  
uct discovery work. The tech lead is the key partner to the product  
manager and product designer.  
They are asked to care not just about building and delivering  
reliable products, but also to care about whatgets built.  
Tech leads bring deep knowledge of the enabling technologies,  
andwhenthatknowledgeiscombinedwithadirectunderstandingof  
the customer’s pain and problems, magic can result.  
If you’ve spent any real time with engineers, you know that not  
allengineersareinterestedinanythingbeyondcoding,andthat’sfine.  
We don’t need every engineer to become a tech lead.  
I will say that many of my favorite product companies try to  
screen for this when they interview engineers—they want engineers  
who care just as much about whatthey build as howthey build it. But  
eventhesecompaniesmakeexceptions.It’sonlyaproblemifyoudon’t  
haveatleastonesuchpersononaproductteam,especiallyifyouhope  
to be an empowered product team.  
AsurprisingpercentageofthetechleadsI’vecoachedhavetold  
me that, ultimately, they would like to one day start a company of  
their own. I strongly encourage this and point out to them the many  
successful CEOs in tech who started as engineers. When this is their  
goal,Ioftenencouragethetechleadtoconsidertheproductmanage-  
ment role for a year or two. Even if they go back to engineering, this  
experience is invaluable and positions them much better for a startup  
co-founder role.  
No matter what their career goals, the real potential of a tech  
lead comes from combining their understanding of technology with  
an appreciation for the issues customers struggle with.  
Ialwaysencouragetechleadstovisitasmanycustomersasthey  
can. But I also try to make a point—after visiting an interesting cus-  
tomer myself—to stop by and chat with the tech leads about what I  
saw and learned, and what they might think about that.  
The bottom line is I have found that every single minute you  
investincoachingatechleadoneithercustomersorbusinesscontext  
will be among the best possible uses of your time. **60** EMPOWERED  
# Coaching Product Designers  
Product designers have an especially difficult job. There are many  
design-related skills, and while the product designer does not need  
to be an expert in all of them, she does need to have a considerably  
broad range of knowledge and skills\:  
• Service design  
• Interaction design  
• Visual design  
• Industrial design \(for physical devices\)  
• Prototyping  
• User research  
Most successful product designers are very strong in at least  
prototyping and interaction design, and they know enough about  
servicedesign,visualdesign,anduserresearchtoleveragetherelevant  
techniques and people where necessary.  
As a design manager, your product designers often come from  
different backgrounds, so much of your coaching time will be spent  
helping the product designer address the gaps.  
The other important responsibility to keep in mind for design  
managers is that they are the frontline for ensuring a holistic view  
of design. This means that, while there may be many product  
teams—each with a skilled product designer—the design managers  
need to ensure that the experience works as a whole, across teams.  
Design managers ensure a holistic view by reviewing designs  
at the weekly one-on-ones and by holding design sessions with the  
broader group of product designers, especially to discuss difficult  
design problems.

Let me be blunt.  
Most product marketers aren’t great at what they do. They are  
goodatgettingalotofstuffdone,butit’snotalwaysclearit’smaking  
a difference. The talent of the people in the role is also uneven, con-  
tributing to its reputation—somewhere between ho-hum and occa-  
sionally great.  
Product marketing is not\: managing a checklist of everything  
needed to get done for launch, project management, or just being a  
facilitator between product and sales. The classic understanding of  
product marketing is first you build a product, then bring it to mar-  
ket. The failure in this approach is companies just explain what their  
product does and why it’s different and assume people care.  
Great product marketing requires understanding the market first.

The real indicators of successful product marketing are market  
adoption and momentum. But most people don’t know what to look  
for or when is the right time to start doing product marketing.  
Take Company Z. They’re real, but I’m not using names so  
you can think about all the startup stories you know just like theirs.  
They were a brainchild of a team of PhDs who collectively had  
\(continued\) **62** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
decades of expertise among them. After being selected as a finalist at  
a well-respected technology competition, they decided it was time to  
bring their idea to market.  
Their technology was impressive. A prominent analyst wrote  
about its effectiveness, noting they had never seen anything like it.  
TheyshowedademonstrationtoatopC-suiteexecutiveataFortune  
100company,andhesaid“Thisisamazing.”Theygotventurecapital  
funding based on all this and were off to the races.  
Or so they thought.  
As is common at these early stages, one of their technical  
founderswasthefrontmanforeverything\:sales,product,marketing,  
people. But after six months of meetings with dozens of executives,  
they didn’t have any buyers. So they stopped trying to pitch their  
product at every meeting and instead started asking every executive  
they met what their most pressing priorities were.  
It turned out the problem their technology solved didn’t make  
the top-five, and in some cases, even the top-10 priorities. You might  
wonder why Company Z didn’t start there, but remember, they got  
some early data points that made them think they were on a path to  
create something of value.  
The team realized with a little bit of rework, they could pivot  
theirproductintoamorenimblesolutiontoaproblemthatwasmuch  
higher on these executives’ priority list.  
Their new product intersected with a well-established,  
decades-old category with very mature incumbents. They created an  
easy-to-use setup that could much more quickly give teams answers.  
Armed with this new approach, Company Z created a demo that  
showed what their product could do. They figured since the product  
did so many things, they would show a demo. But this made them  
skip the crucial step of figuring out how to talk about what they did  
succinctly and why people should care.  
Without the right mental anchors, prospective customers still  
struggled to understand why they should pay attention. Company Z  
asked,“Shouldwetalkabouttheregulatoryenvironmentwhichmakes  
what we do more relevant? Do we point out what’s broken with the The Coaching Plan **63**  
older, incumbent software even if we only do a piece of what they do  
much better?”  
Company Z tried to answer these questions by hiring sales-  
people to sell their product. Since they now had salespeople, they  
hiredsomeonewhocould“generatedemand”becausethesalespeople  
needed more names to call. This was a mistake. Without repeatable  
messages, the sales team couldn’t effectively communicate the  
product’s value. Despite a growing go-to-market team, very little  
changed. Less than a handful of customers signed on. At this point,  
nearly two years had gone by.  
Enter “Josie,” their newly hired director of product marketing.  
Shepositionedthemintotheexistingcategorybycarvingoutaniche  
they named that made their focus clear. Within three months, here’s  
what happened\:  
• Awhitepaperarticulatedwhatwasn’tworkingwiththeexisting  
categoryandintroducedtheneedforthenichetheyhadnamed.  
A prominent analyst company was so intrigued by this white  
paper, the analysts in the category all asked to be on a call to  
learn more.  
• She created all new product collateral, bringing more consis-  
tency between the sales deck and the website so they all mes-  
saged the same thing everywhere customers looked.  
• She partnered equally well with product and sales, working in  
lockstep adapting materials as frequently as was necessary. She  
was immediately seen as incredibly valuable by everyone in the  
small company.  
• They declared and agreed on a marketing strategy. This meant  
even if Josie wasn’t the one doing all the work, the rest of the  
teamknewthe‘why’behindeverythingtheyweredoinginmar-

Every person is different, bringing different experience and  
knowledge to the job. In Chapter 8, The Assessment, I discussed a  
tool I use to quickly assess a new product person to determine which  
areas to focus on. But, until the product person is strong enough  
to be considered competent, it is your responsibility to ensure the  
person is not doing harm to her team and is making reasonable  
decisions.  
Normally, this period of close oversight lasts on the order of two  
to three months, and it is a much more intense coaching relationship The One-on-One **67**  
than the ongoing coaching that happens once the product person is  
deemed capable.  
# The Frequency  
This is one of those areas where there’s a range of opinions out there,  
butIfeelstronglythatthe1\:1shouldbenolessthan30minutes,once  
per week, and that this session is sacred and not to be another one of  
those “You okay with skipping this week?” kind of meetings. You may  
need to occasionally reschedule, but don’t cancel. Please consider the  
message this sends.  
For new PMs in the onboarding period who are not yet compe-  
tent, it may be two to three times per week, or even daily.  
Oncethetrustbetweenmanagerandemployeeisestablished,1\:1  
coaching works well with video calls. The key is to establish an envir-  
onment conducive to developing the relationship and having honest,  
constructive discussions.  
# Sharing Context  
If you are to empower your product person to solve problems in the  
best way her team sees fit, as a leader and manager you must provide  
her with the strategic context.  
This means making sure she understands the company’s mission  
andobjectivesfortheyear,theproductvision,theproductstrategyfor  
the broader product, and the team objectives for her particular prod-  
uct team.  
Thebulkofthisdiscussionhappensduringonboarding,buteach  
quarter you’ll need to discuss the upcoming quarter’s specific team  
objectives. Sometimes, those are fairly complicated discussions.  
# Homework  
There’s simply no substitute for the product person doing her home-  
work. It is the foundation for competence, and it’s the main activity  
during the onboarding period. You can guide the product person to **68** EMPOWERED  
the right resources, and answer questions about the material, but it’s  
on the person to spend the time and effort to do her homework and  
gain this knowledge.  
What does homework really mean? For a product manager, it  
means learning the product inside and out. Learning about the users  
and customers. Learning the data. Learning the capabilities of the  
enabling technologies. Learning the industry. Learning the various  
dimensions of the business, especially financial, sales, go-to-market,  
service, and legal.  
# Thinking and Acting Like a Product Person  
Beyond doing homework, coaching is mainly about helping the prod-  
uct person learn to think and act like a strong product person.

# Providing Feedback  
Also known as “tough love” or “radical candor,” honest, constructive  
feedback is the main source of value you provide as manager. Feed-  
back should be frequent and as timely as possible \(at the first oppor-  
tunity to discuss privately\). Remember to praise publicly but criticize  
privately.  
Manymanagersmistakenlybelievethattheonlytimetheyshould  
collect and deliver feedback is at an annual performance review, but  
in truth there are opportunities every day to collect feedback, both  
directly and indirectly. There is usually no shortage of meetings  
with the opportunity to observe the product person’s interactions  
directly.  
Moreover,asthemanager,youshouldalwaysbeseekingconstruc-  
tivefeedbackontheperson—askingtheothermembersoftheproduct  
team about their interactions and asking senior executives, stakehold-  
ers, and business owners about their impressions and suggestions.  
After a while, giving constructive feedback moves from awkward  
to second nature. But until then, force yourself to come up with some  
helpful constructive feedback every week.

# Anti-Patterns  
I could end the chapter here, but I have seen so many managers who  
think they understand and do all this, yet fail to develop their people.  
In my experience, here are the most common reasons for that\:  
# Manager Just Doesn’t Care  
By far the biggest reason I see that people don’t develop and reach  
competence is because so many managers either don’t like develop-  
ing people, or they don’t view it as their primary responsibility. So, it’s  
pushedoffasasecondarytask,ifthat,andthemessagetotheemployee  
is clear\: You’re on your own.  
# Manager Reverts to Micromanaging  
It’s actually easier for you to simply issue specific instructions and  
micromanage—to just give the person a list of tasks to do, and if any  
real decisions need to be made, to bring them to your attention and  
you’ll make the call. It’s beyond the scope of this chapter for me to list  
all the reasons why this results in disappointment, but in any case, it  
won’t develop the people we need, and it’s not a scalable solution.  
# Manager Spends Time Talking and Not Listening  
While there’s nothing wrong with preparing for the session by jotting  
down some notes of items to discuss, it’s critical to keep in mind that  
this session is primarily for the product person and not for you. It’s  
all too easy for you to talk for 30 minutes straight, and then you’re  
out of time. Moreover, it’s important to recognize that people learn in  
different ways, and you’ll learn that by listening not talking.  
# Manager Doesn’t Provide Difficult Feedback  
It’s true that learning to give frank, honest, constructive feedback is  
hard for many people. But if it’s not done, the person doesn’t grow  
and improve at the pace we need. This usually becomes very clear at The One-on-One **71**  
the next performance review, where the employee is surprised by the  
negative feedback.  
Just to be perfectly clear here, at the performance review,nothing  
should be a surprise—everything should have already been discussed in  
depth, likely for months. The performance review is discussed in an  
upcoming chapter, as it’s the source of lots of grief and angst for all  
parties. But, for now, the important thing to keep in mind is that it is  
never the key tool for developing people—the weekly 1\:1 is.  
# Manager Is Insecure and/or Incompetent  
This technique is predicated on you as manager being competent  
yourself \(otherwise, how would you be able to coach others to  
competence?\), you are secure enough in your own contributions and  
value that you are happy to shine a light on others when they do well,  
and you don’t feel threatened by their success. But sadly, we all know  
of managers where, for whatever reason, this is not the case. The  
person responsiblefor ensuring strong people managers is the head of  
product in a larger company and the CEO in a startup.  
As we discussed earlier, if you don’t personally have the neces-  
saryexperiencetocoachanddevelopothers,itwillbeessentialforyou  
to immediately find some product leader coaching for yourself. Please  
don’t take this responsibility lightly.  
# Manager Doesn’t Cut Losses  
I hesitate to include this one because to me this is the last resort. But  
sometimes we have a manager that has been working sincerely, tire-  
lessly,andcapablyforseveralmonthstocoachtheperson,yetshecan’t  
seem to get the product person to competence.  
It’simportanttorealizethatnoteveryoneiscutouttobeaproduct  
person. When I find this to be the case, it’s usually because the person  
was simply reassigned from a different role at the company—maybe  
becausethispersonusedtobeacustomerandknewtheproductorthe  
domain, or knew the CEO, or whatever—but she simply doesn’t have  
the core foundation to succeed in the role.  
Moreover, hopefully it’s clear that the product roles of product  
manager, product designer, and tech lead are not “junior” roles. **72** EMPOWERED

outfortheproductpersonrole.Andthisisalsonotscalable.Youneed  
people that can be developed into capable and competent product  
people—that can be given an objective and then counted on to find a  
way to get it done.  
My view in this case is that you are responsible for getting the  
new product person to competence. If you’re not able to accomplish  
this in a reasonable period of time \(usually three to six months\), then

# Narrative  
**I**n the previous chapter, I talked about the importance of the 1\:1  
coaching session between a manager and her employee. That tech-  
niqueis aboutprovidinganongoing mechanismforhelpingthe prod-  
uct person reach her potential.  
Inthischapter,I’dliketodiscussmysinglefavoritecoachingtool

ButfirstIneedtoadmitthatofallthevariouscoachingtechniques  
Ihaveanduse,thisonegetsmoreresistancethananyothertechnique.  
Infact,withmorethanafewpeopleIhavehadtoessentiallyforcethem  
to use it.  
It’s not so much that people doubt the effectiveness, it’s just that  
it can often be painful. And I’ve found that the people who need this  
technique the most are often the ones who resist it the most.  
Productpeople,especiallyproductmanagers,havetomakeargu-  
ments all the time. Not so much for minor things, but once things  
become costly and risky—good examples include large features and  
**73** **74** EMPOWERED  
projects, and especiallysignificant new efforts—there will naturallybe  
manypeoplewhowillquestionandchallengethework.Usually,it’sthe  
executivesfromacrossthecompany,butitoftenstartswithconvincing  
your own team.  
ThetechniqueI’mtalkingaboutiswritingoutanarrativeexplain-  
ing your argument and recommendation.  
Tobeclear,Iamnottalkingaboutaspecofanysort.Aspecisnot  
intended to be a persuasive piece—it’s just a document describing the  
details of what you want built.  
Rather, I’m talking about a roughly six-page document that  
describes in narrative form the problem you’re trying to solve, why  
this will be valuable for your customers and for your business, and  
your strategy for solving the problem. If this narrative is done well,  
the reader will be both inspired and convinced.  
Onecompanythathasmadethiswrittennarrativethecoreofhow  
they operate and innovate is Amazon. They have embraced this tech-  
nique more than any other company I know, and I don’t think it’s a  
coincidence that they are one of the world’s most consistently innova-  
tive companies.  
Here’s the thing. It’s not hard for you as product person, in some  
kickoffmeeting,toshowaPowerPointpresentation,waveyourhands,  
toss out some data points, and sound enthusiastic and confident. And  
then watch as the meeting degenerates into design by committee, or  
just as bad, everyone gets frustrated and just turns to the highest-paid  
person in the room for direction.  
When this happens, it’s clear to me that the product person did  
not do the necessary homework. The person doesn’t truly know the  
topic. The argument is weak. The person has not sufficiently consid-  
ered and addressed the various perspectives and constraints.  
What the written narrative does is make this obvious.  
We’veallseenproductpeoplestandupandbluster,andpretendto  
know what they’re talking about. But with the written narrative, there  
is no faking it.  
As former Netscape engineer and longtime Amazonian Brad  
Porter puts it, “Speed and scale are weapons, and Amazon has  
already told everyone its secret… if only they have the discipline to  
implement it.”1  
1Brad Porter at https\://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beauty-amazons-6-pager-brad-porter/. The Written Narrative **75**  
Despite Amazon’s 25-year record of consistent technology-  
powered innovation, most product people I know would do nearly  
anything to avoid having to write out this type of narrative analysis  
and recommendation. Yet, it’s one of the most valuable things they  
could do to both move faster and make better decisions.  
This is why I emphasized the one-on-one technique first. Very  
fewproductpeoplehavethedisciplinetodothiswrittennarrativeand  
confronttheglaringholesintheirargumentsalone.However,theman-  
ager can coach the product person through this process.

and objections that might come from key executives and stakeholders,  
takethetimetoconsiderandwriteupclearanswerstotheseobjections,  
and then review these responses with the people that have these con-  
cerns. When the executive later reads this narrative, she can see that  
you anticipatedthe issues and consideredthe response, and she knows  
that you have done your homework.  
You might use this narrative to kick off decision meetings like  
Amazon does. Or, even if you decide you want to do that PowerPoint  
presentation, I promise you that if you first do a good job on the writ-  
ten narrative, then your presentation will be very easy to create and  
will flow directly from the narrative. The presentation will be much  
better for it, and your visible preparation on the material will leave  
your audience justifiably impressed.  
Ihadtobeconvincedofthismyselfearlyinmycareer,andI’mjust  
gratefulthatIhadamanagerwhopushedmewelloutsidemycomfort

If you’ve never tried this technique before, on your next signif-  
icant effort, I hope you’ll give the written narrative technique a try.  
Expectittobeuncomfortable.Besuretoincorporatethe perspectives  
of the members of your team and key stakeholders. Spend the time to

# Strategic Context  
**T**o continue with our series on coaching, in this chapter I cover a  
different aspect of coaching\: ensuring the product team has the  
necessaryunderstandingofthebroaderbusinesscontextinwhichthey  
are operating.  
I refer to this information as the strategic context, and as you’ll  
see, this includes several important and major topics, all of which I  
will discuss in depth elsewhere. But, together, these topics form the  
understanding necessary for teams to make good choices.  
If product teams are to be empowered to make decisions, they  
need to have the context necessary to make these decisions. This stra-  
tegiccontexttypicallycomesfromtheproductleadersofthecompany  
but needs to be deeply understood by the product team, especially the  
product manager.  
Normally, the strategic context is part of the onboarding for any  
new product person joining the organization.  
Note\: In this chapter, I use the term “company” to represent the  
largerbusinessentity,butinverylargecompanies,theremaybeseveral  
businessunitsordivisionswherethisstrategiccontextmaybedifferent  
**76** Strategic Context **77**  
for each. As an example, Google’s YouTube business unit has a very  
different strategic context than their AdWords business unit.  
Generally, there are six types of strategic context.  
# Company Mission  
Simply put, this is the purpose of the company. It is meant to commu-  
nicate to everyone involved why we are here. This is usually a simple  
statement,andit’sintendedtobedurable—usuallylastingforadecade  
or more, if not the life of the company.  
Ifanyemployeedoesnotknowthemissionofthecompany,then  
thatwouldbeanobvioussignthatsomethingisseriouslywronginthe  
culture and/or the leaders.  
But, while it’s common that everyone knows the purpose of the  
company, many people may not know how they personally are able to  
contribute to that mission. **78** EMPOWERED  
# Company Scorecard  
Everyproductandeverycompanyhavesomekeyperformanceindica-  
tors \(KPIs\) that help provide an understanding of the overall picture  
andhealthofthebusiness,referredtohereasthecompany scorecard,but  
sometimes called the company dashboard or the health metrics. In some  
cases, these may be fairly straightforward, and other times they can be  
quite complex.  
Asanexample,inatwo-sidedmarketplace,thereareusuallysome  
critical KPIs that tell us whether our marketplace is healthy, meaning  
that both sides receive value, and the marketplace is in balance.  
As an obvious example of an unhealthy marketplace, suppose  
you had a jobs marketplace with employers posting jobs and job  
seekers searching for work. But imagine you had thousands of people  
comingeverydaytosearchforjobs,butalmostnojobswereavailable.  
The job seekers would be frustrated and likely would leave to go  
elsewhere.  
And, of course, in a two-sided job marketplace, we would have  
at least two funnels—one to bring in job seekers and one to bring in  
employers—and we’d closely watch the key metrics for each funnel.  
Thecompanyscorecardcapturesthesebusinessdynamics.Itdoes  
not focus on every metric, but it focuses on the most important and  
informative metrics. It is how the leaders of the company judge the  
overall health and performance of the company.  
# Company Objectives  
Onceweunderstandthecompanyscorecard,wecandiscussthespecific  
objectives the company is focused on for this year.  
These objectives are selected by the senior leadership team, usu-

Hopefully everyone understands that these company objectives  
must be outcomes \(business results\), and not output \(such as delivering  
on specific projects\).

# Product Vision and Principles  
Ultimately, the way we deliver on a company’s mission is to develop  
productsandservicesforourcustomers.Theproductvisionishowwe  
hope to do that.  
Normally, the product vision is somewhere between 3 years and  
10 years out and describes the future we are trying to create, and why  
that future will improve the lives of our customers.  
The mission may provide the purpose, but it’s the vision that  
begins to make this tangible. It’s worth noting that the product vision  
is also our single best tool for recruiting strong product people.  
Thisiswhatthesepeoplewillbeworkingoneverydayforseveral  
years,soitneedstobeinspiring.Yetit’salsoimportantthattheproduct  
visionnotbetoospecificbecauseweknowwecan’tyetknowthedetails.  
We will be going deep into product vision in Part IV, but this is  
whatempoweredproductteamswillbefiguringout\:howtomakethis  
vision a reality.  
Theproductprinciplescomplementtheproductvisionbystating  
the values and beliefs that are intended to inform the many product  
decisions that will need to be made.  
So many decisions revolve around trade-offs, and the product  
principles help to illuminate the values we prioritize when we make  
these trade-offs.  
The product teams need to understand these principles and the  
reasoning behind each one. **80** EMPOWERED  
# Team Topology  
The team topology \(covered in Part V\) describes what each product  
team is responsible for. It’s important for each of the product teams  
to understand where they sit in the larger picture, and how their team  
relates to the other teams.  
# Product Strategy  
The product strategy is where things start to become more specific.  
We have a set of company objectives that we are all here to help  
achievethisyear,wehaveaproductvisionthatweneedmultipleyears  
to achieve, and we also generally have multiple product teams—each  
with different skills and areas of responsibility.  
The product strategy connects these concepts. It is the product  
strategy that will drive each specific product team’s objectives.  
How product strategy does this is a major topic of this book  
\(Part VI\).

# Sense of Ownership  
**T**he previous several chapters have provided a set of coaching tools  
andtechniquesdesignedtohelpyougetyourproductmanagersto  
competence.  
However, in this and the next several chapters I would like to  
explore coaching behavior and mindset.  
A strong product person is not just competent in terms of  
knowledge and skills, she also has an effective product mindset and  
consistently demonstrates good judgment in her decisions and her  
interactions.  
In this chapter, I discuss an important mindset for a product per-  
son, which is the difference between thinking like an owner versus  
thinking like an employee.  
I want to acknowledge up front that this chapter touches on a  
sensitive subject for many people, because the topic can quickly get  
personal—especially for those who have grown up in countries with  
different attitudes toward work and its role in one’s life.  
**81** **82** EMPOWERED  
ButthisiswhyIneedtoremindeveryonethatI’mallaboutshar-  
ing the practices and techniques from what I consider the best tech  
product teams in the world.  
I’m not trying to share what most companies do \(you learned in  
the preface what I think of how most companies work\). I’m trying to  
sharebestpractice.I’malsotryingtojudgebestbyobjectiveresultsand  
not by subjective standards.  
With those caveats, many product leaders have heard the phrase  
“we want to hire product people that think like an owner and not like  
anemployee,”butwhatdoesthatreallymean?Andjusthowimportant  
is this really?  
In Jeff Bezos’s original 1997 letter to shareholders, he stated\:  
Wewillcontinuetofocusonhiringandretainingversatileandtalented  
employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options  
rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our  
ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom  
mustthinklike,andthereforemustactuallybe,anowner.1  
Hereiteratedthiscriticalpointyetagaininhismostrecentshare-  
holder letter.2  
Jeff Bezos is trying to tell us all something extremely important,  
and that one of the most important things a good manager can help  
develop in her product people is an owner’s mindset.  
So, let’s consider this “think like an owner” concept.  
Thisissimilartothemissionariesnotmercenariesconcept,butin  
truth,it’snottoohardtogetexcitedaboutsomethingmeaningful—like  
a compelling product vision—yet not think like an owner.  
So, while I think most owners act like missionaries, not all mis-  
sionaries act like owners.  
You know now that creating empowered product teams involves  
givingproductteamsownershipofaproblemtosolve,sothattheyhave  
the ability to solve problems the best way they see fit.

Now,I’mnotclaimingthisisverbatim,butIdothinkitisafairly

an employee, it’s very much the same message I try to pass along to  
product people I coach.  
IfIhadtoboilitalldown,I’dsaythatthinkinglikeanownerver-  
sus thinking like an employee is primarily about taking responsibility  
for the outcome rather than just the activities.  
Interestingly, I often try to convince exceptional designers and  
engineers to consider moving to product management. And while I’ve  
had some good success with that, the single most common objection  
I hear is an unwillingness to take responsibility for outcomes \(and the  
pressure that implies\).  
Iunderstandandrespecttheirchoiceonthat,butIdoagreewith  
Jeff Bezos that this is an important mindset, especially for product  
managers. Sense of Ownership **85**  
# The Power of Equity  
When discussing thinking like an owner, it’s important to acknowl-  
edge that this entire discussion is directly related to the stock com-  
pensation topic.  
Stockcompensationisdesignedsothatyouareliterallyanowner,  
not just thinking like one.  
Ibelieveit’snotatallanaccidentthatthetoptechproductcom-  
panies in the world use equity, either in the form of stock options or  
grants, to spread ownership.  
It’s no secret that this is a big contributor to the innovation  
enginethatpowersSiliconValley.Manypeoplethinktheequitytopic  
onlyappliestostartups,butitappliestocompaniesofallsizes,includ-  
ing some of the largest and best product companies such as Amazon,  
Google, Netflix, and Apple.  
However,lesswellknownisthat,inmanypartsoftheworld,the  
local tax laws make awarding equity difficult. I can’t help but notice  
that I hear a lot more of the dreaded refrain “that’s not my job” at  
these companies.  
Thereareotherwaysbesidesequitytohaveyourkeyemployees  
share in the actual rewards of product success. The most obvious is a  
company profit-sharing plan.  
But I do think if CEOs want their key people to think and  
behave like owners, they should compensate them like owners.  
Nobody expects that an individual contributor engineer will get the  
same level of equity as a senior vice president, but it doesn’t take  
much to be material if the company does in fact do well.  
Similarly, it’s important to evergreen the equity. What this  
means is that you don’t want people to leave once they have fully  
vested, so you continue to award additional stock to your strong  
performers every year.  
An evergreen strategy with equity means that your best people  
willalwaysfeelliketheywouldbeleavingbehindsubstantialcompen-

However you accomplish it, as a manager, I have always found  
it immensely powerful to be able to point out that the employee is

# Managing Time  
**I**’ve long said that, to get the critically important work of a product  
manager done, you need on the order of four solid hours a day.  
If the person is a product designer or tech lead and is not able to  
spend most of the day doing actually creative work, then you have a  
larger problem. So, this is mainly an issue with product managers.  
To be clear, I’m not talking about email or Slack or meetings. I  
meanqualitytimeworkingoncomingupwithsolutionstothedifficult  
problems we’re trying to solve—otherwise known as product discovery.  
Still, that doesn’t sound too bad, until you look at your calendar  
andrealizethatyouronlychanceforthosefourhoursisfrom6\:00p.m.  
until 10\:00 p.m. at night \(and hence the infamous 60-hour workweek  
of so many product managers\).  
You’veallseenthefrenziedproductmanagerthatspendshertime

having any time to do “real product work.”

work, rather than product management work.  
Now, they don’t necessarily call it that, but I try to point out to  
them that’s actually what’s going on.  
So, why is this?  
Partlybecausetheworkdoes needtobedone—especiallywhenit’s  
urgent—andtheproductmanagermaynotbelievethereisanyoneelse  
available or able to do it.  
Partlybecausealotofproductmanagershaveneverbeentrained  
or coached on what product management is really all about, and they  
think that’s what the job is.  
And partly because I think many people are actually more com-  
fortable with the project management tasks, as they are tangible and  
much more straightforward, and it can feel productive to check lots of  
things off the list every day.  
Now, it’s important to acknowledge that there’s always some  
amount of project management in every leadership role—engineering  
managers, marketing managers, CEOs—they all need to “herd the  
cats” at times. But that is not what defines those jobs, and that’s not  
what defines the product manager job either.  
Your highest-order contribution and responsibility as product  
manager is to make sure that what the engineers are asked to build  
will be worth building. That it will deliver the necessary results.  
This means working with designers and engineers to come up  
with solutions that are valuable, usable, feasible, and viable. That is  
product discovery, and that is what takes on the order of four solid  
hours a day.  
Iencourageproductmanagerstoblockoffthistimefortheweek,  
andprotectthattime,andthenyoustillhavehalfadayforotherstuff.  
Ofcourse,theprojectmanagementworkdoesn’tgoaway.Which  
is why my favorite answer to this problem is for the product manager  
to team up with a delivery manager who can take on the project man-  
agement, so the product manager can actually focus on her job.  
But I also know that many product managers, even many good  
ones, aren’t comfortable giving up that responsibility. Managing Time **89**

how product managers can work smarter not harder. That said, even  
with a skilled product manager, using the very latest techniques, you  
still need those four hours.  
Others will argue that work will always expand to fill whatever

# 15  
# Thinking  
**S**o far in this series of chapters on coaching, I’ve described a tool  
for assessing a current or prospective product person, and then  
provided detailed examples of how to craft a coaching plan to help  
the product person first reach competence, and then to reach her full  
potential.  
We’ve discussed the importance of the 1\:1, and we’ve discussed  
the written narrative technique.  
We’ve also looked at coaching not just her skills and techniques,  
but also her mindset, including thinking like an owner rather than an  
employee.  
Inthischapter,I’dliketotackleanotheraspectofmindset,which  
admittedly can be a little awkward to discuss, but is perhaps the single  
most important behavior of a capable product person—the ability to  
think.  
Often people refer to this with the shorthand phrase of looking  
forpeoplethatare“smart.”I’mguiltyofthistoo.Buttheterm“smart”  
is ambiguous and can obscure the real issue.  
**90** Thinking **91**  
When people say “smart,” they are mostly referring to intel-  
ligence.  
First, we need to acknowledge that intelligence and thinking are  
not at all the same thing.  
Idobelievethatinordertothinkeffectively\(andmoregenerally,  
to succeed in a career in product\), you do need to have a certain level  
of intelligence.  
However, I meet countless people who are clearly intelligent, yet  
wastetheirmindsbecausetheydon’tknowhowto\(orareunwillingto\)  
actually solve hard problems by thinking.  
Second, we also need to recognize that acquiring knowledge and  
applying knowledge are two different things.  
Google,andthewealthofresourcesitprovideseasyaccessto,has  
made knowledge easier to acquire than ever before, but has done little  
to help people actually learn to think and apply that knowledge.  
Whyisthinkingsoimportant?Becauseatitscore,productteams  
are all about problem solving.  
OneofthereasonsthatIloveworkingwithdesignersandengin-  
eers so much \(and also why I love to recruit designers and engineers  
into product management\) is that thinking is at the very core of what  
they do.  
Yes,theyaremakers.Butinordertodesignanexperienceorcraft  
an implementation, they must essentially be problem solvers. Design-  
ers and engineers are skilled at solving for problems with many con-  
straints. It is literally what they do every day.  
Similarly, product managers must be problem solvers as well.  
They are not trying to design the user experience, or architect a  
scalable, fault-tolerant solution. Rather, they solve for constraints  
alignedaroundtheircustomer’sbusiness,theirindustry,andespecially  
their own business. Is this something their customers need? Is it  
substantiallybetterthanthealternatives?Isitsomethingthecompany  
can effectively market and sell, that they can afford to build, that they  
can service and support, and that complies with legal and regulatory  
constraints?  
Moreover,oneofthespecialchallengeswithtechnology-powered  
productsandservicesisthatwemustsolvesimultaneouslyforallthree  
types of constraints—product, design, and engineering. Hence the  
need for true collaboration \(the subject of the next chapter\). **92** EMPOWERED  
Obviously, some degree of thinking and problem solving is  
required for any job. But for product managers, designers, and  
engineers, it is the core.  
It’snothardtospotwhenaproductpersonisweakwhenitcomes  
to thinking. While I am a big believer in encouraging questions, this  
presumesthepersonhasdonetheirhomeworkandputintheintellec-  
tualefforttoactuallyconsidertheissuefirst.Alltoooften,itisobvious  
they have not.  
Goodproductcompaniestrytodeterminehowwellthecandidate  
can think and solve problems during the interview process. The issue  
is not whether the candidate actually knows the answer to a question.  
The issue is what does she do when she doesn’t know the answer?  
Which is why critical thinking and problem-solving skills are so  
important.  
My favorite technique for developing good thinking skills is the  
writtennarrativethatIdescribedearlier.Inthatchapter,Iwarnedyou  
that for someone who is not used to actually thinking through hard  
problems,thistechniquecanbetrulypainful.Butthosearethepeople  
that need this technique the most. And for some people, it is here that  
you’ll realize they are not cut out to be a product person.  
But as long as the person has the necessary intelligence, and is  
willingtoputintheintellectualeffort,Ibelievethattheabilitytolearn  
to think and solve hard problems is absolutely something that can be  
developed. However, it will require active coaching and sincere effort  
by the manager and the product person. **CHAPTER**  
# 16  
# Team Collaboration  
**I**n this chapter, I continue the series on coaching product people by  
talking about another critically important skill that is so often mis-  
understood or underappreciated, and that is team collaboration.  
Collaboration is one of those words that is used so often in so  
many different ways that it has lost its meaning for many people. Of  
course, they think they’re collaborative. Few people view themselves  
as anti-collaborative.  
But in the context of an empowered, cross-functional product  
team,beingcollaborativehasaveryspecificmeaning,anditismostdef-  
initelynothowmanypeople,especiallyproductmanagers,areinclined  
to work. So, this is often a criticallyimportant area for the manager to  
focus on during coaching.  
It’s also worth pointing out that when your product team has  
remote employees, this collaboration often suffers, so your coaching  
of collaboration needs to increase for your remote workers.  
In INSPIRED, I talk about the three critical characteristics of  
strong product teams, no matter what processes they use\: the first is  
**93** **94** EMPOWERED  
tacklingrisksearly;thesecondissolvingproblemscollaboratively;and  
the third is being accountable to results.  
Regarding the second critical characteristic—solving problems  
collaboratively—it is no longer the old, waterfall process of a product  
manager defining requirements, and handing them off to a designer  
to come up with a design that meets those requirements, and then  
handing that off to engineers to implement the design.  
So, what do we really mean by collaboration?  
Let’s start by talking about what collaboration is not.  
First, collaboration is not about consensus. While we like it when  
theproductteamagreesonthebestcourseofaction,wedonotexpect  
or insist on this. Rather, we depend on the expertise of each member  
oftheproductteam.Generallyspeaking,ifthetechleadfeelsaspecific  
architectureiscalledfor,wedefertothetechlead.Ifthedesignerfeels  
a specific user experience is called for, we defer to the designer. Occa-  
sionally there will be conflicts and judgment calls, and normally we’ll  
run a test to resolve them.  
Second, collaboration is not about artifacts. Many product man-  
agers think their job is to produce some form of document capturing  
“requirements,”or,attheleast,theyaretheretowriteuserstories.Itis  
true that sometimes we need to create artifacts \(especially when team  
members are remote\), but that is certainly not how we collaborate. In  
fact, these artifacts more often get in the way of actual collaboration.  
Why is that? Because once the product manager has declared  
somethingisa“requirement,”itprettymuchendstheconversationand  
moves the discussion into implementation. At this point, the designer  
feelslikeshe’stheretoensurethatthedesignconformstothecompany  
styleguide,theengineersfeelliketheyaretherejusttocode,andwe’re  
back to Waterfall.  
Third, collaboration is also not about compromise. If you end up  
with a mediocre user experience, slow performance and limited scala-  
bility, and dubious value for customers, as a team you lose.  
We need to find a solution that works. By that we mean that it is  
valuable \(valuable enough that target customers will actually buy it or  
choosetouseit\),itisusable \(souserscanactuallyexperiencethatvalue\),  
itisfeasible \(sowecanactuallydeliverthatvalue\),anditisviable forour  
business \(so the rest of our company can effectively market, sell, and  
support the solution\). Team Collaboration **95**  
In order to do this, we need to know what we can’t know, admit  
what we don’t know, and focus on discovering a solution that works.  
And that requires true collaboration.  
Remember that our job in product is to solve the problems we  
are asked to solve, in ways that our customers love, yet that work for  
our business. That’s our job as an empowered, cross-functional prod-  
uct team, and each member of the team is there because they bring  
necessary skills.  
This all starts with true and intense collaboration between prod-  
uct management, product design, and engineering.  
My favorite way to actually do this is to sit around a prototype  
\(usually created by the designer\) so as a team you can consider and  
discuss the proposed solution on the table. The designer can consider  
different approaches to the experience, the engineers can consider  
implications of different approaches and the potential of different  
enabling technologies, and the product manager can consider the  
impacts and consequences of each potential direction \(e.g., would  
there be privacy violations, or would this be something that would  
work with our sales channel?\).  
Note that while doing product discovery, certain tools and tech-  
niques serve both to facilitate collaboration as well as to provide an  
artifact as an output of that collaboration. Two very popular examples  
of that are prototypes and story maps.  
The very act of creating and discussing prototypes and story  
maps facilitates true collaboration. And if you are diligent about  
keeping your prototype or story map up to date, then they can also  
serve as an artifact—capturing the learning and decisions from the  
discovery work.  
The real benefit and purpose of the tools in this case are in fos-  
tering the collaboration. However, it is a nice side benefit to have an  
artifact at the end.  
It’s not really the prototype that’s critical here, as much as the  
nature of the collaboration that it facilitates.  
Notice that the product manager and engineers aren’t trying to  
tell the designer how to do her job. And the product manager and  
designers are not there to tell the engineers how to do their jobs. And  
the designers and engineers aren’t there to tell the product manager  
how to do her job. **96** EMPOWERED  
Rather, in a healthy and competent team, each member of the  
teamiscountingontheotherstohavedonetheirhomeworkandbring  
the necessary skills to the table.  
Butpleasedon’tmisunderstandthisasdesignersareonlyrespon-  
sible for usability and engineers are only responsible for feasibility,  
because this would miss the real point of collaboration.  
Designersoftenhaveinsightsbasedondeepunderstandingofour  
users and their behaviors that lead us in a different direction in terms  
of the problem we’re solving, or our approach to the problem. These  
insights will often have a big impact on value, and indirect impacts on  
things like performance.  
Similarly, strong engineers have deep insights into the enabling  
technology that often leads us to entirely different solutions to the  
problems we were assigned—often much better than anything the  
product manager, the designer, or especially the customer could have  
imagined.  
IfIhadtopicktheonethingIlovemostaboutthefeelingoftrue  
collaboration on an empowered product team, it is the form of magic  
thathappenswhenyouhavepeoplewhoarea\)motivatedandb\)skilled  
in their respective discipline—product management, product design  
andengineering—andtheysitaroundaprototypeorwatchauserinter-  
act with a prototype. The engineer points out new possibilities, the  
designer points out different potential experiences, and the product  
managerweighsinwiththesales-orfinancial-orprivacy-relatedimpli-  
cations, and after exploring a bunch of approaches, they find one that  
actually works. It’s valuable, it’s usable, it’s feasible, and it’s viable.  
In my experience, there are two situations where this most often  
goes wrong.  
The first is that the product manager has not done her  
homeworkandshedoesn’tknowthevariousaspectsandconstraintsof  
the business—sales, marketing, finance, legal, privacy, and so on—so  
the product team really doesn’t have the information it needs to  
solve the problems it has been assigned \(which usually means they’re  
back to implementing features on a roadmap\).  
That’s why we discussed early in this part on coaching that, as a  
manager,yourfirstpriorityistoassesstheproductmanagerandcreate  
a plan to get her to competence. Team Collaboration **97**  
The second situation is arrogance. If the product manager  
believesthe solutionshealreadyhasin mindisclearlythe best, evenif  
she is right, collaboration is stifled, and she probably now has a team  
of mercenaries rather than missionaries.  
Another important form of collaboration, especially in compa-  
nies with a direct sales force, is engaging with prospective customers  
to determine if your product can meet their needs.  
It is natural for the prospect to try to dictate requirements for  
features, but your job is to work to understand their underlying issues  
and constraints, and then work collaboratively with your prospective  
customerstodetermineifthere’sageneralsolutionthatwillmeettheir  
needs. This form of collaboration is at the heart of the customer dis-  
covery program technique.1  
Collaboration means product managers, product designers, and  
engineersworkingtogetherwithcustomersandstakeholdersandexec-  
utives to come up with a solution that solves for all of our constraints  
and risks. This is what we mean by solutions that our customers love,  
yet work for our business.  
Getting good at true collaboration is at the heart of how strong  
product teams work. It’s a combination of skills and mindset, and it  
oftentakesactivecoachingbythemanagertohelpnewproductpeople  
develop this capability.  
1This technique is described in detail in INSPIRED and is one of the most powerful and  
effective discovery techniques. **CHAPTER**  
# 17  
# Stakeholder  
# Collaboration  
**P**eople on feature teams dread the topic of stakeholders, especially  
product managers and product designers. They view these people  
as at worst dictatorial, or at best as obstacles to deal with.  
This is yet another very clear example of the difference between  
feature teams and empowered product teams.  
In companies with the feature team model, those features are  
usuallycomingfromstakeholders,sothestakeholdersviewthemselves  
as “the client,” and they view the product teams as “the hired IT  
resource.”  
It’s another way of saying that the purpose of a feature team is to  
“serve the business.”  
Yet, in an empowered product team, the purpose of the product  
team is “to serve the customers in ways customers love, yet work for  
the business.”  
**98** Stakeholder Collaboration **99**  
So,inanempoweredproductteam,whilewestillcan’tignorethe  
business,itisaverydifferentrelationship.Ourjobistofindasolution  
that works for customers and for the various parts of the business.  
While it’s true that the majority of the actual collaboration for  
a product team is happening between the product manager, designer,  
andengineers,ahealthyrelationshipwithstakeholdersisbasedontrue  
collaboration as well.  
Theproductmanagerisnotthereto“gatherrequirements”from  
stakeholders,buttheproductmanagerisalsonottheretodictatesolu-  
tionstostakeholders.Rather,thestrongproductmanagerunderstands  
thateachstakeholderisresponsibleforsomekeyaspectofthebusiness,  
and they are a key partner in helping to come up with a solution that  
works.  
A common and clear example of this is that often what we are  
trying to do has legal implications, maybe around privacy or regula-  
tory compliance. The legal stakeholder is your partner in understand-  
ing these constraints and helping to evaluate the suitability of various  
approaches.  
Again,aconstructive,collaborativerelationshipwithstakeholders  
is predicated on the product manager having done her homework so  
shecanbethateffectivepartnerwiththestakeholder,andnotjustsome  
form of facilitator or project manager.  
Everything I said above is doubly important when we’re  
talking about collaborating with company executives. In general,  
the more senior in the organization, the more the executives care  
about everything—customers, brand, revenue, compliance—and  
the more important it is for the product manager to have done her  
homework.  
Collaboratingwithstakeholdersandexecutivesinvolveslistening  
carefullyto try to understandthe constraints, and thinking hard about  
solutions that would work for our customers and our business.  
Good product work is never easy, but it is much more enjoyable  
whenyouhaveastrong,collaborativerelationshipwithyourkeystake-  
holders.  
This begins by the manager coaching her product people on the  
role of each stakeholder, and why they are there, what they are con-  
cerned about and why, and what they need to succeed at their jobs. **100** EMPOWERED  
# Building the Foundation for Trust  
Modern product work is all about relationships. This is particularly  
true for product managers.  
Even if you leave out external parties like vendors, analysts,  
press, and customers, the list of internal people a PM must work  
with is still very large. It ranges from product team collaborators  
\(engineers, designers, data analysts, user researchers, other product  
managers, etc.\) to all manner of executives and stakeholders \(sales,  
marketing, legal, risk, founders, business leads, etc.\).  
In modern product organizations, a PM’s effectiveness depends  
onherabilitytoeffectivelynavigatearangeofpersonalities.Sheneeds

advancing her own.  
PMssometimesneedcoachingtorealizethattrustismosteasily

Try this exercise\: Have the PM write down the list of people

So how does she do this?

schedule a video call.

may consider having a regular chat, perhaps every one to two weeks. Stakeholder Collaboration **101**  
Thisshouldn’tincludeaworkagenda.Instead,sheshouldusethetime  
to build rapport and trust.  
Of course, this is much harder when the people she works with  
are in different cities or countries. In those cases, she can invest in  
trust by having extra time on calls dedicated to nonwork topics.  
With mutual trust, interactions go more smoothly. It’s easier  
to disagree professionally without either party taking it personally.

# Imposter Syndrome  
**I**have a bit of a contrarian opinion on imposter syndrome.  
First, I want to be clear that I’m not talking here about people  
who have a debilitating mental illness. I know people in this situation,  
and none would use the mild term “imposter syndrome” to describe  
the severe level of anxiety they deal with.  
That said, let me be clear that I believe imposter syndrome, as  
mostpeopleusethatterm,isaveryrealthing.Infact,Ithinkmostmen-  
tallyhealthypeople\(atleastthosethataren’tegomaniacs\)doubtthem-  
selves and can feel insecure about asserting their opinions on others.  
I \(Marty\) like to emphasize to the people I coach that this is a normal  
and healthy fear, and I share that I absolutely still feel the same way.  
Second, I think it’s important to acknowledge that imposters are  
alsoarealthing.Ifinditveryfrustrating,especiallyintheproductand  
designspaces,howmanypeopleonsocialmedia,authorsofarticlesand  
books, and conference speakers are, at least in my personal opinion,  
advocating nonsense.  
**102** Imposter Syndrome **103**  
I think imposter syndrome is a very healthy and necessary emo-  
tion,andanimportantsignalfromourminds.Butmostpeoplemisun-  
derstand that signal. They think it’s just natural fear and insecurities,  
everyone has them, and they need to simply overcome their worries  
and push past them.  
But I interpret this signal very differently. It is my mind warning  
me of the consequences if I don’t do my homework and truly prepare.  
Thefearoflookingcluelessiswhatkeepsmeuplatepreparing,study-  
ing, thinking, writing, rehearsing, and iterating.  
Most important, the fear of looking clueless is also what pushes  
me to try out my article/talk/presentationbeforehand on some people  
that I highly respect and I know will tell me honestly if I am not solid  
in my thinking or my delivery.  
ThereasonIknowthatmyworriesarenotunfoundedisbecause,  
morethanafewtimes,thosepeoplehaveindeedsavedmefrommyself.  
When I go to conferences, I too often hear speakers who, if they  
have imposter syndrome, clearly did not take the warning seriously.  
Shouldtheybepraisedforovercomingtheirstagefrightfearsand

To me that’s like giving a child a trophy just for showing up to  
the game.  
Moregenerally,Iseethisasyetanotherexampleofwhereweneed  
managersandleaderswhocareenoughabouttheirpeoplethattheyare  
willing to devote the time and energy to coaching them.  
Whenever I see some product person deliver an underwhelming  
presentation to an executive team or a conference, my frustration  
is centered not on the product person, but rather on that person’s  
manager.

Empowered product teams are predicated on trust—especially  
the product manager having earned the trust of the executives. When  
a product manager appears unprepared or naive in front of the  
executives, that trust is diminished, and it will take a long time to  
regain it.  
Moreover, this is why I tell managers and leaders of product that  
they are only as strong as their weakest employee.

# Customer-Centricity  
**I**n this chapter we’ll discuss how to help develop the critical trait of  
customer-centricity.  
If you ask a CEO or a product person if they care about their  
customers, you’ll usually get some sort of indignant “Of course I do!”  
response, sometimes followed with a defensive “Are you suggesting  
I don’t?”  
Pretty much everyone talks about how much they care about  
their customers. But when you actually get inside the company and  
you see how they handle a situation such as an outage, or when a  
product change causes customer confusion or frustration, or the  
infrequency that they actually sit down with real users and customers,  
it’s easyto see the differencebetween those who claimthey careabout  
their customers and those who demonstrate their care every day.  
This trait is very much related to company culture and is, of  
course, heavily influenced by the words and actions of the company’s  
leaders.  
I’llsayupfrontthatifyourleadersdon’tdemonstratethissincere  
careforyourcustomers,thenitwillbeveryhardtodevelopthisinyour  
**105** **106** EMPOWERED  
productpeopleoranyoneelse.IneachandeverycaseIknowofwhere  
the company truly cares about their customers, it’s clear that it comes  
from the very top.  
But assuming this is something that is central to your company’s  
corevaluesand not just lip service,then we need to talk about how we  
develop this trait in your product people.  
Clearly some people are more naturally empathetic than others,  
but in my experience people often tend to assume the worst about  
people they don’t know. The most common manifestation of this is  
the horde of product people who tend to think of their customers as  
not very bright.  
The first thing I like to emphasize is to be very specific and pro-  
tective over the term “customer.”  
It is an all-too-common problem where a product person thinks  
she has many different “customers.” In addition to the actual paying  
customers,sheviewseachstakeholderasacustomer,andsheviewsthe  
customer service team as her customer, and she views the CEO as one  
of her customers too.  
Iseethisasjusta remnantofthe oldroleoftechnologyto“serve  
thebusiness.”Butmoreimportant—andIpersonallyfeelverystrongly  
about this—besides confusing the relationship with stakeholders, this  
seriously dilutes the role of the truecustomer.  
So,Italkwiththeproductpersonaboutthevariousconstituencies  
involved with her product. Besides the users of our customer-facing  
products as our true customers, there may be internal users of our  
customer-enabling products, and there may be developers using plat-  
form services. All of these may be necessary to provide value and are  
therefore important, but none have the weight or importance of the  
true customers.  
I see the same problem in consumer-internet companies where  
there is a tendency to view our advertising partners as customers, but  
again they are not the customer, and it’s important to realize that. We  
work with our advertising partners to develop products for our true  
customers. If the true customer does not like the product, they won’t  
engage, so we fail, and our advertising partners fail as well.  
I prefer to keep the term “customer” almost sacred, and I believe  
this helps the product person understandthe role the customer neces-  
sarily plays in our actions and decisions. Customer-Centricity **107**  
I am a big fan of using storytelling to drive home what caring  
for customers really means in practice. A few of my favorites are the  
earlyFedExWeddingDressstory,1 theREIHikingBootReplacement  
story\(describedinthemovieWild\),2 andmanygreatstoriesfromearly  
Zappos, which you can read about in the book, DeliveringHappiness.  
3  
Ialsorecommendaminimumofthree,one-hourcustomerinter-  
actions each week, ongoing, and during the weekly 1\:1, I love to ask  
aboutthesecustomerinteractionsandseewhattheproductpersonhas  
learned. I also encourage the product person to share with me stories  
of what they experienced during these visits, and then to share these  
stories widely around the company. I explain that my purpose is to  
establish the reputation of this product person as someone who has  
a deep and personal knowledge of the company’s users and customers.  
The true test of customer-centricity is how the product person  
handles difficult or especially stressful decisions. When a customer is  
at a standstill \(often referred to as a “showstopper”\) because of some  
problemwithourproduct,howdoestheproductpersonrespond?Isit  
businessasusual?Oristheproductpersonensuringasenseofurgency  
\(not panic\) and leading by example to come up with an effective solu-  
tion?  
One of the behaviors I love in companies that are truly  
customer-centric is that leaders will usually proactively reach out to  
the product team and offer to help in any way they can. This sends  
a very clear message to the team as to their importance without  
resorting to micromanaging them.  
Be aware, however, that in companies that are truly customer-  
centric, if the product team is not prioritizing solving the customer  
problem as highly as the executives do, then the executives may lose  
confidenceintheproductteam,andtheywilloftenstepin.Theymight

# Integrity  
**T**his chapter and the next tackle two of the toughest, yet most cru-  
cial, aspects of successful product teams.  
In this chapter, I address integrity, and in the one that follows,  
we’llexploredecisionmaking.Thesetwotopicsaredistinct,butinter-  
related. I tackle integrity first because it is the foundation for good  
decision making in an empowered product team.  
Especially for product managers of empowered product teams,  
integrity is not some sort of lofty aspirational goal. As I explained  
earlier, empowered product teams are predicated on trust—with  
executives,stakeholders,customers,andyourownproductteam.Ialso  
explained how this trust is based on both competence and character.  
And integrity is at the heart of the necessary character.  
ThefirstthingIwanttoacknowledgeisthatdeveloping,demon-  
strating, and preserving your integrity is in no way easy.  
Forces are constantly conspiring to challenge your integrity.  
Just imagine you’ve just come out of a meeting with the CEO in  
whichshehasimpresseduponyoujusthowcriticallyimportantitisto  
**109** **110** EMPOWERED  
be able to deliver something urgently. Yet your team has explained to  
you how they absolutely need more time.  
Or you are sitting with a customer who is frustrated and angry  
because the product your team provided is not what they were led to  
believe they would receive.  
Oroneofyourstakeholdershasconfidedinyouthatshe’slooking  
atleavingthecompanybecauseshefeelsunabletodoherjobwiththe

ization.  
Oroneofyourbusinessdevelopmentpartnersisinvestingheavily  
in their side of your relationship, and you know that the product is  
unlikely to provide the value they are depending on.  
I could go on, but I’m guessing you can relate. Most product  
people have experienced these situations and have struggled to deter-  
mineacourseofactionthataddressestheimmediateissue,yetdoesn’t  
derailyourlonger-termeffortsandalsomanagestokeepyourintegrity  
intact.  
An experienced manager can coach a product person through  
thesemanytypesofsituationsandmakeallthedifferencetothecareer  
of a new product person\: identifying and avoiding the landmines,  
understandingtheprioritiesandthelargercontext,andnavigatingthe  
personalities.  
Aswithsomanytopics,tacklingthesechallengesisdifferentwhen  
coaching a product manager for an empowered product team versus a  
product manager for a feature team, which as I’ve discussed before, is  
much more of a project manager role.  
The feature team product/project manager role is still difficult,  
and integrity is still important, but in this case the product manager  
is fundamentally a messenger. She passes along requirements, con-  
straints, and dates to the product team, and passes back concerns,  
status, or bad news up to management.  
However,ifyou’recoachingaproductmanagerofanempowered  
product team, the expectations are much higher\: you’re expected  
to try and figure out a solution that works for the customer and  
works for your business. While that’s not always possible, you are  
expected to have the necessary knowledge and understanding of the  
business, and the ability to come up with creative solutions to tough  
problems. Integrity **111**  
I want to emphasize that what I’m about to share is what I’ve  
found has worked for me, and for many of the people I have coached.  
I am not arguing that this is the only path to integrity. In fact, I sus-  
pect there are differences based on the values of your company’s and  
your country’s culture. But if my list causes you to seriously consider  
whatisimportanttodemonstratingongoingintegrityinyourcompany,  
I would call that a useful outcome.  
WhenIcoachproductpeopleonintegrity,therearethreeessen-  
tial behaviors I focus on\: dependability, the company’s best interests,  
and accountability.  
# Dependability  
Integrity begins with impressing upon the product person how her  
word and her commitments need to be taken very seriously. You  
need to explain that if she misleads the executives, customers, or  
stakeholders—even withthe best of intentions—shemaypermanently  
damage her reputation in the company and prevent establishing the  
trust that is so essential to effective product teams.  
Attheheartofdemonstratingandpreservingintegrityisthecon-  
cept of a high-integrity commitment \(talked about in depth in Part VII\).  
First, if she gives her word on something—to a customer, stake-  
holder, executive,partner, or her own team—she needsto first be sure  
sheisbasinghercommitmentoninformedjudgment.Andsecond,she  
absolutely needs to do everything possible to then deliver on what she  
or her team has promised.  
Thismeansnotmakingacommitmentunlessanduntilherprod-  
uct team has had the opportunity to do sufficient product discovery  
to reasonably consider the risks of value, usability, feasibility, and via-  
bility. And just to be explicit, that means leaning on the expertise and  
experience of the designer and engineers.  
Moreover, with an empowered product team, it’s not sufficient  
just to ship something when promised. What you ship must actually  
work—itmustsolvetheproblemforthecustomerand/orthebusiness.  
This is much more difficult.  
Getting good at managing these high-integrity commitments is  
key to building a dependable reputation for her team. **112** EMPOWERED  
# The Company’s Best Interests  
The product manager needs to be perceived as always acting in the  
best interests of the company—not only protecting her or her team’s  
interests.  
Inlargercompanies,especiallythoseperceivedashighlypolitical,  
people are often suspected of having personal agendas or “fiefdoms.”  
But for a product team to be entrusted and empowered, it’s essential  
that the product team, and especially the product manager, be per-  
ceivedasnotonlyunderstandingtheoverallobjectiveofthecompany,  
but as sincerely committed to doing everything in her power to help  
the company succeed.  
\(Asanimportantsidenote,thisisamajorreasonwhyequity-based  
incentive and compensation plans are so effective—none of us wins  
unless the company wins.\)  
It’snotunusualforanewproductmanagertowonderhowshecan  
demonstrate this understanding of the company’s best interests when  
she’s the product manager of just a single team. But there are many  
opportunities\:helpingoutanotherproductteamononeoftheircritical  
objectives,goingaboveandbeyondforacustomerorastakeholder,or  
publicly giving credit to others. And most common of all, making or  
supporting a decision that is not necessarily optimal for her product  
team, but is clearly better for the customer or the business.  
Another difference between a feature team and an empowered  
product team is how engaged and committed the team is. It’s not hard  
forleadershiptotellifateamisengagedandpassionateaboutthemis-  
sionofthecompanyandtheirpartinmakingthathappen.Whileproject  
managers often resort to imposing deadlines, if you hope to have an  
empoweredteamofmissionaries,theproduct managerneedstoinstead  
share the overall purpose of the work.  
# Accountability  
Anempoweredproductteamsignsuptoachieveresults.Butwiththat  
empowerment necessarily comes the responsibility of accountability  
for those results. Integrity **113**  
Butwhatdoesaccountabilityreallymeaninpractice?Thankfully,  
it doesn’t usually mean that people get fired when results don’t  
materialize.

teammeansawillingnesstotakeresponsibilityformistakes.Evenwhen

You may have heard the old saying, “If a product team succeeds,  
it’s because everyone on the team did what they needed to do, but if a  
product team fails, it’s the product manager.”  
Some people think this saying is facetious, but not really.  
Considerthecasewheretheengineerstakemuchlongertodeliver

survive these mistakes if she is on the whole dependable in her com-  
mitments,alwaysworkstowardthecompany’sbestinterests,andtakes  
responsibility for her mistakes. **CHAPTER**

# Decisions  
**I**n the previous chapter, I discussed the importance of integrity and  
how it is the basis for decision making in an empowered product  
team.Inthischapter,I’dliketofocusonhowIcoachproductteamsin  
making good decisions.  
Rememberthatinfeatureteamsmostofthemeaningfuldecisions  
have been made upstream by executives and stakeholders. In contrast,  
anempoweredproductteamisallaboutpushingdecisionsdowntothe  
product team level.  
WhenIsay,“gooddecisions,”I’mnotjustreferringheretologic-  
al, data-informed business decisions. I mean decisions that the rest of  
your product team, your executives, your stakeholders, and your cus-  
tomers can support and understand, even if they disagree.  
You might wonder why we need to worry about all of these con-  
stituencies.Youmaythinkthatifit’stherightthingfortheproductand  
thecustomer,thenthiswillallworkoutintheend.Butthisignoresthe  
realitiesandcomplexitiesofpeopleandcompanies,especiallyifyou’re  
strivingforanempoweredteamofmissionaries ratherthanmercenaries.  
**114** Decisions **115**  
Whilemakingdecisionsiswhatempoweredproductteamsdolit-  
erally every day, how they make these decisions is often what separates  
the best from the rest.  
First, we need to keep in mind that good decisions rest on  
a foundation of integrity—you are perceived as being dependable  
in your commitments, you are believed to be acting in the best  
interests of the company, and you’re willing to be accountable to the  
results.  
Second, we need to constantly keep in mind the outcome we are  
striving for when we make a decision. We certainly want this to prove  
to be a successful decision—that is to say, one that is timely and con-  
tributes to a good outcome. But, beyond that, we want the leaders  
and stakeholders to understand and respect our rationale, even if they  
might have chosen differently. And we want the parties to feel gen-  
uinely heard and respected, even if the decision ended up not going  
their way.  
With these two points in mind, here are the five key behaviors  
that I coach product teams on when it comes to decision making.  
# Right-Size Decision Analysis  
It’s critical to acknowledge that not all decisions are equally important  
or consequential. We make decisions every day—ranging from select-  
ing what bugs to fix, to choosing the best approach to solving a hard  
problem.  
Iencouragetheproductteamtoconsiderthelevelofriskandthe  
associated level of consequence.  
Consequence means, if you make a mistake, how big of a deal is it?  
In many cases, we can recover from a mistake literally in a few hours.  
Inothercases,theconsequencemayverywellputtheproductoreven  
the company’s future at risk.  
Depending on the level of risk and consequence, you may feel  
there is critical information you absolutely need to collect before you  
can make a decision, and in other cases you may feel comfortable  
making the decision based on the imperfect information you have  
today. **116** EMPOWERED  
Consider also the people who will be impacted by this decision.  
Maybe there are revenue implications, or sales, or legal. If you  
need the support of other key people—executives or stakeholders or  
customers—thenyou’llneedtoelicittheirconcernsorconstraintsand  
also bring them along on the decision.  
Gooddecisions,especiallyinrisky,consequentialsituations,begin  
by creating a plan of attack. This is also where I spend a good deal of  
mycoachingtimebecauseheremyexperienceasamanagerandcoach  
can help the product team get started in the right direction.  
Asanexample,it’snormalforanoviceproductmanagertoeither  
seriouslyunderestimateoroverestimaterisk.Sheendsupspendingtoo  
much time in discovery on items that don’t really matter, and then  
doesn’t have time for the risks that do.  
# Collaboration-Based Decision Making  
Almost every product person I’ve ever coached has struggled with  
the question of what decisions she “owns” and what decisions others  
“own.” And I have to work hard to try to change this mindset.  
I’ve written earlier about how important it is to coach product  
teams on what we really mean by collaboration.  
In terms of specific decisions, I want the product manager to  
depend on, and usually defer to, the expertise and experience of her  
team—especiallyregardingdesign/usabilityandtechnology/feasibility.  
Gooddecisionmakingisnotaboutgettingeveryonetoagree\(the  
consensusmodel\),andit’snotaboutpleasingthemostpeople\(thevot-  
ing model\), and it’s also not about having one person who is expected  
to make all the decisions \(the benevolent dictator model\).  
Ifthedecisionisprimarilyaboutenablingtechnology,ifatallpos-  
sible, we defer to our tech lead. If the decision is primarily about the  
user or customer experience, if at all possible, we defer to our product  
designer. And if the decision is primarily about business viability, we  
will depend on the product manager collaborating with the relevant  
stakeholders.  
Thehardestdecisionsareusuallyaroundvalue,asvalueisafunc-  
tion of the whole. Decisions **117**  
# Resolving Disagreements  
Whilecollaboration-baseddecisionscovermostcases,wewillstillface  
situations where there is disagreement.  
For example, suppose your tech lead and your product designer  
disagree on the best approach to solving a problem. Or perhaps your  
CEO or another executive disagrees with your team.  
It’s important to realize that, in good organizations with strong,  
empowered product teams that genuinely care about their work and  
their customers, disagreementslike these arenormal and healthy. And  
especiallysinceweoftenhaveimperfectinformationtomakedecisions,  
opinion and judgment play a necessary role.  
Suppose, for example, the tech lead and the designer disagree on  
an approach because the tech lead considers the design unnecessarily  
difficulttoimplement,yetthedesignerconsidersthisdesignnecessary  
to the experience.  
Thisiswhereit’scriticallyimportantfortheproductteamtoknow  
when and how to run a test.  
This is another area where an experienced manager can coach  
the product team on the least expensive and most appropriate discov-  
ery technique forrunning this particulartest and collectingthe neces-  
sary data.  
Itusuallyinvolvesthecreationofaspecifictypeofprototype,and  
thenusingthisprototypetocollectevidenceor,ifwarranted,statistic-  
ally significant results or proof.  
Notethatifyoumakecollaboration-baseddecisions,andruntests  
for cases with disagreements, there will be very few situations of the  
product manager needing to override her team or escalate a decision  
up to senior management.  
# Transparency  
Keeping in mind our goal of bringing our team and our leaders along  
with us in understanding the rationale for our decisions, it’s important  
thatwebetransparentinmakingthem.Wedon’twantanyonetothink  
wearemakinguninformeddecisions,orignoringimportantconcerns,  
or pursuing our own agendas. **118** EMPOWERED  
Forminordecisions,itisoftensufficientjusttoexplainclearlyand  
simply in a note why a decision was made. For major decisions, I am  
a very big fan of the written narrative we discussed earlier. Especially  
with the FAQ section where each anticipated objection or concern is  
spelled out and addressed.  
This is yet another very good coaching opportunity, and I try to  
warn managers that many product people initially resist the rigors of  
a written narrative, but this is precisely what is warranted for conse-  
quential decisions.  
# Disagree and Commit  
As I said above, it’s important to acknowledge that in good organiza-  
tions with empowered teams, we will often disagree, and sometimes  
passionately—evenafterrunningatestandcollectingevidence.Please  
keepinmindthatthisisnotabadthing,andaclearsignofmissionaries.  
However,it’salsoimportanttoemphasizetotheteamthat,while  
disagreement and debate are necessary and good, at the end we may  
need to agree to disagree. Most people understand this, and as long as  
they genuinely feel like they were heard and their views considered,  
they are fine with this. But this is not enough.  
We need the team—especially the product manager—to go one  
step further and agree to commit to the decision that was made, even  
if they disagree with it.  
This can be hard for a new product manager to learn, especially  
because they are rightly concerned with their integrity.  
But imagine how toxic it is to the team if the product manager  
were to say to leadership, for example, that she deferred to her tech  
lead but doesn’t agree with the decision. Or suppose leadership makes  
asignificantdecisionthattheproductmanagerdoesn’tagreewith,and  
then she complains about that decision to her product team.  
Compare that to the situation where the product manager shares  
thevariousviewsandopinionsthatwereconsidered,andthenexplains  
thereasoningforthedecisionanddetailshowsheintendstomakethat  
decision successful.  
There is no need for her to hide what her personal opinion was,  
butshemustdemonstratethatsheunderstandsthevariousoptionsand Decisions **119**  
thereasonfortheeventualdecision,andthatshecanandwilldoevery-  
thing she can to make that decision successful.  
Decision making is a skill that will continue to develop over a

# Effective Meetings  
**I**need to confess up front that I have never been a fan of meetings.  
I know that my experiences sitting in countless poorly prepared,  
ineptlyrun,slowmoving,wastesoftimethatpreventedmefromdoing  
something I considered infinitely more important have permanently  
biased me against them.  
That said, I have also been in some meetings that were very dif-  
ferent. Where the organizer was prepared, and information was clear  
andlogical,asoliddecisionwasmade,andeveryoneintheroomatleast  
understood—eveniftheydidn’tpersonallyagree\(theall-importantdis-  
agree and commit\).  
Theresultisthat,whenIcoachpeople,I’mveryparticularabout  
how they run meetings, or even if they really need to hold a meeting.  
Meetings are a very easy way for other executives to form judgments  
aboutthepeopleontheproductteam,especiallytheproductmanager.  
An important caveat before we jump into this.  
I’m not talking here about meetings between members of the  
productteam,suchasastanduporretro,oranynumberofdailyinter-  
actions. If the product manager and product designer sit down over a  
**120** Effective Meetings **121**  
video call or in person to look at a prototype, while they are literally  
meeting, that’s just daily work and not the subject of this chapter. We  
are talking here about gatherings that go beyond the product team. It  
mayincludethestakeholdersortheexecutives,orpartners,ormembers  
of other teams.  
Thefirstthingtounderstandisthatthebiggestpainaboutmeet-  
ings is that they are synchronous. This means that every attendee needs  
to stop whatever they are doing, wherever they are, and meet—either  
in person or over a videoconference or the phone. That is rarely easy,  
or even welcome, so the meeting organizer needs to keep this in mind  
at all times.  
Ifthere’sawaytoservethepurposeasynchronously,thenthat’sgen-  
erally a better path. A status update or communicating information  
about a new release are great examples.  
Whilethereare,ofcourse,aninfinitenumberofpossiblereasons  
forameeting,inpractice,inproductorganizations,therearegenerally  
three types\: communication, decisions, and problem solving.  
# Communication

meanssuchasanemail.Anexamplemightbeanall-handsorasession  
where the leaders explain the product strategy.  
# Decisions  
The second type of meeting requires a decision, usually because it’s  
beyond what the product team can decide on its own. This is usually  
becausetheimpactreachesintootherpartsofthecompanyorthereis  
substantial risk.  
Inthiscase,Iamaverybigadvocateofthewrittennarrative.We  
startthemeetingwitheachmemberreadingthenarrative,andthenwe  
discuss and make an informed decision. **122** EMPOWERED  
# Problem Solving  
The third type of meeting is fundamentally for problem solving. We  
don’t know what the best course of action is \(otherwise we probably  
would have written that up in a narrative and presented it for a  
decision\). But we believe that, if we can get the right minds in the  
room, that together we may be able to solve an especially difficult  
problem.  
An example might be a postmortem after an outage, where we  
considerwhatwecoulddodifferentlygoingforwardtoavoidthistype  
of problem in the future.  
# Organizing Effective Meetings  
Here’s how I coach product teams on meetings.  
Purpose\: First, being very clear on the purpose of the meeting is  
an important start for the meeting organizer.  
Attendees\: Next, it’s important to decide on the attendees.  
Iencouragetheorganizertomaketwolists.Onelistwiththosepeople  
that are absolutely essential \(if they have a last-minute conflict would  
you need to postpone?\), and one list with those that are optional.  
Preparation\:Inallthreetypesofmeetings,preparationisessential.  
Ifit’sacommunication session,doyouhaveclarityonthecontent?  
Do you have the right medium to communicate this content? Neces-  
sary images or visuals?  
Ifit’sadecision meeting,doyouhavethewrittennarrative,andhas  
it been reviewed by someone who understands the space?  
If it’s a problem-solving session, how will you explain the situa-  
tion or context to the attendees? Have you already gathered the rel-  
evant data? Are you prepared to answer the various questions that will  
come up?  
Facilitation\: Assuming you’ve prepared, your job as the organizer  
is to facilitate an effective meeting. The nature of the facilitation will  
be different depending on the type of meeting. You are not there to  
police the meeting—you are there to ensure you get to the necessary  
decision or solution. Effective Meetings **123**  
Follow-up\: Once the meeting has reached a conclusion, there is  
usually some follow-up that needs to be done. This may involve noti-  
fying interested parties of the decision or next steps, but it’s important  
to close the loop.  
So,thebottomlineformeetingsis\(a\)makesurethatifyoucalla

and \(b\) prepare for the meeting to make sure it is efficient, effective,  
and accomplishes its purpose. **CHAPTER**  
# 23  
# Ethics  
**I**nthischapter,I’dliketodiscussoneofthemostsensitive,yetpoten-  
tially most important topics—the subject of ethics.  
As we’ve discussed, the four big risks that every product team  
needs to consider are\:  
1\. Will the customer buy it, or choose to use it? \(Value risk\)  
2\. Can the user figure out how to use it? \(Usability risk\)  
3\. Can we build it? \(Feasibility risk\)  
4\. Canthestakeholderssupportthissolution?\(Business viability risk\)  
Normally,wewouldconsiderethicalquestionsaspartofbusiness  
viability. If a solution is not ethical, it may indeed leave the company  
in serious trouble.  
In practice, however, there are two problems with this\:  
First, there are already so many different aspects to business  
viability—sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, privacy, and  
more—that it’s easy for ethics to get lost.  
**124** Ethics **125**  
Second,unliketheotherareasofbusinessviability,thereisrarely  
a stakeholder explicitly responsible for ethics.  
The result is that ethics too often does not get the attention it  
deserves,andwehaveallseenthedamagetothecompany,totheenvir-  
onment, to our customers, and to society, that can result from ethical  
lapses.  
So,Ihavebeenadvocatingforexplicitlyconsideringethicalimpli-  
cations by adding a fifth risk\:  
5\. Should we build it? \(Ethical risk\)  
One progressive tech-product company that does have a stake-  
holderspecificallyresponsibleforethicsisAirbnb,wheremylongtime  
friend Rob Chesnut served until recently as chief ethics officer \(he’s  
now an advisor for the company\).  
Robtrainedasalawyerandbeganhiscareerasafederalprosecu-  
tor, and then joined a young eBay as its legal counsel, which is where  
I \(Marty\) first met him. He has gone on to have a terrific career work-  
ing for and advising a range of leading tech companies, most recently  
at Airbnb.  
Rob has worked in the heart of Silicon Valley for decades and  
has seen what happens when companies don’t pay enough attention  
to ethics. Rob explains, “Leaders need to recognize that there’s a sea  
change in the world, where companies and their leaders are increas-  
ingly going to be held accountable for ethical failures.”  
There’s no question that tech is now big business and is subject  
to many of the same pressures that have long challenged large, public  
companies. Rob explains,  
In the past, companies had one stakeholder—the shareholder. Do what’s  
good for the bottom line. That’s an approach that has led a lot of compa-  
nies to think about everything in the short term, hitting the quarterly  
number. And it’s also incented a lot of behavior that is increasingly being  
recognized as unethical and causing more and more people to lose faith in  
companies. Hit the number, and don’t worry about whether what you’re  
building is really good for your customers, or the environment, or your  
partners, or the world at large. **126** EMPOWERED  
It’s important for companies to recognize other stakeholders and under-  
stand the implications that each product solution will have on those stake-  
holders. At Airbnb, for example, we not only consider the interests of  
our investors, but of other important stakeholders—our employees, our  
guests, our hosts, and the communities where we do business. If we consis-  
tently make decisions that negatively impact one or more of those stake-  
holders, we know that we’re failing in our mission and, over the long  
term, hurting our business.  
How does ethics apply to me in my job?  
Ethics applies to every member of the company, but it’s also true  
that product teams are on the leading edge where new products and  
services are conceived, developed, and deployed. So we have a special  
responsibility to consider the implications of our work.  
As Rob explains\:  
Good product teams need to understand the implications of the solutions  
they’re designing—not just on revenues, but on that broader stakeholder  
community. Signals to watch for\: Will the product solution be good for  
the end-customer? Does it have a negative impact on the environment  
in some way, or third parties in the community? Is it something that,  
if all of the emails and documents and discussions around the product  
were published online, you’d be embarrassed? How would government  
regulators react if they knew everything? Will the product be something  
that you will be proud of as part of your personal brand?  
Asleaderscoachtheirproductteams,thesearethetypesofques-  
tions we need to be discussing.More generally,it’s important for us to  
get this topic out on the table. “You want a company where everyone  
iscomfortableaskingtheuncomfortablequestions—thathelpsprotect  
your company against disastrous ethical failures.”  
So, what do you do if you identify an ethical issue?  
One of the toughest situations for a product person is when they  
spotabrewingethicalissue,butthey’renotsurehowtheyshouldhan-  
dle the situation. Clearly, this is going to be sensitive and potentially  
emotional.Ourbestansweristodiscoverasolutionthatdoesnothave Ethics **127**  
these ethical concerns, but in some cases, you won’t be able to or you  
may not have the time.  
Rob’s advice\:  
Speak up in a thoughtful way, raise your concerns, but not in a holier  
than thou nor accusatory way. Try to explain in a way that makes it  
clear that you care about protecting the best interests of the company.  
Ihavefoundthatit’sessentialtohaveadeepunderstandingofhow  
your business works so that you’re not perceived as naive or ignorant  
about the economics. This is also a situation where you may need the  
help of your manager.  
So, what do you do if you are working at a company that you  
believe is fundamentally not interested in ethics?  
Irarelyencouragepeopletoleavetheircompany;however,when  
itcomestothosecompaniesthatareclearlyignoringtheethicalimpli-  
cations of their work, I have and will continue to encourage people to  
leave.  
Rob’s response is\:  
If you’re not proud of where you work, not proud of how your company is  
impacting the world, or believe that leadership really doesn’t care about  
integrity, it’s probably time to start looking for another job.  
Fortunately,inmyexperience,thevastmajorityoftechcompanies  
do care about ethics and they are genuinely trying to help improve  
the world in some meaningful way. But even good intentions can have  
unintended consequences.  
As a product leader, it’s become increasingly important to coach  
your product people on this topic of ethics, starting with getting  
them to explicitly consider the question of whether we should build  
something.1  
1I strongly encourage you to read Rob Chesnut’s excellent book, Intentional Integrity\: How  
Smart Companies Can Lead an Ethical Revolution \(New York\: St. Martin’s Press, 2020\). **CHAPTER**  
# 24  
# Happiness  
**T**his chapter may seem an odd topic. You may be thinking that it’s  
not the manager’s job to be responsible for her team’s happiness.  
However, pretty much anyone that’s worked in tech for any  
amount of time knows that a manager can easily be responsible for a  
product person being miserable. That old saying about people joining  
a company but leaving a manager is unfortunately demonstrated  
every day.  
It’struethatIdon’tusuallyrefertothistopicas“coachinghappi-  
ness.” However, I do emphasize how important it is that the manager  
focus at least weekly on whether each of her product people feels she  
is doing meaningful work, progressing in her career, and building the  
necessary relationships with her team and with the execs that enable  
her to effectively and successfully lead an empowered product team.  
With the big caveat that everyone is different and what’s most  
importantisthatyouasmanagergettoknowyourpeoplewellenough  
thatyouunderstandwhatismeaningfultothem,andwhatmakesthem  
happy, I have found there are some near-universal truths to coaching  
happiness.  
**128** Happiness **129**  
# Meaningful Work  
Most people in the product world want their work to be meaningful.  
In fact, unless the manager is bad—in which case that  
dominates—in my experience this is usually the largest factor in  
happiness, even more than compensation.  
But it’s not always clear to the product person how or why  
her work is meaningful, or how her one small team contributes  
in a meaningful way. So, it’s important to very clearly and expli-  
citly discuss this and reinforce this frequently, both publicly and  
privately.  
# Personal Relationship  
I \(Marty\) will admit I have always wanted the people who work for  
me to like me. But I want them to like me for very specific reasons.  
I want them to believe that I am committed to helping them succeed  
professionally and personally. I want them to trust me so that I can be  
honestwiththemandgivethemthefeedbackthat’ssoessentialtotheir  
growth.Iwantthemtobeabletolookbackontheirtimeworkingwith  
me as among their favorite in their career.  
These professional relationships are built on personal relation-  
ships. I talk about my family and friends and interests outside of work  
and invite them to do the same. I have always made it a point to get to  
know them as people.  
I have always believedI can be a much better manager and coach  
if I know what their aspirations are and what motivates them.  
# Personal Recognition  
Lotsofpeopletellmetheydon’tneedrecognition,butIrarelybelieve  
them.WhatIbelievethey’retellingmeisthattheymightnotfeelcom-  
fortablewithcertainformsofpublic recognition.Butinmyexperience,  
pretty much everyone wants to feel valued. Especially by people they  
respect. **130** EMPOWERED  
Promotions, compensation, and equity are obvious ways to rec-  
ognize someone, but beyond that, I’m a big fan of more frequent and  
morepersonalformsofrecognition,especiallyonceI’vecometoknow  
their interests\:  
• A nice bottle of wine  
• A book I think she would enjoy  
• A ticket to an industry conference or event  
• A gift certificate for a nice local restaurant  
• A weekend getaway for two  
Most of the time, I’ve had sufficient budget to just cover these  
things, but there have been a couple of companies I’ve worked where  
I had to pay for them myself. But any good manager knows that they  
areonlyasgoodastheirpeople,sohelpingmypeoplefeelvaluedhelps  
me as well.  
# Work Habits  
It’s no secret in the product world that people sometimes work crazy  
hours. But it’s critical here to point out that, when people work long  
hours, there are two fundamental and very different reasons\: working  
long hours because you want to versus because you have to. This is a  
very different situation when it comes to coaching.  
Intoomanycompanies,peopleeitherfeelpressuredtoworkcrazy  
hours, or sometimes they are literally forced to. If this is the situation  
in your company, then you very likely have teams of mercenaries and  
not missionaries, and this entire topic of worrying about your people’s  
happiness is probably not something you care about.  
I’m talking about the other situation. Where you have truly  
empowered product teams, and the teams believe they are doing  
especially meaningful and important work. They sometimes get so  
wrapped up in that work that, by the time they look up from their  
computers, it’s late into the evening. Or, a year flies by and they have  
taken literally no vacation \(not so much a problem in much of the  
world, but a real issue in the United States and China especially\). Happiness **131**  
A good manager will notice this and discuss at the 1\:1. She will  
explain how easy it is to burn out, how important it is to play the long  
game, and how the job is essentially creative problem solving, which  
requirestimetorecharge.Ifthisisanongoingissue,thenit’sverylikely  
something that will need serious and active coaching.  
It’s also true that occasionally something really big and impor-  
tant will come up and the team will have a big push. So long as the  
motivation for this is coming from within the team, these situations  
may turn into people’s proudest achievements. It’s not always a  
bad thing.  
But again, the manager can help by making sure this isn’t  
the norm.  
# Modeling Good Behaviors  
There are many managers out there that work crazy hours yet try to  
tell their people they don’t need to. It’s the “do what I say not what  
I do” approach to management.  
But,ofcourse,manypeoplefeelpressuredtoworkatleastashard  
astheirmanager,whichofcoursecanleadtothissillyspiralofgetting  
in early, leaving late, and responding to emails at all hours.  
Again, if you truly care about the happiness of your people, you  
know your actions speak louder than your words.  
The manager needs to be sensitive to this, and in fact go out  
of her way to share how and when she’s personally recharging, being  
conscious about when she’s sending emails, and how she’s managing  
her time.  
# Career Planning  
It’salsoimportanttopointoutthatsometimes,inorderfortheproduct  
person to be truly happy in her life, it may mean helping her into a  
differentjob or even career.If the product personis not able to do the  
job,thenthismaybeuncomfortable,butit’sfairlystraightforward.But  
sometimes this isn’t the issue at all. **132** EMPOWERED  
One of the most personally difficult situations for me was when I  
\(Marty\) had an exceptionally strong product manager who was a close  
to ideal example of the type of person I try hard to recruit and coach.  
She was so smart and so savvy with people, and she learned so quickly,  
that I had little doubt she had a terrific career in front of her.  
But, eventually, she came to trust me enough to admit to me at  
one of our 1\:1s that, while she knew she was good at the job, and she  
feltshewasmakingarealimpact,shehadcometorealizethatthiswas  
not what she wanted with her life. It was hard for me, as I hated to  
lose such a talent, but I encouraged her to pursue her passion \(writing  
fiction\). She did, and was able to beat the odds and make it her career.  
More generally, I try to encourage managers to recognize and  
acknowledge just how important a role they play in the lives of their  
employees.Theyhavethepowertomakeanemployee’slifemiserable,  
or to help them achieve their professional and personal goals.  
# The Greatest Coach  
Youmayhavebeensurprisedintheintroductiontothisbooktolearn  
that during the early, formative years of their respective companies,  
Steve Jobs of Apple, Larry and Sergey of Google, and Jeff Bezos of  
Amazon were all coached by the same person\: Bill Campbell, known  
as “The Coach of Silicon Valley.”  
Most people outside of Silicon Valley aren’t aware of this, and  
that’s largely because Bill did everything he could to avoid being in  
the limelight. He wanted the attention to be on the people he was  
coaching.  
In fact, I tried to write about him back in 2007, but he asked  
me not to publish because he didn’t want the attention. It turns out I  
wasn’t the only one he turned down.  
Tobeclear,Iwasneverfortunateenoughtobeoneofthepeople  
he coached. I truly wish I was. But I met him several times because  
I was lucky enough to work for people he did coach.  
Bill passed away a few years ago, and I’m still learning of  
others he coached. Just recently, two of the people he coached—Eric  
Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, and Jonathan Rosenberg, the Happiness **133**  
former SVP Product of Google—interviewed many of the other  
people Bill coached, and put together a book of his leadership and  
coaching principles called Trillion Dollar Coach.  
1  
It’s always hard for me to describe Bill because his personality  
was such a big part of the impact he made. But I think this book does  
a good job.  
I’ve shared some of his quotes throughout this book.  
I would argue that even though Apple, Amazon, and Google  
have very different cultures, they all understand the essential role of  
product, and they all understand that empowering product teams to  
do great work is the key.  
While I loved reading the book on Bill Campbell, it was also  
personally humbling for me. I’ve been doing product for so long, it’s  
hardformetorememberwhatthingsIlearnedfromothersandwhat  
thingsIfiguredoutformyself.ButhearingsomanyofthepointsIfeel  
most strongly about emphasized in this book, it made me realize that  
I owe much more to Bill Campbell than I knew. It’s clear to me now  
that these points were drilled into me by those he coached, who then  
went on to coach me. But I think that fact would make The Coach  
especially happy.  
One last point from Trillion Dollar Coach that really resonated  
with me personally\:  
Bill would say that he had a different way of measuring his impact, his  
own kind of yardstick. I look at all the people who’ve worked for me or  
who I’ve helped in some way, he would say, and I count up how many  
are great leaders now. That’s how I measure success.  
I’m often asked why I’m still coaching product people after so

# Path to Leadership  
I first met Lisa in 2010 when she was the  
VP Engineering at Ask.com.  
LisastudiedcomputerscienceatUC  
Santa Barbara, and began a long career in  
technology, initially as an engineer at HP,  
but soon she joined a young ask.com \(do

Over the next 12 years, Lisa earned  
her way through the engineering ranks to eventually becoming the

**134** Leader Profile\: *Lisa Kavanaugh* **135**  
What has always defined Lisa, however, was her passion for  
coaching, and for continuously improving both herself and those who  
worked for her.  
Forthepastseveralyears,shehasdedicatedhercareertocoaching

nies need them to be.  
# Leadership in Action  
I asked Lisa how she generally goes about helping technology leaders  
to become skilled leaders of empowered teams and organizations.  
Here’s Lisa in her own words\:  
Differentleadershavedifferentmotivationsforseekingcoaching.  
Some desire a major promotion, some are facing an obstacle standing  
inthewayoftheirgoals,andotherswanttoestablishabetterworking  
relationship with their team or peers. They all desire an outcome that  
feels out of reach.  
Whateverthecase,transformingtoastrong,confident,inspiring  
leader can take effort and personal courage.  
These are four key skills that each leader needs to complete that  
transformation.  
# Self-Awareness  
It begins with being honest with yourself and understanding what  
behaviorsortraitsmightbegettinginyourownway,orinyourteam’s  
way. Ask yourself, what are the behaviors that may have served you  
well earlier in your career, but now are no longer advantages?  
Here’s a remarkably common example of that. I often meet tech-  
nologyexecutivesthathavebuiltareputationforabsolutelydependable  
execution. They have consistently put in the effort and delivered what  
theyhadpromised.Inmanycases,theyhavehadtomovemountainsto **136** EMPOWERED  
deliver, but they did. They are known for their reliable execution and  
that is a large part of their identity.  
But now the leader has been promoted to the level where her  
personaleffortcan’tscale,andherteamsfeelliketheyarebeingmicro-  
managed. The self-awareness that is needed here is to realize that the  
skills that got her to this level won’t get her to the next level.  
# Courage  
When you have built a career and identity out of one set of behaviors  
andyourealizeyouneedtochange,especiallyinwaysthatnowdepend  
on other people, this can take real courage.  
It takes courage to make space for teams to learn and make mis-

Courageous leadership is going forward despite the discomfort.  
# Rules of Engagement  
Formanyleaders,learningtotrusttheirteamscantakeaverybigleap  
of faith. Especially because they know they are still ultimately respon-  
sible for successful outcomes. Leader Profile\: *Lisa Kavanaugh* **137**  
Rules of engagement are simply an agreement with the teams on  
what type of visibility the leader needs in order to give the teams the  
space they need to work. What information does the leader need in  
order to trust? What context does the team need to understand to be  
successful?What does the team need to feel safein surfacingrisksand  
problems early or asking for help?  
It’simportanttoemphasizethattheserulesofengagementtypic-  
ally evolve as the trust and learning is built over time, but establishing  
some agreement around what information to communicate when, can  
help both the leader and the teams to work out effective ways for each  
party to get their needs met.  
# Disrupting Yourself  
Even if the leader is self-aware, has the personal courage to make the  
necessarychanges,andhasagreedtorulesofengagement,it’snosecret  
that long-held habits can be very hard to break. Especially habits and  
behaviors that get to the very core of someone’s identity and feelings  
of self-worth.  
Effectively, we’re asking the leader to disrupt herself. We’re  
asking her to commit to change. We acknowledge that there will be  
mistakes and regressions, but each time that happens we’ll identify  
the triggers and look at better ways to respond. We acknowledge that  
the first days and weeks will be the most difficult. But every day that  
goesby,theleaderwillbeabletoaccessthenewbehaviorsmoreeasily.  
Everyleader’sjourneyisdifferent,butIhavefoundovertheyears  
that if a leader truly wants to improve, and has the courage to take the  
leap of faith necessary to learn to trust others, that they can indeed  
disrupt themselves and become the leader their company needs, and  
that their employees deserve. **PART**

# Staffing  
**I**n the next series of chapters, I focus on the manager’s staffing  
responsibilities.  
I’ve made a big deal in the chapters so far about how important  
it is to coach and develop your people, but I have not talked yet about  
how to findthese people.  
Of course, much has already been written about staffing and hir-  
ing by many others.1  
WhatI’llbefocusingoninthesechaptersiswhatisspecialabout  
staffingwhenitcomestoempoweredproductteams—especiallyprod-  
uct managers, product designers, and senior engineers/tech leads.  
I’ll start with recruiting, and then cover interviewing, hir-  
ing, onboarding, annual performance reviews, terminations, and  
promotions.  
This might not seem like such an important or interesting topic  
to you—I know early on in my own product leadership career it was  
not—but I hope to change your mind about this, as it’s one of the

**139** **140** EMPOWERED  
clear and essential differences between strong product companies and  
the rest.  
There are three higher-order problems I see in companies when  
it comes to staffing\:  
The first is that there is often very fundamental confusion about  
what to look for when hiring strong product people. Too often the  
company thinks that, if they want to compete with the likes of Google  
andAmazon,theyneedtohireexceptionalpeople.Thisisadangerous  
misconception.  
Letmebeclearonthis\:thebestproductcompanieshirecompetentpeople  
ofcharacter,andthencoachanddevelopthemintomembersofextraordinary  
teams.  
This is why staffing and coaching go hand in hand.  
Thesecondisthat,infartoomanycompanies,theleadersequate  
staffing with hiring. But it’s a much larger problem than just hiring,  
and in fact, if you focus just on hiring, you will dramatically reduce  
your chances of building the organization you need.  
Thethirdhigher-orderpointistorealizethatstaffingistherespon-  
sibilityofthehiringmanager.  
Far too often, I find that the hiring manager believes this is the  
responsibility of HR, and that while she might review some resumes,  
and participate on the interview team, she thinks of herself as just a  
passenger on the journey and not the driver.  
While HR can hopefully assist with some of the supporting and  
administrative tasks \(such as posting job descriptions, passing along  
resumes,andpreparingofferletters\),effectivestaffingbeginswithreal-  
izing that a successful outcome requires that thehiringmanagerstepup  
andtakeresponsibilityforthis.  
Ifnothingelse,Ihopethisseriesofchaptersmakesclearwhythis  
is the case.  
More generally though, staffing is another one of the areas  
where strong product companies are dramatically better than most  
companies.

—JeffBezos Staffing **141**  
Andthisisinnosmallpartadirectresultofthestrongcompany’s  
reliance on the empowered team model. This is because the empow-  
ered team model is truly a people-first model. You are hiring capable  
people and giving them the space to do remarkable things.  
Forcompaniesstillinthefeatureteammodel,thepeoplearemer-  
cenaries.Theybelievetheycanalwayshireothers,orthey mighteven  
hire an agency and outsource the work.  
But for those companies committed to the empowered team  
model, everything depends on hiring competent people who share  
your values and are passionate about pursuing your product vision.  
And that means that staffing must move from a necessary task to a  
strategic skill.  
Most people coming from a feature team-style company are sur-  
prised to see the differences in terms of recruiting, the seriousness of  
the interview process, how much time they devote to new employee  
onboarding, and most important, the ongoing effort in coaching and  
developing their people to reach their potential.  
I am not suggesting that there is only one good way to handle  
staffing, but I am suggesting that these activities deserve much more  
attention than most companies and hiring managers devote to it.  
I’ll go further and suggest that skill in staffing is one of the most  
important and telling leading indicators for a company’s success. **CHAPTER**

# Competence and  
# Character  
**W**henItalktoexecutivesandmanagersthatdon’ttrustthepeople  
on their product teams, I find that they often have very anti-  
quated,andIbelieveharmful,viewsonwhattypesofpeopletorecruit  
and hire.  
So I ask these leaders to consider a very different approach to  
staffing.  
First, when I say that strong product teams are composed of “or-  
dinary people,” I’m not suggesting that you can hire anyone off the  
street and turn them into members of extraordinary teams. They do  
need to have the necessary skills to succeed.  
However, I am suggesting that rather than obsessing over  
the university the person attended, or the ambiguous concept of  
“cultural-fit,” or whether the person is a so-called 10X performer,  
**142** Competence and Character **143**  
or thinking you need to hire people with a deep knowledge of your  
domain, focus instead on what I’m about to describe.  
To be clear, there is most definitely such a thing as a 10X  
employee. These are people who have demonstrated their ability to  
contribute on the order of 10X more than their peers.  
However, it’s also no secret that having a 10X employee does not  
necessarily translate into having 10X results. That’s because results in  
product companies come from product teams, and in fact if that 10X  
employee brings along toxic behaviors, they will likely cause far more  
damage to your organization than good.  
Let’s discuss the characteristics you should consider when  
recruiting and assembling strong, cross-functional, empowered  
product teams.  
# Competence  
Stephen Covey explained that\:  
Trust is a function of two things\: competence and character. Competence  
includes your capabilities, your skills, and your track record. Character  
includes your integrity, your motive, and your intent with people. Both  
are vital.

You’veprobablyheardtheoldadagethat“A’shireA’s,butB’shire  
C’s.”Amanagerthatisnotanaccomplishedproductmanager,designer,  
or engineer herself is ill-equipped to assess a candidate, and it is easy  
to see how the company can end up hiring someone that is not com-  
petent at the job. Moreover, without the necessary experience herself, **144** EMPOWERED  
the hiring manager is not able to coach and develop that person to  
competence.1  
Normally, we hire for competence; however, there’s nothing  
wrong with hiring based on potential—but if and only if the hiring  
manager is willing and able to sign up to actively coach that person to  
competence.Andiftheyfailinthat,tofindthatpersonadifferentjob.  
That’s a big commitment of time and effort on the hiring manager.  
Staffing is one of the three key responsibilities of management,  
but to be clear, it’s absolutely critical to ensure competence. Without  
competence, the person and the team cannot expect to be trusted by  
management or leadership. So there is no lasting empowerment with-  
out competence.  
# Character  
Once we know the candidate has the required level of competence,  
most companies focus on what is usually referred to as “cultural fit.”  
This is probably one of the most damaging concepts for your  
efforts to build a great organization.  
Of the vast pool of people in the world, companies filter out  
almosteveryoneexceptthosewhoareperceivedasaculturalfit,which  
of course is a very ill-defined concept.  
For too many organizations, cultural fit is the politically correct  
term for what essentially translates into\: “Hire people who look and  
think like we do.”  
In our industry, that usually means hiring males with technical  
degreesfromtop-tieruniversities.Inmyexperience,thisisnotusually  
conscious or intentional, but the results are plain to see.  
I’dliketotrytoconvinceyouthatculturalfitisthewrongobjec-  
tive here.  
Mostpeopledon’tknowthatthemostsuccessfulsportsfranchise

you with the product leadership coaching you need. Competence and Character **145**

players and coaches for their team\: the “No Assholes Rule.”2  
They understand that it doesn’t matter how exceptionally skilled  
aplayerorcoachmaybe,ifhe’sanasshole,thenhewillbetoxictothe  
team overall.  
So rather than narrowing a very large pool of people to the small  
subset that are perceived as a cultural fit, I argue to instead keep the  
pool very large and just filter out the relatively few assholes.  
The irony is that we know that competence and character are  
all-important to establishing the necessary trust, yet so many com-  
panies and managers hire either people who are cultural fits but not  
competent, or they justify hiring an asshole because they believe the  
person is exceptionally skilled.  
One of the unintended and damaging consequences of hiring  
people like us is that they too often think like us.  
It’s not that the way we think is bad, it’s that what we really need

So, rather than looking for people like yourselves, make it an  
explicit point to look for people that are clearly not like yourselves.  
People who come from different environments. People who were  
educated differently. People with different types of work experience.  
People with different life experiences.

# Recruiting  
**M**ostpeoplethinkthatstaffingbeginswithsourcing,butasyou’ll  
see, in strong product companies staffing begins with active  
recruiting.  
In an HR-driven approach to hiring, a hiring manager might  
provide a job description, but things don’t really get going until HR  
startsprovidingresumes\(knownassourcing\).Infact,oneoftheobvious  
symptoms of this problem is when the hiring manager complains that  
she’s not getting enough high-quality resumes.  
Yet for strong managers, it’s the opposite. The hiring manager  
identifies what she wants, and then she goes out and recruits.  
It’s analogous to a college or professional sports team. While  
a coach might get an occasional “walk-on” \(the rough equivalent of  
someone sending in their resume\), mostly the coach actively works  
to recruit the necessary talent\: visiting prospects, getting to know  
them personally, and working to persuade the desired talent to join  
their team.  
It’s worth pointing out that recruiting rather than sourcing is the  
fastest way I know to improve diversity. Especially when the hiring  
manager understands that innovation thrives in a team where each  
**146** Recruiting **147**  
person thinks differently. We generally don’t want or need more of the  
same. We need people with different educations, different approaches  
to problem solving, different life experiences, and different strengths.  
The truly strong manager knows that, through recruiting, she is  
crafting product teams, and not just a collection of people.  
So, where do you find these people?  
Building your network of potential recruits is an ongoing  
activity—not something you start doing once you have an opening.  
You meet people at industry conferences and professional meetups, at  
competitors,duringvisitstopartnersandcustomers,viaintroductions  
from referrals, and even socially.

recognized as exceptionally smart and always find a way to get things

I always encourage hiring managers to cast a wide net when  
looking for exceptional product talent. I’ve found them in engin-  
eering, finance, marketing, sales, legal, and in a business owner or  
stakeholder role.  
You need to be sensitive to the rest of the organization here as  
you’re not trying to poach people, but rather, you’re trying to make  
sure everyone is in the best position to utilize their talents.  
Youalsoneedpatiencewhendevelopingthisnetworkofpotential

years—gettingtoknowthemandtheircareergoalsandplantingseeds

As an example, when recruiting product managers, I seek out  
entrepreneurial people. Many of the type I’m looking for aspire to  
start their own company one day. So I explain to them that product  
management is considered the proving ground for a startup founder  
or CEO, and I explain why that’s the case.

# Making Recruiting a Priority  
I \(Chris\) experienced the power of real coaching in my first job as a  
product manager at a startup. My job was predominantly as an indi-  
vidual contributor,withtheexpectationthatIwould eventuallybuild  
out the product management team. The company was growing fast,  
andmyproductwasgainingmomentumandcustomers.Iwasimpos-  
siblybusy,andIwasfinallygiventheapprovaltohireanotherproduct  
manager to help me out.  
The demands on me as an individual contributor hadn’t  
changed, so I relied heavily on our small HR team to drive the  
process. I would check in with them once or twice a week, review  
resumes,andconductphonescreens,butwasotherwisequitepassive.  
I had so much other work, and besides, this was what the HR  
department was there for, right? Recruiting **149**  
Duringthistime,Ihadregular1\:1swithmymanager.Heasked  
me about how the recruiting was going and I filled him in on the  
promising resumes and phone screens. I would quickly pivot to dis-  
cussing the product and the business, and without irony, how com-  
pletely underwater I was.  
After two weeks, I still hadn’t found any candidates worthy of  
bringinginforaninterview,andinour1\:1,mymanagerrefusedtolet  
me move to a new topic. He told me with no uncertainty that hiring  
anewproductmanagerwasmysinglemostimportanttaskrightnow.  
Thiswasmydayjob,notalltheotherthingsthatwereconsumingmy  
time. To underscore the importance, he said that until that role was  
filled, I should expect to spend a minimum of 50 percent of my time  
on that task. Everything else was secondary.  
This was a complete shock to me. I wasn’t able to get my cur-  
rent tasks done, so how could I possibly free up that much time? We  
proceededtogothrougheverythingIwasworkingonandtogetherdis-  
cussedwhatcouldbetemporarilydeprioritized,whatcouldbeshifted

Afterwehadcreatedspaceforthehiringwork,Iwashitwithmy  
next realization\: I had no idea how to even spend that much time on  
hiring. My manager then led me through a process where we brain-  
stormed strategies for me to tap and develop my personal network,  
actively scour resources for candidates, reframe the job description,  
andgenerallyhowtoplayamuchmoreactiveroleindrivingrecruit-  
ing rather than slotting into an HR-sourcing process.  
This single 1\:1 was one of the most memorable in my career.  
It profoundly expanded my view of my job, it built a new level  
of trust with my manager, it shined a bright light on where I needed  
to grow, and it gave me a glimpse of what real leadership looked like.  
I was newly inspired and plunged into the hiring task.

# Outsourcing  
Seriously? I certainly hope that anyone who has read this far already  
knows what I’m about to say about the prospect of outsourcing.  
Butfirstsomecaveats.I’mspeakinghereaboutoutsourcingasit  
pertainstothecorerolesinatechproductorganization\:productman-  
agers, product designers, engineers, data analysts and data scientists,  
user researchers, and the managers of these people.  
Yourproductsarethelifebloodofyourcompany,andtheseskills  
must be core competencies.  
Your customers depend on these products and services.  
Outsourcing these things will almost certainly kill any chance  
youhaveofteamsofmissionaries.Justtheopposite,youliterallyhave  
created teams of mercenaries.  
Youmightsaythatyoudon’thavepeopleonstaffwiththeneces-  
sary skills. Then either hire these people or invest in your existing  
staff to learn and develop those skills—primarily through coaching  
and training.  
You might say that you think you’ll save money by hiring some  
low-cost, offshore firm. I promise you that you will end up spending  
much more and getting much less for it. The amount of overhead  
in terms of time and communication—and even more important, the  
opportunitycostoflosingyourabilitytoinnovate—makesthisavery  
poor investment.  
Occasionally, we have some large burst of work such as test  
automation or a large migration and using an outsourcing firm for  
this is not going to be a problem.  
Just remember that a smaller group of missionaries will always  
outperform a larger group of mercenaries, especially if you consider  
the need for both discovery and delivery. **CHAPTER**  
# 28  
# Interviewing  
**T**o continue with our series on staffing, in this chapter I discuss the  
interview process.  
As with recruiting, the hiring manager needs to take responsibil-  
ity for the interview effectiveness of the interview team, and the interview  
experience for the candidate.  
The hiring manager may have some administrative help and/or  
someHRhelp,butthehiringmanagerneedstoownandactivelyman-  
age this process.  
Your overarching goal is to ensure you hire competent people of  
character, and that every hire—at least for product managers, product  
designers, and tech leads—should raise the average.  
Note that since we have more than one engineer on a product  
team, it is not a problem to have a range of experience and capability  
levels in our engineers. However, for product managers, product  
designers, and tech leads—since there is just one each per team—it’s  
critical to ensure a high standard of competence. Those are not  
“junior” roles.  
**151** **152** EMPOWERED  
ThemostcommonproblemIseeisindeterminingtheinterview  
team. Too often the primary concern is to be inclusive, and make sure  
everyone who wants to has a say. But this approach will rarely raise  
the bar, and often leads to a consistent, gradual decline in the average  
capability level.  
So instead, the hiring manager should very carefully select and  
curatetheinterviewteam.Eachpersonshouldbeselectedbothforher  
competenceandforhercharacter.Theseshouldbepeoplethatastrong  
candidatewouldbeproudtoworkwithandwouldalsoenjoygettinga  
beer with.  
Ensurethateveryteammemberunderstandsspecificallywhatshe  
will be interviewing for—the skills and experience will depend on the  
specific role you’re hiring for—and make sure she has prepared.  
Most larger companies have interview guidelines that speak to  
appropriateandinappropriatequestions,butrarelyprovideanymean-  
ingful guidance on the interview content itself.  
Yourobjectiveduringtheseriesofinterviewsistoensurethatany  
open questions are resolved by the end of the interview day. This is  
normally done by each interviewer communicating to the next inter-  
vieweranyopenquestionssothatthenextinterviewercaninvestigate.  
Andthehiringmanager,orwhoeveristhelastinterview,shouldextend  
the time as necessary to resolve any open questions.  
Likewise, if the hiring manager receives feedbackfrom the inter-  
viewers during the day that indicate that this candidate is clearly not a  
fit, then it is fine to end the day earlier.  
Three points are worth special mention\:  
First, there is a difference between hiring for competence and  
hiring for potential. Normally we are looking for people who have  
demonstrated the competence to perform the necessary role.1  
However, in some cases, we will hire based on potential—  
someone that has not yet shown she can succeed at the job, but we are  
willing to make a bet on her. A university hire would be a common  
example.Inthecaseofhiringbasedonpotential,itisessentialthatthe

alsothatthehiringmanagerpersonallycommittoinvestthenecessary

SmartandRandyStreet’sWho\: The A Method for Hiring \(NewYork\:BallantineBooks,2008\). Interviewing **153**  
This typically involves not just the normal weekly 1\:1 but also  
daily coaching—often for a period of months. And, moreover, if the  
personisnotabletoreachcompetenceinareasonableamountoftime,  
thehiringmanagerneedstotakeresponsibilityforcorrectingthathir-

Second, always remind the interview team that we are not look-  
ing for more of the same. Innovation thrives with people who think  
differently.So,candidateswithdifferenteducation,differentlifeexperi-  
ences,differentcultures,ordifferentapproachestoproblemsolvingare

Third,manyhiringmanagersmakethemistakeofhiringprimar-  
ily for domain knowledge, but for most positions—if you are hiring  
the right person with the right skills—she will be able to learn the  
domain much faster than someone with the necessary domain knowl-  
edge can learn the necessary product skills. In fact, in many cases, too  
much domain knowledge is more of a liability \(they make the mistake  
of thinking they are the customer\).  
# My Favorite Interview Question  
The question comes late in the interview. The setup goes like this.  
Now that I know you a bit, I’d like to give you a list of four broad  
work attributes. You’re a product person, so I already expect that you’re  
strong in each. But I highly doubt that you consider yourself equally  
competent in all of them. So, I’m going to ask you to stack rank them  
in order of strongest to weakest.  
Thissetupshouldbedisarming.Thecandidatemustunderstand  
that there is no correct answer to the question, hopefully setting up  
an honest conversation.  
Nowforthefourattributes,innoparticularorder.I\(Chris\)usu-  
ally describe them this way\:  
1\. Execution—how well do you get things done, do the right thing  
without being asked, and track lots of simultaneous targets?  
\(continued\) **154** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
2\. Creativity—how often are you the person in the room with the  
most or the best ideas?  
3\. Strategy—howwelldoyougetupabovewhatyou’reworkingon  
and put it into a broader market or vision context and then make  
this clear to others?  
4\. Growth—how good are you at figuring out ways to multiply  
effort through smart use of process, team management, and  
so on?  
The surface value of this question reveals how a candidate  
engages in a conversation that is ultimately about their self-assessed  
weaknesses.  
I put a lot of importance on a product person’s level of  
self-awareness and her ability to identify and admit areas of growth.  
\(You can think about this question as a less contrived and more  
effective version of the old “tell me about your weaknesses.”\)  
I’mskepticalofacandidatewhoisunwillingorunabletoventure  
into this conversation, or when her self-assessment seems wildly at  
odds with what I’ve already observed in other parts of the interview.  
If you’re the hiring manager, this question serves another pur-  
pose\: it is a check on your own biases, and it helps ensure that you  
don’t end up hiring a bunch of clones \(usually of yourself\). **CHAPTER**  
# 29  
# Hiring  
**A**fter interviewing, hopefully you have found a candidate you  
believewillbeastrongadditiontotheorganization.Youneedto  
prepare an offer and close the candidate.  
Much of the hiring process will be dictated by HR compliance  
and compensation, but there are some essential points for the hiring  
manager.  
First, if you have found a truly strong candidate, then it’s critical  
to move quickly. Strive to produce an offer in 24–48 hours. Beyond  
that, you may lose a good candidate. And even if not, it demonstrates  
to the candidate that the company has a hard time making decisions,  
which is not a good look.  
Second,takereferencechecksseriously,anddothempersonally—  
don’t delegate this to anyone else. Be sure to ask if the person would hire  
the candidate again.  
One of the most important goals of a reference check is to  
try to identify candidates that are going to prove toxic due to their  
**155** **156** EMPOWERED  
personality. Most such people can hide the problematic parts of their

Butgobeyondareferencecheck.Oneofthesurestwaystodayto  
spot toxic personalities is to explore the candidate’s behavior on social

Dotheyhavethoughtful,respectfulinteractionsordotheyassumethe

If the candidate is consistently rude in public on social media, it  
is very likely they will eventually act the same at work.  
The official offer may come from HR or from the hiring  
manager, but in either case, what is most important is that the hiring  
manager call the candidate, and explicitly tell the candidate that if  
she joins and commits to putting in the effort, then you will promise  
to personally invest in coaching and developing the candidate to reach her  
potential.  
If the candidate is especially good, it’s very possible that she will  
receive multiple offers, and this is when I would typically request that  
the CEO or other key leader reach out and offer to talk. This sends a  
very valuable message to the candidate and can also help get the rela-  
tionship off to a good start.

# Span of Control  
Span of control refers to how many direct reports a manager has.  
Many companies have standard ranges, but if a company is to  
make a serious investment in coaching and product strategy, this will  
impact the number of reports a given manager is responsible for.  
Every people manager’s first responsibility is to coach and  
develop her people; however, depending on the type of people being  
managed, the amount of time required for that coaching can vary  
substantially.  
Here are the primary factors to consider.  
# Level of Operational Responsibility  
If your role carries significant operational responsibilities, such as  
product strategy, design strategy, and architecture/tech debt strategy,  
that will consume real time.  
# Level of Experience of Employees  
Many companies have little choice but to hire people that are inex-  
perienced in their new roles and to coach them to success. There is  
oftensuchfiercecompetitionfortalentthatcompanieseitherhaveto  
payextraordinarysalariesorhirebasedmoreonpotentialthanproven  
performance.  
This can work quite well, but with two very important caveats.  
First,thehiringmanagermustbeskilledatcoaching,andwillingand  
able to provide the necessary time and effort. Second, it requires a  
smaller span of control—for example, the manager might have four  
to five direct reports rather than six to eight.  
# Level of Experience of Manager  
Similarly,theexperienceofthemanagerplaysasignificantroleinthe  
appropriate span of control. Just as with any skill, coaching skills can  
\(continued\) **158** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
be developed, and an experienced manager who takes pride in her  
coaching gets substantially more efficient and effective in developing  
her staff.  
# Organizational Complexity  
Finally, and this is often counterintuitive, in larger organizations the  
amount of “connecting the dots” and “managing up and across the  
organization” goes up considerably.  
Someofthatissimplyafunctionofthenumberofdependencies,  
interactions, and resulting communication, but some is a function of  
the interpersonal dynamics \(aka politics\) of large organizations.  
# Ratios  
So, how many people should report to you as a manager?  
The smallest span of control \(within the broader tech prod-  
uct organization\) is typically a group product manager, which is a  
player-coach role where the GPM is responsible for at most two or  
three other people.

**N**ormally, the question I focus on in my work and in my writing  
is “How can we leverage the best practices of the very best com-  
panies in order to give ourselves the very best chance for continuous  
innovation?”  
Whiletherearemanypracticesthatareimportantandcontribute  
to this, I have long been a champion of the power of the co-located  
product team.  
This Jeff Bezos quote sums up my experiences quite well\:  
At Amazon, a product team has a clear mission, specific goals, and  
needstobecross-functional,dedicated,andco-located.Why?Creativity  
comes from people’s interactions; inspiration comes from intensive  
concentration. Just like a start-up, the team huddles together in a  
garage, experimenting, iterating, discussing, debating, trying and  
retrying,againandagain.

**159** **160** EMPOWERED  
Allthatsaid,formanycompaniestodaythequestionhaschanged.  
Now I’m being asked, “How can we leverage best practices to  
giveourselvesthebestchanceatinnovation,inthescenariowherethe  
product team is distributed and some or all of the team is working  
remotely?”  
Addressing this important question is the subject of this chapter.  
There’s no need to discuss the well-understood tools and meth-  
ods that distributed teams have adopted to communicate and man-  
age their work. I will assume you are already familiar with the range  
of cloud-based collaboration tools, and video-based communication  
services.  
Instead,we’lldivedeeperintothenatureofcross-functionalprod-  
uct teams and discuss where you should focus your attention to con-  
tinue to make forward progress as a team.  
First, there are two major types of activities in every empowered  
product team\: discovery and delivery.  
Whenpeopletalkaboutthemagicofco-location,theyaremainly  
talking about discovery, as in the Bezos quote above.  
Indelivery,it’smore of a trade-off.Communicationis,of course,  
easierwhensitting together, but soareunwantedinterruptions.Over-  
all,Ifindteamswithremoteemployeesdoquitewellindelivery,occa-  
sionally even better than when the team is co-located.  
The real challenge of remote employees is when we consider the  
discovery work.  
The overall methods and mechanics are not really very different  
when working remotely versus co-located for discovery work.  
We still have many product ideas, and we still try them out  
quickly—usually by creating a prototype and then testing on real  
users, either qualitatively or quantitatively.  
Obviously, our qualitative testing is not likely to be literally face  
toface,butwecananddomakeupforthatwithincreasedvideo-based  
testing.  
Theimportantdifferencesimpactthedynamicsofhowtheprod-  
uct manager, product designer, and tech lead collaborate to discover a  
solution worth building.  
There are three serious problems that I consistently see, and any  
of these three can meaningfully damage your ability to innovate. Remote Employees **161**  
# Artifacts  
Assoonasyouseparatetheproductmanagerfromtheproductdesigner  
from the tech lead, a very common anti-pattern arises.  
Insteadofthethreesittingdowntogethertodiscussthequestion  
“How do we solve this problem?” there is a nearly gravity-like pull to  
start producing artifacts for one another.  
The product designer asks the product manager to write down  
some type of “brief” or requirements or constraints.  
Thetechleadasksthedesignerwhenshecanprovidesomewire-  
frames so the engineers can start planning.  
The product manager asks the engineers for estimates.  
Very soon, the new remote work process has reverted back to  
waterfall-like passing along of artifacts. And not only will innovation  
suffer,buttheentirediscussionwillquicklymovebacktooutputrather

Thisisatendencythatyouhavetocontinuouslyfight.Itmayfeel  
less efficient to discuss these topics in a video call between the three  
of you, but it’s essential that you return to the “How do we solve this

During discovery, the main artifact should be prototypes.  
Now,it’struethatonceyoudodecidetobuildsomethingindeliv-

I’ve written earlier about how even one asshole on the product  
team can destroy this dynamic. Fortunately, most people are not  
assholes—at least not in person. Unfortunately, it’s no secret that  
when people are separated from one another, and you’re not speaking  
directly to someone’s face, the normal filters and sensitivity can fade.  
Morethanafewpeoplehavesharedwithmethattheyareseeing

# Time

ductive than ever, especially when it comes to quality time to think  
through hard problems.  
However, many others—especially those with family obligations  
that may include childcare—yearn for the ease of going into the office  
where they can escape the burdens of home life and get work done  
again.  
Therealityisthatnotallmembersofyourproductteamwilllikely

of uninterrupted time at an early or late hour. If the product manager  
and tech lead can find a way to accommodate that, it’s worth doing.  
I realize that none of these three items—artifacts, trust, or  
time—are easy challenges to deal with. They’re not.  
But if you find your distributed team is not delivering the results  
you are used to, this would be where to focus your coaching.  
Withthemembersoftheproductteambeingawareofthepoten-

Unfortunatelyforyou, yourwork as ahiringmanageris just get-

The first three months for a new member of the team are abso-

tenure at your company.  
Some helpful checkpoints along the way\:  
• Attheendofherfirstday.Hasshemadeatleastonehopefullyfuture

team?  
• Aftershereceivesherfirstpaycheck.It’snormalforthenewemployee  
todoasubconsciousassessmentofthechoiceshemadeinjoining

**164** Onboarding **165**  
• Afterherfirstmonth. At this point, the new employee has a fairly  
good idea of the company and her potential in it.  
• After her first 60 days. Has she scored a public “win” that helps  
establish her value to the company?  
Realize that many first impressions will be made—especially by  
senior leaders from across the company—and for many executives,  
there may be few opportunities to correct those first impressions if  
they are not positive.  
No matter how competent the new employee is, there is always  
a ramp-up. Learning about the customers, the people, and workings  
of the company, the culture, the technology, and the industry are all  
critical to coming up to speed.  
One of the first things you’ll want to establish as the hiring man-  
agerishowopenthenewhireistobeingcoached.Mostpeoplearetruly

But there are some who can feel threatened or confused by this.  
Somepeoplehaveitintheirheadsthatiftheyneedtobecoached,  
theremustbesomethingwrongwiththem,andmaybetheyarealready  
at risk in their new job. I’m not a psychologist, but it’s not hard to  
recognize when the new employee is behaving defensively or showing  
signs of insecurity, and to address it up front. I do this by sharing my  
own journey, and how people helped me all along the way.  
One way or another, you need to establish a relationship based  
on trust. You’re trusting that she will put in her best efforts, and she’s  
trusting you will do everything you can to help her succeed.  
Asahiringmanager,IlearnedearlyonthatwhenIinvestedinthe

# APM Programs  
I find that most of the strong tech product companies out there are  
always working to find more very strong product managers.  
Ihavewrittenmanytimesinvariouswaysabouthowcriticalitis  
to put very strong people in these roles, and I meet execs every week  
who tell me they need more.  
OnecompanythatrealizedthisalongtimeagoisGoogle.Their  
first product manager, Marissa Mayer, set a very high bar, and they  
have worked hard over the years to recruit and develop a very strong  
competencyofproductmanagers.MostpeopleknowthatGooglehas  
manyexceptionallystrongengineers,butlessknownishowhardthey  
have worked to develop a set of product managers and designers that  
are worthy of these engineers. Onboarding **167**  
Very early on, they realized that strong product managers were  
in short supply, and one thing they did in response was to establish  
the APM \(associate product manager\) program.  
Sometimes, this name causes confusion because in many com-  
panies outside of Silicon Valley—especially companies using feature  
teams—the term “associate product manager” refers not to this pro-  
gram, but rather to an entry-level, junior product manager. As you’ll  
see,thisprogramisnearlytheoppositeofthat,sopleasedon’tletthe

Google worked hard to find the absolute best and brightest,  
frombothinsideandoutsidethecompany.EntrytotheAPMprogram  
gives the lucky aspiring product manager entrance into a two-year  
coaching program to learn how to become an exceptional product  
manager and eventual product leader.  
The purpose of the program is to take high-performing and/or  
high-potential individuals with a proven or growing track record in  
other areas \(be that business or education\) and coach them into very  
strong product managers.  
Marissa gets most of the credit for this program, and she put  
countless hours into coaching promising product leaders. The pro-  
gramindeedproducedsomeexceptionaltalent.Manyofthesepeople  
arebehindGoogle’sbestproductsandservices,andmanyhavemoved  
on to lead their own companies.  
In the same spirit, I’m most proud of the product people  
I recruited and coached over the years, and I love that they are  
now all across our industry and leading many of the best product  
organizations in the world.  
Iwastaughtthataspeoplemanagersandleaders,ourmostcrit-  
ical job is to develop our people.  
So for medium and larger companies, I often encourage the  
company to set up an APM program for their very high-potential  
product managers.  
Today, many of the top tech companies have APM programs,  
as the concept has spread far beyond Google to Facebook, Twitter,  
LinkedIn, Uber, Salesforce.com, Atlassian, and many more. Some  
\(continued\) **168** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
start the program each year with a new cohort of APMs. Others  
structuretheprogramaroundarotationsotheAPMcangetexposed  
to multiple types of products. There’s no single right way to set up  
these programs, but there are some principles I’d like to share\:  
First, you can only do this program if you have very strong and  
provenproductleaderswhoarebothwillingandabletospendintense  
time coaching. Even if the leaders are at the vice president level, and  
they normally manage other managers, if these leaders are excep-  
tionalandbelieveindevelopingtalent,thenenlistthemtoparticipate  
directly in the coaching.  
If you don’t have these leaders, or they simply do not have the  
necessary bandwidth to provide the required intensity of coaching,  
then you can consider engaging with an external, proven product  
leader who is willing to provide this coaching for you. Give the  
person at least a year to demonstrate results.  
Second, set a very high bar for acceptance into this program.  
Only accept people who are recognized as among your best minds  
and highest potential. The type of person that brings value to every  
conversation.Thetypeofpersonthatisdriventomakethingshappen  
and get results.  
Third, for everyone in this program, do a thorough assessment  
to identify the necessary areas of skills development. Update this  
assessment throughout the year.  
Fourth, put an individualized, one- to two-year coaching plan  
in place to help these people reach their potential. They should be  
meeting 1\:1 with a proven leader at least weekly.  
Of course, the main way we learn how to create great products  
is by jumping in and discovering and delivering great products, so be  
suretoputthesepeoplerightinthethickofitonakeyproductteam.  
But again, you only want to do this if you are providing this person  
with intense and ongoing coaching.  
There are dimensions to this program that you will want to set  
up in a way that is consistent with your company’s culture, such as  
howvisibleandwidelypromotedtheprogramisandtheexpectations Onboarding **169**  
you set with the members. I generally prefer to keep things low key.  
Let the people earn the respect of their peers. Keep this about merit.  
I think it’s worth mentioning that I have found this program  
to be a very effective way to improve diversity in the product  
organization.Thisisbecause,unlikemosthiring,you’renotselecting  
people into this program based on their experience. You’re selecting  
them based on their potential.  
The key is to realize that every tech product company needs  
strong product managers, and the leaders of the company must con-  
stantlyseekthemoutandworkhardtodeveloptheirmostpromising  
people to reach their full potential. **CHAPTER**

# New Employee  
# Bootcamp  
***S***VPG partner Christian Idiodi has built a powerful reputation over the  
years for developing very strong product teams. In his past companies, he  
created his own new employee bootcamp that is an excellent example of coaching  
ordinary people into extraordinary teams. I asked Christian to describe his  
program here.  
Hiring product people is hard—especially product managers,  
product designers, and tech leads.  
The best product people in the world are working for companies

New-hire orientations, while they’re great for helping a new  
employee feel welcomed and integrated into the organization, fall far  
short in preparing product people on some of the more important  
aspects of their role. Things like making hard decisions and gaining a  
high level of trust among peers.  
For example, product managers need to be able to contribute a  
deep knowledge of the customer, the business, the industry, and their  
product.Theirfirstdayonthejob,oreventheirfirstmonth,won’tgive

aseriesoffailedproductpeoplewithintheorganization,andIrealized  
thatthesehireshadbeencompletelycapableforthejob.Buttherewas  
something missing between their capability and their success in the  
organization.  
Seeing this problem, I considered the biggest problems product  
people were facing, along with what they needed to be successful\:  
• How are decisions made? How have they been made in the past?  
• What is important to the company now? What are we working  
toward?  
• How can I get people to trust me?  
• What’s the most important thing to do right now?  
Withthesequestionsinmind,Icreatedafive-dayintensiveboot-  
camp program for product people to participate in during their first  
week on the job.  
Every day starts with a personal-growthcomponent where prod-  
uct people look inward and prepare themselves for the work ahead. **172** EMPOWERED  
Theyparticipateinexercisesoncommunication,personalitytests,  
personal skills, and build a career growth path for themselves. This  
focus on their own personal growth shows these new employees that  
we, the company, care about who they are and their growth. It also  
followstheprincipleof“putonyourownoxygenmaskbeforeassisting  
otherpassengers.”Ifwetrainourleaderstobehealthy,thepeoplewho  
report to them have a better chance, too.  
After personal growth, each day covers a different product train-  
ing topic. We call this Strategic Context.  
Thesearesomeofthemostimportanttopicsthatproductpeople  
need to understand within the company.  
On day 1, we talk about understanding the customer. And while  
most product people understand how to “understand the customer,”  
we bring them through our own company history and put everything  
into context.  
Weshareourvision,financialmodels,talkthroughourcustomer  
discovery, and who our customers have been in the past—and who we  
wantthemtobeinthefuture.Therestoftheweekwetalkthroughval-  
idation, building and prioritizing, learning and measuring, and going  
to market.  
Allofthesetopicsarespecifictotheorganization’sgoalsandhow  
they “get things done,” with the context that gives the product person  
thebackgroundtoreallyunderstandwhereshe’scomingintothestory.  
These topics might change based on what’s important to your  
company and the values it holds, but the process of breaking them  
down—and giving the product person the space to explore—is impor-  
tant and can change the trajectory of her success.  
Right after Strategic Context, we bring in a product person from  
thecompanywhocanspeaktoeachtopicandtellstoriesfromherown  
personal experience. This step might seem small, but it’s key to start  
establishing relationships and trust with other product people. These  
productpeoplecanspeakdirectlytowhatit’sliketoworkonateam,be  
responsible for customers, collaborate with stakeholders, and navigate  
an often-complex company environment.  
After lunch, we enter the Product Workshop, where participants  
takewhattheylearnedinthemorningandapplyitpractically,asifthey  
were on the job. New Employee Bootcamp **173**  
We bring in the team members they’ll be working with, and  
they have a safe space to practice with the guidance of the leadership.  
The learning curve to figuring out how others work is shortened and  
addressed up front, saving everyone time and confusion.

tomakedecisionsquicklyandtherelationshipsshe’salreadybuilthelp

This is how we empower product people—by providing them  
with the information they need to succeed and then trusting them to  
do the right thing.  
Remember\: we’re not hiring smart product people to tell them  
what to do—we’re hiring them to solve hard problems in ways our  
customers love, yet work for our business.  
You have to invest in the product people, more than just a  
new-hire orientation packet.  
Consider implementing a bootcamp to set them up for success  
and give meaning to the work they’ll be doing. **CHAPTER**

was necessary.  
That said, it is absolutely critical that the hiring manager under-  
stand that the annual performance review should never be the primary  
feedback tool. If it is, then in my opinion you have utterly failed as a  
manager.

ber the primary purpose of the 1\:1 is not for the manager, it is for the  
employee.  
As such, there should never be any performance-related surprises  
in the annual review. If there are, you have failed.  
The common case is a manager that is conflict-averse and avoids  
giving the constructive criticism that is so necessary. The manager

HR, and then HR forces the manager to document the issues in a

learn she’s not actually meeting expectations.  
This is unfair to the employee, and in a great many cases, com-  
pletely avoidable.  
WheneverIhavelearnedofthishappeningtooneofthemanagers

the manager and treated it as such. Usually this meant that I wanted to  
see the preparation notes for the weekly 1\:1 going forward, and that  
I would also be discussing the performance issues with the employee  
directly \(to ensure the feedback is making it to her\).

# Terminating  
**T**here’slittlequestionthattheleastfunpartofbeingapeopleman-  
ager is dealing with terminations.  
Of course, the best way to avoid terminations is to develop your  
skills in effective recruiting, interviewing, hiring, onboarding, and  
especially ongoing coaching. And you absolutely should.  
However, there are always occasional situations where it is just  
not working out.  
The first thing to realize is that you should not only consider the  
problem employee. You need to also consider the rest of the product  
teamthatishavingtodealwiththeissuesorcarrytheburden,aswellas  
the message it sends to the product team, the broader product organ-  
ization,andespeciallytotheleadersandstakeholdersbynotcorrecting  
this problem.  
There is a balance between being a compassionate employer and  
actingresponsiblyandpromptly.Thiswillpartlybeafunctionofyour  
company’s culture, and partly a function of the employment laws in  
your country.  
**176** Terminating **177**  
Your partners in HR will help you understand and comply with  
the compliance-related responsibilities.  
I have always drawn a distinction in my own mind about how  
I handle the two main situations when it comes to correcting hiring  
mistakes.  
Thefirstandmostcommonsituationisthattheemployeeissim-  
ply not able to perform the job at the necessary level of competence,  
despite serious ongoing coaching. Normally, I will give sincere best  
efforts for three to six months, but if I can’t coach the person to com-  
petence in that time, I will admit to myself that it is not working. And  
to be clear, I have been sharing the lack of progress with increasing  
urgency and clarity during our weekly 1\:1s.  
But sometimes it just doesn’t work. I have always felt like it was  
partlymyfaultbecauseIhiredthispersonandshouldhavebeenableto  
judgemoreaccuratelyherabilitytoperformthejob\(orourcompany’s  
faultifsomeoneelsewasthehiringmanager\).Inthiscase,Ihavealways  
felt a responsibility to help the person find a more suitable position,  
either at our company or at another.  
Thesecondandthankfullylesscommonsituationisremovingan  
employee that is toxic. By “toxic” I mean that there are some serious  
behavioralissuesthatdamagetrustintheorganizationandleavepeople  
feeling disrespected or worse.  
What’s difficult about these situations is that everyone has an  
occasional bad day or may be dealing with serious problems in their  
personal life. So you need to determine if this is a temporary situation  
or a chronic problem, and if the person has the willingness and ability  
to control her behavior.  
Butagain,threetosixmonthsoftryingtocorrectisaboutnormal.  
If the problem persists, then it’s time to move the focus to protecting  
the psychological safety of the rest of the team and organization.  
Inthiscase,Iamnotwillingtotrytofindthepersonanotherjob,  
at our company or at another, but I am honest with the person about  
theirbehaviorandtheimpactithasonthetrustandcultureintheteam.  
What makes this second situation especially difficult is that often  
the toxic behavior comes along with some exceptionally strong skills,  
and the organization may be nervous about losing these skills. And, in  
truth,theremaybeaperiodofdifficultywhileotherscomeuptospeed. **178** EMPOWERED  
But in every case, I’ve found that removing the toxic person was  
the right thing to do, and that others in the organization would rise  
to the occasion and the broader organization was grateful for the  
improvement in the workplace atmosphere.

# Promoting  
**W**hile terminations might be my least-favorite aspect of staffing,  
there’s no question that promotions are my favorite.  
WhenIfirstbecameapeoplemanager,Iwastaughtthatthemost  
visibleandtangiblesignofsuccessasamanagerwaswhenyourpeople

Nearly every company has career ladders, where people can  
progress in their careers from junior to more-senior roles. Most  
promotions happen within a job class \(e.g., from an engineer to a  
senior engineer to a tech lead to a principal engineer\).  
Butpromotionscanalsocrossjobclasses\(e.g.,fromaseniorprod-  
uct designer to a manager of product design\).  
This, of course, begins with understanding the career aspirations  
of your employees.

Othersaspiretoleadershippositions,orinsomecases,toonedaystart

exposed to different options.  
**179** **180** EMPOWERED  
I have always truly enjoyed these career discussions, and once  
I know the person—and what she likes doing and what she’s good  
at—I’m not shy about sharing what I think the various different  
opportunities are for her.  
But whatever her career goals, I promise her that if she’s willing  
to put in the effort, I’m willing to do my best to help her reach those  
goals. And, furthermore, it’s my job to do that.  
Iliketogiveeachpersonaclearpathtohernextcareergoal.Ido  
that by performing an assessment of her current knowledge and skills  
against what is required for the new role.  
That always generates a list of gaps, and then we discuss how she  
can learn and demonstrate the necessary skills. It can also be useful to  
have the employee do a self-assessment so that you can compare this  
with your own assessment.  
Once she has demonstrated that she is now qualified for the new  
role, then I do everything I can to get her that promotion.  
I’malwaysupfrontwiththepersonthattheremaybeotherswho

But I also explain that the more skilled the person is, the more  
valuablesheistothecompany,soit’sabsolutelyinallofourbestinter-

One special case is worth calling out here, and that is when pro-  
motinganindividualcontributortoapeoplemanagerposition.Thisis,  
of course, not just a more-senior position, but a fundamentally differ-  
ent job, with very different skills and talents necessary. And it’s critical  
that the person understand what’s required and that she want the role  
for the right reasons.  
The main reason tech product companies have dual-track career  
ladders is because money is not a good reason to make this career  
change.  
As a leader, there is nothing I am prouder of than when I see  
people I hired years ago go on to become exceptional leaders them-  
selves.

# Retention  
I’ll repeat the old saying, “People join a company, but leave their  
manager.”  
I \(Marty\) truly believe that this is true. I have done it myself  
\(left because of a terrible manager\) and have seen it happen to others  
countless times.

**182** Leader Profile\: *April Underwood* **183**  
Through persistence in stating her desire to become a product  
manager, and her proficiency as a translator between engineers and  
businesspeople—both within Travelocity and with its partners—April  
landed her first PM role in 2005.  
I first met April in 2007, after she had finished her MBA, an  
internship at Apple, and was broadening her leadership experience at  
Google in a technical, partner-facing organization.  
After Google, April joined Twitter as a Product Manager on the  
Platform,andoverthecourseoffiveyears,sawthecompanygrowfrom  
150 to 4,000 employees. During that time, April’s functional breadth  
expanded as she led not just PM teams, but also business development  
and product marketing teams. Her time at Twitter prepared her for  
more-seniorleadershiprolesasshedevelopedtheabilitytoleadteams  
beyond her own personal area of functional expertise in product.  
In 2015, April joined Slack as Head of Platform and quickly  
stepped up to run product as VP of Product, and ultimately CPO,  
over nearly four years of hypergrowth in revenue and employees. She  
oversawplatformandallaspectsoftheSlackproduct,aswellastwoof  
the critical functions that made Slack stand out among its enterprise

Now April invests in and advises startups with \#Angels—the  
group she co-founded in 2015 with former Twitter colleagues.  
# Leadership in Action  
April’scareerhighlightsthefactthattherearemanypathsintoproduct  
management, and an unlimited number of versions of the role itself.  
In her own words\:  
Early in my career, in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble and  
geographicallyremovedfromSiliconValley,Ihadonearchetypeofthe  
product manager imprinted upon me\: the business-minded MBA who  
is fairly removed from technical choices and engineering execution.  
When I first expressed interest in moving into product manage-  
ment, I was told I needed an MBA to do so. Once I got accepted to  
businessschool,IalsogotwhatI’dwantedattheoutset—theopportu-  
nity to move into a PM role at my then-employer, Travelocity. **184** EMPOWERED  
I took the PM role, but also went on to get my MBA anyway.  
I graduated in 2007 to a vastly different landscape\: the market had  
shifted, and there was an increased emphasis placed on PMs being  
strongly technical. I expected to be well-prepared given the fact I had  
been an engineer, but when I joined Google in 2007, I learned I could  
notbecomeaPMbecauseIlackedacomputersciencedegree\(apolicy  
which has evolved since then\). The goalposts kept moving on me.  
In my last 13 years since then as a product leader, a few patterns  
have become clear to me\:  
The archetype of a product manager evolves with the needs of the market.  
When the core driver of innovation and opportunity has been  
technical, then more-technical PMs have been in favor. When mobile  
emerged as the next frontier, PMs with design sensibility who could  
build apps which could overcome the low switching costs of an App  
Store were prized. When the innovation frontier shifted to operations  
\(think transportation, real estate, hospitality, grocery delivery\), we  
came full circle to value the business orientation necessary for a  
PM-as-a-general manager.  
None of the different models for PM is categorically better, but any given one  
is probably better for a given role.  
InmyroleatSlack,buildingaPMorganizationgrowing5Xover  
five years, I was intentional about what mattered most for each hire\:  
the“flavor”offunctionalexperiencetheyhadasPMs,thesubjectmat-  
ter expertise they brought from the other products they’d built, or the  
company growth stages in which they’d worked. By forcing myself to  
decide what was most important to get right, I was able to narrow the  
candidate field and hire the right type of PM for each role.  
Functional breadth is a prerequisite for moving beyond product leadership to  
company leadership.  
The best product leaders are not just great at defining and build-  
ingproducts—theyunderstandthataproductisonlyasgoodasatarget  
customer’s understanding of why they need it. That a platform is only  
useful if it’s being used in ways which accrue value to the developers  
building on it as well as their customers. That products must be built  
within a set of constraints that preserve the health of the business. Leader Profile\: *April Underwood* **185**  
Theseinsights—thepurviewsofmarketing,partnerships,finance,  
and so many other functions—are important inputs to building  
products.  
Throughout my career, I have worn a variety of different func-  
tional hats—sometimes by choice, to learn a new skill set, and some-  
times because the preferred PM “hat” was out of reach for reasons  
beyond my control.

**187** **188** EMPOWERED  
**M**ost companies have some sort of mission statement that sum-  
marizes the purpose of the business \(e.g., “organize the world’s  
information”\), but a mission statement typically says nothing about  
how we plan to deliver on this mission.  
This is the critical role of the product vision.1

**S**o, what makes a strong and compelling product vision?  
# Customer-Centric  
The product vision is one of our primary tools for keeping the organ-  
ization truly focused on what the customer cares about.  
Realize that we already have company objectives—typically  
describinghow we want to grow the businessand/orreduceoperating  
costs—a company dashboard that shows us the various indicators of  
the health of the business, and team objectives that tell each product  
team what company or customer problems we need to solve.  
So we generally know how our work is intended to benefit our  
company, but we also know that none of this will likely occur if we  
don’t solve problems for the customer.  
**190** Creating a Compelling Vision **191**  
While we need to understand the impact on our company, we  
need to never forget that all of the benefits derive from providing real  
value to our customers.

When we tell the story of the product vision, we do so from the  
perspectiveofourusersandcustomers.Theideaistodemonstratehow  
their lives will improve in some meaningful way.  
When I work with a company on their product vision, one of the  
very first things I do is find a very strong product designer to collab-  
orate with. She may be a senior product designer, or she may be the  
leader of the design organization. Or if the product design organiza-  
tion does not yet have someone with sufficient experience, this is one  
of the rare casesI will encouragethe product leader to engage with an  
experienced product design firm for the purpose of the product vision  
and creating what’s known as a visiontype \(described below\).  
Our job as the broader product organization then is to figure out  
howtodeliveronthepromiseofthevision.Thisrequiresanintentional  
product strategy, and years of continuous discovery and delivery.  
# North Star  
Theproductvision,donewell,servesastheNorth Star fortheproduct  
organization.  
Just as the North Star can guide people to their destination even  
when they’re scattered across the globe, the product vision provides  
this purpose for all of the product teams, no matter where they are  
in the organization, or on what piece of the larger product they’re  
working.  
Assoonasacompanyhasgrowntothepointwheretherearemul-  
tiple product teams—supporting many customers with their constant  
needs—it is very easy for each product team to get caught up in their  
ownproblemsandtheirownwork,losingsightoftheoverarchinggoal.  
The product vision represents the common goal and constantly  
reminds us of the larger purpose. For example, explaining how we’ll **192** EMPOWERED  
address global warming by providing the world’s first mass-market  
electric cars.  
Your team may be responsible for one component of the product  
vision, but we need each and every product team to understand the  
bigger picture\:  
• Ultimately, what is the endgame?  
• How does the work of my team contribute to this larger whole?  
Besurethateverymemberofyourproductteamsunderstandsthe  
answers to these two critical questions.  
Andjusttobeexplicit,itmakesnosenseforeachproductteamto  
have their own product vision. That would totally miss the point. The  
product vision is meant to be the common goal.  
# Scope and Timeframe  
Many companies make the mistake of describing a product vision that  
is not ambitious or meaningful enough. This is especially true when  
the product vision reads more like a roadmap of features.  
The product vision stands little chance of being perceived as  
compelling or meaningful if the team thinks it’s just a matter of a few  
features.  
The product vision describes the future you are trying to create. In  
what ways will you improve the lives of your customers?  
You are not trying to explain how you will get there—that is to  
come from the product strategy and the product discovery work. For  
now, we are just trying to describe what the end state is and why it is  
so desirable.  
Yourroadmapisjustasetoffeaturesandprojectsthatyoubelieve  
might help you get there.  
Normally, the timeframe for the product vision is between 3 and  
10 years out. Very complex products and devices are at the longer end  
of this range. Creating a Compelling Vision **193**

ogy.

Mostofthetime,ourproductvisionleveragesoneormoremajor  
industry trends.  
Examples of major technology trends as of this writing include  
mobile,cloudcomputing,bigdata,machinelearning,augmentedreal-  
ity, internet of things, edge computing, and consumerization of the  
enterprise.  
Note that industry trends are not limited to technology trends.  
There are other trends that are critically important, such as changing  
behaviors of groups of users, and changing buying patterns.  
I can only guess at what the major trends will be in 5 or 10 years,  
but I’m certain there will be several additions to this list.  
Interestingly, I am also quite confident that most if not all of this  
list of current trends will still be relevant in 5 or 10 years. The real  
trends are not fleeting.  
Rememberthatcustomersdon’tcareaboutourtechnology—they  
care about how well we solve their problems. So, while we may make  
a bet on specific technologies, we must always keep in mind the  
purpose of that technology is to solve problems in ways that  
customers love.  
# Who Owns the Product Vision?  
The head of product is responsible for ensuring the organization has  
a compelling product vision, as well as the product strategy that can  
deliver on that product vision.  
That said, the reality is more nuanced than that.  
\(continued\) **194** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
First,inordertocomeupwithacompellingproductvision,the  
headofproductwillneedtoworkverycloselywiththeheadofdesign  
and the head of technology.  
The product vision is a critical collaboration between the cus-  
tomer experience, the enabling technologies, and the needs of the  
business. It will likely require the talents and best efforts of all three.  
Second, to succeed, the CEO \(or GM for a business unit in a  
very large organization\) is going to need to feel a very real sense of  
ownership of this product vision.  
In many startups, the CEO is the effective head of product, so  
this happens naturally. But in other companies, the head of product  
needs to involve the CEO enough that she feels a true connection to  
this vision.

Thatdoesn’tmeantheCEOneedstocreatetheproductvision,

# Vision  
**A**compelling product vision is the gift that keeps on giving.  
# Communicating the Product Vision  
It’sworthinvestingsomerealtimeandeffortintothebestwaytocom-  
municate the product vision. Remember that the vision’s purpose is to  
inspire. PowerPoint presentations rarely inspire anyone.  
The minimum is typically to create a visiontype, and we often  
produce a video of this visiontype. A visiontype is a conceptual  
prototype—a high-fidelity user prototype \(realistic looking, but  
completely smoke and mirrors—and because of that, it is very easy to  
create, and most important, not constrained by what we know how  
to build\).  
**195** **196** EMPOWERED  
The difference between a high-fidelity user prototype used as a  
visiontype,andahigh-fidelityuserprototypeusedinproductdiscovery,  
is the scope of what’s covered by the prototype.  
The visiontype describes the world once the vision is a  
reality—that may be 3 years or 10 years in the future.  
The product discovery prototype describes the new feature or  
experience for something we will likely build in the coming weeks.  
Onceyouhavethisvisiontype,youcanshowit\(demoit\)toanyone  
you like. But many companies today are taking a little extra time and  
effort and producing a scripted video designed to show off the vision-  
type in the best light possible.  
Thismaymeanshowinghowdifferenttypesofuserswouldexpe-  
rience the product, and leveraging the emotional power of music and  
a thoughtful script to help increase the impact.  
Another effective way to communicate a product vision is with  
storyboarding, much like what is done to create and share an outline  
of a movie.  
As with a video showing off a visiontype, a storyboard focuses on  
the emotion and the customer experience and not on the details.  
Because this is about communicating a product vision, and  
because the product vision is meant to be told from the users’ per-  
spective, your product designers will need to play a key role—both  
in crafting the experience and in determining the best way to  
communicate that experience.

vision was available today, do people have the problems we think they Sharing the Product Vision **197**  
have?Aretheproblemsseriousenough,andtheircurrentoptionsweak  
enough, that they’re open to new solutions?  
What we can’t validate is the solution. That’s simply because we  
don’tyetknowthesolution.Mostlikely,itwilltakeusyearsofworkto  
discover the components of the solution.  
And, of course, while it’s good to know we are working on a  
worthyproblem,that’snotenough.Peoplewillonlybuyiftheybelieve  
we have solved the problem well enough to get them to switch.  
This is why we explain that pursuing a product vision is largely a  
leap of faith. We’re betting on ourselves; that we’ll be able to discover  
a solution that delivers on the promise of the vision.  
# Product Vision as a Recruiting Tool  
Strong product people want to work on something meaningful. They  
want to work on something larger than themselves. They want to be  
missionaries and not mercenaries.  
So,whileyoucantalkaboutniceemployeebenefitsandshowthe

your product vision than anything else.

As a leader, this is one of your most powerful tools. The vision

Why? Because in ways large and small, they will all need to help  
for your vision to reach its full potential.  
One other critical point, especially for product leaders. Evange-

# Sharing Product Vision vs. Roadmaps  
Incompanieswithadirectsalesforce,whicharegenerallytheretosell  
tolargerbusinesses,itisnotunusualforthesalesforcetobeaskedto  
share product roadmaps with current or prospective customers.  
It’s important to understand where this is coming from. These  
customers or prospective customers are making a significant bet on  
your company. They know they are not just buying your offering  
today—they are buying your offering over time, usually for many  
years. So it’s not in the least unreasonable for them to want to make  
surethatyouareheadinginthesamedirectionthattheybelievethey  
need to go.  
So,thestandardwayofrequestingthatistoasktoseetheprod-  
uct roadmap, because that’s usually the only option.  
The problem with this, as experienced product people know, is  
thatmanyifnotmostofthespecificproductfeaturesthatwethinkwill

foredonotprovidethenecessaryvalue.Sospendingthetimetobuild

Which is why we would much rather share the product vision  
than a product roadmap.  
Thoughthecustomersdon’tgenerallyusethisterminology,the  
product vision is usually what they’re hungry for.  
Fromyourpointofview,wewouldmuchrathershareaproduct  
vision than a product roadmap because it is a near certainty that,  
based on what you learn, you will want to change your roadmap  
often. But if a customer has made a purchase decision based on a Sharing the Product Vision **199**

Itistruethatsomecompaniesconsidertheproductvisiontobe  
proprietary and don’t want to share it, but I much prefer to share the

It’s also true that many companies are not allowed to share  
a product roadmap because it can and will be interpreted as a  
forward-lookingstatement,andifyoudonotdeliveronthepromised  
features, there could be legal ramifications.  
There are of course cases where you’ll get specific questions,  
suchas\:“WeuseSalesforce.comhere,andbeforewebuy,canyoutell  
us if and when your solution will integrate with their platform?” It’s  
not hard to see how that would be a reasonable question. Whether  
or not you integrate would be a strategic product decision, which  
youcouldansweronceyouunderstandthenatureandpurposeofthe  
integration they’re looking for, and whether you believe it is impor-  
tant for your general offering and not just a one-off special request.  
The timing question, if you believe it’s required, would be treated as  
a high-integrity commitment, which is described in detail in Part VII.  
Remember\: stubborn on vision, but flexible on details. Sharing  
the vision is fine, but sharing a roadmap is very dangerous.  
# Product Vision and Architecture  
So much derives from the product vision.  
The engineering organization needs the product vision so that  
they can ensure that the architectural decisions they make will serve  
the needs of that product vision.  
Note that it’s not necessary, or even usually desirable, for the  
engineers to build out in one major effort the full architecture that is  
necessary for the product vision. But it is essential that the engineers  
know what the endgame is so they can make good choices along the  
way and avoid having to reengineer, possibly even multiple times.

\(continued\)  
For example, the product vision may imply that the product  
eventuallyneedstobeabletomakehighlyaccuratepredictionsabout  
howtopersonalizeauser’sexperience.Eventhoughmachine-learning  
capabilities may not be an immediate need, simply knowing this is  
coming will have real implications for how the engineering team  
architects the product.  
Similarly, the team topology \(described in Part V\) is heavily  
impacted by the product vision and the architecture, especially for  
platform teams that encapsulate the underlying services.  
A product architecture informed by vision becomes especially  
critical in organizations suffering from serious technical debt.

# Product Principles  
# and Ethics  
**P**roduct principles complement the product vision by stating the  
values and beliefs that are intended to inform the many product  
decisions that will need to be made.  
When we empower product teams, we are giving them problems  
to solve, and we are giving them the context required to make good  
decisions.The product visionis a major part of that context, but there  
will always be issues that arise during the product discovery and deliv-  
ery work.  
A few of these issues will be major enough that the product team  
will want to escalate them to a broader group of product leaders and  
impacted stakeholders. But for the majority of normal product deci-  
sions, we can provide the team with the information they need. The  
product principles play a major role in this.  
So many decisions revolve around trade-offs, and the product  
principles help to illuminate the values we prioritize when we make  
these trade-offs.  
**201** **202** EMPOWERED  
The product team needs to understand these principles and the  
reasoning behind each one.  
As a very common example, in most products, there are often  
trade-offs between ease of use and security. Clearly both ease of use  
andsecurityareimportantbenefitsforusers,andit’salsotruethatthese  
twogoalsarenotalwaysatodds.Butwhenthesegoalsare atodds,this  
is where product principles can help. To continue with the example,  
this conflict often shows up when focused on rapid growth.  
If the company is focused on growth, the teams will likely invest  
heavily in ease of use and may in fact downgrade the importance of  
security in order to remove friction.  
Itisnothardfortheproductleaderstoanticipatethatmanyprod-  
uct teams will face this sort of trade-off decision, and while it’s impos-  
sible to anticipate every situation, it is not impossible to consider and  
then state the important principles.  
Decisions related to ethics are another good example. While we  
can’t anticipate every situation where ethics may be an issue, we can  
discusstheprincipleswebelieveareimportantwhenitcomestoethics.  
Suppose a product solution provides real value for one group of  
users when used as intended, but the team realizes that if the product  
were to be used maliciously, it could hurt in some way another group  
of users. What are the team’s responsibilities in terms of preventing  
unintended use?  
Astheproductleaderscreatetheproductvision,Iencouragethem  
to also prepare a set of product principles to complement the vision,  
and to think through and provide as much guidance to the product  
teams regarding ethics as possible.1

strategic context that they use most often in their daily discovery work, and these princi-  
ples and the topic of ethics in particular are increasingly important with the advent of new  
technologies—especially related to machine learning. **CHAPTER**

I first met Audrey in 1996 at Netscape,  
where she was, even then, establishing a  
reputation as someone very smart who  
knew how to get things done. I remem-

# Leadership in Action  
Audrey’s leadership style is best explained in her own words\:  
My earliest experiences managing and being managed were in  
theater, and much of my management style grew out of that.  
Most people can’t even start summer jobs until they’re 15 or  
so, but I started acting in plays when I was around 10 years old, and  
continued through middle school, high school, a bachelor’s degree,  
and several years after graduating—until I found design at Netscape.  
Don’t get me wrong, it was far from being a career, but I spent  
many, many hours on stage, in the costume shop, backstage, and  
even doing some directing. I’m certain it informed my approach to  
leadership.

Similarly, I try to set a vision, and to make my goals  
explicit—collaborating on goals before firming them up for myself  
and the team.  
I love this kind of big-picture puzzle solving, and it’s my favorite  
thing to do with teams—gauge and clarify constraints, weigh goals

# It’s Not About You  
Adirectorcastsanactorforaspecificrolebecauseshebelievesthatthe  
way that particular person will play the part will be great. There is a  
very old, very firm rule in directing\: no line readings. A line reading is  
when the director says the actor’s lines to her in the hopes of getting  
the actor to mimic them.  
This is a huge no-no and implies that either the director isn’t  
skilled enough to get the performance she wants out of the actor, or  
that the best the actor has to offer is her ability to mimic the director.

Rarely is the director the most highly skilled at any of the jobs that

The most rewarding experiences of my career have been iden-

and then convincing them that they’re great at whatever the thing is.  
And working with a team—all operating in ways that they are  
passionate about or excel at—means being part of something so much  
greater than the strengths of any one individual person. Those teams  
are transformational, both in terms of how it feels to belong to one,  
and what they can accomplish.

# Critique  
In both theater and film, a director will “give notes” regularly. The  
cadence might be hourly, per scene, or per performance, but giving  
constructivefeedback—whetherit’s“Thatwasgreat,domoreofit,”or, Leader Profile\: *Audrey Crane* **207**  
“Totallyconfusedbyyourchoicethere”—isagiveninanyrelationship

# Team Topology  
**209** **210** EMPOWERED  
**M**ost technology products today are large and complicated.  
Though there are exceptions, it’s rare that an entire product  
will be developed by a single product team. Most products require  
many teams working together—dozens or even hundreds.  
This means that every product organization must deal with the  
question of how to structure their product teams in order to best divide  
the work.  
I’ve written about this topic of structuring and scoping product  
teams before, including in INSPIRED.  
However, because this topic relates so strongly to the level of  
empowerment, in this series of chapters I want to go deeper.  
I’ve started referring to this topic of team scoping as team  
topology.  
1 I like this term because it captures the idea of an arrangement  
of constituent parts in a larger system.  
A product organization’s team topology answers questions  
such as\:  
• How many product teams should our organization have?  
• What is the scope of responsibility of each team?  
• What are the skills required for each team, and how many of each  
skill?  
• What are the dependencies between the teams?  
More generally, the topology helps answer the question of how a  
company should organize its product people into teams to best enable them to  
do great work.  
If you are a product leader, establishing an effective team topology  
is one of your key responsibilities. It’s also one of the most complex  
because there are so many factors to consider. This has always been  
true, but with the rapid rise of remote employees, there is another layer  
of complexity impacting the topology.  
1The term was coined by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais in their book, Team Topologies\:  
Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow \(Portland, OR\: IT Revolution, 2019\). Team Topology **211**  
First and foremost, your topology choices should be guided by  
principles that support team empowerment.  
These include giving teams real ownership of the space of prob-  
lems they will be responsible for, providing autonomy in their ability to  
deliver the solutions to the problems they’re asked to solve, and align-  
ment with various aspects of the company’s customers, business, and  
technology.  
Alignment itself is complex and requires reconciling the scope  
of individual teams with the broader context of business goals, types  
of customers, organizational reporting structure, technology architec-  
ture, and product vision.  
Another important consideration is the number and nature of the  
dependencies between product teams. Every topology creates its own  
set of dependencies between product teams, and leaders must consider  
the trade-offs.  
Finally, even though we work hard to keep teams stable and  
durable, leaders must consider that the team topology will need to  
evolve over time as the needs and circumstances change.  
One practical point to keep in mind as you consider the points in  
the chapters that follow\: The team topology you choose needs to be  
a decision made by the leaders of product and design, and the leaders  
of engineering, working together. The best topology will balance the  
needs of these key product leaders.  
In the next several chapters, we’ll explore these considerations and  
how they relate to empowerment. We’ll also describe common patterns  
for designing team topologies and when to use them. **CHAPTER**

# Optimizing for  
# Empowerment  
**E**arlyinthisbook,weintroducedtheconceptofteam topology torefer  
to the way we organize our people into teams to best enable them  
to do great work.  
Becauseteamtopologydefinestheboundariesbetweenteamsand  
establishesthescopeofproblemseachteamwillconsider,it’soneofthe  
most important decisions faced by product leaders.  
Still, many companies don’t give this decision the thought it  
needs.  
Too often, team topology happens organically by following the  
path of least resistance. It may mirror an existing organizational chart  
or engineering skill set grouping, or it may track with the operational  
responsibilities of some business owner or stakeholder.  
While these factors may sometimes be a good way to set bound-  
aries between particular teams, that decision should be made inten-  
tionallyafterconsideringawiderangeoffactors.Notopologydecision  
should be made just because it’s easy.  
**212** Optimizing for Empowerment **213**  
Inmanycases,theteamtopologywassetyearsearlier,andpeople  
are reluctant to change the structure. What started off as a rational  
grouping is now creating unnecessary dependencies or complications  
thatworkagainstteamempowerment.Here,leadersmayneedtomake  
hard decisions to restructure all or part of their topology.  
The bottom line is that, if you are a product leader, the empow-  
erment of your company’s product teams is greatly impacted by your  
topology choices.  
Optimizing for empowerment requires balancing three inter-  
related goals\: ownership, autonomy, and alignment.  
# Ownership  
Ownershipisbiggerthanjusttheteam’sobjectives.Itsetsthescopeof  
eachteam’sfullresponsibilitiesaroundfunctionality,experience,qual-  
ity, performance, and technical debt. Teams are expected to make the  
necessary trade-offs to best address the work that fits into their scope  
of ownership.  
Empowermentimproveswheneachproductteamhassomething  
meaningful that they are responsible for.  
When a team has a very narrow scope of responsibility, its mem-  
bers can find it hard to stay motivated. They don’t understand how  
their work relates to the broader business goals, and they can feel like  
a small cog in a big wheel.  
Bycontrast,ateamthatseesitselfasresponsibleforameaningful  
problemisinspiredbytheirconnectiontothelargercause.Theyhave  
more pride of ownership.  
Inmostcases,alargerscopeofownershipisbetterforempower-  
ment,butempowermentcanalsosufferwhenthescopeofresponsibil-  
ity is too broad for a team’s size and skill set.  
For example, consider a team that has ownership of a product  
experiencebutalsorequirestechnicalknowledgeofoneormorecom-  
plex systems just to make basic changes. Such a team may struggle to  
gain the depth of understanding they need to innovate in their area of **214** EMPOWERED  
ownership. This high level of cognitive load works against the empow-  
erment of the team.  
Empowerment doesn’t just depend on the scope of ownership—it  
also requires clarity of ownership. When teams are unclear on which  
work applies to them, their empowerment is undermined. While you  
should expect that there will always be occasional cases where own-  
ership of work is ambiguous, a good topology should resolve more  
ownership questions than it raises.  
# Autonomy  
Autonomy is a powerful concept, yet is often misunderstood by lead-  
ership and product teams alike.  
It does not mean that a team should never have dependencies on  
otherproductteams.Nordoesitmeanthatateamisallowedtogooff  
and pursue whatever it likes.  
Autonomy does meanthatwhenwegiveteams problemsto solve,  
they have enough control so that they can solve the problem in the  
best possible way that they see fit. A topology that results in too many  
dependencies can make this difficult.  
We expect teams to use the tools of product discovery to explore  
differentoptionsandapproachesbeforecommittingtoasolution.And  
we trust the decisions they make because we know the team is in the  
best position to make them.

Forexample,atopologythatdividesteamsstrictlybytechnology

Ultimately, empowering teams is about enabling them to figure  
out the best way to achieve the necessary business outcomes. Team  
autonomy contributes to this. Optimizing for Empowerment **215**  
# Alignment  
Alignmentreferstohowwelltheboundariesbetweenteamstrackwith  
other aspects of the strategic context.  
When alignment is high, teams generally have fewer dependen-  
cies to get things done. They can make faster decisions and are more  
connected with business-level outcomes.  
In short, when alignment is high, empowerment is improved.  
Alignment is typically the most complicated aspect of topology  
because there are so many dimensions to consider. The two most sig-  
nificant of these are the architecture and the business.  
Let’s first consider alignment with the architecture. Ideally, the  
architectureisbasedontheproductvision,asthejobofthearchitecture  
is to enable the product vision.  
If that’s the case, a topology that aligns with technical architec-  
ture will also be naturally aligned with the product vision. Teams can  
ownameaningfulscopeandcanbegivenautonomytomakesignificant  
product decisions.  
However, in companies with large amounts of technical debt  
and/orlegacysystems,teamsmaynotbealignedwiththearchitecture.  
Their work is cluttered with dependencies and complexity. Even  
simple tasks can take a long time, if they’re even feasible at all.  
Alignment with the business includes how the product team  
relates to the organization—for example, to different business units,  
differentgo-to-marketstrategies,differentcustomertypes,ordifferent  
market segments.  
We’llexplorethealignmenttopicinmoredepthintheupcoming

therearesomeimportantbestpracticesthatcanhelpyouoptimizeyour

In this chapter we consider the two fundamental types of prod-  
uct teams\: platform teams, which manage services so they can be easily  
leveraged by other teams, and experience teams, which are responsible  
for how the product value is exposed to users and customers.  
It’simportanttoemphasizethatanytopologymustconsiderboth  
theunderlyingtechnologyarchitectureaswellasthebroaderstrategic  
context\(includingthebusinessobjectives,productvision,strategy,etc.\)  
of the product.  
This means that it’s essential that product and engineering lead-  
ership must determine the topology together.  
**216** Team Types **217**  
# Platform Teams  
Platform teams provide leverage because they allow for common ser-  
vices to be implemented once but used in many places. Examples of  
this include\:  
• A platform team that is responsible for shared services such as  
authentication or authorization  
• A platform team that is responsible for maintaining a library of  
reusable interface components  
• A platform team that is responsible for providing tools to devel-  
opers for test and release automation  
Platform teams also allow for managing complexity because they  
canencapsulateparticularlydifficultorspecializedareasoftheproduct.  
Examples of this include\:  
• Aplatformteamthatcreatesanabstractionforintegrationwitha  
legacy system  
• A platform team that manages payment processing  
• Aplatformteamthatmanagesahighlyspecializedtaxcalculation  
Your end customers—and even your executives and stake-  
holders—may not have any direct visibility into the work performed  
by your platform teams, but don’t think these teams aren’t important.  
Infact,inmanyofthetopproductorganizations,thebestengin-  
eers in the company are asked to work on platform teams because of  
the leverage and importance.  
In a small company, the platform may be provided by a single  
platform team. In many of the large, top tech companies, as many as  
half of the product teams are platform teams.  
Moreover, platforms reduce the cognitive load for experience  
teams.

# Experience Teams  
Experience teams are responsible for how the product is experienced  
by users in the form of apps, UIs, solutions, or journeys.  
Usersmaybecustomerswhobuyyourproduct,or\(inthecaseof  
B2B products\) they may be the employees of those customers. What-  
everthecase,ifaproductteamisworkingontheexperienceforanyone  
whoispartofthecompany’scustomers—includingconsumers—thisis  
called a customer-facing experience team.  
Usersmayalsobeinternaltoyourcompanyitselfbutarecritically  
important for delivering the necessary customer experience.  
Examples of these types of users are customer service agents  
or in-store associates. If a product team is working on a product  
experience for these types of internal employees, this is called a  
customer-enabling experience team.  
Whether a team is customer-facing or customer-enabling, a true

be divided into teams by user type, by market or segment, by the step  
in a customer’s journey, or by any number of other ways \(more on this  
in Chapter 44 on empowering experience teams\).  
In too many companies, the topology is defined such that each  
experience team owns only a very small part of the end-to-end experi-  
ence. In this situation, each team struggles to feel like they can make  
an impact without coordinating with every other team, even for small  
changes.  
By contrast, experience teams are most empowered when they  
are given as much end-to-end responsibility as possible. Such teams have  
a meaningful sense of ownership, more autonomy, and it’s easier for  
them to see their impact on solving customer problems and achieving  
business results. Team Types **219**  
Manystrongcompanieshavefoundthatarichplatformisapow-  
erful tool for enabling a broader \(end-to-end\) scope of ownership for  
the experience teams.  
Platform teams reduce the load required to use the underlying  
technology, creating cognitive capacity for experience teams to own  
more aspects of the customer problems. **CHAPTER**

# Empowering Platform  
# Teams  
**I**n the previous chapter, I introduced the two main types of product  
teamsanddescribedhowplatformteamscreateleverageandencap-  
sulate complexity for experience teams.  
Platform teams raise the level of empowerment for other teams  
by abstracting away the underlying complexity of the services and the  
architecture.  
The topic of empowerment for platform teams is always a little  
tricky. That’s because, while the purpose of an experience team is to  
solveproblemsforusersandcustomers,thepurposeofaplatformteam  
is really to enable the experience teams to better solve problems for their cus-  
tomers. So, the contribution of a platform team is indirect.  
Tounderstandhowthisimpactsplatformteams,ithelpstosepar-  
atethetwotypesofworkthatallproductteams—platformandexperi-  
ence teams alike—must do.  
On the one hand, they are moving the purpose of their team for-  
ward.That’stheirmainwork,andwe’llcomebacktothatinaminute.  
**220** Empowering Platform Teams **221**  
However, every product team also has some amount of what we  
call “keep-the-lights-on” obligations.1  
This is the daily work necessary to keep the business running.  
Things like fixing critical bugs, addressing performance issues, and  
adding critical capabilities for nonnegotiable things that come up,  
such as compliance issues.  
It is true that platform teams tend to have more of these  
keep-the-lights-on items than the average experience team, and that’s  
because of the nature of the work involved in enabling the teams that  
depend on them.  
Thismightbe10percentoftheplatformteam’swork,oritmight  
be closer to half of the work.  
So, separating out the keep-the-lights-on work, there are two  
main ways that platform teams are empowered to move the platform  
forward\: shared team objectives and platform-as-a-product objectives.  
# Shared Team Objectives  
The most common way for a strong platform team to pursue major  
work is through shared team objectives. With shared team objectives,  
the platform team has the same objective as one or more experience  
teams.  
We will discuss the mechanics of shared team objectives in  
Chapter 57, Collaboration, but for now it’s sufficient to say that the  
teams work together to discover and develop the solution.  
Sometimes the collaboration is very deep, essentially requiring  
the teams to work together closely, almost as one team.  
For example, consider a content management system \(CMS\)  
product, and let’s suppose you have a platform team that manages  
backend storage and API access to content, and an experience team  
that manages the user-facing content workflow. Suppose further that,  
so far, the CMS system works with image content, but because of a  
newmarketexpansionstrategy,itneedstonowsupportvideocontent.  
1Some companies call this “BAU,” for “business as usual,” but I have never liked that term  
because too many companies think that’s all a product team does. **222** EMPOWERED  
Here, our platform team and experience team may have a shared  
team objective to enable video. The two must work together very  
closely to determine the appropriate experience as well as how it will  
be implemented.  
In other cases, the collaboration can be more segmented. The  
platform team and experience team may be able to define an API  
that represents a form of contract between the platform team and the  
experience team, and then each team is able to work largely  
independently to complete their work.  
For example, an e-commerce company may be adding a new  
payment type. A platform team manages all payment complexity  
and exposes it to experience teams as an API. The product team  
responsible for the checkout experience creates the user-facing flows,  
while the platform team implements the integration with the backend  
payment processes. The two teams come together for testing and  
delivery.  
Whether the collaboration is deep or segmented, the important  
thingisthattheplatformteamhasthesamestrategiccontextandgoal  
as the experience team. They are connected as to why the work is  
important, and what it means for the business.  
# Platform-as-a-Product Objectives  
For some companies, their products are platforms. What they sell are  
APIsthatallowtheircustomersandusers\(usuallydevelopers\)tobuild  
on those capabilities. We call these external platforms.  
In this case, the platform is the product, and it is treated as such.  
The customers and users may be developers rather than consumers,  
but it’s a true product nevertheless.  
On a related note, an emerging trend is that a growing number  
ofcompaniesareworkingtomanagetheirinternal platformsmorelike

Withtheseplatformproducts,it’snormaltofindobjectiveslook-  
ing much as for experience products—growing the number of cus-  
tomers,gettingcustomerstoadoptthecapabilities,orbettermonetize

Justaswithanyproductteam,experience,orplatform,ifwehada  
majorqualityissueorperformanceissueordeveloper-experienceissue,  
rather than just consider this part of normal keep-the-lights-on work,  
we could elevate this to a team objective.

# Empowering Experience  
# Teams  
**A**s we described earlier, experience teams are responsible for how  
the product value is perceived by the actual users or customers.  
Akeypointwasthatexperienceteamsaremostempoweredwhen  
they are given as much end-to-end responsibility as possible.  
This is more likely to happen when the scope of ownership for  
each team follows other natural patterns of the business such as the  
sales channel, market segment, or user type.  
More often than not, this means creating a topology that is aligned  
by customer.  
Here are some examples of alignment by customer\:  
• By user type or persona \(e.g., Riders Team, Drivers Team\)  
• By a market segment \(e.g., Electronics Team, Fashion Team\)  
• By customer journey \(e.g., Onboarding Team, Retention Team\)  
• By sales channel \(e.g., Self-Service Team, Direct Sales Team\)  
**224** Empowering Experience Teams **225**  
• By business KPI \(e.g., New-User Growth Team, Conversion  
Team\)  
• By geography \(e.g., North America Team, Asia Pacific Team\)  
This alignment means that experience teams have areas of own-  
ership that match the outcomes that the business needs. There is lit-  
tlerequiredtranslationbetweenbusinessoutcomesandproductwork,  
and the teams can be given the autonomy to solve business problems  
directly.  
Aligningbycustomermeansdifferentthingsfordifferenttypesof  
products.Whatfollowsaresomeexamplesofalignment.Thisisbyno  
means an exhaustive list, and these are not the only ways to organize  
the experience team topology for the cases mentioned. All that said,  
thesearesomecommonpatternsthathaveproveneffectiveandmight  
be applicable for your own topology.  
# Media Product  
For magazines, news sites, or video-on-demand services, experience  
teams can be organized by content section or sub-publication.  
Allcontentmanagementandcommoncapabilitiesarehandledby  
platform teams that provide generalized services to a set of experience  
teams \(these may constitute the majority of the product staff\).  
Each experience team then covers the end-to-end needs for each  
media category \(e.g., sports, local news, weather\) or brand. In some  
cases, several similar categories may be covered by a single team, and  
larger or more specialized experiences would have their own teams.  
This approach helps ensure that needs of different types of cus-  
tomers are met. It also aligns the experience teams with the different  
per-categorybusinessgoalsandgo-to-marketstrategiesthatareusually  
common in these companies.  
# E-Commerce Product  
E-commercecanfollowasimilarpatterntomediaproducts,especially  
when the shopping experience differs significantly by category \(e.g.,  
auto parts vs. tickets to events vs. jewelry\). **226** EMPOWERED  
Again, the product is built upon a rich platform of common ser-  
vices\(catalogmanagement,billing,accountmanagement,etc.\)Experi-  
ence teams are then aligned by the category.  
# Enterprise Product  
Enterprise products frequently must be specialized for different  
segments of customers. Sometimes, there are differences by the  
customer’s vertical market \(e.g., manufacturing vs. financial services  
vs. retail\). Sometimes there are very significant differences based on  
the go-to-market strategy. Sometimes there are differences because  
of the customer’s size \(e.g., SMBs are reached through a self-service  
portal, while larger customers require a sales force and APIs for  
customization\).  
Here,itcanmakesensetoorganizeexperienceteamsbywhatever  
segmentation is most relevant to the company. Once again, the goal is  
toorganizetheexperienceteamsinawaythatallowsthemtobestserve  
theirspecificcustomerandalsoalignwithotherpartsofthecompany.  
# Marketplace Product  
Many products have the purpose of connecting different groups of  
people who have complementary goals\: such as buyers and sellers,  
driversandriders,hotelsandguests.Mostmarketplacesaretwo-sided,  
but they can have more.  
In most cases, the needs of the individuals on each side of the  
marketplace are quite distinct. This is also true of the rest of the  
business that is trying to support each side.  
Forbothofthesereasons,itisoftenempoweringforthetopology

# Customer-Enabling Product

part of the customer experience. Empowering Experience Teams **227**  
Thismightincludesystemstoenablecustomerserviceorin-store

Here again, a topology can empower experience teams by align-  
ing them with the end-to-end needs of the different types of company  
internal users.  
Onefinalnoteonthis\:Yourtopologyneednotalignallexperience  
teams to a single dimension such as vertical market or customer size.  
Some topologies use different alignment dimensions in different areas  
when that makes more sense.  
# Topology and Design  
Most companies understand that a cross-functional product team, at  
least for an experience team, includes a dedicated product designer.  
This is an acknowledgement of how critically important product  
design is to strong products.  
Occasionally, however, the company has a design leader who  
prefers a different model, referred to as the internal agency model. In  
this case, the design leader has a service team of designers, and the  
productteamsneedtomakerequestsofthisdesignteamtogetdesigns  
produced for their products.  
It’sonlyfairtoacknowledgethatthisapproachdoeshavecertain  
advantages—especially in terms of ensuring a holistic view of design.  
However, in the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda \(via Aaron  
Burr\), it’s essential to be “in the room where it happens.”  
In the internal design agency model, the designer is usually  
not in the room when the key decisions get made, and therefore the  
designer—and ultimately our users—have to pay the price for that.  
Design is far too important to be run as an internal service. It  
needstobeafirst-classmemberoftheproductteam,justastheprod-  
uct manager and tech lead are.  
The design manager can ensure a holistic view of design by  
establishingdesignstandards,guidelines,anddesignsystems;review-  
ing the work of the designers; and also by conducting design strategy  
and review sessions with the broader group of product designers.  
Note that for companies using feature teams, this reallydoesn’t  
matter because the key decisions have already been made by the time  
the designer is first consulted. **228** EMPOWERED  
# Topology and Reporting Structure  
It’sverycommonforanengineeringreportingstructuretobeorgan-  
ized around specific skill sets. For example, groups of data engineers,  
front-end engineers, and mobile engineers each typically report to  
separate managers. This ensures any engineering manager is able to  
provide skill-specific coaching to every engineer on her team.  
This is not a problem, but it can be tempting for technology  
leaders to want to completely align the product teams with such a  
reporting structure. For example, making a single product team of  
just front-end engineers.  
This approach rarely produces empowered product teams  
becausetheproblemisthattheteamsdon’talignwithanythingother  
than technical skill sets. These rarely have any real bearing on the  
outcomes that the business needs.  
Forexample,atopologythatdividestheorganizationintoaweb  
team, iOS team, Android team, and backend team will make it very  
difficult to give any team the ability to own a multichannel customer  
experience.  
ThefamouscomputerscientistMelvinConwaycoinedanadage  
thatisoftenreferredtoasConway’s Law.Itstatesthatanyorganization  
that designs a system will produce a design whose structure mirrors  
the organization’s structure.  
Another way to say this is to beware of shipping your org chart.  
One of the biggest benefits of cross-functional teams is that  
membership can be determined by what is best for the product.  
The bottom line is that there is no reason that reporting rela-  
tionships should dictate team topology. **CHAPTER**

# Topology and  
# Proximity  
**S**ofar,we’vetalkedaboutthecompositionofproductteamsandhow  
to scope them, but we haven’t discussed the dimension of physic-  
al location of those teams. When creating the team topology, this is  
another important and practical factor to consider.  
Even before the pandemic, there was a trend around moving to  
alternative office strategies mainly driven by the shortage of available  
talent and very high costs of living in major technology hubs.  
In many companies, there is simply no practical way to hire  
enough people with the necessary skills at the same location as the  
company’s headquarters, so they’re forced to consider options.

everyoneworkinginthesameofficecenter,butduetolackofavailable  
**229** **230** EMPOWERED  
talent and high costs of living, they opt to move their headquarters to  
a new location.  
However, there is also a very effective middle ground, which is  
remote offices.  
Many companies have been opening remote offices in cities  
around the world—especially in urban centers with a good supply  
of engineering and design talent—and then working to staff product  
teams in those remote offices, supplemented as necessary with remote  
employees.  
Thismodeltapsintosuppliesoflocaltalent,whilestillproviding  
the benefits of offices.  
Asalways,therearetrade-offs,andtheseremoteofficescanplace  
additionalburdensontheorganization.Itcanbeespeciallydifficultfor  
the managers who provide coaching and oversight.  
Butlet’sdigalittledeeperintothevariousformsofproximity,and  
the specific trade-offs involved in each.  
Proximity to Team Members  
This refers to whether the members of the team are co-located \(they all  
sit physically together\), or fully distributed \(for example, if each team  
memberworksfromhome\),oramix\(forexample,iftheproductman-  
ager, product designer, and tech lead sit together, but the rest of the  
engineers are either working from home or in another office\).  
Especially for teams that depend on true innovation, team  
co-location is a significant advantage. The dynamics of product dis-  
covery depend on intense collaboration—especially between product  
management, product design, and engineering—and while this is not  
impossible when remote, it is harder.  
Iftheengineersareeitherinadifferentofficeorworkingremotely,  
then most of the burden of the additional communication falls on the  
tech lead.  
Proximity to Customers  
If your team is building services for consumers or businesses in India,  
there’s a real advantage to being based in India. That said, we do have  
good tools for connecting remotely with users and customers across Topology and Proximity **231**

languageorculturalissues.So,weareabletoovercomethegeograph-  
ical distance with additional effort, mostly on the part of the product  
manager and product designer.  
Proximity to Business Partners  
If your product team needs to work closely with a particular part of  
your business—such as an operations team, or a customer success  
team—then this is similar to being proximate to customers, and there  
are advantages to being nearby. But again, we can overcome this  
disadvantage with additional effort \(e.g., travel, phone and video calls,  
and increased outreach\), mainly on the product manager and product  
designer.  
Proximity to Managers  
Normally, the managers of product management, product design, and  
engineeringaremanagingtheindividualsonthevariousproductteams,  
and it is usually easier for these managers to review work, observe the  
behaviors, and provide the necessary coaching when their employees  
are local.

needtocollaboratetosolvelarge,complexproblems.Thisiseasierfor  
teams that are physically close to one another, but we can overcome  
the distance issues with additional effort, mainly on the engineers and

uct manager needs to make extra effort to develop and maintain the  
necessaryrelationshipswiththeexecutivesandstakeholders.Theman-  
agers often need to play a larger role in this case.  
# Optimizing for the Product Team  
Hopefully it’s clear that there are trade-offs for each of these dimen-  
sions of proximity. As a general principle, we try to optimize for the  
product team as opposed to optimizing for the managers, or for access  
to customers, or for anything else.  
Herearetwoverycommonsituationswherethistrade-offcomes  
into play.  
Let’s say the choice is between having the product managers and  
designers at the headquarters \(near their managers, the executives,  
andstakeholders\),ortohavetheproductmanagersanddesignersnext  
to their engineers. With the principle of optimizing for the product  
team, we would prefer to co-locate the product managers with their  
engineers.  
Similarly, if the choice is to have the product managers and  
designers located near the customers versus near their engineers, we  
would again try to co-locate with the engineers.

# Topology Evolution  
**M**ost companies already have some sort of existing topology, but  
it had to start somewhere.  
With startups, it usually happens when the number of engineers  
grows beyond 15 or so.  
This is when the company realizes that the empowerment the  
employees had in the early days is now starting to suffer under the  
burden of coordination. They’re also finding it more and more diffi-  
cult to make decisions and to get simple things done. So, they decide  
to form two to three cross-functionalproductteams in orderto divide  
andconquer.Theirdecisionsonhowtodothisestablishthetopology.  
With larger companies that didn’t grow up in the product team  
model, the starting point is usually when they moved to Agile, where  
theywereinstructedtoorganizearoundsmall,durableteams.Howthe  
company decides to divide up the teams establishes the topology.  
Some topologies are established in response to a major change  
of product vision and/or the product architecture. For whatever rea-

# Evolving a Topology  
No matter how empowering your initial topology is, it will not stay  
that way by itself. The realities on the ground are always changing,  
sometimesinwaysthatrequirechangestothetopology.Hereareajust  
a few examples of situations that might call for a change to topology\:  
• A product team that needs to double its engineering resources to  
expand into the next segment of the market  
• Anewstrategythatincludessunsettingaproductcurrentlymain-  
tained by several product teams  
• A new strategy to make some core capabilities from one product  
team available to other teams through an internal platform  
• A new business objective to develop an offering for an expansion  
market  
• A major refactoring of the architecture  
# Topology Warning Signs  
Evenifnoneoftheabovecauseyoutoproactivelyrevisitthetopology,  
good leaders are always checking in with their teams and people and  
shouldbeevaluatingtheirtopologythroughthelensofempowerment.  
Here are a few warning signs that can indicate your topology  
could use some attention\:  
• You are frequently shifting developers between teams  
• You must frequently step in to resolve dependency conflicts  
• Your developers complain of too many dependencies on other  
product teams in order to ship simple things Topology Evolution **235**  
• Teams have very limited scope of ownership  
• Developersmustdealwithtoomuchcomplexityintoomanyareas  
So, whether they are caused proactively or reactively, there are  
situations where we need to revisit the team topology.  
Asmuchaspossible,youshouldtrytokeepyourexistingproduct  
teams intact. Your entire organization has made a big investment in  
establishing relationships to enable good collaboration.  
Thismeansthat,whereverpossible,itisbettertogiveanexisting

are hard on the person moving as they must adjust to a new team and

necessary contribution of engineers as a partner to product manage-  
ment and product design.  
Further, I find that many founders and CEOs are unaware of the  
role they play in the challenges and success of the engineering organ-  
ization. So, education must happen here.  
# Focus and Strategy  
Building and scaling a successful company is really hard, and every  
company has far more work they want to do, than people to do the  
work. So focus is essential, and product strategy is what lets us get the  
most out of the resources and people we have.  
Despite best intentions, upon close examination, often organiza-  
tionsthatarescalingquicklyorcurrentlystrugglinghavenorealfocus  
andnorealproductstrategy.Tryingtodotoomanythingsatoncewill  
damage even the best engineering organizations.  
In many cases, my arrival is the event the company needs to  
reestablish what focus really means. I can’t usually make the choices  
for them, but I can insist that the leaders make the hard choices that  
are necessary.  
# Establish Trust  
People are the heart and soul of any company. And, trust can enable  
those people, working together effectively, to create and achieve far  
more than they ever imagined individually. This is the magic of suc-  
cessful companies.  
Eachorganizationalfunctionhasdistinctexpertiseitbringstothe  
overall company. In the very best product teams, engineering’s unique Leader Profile\: *Debby Meredith* **239**  
value is consistently innovating with technology to deliver winning  
products. For whatever reasons, when an engineering organization is  
not perceived as able to deliver, there will be trust issues. The execu-  
tives don’t trust the engineering organization, and the engineers don’t  
trust the executives.  
Lack of trust causes all kinds of bad behaviors and morale issues,  
on all sides, and usually results in a downward spiral.  
So, it’s essential to have healthy ongoing trust. Reestablishing  
andmaintainingtrustrequireswork—includingfocusandstrategy—at  
everyleveloftheorganization,startingfromthetopbutalsofromthe  
engineers. This leads to the next point.  
# Deliver on Promises  
I need to work with the engineers to understand that when they make  
apromiseorcommitment,itisimportanttheydeliveronthatpromise.  
There are “why,” “when,” and “how” components here that the  
overall organization needs to understand and support. This involves  
coachingtheexecutivestobesmartaboutwhentheyreallyneedadate,  
and coaching the engineers on how to assess the work and take the  
obligation to deliver very seriously.  
There are two aspects to this\:  
First, we need to replaceany unreliableestimation gamesthey’re  
currently playing to try to predict dates with some rigor—thoroughly  
assessingwhat’sinvolvedtogetsomethingworkinganddelivered.This  
can be difficult, often requiring new ways of doing things and almost  
always lots of practice. I’m a big believer in “crawl, walk, run.”  
That may mean building feasibility prototypes, or it may mean  
having some engineers take time to learn or flesh something out.  
Whatever the approach, they need to be able to reasonably predict  
dates—when those dates are truly needed—with high confidence.  
Second, once the engineers have made this commitment, they  
needtotakethiscommitmentveryseriouslyanddeliver.This“dowhat  
yousayyou’regoingtodo”mentalityishopefullytrueforeachperson **240** EMPOWERED  
and team within a company. Regardless, engineering needs to become  
known for following through on its commitments.  
There’s no question that scaling an engineering organization is  
not a trivial undertaking. However, the good news is that there are  
many examples today where this forward motion and successful trans-  
formation have occurred, and organizations are able to deliver with  
pride the products their companies and their customers depend on. **PART**

# Product Strategy  
**241** **242** EMPOWERED  
**U**ltimately, empowered product teams are all about giving teams  
hard problems to solve, and then giving them the space to  
solve them.  
But, how do we decide whichproblems they should solve?  
Answering that question is what product strategy is all about.  
An effective product strategy is absolutely essential to enabling  
ordinary people to create extraordinary products, because it focuses  
and leverages their talents.  
Remarkably, most product organizations I meet don’t even have  
a product strategy.  
Theyhavenoshortageoffeaturesandprojectsbeingworkedon,  
andeverythingtheyarebuildingisbeingbuiltforareason,butasyou’ll  
see, they have no product strategy.  
Ifyou’veneverseenthegreatSouthParkclipontheUnderpants  
Business,1 I’d encourage you to pause for a minute and take a look.  
Seriously, this is really what I see in so many of the companies  
Ivisit.Theyhaveproductteamsthataremoreaccuratelyfeatureteams,  
and they’re slaving away—pounding out features all day—but rarely  
getting closer to their desired outcomes.  
This results in two things\:  
First,thereisadepressingamountofwastedeffort\(primarilydue  
to their dependence on product roadmaps\).  
Second, they are not putting enough concentrated brainpower  
behind the most important problems to achieve the results their com-  
pany needs.  
You may wonder how it is that so many companies don’t have a  
good product strategy—I know I do. Richard Rumelt gives us a hint\:

2Richard Rumelt, GoodStrategy/BadStrategy\(New York\: Crown Business, 2011\). Product Strategy **243**  
So, what even is product strategy, and why is it so important?  
“Strategy”asatermisambiguousasitexistsateverylevelforjust  
about everything—business strategy, go-to-market strategy, growth  
strategy, sales strategy, discovery strategy, delivery strategy, and so on.  
Whatever the goal is, your strategy is how you’re planning to go  
aboutaccomplishingthatgoal.  
Strategy doesn’t cover the details—those are the tactics we’ll use  
to achieve the goal. Strategy is the overall approach and the rationale  
for that approach.  
While there are many forms of strategy, what I care about here  
is product strategy. Which in short means\: How do we make the product  
visionareality,whilemeetingtheneedsofthecompanyaswego?  
So many of the companies I meet have a goal \(such as doubling  
revenue\),andtheyhaveaproductroadmap\(thetactics\),yetnoproduct  
strategyto be found.  
In terms of empowered product teams, product strategyhelps us  
decidewhatproblemstosolve,productdiscoveryhelpsusfigureoutthe  
tacticsthatcanactuallysolvetheproblems,andproductdeliverybuilds  
that solution so we can bring it to market.  
Sowhyisproductstrategysohard?  
Because it requires four things that are not easy for most com-  
panies\:  
1\. The first is to be willing to make tough choices on what’s really  
important.  
2\. The second involves generating, identifying, and leveraging  
insights.  
3\. The third involves converting insights into action.  
4\. And the fourth involves active management without resorting to  
micromanagement.  
Choices means focus. Deciding what few things you really need  
to do, and therefore all the things you won’t do.  
But Ican’t tell youhow manycompaniesI’vegone intothat have  
onanofficewallorspreadsheetalistofliterally50majorobjectivesor  
initiatives they’re pursuing.  
And each product team complains to me that they really have  
no time to pursue their own team’s product work because they have **244** EMPOWERED  
obligations that cover more than 100 percent of their available time,  
not to mention all the “keep-the-lights-on” work and dealing with  
tech debt.  
Moreover, many of these 50 major objectives or initiatives are  
truly hard problems, and just getting a little time slice and no clear  
ownershipfromadozen-or-sodifferentproductteamshasvirtuallyno  
chance of making any real impact.  
So, focus comes from realizing that not everything we do is  
equally important or impactful, and we must choose which objectives  
are truly critical for the business.  
While product strategy starts with focus, it then depends on  
insights.  
And insights come from study and thought.  
These insights come from analyzing the data and from learning  
fromourcustomers.Theinsightsmightpertaintothedynamicsofour  
business, our capabilities, new enabling technologies, the competitive  
landscape, how the market is evolving, or our customers.  
Oncewehavedecidedwhat’scriticallyimportant\(focus\)andstud-  
iedthelandscapetoidentifytheleversandopportunities\(theinsights\),  
then we need to convert those insights into action.  
Inacompanythat’sseriousaboutempoweredproductteams,this  
means deciding which objectives should be pursued by which product  
teams, and then providing those teams with the strategiccontextneces-  
sary for them to solve the problems we need them to solve.  
But we’re not done there because reality is never static or pre-  
dictable.  
As product teams pursue their objectives, some make more  
progress than others, some need help or encounter major obstacles,  
some find they need to collaborate with other teams, some realize  
they’re missing key capabilities, or any of a hundred other possible  
situations.  
Properly managing this activity requires smart, engaged leaders  
practicing servant leadership.

tainly the more difficult.  
In the coming chapters, we’ll dive deeper into each of these ele-  
ments of product strategy—focus, insights, actions, and management.  
But the bottom line is that product strategy requires choice, thinking,  
and effort. **CHAPTER**

# Focus  
The main thing is to keep the main thing, the main thing.  
—Jim Barksdale  
To continue with our series on product strategy, in this chapter  
I focus on, well, focus. The importance of truly picking your battles as  
an organization.  
AndIdon’tjustmeandecidingwhattoworkonandnotworkon,  
but picking the few things that can truly make an impact.  
Thisisanotheroneofthosetopics,likewhetheracompanycares  
abouttheircustomers.InprettymucheverycompanyImeet,thelead-  
ers already believe they are reasonably good at focus.  
But, often, the company’s leaders need a reality check on this  
topic.  
Thesheernumberofthingstheybelievearecriticallyimportant,  
andthatneedtohappenthisquarter,orthisyear,areoftenanorderof  
magnitude too many. I mean that literally. Instead of 2–3 truly impor-  
tant things, they have at least 20–30.  
**246** Focus **247**  
Now, in fairness, I understand why the key leaders believe they  
are reasonably good at focus.  
They have already had countless meetings where they agreed to  
somanythingstheyreallywanttodothisyear,yetwon’tbeableto.So  
from their perspective, they think they already know what it means to  
say no and sacrifice.  
Inlargepart,thisisareflectionofleadersfeelingtheneedtoplace  
alotofbets—versusthebestormostimpactfulbets—thefearofmiss-  
ing out, and the need to respond to every competitor, every lost deal,  
every customer request. These are all understandable reactions.  
But in this case, they need an intervention and a reset on what  
focus really means in a product organization. In my experience, many  
organizations need this intervention.  
Let’s talk about what an organization that doesn’t know how to  
focus on what’s truly important looks like.  
A few years ago, one of the execs of the music service Pandora  
shared the “Pandora Prioritization Process”—the company’s process  
for deciding what to work on and build.1  
Theprocessinvolvedlettingstakeholders“buy”thefeaturesthey  
wanted from the feature teams until their budget ran out.  
I had not worked with them, but when I read this, I immediately  
recognized the complete and utter absence of product strategy and  
especially focus. Not bad product strategy—literally no product strat-  
egy.  
Combinedwiththeirdependenceonfeatureteamsandtheirlack  
ofanysignoftrueproductmanagement,itwasclearthiswouldleadto  
many features built, but little in the way of results or innovation, and  
the company’s inevitable decline.  
And over the next several years, that’s just what we saw. A stock  
thatIPO’din2011at\$16asharekeptsteadilydwindlinguntil,atabout  
\$8 a share, they were finally sold off.2  
For years, I’ve been sharing the Pandora example as a clear case  
study of how not to do product.

.aspx. **248** EMPOWERED  
In most companies it’s not quite so obvious, but so many com-  
panies have some similar sort of stakeholder-driven roadmap process,  
where they basically are trying to find a way to “fairly” divide up the  
engineering capacity across the different business stakeholders.  
This is very much what I mean by feature teams striving to serve  
the business,versusproductteamsstrivingtoservethe customers inways  
that work for the business.  
Thisisanespeciallyclearexampleofthelackofproductstrategy,  
a lack of focus, and more generally, a lack of product leadership.  
To be fair, this way of working is rarely desired by the head of  
product. Rather, it is usually the CEO and stakeholders that want to  
work this way, and the head of product is forced to serve as the facili-  
tator.  
Whatever the reason, this is an example of a company that is pri-  
oritizing but not focusing.  
Stephen Bungay explains\:  
It is easy to generate work with this approach, but not results. As  
Generating activity is not a problem; in fact it is easy. The fact that it is  
easy makes the real problem harder to solve. The problem is getting the  
right things done—the things that matter, the things that will have an  
impact, the things a company is trying to achieve to ensure success.3  
This is one of the most important lessons in leadership, and suc-  
cessful leaders have learned this one way or another.  
EventhoughI\(Marty\)learnedthisearlyinmycareer,thislesson  
was etched in my mind and I’ve found that this principle applies in so  
many aspects of a technology business.  
When I was a new software engineer, working in HP’s applied  
research lab, I was fresh out of college. This meant that I knew some-  
thing about the theory, but very little of the practice.  
The way we worked at the time was using a practice referred  
to today as pair programming, where I was paired with a much more  
experienced engineer and we wrote software “together.” I use the

Results \(London\: Nicholas Brealey, 2010\). Focus **249**  
quotesbecausethetruthisthathe didmostofthewriting,andImostly  
watched and asked questions.  
We were working on fairly low-level systems software, for  
which at the time—and still is the case today with certain types of  
products—performance is key. Systems and applicationswere often so  
slow as to be unusable. So “performanceoptimization” was one of our  
ongoing responsibilities.  
Thegoodnewswasthat,forprettymuchanyareaofcodethatwe  
wouldexamine,itwasnothardtothinkofwaystorefactortoimprove

Hepointedoutthat,whileprettymuchtheentirecodebasecould

In fact, it would not even be enough to be perceived by the user.  
However, there were a few spots where almost all the time was  
going, and if we could improve those few areas, we could make a real  
impact. So that’s where we needed to focus.  
He pointed out that in most organizations, they tell everyone  
that “performance is important,” and so every team works a little on  
performance. But the vast majority of that work makes absolutely no  
difference. And, in the few places where it could make a difference, it  
gets too little concentrated attention.  
Thiswasaverytangibleexampleofthepoweroffocus,butmore  
generallythisisthesituationIseeinsomanycompanieswhenitcomes  
to focus and product strategy.  
By not picking your battles and focusing on the few truly critical  
problems, most of the work going on does not make an impact. And  
forthetrulycriticalpriorities,thereisnotenoughattentiontoactually  
move the needle.  
There is also a very practical reason to focus on just a few truly  
critical problems.  
Most tech product people know about the concept of work in  
progress \(WIP\) limits. It’s an especially common concept in product  
teams using a delivery process such as Kanban. **250** EMPOWERED  
It essentially says that we’ll get more work done \(throughput\) if  
we limit the number of things our product team is working on at any  
onetime.Formostteams,it’safewitems.Ifyoudon’thavetheselimits,  
then work piles up at bottlenecks and we end up constantly switching  
context, and as a result, get fewer things out the door.  
Not a difficult concept, and most product teams see this play out  
on a daily basis.  
However, while this concept is definitely useful at the level of a  
product team, it becomes absolutely critical at the level of the broader  
product organization.  
When an organization has 20, 30, or even 50 “high-priority”  
objectives, initiatives, or projects all going on at once, we have the  
same problem, only much worse.  
First of all, if you have even 20 high-priority initiatives, that is  
likely going to overwhelm your organization. Each team will struggle  
with delivering on those initiatives, versus trying to take care of their  
customers or otherwise pursuing the purpose of their team.  
Second,thereisarealcosttoanorganization,andespeciallytothe  
leadership,foreachhigh-priorityeffortorinitiative.Thiscostinvolves  
management time, decisions, monitoring and tracking, staffing issues,  
and more, and the same concept of WIP limits applies here.  
Thebottomlineisthatanorganizationwillgetmorecriticalwork  
accomplished if it focuses on just a few items at a time.  
So we need to pick our battles based on what really matters, and  
we need to limit the number of major battles we’re trying to pursue  
at once.  
Richard Rumelt reminds us that every good product strategy  
begins with this focus\:  
Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very  
few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of  
favorable outcomes.4  
If the leaders are not willing or able to make these choices, then  
the product strategy is doomed from the start.  
In the next chapter, we’ll consider how we identify and leverage  
insights on these few critical problems we’ve decided to focus on.

# Insights  
**I**n this chapter, I’d like to discuss my favorite, yet the most difficult,  
aspectofproductstrategy,whichistogenerate,identify,andleverage  
the insights that will provide the foundation of the product strategy.  
You’ve probably heard the stories about the insights about  
customer behavior that drove early Netflix to rapid growth and  
profitability, or the insights around new-user onboarding that drove  
early Facebook to explosive growth, or the insights around customer  
trials that Slack and Salesforce.com leveraged to spread like wildfire  
across businesses.  
In this chapter, we explore where these critical insights come  
from, and how to make sure you’re finding them, as they can hide  
among the thousands of other data points you’re likely collecting.  
There are a few things I need to make clear before we get into  
this\:  
First, if you’re looking for some paint-by-number playbook or  
frameworkforcomingupwiththeseinsightsandasolidproductstrat-  
egy, I’ll save you some time and tell you right now you’re not going to  
find that here.  
**251** **252** EMPOWERED  
AsI’vetriedtoemphasizethroughoutthisbook,productstrategy  
requires real effort and thought. Says Richard Rumelt\:  
Goodstrategy… doesnotpopoutofsome“strategicmanagement”tool,  
matrix,chart,triangle,orfill-in-the-blanksscheme.Instead,atalented  
leaderidentifiestheoneortwocriticalissuesinthesituation—thepivot  
pointsthatcanmultiplytheeffectivenessofeffort—andthenfocusesand  
concentratesactionandresourcesonthem.1  
Second, in every single case I know of, including every instance  
whereIwasabletocontributetotheproductstrategymyself,thisnever  
happens without real preparation.  
You might have an epiphany in the shower, but that’s only after  
you’ve spent hours studying your data, your customers, the enabling  
technologies, and your industry.  
The information that’s in the strategic context—the company  
objectives, the company scorecard/dashboard, and the product  
vision—is the foundation for any kind of significant insight. So  
studying this is all part of doing your homework as a product leader.  
Third, it’s important to realize that these insights can come from  
anyone or anywhere. You might find inspiration in an industry analy-  
sis, a chat with a salesperson, a new enabling technology, a seemingly  
random comment from a customer, or an academic paper.  
But without that preparation, you probably won’t recognize the  
insight—even if it’s right in front of you. My main point here is that  
you never know what might help you connect the dots, so always keep  
an eye out and an open mind.  
All that said, there are four consistently effective and valuable  
sources of insights, and strong product leaders spend much of their  
waking hours contemplating these\:

You might have a theory about which customers respond best to

It’s normal today for product teams to be running live-data tests  
on a near-constant basis. You learn something from every test, but  
every once in a while, you learn something truly important—a poten-  
tially valuable insight.  
Thekeyistoknowenoughtospotthislearning,andthenleverage

# Qualitative Insights  
Userresearchisallaboutinsights,whichiswhyI’msuchafanofhaving  
strong user researchers in the organization. Mostly the insights they  
generatearequalitativeandthereforenot“statisticallysignificant,”but  
don’t let that bother you—qualitative insights are often profound and  
can literally change the course of your company.  
Theuserresearchcommunitygenerallybreaksdowninsightsinto  
two types. The first is evaluative, which essentially means, what did  
we learn from testing out this new product idea? Did it work or not,  
and if not, why not? The second type of insights are generative. This  
means, did we uncover any new opportunities that we aren’t pursuing,  
but maybe we should?  
Thisisactuallythesourceofaverycommonconfusioninproduct

We,ofcourse,havelotsofproductideas.Wetestthoseideaswith  
prototypes on actual users, and we can quite quickly learn the major  
reasons why this product idea may or may not work.  
But anytime we interact with users and customers, we have a  
chance to learn more about them, and sometimes we discover even  
bigger opportunities than the ones we’re looking into at the moment.

There is always a great deal to learn from the industry at large. I don’t

insights in other industries that may pertain to your industry, and  
insights from similar markets in other regions of the world.  
There are always some number of analysts covering nearly every  
space, and you should be following those whom you consider to be  
among the best.  
MorethanafewCEOshavedecidedthebestwaytoobtainthese

I admit to mixed feelings about this. The people at these firms  
are often very strong, but they have two big factors working against  
them. First, their focus and experience are almost always on business

at the product team level. **256** EMPOWERED  
But half the battle, especially in larger organizations, is getting  
the relevant insights into the right minds at the right time.  
Itisoftenremarkablehowmuchaproductteamlearns,especially  
as they are working on product discovery for important problems. Yet  
it is easy for that learning to stay just with that product team.  
The insights that are generated need to be shared and commu-  
nicated. Unfortunately, the most common way that most teams try to  
share these learnings is by writing them down somewhere—an email,  
Slack, or a report. Sadly, this is rarely effective.  
The product leader or design leader is often the first person to  
connect the dots between learnings of different teams and see real  
opportunities.  
The key is to make sure these learnings—whether they are com-  
ingfromthedata,customervisits,enablingtechnology,industryanaly-  
sis, or any other source—make it to the product leaders.  
Inmanyways,leadersaregiventhedatatheyrequest,notthedata  
they need—especially to make insightful strategic decisions.  
This is an important benefit of the weekly 1\:1s.  
This is also another example of how empowered product teams  
don’t need lessmanagement, they need bettermanagement.  
These leaders need to take the learnings and pass them along to  
other teams that may benefit from these insights, and more generally,  
help to build their understanding of the holistic business.  
One practice I have long advocated is that the head of product  
should aggregate the key learnings and insights from all the differ-  
ent teams in her areas, and at the weekly or bi-weekly all-hands. She  
should summarize the most important of these learnings and insights,  
and share them with the broader organization.  
This sharing serves a few purposes\:  
First, it helps the broader organization—including the other  
product teams, but also stakeholders—get a better understanding  
of the learning and insights that happen every week in the product  
organization.  
Second, it ensures that the leader is truly grokking all the key  
insights and not just passing along some status in an email.  
Third, it is very hard to anticipate exactly where key insights  
will have the most impact, so it’s very important to share the insights  
broadly, especially across the other product teams. Insights **257**  
One way or another, as a product leader you will need to identify  
insights that you can leverage to generate the necessary impact.  
At this point, we have focused on a small number of truly impor-  
tantproblemsforthebusiness,andwehaveidentifiedwhatwebelieve  
are the linchpins \(the insights\) for moving the needle for those prob-  
lems. Now we’re ready to turn those insights into actions.  
# Vision Pivots  
InthisbookI’velaidthingsoutintheidealandlogicalorder.Westart  
withaninspiringproductvision,wecraftaproductstrategytodeliver  
on that vision, and then the product teams execute on that strategy.  
And in many cases, that’s exactly how I see things play out.  
But it’s important to acknowledge that it’s not always so linear.  
The most common example of this is when, during our work on the  
product strategy, or during a product team’s product discovery work,  
we discover an insight that changes everything.  
We realize that there’s a larger or better opportunity by chang-  
ing course, and after discussion with the senior leaders and usually  
thecompany’sboardtoo,thecompanydecidestochangetheproduct  
vision to leverage this insight.  
This is called a vision pivot, and these vision pivots have both  
saved and created countless companies. Slack, YouTube, Facebook,  
and Netflix are just a few of the companies that experienced this.  
Now I’m always a little hesitant to explain this, because a very  
largeprobleminourindustryhasalwaysbeen,andremains,thatprod-  
uct organizations give up too early on their product vision. As Jeff  
Bezos says, “We need to be stubborn on our product vision,” which I  
very strongly agree with.  
Given empowered product teams with the right skills and  
enough time, we really can deliver on most product visions. The  
vision pivot is most relevant when our insights lead to a larger  
opportunity. Not when we realize that the problems are harder than  
we thought \(which is pretty much always true\). **CHAPTER**  
# 50  
# Actions  
**C**ontinuing with the series on product strategy, in this chapter we  
need to leverage our insights into action.  
At this point, we have focused on a very small number of critic-  
al problems, and we have done the hard work to identify the key  
insights that will power our product strategy. Now we need to turn  
these insights into action, but there are two ways to do this.  
This is the point where there’s a fork in the road, and it’s where  
we can tell if a company is serious about empowered product teams or  
is still addicted to feature teams.  
Ineedtoadmitherethatevenifthecompanychoosestostaywith  
roadmaps and feature teams, they are still far better off if they have a  
strong product strategy. Certainly, much better than the majority of  
organizations with feature teams that have no product strategy.  
The difference really boils down to whether you give your prod-  
uct teams features to build, or problems to solve.  
Most of the time the difference is obvious \(e.g., “Add videos  
to our online help offering” vs. “Improve the new-user onboard-  
ing success rate”\). But sometimes the difference is more nuanced  
**258** Actions **259**  
\(e.g., “We need an app” vs. “Our users need to be able to access our  
services from anywhere”\).  
In the first example, adding videos is just one of probably hun-  
dreds of possible improvements to new-user onboarding.  
In the second example, adding an app is very likely to be the pri-  
marywayofprovidingaccessfromanywhere,sothedifferenceissubtle,  
but there are still multiple ways to achieve the objective, and we want  
to give the team as much latitude as possible to come up with the best  
solution.  
If the leaders believe they know the necessary features and  
projects to execute on the product strategy, then they’ll likely put that  
info on a product roadmap and assign the work to the relevant teams.  
However,iftheleaderswanttheproductteamstofeelownership  
of the problem and take responsibility for discovering and delivering  
a solution that provides the necessary results, then they’ll want to give  
the relevant teams as many degrees of freedom in coming up with an  
effective solution as possible.  
Note that empowering a team does not mean giving the team a  
blankcheck.Therearealwaysconstraintsandcontext—suchasensur-  
ing the solution does not violate an existing contract or compliance  
constraint.  
It’s worth pointing out that the first approach is what we mean  
by a team of mercenaries, and the second is what we mean by a team of  
missionaries.  
Of course, it’s no secret that I am all about the empowered  
team model, as I deeply believe that it generates consistently better  
results—especiallyintermsofinnovationanddeliveringthenecessary  
outcomes.  
In the empowered team model, our intention is to provide the  
teamswiththesetofspecificproblems theyeachneedtosolve,andthen  
givethemthespacetodeterminethebestwaytosolvethoseproblems.  
There are various techniques for managing these problems to  
solve, but the most popular is the OKR system, which stands for  
objectives and key results. The objectives are the customer or business  
problem we need solved, and the key results are how we measure the  
progress. **260** EMPOWERED  
We have already discussed company objectives as a key part of the  
strategic context. But to initiate action, we need to provide the product  
teams with their specific objectives, which are known as team objectives.  
Intheupcomingsectiononteamobjectives\(PartVII\),we’lltalkin  
depthabouthowtoeffectivelyusetheOKR technique intheempowered  
team model.  
But before we talk about the OKR technique, it’s important to  
pointoutthatyoureallydon’tneedthatoranyothertechniqueforthis.  
All that’s really required is for a knowledgeable leader to  
sit down with the relevant product teams, explain the strategic  
context—including the product strategy—and then tell each team  
which problems you need them to work on, and what business results  
they should measure.

TheOKRsystemisatechniqueforformalizingthesediscussions,

uct teams, and the leaders have done their job to create an effective  
product strategy and are ready and willing to entrust their product  
teams to solve the problems we need them to solve.  
In any case, just because you are empowering your teams, this is  
not to imply that we can just leave the teams alone and hope for the  
best. There is still considerable active management required to succeed  
on the product strategy, and that’s what we’ll discuss next. **CHAPTER**  
# 51  
# Management  
**A**t this point, we have focused the organization on a small number  
of truly important problems, we have identified the key insights  
that we will leverage, and we have converted these insights into actions  
in the form of objectives for each product team.  
While this is all necessary preparation for the work that needs to  
be done, I can tell you from experience that, if the leaders stop here,  
you will be disappointed at the end of the quarter.  
This is because no product strategy survives its initial encounter  
with the real world.  
There are any number of issues and obstacles that will emerge,  
andwhileeachproductteamwilldealwiththemandmakemostoftheir  
decisionsforthemselves,therewillbemanycaseswheretheywillneed  
you to remove obstacles and barriers or otherwise provide assistance\:  
• Theproductteamrealizestheymissedadependencyduringtheir  
planning, and now they have a dependency on another team, and  
that team is consumed with its own objectives.  
**261** **262** EMPOWERED  
• During product discovery, the team realizes that they require the  
useofatechnologythattheydonothaveaccessto,orknowledge  
of, today, so they may need to quickly acquire and learn it.  
• Amajorcustomerissuearises,andtheorganizationisscrambling  
to determine the best way to take care of the customer yet still  
make progress on the team objectives.  
• A senior stakeholder raises a major concern impacting one of  
the key objectives, and the product team needs a decision made  
quickly.  
Hopefully, you get the idea. None of this is unusual, but unless  
the leaders are actively engaged in identifying, tracking, and resolving  
these types of obstacles, little progress will result.  
Themainsourceofinformationfortheproductleaderwillbethe  
weekly 1\:1 with the product manager. Of course, if something urgent  
comes up, you want to coach your product managers to reach out to  
you immediately and not wait until the next 1\:1 to discuss.  
During this session, you’ll hear about issues or obstacles, and  
you’ll coach on the best way to handle them. In some cases, you’ll  
need to help by talking to a key stakeholder, or finding an additional  
engineer, or talking to another team about their need to help with a  
problem, or a hundred similar things.  
Please don’t confuse this with command-and-control manage-  
ment. You are not taking over control and telling the teams what to  
do—youarerespondingtotheirrequestsforhelp.It’smoreaccurately  
described as servant leadership and you’re being asked to help remove  
an impediment.  
With all the normal urgencies and interruptions of life in a  
company, it is all too easy to find yourself halfway through the quarter  
with very little progress on the team’s objectives. This is why weekly  
tracking and coaching is so important. You as the manager are ensur-  
ing that the product team is making progress, and also as important  
learnings or insights are discovered, or major issues are identified,  
they are shared with you so this knowledge can be aggregated and  
disseminated to the relevant teams. Management **263**  
The coaching and the management of the strategy are not so  
much different responsibilities as they are two sides of the same dis-  
cussions.  
Once again, with empowered product teams, you don’t need less  
management, you need better management. **CHAPTER**

easy to see her potential.  
Shan-Lyn originally studied market-  
ing and economics, and after getting her  
MBA at Stanford, she joined Yahoo for  
a couple years before she decided to try  
startup life.  
After four years building a product  
team at Gilt, she was ready to found her own startup, Zola, an online

ing for seven years now, and provides services that are loved and  
depended on by engaged couples everywhere.  
Moreover, Zola is considered one of New York’s most promising  
growth-stage companies as well as one of the best tech companies to  
work for.  
# Leadership in Action  
Here’s Shan-Lyn in her own words\:  
There’s nothing that I enjoy more than building things that the  
worldhasneverseenbefore,butoncetheyseethem,they’relike,“How  
did we live without it?” Products that bring genuine joy. That is the  
thing I want to keep doing forever.  
When my co-founder, Nobu Nakaguchi, and I decided to start  
Zola, we did not just have a vision for helping couples with their wed-  
dings, we also had a vision for the kind of company we wanted to  
work at.  
When I was leading product at a prior job, one of the company’s  
leaders gave me the feedback that I was not a good leader because the  
engineers liked me too much. The leader said that if I was doing my  
job properly, the engineers should be complaining about the pressure  
I was putting on them.  
For a little while, I tried changing my approach. But I soon real-  
ized that this was the path to damaging collaboration, breaking trust,  
and likely losing the innovation we depended on.  
Both Nobu and I believed that innovation comes from empow-  
ered teams of strong people working in a trusted environment.  
We deeply believed that we could provide an environment that valued  
and respected the people that worked there, and that this would help **266** EMPOWERED  
us provide the type of experience that engaged couples wanted and  
deserved.  
Manyfounderssaythingslikethis,butwewerewillingtobetthe  
company on this.  
We knew that to succeed with Zola, we would not only need to  
innovateontheproductandexperience,butalsoonourbusinessmodel  
and in how we built and ran our company.  
In our kitchen you’ll find a no assholes sign.  
You’llalsofindsignsemphasizingnopointingfingers,nopolit-  
ics, no games.  
Weknowthatinnovationthrivesinenvironmentswheredifferent

explicit goal from the beginning, for every open role.  
Weofcoursewanteddiversityinskillsandtalents,butalsodiver-  
sityingender,inorientation,ineducation,andinapproachtoproblem  
solving.  
Not only would this help us with innovation, but our  
users—engaged couples—come in every flavor and combination,  
so we believed this would help us at every level.  
We also wanted a culture that valued both collaboration and  
speed.  
While it may seem counterintuitive, we had found that collabo-  
ration early yields not just better results, but faster results.  
So before we make any big decision, we make sure that others  
across the company have been consulted and their views considered.  
We also value getting ideas in front of our customers as fast as  
possible because we know that’s when the real learning happens.  
A few years ago, I was in a serious car accident, and the experi-  
ence made a profound impact on me. I learned to live life more in the  
present. Leader Profile\: *Shan-Lyn Ma* **267**

# Team Objectives  
**269** **270** EMPOWERED  
**I**’ve been a vocal advocate for the OKR \(objectives and key results\)  
techniqueformanyyears,butit’snosecretthat,formostcompanies  
that have given it a try, the results have been disappointing.  
As I see it, there are three fundamental reasons for this.  
# Feature Teams vs. Product Teams  
If the company is still using feature teams, as most unfortunately are,  
thentheOKRtechniqueisgoingtobeaculturalmismatch,andalmost  
certainly prove a waste of time and effort.  
The OKR technique came from companies that had empowered  
product teams in their DNA. OKRs are first and foremost anempow-  
ermenttechnique.  
The main idea is to give product teams real problems to solve,  
and then to give the teams the space to solve them.  
Thisgoesrighttothecoreofenablingordinarypeopletocreateextraor-  
dinaryproducts.  
Yetthetelltalesignofmismatchoutthereisthatcompaniesthink  
they can “check the empowerment box” by giving the team objec-  
tives, yet still continue to tell them the solutions they are supposed to  
deliver—nearlyalwaysintheformofaroadmapoffeaturesandprojects  
with expected release dates.  
# Manager’s Objectives vs. Product Team  
# Objectives  
Thesecondissueisthatthepurposeofacross-functional,empowered  
product team is to work together to solve hard problems.  
Yet, in so many companies, each manager—the manager of  
engineers, the manager of designers, and the manager of product  
managers—creates their own organizational objectives, which are then  
cascaded down to their employees.  
This may sound reasonable, and not necessarily a problem for  
otherpartsofthecompany.Inpractice,however,thismeansthatthese Team Objectives **271**  
employees—when working with their cross-functional colleagues in  
a product team—are all working on their own objectives rather than  
working collaboratively on the teamobjectives.  
To make matters even worse, in many companies there’s an addi-  
tional level of complexity and dilution because they also try to imple-  
ment individual objectives. So not only does the engineer inherit the  
objectivesfromhermanager,butshealsohastoworkonherownper-  
sonal objectives.  
# The Role of Leadership  
Andfinally,andreallytherootoftheproblem,isthatinthevastmajor-  
ityofcompaniesIseethatarestrugglingtogetanyvalueoutofOKRs,  
the role of leadership is largely missing in action.  
They literally think that the idea is to let teams identify a set of  
objectives, and then let them pursue those objectives, and we’ll see  
where we are at the end of the quarter.  
They think that empowered product teams, and this technique  
especially, is about less management. But as I’ve tried to emphasize  
throughout this book, it’s really about bettermanagement.  
It is really any wonder why so many companies get so little value  
from this technique?  
It’snosecretthatmostoftheleadingtechproductcompaniesuse  
the OKR technique or one of the variants. And it’s also no secret how  
much success these companies have had.  
Yet people are confusing correlation with causation.  
Those successful companies aren’t successful because they use  
OKRs. They use OKRs because it is designed to leverage the  
empoweredproductteammodel.  
And as I have tried to make clear in this book, the empowered  
product team model is a fundamentally different approach to building  
and running a tech-product organization.  
You can’t take your old organization based on feature teams,  
roadmaps, and passive managers, then overlay a technique from a  
radicallydifferentcultureandexpectthatwillworkorchangeanything. **272** EMPOWERED  
So, in terms of actually getting the benefits of OKRs, there are  
three critical prerequisites\:  
1\. Move from the feature team model to the empowered product  
team model  
2\. Stop doing manager objectives and individual objectives, and  
instead focus on teamobjectives  
3\. Leadersneedtostepupanddotheirparttoturnproductstrategy  
into action  
The majority of this book has been about the first topic.  
Fortheseconditem,thisismainlyeducation,andhopefullythese  
chapters will set people straight on that.  
It is the third item that needs much more discussion, so in the  
upcoming series of chapters on team objectives, we’ll discuss the role  
of leadership in effective team objectives.  
First, we’ll discuss specifically how we empower teams through  
teamobjectives.Thisisthemostimportantbenefitofteamobjectives,  
and yet it is often the least understood.  
Ultimately,thepointofteamobjectivesistoexecuteonourprod-  
uct strategy, and this is where we convert our strategy into action. We  
need to discuss how work is assignedto product teams in ways that are  
both empowering yet also accountable.  
Next,we’lldiscusshowleadersmanageaportfolioofriskbyshar-  
ingwithteamshowambitioustheywouldlikethemtobeastheypursue  
the problems they’ve been asked to solve.  
It’s critical to note that sometimes it’s not about the level of  
ambition, but rather, we need to occasionally make what’s called a  
high-integritycommitment and we need to discuss how these are made  
and managed.  
Oneofthecommonmisconceptionsaboutteamobjectivesisthat  
only a single product team should work on a specific problem. On the  
contrary, much of our best work requires collaborationbetween teams,  
and there are several important forms of collaboration we’ll discuss.  
As with any difficult technology-based endeavor, we need  
to actively manage this work, always being mindful to manage by Team Objectives **273**  
coaching and servant leadership, and not to regress to command-and-  
control-style management—undermining the benefits of empower-  
ment.  
Along with empowerment comes accountability, and we need to  
discuss what this means in practice.  
Finally, we’ll put all this in perspective with the most important  
points to getting the real value out of team objectives. **CHAPTER**  
# 53  
# Empowerment  
**N**ow that we know what actions we need each product team to  
pursue,weneedtodiscusshowweassignthisworkinsuchaway  
as to empower the team.  
The essential point of team objectives is to empower a team by\:  
\(a\) giving them a problem to solve rather than a feature to build, and \(b\)  
ensuringtheyhavethenecessarystrategic context tounderstandthewhy  
and make good decisions.  
Themostimportantpointtounderstandaboutteamobjectivesis  
that,firstandforemost,theyareintendedtogivetheproductteamthe  
space to come up with solutions to hard and important problems.  
This is in stark contrast to a typical product roadmap, which  
provides the team with a prioritized list of features and projects  
to build. If those features or projects do not solve the underlying  
problems, then we fail, even though we may have delivered what we  
were asked to build.  
**274** Empowerment **275**  
# Assigning Problems to Solve, Rather Than  
# Features to Build  
Some people believe that the difference is not such a big deal. If you  
think you need your team to build an app, then just tell them to build  
the app rather than providing them the business and strategic context  
and letting them figure out we need to build an app.  
Butoneofthemajorlessonsourindustryhaslearnedisthis\:How  
work is assigned matters.  
Therearemanyreasonswhythisispreferred,butthemostimpor-  
tant are\:  
• The best people to determine the most appropriate solution are  
thoseclosesttotheproblem,withthenecessaryskills—theproduct  
team.  
• Wewanttheteamtotakeresponsibilityforachievingthedesired  
outcome.  
• If we tell the team the feature we want them to build, then if that  
feature doesn’t provide the necessary results, we can’t hold the  
team accountable.  
• Ifwegivetheteamtheproblemtosolve,andthespacetosolveit

ownership of the problem.  
• If the first solution the team comes up with does not produce the  
desired outcome, they know they must continue to iterate and/or  
try alternative approaches until they find a solution that does.  
Soteamobjectivesarecomprisedofanobjective\(theproblemthat  
needs to be solved\) and some measures of progress \(the key results\).  
Let’s discuss each.  
NotethatIampresentingthesehereinOKRformat,butwhatis  
importantis\(1\)theirfocusonasmallnumberofmeaningfulobjectives,  
and \(2\) they are measuring the results based on business results, not  
output or activities. **276** EMPOWERED  
# Objectives  
Thespecificobjectiveswill,ofcourse,beafunctionofthetypeofprod-  
uct and the responsibilities of the particular product team, but typical  
examples of good objectives are\:  
• Reduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address  
• Increase the percentage of shipments delivered with next-day  
delivery  
• Reduce the percentage of images flagged as inappropriate  
• Reduce the subscriber churn rate  
• Demonstrate product/market fit for an existing product in a new  
market  
• Decrease the time it takes a job seeker to find a new job  
• Reduce the operational costs of fulfillment  
• Reduce the cost to acquire a new customer  
• Increase the lifetime value of the customer  
• Reducethepercentageofcustomersthatrequirecustomerservice  
assistance  
• Reduce the average time spent handling a customer service call  
• Increasethepercentageofnewcustomersthatsuccessfullycreate  
an account  
• Reduce the time for a user to produce their first monthly report  
• Reduce the time required to deploy a new or updated service to  
production  
• Improve the site availability  
Remember not to get too attached to the specific wording of the  
objective.Often,onceaproductteamunderstandsthestrategiccontext  
and has had a chance to investigate the objective, they find that it may  
make more sense to rephrase, or change the emphasis, or generalize  
the objective. This back and forth between the leader and the product  
team is both normal and healthy.  
What’smostimportantaboutalloftheseexamplesisthattheyare  
problems to solve and not features to build. Empowerment **277**  
Some are customer problems, and some are business problems, but  
in each case, there are any number of potential solutions. The point is  
thattheproductteamisbestsuitedtodeterminethemostappropriate  
solution.  
Notice also the example objectives are all qualitative. The quan-  
titative dimension will be discussed in the key results.  
It’s also important to acknowledge here that many of the most  
important objectives will require the product team to either collabor-  
ate with other product teams or, in many cases, to collaborate with  
different parts of the organization to achieve the goal.  
Thatisnotonlyokay,butverymuchintended,althoughinprac-  
tice this depends on having a product manager on the product team  
who has a deep understanding of the business.  
# Key Results  
Whiletheobjectiveis theproblemto solve,the keyresultstell us how  
we define success.  
Andit’sessentialthatwedefinesuccessbybusiness results \(akaout-  
come\) and not simply activity or output.  
Thesecondmostcommonreasonthatteamsgowrongwithteam  
objectives is that they end up listing activities or deliverables as their  
keyresults.Hopefully,atthispointitiscleartoyouthatoutputwould  
miss the point. But, just in case it’s not, the reason this is so much of  
a problem is that it is very easy to ship a deliverable yet not solve the  
underlyingproblem.Inwhichcase,we’rebacktothesameoldproblem  
we have with product roadmaps.  
Generally speaking, we want between two and four key results  
for each objective. The first key result is normally the primary  
measure. Then we have one or more key results as a measure of  
quality—sometimes called guardrail or backstop key results—to ensure  
that the primary key result is not inadvertently achieved by hurting  
something else.  
For example, suppose we consider the objective of\:  
• Reduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address  
Now,theprimarykeyresultwouldlikelybetheactualpercentage  
ofincorrectdeliveries.Butifweweretoachievethatbyburdeningthe **278** EMPOWERED  
orderingandfulfillmentprocess,it’spossibletoreducethepercentage,  
but also significantly reduce the absolute number of deliveries, or sig-  
nificantly increase the cost of delivery, neither of which would be a  
helpful solution. So, potential key results could be measured by\:  
• Reduce percentage of incorrect deliveries  
• While ensuring that total deliveries continue to grow  
• While ensuring the cost of delivery does not grow  
Notice that, while these key results do imply specific KPIs, we  
don’t yet have the expected values or timeframes because those will  
need to come from the team.  
The reason for that is because, if we were to provide to the team  
explicit measures of success including timeframe, they won’t feel that  
ownership over the commitment that we want in an empowered team.  
So the actual quantitative values need to come from the teams.  
It’s also important to note that sometimes the most appropriate  
measure of success or KPI is not yet clear, especially in the case where  
it’s a problem we haven’t worked on before. In this case, the team may  
needsometimetobetterunderstandthedynamicsandthemostappro-  
priate measures.  
The higher-order point here is that the best team objective will  
come from a back-and-forth dialog between the leader and the team.  
As teams investigate and consider, they often find new and better  
approaches that may suggest different key results, or even a modified  
objective. Moreover, it’s the leader’s job to ensure that this back and  
forth is happening. As a leader, you don’t want a passive team—if the  
team is not actively engaged and debating, be sure to explicitly ask  
them what they think and why.  
A related issue is to be sure the team does not “let the tail wag  
the dog.” What that means is that sometimes a team will be tempted  
to define their key results by something that is easy to measure rather  
than what’s most meaningful to measure. Empowerment **279**  
# Sharing Strategic Context  
If we are to give product teams the space to solve hard problems, we  
mustalsoprovidetheseteamswiththecontextnecessarytomakegood  
decisions.  
We need to share the strategic context—especially the product  
vision and product strategy—with the product teams for four main  
reasons\:  
First, it’s critical that the team have a deep understanding of the  
ultimate goal and why this is an important problem to solve.  
Second,wewantteamstostartthinkingthroughtheinsights,and  
considering how they each might be able to contribute to solving the  
key problems.  
Third, we want the teams to start thinking through the implica-  
tions of the upcoming work. Perhaps there are dependencies that are  
not immediately visible. Or technologies or skills that we will need to  
acquire.  
Fourth, we love it when teams express a special interest in work-  
ing on specific problems. We can’t always accommodate every team  
working on the problems they request, but we are certainly motivated  
to try.  
With these principles in mind, we’re now ready to assign objec-  
tives to specific product teams. **CHAPTER**

# Assignment  
**K**eeping in mind the principles of empowerment that team  
objectives are designed to encourage, we are ready to have the  
productteamsgettowork.So,let’sconsiderthemechanicsofassigning  
objectives to product teams.  
# Assigning Objectives to Product Teams  
To be very clear, and to address head-on another one of the very com-  
mon misconceptions about team objectives, it is the responsibility of the  
leaders to decide which problems should be worked on by which product teams.  
Many companies think that the idea is to let the product teams  
comeupwiththeirownobjectives,yetaresomehowsurprisedwhenthe  
organization complains of lack of direction and little is accomplished.  
Andit’simportanttopointoutthatthisisnotthefaultoftheteams—it’s  
the clear fault of leadership.  
Moreexplicitly,thewholepointofassigningobjectivestoproduct  
teams is to execute on a product strategy. The product strategy is all  
about deciding which problems to work on.  
**280** Assignment **281**  
Assigning objectives to product teams is both a top-down and  
bottom-up process, and it often requires iteration.  
These assignments are a function of the product strategy and the  
teamtopology\(akateamscoping\).Inotherwords,thestrategytellsus  
which problems we need to solve, and the topology will imply which  
teams are best positioned to tackle each problem.  
Now,weloveitwhenteamsvolunteertopursueanobjective,and  
we try hard to accommodate that desire, but we also are clear with  
the teams that we can’t always accommodate them because we have to  
ensurethat,in aggregate, the organization is covering as much of the overall  
organizational objectives as possible.  
So,eventhoughateammaywishtopursueaspecificobjective,it  
is up to the leaders to decide this.  
Hopefully this is understood, but this is not a power thing or a  
control thing—this is just about the managers doing their job. Some-  
onehastolookholisticallyatalltheteamsandthefullsetofobjectives.  
# Determining Key Results  
Once a team is asked to pursue an objective, the first thing they need  
to do is consider what the appropriate key results should be, and what  
they believe they can accomplish.  
If the team has worked in this area before, they probably already  
have a reasonable sense.  
However, if it’s the first time they have worked on this problem,  
thentheywilllikelyneedsometimetolearnthespace,startcollecting  
some data to establish a baseline, and get a sense of what the possi-  
bilities are. In this case, encourage the team to jump in and not get  
stuckinparalysisbyanalysis,andacknowledgewiththemthattheywill  
learnmuchmoreastheyprogress,andthattheconfidencelevelwill,of  
course, be low in this first quarter because they are still learning what  
they don’t know.  
The team will also need guidance from leadership on how ambi-  
tious orconservativetheyshouldbeinpursuingsolutions.Moreonthis  
topic in the next chapter, but for now, let’s just say that it’s important  
that the leaders provide the team with some guidance on how aggres-  
sive they would like the team to be in pursuing solutions. **282** EMPOWERED  
Butsupposetheteamisaskedtopursuetwoobjectives,andman-  
agementconsiderstheresultstheyproposetoachievetobeinsufficient  
to achieve the necessary business results over the year. What then?  
In this case, the leaders might ask the team to instead pursue just  
a single objective rather than two, or they might ask another team to  
collaborate with them on one of the problems.

# Alignment  
Oncetheleadershaveworkedwiththeproductteamstodecidewhich  
product teams will pursue which problems, they then need to ensure  
that the product teams and the broader organization are aligned.  
For example, let’s say we’re working to bring to market a signifi-  
cant new offering to meet the needs of a new type of customer.  
We need to ensure that any necessary platform team efforts are  
aligned to do the work necessary to support the experience product  
teams.  
Similarly, we need to ensure the sales and marketing efforts are  
appropriately aligned.  
Ifthesalesandmarketingteamswerepursuingadifferentmarket,  
or not preparing for the new market, that would be an example of not  
being in alignment.

consumes the team, in which case the leaders will need to potentially  
growtheteam,orelsenotexpectanythingbeyondthisoverheadwork,  
or they can look into ways of reducing this overhead burden.  
In the next chapter, we’ll discuss one of the most important  
dimensions to a team objective, which is how ambitious the team  
should be in pursuing solutions.  
# Longer-Term Objectives  
It’s important to realize and acknowledge that, if you have a strong  
product strategy—based on focus and insights—and the product  
teams are working on important customer and business problems,  
where the work is hard but would cause meaningful impact, then in  
many cases the objectives will span multiple quarters.  
Yet this often causes confusion.  
First, it’s important to distinguish long-term objectives from  
long-term key results.  
Havinganobjective thatlastsformultiplequartersisnottheleast  
bit unusual or problematic.  
Good examples might be re-platforming work—which is usu-  
ally on the order of one to three years of work—or major product  
challenges such as reducing customer churn or establishing product/  
market fit.  
Wherethingsgetharderiswiththekey results.Now,itwouldbe

Thenormalandpreferredwaywehandlethisistobreakupthe

Here’s an example\: Let’s say the goal is to get six referenceable  
customers on the path to product/market fit. That’s a very powerful  
business result, and it’s one of our best leading indicators of future

# Ambition  
**W**e have now assigned each product team one or more specific  
problems to solve, but we’re not quite done providing the  
necessary context.  
Whenleadersaskateamtoworkonsolvingaproblem,it’simpor-  
tant to be clear with the team about the level of ambition they should  
strive for in their discovery work.  
Should the team focus on low-risk but low-reward “sure things,”  
orshouldtheystriveformoresubstantialanddramaticimprovements?  
One useful way to think about team objectives is that the leaders  
are placing a series of bets. Some are low risk, some are high risk, and  
some are in between.  
They’re making bets primarily on the people, but also on new  
enabling technologies, changing market conditions and customer  
behaviors,andthestrengthoftheinsightsbehindtheproductstrategy.  
As you’ll see, if something is important enough, the leaders  
mightchoosetohaveseveralteamseachattackaproblemintheirown  
way—some going for low-risk, quick wins, and others maybe going  
for much more ambitious but higher-risk approaches.  
**285** **286** EMPOWERED  
It’s important not to confuse the level of ambition with the level  
of effort or sense of urgency.  
Work ethic and sense of urgency are more a function of the  
culture—and also very likely your company’s cash situation—and not  
what we are addressing here.  
Teams that pursue low-risk/low-reward solutions will test prod-  
uct ideas that are much different from teams pursuing high-risk/  
high-reward solutions. The nature of the product discovery work will  
bedifferent,andthetechniquestheyusewilllikelybedifferentaswell.  
It’s also important not to confuse the level of ambition with a  
high-integrity commitment \(which we’ll discuss next\). In this case, they  
arerelated,butacommitmentisaspecialandcriticallyimportantcon-  
cept in its own right.  
This is really all about risk management. If you have a very diffi-  
cult and critically important problem—such as a churn rate that is too  
hightosustainabusiness—thenexperiencedleaderswillwanttoattack  
that problem from different angles and different levels of risk. They  
may have a couple of teams pursuing low-lying fruit, but they’re wor-  
riedthatwon’tbeenough.Sothey’llalsohaveacoupleteamspursuing  
much more ambitious approaches to the problem.  
Some people like to refer to level of ambition as either a roof shot  
or a moon shot.  
A roof shot refers to a team being asked to be conservative and  
pursuelower-risk,butalsohighlylikely,tangibleresults.Optimization  
work fits well here.  
On the other hand, a moon shot is when the team is asked to be  
very ambitious, such as going for a 10X improvement. It is expected  
thatthisishighrisk,butwealsobelievethatit’snotimpossibleandthe  
team is well-positioned to make a serious attempt. Yes, it’s high risk,  
but it’s also potentially high reward.  
The point of a moon shot is to encourage the team to think  
beyond the small and safe optimizations, and revisit how the problem  
is solved today in the hopes of breaking through.  
And still other companies prefer to attach a degree of confidence  
to the objective, such as 80 percent likely to achieve a roof shot versus  
20 percent likely to achieve a moon shot. Ambition **287**  
These techniques are useful for communicating the desired level  
ofambitiontotheteams.Butrealizethat,intermsofmanagingaport-  
folioofrisk,therecanandshouldbeanylevelofambitioninbetween.  
Imagine a professional poker player in Las Vegas being told she  
could only place bets of \$1 or \$10,000. That would seriously hinder  
herabilitytoworkbecauseshewouldratherbeabletoplacearangeof  
bets in various amounts based on the circumstances.  
The point is that the leaders are essentially managing a portfolio  
ofpotentialriskandreward.Theymayhavecertainteamsthataremore  
ambitious than others, even for the same objective.  
Whatever the level of ambition associated with your key  
results, be sure to clearly communicate this across the organization.  
You especially don’t want anyone to assume that something is a  
very-high-confidence result when it’s not. **CHAPTER**  
# 56  
# Commitments  
**W**hile most objectives are meant to be aspirational, where  
we aren’t sure which will succeed and to what degree, and  
we can vary the degree of ambition the team strives for, there are  
always certain cases where we need the team to make what is called a  
high-integrity commitment.  
# High-Integrity Commitments  
Few people like what I’m about to say, but if you haven’t learned this  
yet about the commercial product world, it’s time you do\:  
In all businesses there are occasional situations where something  
important must be delivered by a specific deadline date.  
The deadline might be a major industry trade show–driven date,  
or it might be a partner-driven date due to a contract, or a calendar-  
drivendateduetotaxdaysortheholidayperiod,oramarketing-driven  
date due to a purchased advertising campaign.  
**288** Commitments **289**  
Realize that one of the main reasons leaders gravitate toward  
the command-and-control model of management—especially with  
old-style roadmaps of features and projects delivered on dates—is  
precisely because of this need to know when important things are  
going to happen.  
So a key condition to moving to empowered teams is that the  
teams be able to provide dates and deliverables when necessary—not  
just the low-integrity dates of the roadmap era \(because we really had  
verylittleunderstandingofwhatwasbeingcommittedto\),butdates the  
leaders can count on.  
Ifyou’reusedtoconventional-styleAgileprocesses,youprobably  
know that coming up with a high-confidence date is very difficult if  
notimpossible.However,ifyou’reusedtothemodelofdoingproduct  
discoveryinparallelwithproductdelivery,thenyouknowthatcoming  
up with a high-confidence date is not hard, so long as the company  
is willing to wait until the necessary product discovery work has been  
done before the date is provided \(usually a few days\).  
Now, if a company has too many of these date-driven commit-  
ments, it is usually a sign of more serious issues, but I always try to  
explain to product teams that some amount of high-integrity commit-  
ments is necessary when trying to run a business.  
Evenifyoudon’t havethese externalcommitments, therewillbe  
cases where you depend on other product teams. An example is when  
you depend on a new capability from a platform team.  
Now, most of the minor dependencies on changes from a plat-  
formteamwillbeconsidered“keep-the-lights-on”work,butoccasion-  
ally something more significant is required, and we’ll treat that as a  
high-integrity commitment.  
Remember that, just as a product team does not need all of their  
work to be an OKR, not all dependencies need to be a high-integrity  
commitment. The vast major of dependencies are not.  
High-integrity commitments are intended for situations where  
you have an important external commitment or a very important and  
substantial internal commitment. **290** EMPOWERED  
# Deliverables  
Inthesecases,weneedtoknowwithveryhighconfidenceifateamcan  
deliver on this promise.  
In the event your product team is asked to make a high-integrity  
commitment, you will need to investigate the commitment. This typ-  
ically involves doing sufficient product discovery on the item so that  
your product team \(especially the product manager, product designer,  
and tech lead\) can determine whether the solution will be valuable,  
usable, feasible, and viable.  
This often involves creating a quick prototype, such as a feasi-  
bility prototype, to ensure the engineers understand the scope of the  
necessary work to produce the necessary deliverable.  
Oncetheproductteambelievestheyunderstandthesolutionsuf-  
ficiently, they can estimate with high confidence how long it will take  
for them to deliver on this commitment \(feasibility\), and also whether  
thatsolutionwillworkforthecustomer\(valueandusability\)andwork  
for your company \(viability\).

fromaplatformteam—wherethatplatformteammayneedtoprovide  
an API or a new servicethat the experienceteam will buildupon—the  
platformteamcaninheritfromtheexperienceteamtheirobjectiveand  
key results.  
Most important, for high-integrity commitments, the actual  
deliverable that is the commitment needs to be noted and tracked  
independently of the key results.  
# Tracking High-Integrity Commitments  
High-integrity commitments are given special treatment. We do not  
talkintermsofhowambitioustheteamneedstobe.Thesearebinary.  
The team either delivers what they promised or not. And a team that  
makes a high-integrity commitment is absolutely expected to deliver,  
or at the first sign of trouble, they need to raise the flag early and ask  
for help. Commitments **291**  
Further, we normally track these high-integrity commitments  
explicitly.Insomecompanies,theCTOmustpersonallyagreetoeach  
high-integrity commitment because it is her reputation on the line.  
As I’ve said many times in this book, empowered product teams  
arepredicatedontrust,andhigh-integritycommitmentsareoneofthe  
importantwaysthatproductteamsbuildtrustwithleadership.Sowhen  
you are asked to come up with a high-integrity commitment date, it is  
essential that you and your team be sure you can and will deliver on  
this commitment.  
Onefinalnoteofwarning\:high-integritycommitmentsanddeliv-  
erables should be the exception and not the rule. Otherwise, it is a  
slippery slope and pretty soon your objectives become nothing more  
than a list of deliverables and dates, which is little more than a refor-  
matted roadmap. **CHAPTER**

# Collaboration  
**T**hereareseveralformsofcollaborationthatareessential,yetoften  
confusing to product organizations as they work to optimize for  
team autonomy and empowerment. Let’s consider two specific kinds  
of collaboration\: shared team objectives and common objectives.  
# Shared Team Objectives  
Thefirstandmostbasicformofcollaborationistheconceptofashared  
team objective—whenmultipleteamssharethesameteamobjective.For  
an important objective, this is not at all unusual.  
This is especially common in the case of large, company initia-  
tives, which are essentially problems large enough that they require  
help from many product teams.  
Themoststraightforwardexampleofthisiswhenbothanexperi-  
enceproductteamandaplatformteamhavethesameobjectivebecause  
the platform team is expected to need to provide one or more new  
services to enable the experience product team.  
**292** Collaboration **293**  
Inthiscase,theteamswillnormallycollaboratetoestablishasim-  
ple form of contract with each other in the form of an API, and then  
both proceed to figure out their sides, and then they will again collab-  
orate on testing and delivery.  
Another form of shared team objective is when multiple teams  
temporarily combine their talents to solve a particularly hard prob-  
lem.Especiallyonproblemsthatbenefitfromarangeofdifferentskills  
brought to bear, bringing the teams together can often provide the  
knowledge and synergy required to quickly come up with an effective  
solution.  
In certain situations, the teams will co-locate for a few days or  
a week in what is sometimes called a “swarm,” which is an intense,  
highly collaborativetechnique to dive deep together on either or both  
discovery and delivery work for a particularly challenging problem.  
# Common Objectives  
Another form of collaboration is a common objective—when multiple  
teamsareaskedtopursuethesameproblem,buteachintheirownway.  
The reason for this is really risk management. We have a solid  
productstrategybuiltonfocusandinsights,butwestillneedtoexecute  
on this strategy, and sometimes that involves solving some very hard  
problems.  
If the problem is especially difficult, then we know that it can be  
hardtoknowwhichapproach,ifany,willproducethenecessaryresults.  
In this case, we may ask multiple teams to pursue the same prob-  
lem and hope that at least one of those teams will be able to generate  
the necessary impact. It would be even better, of course, if all of them  
made a significant impact, but we know that’s highly unlikely.  
A good example of this might be when one of the focus areas is  
subscriber churn, where too many of our customers are leaving the  
service.Thereare,ofcourse,manywaysthisproblemcanbeaddressed,  
and having multiple teams address this from multiple angles is often a  
good way to mitigate the risk.1

# Management  
**C**ontinuing our series on team objectives, once product teams have  
theirteamobjectivesforthequarterandarepursuingthem,active  
management will still be needed.  
Much as the product strategy requires ongoing tracking and  
managing by the product leaders, the team objectives require ongoing  
tracking and managing by the product team.  
# Keep-the-Lights-On Work  
Remember that the team objectives are not the only work that a  
productteamisresponsiblefor.Wealsohavethe“keep-the-lights-on”  
work we discussed earlier. We do need to keep an eye on this ongoing  
work because, if it spikes, the team won’t be able to make much  
progress on their team objectives.  
**295** **296** EMPOWERED  
# Weekly Tracking  
The key is to make sure the product teams are actively managing  
progress on the team objectives, otherwise it is all too possible that  
weeks and then months will fly by with little progress.  
At a minimum, product teams stay on top of progress by dis-  
cussing at weekly check-ins where they are, what is upcoming, and  
where they might need help. These weekly team objective check-ins  
are the key mechanism that teams use to track and manage their own  
progress.  
This check-in might happen in its own meeting, or it might get  
included with a standup once a week.  
Occasionally,theteamswillraiseanissuethatrequirestheleaders  
to coordinate to resolve conflicts or issues.  
# Staying on Track  
In terms of handling issues that arise, there are two key points\:  
First,theproductmanagerspecificallyneedstocommunicateany  
important issues with her manager, so that the manager can have the  
chance to provide assistance where possible.  
Second,it’scriticalthateachmemberoftheproductteamgetthe  
ongoingcoachingsheneedstodevelop.Andsomeofthatcoachingwill  
pertain to the team objective-related issues she faces.  
Forproductteamsthatarenotyetexperienced,themanagerswill  
need to be more proactive in their questions and coaching to ensure  
that the teams are making progress on their team objectives.  
If the team needs the assistance of management, then the sooner  
this need is raised the better chance management has of helping in a  
timely and effective manner.  
It’s also an important obligation to alert management as early as  
possible in the event that there is a question as to the team’s ability to  
deliver on a high-integrity commitment. Management **297**  
Similarly, if there is a dependency—such as on another product  
team—thisdependencywillneedtobemanagedandtrackedcarefully.  
If they are a dependency for another team—whether this is a high-  
integrity commitment the team made, or just normal keep-the-lights-  
onwork—thentheywillneedtokeepthisinmindandensurethiswork  
is completed in time for the team that depends on them.  
# Helping Our Colleagues  
While so much of empowered product teams is about optimizing for  
the product teams, it’s also important to recognize that we will often  
need to help out our colleagues on other product teams, and we very  
likely have situations where we will depend on them helping us out  
as well.  
The best product teams know that, when it comes to tech com-  
panies,weeitherall succeed,ornone ofussucceed.Andit’snotunusual  
to find yourself in the situation where you believe you must do some-  
thing that’s not in the best interest of your product team, but you see  
that it is in the best interest of the customer and of the broader orga-  
nization. **CHAPTER**  
# 59  
# Accountability  
**T**he companion to empowerment is accountability.  
Product teams are given the space and time to come up with the  
solutions to the problems they are assigned, but with that empower-  
ment comes responsibility and accountability.  
So, what happens when a team fails to deliver on one or more of  
their team objectives?  
The first thing to keep in mind is that accountability is directly  
related to ambition. If the team was asked to be very ambitious \(e.g.,  
a moon shot\) and the attempts failed to generate the desired results,  
then that is largely expected.  
However, if the team was asked to be conservative \(e.g., a  
roof shot\), or even more important, if they were asked to make a  
high-integrity commitment and they failed to deliver in this situation,  
then this is where accountability comes into play.  
Each product team, as well as the organization as a whole, needs  
to continue to grow and improve. These cases can provide excellent  
learning opportunities.  
**298** Accountability **299**

Theseteam objective postmortems arenotfunfortheteam,butthey  
are typically very constructive and helpful. Is there some embarrass-  
ment at admitting your failures to your peers? Sometimes. But that’s  
part of the feedback we all need to continue to learn and grow.  
# Attribution of Key Results  
It is not in the least unusual to have multiple teams working on the  
same problems to solve \(objectives\), and/or sharing one or more  
measures of success \(key results\). In fact, that can be a very powerful  
strategy.  
But you may be wondering in this case, how would we hold  
teams accountable to results if many things are changing every day,  
andwedon’tknowwhichchangesbywhichteamsarehelping,which  
are hurting, and which make no difference?  
This is known as the product attribution problem, and in general,  
there are two common ways of answering this.  
The first, which depends on strong levels of traffic, is with an  
A/Btest.Thisisolatesthecontributionofjustoneteam’schangesfrom  
everything else going on in other teams or from elsewhere across the  
company \(e.g., marketing programs\).  
\(continued\) **300** EMPOWERED  
\(continued\)  
The second, which involves dividing up the various contribu-  
tions to the relevant key result by channel or source, is referred to as  
slicing.

Forexample,supposewehavethreedifferentproductteamsina

applications. We could slice the number of job applications between  
the different channels\:  
• Mobile team\: Applications from mobile notifications  
• Search team\: Applications from search results  
• Recommendations team\: Applications from recommendations  
Slicing is simpler conceptually than running A/B tests, and  
teams often like the feeling of control over a more narrowly defined  
target that is more directly within their influence, although it is not  
usually as rigorous or predictive. For example, the same user often  
interacts with more than one channel.  
Slicing is not always possible, as sometimes there are several  
contributingfactorsatplay\(forexample,manyfactorsinfluencesub-

# Objectives in  
# Perspective  
**W**e need some way to manage and assign work to product teams,  
andwewanttodothisinawaythatisempoweringandexecutes  
on our product strategy. This is the purpose of team objectives.  
Assuming you have embraced the empowered product team  
model, and you have capable leaders \(admittedly, these are two big  
assumptions\), it is fairly straightforward.  
Herearethe10mostimportantkeystoeffectiveteamobjectives\:  
1\. The most important thing is to empower teams by assigning  
them problems to solve and then give the teams the space to solve  
them.Forthemtomakegooddecisions,theywillalsoneedyou  
to share the strategic context, especially the product strategy.  
2\. We love it when product teams volunteer to work on specific  
objectives, and we try to accommodate this when possible to  
**301** **302** EMPOWERED  
leverage their motivation and enthusiasm for the problem. But  
we can’t always do so because we need to make sure we cover  
everything we need to.  
3\. Selecting the objectives to be worked on, and ultimately decid-  
ing which team or teams works on each objective, is the explicit  
responsibility of product leadership. However—and this is critically  
important for empowerment—the key results need to come from  
the team.  
4\. It’s normal that there’s a back and forth—not that the leaders  
doubt or question what the teams propose as their key results,  
but rather judging which investments are worth the effort and  
associated risk. For example, suppose a team believes that,  
with their other objectives, they can only make a very minimal  
improvement to a specific, important KPI. The leaders might  
considerhavingthatteamfocusexclusivelyontheoneobjective  
ordecidetoaskadifferentteamtopursueitorhelpinsomeway.  
5\. There is nothing wrong with assigning the same objective to  
multiple teams—each team tackling the problem from its own  
perspectiveandskills.Infact,fordifficultproductproblems,this  
isoftenaveryeffectivetechnique.Onhardproblems,weexpect  
that not all teams will make the same level of progress, and we  
can’t anticipate in advance what the teams will learn when they  
each get deep into their product discovery work.  
6\. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with asking multiple teams to  
collaborate on the same team objective. It’s not unusual to ask  
multiple teams to work together—especially when the problem  
requires different sets of skills. A common situation is asking a  
platform team and an experience team to collaborate on a diffi-  
cult problem.  
7\. Forproductteamstocomeupwithkeyresults,it’sessentialthat  
they understand the level of ambition you want from them. We  
needtobeclearwithteamswhenwewantthemtobeveryambi-  
tious \(aka moon shot\), when we want them to be conservative  
\(aka roof shot\), and when we need them to make a high-integrity  
commitment. Objectives in Perspective **303**  
8\. Product teams can only be accountable to the results if they are  
empoweredtofigureoutasolutionthatworksandiftheyarethe  
ones to come up with the key results.  
9\. The product leaders have to realize that while team objectives  
are critically important, they are not the only things that the  
product team is working on. Every team has some level of on-  
going “keep-the-lights-on” activities. This includes such things  
asfixingcriticalbugs,handlingcustomersituations,andsoforth.  
10\. Normally, these team objectives are created or updated every  
quarter. That gives teams enough time to make real progress,  
yet not too much time that the business can’t adjust to changes.  
There may be occasional situations where team objectives need  
to change during the quarter, but these should be the exception  
rather than the rule.  
Tokeepallthisinperspective,rememberthattheessenceofthisis  
simply having a knowledgeable leader sit down with the product team  
and explainthe strategiccontext. Then, explainthe problem you need  
the team to solve, and how success is measured.  
WhetheryouuseaformaltechniquelikeOKRstodothisismuch  
less important. The key is to have this conversation, and for leaders to  
provide the necessary coaching, and give the product teams the space  
to solve the problems in the best way they see fit. **CHAPTER**

# Leader Profile\:  
# Christina Wodtke  
# Path to Leadership  
I first met Christina in 2003, when she  
was running a design team at early Yahoo.  
Christina had studied photography in art  
school and learned product design work-  
ing with several early internet teams.  
Ithenwatchedhercareerasshespent

WhichiswhyIfeltshefoundhertruecallingjoiningthefacultyat

Christina has also published several books, mostly around the  
theme of strong, empowered product teams—including a popular  
book on OKRs and another on leadership and team empowerment.1  
This is why I’ve always considered her a kindred spirit.  
# Leadership in Action  
Christina was very fortunate to learn product and design directly  
from some exceptional leaders. They showed her the real power of an  
empowered team.  
Here’s her story in her own words\:  
I joined Yahoo in 2002, when the internet was still very young,  
and Yahoo was at the time a very fast-growing and influential tech  
company.  
I wasthefirstdesignerforthesearchteam andwas luckyenough  
to work for Irene Au.  
IrenehadbeenaproductdesignerforNetscape,andshewenton  
to build the design team at Yahoo and later Google.  
IrenebelievedIhadpotential,andeventhoughIdidn’thaveman-  
agement experience in tech \(I had been a restaurant manager back in  
mystarvingartistdays\)Irenementoredmeandgavememyfirstdirect  
reports.  
Her real teaching, though, was watching her empower and grow  
everyone who worked for her. She gave me the role model I needed\:  
someonewhowasstrongyetalwayskind.Shetaughtmethatyoudon’t  
have to choose between empathy and authority.  
1Christina Wodtke, Radical Focus \(San Francisco\: Cucina Media LLC, 2015\) and The Team  
That Managed Itself \(San Francisco\: Cucina Media LLC, 2019\) are good examples. **306** EMPOWERED  
Soon, another very influential person played a significant role in  
my career.  
Jeff Weiner ran the search business at Yahoo, and he later went  
on to join LinkedIn \(coincidentally, when I worked there as a product  
manager\) and has been their CEO for nearly 12 years.  
Jeffwas the personwho first encouragedme to move into a lead-  
ership role, running the Search design team, which meant at least 20  
people. Overnight, I managed way more people than I had ever done  
before.  
I definitely had my doubts. I had been getting more comfortable  
withmanagingthetwofolkswhoreportedtome,butthispositionwas  
likely to develop into a serious leadership role, and I wasn’t at all sure  
I would be able to do the job.  
I’llneverforgetthemoment.Weweresittinginthecafeteria,and  
I told Jeff he should try to find someone better. He said, “I know you  
can do this job.” He believed in me so hard I had to believe in myself.  
During this period of rapid growth for Yahoo, and especially  
search, I soon found myself not just a manager, but a manager of  
managers for a fairly large-sized group. A total of 80 people reported  
into 9 managers who reported to me.  
I realized I needed to stop designing products in order to start  
designing a place where good design could happen. I had to design teams  
that could manage themselves.  
With such a large group covering such a range of design skills, it  
wascleartomethattherewasnowayIcouldbeanexpertinallofthese  
areas. And even if I was, I didn’t have time to do everything. I realized  
thenthat,ifIeverwantedtosleepagain,theonlywayIwouldsucceed  
was if I could trust and depend on my team.  
When I sat down for the first meeting with the managers who  
reported to me, one asked me a question about how to handle a prob-  
lem. I don’t recall what it was, but I do recall that I asked him what he  
thought we should do. He made a suggestion, and I said, “Great. Let’s  
dothat.”Thatwasthemomentwhenthepowershiftedfrommetowe.  
From then on, those meetings were a place where anyone could bring  
any problem and we’d all work on it as a team.  
I’ve been making teams out of groups of individuals ever since.  
Teams can make miracles happen when no individual can. Leader Profile\: *Christina Wodtke* **307**  
Finally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention one other person who  
changed how I saw teams at Yahoo. Ken Norton also worked for Jeff,  
and Ken ran product management for Yahoo Shopping. Ken went on  
to a long and very successful career in product at Google, and then  
Google Ventures.  
Until I met Ken, I thought product managers were essentially  
projectmanagersIhadtochaseawayfrommydesignerssotheycould

I know so many designers that have never met a strong product  
manager, but once you have, you don’t want to go back.

# Case Study  
**T**his case study is necessarily quite detailed. To get a true under-  
standing of why a company and product organization make the  
decisions they do, you need considerable context.  
Ifyoubelieveyoualreadyhaveasolidgraspoftheconceptsinthis  
book, especiallyin terms of team topology, product strategy, and team  
objectives, then feel free to skim this part.  
However, my hope is that you will consider the effort to under-  
stand the details of this example worthwhile, as you will see how  
these important, but difficult, concepts play out in practice—in a  
real organization struggling with rapid growth, scale, and tech-debt  
challenges.  
You will also be able to see a detailed example of how a company staffed  
with ordinary people was able to achieve extraordinary results.  
This case study is based on my experience with an actual jobs  
marketplace company.  
**309** **310** EMPOWERED  
I chose this company because I think this is a good, represen-  
tative example of a growth-stage company dealing with challenges  
of scale.  
Thecompanyalsohaselementsofanenterprisebusinessandele-  
ments of an early-stage startup. So, I think this case study applies to  
most companies.  
I also like using a jobs marketplace company because they sell to  
businesses on one side \(employers\) and consumers on the other side  
\(job seekers\), and they have an internal platform supporting both.  
However, there are two important caveats\:  
First, this example represents the company at a specific point in  
time \(from a few years ago\). There is obviously relevant history that  
impacted the situation I encountered, but in this case study, we take  
their situation as a given.  
Second,whilethisisbasedonanactualexample,Ididtakethelib-  
erty of layering on a couple additional complexities that did not occur  
during this particular quarter, but do occur frequently enough—and  
did in fact did occur at this company at a later point in time. I feel it’s  
helpful to illustrate how these situations were handled in practice. So,  
inthiscasestudy,Iportraythatallofthesethingshappenedinthesame  
quarter.  
I do not share in this case study the actual company name or  
identifying information. That’s because, for a case study to be truly  
useful, I need to share with you the good, the bad, and the ugly.  
Mostcompaniesareunderstandablynoteagertoshareanythingother  
than the good, even if things managed to turn out well, as was the  
case here.  
One of the benefits to choosing a jobs marketplace is that there  
are many of them around the world, and I’ve had the chance to work  
with quite a few of them. I’ve found that, while every situation truly is  
unique, most of the important dynamics are not so different between  
them.ThathelpsmehaveconfidencethatIcanbecandidhereandnot  
worry about embarrassing anyone personally.  
You’ll see that there’s a lot going on here, and it can appear  
messy, which is simply a reflection of reality in this, and indeed most  
companies—even ones that do very well. Case Study **311**  
Finally, please don’t confuse a case study with any sort of ideal  
situation.Therearemanythingsthatcouldhavebeendonedifferently,  
and arguably better, but the point of a case study is to show what was  
actually done and why.  
Hopefully, this example will give you a good sense for the types  
of considerations you will want to keep in mind as you face these and  
similar questions yourselves, and the type of leadership you will need  
to provide. **CHAPTER**  
# 62  
# Company  
# Backgrounder  
**T**o understand this case study, it’s important to have at least a  
high-level understanding of this company’s business. It’s a typical,  
two-sided marketplace with employers on one side and job seekers on  
the other.  
On the employer side, the company sells job postings to busi-  
nesses, ranging from individual hiring managers at small businesses,  
uptomedium-sizedbusinesses.Theywerestartingtoseeinterestfrom  
larger enterprises with dedicated HR departments, but the product at  
this point in time was not yet designed or suitable for this market.  
Onthejob-seekerside,thefocusisonpeopleactivelylookingfor  
new employment—in their case, mainly for professional \(aka white-  
collar\) jobs. Specifically, these are not hourly or temporary workers.1

marketplace, there are both active job seekers \(need a job now\) and passive job seekers \(if  
somethingbettercomesalongI’llcheckitout\).Theyhavedifferentneeds,andthereisreal

**312** Company Backgrounder **313**  
At the time of this case study, the company is currently five years  
old, with annual revenues of approximately \$45MM and growing at  
roughly 30% per year. They are close to profitability but are trying to  
focus on growth.  
Thereareapproximately230peopleinthecompany—95inprod-  
uct/engineering, 45 in sales, 17 in marketing, 33 in customer success,  
10 in IT, and 30 in G&A.  
In terms of the executive team, there was a CEO, CFO, head of  
sales\(CRO\),andheadofmarketing\(CMO\).Then,ofcourse,therewas  
a head of product \(CPO\) and a head of technology \(CTO\) and you’ll  
read about both of them below.  
It’s worth pointing out that in large enterprises, this is also about  
the size of a typical business unit. **CHAPTER**  
# 63  
# Company Objectives  
**E**ach year, the company’s board of directors sets annual company  
objectives. This involves a substantial amount of consideration  
and debate among the executive team and the members of the board  
about business strategy, competitive landscape, and potential levels of  
investment.  
Theboardhastheoptionofraising  
additional capital, or using other forms  
of financing, or deciding the company  
should focus instead on becoming cash  
flow positive—potentially at the expense  
of growth—or anything in between.  
**314** Company Objectives **315**  
The overall guidance this year was to continue to grow and  
improve the core business—not taking the eye off the ball in terms of  
helping employers fill jobs, helping seekers find jobs, and continuing  
to grow the business with strong growth rates.  
Thisyear,however,thecompanyhasdecidedthereisapromising  
expansionopportunityinpursuinglargeenterprises,1 andtheywantto  
look into broadening the company’s products and go-to-market cap-  
ability to better serve this market.  
They have decided to increase the investment level by funding  
an additional product team \(6 additional people\), as well as addi-  
tional enterprise-specific sales, marketing, and customer-success staff  
\(11 additional people\).  
The board explained that, if this initial foray into enterprise goes  
well,theyexpecttomakeamoresizableinvestmentthefollowingyear.  
As a reminder, these company objectives are coming from the  
senior executive team, with the support and approval of the board  
of directors. These are presented here in OKR format, but what  
is important is \(1\) their focus on a small number of meaningful  
objectives, and \(2\) they are measuring the results based on business  
results.  
Objective 1\: Continue to grow core business.  
• Key Result 1\: Grow core business revenue by at least 25%.  
• Key Result 2\: Reduce annual employer churn from 6% down to  
5% or lower.  
• Key Result 3\: Increase seeker success rate from 23% to at least  
27%.

ThesewereprimarilycomingfromHRpeoplewhohadusedthejobsmarketplaceatformer

Objective 2\: Establish company as a proven provider for  
enterprise-class companies.  
• Key Result 1\: Demonstrate product/market fit by developing no  
fewer than six enterprise-class reference employers. **CHAPTER**

# Product Vision and  
# Principles  
**T**he company has a strong and compelling product vision and prin-  
ciples, but I will not share it here as it would make obvious the  
actual company being profiled.  
However, I can say that the com-  
pany was founded on the desire to help  
people find the best job possible given  
their capabilities, and to help employ-  
ers find strong candidates for their open  
positions.  
While that’s easy to say, this  
company depends on repeat business  
from employers, and when faced with decisions that trade off  
short-term benefits for their company versus the long-term benefit  
for their customers, I saw them consistently deciding in favor of their  
customers.  
**317** **318** EMPOWERED  
I saw those values and principles play out multiple times, so at  
least I was personally convinced that they weren’t just empty words.  
Most important, the leaders of product management, engineer-  
ing, and design—and the members of the product teams—had the  
product vision, product principles, and especially the product strategy  
in mind as they decided on, and then pursued, their team objectives. **CHAPTER**

# Employer Organization  
The Employer organization is there to serve the needs of the hiring  
managers and HR departments. They currently offer a freemium  
service where the first job posting is free, but to get additional  
postings—or premium services including featured jobs—there are  
listing and promotional fees.  
These are the actual product teams and what each is responsible  
for\:2  
Employer Home—This team is responsible for the dashboard for  
employers showing current job postings and applications in  
various states of review. This team also provides the ability to  
post a job, and to ensure that job is visible in organic search  
results \(SEO\).

2Just to be clear, the “product” is the jobs marketplace, and each of these 16 product teams  
is responsible for a subset of this larger product. **322** EMPOWERED  
Employer Communications—This team manages the several forms of  
ongoingcommunicationswithemployers,especiallyhavingtodo

job\) and marketing \(encouragingthe employer to post additional  
jobs\). This team is also responsible for online recruiting of new  
employer customers looking to post jobs \(SEO and SEM\).  
Enterprise Tools \(newly formed team\)—As the company moves toward  
helping large enterprises with their recruiting, they believe they  
need several enterprise-specific capabilities, such as integration  
with large-scale applicant-tracking systems \(ATS\). This team  
is focused on identifying what is necessary to satisfy enterprise  
employers and delivering those capabilities.3  
# Job Seeker Organization  
The Job Seeker organization is focused on helping people who are  
looking for a job to find a job.  
Seeker Home—This team provides the core experience for the job  
seeker on both the web and native mobile apps. This includes a  
dashboard of jobs the seeker is currently tracking, the status of  
applications, and recommendations for other jobs that may be a  
fit.  
Job Search—This team provides the services that allow a job seeker  
to search the marketplace based on job attributes.  
Job Recommendations—This team utilizes the data that has been col-  
lected in terms of searches and the seeker profile, and generates  
recommended jobs.  
3This team ended up embedding a product marketing person full-time on the team  
because there was so much critical work to be done in terms of developing the reference  
customers, the go-to-market considerations, and starting to understand and prepare the  
sales-enablement materials. This turned out to be very important and is a great practice  
for any product where messaging more specifically to a target segment or a new business

Job Applications—This team allows a seeker to apply for a specific  
job—collecting the information that has already been provided  
and combining it with any job-specific information that may be  
needed for that particular job.  
Seeker Communications—This team handles the various forms of  
communication with job seekers including email, text, and noti-  
fications. This is both transactional \(status of a job application\)  
as well as marketing \(encouraging the seeker to return and apply  
for additional jobs\). This team is also responsible for online  
recruiting of new job seekers \(SEM and SEO\).  
Mobile Apps—This team provides job seekers with a native mobile  
experience for both iOS and Android devices. This team works  
very closely with the Seeker Home team as they try to keep the  
web experience and the mobile experiences comparable.4

but also including finance, marketing, sales, and company lead-  
ership. This team provides the reporting infrastructure that is  
fed to the employer and seeker dashboards, as well as enabling  
self-service reporting by the rest of the company.

# Product Strategy  
**N**ow that the company objectives are clear and the product vision  
andprinciplesareinplace,theleadersoftheproductorganization  
\(in this case, the CPO, the CTO, and their managers\) need to update  
their product strategy to deliver on the company objectives.  
Notethatthereisnoguaranteethat  
they will be able to come up with a way  
to do everything the board is hoping for  
in the year.  
If the product leaders determine  
this is just not plausible, then the leaders  
will need to raise this back up to the  
CEO to either consider increasing  
funding or reducing some of the expectations, or possibly a blend of  
the two. But before that can be known, they will need to work closely  
with the product teams to determine what they believe they cando.  
**325** **326** EMPOWERED  
It’s also important to note that, while the company objectives  
are annual, the product team objectives are quarterly. So, the product  
leaders and product teams have the ability to adjust course based on  
progress, obstacles encountered, new learnings and new insights, and  
new opportunities uncovered.  
As a reminder of the big picture regarding product strategy\:  
Recallthataproductstrategybeginswithfocusonasmallnumber  
of truly important objectives.  
Then we will search for insights that can be leveraged to make a  
real impact on these company objectives.  
Next,wewillmaptheinsightsintoaction,whichmeansidentifying  
a set of one or more objectives for each product team to work on.  
Finally, the managers will need to actively track progress on the  
objectives and be prepared to remove obstacles and make adjustments  
in support of the product teams.  
# Focus  
The leaders of the company have identified two company objectives  
for the year. One is around continuing to grow the core business, and  
the other is around exploring a new expansion product.  
In this situation, the senior leaders of the company have helped  
considerablywithfocusbynarrowingdownthecompanyobjectivesto  
just two key objectives. If the leaders had a much larger list, then the  
productstrategylikelywouldhaveneededtobeginwithnarrowingthat  
list down.  
Ineverycompany,therearemanyopportunitiesthatcouldbepur-  
sued. In this case, they were seriously debating geographic expansion,  
as well as offering additional services to employers \(e.g., verification  
services and drug testing services\), but none of these made the cut for  
this year.  
Note that the context also included guidance that pursuing the  
new business opportunity should not come at the expense of the work  
on the core business. Product Strategy **327**  
# Insights  
# Growing Core Business Objective  
The first company objective pertains to growing the core business.  
Thebusinessresultthecompanyhopesforis25%growth,andof  
course, there are any number of strategies for achieving this growth.  
But the leaders realize it’s unlikely that just optimizing the current  
product will yield more than 5–10% growth.  
There is organic growth still occurring in this space, but there  
are alsoseveralnew competitors now, sothey do not want to count on  
organic growth.  
Theybelievetheymustdoabetterjobthaneverintakingcareof  
their current customers—both employers and seekers—and, in addi-  
tion, they must go out and win new customers.  
Akeypartoftheproductstrategyworkinvolvesareviewanddis-  
cussionofthekeymarketplacehealthKPIsanduserresearchlearnings.  
In particular, they know that employers want to fill jobs quickly,  
but they want to make sure they are providing their hiring managers  
with a choice of qualifiedcandidates.  
Employers are obviously disappointed when they receive no  
applications, and they are frustrated and slow to decide when they  
have only a very small number of applications. That much was well  
known.  
However, what was not well known—and was a consequence  
of doing some user research motivated by an observation from the  
data—is that, if there are too many applications for a given job, it  
creates its own set of problems. This is because it takes too long for  
employers to sift through and make a hiring decision. Further, on the  
jobs where too many people apply, this also leaves a disproportionate  
number of disappointed job seekers.  
Theiranalysisofthedatashowsthatpositionsarefilledthefastest,  
and hiring managers are happiest, when they receive a minimum of 8  
but nomorethan25qualifiedapplications. **328** EMPOWERED  
Based on these numbers, they know that 28% of employer  
job postings receive too few applications and 7% receive too many.  
While this doesn’t sound so bad, it’s worse than it looks because  
the most-appealing jobs are getting way too many applicants, and  
disappointing far too many job seekers. Once a job posting has  
enough qualified applicants, maybe the algorithms could direct those  
candidates to more promising jobs?  
They believe this correlates directly with employer churn, espe-  
cially for those receiving too few applications.  
They also believe this correlates directly with seeker satisfaction,  
especiallyforthemanypeoplewhoapplyforajobthey’reexcitedabout  
but never hear back.  
So, as a strategic focus for the next quarter or two \(depending on  
progress\), they want employer teams to figure out ways of helping a  
higher percentage of jobs to get at least 8 qualified applications, and  
they also want to reduce the number of jobs that get more than 25  
applications.Theybelievethiswillreduceemployerchurn,generating  
morejob postingsperemployerwhilealsogeneratingmoresuccessful  
responses for job seekers.  
From the job-seeker perspective, they know job seekers need to  
find a job. The clock is ticking. They are looking for a good fit, and  
theywouldliketohaveachoiceofjobs,butitisprimarilyaboutquickly  
finding a match.  
They know from the data that, if a job seeker does not submit at  
least one application in her first 48 hours using the marketplace, then  
sheisveryunlikelytoreturn.Theyalsoknowthatonly27%ofseekers  
who register actually submit at least one application.  
Theyalsoknowfromthedatathatthereisasubstantialdifference  
inseekersuccessforthosejobseekersthatdownloadthenativemobile

Whilethefirstinsightwasnotasurprise\(youonlyhavea48-hour

istering is such a large percentage of the work involved in submitting  
an application, and they struggled to understand why so many people  
would successfullycomplete the registrationprocess,yet not applyfor  
at least one job. Product Strategy **329**  
So, as the second strategic focus for the next quarter, they want  
seeker teams to figure out ways of helping more job seekers find  
a match and submit at least one application in that first 48-hour  
window—especially for the people who have registered.  
# Enterprise Employer Objective  
The second company objective is fairly straightforward. Not easy, but  
clear. They will have a new-product team, and that team will have a  
clear assignment based on the company objective.  
They know that many of the assumptions around the core busi-  
nessmaynotholdtrueforthisnewproduct,assellingtoenterprisesis  
substantiallydifferentfromsellingdirectlytohiringmanagers.There-  
fore, they want to approach this objective by starting with identifying  
product/market fit. Further, they don’t want the team distracted with  
anything else as they pursue product/market fit. It is all too easy for a  
team to get ahead of themselves with a new product.  
While the work for the new team is straightforward, they are  
expecting that some of the work the new team needs to do will impact  
several of the other teams.  
Demonstrating product/market fit in the enterprise will likely be  
an initiative that spans most of the year and will require changes and  
support from several other teams—probably most, if not all, of the  
Employerorganizationteams,andatleasttheJobSeekerorganization  
JobApplicationteam,andmost,ifnotall,ofthePlatformorganization  
teams.  
Therefore,theywillneedtoensurethatthoseteamshavesupport

# Re-platforming Objective  
Whilethetwocompanyobjectiveswilldrivemuchoftheproductwork,  
thereisanotherobjectivethatcomesnotfromthecompanyexecutives  
or board, but rather from the product leaders.  
Theorganizationhadbeenstrugglingwithsomeverysubstantial

ceding several years. The previous year, the engineering organization **330** EMPOWERED

tional order—over what they estimated would take roughly two years.  
Note that the engineering team believed they could accomplish  
thisre-platformingworkinashortertimeframeiftheywerewillingto  
pause or suspend other work. However, this would have caused major  
disruption in the ability to add ongoing capabilities for the business.  
This was therefore considered too risky to the business, so they  
instead decided on an incremental plan to strategically rebuild the  
infrastructure over a two-year period. This quarter represents the  
third quarter of work on this plan.  
Much of this work, but by no means all, was expected to fall on  
the platform product teams.  
# Action  
The leaders are now ready to turn these insights into action, which  
meanstogetteamsworkingonsolvingtheproblemstheyneedtosolve.  
They know they could simply assign problems to each product  
team, but they also know that this would miss some important infor-  
mation.  
While they understand the problems and the insights, what they  
knowtheycan’tknowistheenablingtechnologyavailabletoeachteam,

Duringthissession,theheadofproductstartsbyupdatingevery-

work and sharing the relevant data—and especially the insights.  
The leaders explain that, in the coming days, they will approach  
each product team with one or two important problems to solve in  
support of these three objectives. But, in the meantime, they’d like  
the teams to consider the problems and the ideas and technology they  
believe can help.2  
They explain to the teams that, if everyone wanted to work on  
the samething, thiswouldof coursenot workbecausetheyhaveto do  
their best to cover all three objectives.  
However, they also explain that, if a product team is especially  
optimistic about a problem they believe they can help on, they are  
motivated to try to accommodate those desires wherever possible.  
Note that this process is necessarily a combination of top down  
andbottomup.Theteamshaveallbeenprovidedthecompanyobjec-

back and forth with the leadership to ensure that as much of the com-  
panyobjectivescanbecompletedaspossible.However,thekeyresults  
always come from the bottom up.  
# Management  
In the next chapter, we’ll share where the team objectives actually  
ended up for each of the product teams. However, it would be  
misleading to share these results without describing the many obsta-  
cles and challenges that had to be dealt with to get to where they  
landed.  
office. The reason this company pushed for most if not all engineers to attend is that they  
were big believers in the role engineers play in innovation.  
2Just to be clear, we don’t expect every team to contribute to every objective, as different  
objectivesaremorerelevanttodifferentteams.However,wedowanteachteamtoconsider  
whattheymightbeabletodotohelpwiththespecificteamobjectivesandthemore-general  
company objectives, and to make it known when they identify promising opportunities. **332** EMPOWERED  
Therefore,herearethemajorobstaclesthatemerged,alongwith  
how those obstacles were dealt with\:  
• Too much work landed on one particular team—in this case, the  
Employer Home team. The two solutions the leaders came up  
with were to either pass some of the work to other teams or add  
one or more engineers to this team. They ended up doing some  
of both.  
• The most common obstacle was when one team identified a  
dependency on another team and needed to know whether or  
not they could count on getting what they need during the  
quarter. This happened both while planning for the quarter,  
and in multiple cases during the quarter, when the teams were  
deeper into the work. The dependency was mostly on a platform  
team, but sometimes, for example, a change to an employer  
team required a change from a job seeker team. In each case, it  
required the managers to talk directly to the parties involved to  
seeifandwhenthedependencycouldbeaccommodated.Inmost  
cases, a little “horse trading” was able to satisfy both parties.3  
• TheEmployerHometeamidentifiedthat theyneededsomesig-  
nificant SEO help from product marketing to be able to deliver  
on their objectives. The managers ended up embedding an SEO  
person into this team for the quarter. They believed from their  
dataanalysisofthenew-seekerfunnelthat,iftheycoulddoabet-  
terjobonSEO,theycouldattractmore-qualifiedjobseekersand  
as a result improve the success rate.  
• The Infrastructure team had shared the technical debt  
re-platforming plan, as they had the prior quarters, but one  
of the teams \(Enterprise Tools\) realized that the timing was not  
going to be good for a critical area they needed to work on.  
The Infrastructure team ended up changing the specific modules  
planned for the quarter to avoid wasted work.  
3However, there were some cases where the platform team could not commit to providing  
whatwasneededearlyenoughfortheexperienceteamtouseintimetofinishinthequarter.  
In this case, the experience team was not able to deliver their solutions until the following  
quarter. Product Strategy **333**  
• The Shared Services team ended up with a very long list of work  
thattheyneededtodoinordertosupportthevariousexperience  
teams,andtheyneededhelpprioritizingallthedifferentrequests  
cominginfromallthedifferentteams.Thiswasaddressedinpart  
by providing guidance on priorities. However, in certain cases, it  
worked best to allow the experience team to write the necessary  
software and then contribute that code to the platform \(pending  
approval by the Shared Services team\). **CHAPTER**  
# 67  
# Product Team Objectives  
**W**hat follows below is the result of the negotiation between the  
productleadersandtheproductteams,andalsothenegotiation  
between the teams themselves when one identified a dependency on  
another.  
In some cases, the objectives that  
were initially suggested by the team  
worked out fine, but in other cases there  
was substantial back and forth so as to  
maximize the likelihood that as much of  
thecompany’sannualobjectivesaspossi-  
ble couldbe achieved.1 Much of this was  
reflectedinthediscussiononthedesired  
level of ambition for each objective.  
1It’s important to emphasize that this back and forth is normal. It is a reflection of the fact  
that some things come from the leaders and other things come from the teams.  
**334** Product Team Objectives **335**  
Please keep in mind that the team objectives are not meant  
to cover everything a product team works on—they all have other  
work, especially “keep-the-lights-on” work and other issues that will  
inevitably arise. The team objectives are intended to cover the critical  
work in support of the company objectives.  
Rememberthattheseobjectivesareproblems to solve—theyarenot  
solutions.Theteamsareexpectedtotryoutpotentialsolutionsindis-  
covery and pursue solutions where they have evidence they will work.  
This is what is meant by an empowered team.  
You’ll also note that several of the teams have been assigned the  
same problem to solve. In most cases, these were common objectives  
because these were the most important problems that needed to  
be solved, and so multiple teams were asked to tackle them as they  
pertained to their area. This is fine, and is a consequence of their  
product strategy, and I would argue appropriate in their particular  
case. But it’s important to note that it’s not necessary either.2  
With these common objectives, the teams will need to commu-  
nicate and coordinate closely, and also management will need to help  
connect the dots where necessary, which mainly occurs during the  
ongoing coaching.  
# Company Dashboard  
What follows is a subset of the company’s dashboard, containing the  
KPIs related to the product strategy.  
Employers\: Improve success rate for employers  
\(% of jobs that successfully fill during 60-day posting cycle\)  
• Current employer success rate\: 37%  
• % postings with fewer than 8 qualified apps\: 39%  
• % postings with more than 25 qualified apps\: 7%  
• % postings with between 8 and 25 apps\: 54%  
• Average number of postings per account\: 5.9  
• Employer churn rate \(annualized\)\: 6%  
2Unless otherwise noted, all the key results are aspirational. The specific level of ambition  
is discussed in sidebar “Level of Ambition.” **336** EMPOWERED  
Job Seekers\: Improve success rate for seekers  
\(% of seekers that successfully find job in 60-day job search  
period\)  
• Current seeker success rate\: 23% \(average\)  
• % registered seekers that submit ≥1 application in first 48 hours\:  
27%  
• % seeker success rate for app users\: 32%  
• % seeker success rate for non-app users\: 15%  
• Average number of applications per job search\: 3.2  
# Employer Organization  
Employer Home—The Employer Home team believed they now had  
enough historical posting and seeker data to make intelligent recom-  
mendations to the hiring manager during the creation of the job post-  
ing, which would significantly increase the likelihood of a successful  
posting.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for employers via  
recommendations.  
• Key result\: Increase employer success rate from 37% to 39%.  
• Key result\: Increase postings with more than 8 qualified applica-  
tions and less than 25 from 54% to 58%.  
Recruiter Tools—The Recruiter Tools team expected to be signifi-

order to collaborate to solve the shared team objective. Product Team Objectives **337**  
Objective \(shared with the Enterprise Tools team\)  
• KR \(shared with the Enterprise Tools team\)  
Premium Services—The Premium Services team had a risky, but  
potentially significant, theory where they believed that certain of  
their services should be made available to all employer postings. They  
believed this because they had evidence that these features generate  
more successful postings, hence less churn, and that overall, total  
revenue would rise. They proposed to pursue this theory by running  
a series of targeted tests. They expect that the reduction in churn rate  
will take time to show up, but that employer success rate increase  
should be predictive.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for employers via premium

Enterprise Tools \(new team\)—This new team took the lead on  
the enterprise objective initiative and worked with the other teams  
as needed. Their intention was to immediately begin a customer  
discovery program with eight prospective enterprise customers that  
had already been identified by the sales organization. Their intention  
is to use these early prospective customers to discover and deliver  
product/market fit for this new market.  
Objective\: Demonstrate product/market fit for enterprise.

# Job Seeker Organization  
Seeker Home—The Seeker Home team believed they could leverage  
historical data to introduce intelligent personalization to the seeker’s  
home dashboard to guide job seekers to more-suitable jobs. Note that  
this is a shared team objective with the Job Recommendations team.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for seekers via

tions, the search capability can continuously scan new postings and  
ensure the seeker is notified immediately upon a new match.  
5Ultimately, the measure of success for this Enterprise Tools team is to develop at least six  
reference customers for the initial enterprise product offering. However, the leaders and  
the team expected that it would likely take more than a single quarter \(but hopefully less  
than two quarters\), so then the question was what would be a good proxy KPI for real  
progress towards this business result. The decision was made to use active participation in

• KR\: Increase seeker success from 23% to 25%.  
• KR\: Increase percentage of applications from search results from  
0% to 3%.  
Job Recommendations—The Job Recommendations team believed  
they could improve the quality of their recommendations and help  
seekers find the jobs they didn’t realize they were qualified for. Note  
that this is a shared team objective with the Seeker Home team.  
Objective\:Improvesuccessrateforseekersviarecommendations.  
• KR\: Increase seeker success from 23% to 25%.  
• KR\: Increase % of applications from recommendations from 3%  
to 5%.  
Job Applications—The Job Applications team signed up to make  
the application process significantly more intelligent. Once a seeker  
has applied to one job, it would be significantly faster and easier to  
apply to others, from any device, any time.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for seekers via applications.  
• KR\: Increase seeker success from 23% to 25%.  
• KR\: Increase average number of applications submitted from 3.2  
to 4.  
Seeker Communications—The Seeker Communications team  
embraced the concept of “first 48 hours” as a theme and planned  
a series of experiments with a richer and more timely experience  
during this period—at least until the first application has been  
submitted.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for seekers via communications.  
• KR\: Increase seeker success from 23% to 25%.  
• KR\: Increase first app in first 48 hours from 27% to 30%. **340** EMPOWERED  
Mobile Apps—The Mobile Apps team proposed to focus on

during the first 48 hours, but also ongoing as new potential job  
matches were discovered.  
Objective\: Improve success rate for seekers via app.  
• KR\: Increase seeker success of app users from 32% to 35%.  
• KR\: Increase percentage of first-time seekers that install and use  
the app from 17% to 20%.

Infrastructure—The Infrastructure team was in the midst of a  
two-year re-platforming effort to address the substantial tech-debt  
issues. The emergence of the enterprise effort caused the team to  
propose adjusting the sequencing of work to ensure the ATS integra-

# Level of Ambition  
With aspirational key results, it’s important to have a clear under-  
standing of how ambitious the team is being with their key results  
for the quarter.  
This is often a place where company culture shows through.  
Some companies encourage their teams to be very ambitious \(moon  
shots\),andotherswanttheteamstobeveryconservative\(roofshots\).  
Some ask their teams to project some level of confidence in the key  
results \(e.g., “Your key results should be with 70% confidence.”\).  
In this company, the leaders used subjective terms to describe  
to the teams the level of ambition they were hoping for. In general,

This concentration of effort around getting more jobs to have  
between 8 and 25 applications did indeed pay off. This was mostly  
the result of spreadingaroundthe applicationsthat were being wasted  
by going to jobs that already had enough. At the end of the quarter,

As you have seen, the company attacked these problems from  
many different angles, in the hopes that some would succeed. The

improve for at least two more years.  
**343** **344** EMPOWERED  
On the job seeker side, they ended up making fairly fundamental  
changes to the workflow of first registering and then providing  
the first application. They were able to significantly improve the  
percentage of job seekers that submitted an application in the first 48  
hours \(from 27% to 42%\), primarily by making the first application  
submission much easier and more integrated with the registration  
process.

Intermsoftheobjectiveforachievingproduct/marketfitforsell-

out a direct sales channel. However, the company found that moving  
from selling online directly to hiring managers, to selling through a  
direct sales force to HR organizations, required much larger changes  
than they had anticipated. It took the better part of a year to get the

1\. The critical role that the product leaders need to play—from  
the topology, to the product strategy, to the team objectives, to  
actively managing the issues and obstacles that came up during  
the quarter.  
2\. The importance of a true product strategy based on focus and  
insights.Theproductstrategyiswhattellsuswhichproblemswe

as good as the strategy.  
**346** Key Takeaways **347**  
3\. Theimportanceofactivemanagementofteamobjectives—both  
by the product teams themselves, but also from the product  
leaders. If the teams do not stay on top of their objectives, life  
intervenes, and pretty soon much of the quarter is gone and not  
enough has been done.  
4\. The value of empowering teams and teams of missionaries.  
The real innovations that occurred were all a direct result of  
having empowered teams excited to work on a hard problem  
that can make a real difference for the customers and for the  
company.  
5\. Thelimitationsofwhatyoucanknowandwhatyoucan’tknow.

6\. Theriskmanagementelementofplacingaseriesofbets,know-

based on how strong the data insights were, how much confi-  
dence they had in the specific people and teams, and how confi-  
dent the teams were in their ability to make an impact.  
7\. The impact that the team topology has on converting the  
insights into action. A different topology would have resulted  
in different assignments and likely very different results. Maybe  
better, maybe worse, but definitely different. This topology has  
some clear virtues but also some real limitations.  
8\. The necessary give and take between the leaders and the  
productteams—partlytopdown,partlybottomup.Theleaders  
did not abdicate their responsibility by inviting the teams to

smart leaders usually find a way to make it work because they  
trust their teams, accept the uncertainty, and manage the risks  
appropriately.

# Path to Leadership  
Judy studied at London Business School  
and began her professional career at the  
same company \(Hewlett Packard\), and at  
the same timeframe, as I did.  
She joined HP back during the PC  
era, where she learned product manage-  
ment and product marketing. Judy was  
based in the UK, and I was based in Silicon Valley, but we met  
**349** **350** EMPOWERED  
and became friends, and I’ve watched her career, and witnessed her  
leadership, ever since.  
She went from HP to Apple, where she spent 7 years in prod-  
uct development, product management, and technology evangelism,  
and then she moved to Microsoft, where she spent 10 years building  
and leading Microsoft’s global consumer internet business \(MSN\).  
After Microsoft, Judy began advising and investing in startups  
and serving as a board member and chairman for several companies  
that realized they needed to transform, starting at the very top.  
HercareerhasgivenJudyexperiencewithnearlyeveryaspectofa

several very rapidly growing businesses.  
# Leadership in Action  
Here’s Judy in her own words\:  
Early in my career I was fortunate to work at Hewlett  
Packard—both in the UK and in Silicon Valley—first as a systems  
engineer then a product manager.  
BillHewlettandDavePackardcreatedaverystrongvalues-based  
cultureandoperatingprincipleswhichwereenshrinedinThe HP Way.  
These included “The company believes the best results come  
when you get the right people, trust them, give them freedom to find  
the best path to achieve objectives, and let them share in the rewards  
their work makes possible.”  
This translated into other practices such as “always hire people  
smarter than yourself,” “employee empowerment,” and “it’s all about  
the customer.”  
HP was also a pioneer in the adoption of management by objec-  
tives, the foundation for today’s objectives and key results. My seven  
yearsthereprovidedaformidableeducationwhichhasstayedwithme  
throughout my career. Leader Profile\: *Judy Gibbons* **351**  
WheneverIseeorganizationsthatdon’thavestrongvaluesalong  
with a culture of collaboration and empowerment, I know they are  
going to struggle to deliver great customer experiences and therefore  
business value.  
Technology makes many things possible, but if it doesn’t deliver  
on the needs of the customer, it will not deliver on the needs of the  
business.  
After HP, I joined Apple, where Steve Jobs so effectively demon-  
strated the importance and power of articulating a compelling vision  
of what can be achieved with technology and at the same time being  
obsessed about the customer experience.  
Product teams at Apple were more diverse and included product  
design as well as product managers and developers who were able to  
combine their skills effectively to innovate in extraordinary ways.  
I next joined Microsoft to launch MSN, its consumer internet  
service. This was a product on a new platform—the web—and with  
constantlyupdatedcontent.And,ofcourse,newbusinessmodels.Asa  
result,theproductteamsdiversifiedfurthertoincludenewsjournalists,  
producers, and advertising professionals.  
But the need was still the same\: a clear vision, creativity about  
what’s possible, learning from the customer, and constant iteration.  
Diversity is talked about a lot these days, but nowhere is it more  
important than in product teams. Great things can happen when you  
give creative, passionate people the freedom to explore ideas.  
Creativity is needed to come up with original ideas, which need  
to be critiqued, evaluated, and elaborated. Many different possibilities  
need to be explored before focusing on those that have the most  
potential value. And it is product teams that are able to combine these  
different behaviors—and switch between them in flexible ways—that  
are best suited to succeed in the world in which we now find  
ourselves.  
WhenIleftMicrosoft,IjoinedAccelPartners,aleadingVCfirm  
which invests in technology startups. I listened to hundreds of pitches  
from would-be entrepreneurs and was astonished how many didn’t  
have technology or product leaders on their founding teams. Many **352** EMPOWERED  
said they planned to outsource product development, which clearly  
demonstrated a profound failure in their understanding of how great,  
technology-powered products and businesses are built.  
I have spent the last 10 years on the boards of a wide variety of  
organizations, many of them on journeys of “digital transformation.”  
Theoutcomeofthisendeavorhastobethedeliveryofcompelling  
digitalexperiencesforcustomers,andthisrequiresempoweredproduct  
teams.  
To create the conditions for this, leaders need to establish and  
communicate a clear and compelling purpose and vision—what the  
organization is trying to achieve and why. There needs to be obses-  
sion with the customer from the top—who they are, what they want,  
and how they behave.  
And to develop the solution, there need to be highly-focused  
and effective cross-functional teams led by a capable product man-  
ager, empowered to deliver on the product vision. And this means  
clear objectives, accountability, constant interaction, and continuous  
learning.  
Leaders need to set the expectations, establish the governance  
that acknowledges necessary boundaries—but removes barriers  
to progress—and support the teams with the necessary tools and  
resources.And then they need to get out of the way. Seniorleadership  
support for the adoption of these working methods, values, and  
behaviors is key.  
Marty asked me why I thought so many companies still prefer  
command-and-control-style leadership versus empowerment.  
Idon’tknowifit’sapreferenceorevenconscious;inmanycasesit

deal of frustration, which inevitably means that the necessary digital

# IX  
# Business  
# Collaboration  
**H**aving strong product leaders and empowered product teams is  
necessary, but it’s usually not sufficient.  
That’s because product work happens in the context of the  
broader company. Your CEO matters, as do the rest of your key  
executives and the various stakeholders representing other key areas  
of your business.  
However, establishing the necessary working relationships with  
the rest of your business is a different level of hard. It requires a lot  
more sensitivity and nuance.  
Realize that your company is currently used to feature teams that  
exist very clearly to serve the business, and now you’re trying to replace  
themwithempoweredproductteamsthatexistto serve our customers, in  
ways that work for the business.  
What this really means in practice is that you need to move your  
product organization from a subservient model to a collaborative model.  
**355** **356** EMPOWERED  
At a very human level, you’re asking very senior executives  
to think differently about teams comprised of ordinary people—  
individual contributors—who have been coached into extraordinary  
teams.  
This is a very significant change, especially as it impacts the rest  
of your business. We need to discuss the implications of this change  
and how you, as a product leader, can guide your company through  
this change in mindset and responsibilities. **CHAPTER**  
# 71  
# The Role of Product  
# Leaders  
**M**ovingtheproductteamsfromthesubservient featureteammodel  
to the collaborative empoweredproductteam model begins with  
trust—especially between the product organization and the rest of the  
leadersofthebusiness.Andthekeystothattrustaretheproduct leaders,  
especially the head of product.  
Without a strong head of product who inspires confidence and is  
trusted by the CEO and the other key executives, it will be a long and  
very difficult road.  
Note that there is a big assumption here, which may not be true  
inyourorganization\:Weassumethattheproductleadersaregenerally  
at the same peer level with the other key executives and stakeholders  
in the organization.  
Normally, in a tech-powered product company, they are.  
However, in some older, pre-internet companies, the product leaders  
**357** **358** EMPOWERED  
are buried under someone like a CIO, CTO, or inside of individual  
businesses \(all clear signs of the subservient feature team model\).  
In this case, it is politically much more difficult to get the senior  
vice president of sales or the chief marketing officer or the chief  
financial officer to have a collaborative relationship with the head of  
product.  
Whyisthisimportant?Becauseit’smucheasiertogetanexecutive  
toputtheirtrustinapeerratherthaninamuchlower-levelsubordin-  
ate they don’t know, and don’t believe has the necessary experience or  
knowledge.  
In any case, the product leaders must establish a direct relation-  
ship with the CEO \(or general manager in a very large company\) and  
the other key executives. That’s usually the heads of sales, marketing,  
service, finance, legal, and business development. But this list varies at  
each company.  
Thebasisofthisrelationshipisthattheexecutivesneedtobelieve  
the product leaders have a deep understanding of the business and are  
committed to ensuring that the solutions provided will work for the  
various aspects of the business.  
Thisistablestakesfortheproductleaders.Beyondthat,thereare  
three aspects the product leaders will be judged on\:  
1\. Business results  
2\. Product strategy  
3\. Product teams  
# Business Results  
Ultimately,theonlythingthatwilltrulymotivateacompanytochange  
to the empowered team model is results—business results.  
Thereasonthecompanyevenbeganonthisjourneyisverylikely  
because the old way was not delivering the necessary results. So it’s  
important that the product organization deliver the results. And to  
do that, it’s important that the organization have an intentional and  
focused product strategy, and that the product teams are empowered  
and accountable to the results. The Role of Product Leaders **359**  
# Product Strategy  
Rememberthat,withfeatureteams,therereallywasn’taproductstrat-  
egy other than trying to meet the needs of the different parts of the  
business.  
Now, the company has a product strategy, and it’s important that  
thisstrategybesharedwiththeexecutivesbecausethatwillcommuni-  
catethereasonforthefocus,andforthedecisionsonwhattoworkon.  
Note that it’s common that one or more of the most important  
insights were first discovered by one of the key executives or stake-  
holders, and in such cases, it’s important to be generous in crediting  
the source of that insight. You want to build a culture that encourages  
the constant seeking and leveraging of these insights.  
# Product Teams  
Companies in the empowered product team model quickly learn that  
the real work occurs in these product teams, and their ability to solve  
hard problems for the business depends very much on the people on  
theteam,especiallytheproductmanager.Sobeawarethattheywillbe  
judging the product managers and, indirectly, the product leaders.  
I like to tell product leaders that they are only as strong as their  
weakest product manager, and this is why.  
Thisisalsowhyit’ssoimportantduringnew-employeeonboard-  
ing that the manager make sure that the new employee \(this mostly  
pertains to new product managers\) has done her homework and truly  
understands the customers and the business before she interacts with  
thekeyexecutiveorstakeholder.Withoutthisdeepknowledgeofcus-  
tomers, there will be no trust.  
Then, the product leader should personally introduce the new  
employee to the key executive. Realize that when you do this, you  
are personally vouching for their knowledge and ability, so you are  
acknowledging that your reputation is also on the line.  
Asyoucansee,everythingridesonhavingstrongproductleaders.  
Pleasedon’tmakethemistakeof puttingsomeonewho’snotequipped

# 72  
# Stakeholder Management  
# vs. Collaboration  
**Y**ou might have noticed that we have not talked much about the  
topic of “stakeholder management” in this book. That’s because  
thistermrepresentsamindsetthatismoreoftenatraitoffeatureteams  
and less so for empowered product teams.  
Now, don’t misunderstand this. I’m not saying that empowered  
product teams don’t have to pay attention to stakeholders. I’m saying  
that it’s a different relationship.  
Recallthatinfeatureteams,theyaretheretoserve the business,and  
usually “the business” is represented by one or more stakeholders that  
must be “managed” so that the team does not get overwhelmed with  
demands and requests.  
For most feature teams, the most dreaded aspect of the product  
manager role is dealing with the stakeholders. The product managers  
offeatureteamsfeelliketheycannevermakeallthevariousstakehold-  
ers happy. There simply is not enough time, or enough people, and  
sometimes the requests from the stakeholders don’t even make sense.  
**360** Stakeholder Management vs. Collaboration **361**  
Again, I’m not suggesting that empowered product teams can or  
should ignore these stakeholders, but they do have a fundamentally  
different relationship—one that I find is much more constructive and  
conducive to innovation.  
In an empowered product team, the team is there to serve cus-  
tomers, with products that customers love, yet work for the business. The  
stakeholdersarepartnersweneedtocollaboratewithtocomeupwith  
solutions that work \(specifically, that means the solutions are valuable,  
usable,feasible,andviable\).Inparticular,thestakeholdershelpuswith  
viability.  
For example, we may need to sit down with a company lawyer  
to discuss legal constraints and the various ways we might be able to  
addressthem.Weknowthat,nomatterhowmuchthecustomermight  
love a solution, if it’s not legal, it’s a nonstarter.  
Rather than the stakeholder being “the client” that tells us what  
to build, and as such needs to “be managed,” now we have a partner  
that we need to help understand the constraints so we can discover a  
solution that works.  
# The Agency Model  
An agency—whether a design agency or a development agency—is  
there to provide you with design services or development services,  
respectively.  
You may not have thought about things this way, but a feature  
teamisreallyverysimilartotheagencymodel.Themaindifferenceis  
that a feature team is insourced, and the agency model is outsourced.  
Theseagenciesgenerallydon’thavepeoplewiththetitle“prod-  
uctmanager,”buttheydohave“engagementmanagers”thatarethere  
to “manage the relationship with the client” \(in most cases, the very  
same stakeholders that a feature team is there to serve\).  
Anditshouldbenosurprisethatcompaniesthatuseagenciesfor  
design and development have much the same problems as they have  
with feature teams.  
Inthiscase,thepeopleattheagencydon’tjustfeel likemercen-  
aries, they literally are mercenaries.

Aswithfeatureteams,inmyexperience,thepeopleattheagen-

is that, if they don’t want to build the feature “the client” tells them  
to, then the client will simply go to another agency that will.  
There are a few agencies that are trying to provide the services  
of true empowered product teams to their clients, and I applaud that  
trend.But,unfortunately,thisdependsontheclienthavinganunusu-  
ally high level of trust in that agency.  
One other observation\: You can often find exceptionally good  
people to hire from design and development agencies because the  
people have been exposed to so many types of products.  
However, realize that moving to an empowered product team  
willbeamajorculturalchange.Inmanycases,thepeoplefromagen-

point. **CHAPTER**

We are also constantly seeking these insights from others across

**363** **364** EMPOWERED  
As we learn important or potentially relevant insights, we want  
to share these learnings with our colleagues from across the business.  
There are several reasons for this\:  
First, the insight may help them as well.  
Second, they may have additional insights while viewing the data  
through their lens.  
Third, they may be able to help us explain the dynamics in order  
to better leverage the insights.  
Fourth, it is important that the company learn the difference  
between a prototype getting a bad response during discovery, and a  
product failing in the market.  
“Failing”indiscoveryisnotreallyfailing—itisveryfastandinex-

# Keeping the Lights On  
**M**ost of this book is about how strong teams solve hard problems  
in ways that our customers love, yet work for the business.  
However, it’s also true that every team must do some amount of  
“keep-the-lights-on” work.  
Whenyou’retryingtorunabusiness,youwillalwayshavecertain  
work that is nonnegotiable if you wish to stay in business. Common  
examples include\:  
• Fixing critical bugs  
• Addressing compliance issues \(such as a new law relating to pri-  
vacy\)  
• Incorporatingminorchangestohandlechangingreportingneeds  
• Adding instrumentation for collecting usage analytics  
None of these are glamorous, but usually they are relatively  
minor.  
You might address these items for your own purposes \(e.g., fix-  
ing critical bugs or analytics instrumentation\), or you might address  
**365** **366** EMPOWERED  
requests from someone like your legal officer \(e.g., new compliance  
issue\) or your finance partner \(e.g., a reporting need\).  
The product manager is typically the person responsible for  
understanding these keep-the-lights-on items, collecting whatever  
data is necessary and putting the work on the backlog. As a general  
rule, we don’t need to do product discovery on any of these items. If  
we do, then we would consider it more-normal product work.  
So, how does this relate to business collaboration?  
Thesourceofthesekeep-the-lights-onitemsisoftenoneormore  
of our business partners. They might not know the best way to satisfy  
theneed,buttheyareusuallyacutelyawareoftheneedandcanprovide  
anynecessarycontext.Ifaproductteamcan’thandletheseissues,then

Moregenerally,it’snormalforbusinessownersandkeystakehold-  
ers to spot new opportunities—new ways to monetize, new services,  
new capabilities. And if you have a good relationship, they will bring  
these opportunities to you.  
This is where it’s critical to be able to constantly remind your  
business partners about \(and evangelize, which is discussed below\) the  
product strategy and the importance of focus. In most cases, they are

# Evangelism  
**O**ne of the critical roles of strong product leaders—especially in  
medium- to large-sized companies—is evangelism.  
Evangelism in this context means marketing to your own organ-  
ization \(e.g., product marketing, marketing, and sales\).  
Inthiscase,you’renottryingtogetpeopletobuy.Youareinstead  
trying to persuade them that this is going to be very important and  
something they should care about and contribute to making a reality.  
There are many techniques to help communicate the value of  
what you’re proposing to your product teams, executives, key stake-  
holders, and investors. Here are my top-10 techniques\:  
1\. Use prototypes. For so many people, PowerPoint presentations  
justdon’tcutit.Showthemaprototype.Itwillprobablyneedto  
beahigh-fidelityprototype,whichmeansthatitwouldlookreal-  
istic, even though it’s just a mirage. This is probably the single  
most effective technique for persuasion of a product idea.  
**367** **368** EMPOWERED  
2\. Sharethepain.Showthecustomerpainyouareaddressing.You  
can share quotes or even put together a video montage. This is  
also why I love to bring developers or executives along to user  
testing.Forsomanypeople,theyjusthavetohearthecustomer’s  
words and witness their pain themselves to get it.  
3\. Share the vision. People don’t just want to know what you’re  
doing today—they want to know where you are heading. The  
product vision shows where you hope to be in 3–10 years.  
4\. Share the learnings. As discussed earlier, when your teams are  
doing product discovery work every week, you will have signif-  
icant learnings and insights from the data and from users and  
customers,onafairlyfrequentbasis.Sharetheselearnings—not  
just the things that went well but share the problems too. Give  
your audience the information they need to help come up with  
the solution.  
5\. Sharecreditgenerously.Makesuretheteam,theexecutives,and  
the key stakeholders view the product as their product, not just  
your product. On the other hand, when things don’t go well,  
step forward and take responsibility for the miss, and show the  
peopleyou’relearningfromthemistakesaswell.They’llrespect  
you for it.  
6\. Learn how to give a great demo. Especially for your executives  
and your stakeholders, we’re not trying to teach them how to  
operate the product, and we’re not trying to test whether they  
could use the product. We’re trying to show them the value.  
A demo is not training, and it’s not a test—it’s a form of sales.  
Get good at it.  
7\. Doyourhomework.Yourteam,yourexecutives,andyourstake-  
holderswillallbemuchmorelikelytofollowyouiftheybelieve  
you know what you’re talking about. Be an expert on your users  
and customers, your data, your business, and your market.  
8\. Be genuinely excited. If you’re not excited about your products,  
you should probably fix that either by changing what you work  
on or changing your role. Evangelism **369**  
9\. Learn to show some enthusiasm. Assuming you’re genuinely  
excited,it’samazingtomehowmanyproductleadersaresobad  
and/or so uncomfortable at showing enthusiasm. This matters.  
Absolutely be sincere but let people see you’re genuinely  
excited. Enthusiasm really is contagious.  
10\. Spend time with the product teams. If you’re not spending face  
time with every product manager, product designer, and devel-  
oper on your team, then they can’t see the enthusiasm in your  
eyes.Spendingafewminuteswitheverylastpersonontheprod-  
uctteamspaysoffbigintheirlevelofmotivation.It’sworthyour  
time.  
Note that evangelism can never really stop. As soon as you do,  
things will start to go sideways. Executives will get cold feet. Your  
engineers will start claiming they don’t know why they’re working on  
something.It’sremarkablehowquicklythishappensifyouthinkpeople  
have already heard this stuff and it’s no longer needed.  
Experienced product leaders know that you can never evange-  
lize too much. You can change up the technique, vary the customers

needs to be a constant. **CHAPTER**

# Leader Profile\:  
# Avid Larizadeh Duggan  
# Path to Leadership  
I first met Avid back in 2001, when I  
was running product at eBay. I received  
a call from a friend I had worked with at  
Netscape,andhetoldmejusttotrusthim  
and hire this person because he was sure  
she would become an exceptional product  
person. I did trust him, and he was right.  
Avid studied engineering but wanted  
to learn product. After rising through  
the product organization at eBay, she decided to get her MBA at Har-  
vard. Afterward, she went back and forth between the venture capital  
world—mostly at Google Ventures—and leading tech product com-  
panies, most recently at Kobalt Music.  
**370** Leader Profile\: *Avid Larizadeh Duggan* **371**  
Along the way, she’s invested and advised several strong product  
companies,andhasbeenaleaderforCode.org\(theorganizationhelp-  
ing women and minorities learn to code\).  
Because of her contributions to technology and beyond, she was  
recently awarded the Order of the British Empire \(OBE\).  
# Leadership in Action  
Avid’s own words follow.  
Myleadershipphilosophyinaninnovation-drivencontextcanbe

and autonomy, and \(3\) culture and purpose.  
# Trust and Safety  
Aleaderisnotsupposedtohavealltheanswers,butissupposedtoask  
therightquestions,andmoreimportant,createanenvironmentwhere  
the right questions are surfaced.  
To do so, a leader needs to make her team feel safe. In this envir-  
onment, no one is smarter than everyone else, trust is established,  
collaboration is natural, and conflicting ideas are frequent and  
comfortable because it is safe to be candid.  
Teams must feel safe disagreeing with their peers and with their  
leaders.Itisanenvironmentwherepeopledon’tfearfailurebecauseit  
ispartoftheprocessof iteration.That’s howgoodideasbecomegreat  
ideas.  
It is an environment which celebrates a growth mindset rather  
than success at a point in time, encourages continuous learning, and  
rejects the know-it-alls. By bringing out the best in your teammates,  
you find the best in yourself.  
# Freedom and Autonomy  
In a digital world where innovation is key, where data is flowing freely  
both inside and outside the company, and where change is constant, **372** EMPOWERED  
work has become increasingly complex, changeable, and informal in  
nature.  
As a result, an organization needs to get rid of its traditional  
hierarchy—which mainly promotes people having interactions with  
others in their own department—in favor of a system which encour-  
ages input and collaboration from people with different skill sets  
acrossfunctionsinternallyandexternallywithpartnersandcustomers.  
Therefore, leaders need to focus on bringing strong people  
together and giving them greater freedom to generate ideas and  
execute them through collaboration.  
A leader should articulate what needs to be done and why, and  
then let the team decide how to do it.  
Shewillsetthingsinmotion,guideherteam,andcleartheobsta-  
cles when the team is in trouble.  
This has similarities with the role of a product manager. She will  
havetoworkcross-functionallywithteammatesandstakeholders,lead,  
influence,motivate,andtrustthem—withouteverorderingthemtodo  
anything.  
She will ensure they are motivated and know what their purpose  
is. She will coach them and help them develop in a safe environment.  
She will connect the dots internally and externally to empower her  
team with additional information, better tools, and efficiency.  
She will ensure that they have the data they need to experiment  
anditeratequickly,aswellastheautonomytomakeinformeddecisions  
based on their learning. She will clarify the chaos in a world where  
change is a constant.  
# Culture and Purpose  
Good leaders focus on culture and purpose because culture drives  
innovation and performance. The greatest capital of an organization  
is its people.  
To innovate, people need autonomy and meaning. It is crucial  
that a leader define what the purpose is to make sure that every-  
one inside and outside the organization—including customers and  
partners—knows what they are doing to promote it.

Innovation in Established Companies. I have applied these principles in  
startups and established companies. The latter are much more chal-  
lenging because they often are no longer the innovators.  
They struggle with legacy technology and complex processes,  
whileoftencomplacentinthebeliefthattheirleadingmarketposition  
issecurebecausetheyhavebeeninthatpositionforalongtime.They  
overestimate the speed at which they are able to innovate.  
Thisiswheretheroleofleadersbecomesextremelyimportantto  
the survival of the company.  
Unlesstheseniorleadersunderstandthetruenatureandurgency  
of the threat, they will not be willing to put the organization through  
thestressofchange,despiteitsnecessity—especiallyifthatwouldcause  
a short-term impact to profitability.  
This is because consistent innovation in established companies  
requiresradicalchangesinthewayteamswork,thetechnologiesused,  
the skill sets required, the culture of the company, and as a result, the  
mindset of the leaders.  
Theyneedtoputtheprinciplesdescribedaboveinpractice,start-  
ing with trust. Once the teams trust their leaders, they will be more  
willingtomakechange,astheywon’tfeartherepercussionsofnotget-  
ting it right the first time.  
This trust needs to go both ways, and leaders need to empower  
their teams to be autonomous, as most innovation comes from those  
on the frontline and not from the executives or the board.  
And, critically, the teams need to understand why they are going  
through the upheaval of change and to what end and purpose. They  
need to be motivated by something larger than themselves.  
Once an established company comes to realize that its future  
dependsonsignificantandongoinginnovation,anditdoesnotbelieve  
it has the muscles for this today, then there are really two options\: the  
company can either innovate through acquisition, or it can learn to  
innovate through its own people.  
To innovate through its own people requires the change to skills,  
culture, methods, and leadership that we’ve been talking about. And, **374** EMPOWERED  
yes, this is hard, takes time, significant investment, and focused com-  
mitment.  
So for many established companies—especially legacy com-  
panies—they often believe it is easier to innovate through acquisition.  
The challenge is that, in order to realize the benefits of these  
acquisitions, this often requires integrating the acquisitions deeply  
into the workings of the parent company. And if that parent company  
does not make most of the same changes to their leadership, culture,  
skills, and empowerment, they would need to innovate through their  
ownpeople,theacquiredteamsthatwerebehindtheinnovationleave,  
the innovative products decline, the happy customers are no longer so  
happy, and the company is back to where it started.  
ThisiswhyIspendsomuchofmytimeandeffortshelpingleaders

# and Transformed  
Great teams are made up of ordinary people who are inspired and  
empowered.  
**T**hey are inspired with ideas and techniques for quickly evaluating  
those ideas to discover solutions that work—that are valuable,  
usable, feasible, and viable.  
They are empowered to solve hard problems in ways their cus-  
tomers love, yet work for their business.  
Empowered teams that produce extraordinary results don’t  
require exceptional hires.  
They do require people who are competent and of character so  
they can establish the necessary trust with their teammates and with  
the rest of the company.  
**375** **376** EMPOWERED  
Truly empowered teams also need the strategic context that comes  
from the product leadership—especially the product vision and the  
product strategy—and the active support of their management, primar-  
ily with ongoing coaching.  
There are never guarantees for innovation, but we can substan-  
tially improve our odds. **CHAPTER**

# Transformation

workthewaythebestcompanieswork,itraisesthequestionofhow  
to change from the way you’re working today to the way you believe  
youneedtoworktomorrow.Andthisisessentiallyaquestionoftrans-  
formation.  
What does it really mean to transform to empowered product  
teams?  
The prerequisite for this transformation is getting your senior  
leaders—typically starting with the CEO—to understand the neces-  
sary role of technology as the key enabler of the business, and not just  
a necessary cost of doing business. Without this understanding, your  
chances of success are low.  
But assuming your senior leadership understands why this is  
essential, and is willing to take the actions required, then we can get  
to work.  
**377** **378** EMPOWERED  
At the highest level, there are three major steps. And as a general  
rule, they need to happen in the following order.  
First,you’llneedtoensureyouhavestrongproductleadersinplace.  
Withoutthis,youwon’tbeabletorecruitandcoachthenecessarystaff  
fortheproductteams,youwon’thaveasolidproductstrategy,andyou  
won’tearnthetrustoftheleadersandthestakeholders.Sothisisreally  
thefirstandmostcriticalstep,whichiswhyithasbeenthemaintopic  
of this book.  
Second,you’llneedtogivethosestrongproductleaderstheability  
to recruit and develop the staff required for empowered product teams.  
This almost always means raising the bar on the product managers,  
but it may go well beyond that. Note that you don’t need to up-level  
all teams at once. You just need to be sure that, before you empower  
a given product team, you have ensured that the team is staffed with  
people who are up to the task.  
Third, for the product teams that are ready to operate in the  
empowered product team model, you will need to redefinetherelation-  
shipwiththebusiness. Recall that, in the feature team model, the stake-  
holders were largely in control, and the feature teams were set up to  
besubservienttothebusiness.Now,withtheempoweredproductteam  
model, the idea is to be truepartnerswith the business—collaborating  
to come up with solutions that customers love, yet also work for the  
business.  
Please remember that this change represents a bit of a give and  
take with the leaders in the organization. Realize you’re asking them  
to take a pretty big leap of faith. What’s in it for them is that the old  
way of working has never been very effective, so most are willing to at  
least give it a try.  
Especially for larger organizations, there’s of course much more  
to be said about how this transformation impacts finance, HR, sales,  
marketing, and nearly every other aspect of the business, but that’s a  
subject for another book.  
# The Cost of Transformation  
One of the great ironies of this entire topic of empowered product  
teams vs. feature teams is that, in general, it costs significantly less to Meaningful Transformation **379**  
staff and fund empowered product teams than it does to fund feature  
teams.  
In fact, I have never seen more waste than I find in large com-  
paniesthatarerunningfeatureteams.Thisisespeciallythecasewhen  
thatcompany hasoutsourcedsignificantpartsoftheirengineeringto  
one of the big firms.  
Itisnotunusualtofindtheselarge,oldcompanieswithliterally  
thousands of outsourced engineers funded by annual contracts in the  
tens of millions of dollars. This is the literal definition of mercenary  
teams.  
The company often thinks they’re saving money because they  
look at the loaded cost of an engineer, not realizing that they need  
many more engineers, as well as the many people to manage these  
large numbers of engineers.  
Yet a much smaller team of true missionaries will typically  
dramatically outperform this much larger and much more expensive  
approach.  
Evenbeyondthecostsavings,innovationalmostneverhappens  
in the outsourced model, and your company’s future depends on  
innovation.  
Itistruethatwewilltypicallypaymoreperpersonforthehigher  
level of talent that we require in an empowered product team, but  
the number of people will be substantially less and the overhead of  
managing them will be dramatically less.  
IhavemetmorethanafewCFOsthatareskepticalofthisargu-  
ment, so I simply suggest that they run a test. I suggest they pick an  
area of the business, and for the next several quarters compare the  
costs and the business results of the empowered product team model  
against their current model. **CHAPTER**

# Transformation  
# in Action  
***N***ow that we’ve discussed what’s involved in meaningful transformation,  
you might be wondering what a strong product organization looks like  
that has undergone this transformation.  
To answer that, I am sharing below a story from SVPG partner Jon  
Moore, which is based on his experiences at the Guardian in London, which  
was one of the most impressive transformations I have witnessed.  
InJune2007,theworldoftechnologychangedforever.SteveJobs  
stood on stage and unveiled the iPhone—a device that was limited in  
functionalitybutrichinintuition.Itwasatimeofrevolutionarychange  
forallbusinesses,andnonemoresothantheUK’sGuardian newspaper.  
Underthestewardshipofthen-editor-in-chiefAlanRusbridger,itwas  
arguably the most digitally ambitious newspaper in the world.  
But it was also in crisis. For the first time in nearly 200 years,  
the Guardian’s future was anything but guaranteed. Advertising was in  
freefall, and virtually all other revenue streams were in the process of  
being replaced by newer, better, digital-first rivals.  
**380** Transformation in Action **381**  
As newspapers all over the world began the task of moving to  
online subscription models, the Guardian chose an alternative, ambi-  
tiousbutpotentiallyperilousstrategy\:toremainfreeonline.“Nothing  
goodevercomesofputtingupawall”wasthemessagedeliveredacross  
the organization.  
ThedecisionwasfoundedonabeliefthattheGuardian’sprogres-  
sive editorial content would wither and die behind a paywall—even  
if it meant considerably shortening our runway, as paying newspaper  
customers switched to free online content. It was a decision of some  
consequence and one I backed wholeheartedly, believing that a pro-  
gressivebutsmallechochamberwasnevergoingtochangetheworld.  
Reach first, revenue later.  
ItwasintothisenvironmentthatIjoinedoneofthemostimpres-  
sive product and technology organizations anywhere in traditional  
media. Many of my new colleagues had chosen to leave ambitious  
startups, Google, or Microsoft, and like me, had also experienced  
success at scaling other well-known media organizations. All shared  
a deep desire to ensure the longevity of one of the most exciting and  
important media brands in the world.  
But this rapid influx of smart technologists also created cultural  
chaos.  
The Guardian’s long-standing identity as a newspaper was under  
threat, and like many organizations in rapid transition, the working  
environment was at best confused and often fractious.  
Many long-serving journalists and editorial staff were under-  
standablyuncertainoftheirnewcolleagues.Ourwaysofworkingwere  
alien,ourdesiretocreatechangewasthreatening,andalthoughitwas  
not always publicly acknowledged, our motivations were frequently  
questioned.  
I had been tasked with creating and executing an immediate  
mobile strategy. It was a superb challenge at an exciting time. Our  
then-digital director, Mike Bracken \(who went on to substantially  
advance product management within UK government circles\) had  
created a team of significant talent.  
On entry, I had spearheaded the organization’s first iPhone app,  
liaising closely with Apple. Our small team worked hard to ensure we  
madethemostofthethen-revolutionarytouchscreensand,becauseof  
that, I paid special attention to photography from the outset. **382** EMPOWERED  
Our innovative iPhone-based technology immediately down-  
loaded the most important and popular content without request on  
app opening. I wanted our app to always be useful, even when signal  
strengthwaspoororabsent\(asitfrequentlywasin2007\).Thisfeature  
alone proved a revelation to many.  
From the moment we hit the App Store, it was a success. We  
receivedhundredsofthousandsofdownloadsoverthenextfewweeks,  
and in time, many millions more. A significant proportion were from  
new international customers, fueled by the global reach of Apple’s  
newecosystem.Ourapplicationquality,combinedwiththeGuardian’s  
world-class journalism, shone through in customer feedback. And  
becauseofthat,Applewashappytoshowcaseusinmultiple,consistent  
marketing campaigns—both local and global—many above the fold.  
While most of the competition had launched apps that were at  
heartessentiallyadvancedRSSreaders,wehadworkedhardtoembrace  
the myriad new possibilities of the touchscreen form. For Apple, it’s  
never been enough to just get involved. What they really look for are  
partners who appreciate their tools sufficiently to push the actual cus-  
tomer experience forward.  
In parallel to operational delivery, as the lead PM, it was clear to  
methattobetrulysuccessful,I wasgoingtoneedtobridgeagrowing  
divide between the editorial and technology teams.  
Evangelizing is never more important than when your integrity  
and motivation are in question. But virtually anything worth doing in  
technology will usually strongly challenge the status quo, and this was  
no different.  
In countless meetings and showcases with senior editorial  
managers, over many months, I communicated my strong belief that,  
if successful, my role would essentially create “more eyeballs for  
your amazing content, and more eyeballs for us to monetize.” My  
job was to gain maximum reach from the emerging new distribution  
channels.  
To do that, I believed I needed to build a world-class product  
within which to showcase the unquestionable world-class content.  
Having established some success early in my tenure, it was then  
that the technology world shifted again. Toward the end of January  
2010, Steve Jobs confirmed one of the worst-kept secrets in tech by  
formally announcing Apple’s new tablet\: the iPad. Transformation in Action **383**  
Thenextday,IreceivedaphonecallfromCupertino.“Steveloved  
what you guys did with the iPhone,” I was told. “We’d like you to  
replicate it for the iPad. And by the way, he’s planning to showcase  
his favorite apps on stage at the public launch.”  
Clearly that was great news, but then came the curveball\: “We  
need the app submitted by the last week in March.” That gave us a  
little over seven weeks to submit our app for final review.  
Thiswasamajorproblem.Wehadaddedsignificantlymorefunc-  
tionality than most and designed our product bottom up. And not all  
of it was portable, even to an iPad.  
Fromtheget-go,ourbiggestriskwasfeasibility.Afteradayortwo  
of intensive discovery work, it was clear that achieving the same level  
ofexcellencewasgoingtobeimpossible.Wejustdidn’thavesufficient  
time. With quality sacrosanct, we needed another product—and fast.  
I knew exactly where to look. I’d previouslymade the decision to  
put photography front and center in our iPhone launch. It was imme-  
diately apparent these new touchscreen devices were also the world’s  
most impressive \(and expensive\) digital frames. The qualitative and  
quantitative data proved that decision to be a good one.  
Our photography content was consistently among the most pop-  
ular,helpedtodrivestrongfrequency,andresultedinconsistentlypos-  
itive customer feedback.  
There was no more time to collect further evidence. Our new  
productwouldfocusspecificallyonnewsphotography,andgiventime-

uct team \(five people\: product, design, and three engineers\).  
Ihadtoensurewewerefocusedonwhatcouldbebuiltasquickly  
as possible. We would then rely on rapid iteration to make it as good  
as possible.  
The concept moved from whiteboard to customer prototype in  
days. We would deliver a single, curated photo per day that commu-  
nicated an important world event. We’d include a few other details,  
but only a few—highlighting the story behind the photo and how it  
was shot.  
The inclusion of the latter allowed us to gain an impressive  
sponsorship, proving early that we were capable of achieving revenue  
gains. The photos would build, over time, into a stunning library of **384** EMPOWERED  
the world’smost arrestingphotographs. If we got it right, I figured we  
could create the world’s first and best digital “coffee table” app.  
I needed to befriend the Guardian’s photography team, then led  
by a fabulous craftsman, Roger Tooth. He was incredibly patient and  
verywillingtodevotetimeandresourcestoaprojectthathadalimited  
chance of success.  
With so little time, things moved quickly. While my designer  
andIfocusedoniteratingourprototype,ourthree-personengineering

the systems and services to ensure consistent content delivery.

incredibly quickly.  
With value, feasibility, and usability starting to work their way  
down my list of risks, there was one area remaining that worried me  
significantly\: business viability.  
Uptothatpoint,veryfewoftheseniorstakeholdershadhadmuch

apology later.  
WithaproductnowinlatebuildthatIwasincreasinglyconfident  
of, the time to make those apologies had arrived. In truth, although  
Alan was almost certainly concerned that I had failed to involve more  
senior editorial figures, he didn’t waver in his support once he’d seen  
the prototype.  
I also had very strong advocates in the photography team. I had  
been so impressed with how passionately and knowledgeably Roger  
talked about his art. I’d even baked a short video of him into the app.

she was then \(and remains\) a fabulous external mentor for me. With  
my showcase over, she immediately responded with words that set the  
tone for approval\: “Truly excellent, it looks amazing and how did you  
manage to move so fast?” With those words out on the table, the rest  
of the meeting went smoothly. We submitted the app for approval the  
next day.  
As expected, I heard nothing back from Apple \(a conversation  
withthemcanoftenfeellikeshoutingintoadarkalley\).ButwhenSteve  
tookthestagetwoweekslater,herapidlygottohisfavoriteiPadapps.  
He skipped over many well-known U.S. brands.  
“We’vegotalotofnewsapps”hesaid,“theNew York Times,Time  
magazine, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today.” But then he paused,  
took a step back, and turned to look at the huge image of Guardian  
Eyewitness that had appeared on stage. “This is a cool app,” he con-  
tinued,“GuardianEyewitness.Ratherthantext,thisgivesyoutheday  
in pictures. And it’s really nice.”  
Virtually anyone who cared about technology was watching that  
broadcast, which was a pretty big audience. The resulting usage fol-  
lowedasimilarpathtotheiPhonelaunch,andalthoughsmallerdueto  
fewer base hardware sales, in many ways it was improved.  
Duetothenatureofthecontent\(stunning,family-friendlyphoto-  
graphs\), we had also unwittingly created arguably the perfect app to  
showcase the iPad’s then-revolutionary screen technology. As a result,  
Apple was even more industrious in their use of our app in virtually  
all early iPad marketing campaigns. And for the best part of a year,  
we tracked close to a 1\:1 relationship between unique iPad sales and  
unique Eyewitness usage.  
We had proven that quality photojournalism—combined with  
an innovative and immersive digital experience—resulted in millions  
of new Guardian consumers. But perhaps more important, we had  
demonstrated that the Guardian could lead the world, not just editor-  
ially but digitally. The Guardian is now close to being consistently

# TRANSFORMED  
***S***VPG Partner Lea Hickman is publishing another book in the SVPG  
series, TRANSFORMED, and her book tackles the very difficult but  
criticallyimportanttopicoftransformation.Below,Leaexplainshermotiva-  
tionforwritingthebookandthetopicssheaddressesinit.  
Therearemanybooksondigitaltransformations,andevenmore  
organizations that have tried and failed to meaningfully transform.  
Why is this book any different, and why should you expect to be  
any more successful after reading it?  
Fromworkingwithmanycompanies,andfromexperiencingfirst-  
hand at Adobe one of the most noted and financially successful trans-  
formations in technology history, I can tell you that not all companies  
are fully vested in their transformations. In fact, most aren’t willing to  
make the changes that are necessary.  
Most organizations focus their transformation narrowly on how  
they develop products, rather than broadly on how they produce and  
deliver value to their customers. They think they can silo off some  
“digital transformation” group or have their developers adopt Agile  
methods.  
**386** *TRANSFORMED* **387**  
Let me give you an example. When I joined the Silicon Valley  
Product Group after building products for more than 25 years, it was  
very eye-openingto work with multipleproduct organizationsaround  
the world and see the different patterns of behavior.  
Insomecases,Iwouldbeworkingwithworld-classproductlead-  
erswhounderstoodhowtogettheproductorganizationoperatingina  
waythatwouldyieldrealresults.Theirleaderswereabletolead,man-  
age,andcoachtheproductorganization,andtopartnereffectivelywith  
their colleagues across the company.  
However, in other organizations, the product leaders—while  
they perhaps knew the mechanics of product—didn’t have the ability  
to build the teams they needed to deliver the necessary results, and  
to influence the rest of the organization. They were viewed mainly as  
the technology team, and thought of as a necessary \(or, sometimes,  
not-so-necessary\) expense.  
The most difficult part of these engagements is that I could pre-  
dictwhatwaslikelytohappen.Yes,theywouldimproveincrementally,  
butthefullpotentialwouldn’tberealized.Fortheseorganizations,they  
needed more fundamental changes.  
If a company wants to raise the bar for the product organization,  
they need to think differently about product.  
Instead of looking at product as just a part of the technology  
organization\(orworse,theITorganization\),theyneedtothinkabout  
product as theorganization. I am not talking about power structure or  
even org structure. I am talking about how product needs to be the  
valuedriveroftheorganizationasopposedtojustafeaturefactoryfor  
the rest of the organization.  
AsIengagewiththesetypesoforganizations,anotherlessonI’ve  
learned is that, if the executive team isn’t on board with this product  
operating model, the chances of successful transformation are slim.  
I’ve found that it is critically important for the executive team to  
understand,andhavethelanguagetoengagewith,theproductorgan-  
ization.  
There are also key characteristics of the executive leaders that I  
have observed. Certain executives have the skills and personality to  
drive the necessary change, and others don’t. The leader’s behaviors  
can make or break the ability of an organization to transform to a true  
product culture. **388** EMPOWERED  
OneofthethingsIammostproudof,whenIthinkofSiliconVal-  
ley Product Group, is the fact that we operate in the real world. What  
we talk about isn’t academic, and it isn’t theory. We focus on what we  
know works. We have all built products for decades. We have all had  
successesandfailures.Wehavealloperatedasbothindividualcontrib-  
utorsandseniorleadersinorganizations.Wehaveallbeenthroughthe

# The Most Important Thing  
Empowered engineers are the single most important thing that you can  
have in a company.  
—Bill Campbell  
**I**nyourjourneytoempoweredteams,ifIhadtopickjustoneconcept  
from this entire book that I hope you would take to heart, it would  
be the idea of an empowered engineer.  
Certainly,I’mnotsayingthat’sallthat’srequired,asextraordinary  
products come from product teams.ButIamsuggestingIbelievethisisthe  
single most important ingredient.  
I could have framed most of this book around the concept of an  
empowered engineer.  
Ihaveexplainedthatthebestsinglesourceforinnovationisyour  
engineers\(becausethey’reworkingwiththeenablingtechnologyevery  
day, so they’re in the best position to see what’s just now possible\).  
The product vision is intended to attract and inspire these  
engineers.  
**389** **390** EMPOWERED  
The product strategy is intended to ensure these engineers are  
working on the most important problems.  
The team objectives give the engineers clear statements of the  
problem to solve, and the outcomes to strive for.  
The product manager and product designer provide critical  
constraints regarding business viability and customer experience,  
respectively.  
User research and data science provide the engineers with key  
insights.  
Andtobeveryclear,justlettingyourengineersdecidehow to code  
asolutionisnotwhatismeantbyempowerment.Ofcourse,theyneed  
to decide how to implement the solution.  
Lettingyourengineersdetermine the architecture isalsonotwhatis  
meant by empowerment. Of course, they also need to be able to decide  
the architecture.  
Empowermentofanengineermeansthatyouprovidetheengin-  
eers with the problem to solve and the strategic context, and they are able  
to leverage technology to figure out the best solution to the problem.  
Aneasywaytotellwhetherornotyouhaveempoweredengineers  
isifthefirsttimeyourengineersseeaproductideaisatsprintplanning,  
you are clearly a feature team and your engineers are not empowered  
in any meaningful sense.  
If you’re just using your engineers to code, you’re only getting  
about half their value.  
Hopefully, this is obvious at this point in the book, but a strong  
tech-powered product company would no sooner outsource their  
engineers than they would outsource their CEO.  
The best tech companies understand this. They all have  
dual-track career ladders for a reason. Their top engineers are  
generally compensated at the level of a vice president.  
Theengineersaretheeasiestwaytotellifthecompanyhasteams  
of missionaries or teams of mercenaries.  
Note that I’m not suggesting that you put your engineers on a  
pedestal. They are ordinary people like the rest of us. But I am sug-  
gesting that you treat them like the first-class members of the product  
teams they need to be.  
Justconsiderthebreakthroughinnovationsyouuseandloveevery  
day.Oddsarethatinnovationoriginatedfromanempoweredengineer  
working in an empowered team. The Most Important Thing **391**  
Iwillwarnyouthat,intoomanycases,yourproductmanagerswill  
resist this. You will hear\: “My engineers are not interested in anything  
but coding.”  
This is by far the most common excuse from people that don’t  
understand empowered teams. I have heard it countless times, mostly  
whenIaskaproductmanagerorproductdesignerwhytheirengineers  
aren’t participating in the product discovery work.  
The first thing I should acknowledge is that occasionally this is  
true, and I’ll come back to this situation later. But in my experience,  
this is the exception.  
Whenever I hear this objection, I insist on speaking to the  
engineers directly. Much more often than not, this is not at all what  
the engineers say. In fact, the most common complaint I hear from  
the engineers is that they are not included until it’s too late, and they  
are forced to deal with the consequences.  
What’susuallygoingonisthattheproductmanagerdoesn’twant  
the engineers to be included because she would rather the engineers  
spend their time coding. So, in this case, the issue is an overzealous  
product manager—thinking much more like a project manager than a  
productmanager—eitherhearingwhatshewantstohear,ornotcaring  
enough to even ask.  
However, sometimes the engineers do tell me they don’t really  
care much about discovery. They prefer to code and are fine building  
“whatever.” In this case, I ask them to tell me the last time any of the  
engineers were able to personally visit with a customer. The answer is  
usually between “a very long time ago” and “never.”  
But,asIsaidabove,sometimesnotevenasingleoneoftheengin-  
eers has any desire to do anything other than code. In this case, my  
discussionmovestotheheadofengineering,andIexplainthatshehas  
mercenariesandnotmissionaries,andwhysheneedstoraisethebaron  
hiring engineers. At a minimum, she needs at least one true tech lead  
on each product team, and discovery is one of the big responsibilities  
of the tech lead.  
If as a product leader, you do nothing else other than this, you  
will have meaningfully moved forward on your use of technology, on  
your path to empowered product teams, and on giving yourself a real  
chance at continuous innovation. **CHAPTER**

encounter in companies. Now that we’ve discussed the work neces-  
sarytotransform,I’dliketorevisitthislist,thistimewithwhereIhope  
your transformation will take you.  
The Role of Technology  
Your company understands the critical and essential role that technol-  
ogyplaysinenablingyourbusiness,andtheexperienceyouprovideto  
your customers.  
When new technologies emerge that you believe have the poten-  
tial to be relevant, you immediately designate some engineers to learn  
thattechnologyandtoconsiderhowitmaybeabletohelpsolveprob-  
lems for your customers in ways that are just now possible.  
This goes far beyond using technology for operational efficien-  
cies. You understand that technology allows you to reconsider what’s  
possible and reimagine every aspect of your existing business.  
**392** The Destination **393**  
You view your product managers, product designers, engineers,  
and data scientists as absolutely core to your business. You would no  
sooner consider outsourcing them than you would outsource your  
executives.  
Coaching  
You have developed and embraced a culture of coaching. Every single  
member of a product team has at least one manager that is committed  
to helping her reach her potential. You have built a reputation as a  
company where ordinary people who are competent and have good  
charactercandevelopintoamemberofanextraordinaryproductteam.  
Staffing  
Your hiring managers know that they are personally responsible for  
recruiting candidates, ensuring a strong interview and hiring process,  
and then onboarding these new people and ensuring they are success-  
ful. Strong staffing has become a core competency for your managers.  
Product Vision  
You have an inspiring and compelling product vision that unites the  
various product teams from across the organization in a common pur-  
pose that is meaningful to your customers. This vision will likely take  
you between 3 and 10 years to fully realize, but you are consistently  
making progress on this vision, quarter by quarter.  
Team Topology  
You have designed your team topology to optimize for empowerment  
and autonomy. The people on your product teams feel real ownership  
over a meaningful piece of the larger whole, and they understand how  
and when to work with their colleagues on other teams to collaborate  
on larger problems. **394** EMPOWERED  
Product Strategy  
Youareexecutingonaproductstrategythatfocusesonthemostimpor-

Relationship to Business  
Today, the relationship between the product teams and your business  
leaders and stakeholders is one of mutual respect and true collabora-  
tion. The product teams work closely with the stakeholders to come  
up with solutions that customers love, yet work for the business. Both  
the teams and the stakeholders understand and embrace this.

# Final Thoughts  
My deep hope is that the many product leaders out there who were  
never fortunate enough to receive serious coaching will now have a  
resource to help them raise their game—and hence raise the level of  
their people.

So many colleagues in engineering, design, and product showed  
me what it means to work on a strong product team.  
And so many companies have invited me into their offices to sit

This book benefited in particular from the insights of a set  
of proven product leaders and discovery coaches that I admire and  
respect\: Holly Hester-Reilly, Teresa Torres, Gabrielle Buffrem, Petra  
Wille, and Felipe Castro each dedicated real time and effort to help  
me make this book worthy of its subject.  
I would also like to thank the leaders that allowed me to profile  
them in this book. Besides being exceptional leaders, they also have in  
common a desire to shine the light on others rather than on them-  
selves. I’m grateful they agreed to let me provide others a glimpse  
into their leadership style\: Debby Meredith, Audrey Crane, Christina

My point of view on these topics was forged by the leaders at  
Vontu\: Joseph Ansanelli, Michael Wolfe, Doug Camplejohn, Steve  
Roop, John Donnelly, Ken Kim, Margie Mader-Clark, and many  
others. This crew walked the talk and showed me what genuine  
leadership and focus on the team could do. I still remember Michael  
Wolfe telling me, “Mark my words, you will spend the rest of your  
career trying to recreate this.” Michael, consider your words marked.  
I also want to thank the teams I’ve had over the years. I was for-
