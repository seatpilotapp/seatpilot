This book is structured to develop your foundational skills,  
and then to build upon these with each chapter. As you learn  
more design concepts and skills, your overall ability to judge  
and create aesthetically effective designs will continue to  
grow and improve.  
The first chapters focus on the basics of color, typography,  
and layout, which are the building blocks of later chapters  
on components and user interfaces.  
The later chapters will combine everything, covering visual  
hierarchy, wireframing, and designing a website or  
application. We will bring it together to showcase how the  
combination of subtle design aspects can result in a  
well-balanced and nicely crafted website or application. WEBsite DESIGN

# Blue Yellow  
# PRIMARY COLORS  
Color theory starts with the primary colors, which can be  
used to mix and form all other colors.  
The primary colors are red, blue and yellow.  
They are part of a color wheel created by Isaac Newton in  
1666\. The wheel is still used today to help select color  
palettes, mix colors, and to construct color harmony.  
This color wheel helps pick harmonious colors better than  
what is generally selected using RGB for HEX. YOU CAN’t USE UP

THE MORE YOU HAVE Purple Orange  
# RED  
# Blue Yellow  
GREEN  
# SECONDARY COLORS  
Primary colors can be mixed to obtain secondary colors\:  
orange, purple, and green.  
Using 2 colors in close proximity on the color wheel helps  
generate a visual balance known as color harmony. Using  
colors further away on the wheel will fracture that harmony.  
Mixing colors will also help you build a color wheel to assist  
you with selecting complementary and analogous colors. — Joel Spolsky

# Tertiary COLORS  
Tertiary colors exist between our primary and secondary  
ones. They include\: vermillion, amber, chartreuse, teal,  
violet and magenta.  
These colors form the basis of our color wheel that will be  
used to define color temperature and hue in the next  
section. — Steve Jobs  
# DESIGN is not just what it  
# LOOKS LIKE  
DESIGN is how it works HUE / COLOR WHEEL  
Hue is the specific color that we are targeting. When we  
change our hue, we are essentially rotating our color wheel.  
The color wheel is the expanded version of our primary,  
secondary and tertiary colors.  
Adobe provides a great color wheel where you can select  
your colors\:  
https\://color.adobe.com/ Color  
# Does not add a pleasant quality to  
DESIGN.it reinfoces it  
— Wassily Kandinsky, Painter and Art Critic COLOR temperature  
Color temperature  
refers to the warmth or  
coolness of a color.  
Following nature, color  
temperature is easy to  
identify, with reds,  
oranges and yellows  
being warm, and blues,  
greens and purple  
being cool. Adding blue  
or yellow to a color will  
adjust its temperature.  
Used side by side, we  
can help the user better  
identify what to focus  
on. Warmer colors will  
always demand more  
attention than cooler  
colors.  
# WARM  
Warm colors tend to  
stand out and are often  
used also to show  
warnings or essential  
interactions.  
Cool colors are more  
general, and blend into  
the background. They  
can make up the  
framework of a layout,  
its passive options or  
general interactivity.  
COOL WE LIVE IN A— Paul CézanneRAINBOW  
OF CHAOS SATURATION  
The saturation of a color is determined by how pure it is.  
Adding white, black or grey will reduce its saturation.  
A pure blue color may be too intense, which is why we often  
add tone, tint and shade to balance the colors out.  
As a rule, when selecting a  
color, pick from inside the  
dashed square.  
These colors are safe and  
comfortable for most eyes,  
as more saturated colors  
can come across as harsh. — Lilly PulitzerI am a Believer THAT  
# Color Affects  
People’s Moods TINT  
Adding or removing white from color changes its tint. As a  
result, it also lightens its saturation.  
The tint will lighten colors, allowing subtext or descriptions  
to carry less priority.  
# do  
Do use tints on text or components to arrange or reflect  
their order.  
Do apply tint to the descriptive text under titles.  
Do apply tint to buttons or other components so they  
blend further into the background. Color

— Pablo Picasso TONE  
Adding or removing grey from color changes its tone, and as  
a result, it also dilutes its saturation.  
Colors with more tone and less saturation can feel calmer  
and relaxing on the eyes.  
# do  
Do add a slight tone to colors as good practice.  
Do use tone to blend items into the background.  
Do apply tone to reduce the priority of  
components such as buttons. Colors  
# speak all  
# languages  
— Joseph Addison SHADE  
Adding or removing black from color changes its shade. As  
a result, it also removes its saturation.  
The shade will darken colors, allowing for stronger contrast  
and increased priority.  
# do  
Do add shade to header/title text that requires priority.  
Do apply shade to the background when using hover  
effects for components or buttons.  
Do use ensure colors have a bit of shade added, so they  
do not come across oversaturated. Color

# SOMETHING  
— Robert Henri Selecting Colors  
Picking well-balanced colors is essential when building any  
website or application. There are a few tricks to successfully  
selecting harmonious colors.  
By using the color wheel, we can identify complementary  
primary and secondary colors that will work well together  
using the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
Monochromic colors  
Analogous colors  
Triadic colors  
•  
Tetradic colors \(Double complementary\)  
•  
Analogous complementary colors I Found I could Say Things WITH  
# Color & SHAPES  
# that I couldn’t say any other way  
# Things I had no Words For.  
— Georgia O’Keeffe Monochrome  
# Color  
By using a single color and a mix of tint, tone, and shade,  
you will be able to create several color variations.  
These options will have different levels of saturation. The  
darker shades can be used for titles and buttons, while the  
lighter tints for backgrounds and borders.

# Colors  
Picking multiple colors that look good together is done by  
selecting the colors next to the primary color. For example,  
green has neighboring colors of blue and chartreuse.  
We can select 3 analogous colors to use, mix, and match  
using this method.

Alternatively, we can pick 2 colors that work together by  
selecting their counterparts. These complementary colors  
are located on the opposite side of the color wheel.  
Blue works with orange, red with green. We can then adjust  
the tint, tone and shade to complete our color selection.

— Georgia O’Keeffe Triadic Colors  
To select 3 colors with strong contrast, you can use the tri-  
adic combination by selecting them on a triangular  
arrangement based on the color wheel.  
These triadic colors have two primary options, and a  
secondary color that is often used for backgrounds.

# COLOR Psychology?  
Colors convey different meanings depending on their use  
and juxtaposition. This is why alerts are usually displayed in  
red and confirmation buttons in green.  
Clear

Understanding the meaning of each color can allow you to  
create better websites and applications by selecting the  
color that best reflects the message you want to convey .  
Using different background colors can also play a vital part  
in how people visualize a website’s authority.  
Bright colors like greens, yellows and pinks can bring a  
more vibrant youthful vibe to a website, while dark blues  
and blacks can come across as business or corporate. Creativity

Education HOW TO USE  
# COLOR WEIGHTS  
Like fonts, colors can have weights ideally ranging from  
options like 100,200... to 700,800.  
The lower values indicate lighter tints, while the higher  
values add more shade, bringing it closer to black.  
When picking website colors, it is essential to define the  
weights that will later be used for the style guide.  
Color weights can then be used as a reference for  
headers, backgrounds, buttons and hover effects.  
Swapping to dark mode means inverting the order of  
weights, for example 100 becomes 800. 300

Do use standard weights of 300-600 for text, high-  
lights, labels and headers.  
Do use darker weights between 500-800 for headers,  
backgrounds and button hovers. USING  
# Contrast  
Using the right amount of contrast between different  
components ensures they will be easily visible.  
Contrast can be applied by adjusting the opacity and  
weight of a single color and its alternative element. Avoid  
closing matching amounts.  
Contrast can also occur between 2 different colors and how  
they are juxtapositioned. Blend colors that can be  
easily distinguished when used together.  
A tip to see if you are using enough contrast for your website  
is to view the website in greyscale. ACCESSIBILITY &  
# Contrast on the web  
WCAG \(Web Content Accessibility Guide\) 2.0 provides  
best practice guidelines to ensure that the color contrast  
between foreground \(text\) and background is appropriate  
by using a ratio. This ratio depends on the size and weight of  
the text being used.  
This difference in the brightness between two colors is  
indicated with a ratio between 1\:1 \(lowest possible contrast;  
white text on white background\) and 21\:1 \(highest possible  
contrast; black text on white background or vice versa\).  
As a rule of thumb WCAG establishes a minimum ratio of  
4.5\:1.  
# FAIL  
# PASS

Ratio 4.03\:1

Correct contrast  
Insufficient ratio for  
ratio. This allows for the  
text to be read on the  
screen easily.  
readability Creating your own  
# Color Schema  
The color schema is the first part of building a style guide.  
These colors will then be a reference when creating the  
visuals for buttons, headers, links and content.  
The elements of an effective color schema include\:  
•  
Picking primary, secondary, etc colors  
•  
Having a base color for general text \(white, black\)  
•  
Defining color weights for each color  
•  
Providing information on using each color  
We will also add a usage guide for applying these colors  
with text, buttons, and components in later chapters. Colors  
Using triadic color options, the selection  
of purple, green and orange work well  
as primary, secondary and tertiary  
colors. Select base color as white or  
black for text.  
# Weights  
Defining colors with their weights and HEX values will help  
you select and use them correctly in the future.

# typography  
is Art.— Paul Rand TYPEFACE  
A typeface is a group or  
collection of related fonts.  
When creating a website or  
application, we often pick  
one or two typefaces, one  
for our headers and one for  
paragraphs. In CSS, we refer  
to this as a font-family.  
# FONT  
A font is a specific type of  
style based on its typeface.  
Styles can include weights,  
italics, weights, etc.  
Today there are dozens of  
font variations for every  
typeface. For example,  
weights can have thin, light,  
regular to bold and black.  
# typeface  
# Roboto  
A popular typeface is  
Roboto which is commonly  
used on many websites.  
Due to its overuse, it is  
recommended to use a  
another typeface for a more  
unique feel, like Open Sans.

— Hermann Zapf Serif  
Typography has 2 types of  
serifs\: serif and sans serif.  
Serif fonts have more dec-  
orative strokes \(referred  
to as “tails” or “feet”\) at  
the ends of letters, while  
sans serif fonts do not.  
# SANs SERIF  
On the web and in  
applications, we use sans  
serif font families as they  
are easier to read.  
The exception is when  
we have large headers or  
decorative text for hero  
banners.  
Always opt for using sans  
serif when possible.

SANs SERIF BOLD  
For websites and applications, we recommend only bolding  
the essential text in your paragraph. This can be for a link,  
or to emphasize an important message, or a warning.  
Overuse of bold text can make sentences and websites  
overwhelming for users.  
Bold text is useful when using smaller font sizes, or on  
buttons or backgrounds with strong contrast.  
Do use a maximum of  
# do Don’t  
one or two bold items  
A common place we might  
use bold is to identify when  
certain text is a link or not.  
On a login screen, we could  
bold the word ‘Login’ but not  
the ‘forgot password’ link.  
Don’t use bold too  
often in texts  
Too many bolded links or  
bolded text on a page will  
dilute the emphasis or  
importance of the text.  
It might also overwhelm  
the user. Life  
# lies in being  
# Bold  
— Robert Frost Italics  
Italics are generally reserved for testimonials, references,  
or to emphasize a statement in a paragraph so that it stands  
out.  
Avoid using italics where possible. Use regular text where  
you have a label or button.  
Using italics for a full para-  
graph makes it very difficult  
to read and you can lose the  
message you wish to convey.  
# do Don’t  
Italics can be used to  
emphasize a statement,  
feeling or expression, or to  
add character to your text.

In the early days of the internet, underlined text was pre-  
dominantly used to representat hyperlinks. .  
Today, the design preference is to underline text to add em-

When styling for a blog or information rich page, you can  
capitalize titles or header text, but not paragraphs or body  
text where it might be overwhelming.  
Capitalization is safe to use for components like buttons,  
labels, and toasts when alerting for important messages.  
# don’t  
A FULL SENTENCE WRITTEN  
IN CAPS WILL APPEAR UNPRO-  
FESSIONAL.  
Don’t use all caps for a  
full sentence.  
# do  
Having an alert or warning  
needs attention for the user,  
WARNING them of a delete.  
Do use it on one item to  
make it stand out. TITLES CAN OFTEN BE SAFE  
TO USE ALL CAPS  
# do  
Do consider capitalizing some headers and  
titles to make them stand out.  
Do occasionally capitalize buttons or labels to em-  
phasize or draw attention to them.

# Letter Spacing  
Letter spacing is the space between each letter. It often  
does not need to be changed for regular font sizes.  
Consider changing the letter spacing when you increase the  
font size. As a general rule, use less spacing between letters  
in larger font sizes.  
Places to consider adjusting letter spacing include\:

Banners  
Large titles  
Headings  
Large font families  
This enables text to be read more easily and allows more  
room for other components like banners or headers. L a r g e Header  
# DOn’t  
Don’t have letters for headers spaced too far apart.  
Don’t reduce letter spacing to the point where there is  
no gap between the letters.  
# Large Title Text  
# do  
Do reduce letter spacing for text above +64px by a  
small amount such as -0.025em or -1px.  
Do use consistent letter spacing throughout the de-  
sign. A

# Line Height  
Leading is the technical term for the line height of text.  
Good line height gives more space for paragraphs and less  
for headers, making them visually easier to read.  
Poor leading can give the appearance that the content is  
disjointed, which may make the content more difficult to  
follow and users to quickly lose interest.  
As line height increases by default relative to size, it is  
recommended to reduce the line height with increasing text  
size. Consider the –  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Size of the font. Larger fonts require less leading  
Length of the lines. Longer lines need more leading  
Amount of text. More text needs less leading  
Purpose of the text. Most headlines require less  
leading than paragraphs or body text “Too much line height will

Regular paragraphs should  
have just enough line height to

# Font Size  
Font size for a website must be readable no matter the  
device or viewport.  
There is no “ideal” or “perfect” font size, but a good starting  
point is 16px. From there, you can adjust as needed based  
on the specific font you are using and the overall design of  
your website. For example on larger screens you can even  
increase this to 18 or 24px.  
Remember that not all fonts are created equal. Some fonts  
are easier to read at smaller sizes, while others are more  
difficult. Consider –  
•  
The amount of text on the page\: If there is a lot  
of text on the page, it may be necessary to increase  
the font size to make text more readable.  
•  
•  
The target audience\: If the website is aimed at  
older users, it may be necessary to use a larger font  
size.  
The website’s overall design\: Increase the font  
size if the website has a lot of other visual elements. FONT SIZE  
# FONT SCALING  
When creating sizes for H1, H2, etc, use the Modular Scale  
system to calculate font sizes for your text.  
It is based on the harmonious relationship of sizes, making  
it easy to find the right px amounts quickly.  
# Header 1  
# Header 2  
# Header 3  
# Header 4  
Header 5  
Regular paragraph, avoid using  
lorem ipsum as filler text.  
Small labels, placeholder text above inputs, or other  
small alerts.  
Use 3.125em / 50px for H1  
Use 2.618em / 42px for H2  
Use 1.931em / 30px for H3  
Use 1.618em / 25px for H4  
Use 1.194em / 19px for H5  
Use 1.0em / 16px for body P  
Use 0.667em / 11px for small

# Paragraphs  
Start with using a larger paragraph font size for desktop  
devices and then reduce the size only slightly for  
tablets and mobile devices.  
# Desktop Tablet  
Desktop screens are larger,  
wider and closer to people’s  
faces, so ensure you use larger  
fonts. It will make text easier for  
people to read and absorb the  
content that is provided to them.  
18-24 px with 0% reduction Tablets offer an  
option between  
desktop and

# Headers  
The header font size looks best when it does not break a  
line. It undergoes a large reduction of size, up to 50%, for  
smaller device viewports, compared to paragraphs \(which  
reduce by only about 25%\).

Do significantly  
reduce header sizes  
for smaller devices. aaa  
# Font Weight  
Font weight is more than just bolding text. Fonts like  
Roboto provide a variation of weights, including light,  
regular, medium, and black. You can utilize font weight in  
headers for different effects or to make specific text stand  
out.  
# do  
Do increase font weight on  
small text.  
Do reduce font weight as  
text size increases.  
Do combine font weights in  
large text to make  
certain words stand out  
Small text like labels, toasts or on buttons, benefit  
from being in bold so that they are easier to read.  
The larger the font  
The less weight needed  
to look good.  
Use combinations to  
your advantage!  
# don’t  
# Overwhelm  
# large & loud  
When the size of font gets smaller, it can become more  
difficult to read.  
Don’t overuse bold on  
large text.  
Don’t use very light  
weights on small text. Thin

Black Legibility  
Legibility is ensuring text is as easy to read as possible.  
Good legibility is essential in web design and user  
interfaces because it helps users locate the information  
they need and navigate the website or app more easily. It  
can also reduce frustration and increase user satisfaction  
with the overall experience.  
A number of factors affect legibility. These include\: the type  
of device being used, the user’s age, and any vision  
impairments they may have. For example, using a larger font  
size may be necessary for older users, or avoid clashing font  
and background colors for those with color-blindness. In the previous sections we covered the use of types of font,  
font size, spacing, weight and color. Together, these aspects  
combine to create legible aesthetics.  
Good legibility therefore involves\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Using easy to read fonts for the user.  
Consideration of the user’s age and any vision  
impairments.  
Using capital letters to emphasise important text.  
Using dark text colors for light backgrounds, and vice  
versa.  
Avoid using busy patterns of text behind busy  
images. Poor legibility Using incorrect font families, weights, siz-  
ing, contrast and spacing.  
# don’t  
Don’t use the same sans-serif font for your  
headings and paragraphs.  
Don’t overdo contrast or spacing to try and fit all the  
text into a small area.  
Don’t set the color or contast too low for text.  
# Great legibility  
A good sentence needs to be large enough,  
with good contrast and line height.  
# do  
Do use sans-serif font that is smaller with only subtle  
contrast or opacity to the header.  
Do use serif for titles so that it stands out from the de-  
scriptive text under the title. Typography  
# is two-dimensional  
# architecture,  
# based on experience  
# and imagination,  
# and guided by rules  
# and readability.  
— Hermann Zapf TEXT hierarchy  
Taking hierarchy into consideration involves thinking about  
how each piece of the text relates to the others around it.  
This is important for legibility and findability, which in turn  
support usability and learnability for user experience.  
The goal is to make it easy for users to find the information  
they need, when they need it.  
For a login form, this would mean that the form fields and  
the submit button are at the top of the hierarchy, and the  
less important details \(like the forgot password link\) are at  
the bottom. User Login

# Tips  
Size communicates hierarchy. The most important  
pieces of information are usually larger, while the  
least important are smaller.  
Position the most important pieces of text are usual-  
ly at the top of the page, while the least important are  
at the bottom.  
Colorful text stands out from the others is seen first,  
while the least important are in a color that blends in.  
Bold or underlined text is also seen first.  
Indentation of text is also seen first. tT  
# Creating your own  
# Typography Schema  
To create a typographic schema, first choose a typeface or  
set of typefaces to use for the foundation of your schema.  
Next select a few key text elements \(such as headings, body  
text, and captions\) and define how those elements should  
look.  
Decide on a few additional rules, such as line height and  
spacing, that will give your schema a consistent, profession-  
al look. Consider the –  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Typeface\: pick a font for headers and paragraphs.  
Sizing\: decide on your H1-H6 and body text sizes.  
Spacing\: define your line height and letter spacing.  
Examples\: provide styled examples for typography and  
its use \(see next page\). Example Style Guide

The building blocks of any website are components. These  
can be small and simple \(like a button\), or large and  
complex \(like a carousel\).  
No matter their size or complexity, all components should  
be designed with the same care and attention. They include\:  
•  
•

components –  
•

Usability\: How easy it is to use the component..  
Aesthetics\: The visual appearance of the component.  
Functionality\: The way the component works.  
Accessibility\: The ability for everyone to use it.

# but  
significant— Don Draper Spacing  
Spacing, or a spatial system, is the amount of room or  
pixels inside, outside, and around elements.  
Although spacing is technically not a component, it is critical  
to ensure that all components are consistently designed.  
Spacing applies to margins, padding and distance from el-  
ements and sections. To make a design look good, having  
predictable spacing is necessary.  
•  
Consistency\: Having all elements adhere to the same  
spacing rules creates a cohesive design.  
•  
Margins and padding\: These define the amount of  
space around elements.  
•  
Distance\: used in visual hierarchy and to draw atten-  
tion to certain elements.  
•  
Accessibility\: The ability for everyone to use it.  
•  
Gutters\: These are the spaces between columns in a  
grid system. Tips  
If you are unsure how much white space to use,  
start your design with generous amounts of white  
space, and slowly reduce this amount until you  
reach a point you feel comfortable with.  
It is easier to remove white space when it is abun-  
dant than to add white space when there is too lit-  
tle.  
Define spacing early on in  
your project, and use the stan-  
dards set for negative spacing,  
components, typography and  
icons.  
Set and use the space sytem you create. Be consistent with how you  
apply spacing throughout your  
project. If one button has 30px  
padding, they all should.  
Set space the same for all comopnents. SPACing  
# BaseLINE Units  
We can set a baseline unit to be applied to elements like  
grids, keylines, padding and more.  
We use increments of this baseline unit to ensure consistent  
spacing throughout the design.  
Common spacing options include 4 point and 5 point  
systems, where a component has increments of 4, 8, 12, or  
5, 10, 15 set for spacing.  
# don’t

8 px  
Inconsistent spacing can look  
unprofessional.  
Don’t use variable spacing \(eg. 1,3,11,9\)  
for each side element  
Using 4 point system, spacing  
can be consistent.  
Do use increments of \(4, 12, 24\) for equal  
spacing on top, bottom, left, right. 5 point spacing  
Five unit increment variations are used for all spacing options.

The baseline unit can also be used to measure space between  
elements. Use 12 px of space between buttons and other elements.  
Set all margins, paddings, and space between components in increments of 4. SPACing  
# GRids & Columns  
Grids and columns should have consistent spacing based  
on the baseline units. These keep things aligned correctly  
and positioned asthetically.  
Twelve column design is often used for websites and a  
repeating grid structure is used for applications.  
When placing elements on the page, place them within the  
grid or columns. Use baseline units to set gutters as well.

Logo Buttons  
Buttons are elements that when pressed, allows the user to  
perform an action. The design of a button depends on the  
priority of the resulting action and will determine how visible  
it should be on a website or application.  
The 3 main types of buttons are\:  
•  
Primary button  
This button is the main action you want a user to take.  
•  
Secondary buttons  
Alternative actions a user can select.  
•  
Tertiary buttons  
Passive actions which are rarely used.  
Design considerations for buttons should include ample  
space for users see and select them. This means having  
more padding around text, along with clear colors that  
contrast against the background of a website or application  
to make the button stand out. B

Do resize font size together with  
button padding to retain legibility  
on different viewports .  
Small buttons can be  
difficult to click for desk-  
top and mobile users.  
Don’t use less than 14px for the  
font sizes on button text.  
# Primary  
Secondary  
Tertiary  
Primary buttons use vibrant colors and are larger  
to signify the main action you want a user to take.  
Avoid having multiple primary buttons on a page.  
Secondary buttons use more subtle colors and  
often have smaller and lighter backgrounds to  
reflect they are alternative actions users can take.  
Tertiary buttons use simple outlines or no  
background because they are the least important  
actions users take. BORDERS  
Use borders to help separate information or content.  
You can apply borders to buttons, sections, containers,  
menus and other elements. However, too many borders can  
cause the user interface to feel overwhelming.  
# don’t  
# do  
Too much color or  
focus takes attention  
away from content.  
A subtle border color  
allows attention to  
remain on content.  
Don’t make borders too light or dark in  
contrast to their background  
Do reduce the opacity or color of a border  
to allow content to be more in focus.  
# Tips  
The more content or sections  
you have, the more borders can  
help to separate them.  
Keep borders light and simple to  
ensure they help separate  
information sparingly.  
Set only minimum use of borders when possible. One line can do better than a whole border box. Navigation  
Apply a border to specific text \(border bottom\) to show an active item  
on a header menu.

First Name... First Name... SHADOWS  
Shadow is an effect we can apply to components to draw  
attention to them. Adding shadow to an element also adds  
depth to allow it to stand out.  
Often, the darker and larger the shadow, the more depth.  
Shadows should be applied gradually in minimal amounts.  
You can also consider removing any component borders as  
the shadow will work to outline the element.  
Shadow can be applied to\:  
•  
Hover effects over a button to indicate it is an action  
•  
Show a form is active and ready for input when clicked  
•  
Cascade or overlap elements, with important elements at the top  
•  
Separate different sections of the user interface.  
Use online resources to improve your shadows. The follow-  
ing site by Brumm is an excellent resources to create shad-  
ows\: https\://brumm.af/shadows Depth with Shadows  
Add shade or tone to the box backgrounds to emphasize  
components. Creating darker and heavier shadows with an  
offset on the Y axis will create additional depth on a page.

Don’t set opacity of shadows to full and  
use them with borders.  
Do use light shadow without a border. A  
box shadow opacity of about 0.15 is great. ICONS  
Add icons to elements like action buttons or labels \(see next  
section\) to provide your user visual information on what the  
button does or what the label means.  
Only add icons to aspects of the interface that you want your  
user to notice. Avoid overusing icons, as too many can cause  
the interface to become overwhelming.  
In some instances, you can remove text entirely & use icons.

# Tips Tips  
Icon is used to signal data is  
missing and that the user’  
attention is required.  
Set appropriate icons for labels to give  
user visual information on action required.  
No icon was added to the  
submit button as too many  
icons can be overwhelming.  
Set icons only when required. Too many  
can make a page feel clustered. Labels  
Labels provide feedback to your user on what is happening  
on the interface.  
Labels remain hidden until they are needed to alert the user  
that their attention is required, or if the user has to complete  
specific tasks.  
Keep labels placed next to the item they are related to and  
ensure the right color provides meaning.  
Error something has happened that the user needs to know  
Success action has been competed successfully.  
Information that the user should be aware of.  
The 3 common types of labels are – error, success and infor-  
mation. Pick the correct label for the the message you wish  
to display. do  
Info Label\: Make sure you read this label before the comments below.  
Ensure that information based labels are read first by placing them  
before content. Messages such as a successful change, or  
requirements for a form should be placed at the top of the page.  
Do place information based labels above content that it refers to.  
# don’t  
When an error occurs, add warning labels below the item with the  
error. This allows the the element in focus to stay in position, while other  
content is pushed down by the warning label.  
Warning\: Read this after an error to keep attention on element.  
Don’t add warnings at the top or bottom of a page, but next to the element they are related to.  
# Tips  
When in doubt always provide more information to a user. Labels can  
be used for almost all situations user interaction. Pick the right color,  
write a useful message, and display it in the correct spot.  
Info\: Notify the user with additional methods or context for their interactions.  
Set the right color for messages, with useful information that helps the user. Dividers  
A divider can be used to separate content, including the  
content in the same section.  
Dividers can take numerous forms, including\:  
•  
A single line  
•  
Negative space  
•  
Color  
•  
Shadows  
Examples of where dividers are used include separating the  
login from the register button, or group inputs in forms.

grouped elements.  
Do add extra spacing between the divider  
and the elements. Single Line  
A single line is the perfect divider to separate content. Reducing the line’s  
opacity ensures it does not stand out too much as a diver to ensure focus re-  
mains on the content.  
# Color  
Use color to divide sections apart, especially in forms. This can allow you to  
group certain inputs together.

# Negative Space Shadows  
Simply add space between content  
to divide them. If 15px is the  
standard gap, using 30 or 45px can  
be used to divide the sections.  
Adding box shadows as a divider  
between content is a subtle  
approach with similar results to  
using color or negative space.

City FORMS  
A form has several components that often lack style when  
using on a browser.  
The components of a form should have similar style to each  
other and the layout of the site itself. Form components can  
include\:  
•  
Input  
•  
Radio  
•  
Checkbox  
•  
Textarea  
•  
Button Groups  
•  
Submit  
When forming the user interface, consider how to allow in-  
formation to be easily read.  
Labeling inputs and grouping sections can have a greater  
impact on the form itself than style or colors applied. the function of design  
# is letting design function  
— Micha Commeren FORM  
# INPUTS  
The text input components are form fields that are provid-  
ed for user input of text information.  
They are made up of three main UI elements\:  
•  
Label that titles the input item  
•  
Input itself for entering the information  
•  
Helper text to provide context or assistance for info  
The design for a input form is best presented when you  
combine all three elements together. Label

Input states  
# default  
The default or active state  
is when you haven’t clicked  
an input field and it is ready  
and waiting for action.  
Email  
name@mail.com  
# focus  
The focus state indicates  
the user that the input is  
selected and that they can  
start typing.  
Email  
# disabled  
The disabled state is when  
the user should know that  
it is there, but can’t interact  
with it.  
# valid  
The valid state is used to  
indicate the users that they  
have provided valid informa-  
tion.  
Email  
janedoe@mail.com  
# invalid  
The invalid state is used to

You can enhance their design by removing the border in place  
for a background color. This should be shaded darker than it’s  
respective background. This allows you to futher shade the  
background on hover, and focus states.  
# don’t  
Enter username...  
Enter email...  
Strong colors on inputs can cause them to look like buttons.  
Don’t use overwhelming borders or colors for inputs.  
Don’t set the placeholder color to the same color as input text  
Don’t use icons or labels inconsistently.  
# do  
Enter username... Enter email...  
A subtle background shade makes inputs stand out better.  
Do use shade or tint for inputs that can increase on hover and focus state.  
Do use opacity of at least 50% for placeholder text to make it passive.  
Do add icons to all inputs, or remove from all inputs to keep consistency.  
# Tips  
Confirmed\: username available  
Adrian Adrian  
Error\: username already taken Outlines and labels with color can provide additional details about the  
users information visually.  
Set colors in the border or background to indicate if a user input is correct or not.  
Set corresponding label with the style change to acknowledge what happened. Input Hover & Focus  
Apply a different shade or outline to an input on hover or fo-  
cus allows the user to know it was selected.  
# don’t  
# do  
White hover input...  
Enter username...  
Black focus input...  
Enter email...  
Don’t dramatically change the style on  
hover, like having inputs go from white to  
black.  
Don’t add extra styling elements like a bor-  
der of 2px that changes the height or layout  
of an input  
Do add changes of only 5% - 15% for tint or  
shade added to the background of an input

Do take away styling that doesn’t change  
height or width, such as having the border  
color the same as background color.

erly designed. Ensure there is specific differences between a  
button and input.

Don’t size text inputs  
larger than the expected  
content, in this example  
it’s too large for a Zip  
Code, also the user loses  
track of the field because  
placeholder disappears  
after input is focused or  
has value.  
Do size the container  
proportional to the  
expected user input,  
also the placeholder  
is not replacing the

Instead of using the outline property to indicate the fo-  
cus state, you can use the box-shadow property which is  
more flexible and lets you achieve a better look. sizing  
Most use cases don’t require more than 3 input sizes\: small,  
default and large. As a good rule of thumb you can use the  
following defaults\:

The checkbox component is used to let the user select one  
or more items from a list.  
It consists of three main elements\:  
•  
Primary Label that titles the group of checkboxes

Checkbox itself for that can be have three states  
\(checked, unchecked, or indeterminate\),  
•  
Checkbox label which should wrap the item and ex-

When designing for mobile devices, it is important to ensure  
that checkboxes are large enough to be easily tapped with a  
finger.  
Both the checkbox and its accompanying label should be  
larger than they would be on a desktop device. This will  
make it easier for users to select the checkbox and com-

# RADIO  
Radio buttons are a user interface element used to let the  
user choose one and only one option from a predefined set  
of mutually exclusive options.  
They are made up of three main components\:  
•  
Group label to describe the group of options or  
provide guidance for making a selection  
•  
Input to indicate the appropriate state \(by default,  
an option is selected\)  
•  
Label to describe the information you want to se-  
lect or unselect.  
The main difference between radio buttons and checkboxes  
is that radio inputs allow the user to select only one item,  
while checkboxes allow the user to select any number of  
items. Radio button group label

sure that it is proportional to the expected answer. This  
helps guide the user to provide the correct response. If the

When designing a submit button, it is important to make  
sure that the label is clear and concise, so that users under-  
stand what will happen when they click the button.  
Additionally, the button should be designed in a way that is

Badges are a useful UI element used to inform the user of  
the status of an object or action that has been taken.  
They are composed of three main components  
•  
Label that conveys the status of the object or action  
•  
Background or container, to hold all the elements  
•  
Icon \(optional\) for visual identification  
Badges can be used to indicate completion of a task, prog-  
ress towards a goal, or the current status of an item. They  
are a great way to provide users with quick and easily un-  
derstandable feedback. Background  
# Licensed  
Icon \(optional\) Label types of badges  
# positive  
When designing positive badges, use a green background  
color to signify success.  
Labels should be clear and positive, such as\: approved,  
complete, success, new, purchased, or licensed. This will  
help to reinforce the positive feedback and create a more  
enjoyable user experience.

When creating negative badges, it is important to use a red  
background color to clearly differentiate them from posi-  
tive badges.  
The labels jected,” “Alert,” or “Failed.” This will ensure that users un-  
derstand the message being conveyed and take the appro-  
priate action.  
should be clear and direct, such as “Error,” “Re-  
Rejected informative  
Incorporating informative badges into your web design can  
be a great way to provide visual cues to users.  
When using badges, make sure to use a blue background  
color to help them stand out. The labels for the badges  
should be clear and concise, such as “active”, “in use”,  
“live”, or “published”.  
This will help users quickly understand the status of the  
page or feature they are viewing.

# -alerts-  
Toasts \(or alerts\) are notifications that provide feedback in-  
formation to the user about a recent operation.  
They should be used to inform users of updates or changes  
to system status, and provide immediate feedback of an ac-  
tion. This helps to build trust between the user and the sys-  
tem, and can be used to communicate success or failure of  
an action. They are made up of the following UI components\:  
•  
Icon to inform the user of the kind of notification at a  
glance  
•  
Title to give users a quick overview of the notification  
•  
Inline notification action \(optional\) is a ghost button  
or link that address users to to a page with further de-  
tails

# few thing are  
designed well— Brian Reed breadcrumbs  
Breadcrumbs inform users of their current location, and  
enable them to quickly move up to a parent level or previous  
step.  
Use this pattern when you have nested content organized in  
a hierarchy of two or more levels. Don’t use it if your prod-  
uct has a single level navigation because it adds unneces-  
sary clutter.  
They are made up of two UI components\:  
•  
Page link to direct users to the parent-level page  
•  
Separator to distinguish between each page 1  
# Categories Women  
# / / Shoes  
2 don’t  
Home | Contact us  
Don’t replace the global navigation bar or the local nav-  
igation within a section with breadcrumbs, they should  
always act as secondary navigation pattern.  
Don’t make the breadcrumb corresponding to the cur-  
rent page a link.  
Don’t use breadcrumbs for sites with flat hierarchies  
that are only one or two levels deep.  
Don’t use a separator other than “\>” or “/”.  
# do  
Home Women  
/ / Apparel  
Do use a short and concise text, ideally no more than  
one word. Users should be able to anticipate where  
they’ll get redirected to after clicking on the link.  
Do make it clear that is a link that will redirect them out  
of the current page.  
Do include the current page as the last item in the  
breadcrumb trail.  
Do use industry standards to separate links, “\>” or “/”  
are both valid. tips  
•  
When working on mobile where there is less room, don’t  
clutter the UI with nested breadcrumbs. Including the  
last level will suffice.

— Bruno Munari tables  
Tables are used to display groups of information across rows  
and columns.  
Use it when you need to display a collection of structured  
data, and you want to provide sorting, searching, pagination  
and filtering on this data.  
They are made up of the following UI components\:  
•  
Search to find information faster  
•  
Header row describes which type of element is dis-  
played on every column  
•  
Sorting to sort information  
•  
Row checkbox to select different rows  
•  
Columns that group content by its type  
•  
Rows that contain data related to a single element  
•  
Pagination to control how table data is displayed Header row

Don’t use unnecessary borders as they clutter the UI.

decreases usability. Use pagination instead.  
Don’t put similar data types in two different columns.  
If you have a dish with a garnish you can group those in

Do adjust the layout of a card on different screen  
sizes.  
Move the image/media to the left and make sure  
to only crop the non-essential parts of it on larger  
screens.  
On mobile, header and body text should be be-  
tween 24px-28px and 16px -18px respectively.  
On desktop, the header and body text should be  
between 34px-38px and 20px-21px respectively.  
Header, body text and main call to action \(button\)  
should be displayed in a single column. don’t  
Don’t use large amounts of information in cards.  
Don’t use the same border radius from inner elements  
and the container.  
Don’t center align text, it’s more difficult to read.  
Don’t use too dark shadows.  
Don’t visually clutter the card, use appropriate white  
space between elements. do  
Do use subtle shadows to indicate elevation on a card.  
Do use dividers to separate regions in cards or to indi-  
cate areas of a card that can be expanded.  
Do use the appropriate heading level for your page. Up-  
date heading level based on the content of your page to  
make sure card headings are in the correct logical out-  
line order.  
Do make the whole card the primary action if no primary  
CTA is available on the card.  
Do maintain an appropriate hierarchy between media,  
primary text, supporting text and actions. Keep primary  
text larger and supporting text smaller. accordions

# response  
to a strategic question— Mariona López iconography  
Icons are visual symbols used to represent features, func-  
tionality or content.  
Icons are meant to be read at a glance and are typically cre-  
ated on a square \(1\:1\). considerations when choosing  
# icons  
# 1\. size  
A good rule of thumb is to start with a 24 x 24px grid and  
scale the icons from there.  
Most use cases should be covered with three icon sizes, if  
you need more you can use a number multiple of eight to  
determine the size you want.  
20px 24px 32px 40px  
Note\: When using large icons for representing features in a  
website you can use 80 x 80px grid and you can consider  
adding more detail as the grid is larger. 2\. styles  
Icons can have multiple styles\: outline, solid, two tone, etc.  
No matter what style you use, it’s important to keep consis-  
tency across a set of icons.

Buttons  
Outline icons should be used for primary navigation  
allowing you to have the filled icon when it’s selected,  
designed to be rendered at 24 x 24.  
Solid icons should be used for buttons, form elements,  
and support text, designed to be rendered at 20 x 20. 3\. icon & text alignment/style  
When icons are used next to text, they should be center  
aligned and the same color as the text.

# do  
SVG 5\. keep it simple  
Complex icons are best suited when they are rendered at  
least on a 40 by 40px. Here is an example of how you can  
go from a large, complex icon to a smaller simple one\:  
# 6\. touch/click target  
For smaller screens icons of 24px can use a touch target of  
48px \(about twice the size of the icon\).  
48px / 3rem 24px / 1.5rem

Do remember your icon’s context and purpose. Your  
context can significantly alter how you approach  
designing icons. Where will your icons be used?  
Will they be implemented in an app’s interface, on a  
marketing website?  
Do consider adding a label to the icon when possi-  
ble, this makes the icon more accessible.  
Do consider adding a tooltip to icons that are not  
next to text, this will help clear any confusion the  
user might have. sizing  
If you set an icon to have a width and height of 1.5em then  
you can change the size of it with the font-size property of  
the parent container.  
This helps by creating an inherent relationship between the  
text and icon size. If you scale the text down or up, the icon  
will resize accordingly.

An avatar is a graphical representation of a person  
through a profile picture or image, an icon, or a string with  
initials.  
The most common avatar types are\:  
•  
•  
•  
Image avatar  
Initials avatar  
Icon avatar Image avatar  
Initials avatar  
Icon avatar  
JD usage  
Although avatars may appear in different places, the same  
image, initials or placeholder should appear for a given ob-  
ject instance throughout the application.  
Here are different examples where an avatar may appear\:  
# toolbar  
The avatar can represent  
the dropdown selection for  
a profile  
# contact  
# information  
The avatar helps to stand  
out unique data when there  
is lots of information, e.g.  
when viewing a large list of  
contact information.

vide an image.  
Do keep good contrast with the avatar background color,  
when using an avatar with initials or icon.  
Do add a subtle gray border around the avatar, this helps  
to determine the avatar boundaries when the avatar  
background is the same as the app background. UX TIPS

Katarina Brookes  
kbrookes@mail.com visual hierarchy  
In web design visual hierarchy is used to rank design ele-  
ments in the order you want your users to view them.  
By properly laying out elements one can influence user’s  
perceptions and guide them to desired actions.  
The purpose of visual hierarchy is that the end users find  
each design element in the order of intended importance.  
# why is visual hierarchy  
# important?  
Because a properly established visual hierarchy on a web  
page can significantly reduce the amount of effort needed  
by users to find what they are looking for. When done right it  
removes friction and enhances usability of a product. design is  
# thinking

Don’t put together multiple elements with little to none

Do keep a clear hierarchy between text and images.  
Do make the primary call to action stand out so that  
users can clearly detect the main purpose of the page.  
Do leave appropriate space between elements, this

# visual patterns  
Users typically scan a website instead of reading every  
word. To accommodate that flow, it’s important to build a  
visual hierarchy.  
The two most popular ways to create a hierarchy are the  
F Pattern and the Z Pattern.  
You can use these visual patterns to position elements  
across these lines in the relevance that we want.  
E.g. company logo on the upper left as it’s the first thing the  
users look at. the f pattern  
The F pattern works best for information-heavy websites.  
The design flows left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and is very  
conventional.

# the z pattern  
The Z pattern works best for websites that don’t have a lot of  
information. It allows users to skim from your logo at the top  
left, through your navigation, down to your first important  
piece of information, and then across the page.

# visual hierarchy  
# size & text  
Sizing is a very basic yet powerful principle that can give  
elements more importance than others and help draw the  
viewer’s attention towards a certain area or element.  
The bigger the element, the greater are the chances that a  
user will scan it first. People scan bigger things first.  
The smaller the element, the more likely the user is going to  
leave the element to scan it last. People scan smaller thing  
last.  
For text, we can significantly increase the importance of an  
element by increasing its font size.  
As a good rule of thumb, make sure the most important text  
to stand out first and foremost.  
You want the user eyes to see titles first, lead paragraphs  
second and less important sections last. people don’t use a product

There is no clear hierarchy es-  
tablished between the name, the  
occupation and years of experi-  
ence.  
2  
All seem to have almost the  
same font size resulting in all  
having the same hierarchy.

The only difference in hierarchy  
comes from the order of reading.  
From top to bottom, first John  
Doe, second Senior Developer  
and last, years of experience. do  
1  
The user sees the name of  
the person first because it  
has the largest font size.  
2  
The second element the  
users see is the occupation  
due to having the largest  
font size after the name.  
3  
Last, the users will see the  
lead paragraph which has  
the smallest font size.  
# tips  
Use sizing to override the reading patterns we saw before.  
In the above example we read the name of the person first  
although the years of experience come first in order. Following the same principles as before, in the following ex-  
ample we placed the most important title first and made it  
the largest on the screen with a font size of 40px.  
Then, we placed the lead paragraph with a smaller font size,  
followed by the sections’ titles and paragraphs with the  
smallest font size on the screen.

# buttons  
Sizing can also be applied to buttons to not only distinguish  
them from other elements on the page but also from each  
other, as multiple buttons are often grouped.  
For instance, a primary action button should be more visu-  
ally dominant than a secondary or tertiary action button. if you find an element of

Buttons or actions that you want the user to see first should  
have a clear contrast and different color than the rest of the  
page. By doing so you will create a focal point on the action  
you want the users to complete.  
You can achieve this by giving more important buttons or ac-  
tions a full background color that is the same as the primary  
color of your palette of choice.  
Give less important actions either a link style by underling  
the text and making the color be the primary color, or an al-  
ternative can be an outline or ghost button. don’t  
Request Demo Watch Video  
Don’t make secondary actions have the  
same color as a primary actions, this con-  
fuses users on which action they should  
complete first.  
# do  
Watch Video  
Request Demo  
Do make the primary action have the pri-  
mary color of your palette and the second-  
ary action have an outline or ghost style. Destructive actions should also be given a different color  
than the rest.  
You should use the red color for actions that can’t be un-  
done, for example permanently removing an account.  
# don’t  
Delete Account  
Are you sure you want to delete your account?  
If you delete your account, you will permanently  
lose your profile, messages and photos.  
Cancel Delete Account  
Don’t make the destructive action  
button have a normal color like blue. By doing so there is a clear sense that the action is import-  
ant and might not be possible to undo it.  
In the next example, the delete account button color gives a  
clear visual cue to the user that is an important action.  
# do  
Delete Account  
Are you sure you want to delete your account?  
If you delete your account, you will permanently  
lose your profile, messages and photos.  
Cancel Delete Account  
Do use a red button to warn users  
they’re about to commit a dangerous  
act. When elements have the same color and layout, there is no  
clear distinction between any of them, if you want to create a  
focal point you can use a different color to emphasize one of  
them.  
# don’t  
Don’t make all the cards look the same,  
use a different color to emphasize the  
most popular plan. A good example of this could be when we want to encour-  
age the user to pick a certain pricing plan, for that you can  
change the background color of a specific plan to make it  
more prominent and eye catching.  
# do  
Do use a different color to establish a  
clear focus point and encourage the user  
to pick the pricing plan of your choice.  
Do use color psychology to convey  
different emotions on the user’s  
perception. For example, green and  
blue can be used to suggest comfort  
while black can be used to convey that  
something is luxurious or more corporate  
suited. use case

# contrast  
In web design, contrast is the practice of making elements  
look different from each other in order to make the import-  
ant elements eye-catching while others less so.  
It can be used in color, size, space to stablish a clear visual  
hierarchy between elements. design isn’t finished until  
# somebody is using it.  
— Brenda Laurel How to use CONTRAST in COLOR?  
Contrast in color is the most common use case, you can use  
a different more contrasting color for a particular element, in  
order to make it stand out from the rest.  
In this example our eyes are drawn to the lighter circle, because  
it has a higher contrast than the rest. don’t  
Request Demo  
Don’t choose colors that don’t belong together, the  
green and red combination creates strain on the  
eyes.  
Don’t use heavy shades of color together, it makes  
it more hard to read.  
# do  
Request Demo  
Do pick a foreground and background color with a  
contrast ratio of at least 4.5\:1.  
You can use this tool to check  
the contrast ratio\:  
https\://webaim.org/resources/contrastcheckerHow to use CONTRAST in SIZE?  
Contrast also helps create relationships between elements.  
Elements that are most important or need to be looked at  
first should be given a bigger size, the contrary applies for  
less important elements.  
In this example our eyes are drawn to the bigger circle, because  
bigger elements are scanned first. don’t  
This is a title  
This is a subtitle  
This is the paragraph which usually  
contains more text than the title and  
subtitle.  
Don’t choose the same size for every text, this con-  
fuses the user on where they should start reading.  
# do  
4x  
2x  
1x  
# This is a title  
# This is a subtitle  
This is the paragraph which usually  
contains more text than the title and  
subtitle.  
Do choose different sizes for title, subtitle and  
paragraph. This creates a clear hierarchy of what to  
read first, second and last. How to use CONTRAST in space?  
Space also can play an important role in organizing design  
elements.  
By surrounding important elements with some extra blank  
space you will draw more attention to that element and  
make it stand out.  
In this example the extra white space around the bottom right  
circle makes our eyes focus on that section. don’t  
Company

Don’t make the ui look too cluttered, this will prevent users  
from finding what they are looking for faster.  
# do  
Company  
My website  
Do increase the amount of white space and remove un-  
necessary elements, this will result in a much more clear  
UI. How to use CONTRAST in shapes?  
You can use contrast in shapes by making elements stand  
out by their difference in physical form.  
When you want to make an element stand out you can  
choose a different shape from the rest of the elements on  
the page.  
In this example the eyes are drawn to the square shape because  
its the only one different among all shapes in the example. don’t  
Don’t make all the cards look the same when one is  
hover over, instead make use of a slightly different  
shape in this state to make it stand out.  
# do  
Do increase the size or apply a skew to make the  
shape stand out. tips

# proximity  
Proximity is the practice of placing related elements close  
together and separating unrelated elements.  
We can do this by using varying amounts of whitespace to  
either unite or separate elements.  
White space guides the user’s eyes in the intended direc-  
tion, creates contrast and makes a lasting impression.  
Whitespace separates the shapes into two distinct grouping  
through the principle of proximity. Even when including differing  
shapes within each group, these two groupings are still clear. don’t  
Don’t group together unrelated  
elements, this may camouflage  
them from users.

less white space between the  
navigation items to make it clear  
they all belong to the same

We use more white space around the logo and log out  
button to separate them from the navigation items group. How to use proximity in forms?  
Proximity plays an important role in how users scan form  
elements.  
By placing labels near corresponding form fields, you make  
it much easier for users to scan the form.  
# don’t  
Label

Don’t place labels far away from inputs, this

Do group related fields together, you can help  
users understand why they need to fill in this  
information.  
The fields in the above example are categorized  
into two groups \(personal information & account  
information\). How to use proximity in text?  
Proximity can be leveraged to create meaningful groups  
when presenting basic text content.  
Sentences should be grouped together in paragraphs sepa-  
rated above and below by whitespace.

# alignment  
In web design alignment refers to how we position ele-  
ments between each other.  
Alignment helps to create order, organize elements, to cre-  
ate visual relationships and improve the overall readability  
of your website.  
Proper usage of alignment can highly affect how our brains  
scans content, so we can use it to make an impact in the  
overall hierarchy of our site as well.  
In this example our eyes are drawn to the lighter circle, because  
it’s not properly align like the rest of the circles. VERTICAL ALIGNMENT  
Vertical alignment refers to how elements align on the hori-  
zontal \(x\) axis. When elements align on a horizontal line, you  
create vertical alignment.  
Invisible horizontal lines that dictate vertical alignment.  
When you have different heights you can align all the  
cards to the baseline of the heights card. Top or Bottom Vertical AlignmenT  
When the height of two or more elements are significantly  
different, it’s usually a best practice to vertically align the  
content to either the bottom or top  
# don’t  
Search  
Don’t have different starting points for the cards  
as it makes it more difficult for users to scan a  
page and find related elements. The vertical alignment of items influences the behavior of  
users causing them to miss visual cues such as in the exam-  
ple below to see the search box.  
# do  
Search  
Do align both cards to the top. This makes it clear  
that although they serve different purposes they  
are both related to each other. centered Vertical Alignment  
When the height of two or more elements are slightly differ-  
ent it might make more sense to vertically align them to the  
center instead of top or bottom.  
# don’t  
LOGO  
# do  
LOGO horizontal ALIGNMENT  
Horizontal alignment refers to how elements align on the  
vertical \(y\) axis. When elements align on a vertical line, you  
create horizontal alignment.  
Invisible vertical lines that dictate horizontal alignment. Left and Right Horizontal Alignment  
For larger layouts to keep all the content horizontally align  
it’s common to establish a max-width for the content to ex-  
pand and pushing the components to either the left or right  
side, often refer to as a container.  
# don’t  
Don’t make the container larger than the screen.  
Don’t make the container larger than the 1200px. As sections change from a website whether its navigation,  
hero or call to action, keep a consistent container width to  
ensure good use of horizontal alignment, because it makes it  
easier for users to scan the page.  
# do  
Do keep them align with the navigation.  
Do keep 30px of padding from left and right side. centered horizontal alignment  
When you don’t have multiple elements or large amounts  
of text you can make use of centered horizontal alignment,  
keep in mind that in most cases text and content should be  
align to the left.

# CONSISTENCY  
Consistency in web design refers to keeping all of the ele-  
ments \(fonts, icons, imagery, etc.\) the same throughout the  
website.  
This is important because a consistent site or app lets the  
user transfer knowledge they already had collected and ap-  
ply it on other sections within your site or app.  
When a UI works in a consistent manner, it becomes  
predictable \(in a good way\), which means users can under-  
stand how to use certain functions intuitively and without  
instruction.  
Abstract representation of consistent elements  
being displayed design creates culture.  
# culture shapes values.  
Values determine the future.— Robert L. Peters consistency in colors  
Keep colors consistent with their function \(i.e., green always  
means Accept and red Reject\).  
Colors usually mean something, within your website or  
app try to keep the overall color scheme consistent by not  
changing the meaning of your colors.  
# don’t  
Don’t change primary actions colors as they might  
confuse users on the meaning behind that action. For example, if your primary color is blue and primary ac-  
tions like save, add have that color, make sure to make all  
primary actions look the same.  
# do  
Do make sure primary actions have the same color  
throughout your site, this makes the user learn  
that XYZ color on a button means he is about to  
perform an important action. consistency in TYPOGRAPHY  
Consistent typography helps to create a complete and co-  
herent website, this is why it’s crucial to set apart headlines,  
bodies, and secondary texts by giving  
them each a distinct typography.  
A good rule of thumb is to stick to a maximum of two fonts  
and use one for main headers/titles and the rest for the  
body text.

# a way of  
life— Alan Fletcher consistency in Layout and location  
A consistent layout throughout an app or website makes it  
easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking  
for effortlessly.  
Make sure to follow industry standards, e.g. people are used  
to finding a sign in button on the upper right corner side of  
a website. By doing so users will feel already familiar with  
your app or website even if they haven’t interacted with it  
before.  
# don’t  
Don’t remove the sidebar on specific pages, users  
are used to rely on it therefore removing it results  
in confused and probably lost users. An inconsistent layout confuses users and makes it difficult to find what they are looking for. It’s harder more  
for us-  
ers to remember things that often change than things that  
doesn’t.  
Removing components such as the sidebar might lead to  
dead end pages, where the user is unable to return to a  
known page.  
# do  
Do use the sidebar pattern for web apps on all  
pages to allow users to quickly find what they are  
looking for at all times. consistency in icons  
Icons are visually intuitive representations of actions or con-  
tent of your website, keeping consistency across them en-  
sures you always communicate the same thing.

# negative space  
Negative space refers to empty space between layouts,  
text, images, sections and other visual components.  
It’s crucial to have an appropriate amount of negative space  
as it increases readability and helps the users focus on the  
content that is most relevant.  
Negative space is usually composed by these three css  
properties\:  
1\. Margin  
2\. Padding  
3\. Letter spacing & line height  
Negative space acting as a visual cue two  
separate two groups. negative space in text  
Space between text is important because it improves read-  
ability and overall comprehension.  
You can improve negative space in text by making use of  
margins between chunks of texts and line height between  
lines of text.  
A good amount of line height is going to depend on the size  
of the font itself. There is not a unique number that works  
well for all text, but a good rule of thumb is of 1.5  
times the font size, and then you can adjust accordingly. don’t  
Don’t make text feel  
cluttered, this decreases  
overall readability and  
aesthetics.  
Don’t leave the same  
amount of negative space  
between lines and titles,  
there should be a closer  
gap between lines than the  
heading and the body text.  
# do  
Do leave generous amounts  
of white space between  
heading, subheading and  
body text.  
Do leave a balanced  
amount of white space  
between lines.  
E.g. font-size 16px, line height 16\*1.5 = 24px tips  
You can use this tool to generate appropriate line  
heights given a font size\:  
https\://grtcalculator.com/ Negative space to improve hierarchy  
When used wisely, negative space can support visual hier-  
archy by creating focal points.  
Be mindful that too much or too less negative space can  
disrupt the overall layout making the element look apart  
from its own group.  
# don’t  
Don’t leave too much white space as it makes  
elements look like they belong to different groups.  
Don’t leave too little space between text and  
background images. You can use negative space around an element, the more  
negative space the more attention the element will get.  
# do  
Do surround elements with appropriate negative  
space to bring in attention to them, e.g. the main  
button clearly draws the user’s attention almost  
immediately. Negative space and consistency  
Using consistent white space across elements and layouts  
is key to having a more aesthetic and balanced page.  
# don’t  
Don’t have different amounts of white space for  
the same component as it looks like there are two  
different groups, one on the top and the other one  
at the bottom. Inconsistent white space leads to abrupt changes in the UI  
that affect the overall flow of the page.  
# do  
Do keep the same amount of space between  
elements that belong to the same group. Negative space to declutter and  
# improve overall aesthetics  
Good use of whitespace helps to declutter your site or so that users can focus on important elements and read  
content easily.  
app,  
# don’t  
Don’t make elements touch or even come too  
close to the edges of the wrapper/container  
unless you are absolutely sure this will not  
disrupt reading and aesthetics. As a good rule of thumb never have elements touch the bor-  
ders of external containers like cards. Unless for very spe-  
cific cases, text and images should have a generous amount  
of white space around them, it makes it easier to read and  
scan content.  
# do  
Do leave a generous amount of white space  
around atomic elements like text or images and  
wrapper containers. Negative space between sections  
We know that negative space helps in bringing elements  
together, making them part of the same group, also large  
amounts of negative space make elements feel far  
apart, which translates in separating groups.  
# don’t  
Don’t leave little to no negative space between  
different sections as it makes it look they all  
belong to the same group, which might confuse  
the user on why different things are being  
presented close and which item to focus on first. When building sections on a website or app it’s crucial to  
know when to use large amounts of white space to separate  
groups. e.g. if two sections talk about different  
things and convey different messages it makes sense to  
leave a larger amount of negative space between them.  
# do  
Do keep larger amounts of negative space  
between different sections within a page, this  
gives time for the user to disassociate from  
previous sections. E.g. the call to action and the  
hero title. visual hierarchy  
# visual harmony  
Visual harmony in web design occurs when the elements are  
arranged in a manner that the overall design feels complete  
and cohesive.  
Putting all the previous principles together won’t work if we  
can’t find a balance/harmony that conveys a sense of satisfac-  
tion.  
Achieving visual harmony relies on the distribution of visual  
weight, which is the perceived weight of elements, how much  
each elements stands out in comparison to those around it. Symmetrical harmony  
Symmetrical harmony occurs when everything on one side  
mirrors the other side, therefore, the visual weight is distrib-  
uted evenly.  
Use symmetrical harmony when you want to convey a sense  
of stability and orderly look.  
Be mindful that too much symmetry can make a design look  
boring and dry.  
An abstract example showcasing symmetrical harmony. don’t  
Don’t over use symmetry as the site might become  
monotonous and boring.  
Don’t continuously space every section with the  
same symmetry, such us the post, the hero text  
and actions. do  
Do use symmetry in your designs when you want  
to convey a more professional, sophisticated look  
and feel.  
Do use alternative harmony layouts to create flow  
between sections. Asymmetrical Harmony  
Asymmetrical harmony happens when the elements are in-  
tentionally arranged in an asymmetrical manner.  
Use asymmetrical harmony when you need to create a more  
eye catching focal point or when you want to create a sense  
of movement.  
An abstract example showcasing asymmetrical harmony.  
One side of the composition might contain a dominant ele-  
ment, which could be balanced by a couple or more lesser  
focal points on the other side. Such as an image on the left  
and text on the right. design is the  
# silent embassador  
# of your brand  
— Paul Rand don’t  
Don’t have elements be presented in the same  
way trough out your page, mix them up from left  
to right to make it more aesthetic.  
Don’t continuously repeat section as that reduces  
the effect of aesthetic harmony can have and  
make the page repetitive causing users to lose  
interest. do  
Do use asymmetry in your design to convey a  
more modern and playful message. Radial harmony  
Radial harmony establishes a focal point and balances the  
rest of the composition around it. You can achieve this by  
placing objects, colors, textures, illustrations around the  
main focal point.  
# don’t  
Don’t display your elements without a clear  
balance, although this might be consider  
asymmetrical there is no clear pricing card the  
user should focus their attention to. Overall  
composition and aesthetics feels off. Radial harmony can be helpful to make a certain element  
stand out from the rest. Such as pricing pages where radial  
harmony causes users to focus on the recommended pricing  
option.  
# do  
Do use radial balance and contrast, to create a  
focal point in the center of the screen, by doing  
so users will have less time to think which is the  
main element on the page they should focus their  
attention to. Achieving harmony through colors  
Harmony in colors can be achieved by sticking to a simple  
rule\: use a baseline color ratio of 60% for the primary color,  
30% for the secondary color and 10% for the accent color.  
# don’t  
Don’t mix multiple colors, specially opposite  
colors as they often contribute to a cluttered and  
unbalanced interface. do  
\#ff008e \(30%\)  
\#9ba2ae \(60%\)  
Color palette\: \#2e528d \(10%\)  
Do use an appropriate amount of different colors  
\(ideally 2 or three tops\), this will help to create a  
more balance page. Achieving harmony between text  
# and images  
Harmony can be achieved by correctly placing text and im-  
ages so that one doesn’t overpower the other.  
# don’t  
Don’t position text that overlaps heavily between  
the image content which cause to lose the  
harmony between the text and the image. Harmony can be achieved by correctly placing text and im-  
ages so that one doesn’t overpower the other.  
One way to do this is by finding empty spaces in your main  
image and placing your text there, let’s take a look at an ex-  
ample.  
# do  
Do reposition text and image in a manner where  
both coexist in a harmonious way, where the text  
doesn’t overlap on the heavy elements of the  
image. There is no perfect ratio for the amount of text that should  
go with any given image, this highly depends on the compo-  
nent you are building, remember that balance and harmony  
can be found when either overpowers the other, let’s take a  
look at another example.  
# don’t  
Don’t place large amounts of texts next to images. If the text block is larger than the image, maybe is time to  
break it into smaller chunks with smaller images.  
# do  
Do balance the visuals and text for any given  
component. visual weight  
In web design visual weight refers to the perceived amount  
of weight an element has.  
It’s a powerful concept to understand in order to achieve  
harmony.  
When applied correctly visual weight can help us create fo-  
cal points to draw the user’s attention to.  
The main things that affect visual weight are\:  
1\. Size\: larger elements carry more weight than smaller  
elements.  
# don’t  
do 2\. Color\: some colors are perceived as weighing more than  
others. Red seems to be heaviest while yellow seems to be  
lightest.  
# don’t  
While the red color makes the user focus on the whole sec-  
tion, it reduces the users attention on the primary action.  
do 3\. Density\: mixing elements together into the same space  
gives more weight to that space. good design encourages

Create wireframes for page-specific content, layout  
and navigation required to support tasks a user wishes  
to complete.  
Make visual design guidelines that will serve as the  
base of your prototype.  
Convert your wireframes into high fidelity prototypes. DESIGN PROCESS wireframe  
Wireframes are usually simple, low fidelity layouts that  
helps to understand where navigational elements, texts and  
graphics will be placed.  
Once the wireframe is complete, it should convey a compre-  
hensive skeletal view of the entire web application.  
Wireframes are great at keeping our mind focus on solving  
one and only one problem at a time.  
Some of the advantages of working on a wireframe first are  
to\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Clarification\: Get a clear idea of where elements are  
going to be placed on the screen.  
Usability\: Get a clear sense if the usability of the prod-  
uct, by pointing out flaws on the architecture.  
Save time\: Find issues early on the process and solve  
them quickly, iterate fast.  
Validation\: make the business rules and interactions  
are visually supported. How to  
# CREATE aesthetic  
# wireframes?  
Remember the purpose of a low fidelity wireframe is to  
just sketch out a rough outline of where we think text and  
graphics will be needed to support the tasks and features  
of our web application.  
Having that in mind, here is a list of guidelines you can  
keep in mind in order to make a simple low fidelity wire-  
frame standout\:  
Avoid unnecessary clutter\:  
•  
Eliminate high fidelity images that might distract from  
the whole purpose of making a wireframe.  
•  
Don’t overuse color, choose different shades of gray,  
one primary color and one accent color to make cer-  
tain actions pop.  
•  
Don’t wait to have high fidelity text, either use plain  
boxes or lorem ipsum content, remember we are just  
attempting to get a fair idea of where everything will go  
and examine areas that require more thought or inves-  
tigation. don’t

# don’t  
Don’t use plain black and white or doodle style,  
neither can clearly communicate the final design.  
# do  
Do use different shades of gray to suggest  
different levels of hierarchy, e.g. a ligher shade  
of gray on a dark background conveyss more  
importance than a ligher shade of gray, the  
opossite happenss on a light background.  
Do use primary colors for those actions that you  
won’t stand out and outline or ghost button for  
secondary actions. 3\. Use proportional sizes\:  
# don’t  
Don’t neglect the size relationship between elements,  
one of the main goals of a wireframe is to stablish a  
proper hierarchy between. elements.  
# do  
Do use size carefully to convey proportions accurately,  
this will help you have a more clear vision of the page  
hierarchy. 4\. Communicate clearly\:  
Elements in a wireframe should be easily identified by non  
techinical users, meaning a button should look as close as  
possible to a button, inputs should convey that they are  
meant for the user to type something, etc.  
A good way of achieving this is to remove particular features  
for any given component until there is nothing left to re-  
move without affecting the perceived aspect of it. design is not for

life— Issey Miyake styleguide  
A style guide is a reference source where you put together  
all of the design elements that conform your website or web  
app. This includes a color palette, typography \(fonts and siz-  
es\), spacing, icons, imagery, components and all the visual  
language that is used throughout your website.  
Having a clear styleguide is important to consolidate all  
your design decisions. This helps to have a more consistent  
and clear vision across different pages within your website.  
A styleguide allows everyone to make sure they are using  
the same visual language, guaranteeing consistency across  
the application.  
A styleguide is for a designer the same that code guidelines  
are for developers. It helps setting clear visual conventions  
and guidelines throughout the life cycle of the project, mak-  
ing sure all team members will adopt them accordingly. Here are some of the most common elements that conform  
a styleguide\: COLORS  
Colors play a vital part in how your website and your brand  
are perceived and remembered. Therefore, you’ll want to  
make sure to define your essential primary colors, usually a  
maximum of three.  
A complete color palette includes at least primary, second-  
ary, tertiary, neutral and accent colors.  
•  
Primary Colors\: these are the colors that are specif-  
ic to the company and most likely are going to affect  
primary actions.  
•  
Secondary colors\: this colors complement the pri-  
mary colors and are used for less important actions.  
•  
Accent and neutral colors\: accent or highlight colors  
are those that can be applied to success, warning or  
danger actions. Neutral colors are those that can be  
used for passive backgrounds, titles or body text. TYPOGRAPHY  
Here is where you choose the sizes of all titles, colors and  
weight, compare them with each other and arrange them in  
the right hierarchy.  
First, you’ll need to include the font families and sizes for  
your main headings H1-H6, in addition to this you’ll want to  
include the font family and sizes for the body text.  
Font sizes should be written in pixels \(px\) and remain con-  
sistent across elements, you should also use progressive  
sizes such as 14px, 16px, 18px, or 20px, and avoiding inter-  
mediate sizes such as 15px.  
Second, it’s important to determine the line height, the  
character spacing and the color of the texts. You can  
choose different shades of your neutral colors for the text.  
For the line height and letter spacing its useful to enter large  
amounts of texts and play around with each other to see  
which one has the best readability. imagery  
Here is where you put every illustration and icon your web-  
site is going to use. You should also create some rules and  
guidelines regarding what kind of images to use on your  
website.  
In order to keep images consistent you might include pho-  
to editing preferences for backgrounds, filters, brightness,  
contrast, and more.  
Regarding icons, it’s important to add guidelines on where  
to use different styles of icons, for example line icons can  
be only used for primary navigation whereas solid icons are  
used in form elements and to support text. It’s also import-  
ant to state the different sizes of icons allowed in order to  
keep them consistent. spacing  
Spacing plays an important role of how elements are per-  
ceived by the user. Having a clear scale of spacing values  
helps in making the overall design more consistent.  
The spacing scale is what we are going to be using for mar-  
gin and padding properties, as well as to both vertical and  
horizontal edges.  
The scale should include small increments than you can use  
throughout your styleguide, for example, to determine the  
space between a label and an input element. components  
Once the main style definitions are in place, we should think  
about adding the main components of your app or website  
into the styleguide.  
These means everything related to the appearance, sizes,  
and states of buttons, form fields, form elements, navigation  
menus, notifications and alerts, cards, modals etc.  
You should also include the different states of those com-  
ponents, for example, a button element should also have  
the styles when the users hovers over it, when the button is  
disabled or where the button is waiting for an action to finish  
\(loading state\).  
Make sure your components align with the colors, spacing  
and fonts defined earlier in the styleguide.  
Every component used in your website should be added to  
the styleguide, and the styleguide should serve as the main  
source of truth for this components. styleguide  
# Use case  
In this section we’ll cover how to create a styleguide step  
by step, we’ll start by creating the logo, color palette and  
typography.  
Then we’ll create a basic section for the images and icons  
that we will be using, followed by a layout grid and we’ll end  
it by creating some basic guidelines for components such as  
inputs, buttons etc. creating the logo  
The styleguide should include the size, placement, and all  
the variations that are acceptable for the logo.  
This section of your style guide ensures your logo is used  
in the way you intended. It also prevents mistakes, like  
stretching, altering, condensing or re-aligning, that could  
send the wrong message. The only  
# important thing  
# about design is  
# how it relates to  
# people  
— Victor Joseph Papanek creating the  
# color palette  
The color palette is one of the most important aspects of a  
styleguide and speaks about the overall tone you want to  
communicate.  
You should include at least one primary color, the accent  
colors such as green, red, and yellow and the combination of  
shades that are used in, for example, the body text. creating the  
# typography  
The fonts and size that you use, just like your color palette,  
will convey the style of your brand.  
The \(weight / style / sizing\) must be included to establish  
the textual tone of your content.  
As a good rule of thumb, don’t include more than two fonts  
in any design, as this might become visually distracting for  
the user. imagery and  
# iconography  
This section should include everything related to images,  
illustrations and icons that you are going to be using on your  
website or app.  
Any guideline or rule regarding how to use them should be  
include here as well. These should be used  
as complementary  
illustrations for back-  
grounds and images. ui elements  
Your styleguide should be very clear about the design of the  
UI elements and how they should be implemented. Components have different states that should be  
conveyed on your styleguide, each with its particular  
properties \(sice, spacing, color, etc\).  
In our example, we not only display specifics about  
the default state of our button but also go through  
specifics on the different states a button can have  
such as hover, click. The more details on the design of our UI components,  
the better, this will help to set future guidelines for  
you and your team.  
Something we haven’t included in our inputs exam-  
ple, to make it a bit more concise, is how the compo-  
nent should manage different states such as, success,  
error, warning. These should definitely be in the style-  
guide. There are many different components or elements in  
the construction of a product or app, ant it is neces-  
sary to include them to help instruct colleagues how  
these should look when placed together. An example  
can be our pricing card, which is composed of multi-  
ple smaller components.  
All of the above will help improve communication,  
even when working alone. design system  
Time to put it all together with a design system. This design  
system is a collection of reusable components, design pat-  
terns, and other standards used throughout an organization  
to create a consistent visual language and user experience.  
A design system defines how components, UI elements, and  
design patterns are used and how they relate to each other.  
It also helps with consistency, scalability, and future-proof-  
ing.  
We will be basing this of Flowbite \(https\://flowbite.com\)  
which is the stepping stone to start using what you’ve  
learned witin this book. a design system

# entire platform  
— Drew Bridewell, Invision •  
A design system can include a variety of elements, such as\:  
Branding guidelines\: These specify  
how the product’s brand should be  
represented visually, including the use  
of its logo, colors, typography, and other  
visual elements. •  
Layout guidelines\: These specify  
how different types of content should  
be arranged on the page, including  
the use of grids, whitespace, and  
other layout elements. •  
Typography guidelines\: These specify the typefaces,  
font sizes, and other typographical elements that  
should be used in the product.danger actions.  
Neutral colors are those that can be used for passive  
backgrounds, titles or body text. •  
Color palette\: This specifies the colors that should be  
used in the product, and may include both a primary  
palette for key UI elements and a secondary palette  
for less important elements. •  
Iconography\: This specifies the symbols, icons, and  
other graphical elements that should be used in the  
product.  
The icons used in FlowBite are the SVG-powered Hero Icons built by one of  
the creators of Tailwind CSS. •  
Interactive elements\: These specify how different UI  
elements should behave when interacted with, such  
as buttons, forms, and other interactive elements. •  
Components\: These are pre-designed UI elements  
that can be reused throughout the product, such as  
buttons, input fields, and other common elements. •  
Templates\: These are pre-designed page layouts that  
can be used as a starting point for creating new pages  
or sections of the product.  
The goal of a design system is to create a consistent and  
cohesive user experience across all parts of the product,  
and to make it easier for designers and developers to create  
new features and pages for the product. Let’s take a look of some advantages of building and using a  
design system\:  
1\. Consistency\: A design system helps to ensure that  
the product has a consistent look and feel across all  
of its pages and features. This can help to create a  
cohesive user experience and build trust with the 2\. Efficiency\: With a design system in place, designers  
and developers don’t have to start from scratch every  
time they need to create a new page or feature. They  
can use the pre-designed elements and templates  
provided by the design system to save time and effort. 3\. Flexibility\: A design system can be designed to be  
flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of  
products and features. This means that it can be used  
as the foundation for a variety of products, rather  
than having to create a new design system for each  
product.  
4\. Scalability\: As a product grows and evolves over time,  
a design system can help to ensure that new features  
and pages fit seamlessly into the overall design of the  
product. This can help to avoid design inconsistencies  
as the product scales. Building a design system from scratch is a task often carried  
out by a group of people and it can take years to complete  
\(although it is never fully completed, it evolves over time\).  
Big companies like airbnb, github develop and evolve their  
design system tailored to their products, bear in mind  
that these design systems are created with a very specific  
application and user base in mind.  
Building a design system takes a lot of time and effort, so  
it’s likely that startups or small companies don’t have this in  
place. Here is were looking for already stablished design  
systems pays off. You don’t have to worry about spending  
months \(or even years\) building it, making sure you are  
applying every best practice available out there, luckly for  
us there are design system solutions, that can be adjusted  
to pretty much any application.  
This is where Flowbite comes into play. Flowbite  
Flowbite \(https\://flowbite.com\) is the most popular open-  
source component library built with the utility classes from  
Tailwind CSS.  
It is an ecosystem of tools such as a Figma design system  
and a Tailwind components library, that you can just plug  
and play into your app or website.  
All of the elements are built using the utility classes from  
Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript. This means that is su-  
per easy to customize, you can add your own colors, fonts,  
sizings, shadows, and other styles to the default set of utili-  
ty classes from FlowBite and Tailwind CSS. We briefly mention that Flowbite gives you a Figma design  
system that you can use to test and build different designs.  
You can choose from a wide range of built in components  
such as dropdowns, tables, buttons and drag and drop  
them into your own design. You can even tweak them to fit  
you design style.  
Once you have your figma files ready to be implemented,  
you can simply import such components into your applica-  
tion, this means you don’t have to build them from scracth.  
This will not only save you months of works, but also you  
can rest asure that your UI is following best practices all  
around, accessibility, colors, contrast etc.  
Let’s get a feel of how we can easily use Flowbite from de-  
sign to implemantaion shall we? Building a Landing page in figma  
# using Flowbite’s design system  
First, let’s make sure we have the design system file open in  
Figma \(https\://figmadesignurl.com\). This file contains all of  
the design elements, such as colors, typography, icons, and  
UI components, that we will need to use to design our UI.  
Next, create a new file in Figma for your UI design. You can  
do this by clicking the “File” menu and selecting “New File”.  
Let’s call it Flowbite login form.  
In your new file, you can start building out your UI using  
the design elements from the design system file. You can  
do this by dragging and dropping UI components from the  
design system file into your new file, and then customizing  
them as needed. Let’s go ahead and create a desktop frame and select a nice  
background color from flowbite colors page.  
Let’s choose the darkest shade of gray, and now lets go to  
the assets tab and search for the Navbar component. Next, lets drag and drop the element into our frame. From  
here we can right on the element and select “detach from  
instance”. Given that the navbar is a Flowbite component, if  
we want to change anything we need to either change the  
base component which will reflect the changes to all in-  
stances of the component, or we can detach this instance  
from the component itself and customize it as we please.  
Once detatched we can adjust the size to take up the full  
width of our frame. Each component has different variants, breakpoints and  
even theme modes. Given that I want this UI to be dark,  
I’ll toggle the Dark Mode switch on the upper right section,  
just below the Navbar select. This changes the colors of the  
background and foreground of the navbar to adjust it to a  
dark theme. For the next part, I want to have a nice heading, similar to  
the one on the flowbite marketing site, so let’s create a text  
layer \(shortcut T\)  
And let’s add a Title for this I’ll add the following text “Build  
websites even faster with components on top of Tail-  
wind CSS” but you can add whatever you want.  
Next lets go to the middle right section where the text styles  
live, and select the Header style, the one that has 34pt.  
Let’s center align the text, and center it in the frame.\*\* You should be seeing something like this\: Let’s repeat this process for a smaller text now, create a text  
layer, add some text and change the text style to be text-xl  
font-normal this time. I’ll change the color to be gray/400 and reduce the size to  
be around 840px. After centering the text in the viewport  
just below our main header you should have something like  
this\: Next lets see how easy it is to add a Get started primary  
button right below our paragraph. Lets go to the asstets  
section on the upper left side and search for button. Let’s  
grab the main button component \(the blue one\) and drag  
and drop it to the frame.  
Now with the button selected, on the right side panel you  
can see all of the button’s variants that we can play with.  
You can choose the color, the size, even the icons that the  
button will have. For now just copy this settings. Let’s repeat the same process but this time lets add a sec-  
ondary button with this settings\: Buttons are an excellent example of the different variants  
a flowbite component can have. These are easily customiz-  
able and extensible. These are some examples of flowbite blocks\:  
Pricing page  
Features section Create modal Now we should have something like this\:  
I hope that with this quick tutorial on how to use flowbite  
design system in figma you get a feel of how easy it would  
be to create custom websites or apps using this. The best  
part is that when you have to code this components you can  
use one of their UI libraries and just import the same com-  
ponents you use in Figma.  
In addition to this, flowbite has its own section of Blocks,  
which are entire websites and pages that you can just plug  
and play into your UI https\://flowbite.com/blocks/ I encourage you to keep on building upon this landing page  
and try out different styles and components that flowbite  
has to offer. final thoughts  
I hope you’ve enjoyed the book and now you feel confident  
to put in practice what you learned to create awesome web-  
sites and products.  
Now that you are familiar with these web design princi-  
ples, you have everything you need to create something that  
looks and functions well. As you get experience over time,  
don’t be afraid to break and play around with some of these  
rules. Web design is continuously changing, evolving, and  
It’s likely that you won’t be able to follow each practice ex-  
actly, so don’t worry if you need to adapt some principles to  
the nature of your website.  
But now before bending these rules, you will be aware that  
they exist, what is their purpose, and accomodate them to  
your website accordingly, that is what makes a great web
