# Event Studies  
Fully updated and revised in its fifth edition, Event Studies remains the most comprehensive book devoted  
to developing knowledge and theory about event management and event tourism, focusing on the study of  
events, the event experience, and the meanings associated with them.  
International in scope and embellished with useful figures and tables throughout, the authors carefully  
examine current forces, trends, and issues, including impacts of the pandemic. All the major types of  
planned events are profiled, with emphasis on their forms, functions, experiential dimensions, meanings,  
and values. This book’s framework encompasses antecedents, planning and design, outcomes and impacts,  
and the various patterns and processes that influence the events sector, including policy.  
New and expanded topics in the fifth edition include\:  
l Content has been substantially reorganised to give much more attention to establishing theoretical  
foundations and advocating principles for the core management functions.  
l New content on gender studies, human rights, crisis management and resilience, sustainability, and  
events as agents of change.  
l Expert opinion boxes cover major issues\: educational philosophy; technology and its impacts; human  
rights and mega-events; virtual events and agile management; trends in corporate events; happiness  
and well-being; event portfolios management; civic dramaturgy; event design; trends in communica-  
tions, including new media; dynamic crowd ­ management; overtourism; and event-sector recovery.  
l Additional chapters on design, policy, management fundamentals, planning and operations, event tour-  
ism, and the inter-related management challenges of risk, security, health and safety, and environment.  
This insightful volume will be an invaluable resource for all undergraduate students of events studies  
throughout their degree programmes.

17.1 Dr. Sandra Goh\: Event Sector Recovery in New Zealand 420 Preface to the Fifth Edition  
This fifth edition of Event Studies brings substantial revisions and a re-organisation. Some  
­ material has been reduced or removed, and a considerable amount of new material added. One  
new theme is quite evident, that being crisis management, recovery, and resilience – topics of  
global importance as a result of the pandemic and other contemporary crises that impact event  
studies. This book starts with a review of global forces, trends, and issues, reflecting the United  
Nations’ sustainability goals.  
More, and shorter chapters should give greater flexibility to instructors. Not all instructors  
will want students to read the entire book, and students will have an easier time reading  
each chapter, with its own learning objectives and study guide. Management content has been  
expanded, with Chapters 7 through 15 covering the fundamentals of event management and  
event tourism, making this book more versatile. These chapters introduce theories, principles,  
and some methods but do not substitute for the how-to detail in other, specialised textbooks.  
Research Notes, which were abstracts of published articles, have been replaced by updated  
citations through early 2023. In several places, there are chronological lists of pertinent sources  
right in the text. Also, see the final chapter for a review of review articles. Expert Opinions have  
been kept and updated, and these also include valuable references. At the end of each chapter  
is a Further Reading section where pertinent books are recommended.  
Profiles are a new feature. The intent is to provide an example of different types of events and  
to illustrate major themes, with photos where possible. These are not case studies, but several  
of them refer to published research articles or book chapters, and others to lengthy case studies  
from this book\: V. Ziakas and D. Getz \(Eds.\) \(2023\), Cases in Event Management and Event Tourism,  
Goodfellow Publishers. Those contributed cases come with Teaching Notes, and that book’s  
companion website provides instructors with exam questions and answers.  
The first six chapters provide an overview of Event Studies, including forces and trends, clas-  
sifications, discussion of experiences and meanings, and profiles of event types and asso-  
ciated experiences. The middle section is oriented towards professional practice. The third  
section is again academic in nature, with a chapter summarising foundation disciplines and  
closely related fields, followed by the concluding chapter on research and knowledge creation.  
The final chapter contains an updated summary of reviews and research agenda, as well as a  
short commentary on future perspectives. Acknowledgements

# Introduction  
The world is full of bad news, but planned events offer relief and hope. Events carry good  
news in the form of celebration, creativity, and commemoration of the best humanity has  
to offer. Events offer entertainment and diversion, fun and frolic, but also learning and

exchanges, human and community development, and memorable and rewarding experiences.  
Every professional in the world of producing and managing planned events seeks to offer  
the best of art, sport, commerce, and entertainment through continuous improvement and  
sustainable practices. But we cannot ignore the bad news.  
This fifth edition of Event Studies has been prepared in a time of crisis and ongoing recovery,  
with sustainability and resilience being elevated to absolute priorities for the entire events sec-  
tor. When the global Covid-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020, no one was prepared for the  
ensuing worst-case scenario. All over the world travel came to a halt, and events were cancelled  
indefinitely or postponed to dates that later became unviable. Uncertainty prevailed. Venues  
were shut down, and event organisations and companies either failed outright or entered into  
a crisis mode. The term superspreader event entered the vernacular, while virtual and hybrid events  
took on new importance. Many jobs were lost, and volunteer positions entered a hiatus. We all  
speculated on what this would mean for future employment opportunities and event viability.  
Impacts and responses to the pandemic did vary from country to country and city to city, but  
uniformly it was an unprecedented disaster in economic and social terms.  
By late 2022, the events sector was rebounding. Travel, albeit experiencing recovery pains such  
as delays and cancellations, had been strongly renewed. Events were held, and demand was  
strong. It appeared that things were returning to normal – but of necessity, a new normal, one  
in which structural changes were occurring and everyone was forced to focus on resilience.  
As we entered 2023, Covid-19 and its new variants were still active, but the pandemic was not  
completely over. The World Health Organisation declared the global emergency to be ended,  
but experts warned of rebounds and of possibly worse viral plagues in the future.  
In January of 2023, the World Tourism Organisation claimed Tourism Set to Return to Pre-Pandemic  
Levels in Some Regions in 2023, namely, Europe and the Middle East \(source\: https\://www.unwto.  
org/news/tourism-set-to-return-to-pre-pandemic-levels-in-some-regions-in-2023\) following a  
stronger-than-expected rebound in the previous year. Continued geopolitical and economic  
uncertainty was constraining the resilience of tourism on a global level. Asia and the Pacific  
regions were the slowest to recover pre-pandemic flows.  
Much research will be required to determine the full effects of the pandemic, both good and  
bad, and this is a new theme incorporated in the fifth edition. It fits with established themes,  
including strategy, portfolio management, sustainability, and impact assessment, but requires  
increased emphasis on risk and crisis management, and agility and resilience.  
The global pandemic was not the only major problem facing travel, leisure, events, and hospi-  
tality in the 2020–2023 period. Although economic revival has been a dominant policy goal,  
the pandemic interrupted supply chains, leading to inflation and fears of food shortages and a  
global recession. The Russian invasion of Ukraine raised serious questions about the stability  
of the world order, throwing Europe and NATO into defensive mode, with the added problem  
of accommodating millions of refugees from a neighbouring country. This has been in addition  
to ongoing mass migration from impoverished, war-torn, and politically unstable regions, the  
latest example \(as of June 2023\) being war-torn Sudan.  
Climate change has been wreaking havoc on many parts of the globe through severe storms,  
heat waves, and resulting fires, flooding, or water shortages – all tastes of what is to come with  
increasing severity. Carbon reduction has become a basic policy for many, yet dependence on  
fossil fuels is being perpetuated by governments seeking to lower disruptive energy prices, and  
because of the lack of alternatives. Introduction and Overview of Event Studies 3  
Event-related disasters were also a regrettable theme in 2022, especially in October.  
Oct. 2022\: Indonesian soccer fans were crushed during a chaotic run for the exits, leaving at  
least 125 people dead, after police used teargas.  
Oct. 2022\: Over 150 young people were killed in the Seoul, Korea Halloween disaster. It has  
been attributed to uncontrolled crowd size, inadequate police presence, and the difficulty of  
emergency vehicles had in accessing the site. This was an unplanned event, for the most part,  
but from a risk planning and management perspective every event must take heed of the les-  
sons to be learned \(see Chapter 13 for details\).  
So bad was the period 2020–2022 that some commentators were using the term polycrisis to  
describe cascading disruptions, while the Collins Dictionary word-of-the-year was permacrisis,  
describing a new world order in which there is no short-term relief from serious problems and  
pressures.  
# Global Issues for 2023 and Beyond  
The United Nations Foundation posted five global issues \(https\://unfoundation.org/blog/  
post/5-global-issues-to-watch-in-2023/\), and these should be understood in concert with the  
UN’s seventeen sustainability goals \(https\://sdgs.un.org/goals\). As of mid-2022, The Sustainable  
Development Goals Report 2022 concluded that multiple, interlinked crises threatened attainment  
of the goals and that urgent action was needed to rescue the plan and show meaningful progress  
before 2030. Table 1.1 combines these global themes and applies them to Event Studies.

# The Nature and Scope of Event Studies  
Event Studies is the academic field devoted to creating knowledge and theory about planned  
events, including their management and their roles in tourism and other development strategies  
\(see Figure 1.1\). The scope of Event Studies spans small-group celebrations and community  
festivals, commemorations, sports, business meetings and exhibitions, academic and scientific  
gatherings, religious pilgrimages and sacred rites, entertainment, and political or governmental  
events. Of necessity, it must also encompass many unplanned events and events at the margin.  
An academic field of knowledge requires a unique core phenomenon as the principal focus for  
academic inquiry, this being all events and related experiences, and the meanings attached to  
both. We use the term planned events deliberately, even though we are interested in other forms  
of mass assembly and social gatherings. The reason is that the term event, on its own, has many  
other uses, such as news events and weather events.  
Event Studies draws from a large number of foundation disciplines and closely related profes-  
sional fields, and the interconnections between these areas of study. This fosters interdisci-  
plinary theory focused on planned events to better understand why they exist, and how we  
can manage them better to derive positive outcomes, as well as minimise undesirable and  
unforeseen consequences.  
Event Studies is defined by its holistic approach towards events as a phenomenon, including all  
the issues surrounding planned events, in addition to their management, design, and produc-  
tion. Events have policy implications that cannot be ignored, and those are not the sole domain  
of event producers and managers. This begins to illustrate why the study of planned events is  
both a fascinating and essential feature of post-modern societies – so much so that it is impos-  
sible to imagine modern societies without a full range of events, event facilities, and managed  
portfolios of events by cities, tourism agencies, and private corporations.  
*The Experience Economy and Planned Events*  
We live in an age when the experiences offered by planned events are in high demand, witness  
the rebound of events all over the world in 2022–2023 following an almost complete absence  
of two years. Events have been legitimised as essential ingredients of modern life, especially in 6  
Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
cities, as instruments of numerous public policy fields, and as tools in corporate and tourism  
marketing. They are therefore expected and necessary platforms for a wide range of desired  
experiences.  
Pine and Gilmore’s \(1999\) book The Experience Economy advanced the notion that we have  
evolved beyond the service economy. They argued that businesses need to create experiences  
that are memorable – embodying entertainment, education, aesthetics, immersion, and escapism. Many  
subsequent authors have applied and expanded these principles within the events sector \(e.g.,  
Darvishmotevali et al., 2023; Page and Connell, 2010; Smit and Melissen, 2018; Sundbo and  
Sørensen, 2013\). Events should be designed to allow participants and audiences to engage in  
discrete ways ranging from absorption to immersion. Such experiences must accommodate  
different modes of participation, from passive to very active forms of involvement. They also  
need to engage all of our senses.  
*The Digital Economy and Planned Events*  
The experience economy continues to grow and evolve in concert with the digital economy, facil-  
itating more pop-up events and immersive experiences involving augmented reality. Online  
communities can form their own events, and social media influencers shape expectations. Con-  
sumers in the experience economy hopefully become loyal to particular brands, and even more  
important, become ambassadors or influencers for the brand. That is good for retailing, but not  
the more profound transformations we want to facilitate through planned events. As will be  
discussed, transformative experiences relate to personal growth, spirituality, well-being, and health.  
Applied to the group or community level, we talk about events as agents of systemic change.  
The digital economy is more than e-commerce and virtual events, and it refers to the network-  
ing of the world through technology, facilitating all kinds of exchanges. This has also been called  
a revolution in terms of IC – information and communications. Applied to the events sector,  
the benefits of going digital are many. The importance of being online with a great website is  
well established, including having universal booking opportunities \(i.e., being able to purchase  
tickets and travel packages for events from anywhere\), but there are other opportunities for  
events and e-commerce. These include merchandise sales, fundraising through virtual events,  
engaging potential customers, and maintaining loyal customers through inter-connectivity of  
all stakeholders. As content providers, events can package their experiences \(e.g., entertain-  
ment\), knowledge base \(how to do things\), and problem-solving through consulting. New  
career opportunities are emerging, including designers of virtual and hybrid experiences and  
content creators. Another feature of the digital economy is the rise of user-generated content  
and the co-creation of experiences, including events that are organised by and for online com-  
munities of interest.  
Hassan \(2022\), writing in the book Technology Application in Tourism Fairs, Festivals and Events in  
Asia, advised on how technology is revolutionising event planning and experiences.  
He asserted \(p. vi\) that “...hyper technology enables event festival organizers to plan high-quality  
events and services while also adding value to the consumer experience in a variety of ways,  
including genuine information, ease of event booking, updated knowledge, and other aspects”.  
*Education for, and the Evolution of Event Studies*  
In the first edition of this book, a pyramid-shaped model was presented. Event Studies was at  
the pinnacle, resting on a foundation of degree and diploma programmes for the burgeoning Introduction and Overview of Event Studies 7  
field of event management. The growth of educational programmes was attributed primarily  
to the many career opportunities in the events sector. The principal argument was that Event  
Studies as a field could not exist without this foundation, and that it mostly relied on teachers  
and researchers within the event management field. This is no longer the complete picture,  
as Event Studies can now stand on its own, not merely as a supplement to more career and  
business-oriented education.  
In the new framework \(see Figure 1.1\), Event Studies is all-encompassing and interdisciplinary.  
It is not necessarily dependent upon closely related applied fields and professional activities.  
Event Studies draws upon traditional and emerging disciplines and fields, and in return informs  
and expands their content and theories. Similar to the arguments put forward by Tribe \(2004,  
2006\) regarding tourism studies, we are working within a field of study. One’s perspective on  
events, whether academic or practical, will determine which disciplines, contributing fields,  
methods, and theories one draws upon. An interest in the impacts of mega events on housing,  
for example, could draw upon sociology, urban planning, and political science. An interest in  
the nature of festival sustainability will use ecology, management theory, social psychology, and  
other sources.  
To create event-related knowledge, the contributions of theory and methodologies from mul-  
tiple disciplines are required. Where a number of disciplines are drawn upon, we can say that  
the new field of study is multidisciplinary in nature. With time, the interactions might establish  
a field of knowledge with its own theories and methodologies, and this can be said to be inter-  
disciplinary in nature. Seraphin \(2021\) has gone even farther, arguing for a postdisciplinary per-  
spective in Event Studies in which disciplinary boundaries are ignored and researchers become

eclectic in their methodologies. At this stage in its evolution, we can say that Event Studies  
is now contributing back to the foundation disciplines and other professional and academic  
fields with new understandings and theories in development, some of which are highlighted  
throughout this book.  
Dredge et al. \(2014\) advocated a diverse core curriculum for tourism, hospitality, and events.  
Also drawing upon Tribe \(2014\) and Barnett \(1990\), we present six basic requirements for  
advanced education related to events\:  
1 A deep understanding of some knowledge claims \(this brings ontology into the picture, that  
is, what we collectively claim to know about planned events\).  
2 A radical critique of knowledge claims \(do not take all claims as given, but challenge them;  
see the discussion of Critical Event Studies\).  
3 Competence to develop critique in the company of others \(being able to engage in various  
discourses, such as the meaning and importance of events\).  
4 Self-direction and independent inquiry \(knowing where you want to go and how to get there  
with regard to learning and professionalism; developing a lifelong learning capability\).  
5 Self-reflection \(intellectuals and professionals always think carefully about what they are  
doing, why they are doing it, and potential outcomes; do we have enough information or  
theory? What can we learn from evaluation?\).  
6 Open dialogue and cooperation \(being part of a free, professional community, and a respon-  
sible citizen\).  
In considering the divergent directions taken by liberal education versus vocational training,  
Dredge et al. \(2014\) argued that each teaching institution should engage in a dynamic process  
of curriculum design that results in differences, thereby facilitating innovation. Those teaching  
Event Studies, or applied event tourism and event management, should not only combine some  
elements of training with more theoretical and philosophical subjects but also develop the stu-  
dent’s capability for lifelong learning.  
Starting with some basic skills and simple concepts, educational programmes can add more  
complex knowledge and expert practices as appropriate and for competitive advantage. The  
professional event manager or event tourism planner has to have more than skills. Profession-  
als must have a broad base of knowledge, together with the ability to reflect upon how it will  
shape both specific managerial or business decisions and the wider implications of events in  
society and the environment. They also have to possess a well-developed sense of ethics and  
professional responsibility, which should be based on a solid foundation that includes philoso-  
phy and comparative cultural studies.  
Tourism education can be traced back as far as the 1930s, with substantial growth in the 1980s.  
Event Studies has more recent origins, and some of the drivers of growth are shown in Figure 1.2.  
Two distinct and potentially complementary approaches to events-related research and educa-  
tion developed in tandem, with increasing interdependence\:  
l An interdisciplinary approach, which was based upon the theoretical and intellectual basis of  
higher education, with a philosophical approach underpinned by traditional disciplines and  
new subject areas \(we call it Event Studies\).  
l The professional bodies approach, which is based on competencies and skills, with factual  
knowledge and problem-solving at the heart of the curriculum \(both Event Management  
and Event Tourism\). Introduction and Overview of Event Studies 9

Figure 1.2 Key Drivers of Growth in Event Education  
The review of literature contained in the last chapter of this book demonstrates how the  
field has grown and diversified, and that is also evident in the many references contained in  
this book. As Formica \(1998\) observed, there were few articles related to events manage-  
ment or event tourism published in the 1970s – he found only four in the Annals of Tourism  
Research and the Journal of Travel Research \(JTR\). Events were not yet considered to be attrac-  
tions within the tourism system of Gunn’s landmark book, Tourism Planning \(1979\). In the  
1960s and 1970s, the events sector was not recognised as an area of separate study within  
leisure, tourism, or recreation, all of which were rapidly growing in the academic commu-  
nity and in professional practice. Accordingly, one of the landmarks in the development of  
Event Studies was the establishment in 1993 of the research journal Festival Management  
and Event Tourism – now named Event Management – by Donald Getz and Bruce Wicks. Prior  
to its founding, the published literature on events was small and contained mostly within  
foundation disciplines or the closely related fields of tourism and leisure studies. There are  
now several journals devoted to events, including International Journal of Festival and Event  
Management, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, Journal of Festive Studies, and in part the  
Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events. Several others have, over the years,  
ceased operations. As demonstrated by citations throughout this book, many other research  
journals have published large numbers of relevant papers. The review of review articles in  
the final chapter reveals growth in numbers, diversity, and sophistication, as well as gaps  
and emerging themes.  
The Routledge four-volume collection of key studies in the field, Event Tourism \(Connell and  
Page, 2010\), is significant because this compendium traced the evolution of Event Studies back  
to the 1920s with Allix’s \(1922\) publication on fairs. One might also argue that the profes-  
sional field of event management pre-dates the academic study of this phenomenon, as the first  
convention and visitors bureau \(CVB\) was established in the USA in Detroit in 1896 \(Ford and  
Peeper, 2007\). Interestingly, as Ford and Peeper found, there were also examples, pre-dating  
Detroit, of attracting meetings and convention business to towns and cities, facilitated by the 10  
Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
spread of the railroad in the USA. Therefore, the academic study of the professional events  
sector has taken several hundreds of years to reach fruition, and if sporting events such as the  
Olympiad are included, then their management and organisation – as opposed to their philo-  
sophical rationale – can be dated back to early civilisations.  
In 1990, a landmark year in the event management literature, Goldblatt’s book Special Events\:  
The Art and Science of Celebration was published, followed by Festivals, Special Events and Tour-  
ism \(Getz, 1991\) and a year later, Hallmark Tourist Events by C. M. Hall \(1992\). In the early  
1990s, academics were clearly leading the way, as at that time there were few if any degree  
programmes, and few courses available anywhere that featured event management or event  
tourism. In the USA, George Washington University pioneered event management education,  
leading Hawkins and Goldblatt \(1995\), in a journal article, to address the need for event man-  
agement education. Interestingly, their article also asked how events should be treated within  
a tourism curriculum.  
The mid- to late-1990s were the take-off years for the academic institutionalisation of event  
management, and with it a more legitimised advancement of scholarship on event tourism and  
Event Studies. There is also no doubt that leisure, tourism, and hospitality provided a large  
part of the foundation, having adapted discipline-based theory and methodology, supporting  
event-specific courses, and spinning off event management degree programmes. The literature  
on events has now grown beyond anyone’s capability of reading it all, with a number of dis-  
tinct specialisations having emerged. In very practical terms, this probably defines maturity, or  
at least the path towards maturity in the field. The longstanding divisions based on types of  
events remain \(i.e., separating sports events, business events, and festivals\). The Olympics will  
always attract its own scholarship, while world fairs and other mega events retain their allure  
for researchers and authors – many examples are cited throughout this book.  
*Community of Practice for Event Professionals*  
Brown and Stokes \(2021\) considered event management to be a domain which connects  
professionals to a community of practice. They framed this position within the idea that  
there is an evolving events industry, and that event management is a professional and aca-  
demic discipline that has emerged from related fields such as tourism, leisure, marketing,  
and hospitality. Key elements of a community of practice were observed in their qualitative  
research in the UK, namely, distinct modes of working, shared values and practices, and  
shared identity.  
Academic degree programmes, professional bodies, efficient modes of information dissemina-  
tion, and standards imposed by the government, professional bodies, or industry associations  
can certainly help to foster a sense of community. This is likely to be realised more quickly  
in a nation like the UK where there is a high density of institutions teaching Event Studies  
and management, and well-connected professional groups such as the AEME \(Association for  
Events Management Education \(https\://www.aeme.org\)\). Similarly, the CAUTHE \(Council  
for Australasian Tourism and Hospitality Education \(CAUTHE.org\)\) represents institutions  
and professionals in tourism, hospitality, and events sectors. In North America, there are  
many state and provincial associations devoted to events, and the International Festivals and  
Events Association \(IFEA.com\) provides an umbrella organisation. Events and professionals  
also have the option of joining more tightly defined associations such as Meetings Profession-  
als International \(mpi.org\). See Table 9.3 for others, including their certification or diploma  
programmes. Introduction and Overview of Event Studies *The Need for Greater Internationalisation and Cross-cultural Studies*  
The English language dominates when it comes to publications related to Event Studies, event  
management, and event tourism. However, Richards et al. \(2022\) concluded that a considerable  
amount of pertinent knowledge was being created and published in other languages, resulting  
in a missing body of knowledge. The emphases are different from country to country, and the  
hosting of mega events has influenced both the number of papers and the focus of research  
interests. The researchers examined event management journal articles in eight non-English  
languages \(not including Chinese\) and analysed them according to the framework used in this  
book \(i.e., Figure 1.3\). Their conclusion was that most of the articles dealt with outcomes and  
impacts, plus patterns and processes. This finding can be compared with the results of a study  
of English-language publications on event management \(Yeung and Thomas, 2021\) wherein  
patterns and processes were most important over the entire period of 2009–2019, and anteced-  
ents and decision-making relatively more important.  
All over the world, scholars are publishing in English-language journals for both prestige and  
out of necessity, as academics are typically compelled to seek the highest-ranked journals in  
their fields. Richards et al. \(2022\) discussed a number of remedies, but it seems likely this  
bias in the literature will continue for some time. What we have done in this book, where  
feasible, is to highlight publications that pertain to non-English-speaking countries, a practice  
that reveals a very large amount of event-related research being done in, or concerning Asia.

Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
The widening geographical scope of Event Studies is also reflected in a number of books,  
including Tourism Events in Asia\: Marketing and Development, edited by Hassan and Sharma \(2018\),  
and Sharma et al. \(2022\), Festival and Event Tourism\: Building Resilience and Promoting Sustainability.  
*Critical Event Studies*  
Critical studies involves those who question established paradigms, in other words, the existing  
practices and concepts used within a discipline or subject \(Robertson et al, 2018\). A more  
reflective approach to understanding society, and the issues it examines, is sought. Traditionally,  
these ideas have evolved from political ideologies such as Marxism, and more recently the work  
of Habermas \(1973, 1975\) as a proponent of critical social theory. For Event Studies, this means  
that critical social scientists approach the phenomenon of events from a very different stand-  
point, often focusing on power and inequalities.  
Critical Event Studies have been expanding rapidly. Spracklen and Lamond \(2016\), in their  
edited book Critical Event Studies, argued that events are very much a neo-liberal form of com-  
modified experience. Those authors considered protests as events, with activism as a form of  
leisure activity. They viewed protests as being part of a counter-hegemonic struggle, meaning  
they are a challenge to the status quo, in political terms. Lamond and Pratt’s \(2016\) edited col-  
lection of research approaches in events provides numerous illustrations of the methodologies  
and application of Critical Event Studies from different disciplines such as qualitative methods  
\(Dowse, 2016\), cultural studies \(Ying-Chih, 2016\), disability studies \(Misener et al., 2016\),  
and ethnography \(Dashper, 2016\). Other studies such as Finkel et al. \(2019b\) on accessibility,  
inclusion, and diversity in events also expand the domain of Critical Event Studies, especially  
their focus on gender, sexualities, ethnicities, age, class, religion, and the relationship with  
non-mainstream, non-majority communities. Jepson and Clarke edited the book Power, Con-  
struction and Meaning in Festivals \(2018\) with the purpose of taking a critical look at the links  
between festivals and authenticity, cultural consumption, and local communities.  
Accessibility, Inclusion, and Diversity in Critical Event Studies, a book edited by Finkel, Sharp, and  
Sweeney \(2019b\), provided several important insights. First, accessibility is more than a phys-  
ical design consideration \(i.e., catering for a range of disabilities\), and it also applies to real  
or perceived class and cultural barriers. Inclusion, to critical theorists, can only be assured  
through interventions and a redistributive agenda. In other words, how can events be relevant  
to everyone on an equal basis? Diversity refers to how individuals, communities, and often  
self-defined segments of the population \(e.g., by gender, age, ethnicity, etc.\) are represented in  
positions of power and engaged in event planning.  
The book Marginalisation and Events \(Walters and Jepson, 2019\) considered what it means to be  
marginalised, starting with the notion that actually calling people marginal is a reflection of bias  
on the part of those in power. The book examined a number of categories, including those who  
experienced exclusion or disenfranchisement on the basis of demography \(e.g., age, marriage  
status\), religion, gender or sexuality, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status \(e.g., income,  
employment\) disability, refugee or migrant status, or geographic location.  
The Routledge Critical Event Studies Research Series started with the book Gendered Violence at Inter-  
national Festivals \(Platt and Finkel, 2020\) wherein the notions of liminality and communitas  
are examined as they pertain to power and gender. We return to those issues in the section on  
Gender Studies in Chapter 16.  
An important point to emphasise is that all editions of this book have argued for positive  
change, such as advocating adoption of sustainability principles, viewing events as agents of Introduction and Overview of Event Studies change, exposing the many problems and limitations of event-impact methods, and condemn-  
ing many false or unproven claims about benefits, while costs are too often ignored or down-  
played. In this fifth edition, increased attention is given to sustainability, including advocacy  
of adoption and implementation of the UN’s sustainability goals. A new section on Gender  
Studies has been included, greater attention given to internationalism and cultural issues, and  
a more complete coverage of critical issues facing the planet and how events can play a positive  
role. Overall, the authors have consistently pursued a very challenging goal, to build a complete  
understanding of the planned events sector. Students and researchers should always be critical,  
including making a critical assessment of all claims made by those seeking to advance their  
own economic, political, and philosophical positions.  
13  
*Event Studies and Its Influence on Other Disciplines and Fields*  
As Event Studies matures, its influence has grown in other fields and areas of professional  
practice. This can be attributed to several factors. First, with their focus being the delivery  
of experiences, event producers have often led the way in making the experience economy  
real to the general population through a wide range of programming within many event  
types. The same can be said more recently for the digital economy, with the pandemic  
making virtual and hybrid events popular. Events demonstrate how a wide range of public  
policies and corporate strategies are being implemented, and highlight both positive and  
negative impacts. This has attracted a great deal of attention \(not always favourable!\) and  
generated research and publications in very diverse journals – as illustrated throughout  
this book.  
Advances in research methods, theories pertaining to experiences, and practical insights on  
how people interact at live events will continue to stimulate ideas in other fields. This is in  
addition to the longstanding attention several foundation disciplines have given to rituals,  
festivity, and the carnivalesque.  
# A Framework for Understanding and Creating Knowledge  
# about Planned Events  
A three-part core is depicted in Figure 1.3, consisting of\:  
1 The study of all planned events, other live mass assemblies, social events, and to a certain  
extent virtual events.  
2 The experience of events, by attendees and all other stakeholders.  
3 Meanings attached to events and to event experiences.  
*The Core Phenomenon*  
A field of study requires a distinct core phenomenon. Phenomenon means a state or process known  
through the senses, in other words, something that can be experienced. We are studying a  
universal phenomenon that has importance around the world, in every culture and society.  
Incidentally, the alternative, more popular definition of phenomenon, is that of a remarkable occur-  
rence, which can be a synonym for a special event!  
This definition of the core of Event Studies broadens the field considerably and imposes a sub-  
stantial theoretical and philosophical component. What do all planned events have in common  
that justifies their own field of study? They have the following characteristics\: 14  
Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
l Timelessness\: events are inherent in all societies and integral to civilisation.  
l Global importance in terms of public policy, industry, and corporate strategy.  
l Recent and rapidly expanding professional practice of event management and also event tourism  
and event policy careers; business opportunities abound.  
l Recognition that events are fundamental to the experience economy, indeed are essential to the  
evolving nature of leisure and culture.  
l A high level of student demand, leading to a proliferation of event management programmes  
globally, many with specialisations, which in turn fosters further academic research and  
publication to advance knowledge in the field.  
The essence of the planned event is that it has purpose, goals, and design. It will be managed  
and marketed. The design, including setting and management systems, cannot guarantee spe-  
cific experiences and cannot cover all the possible experiences and meanings attached to the  
event, but it does facilitate some experiences and exclude others. Its intended meaning will be  
communicated to targeted audiences.  
There are many styles of planned events, produced for many purposes, but in every case, there  
is intent to create, or at least shape, the individual and collective experiences of the audi-  
ence or participants. New forms are always being created, and this is of considerable interest.  
Multiple perspectives on experiences and meaning have to be included in the planning and  
design of events. There are paying customers or invited guests at planned events, but we also  
need to recognise and study the experiences of organisers, staff, sponsors and other facilita-  
tors \(i.e., those providing resources and support\), regulators \(e.g., city officials\), co-producers  
\(i.e., those external stakeholders who share in event production\), participants \(e.g., artists and  
athletes\), exhibitors, and suppliers. A further dimension is the pivotal role of volunteers, as  
numerous events cannot exist without them. Consequently, this raises a number of fundamen-  
tal questions about the experience and meaning of events\:  
l What motivates all these stakeholders, and what different experiences do they have?  
l How do all these stakeholders react to the designed experience, or at least to the setting and  
programme of events?  
To address these questions, we need to examine a number of key concepts around the experi-  
ence and meaning of events associated with the study of semiotics.  
Semiotics and the meaning of ‘meanings’  
Do all events and event experiences have hidden or profound meanings? Not necessar-  
ily, because an experience can be purely hedonistic, which means it gives pleasure without  
significance or symbolic meaning. In fact, many people would describe such experiences as  
“fun” or diversions. However, many events are significant in social, cultural, economic, and  
environmental terms because they generate benefits that are valued, or generate negative and  
unwanted impacts. Event experiences may also have symbolic meaning for participants, host  
communities, and entire nations.  
Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, and therefore of how meaning is conveyed and  
interpreted. The symbols can be language, icons \(e.g., symbols like a logo or brand\), or objects,  
including people. Meaning can also be conveyed through actions, and institutions also hold  
meanings. The very idea of leisure holds meanings for individuals and groups that are in part  
socially and culturally determined \(Page and Connell, 2010\). To some, leisure has negative Introduction and Overview of Event Studies connotations and is to be avoided, and to others, it is their reason for being. Therefore, under-  
standing events as part of societal attitudes towards leisure and entertainment, fun and hedo-  
nism, is only a partial understanding. Wider studies of the social psychology of events as a  
leisure experience or business phenomenon are required in order to fully appreciate the indi-  
vidualised nature of meaning and what events convey to individuals and groups.  
Symbolic meaning refers to mediated experiences where an object, sign, word, or action means  
something else, or conveys ideas and feelings beyond itself \(Levy, 1959\). For example, the  
event is not merely interpreted as entertainment, but it is understood by some or all of the  
audience that it may be an expression of nationalism, or community identity. Mediation occurs  
in a number of ways, through direct social exchanges \(i.e., interaction at live events\), the media  
\(including the roles of influencers, propaganda, and misinformation\), and marketing.  
To help simplify and create recognisable signs and symbols, marketing as a profession uses the  
concept of branding, which is about communicating with intended customers using a name,  
logo, symbol, or word to simplify and create awareness, or to attract an audience and a per-  
ception of quality or value in the intended experience or event. Therefore, in an event setting,  
how symbols are used will affect how they are perceived and interpreted. Sometimes organisers  
will be completely unaware of the symbolic meanings attached to their events and actions. But  
some events deliberately seek to convey meaning, which is the essence of theming. Cities and  
destinations use events to convey positive images and meanings, so the event itself becomes a  
symbol, and branding is applied to create the value or quality message. This is the essence of  
hallmark events. Sponsors at events believe that the goodwill generated by the event will attach  
itself to their brands, and the brand itself is a symbol of quality or value. To illustrate these  
principles, a study by Wooten and Norman \(2008a\) reported that visitors to a coastal shrimp  
festival placed more importance on the coastal location \(the event setting\) than the shrimp  
\(the theme\) when explaining their satisfaction. People attending or participating in an event  
can attach their own meanings to the experiences.  
Event Studies is concerned about how meanings are attached to planned events by individuals,  
groups, and society. For example, is the event perceived to be a shared cultural experience, or  
personally self-fulfilling – even transformative? Each stakeholder in the process wants, expects,  
and receives potentially different experiences and attaches potentially different meanings to  
the event. One major point to remember is that every event experience will be unique to the  
individual because experiences are internal psychological states.  
15  
*Antecedents, Motivations, and Decision-Making*  
Antecedents include all those factors shaping individual and collective needs or demands for  
events, and how choices and decisions are made. Theory from a variety of disciplines is useful,  
particularly from psychology, and in turn that theory has been adopted by consumer-behaviour  
researchers \(Hall and Page, 2014; Page and Connell, 2010\). In Chapter 12, a framework is  
provided for organising the discussion, starting with the personal dimension. That chapter also  
covers marketing and communications.  
*Planning, Design, Management, and Marketing*  
Planned events happen by conscious human design, created by organisations with many stake-  
holders, and with specific goals. This is the event management domain, focusing as it does  
on mobilising resources, transforming processes, management systems, and professionalism. 16  
Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
Yet as events are means towards an end \(e.g., profit, celebration, branding, political benefits, and  
place marketing\), we always must carefully assess goals and take a multi-stakeholder approach,  
meaning we need to be cognisant of the wider range of objectives and needs associated with a  
specific event. Chapter 10 covers planning \(and operations\), both for and within events, and  
Chapter 11 covers design. This also leads us into the realm of event tourism \(­ Chapter 15\)  
wherein events have specific roles to play in attracting tourists, fostering a positive destination  
image, and acting as animators and catalysts within a specific location, region, or country.  
*Outcomes\: Evaluation and Impact Assessment*  
By outcome we mean the impacts events have on people, the environment, the economy, and  
society. Later we discuss systems theory and the differences between outputs and outcomes,  
but in either case, they must be subject to evaluation and impact assessment. In Chapter 14, the  
subjects and objects of evaluation and impact assessment are fully examined, with the objects  
being social, cultural, ecological, economic, and built-environment outcomes, and the subjects  
being the people, organisations, or things that are affected by events and event tourism. Theory  
and methods of evaluation and impact assessment are summarised, with important conclu-  
sions drawn for practitioners and stakeholders concerning the pitfalls and limitations.  
*Patterns and Processes*  
The theme patterns and processes represent the broader environmental influences and the  
dynamic aspects of our Event Studies system, namely, temporal processes; geographical \(spa-  
tial\) patterns; policy; and creating knowledge. Chapter 16 looks at the three disciplines of  
history, human geography, and future studies. Together they help us answer questions like,  
“Where do events come from, and how do they evolve over time? How are they distributed  
in time and space, and why? What cultural and political, technological and economic forces  
shape events?”  
Policy is a theme running throughout the book, with specific consideration in Chapter 7,  
wherein planning and policymaking are linked. Policy is a force that reacts to and shapes the  
planned event system. Creating knowledge about events is the remaining theme of impor-  
tance. It is discussed in Chapter 17, which also provides a research agenda for advancing Event  
Studies.  
*A Theory of Planned Events?*  
It is unlikely that a single, grand theory can be advanced to cover all important aspects of planned  
events, but a set of interrelated theories that deal with the key elements is within reach. These  
constructs, assembled in an interdisciplinary fashion from available theories adapted to events,  
provide substantial explanatory power regarding all the important elements of the framework.  
This is how many areas of leisure and tourism studies have developed through time, and Event  
Studies seem to be following a similar pathway to harnessing interdisciplinarity. We need an  
integrative theory that accomplishes the following\:  
l Explains the roles and importance of planned events in human society and culture \(this cov-  
ers antecedents and meanings, spatial and temporal patterns\), addressing a key challenge of  
how event spaces are transformed through a temporary activity that redefines how people  
view and enjoy everyday spaces. Introduction and Overview of Event Studies l Provides deep insight into the evolution of events, including indications of how various  
forms of events and their functions are developing \(this covers policy, strategy, and environ-  
mental forces\).  
l Explains how event experiences are influenced, and how meanings – at the levels of per-  
sonal, group, and society – are attached to event experiences \(this covers the core phenom-  
enon and also planning, management and design, antecedents, and consequences\).  
l Suggests ways in which the outcomes of planned events can be predicted and controlled,  
as in the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships \(this covers planning, policy, and  
outcomes\).

Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
During my nearly 50 years in the classroom, I discovered that the best learning out-  
comes for both students and their teachers are those that have been overlooked  
because some believed they were immeasurable. We now live in a world where we  
appear through algorithms to measure almost everything from our behaviour to our  
geographical movements to our geopolitical beliefs and much more. However, how  
often do we measure how well we are able to move from separation to reconciliation?  
From raw emotional disagreement to a reasonable agreement?  
I was once asked what is the best possible outcome from a planned event. When  
­ Professor Getz and I began to evaluate event outcomes in the 1990s, event managers  
and their stakeholders focused upon measuring the impacts of sponsorship and the  
greater economic impact within local communities from event tourism. Therefore, when  
I was asked about the greatest impact of a planned event, I answered that I believed it  
was for the stakeholders who had conceived, planned, and delivered the event’s dream  
to have become stronger as a team through their increased mutual respect for one  
another.  
Too often, economic, social, cultural, and more recently environmental success is  
achieved; however, event teams fail to achieve internal political success and as the  
group becomes more contentious you may find that achieving consensus and a com-  
mon commitment to the same goals, objectives, and strategies is more difficult than  
any time in recent history. This is why I believe that the political outcome of a planned  
event is the most important.  
If the team planning the event could establish as their first goal to embrace with every  
decision the Ubuntu philosophy of the late Nelson Mandela, I am confident that all  
events would have superior outcomes. Ubuntu is derived from the word Munto which  
means a person – a human being. The Ubuntu philosophy requires that every member  
of the event team values the dignity, safety, and welfare of the individual over all other  
considerations. It is a holistic perspective that requires that your event team outcomes  
are managed for the good of all and not just for the few.  
Therefore, the next time you assemble your event team, ask them how they may work  
together to evaluate their success through embracing the Ubuntu. Only through this  
commitment to dignity, safety, and welfare and effective post hoc evaluation, will you  
be able to move from difficult dissension to resilient reconciliation and achieve the sus-  
tainable outcomes that your event stakeholders must produce in order for all society to  
deliver the event dream for the good of all.  
*Event Management and Event Studies Interrelationships*  
Against this background of the growth of event education and research, the philosophy embod-  
ied in this book is unambiguous\: teaching event management requires a blend of management  
fundamentals and the academic study of planned events. In this approach, specialisations are  
taught after the fundamentals have been acquired, although we realise there will probably be  
continuing demand by students and professional bodies for a quick introduction to specialised  
career paths. Another argument presented here is that event management is generic, and the  
knowledge can be applied to all types of events. Introduction and Overview of Event Studies Traditionally, the specialisations within events education have been aligned with professional  
bodies, including those devoted to meetings and conventions, exhibitions, fairs, festivals, and  
sports \(see Table 9.3\). We argue that this is now very antiquated thinking, and it will not sur-  
vive the trend to combine forms and functions, nor the rapid growth in event-related career  
paths that now include policy and analysis positions, private enterprise, new forms of live and  
virtual events, and the amazing possibilities opened up by global communications and social  
media for the co-creation of experiences. In the experience economy, increasingly diverse mar-  
ket segments \(i.e., social worlds or communities of interest\) are generating their own events  
and event travel careers. Specialisation also occurs by the type of employer, namely, venues and  
corporations, government departments, and non-profit associations, all of which have unique  
perspectives on the roles of events. With generic event management as the foundation, all  
these possible specialisations and many more are available.  
In Chapter 9, major career paths in event management are illustrated, with sample job titles and  
pertinent professional associations. Many countries have their own national-level associations,  
and there are many certifications offered by educational institutions as well. In ­ Chapter 15,  
career paths more related to event tourism are similarly profiled.

PROFILE 1.1  
TransRockies Inc. and Gravel Royale  
As a private company producing and managing events, TransRockies Inc., based in  
Calgary, Canada, runs events in both the United States and Canada. They specialise in  
challenging cycling and running events, for which they have a considerable amount of  
experience and a strong reputation. Like many companies and events, they were hard  
hit by the pandemic, with all events being cancelled, followed by a lengthy period of  
uncertainty regarding when they could resume and under what conditions. During this  
two-year period, the company, under the leadership of Ceo Aaron McConnell, designed  
and eventually implemented a new event called Gravel Royale \(https\://www.transrockies-  
gravelroyale.com\). The sport has been described as follows \(source\: racing.trekbites.com\)\:  
*Road races take place almost exclusively on pavement, while gravel races almost*  
*exclusively do not. But from this easy physical distinction, unique personality traits*  
*emerge. Road racing is old, storied, rigid, precise. Gravel racing is young, burgeon-*  
*ing, lax, loose. While the former builds singular legends out of marginal gains, the*  
*latter builds community out of collective experience.*  
The inaugural Gravel Royale was scheduled for August of 2021, but it was cancelled  
on short notice due to re-instated Covid-19 restrictions. The first running was therefore  
rescheduled for August 2022. Registration progress during Covid-19 was strong, reach-  
ing a field size of nearly 300 riders. However, as uncertainty remained about Covid and  
travel restrictions, participants were allowed to transfer their registration to 2023. Ulti-  
mately 180 riders rolled up to the start line in 2022 with a number of registrants either  
transferring their entry to 2023 or simply not showing up. For 2023, organisers were fore-  
casting slightly lower numbers than in 2022. TransRockies is currently considering options  
to adjust the format of the event to make it more attractive for future editions \(Plate 1.2\).  
A full case study of TransRockies and how they managed and innovated throughout the  
pandemic is contained in the following book\: McConnell, A., & Getz, D., Chapter 1 in, 20

Students and practitioners can learn a great deal from these sources and can follow  
progress on the company website. For the purposes of discussion and debate, this  
material addresses a number of issues\:  
–  
How private, for-profit events and their organisations differ from public and  
not-for-profit organisations and events, with particular reference to branding,  
funding, stakeholder management, innovation, and leadership. Introduction and Overview of Event Studies 21  
– the nature of running and cycling events, with profiles of attendees; how these  
up-market, challenging events appeal to highly involved, higher-income adults.  
–  
Crisis management and resilience; how the company’s portfolio of owned and  
managed events provides a measure of protection against fluctuations in the  
marketplace and sudden interruptions like the pandemic.  
– the nature of iconic, destination events that bring tourists to rural and remote  
areas.  
– innovation, within a profit-making context, leading to the creation of a new  
event\: its planning, design, and implementation; marketing with the help of key  
sponsors.  
STUDY GUIDE  
In this first chapter, the student should gain understanding of how and why Event Studies is  
defined and justified as a field of academic inquiry. Consideration has been given to why any-  
one should study planned events, including the obvious relationship to event management and  
event tourism professional education, but also the importance of events within many other  
disciplines, fields of enquiry, and policy domains. Readers should reflect on the ways in which  
events and event professionals can contribute in a positive way to the many problems facing  
the world, as well as the potentially negative impacts associated with events and event tourism.  
Study the framework for understanding and creating knowledge about planned events, as this  
has been used for structuring the book. Each of the components is considered in one or more  
chapters. Be comfortable explaining the three major subdivisions of Event Studies and how  
they interrelate\: disciplinary perspectives \(including the classical social and cultural perspective  
rooted in sociology and anthropology\), event management, and event tourism. The last two  
are applied, leading to distinct career paths, whereas the disciplinary perspective is much more  
theoretical and philosophical in nature. All three have policy implications for governments  
concerned with events and their impacts. They are also called discourses, as each has its own  
traditions in the literature in terms of epistemology \(underlying theory and methodology\) and  
ontology \(bodies of knowledge\).  
Start to consider the major challenges and issues facing event management and event tourism,  
as well as the big policy issues for governments at all levels. There are many specific points  
made throughout the book. Be able to answer, in full sentences and paragraphs, the study  
questions – all are potential exam questions based on this chapter. Fuller answers will be pos-  
sible after finishing the book.  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Why are events important in the context of global problems and issues?  
l What are the roles of planned events, and the priorities, in solving major problems?  
l Define Event Studies as an academic field and explain why it has emerged as an important  
subject matter related to professional praxis.  
l How do events reflect, and fit into both the experience and digital economies?  
l Why are you interested in an events-related education or career? Consider how the field has  
evolved and the wide range of opportunities it presents. 22  
Introduction and Overview of Event Studies  
l Define a community of practice and explain what it personally means to you.  
l Explain the purposes and value of Critical Event Studies, with examples of the kinds of prob-  
lems and issues critical theorists explore.  
l What is the core phenomenon of Event Studies, and whose experiences are we  
interested in?  
l How are meanings given to events and event experiences? What meanings do you attach to  
your personal event experiences?  
l Explain each component of the framework for understanding and creating knowledge about

# Issues Affecting Events  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES  
Upon completion of this chapter, students should know the following\:  
l The underlying forces propelling and constraining growth and trends in the events sector\:  
l population and demographics; politics and law; economy; environment; society and culture;  
and technology.  
l How the global pandemic impacted the events sector, and resulting possible structural  
changes.  
l Major trends in the events sector, linked to underlying forces.  
l Important issues facing the events sector, including those related to continued growth.  
# Introduction  
What explains the rapid growth and expansion of planned events in the modern world? From  
World War Two onwards, forces that have propelled the growth of the events sector, along with  
leisure and travel in general, have been predominant. The pandemic of 2020–2022 was very dis-  
ruptive, causing a temporary retreat, and focused attention on a greater need for sustainability,  
resilience, and a new normal for managers. It remains to be seen if structural changes result,  
such as education and employment patterns, shifts in preferences and economic demand, or  
levels of support from the public and private sectors. Researchers are looking for answers, and  
practitioners are adapting to changing conditions.

Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
Until the pandemic hit in 2020, it was logical to expect growth to continue, but that assump-  
tion can no longer be supported. There might very well be limits to growth globally, or in  
particular countries and cities, owing to established and new constraining factors. This raises  
the question of capacity to absorb events and tourism and is related to the growing concerns  
surrounding over-tourism.  
# Propelling and Constraining Forces  
If we understand the underlying forces, document the trends, and discuss the issues that arise,  
then we will be better able to plan for the future. Our starting point is a detailed examination of  
the propelling and constraining forces, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The forces shaping observ-  
able trends, such as the long-term growth of the events sector, can either be propelling or con-  
straining, and sometimes both! Population growth, for example, leads to increasing demand for  
services of all kinds, including events, but if it is accompanied by poverty or social dysfunction  
then it can have a negative impact by increasing inequalities or tearing communities apart. The  
structure of populations is also critical, leading to our examination of demographics. Digging  
even deeper, there are underlying factors shaping population and demographics, such as cul-  
tural norms, economic conditions, and laws.  
The following major forces are considered\: population, including demographics; politics and  
law, the economy, environment, society and culture \(including values\), and technology. Power-  
ful forces are usually interrelated, and they are often compounding – meaning they interact and  
make things worse or better. Take, for example, the combination of a large, young population,  
increased disposal incomes, access to the Metaverse, and – in some countries, not all – the  
result is substantial growth in demand for live music concerts. And there is always tension  
between those forces propelling growth and those constraining it, as in the case of technology  
both enabling event-consumer choices while simultaneously enabling virtual events as a poten-  
tial alternative.

*Population and Demographics*  
The world’s population was projected to reach eight billion persons by the end of 2022, grow-  
ing to almost nine billion by the year 2050. However, the rate of population growth has slowed  
because of notable declines in birth rates, especially in the more economically developed coun-  
tries \(source\: United Nations – https\://population.un.org/dataportal/home\).  
Population growth is not uniform, with Africa and Asia accounting for the highest increases,  
and numerous countries – particularly Japan and Europe – projected to decline owing to age-  
ing. Some countries, like Canada and the USA, rely on substantial immigration to sustain their  
population and ensure they have an adequate supply of workers because their home-born pop-  
ulation is rapidly ageing. In 2023, India overtook China as the world’s most populous country,  
while China has begun a slow decline. A great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the impact  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on migration, fertility, poverty, and global food supply and  
costs, so trends are subject to unpredictable externalities. See Table 2.1 for details.  
Continued global population growth has given rise to pressure on all the planet’s resources,  
especially when combined with other factors such as disease, war, and climate change, which  
in turn lead to mass migration. Large-scale migration, or diaspora, and the resulting changes  
in social life and culture, directly affect the events sector. Many once-homogeneous societies  
are now multicultural, and the mix is changing. This often imposes serious strains on the  
fabric of society, but also potentially enriches life. Forced migration, caused by war, poverty,  
or natural disasters, imposes great stress on both the migrants and their hosts – often unwill-  
ing hosts, as evidenced by the efforts made to keep migrants and refugees out of certain  
countries.

Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
Most of the world’s population, especially migrants, live in cities that are getting larger and  
more complex. Half or more of the migrants are women, many are children on their own, and  
most migrants are in their childbearing years. These facts pose an enormous strain on both the  
migrants and the hosts, and the growth of high-density mega cities adds to the tensions and  
stresses. Cities can be hotbeds of innovation through the creative mixes of people, as well as  
sinkholes of poverty, corruption, and violence.  
Urban life is a source of many stressors on the environment and on human health. In many  
places, rural areas continue to depopulate, while in others the divisions between rural and  
urban life have blurred because of lifestyle migrants, tourism, and second homes. Events that  
bring people together and provide identity for persons, groups, and places have taken on much  
greater significance.  
Ageing and intergenerational challenges  
Intergenerational differences, and the process of changing values and preferences over time,  
have not been studied sufficiently in the context of events. Particularly relevant is the con-  
tribution to the quality of life \(Jepson and Stadler, 2017\), and the new methodologies being  
developed to understand emotion, memory creation, and the resulting psycho-social effects of  
event attendance \(Stadler, Jepson and Wood, 2018; Wood and Kenyon, 2018\). We have to bor-  
row extensively from psychology, leisure, and tourism to provide these insights, but there is no  
doubt that younger generations are going to have to deal with many more serious challenges,  
compared with the post-war baby boomers, as well as having many different opportunities  
provided by technology and networking.  
Changes related to ageing have been described as the Third Age by Laslett \(1989\) in terms of a  
new stage of later life where one derives personal fulfilment from the activities one pursues.  
Blaikie \(1999\) expanded the concept of the Third Age, seeing it as a period of independent  
living in later life preceding a life of dependency. One of the key challenges and opportunities  
for people in the third age is embracing new technology and its rapid adoption, which is now  
influencing habits and preferences in social life, work, and leisure. Another generational issue  
of importance is the continuing decline in exercise and outdoor activity and the resulting con-  
tribution towards unhealthy lifestyles, with predictions of obesity epidemics in many devel-  
oped countries \(Bleich et al., 2008\).  
For all world regions, the potential support ratio is expected to decline. This means that while  
the population continues to age, the proportion of working-age persons \(i.e., 25–64\) is also  
shrinking, owing to declining birth rates. This presents the economy of many countries with a  
serious financial challenge and has led many governments to encourage more immigration. The  
proportion of women in the workforce has risen in many countries, and this fact correlates with  
both higher levels of education and declining rates of marriage and childbirth. While health and  
average life expectancy has risen around the planet, the pandemic served to remind everyone of  
vulnerabilities in the prevention and treatment of diseases.  
*Politics and Law*  
There are ongoing factors such as conflicts, terrorism, disease, or civic unrest that impact  
events and tourism, affecting the perception and stability of environments in which to host  
events. It is easy to cancel conventions, competitions, and festivals, and governments seeking  
to restore order or prevent unrest will often see public gatherings as a threat. But whatever the Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events 27

source of disruption, be it political or a new global pandemic, the effects are usually region-  
alised. Long-term trends show that global tourism growth has always rebounded. Table 2.2  
provides the summary.  
Always relevant are the many policies and regulations enacted by governments affecting  
travel, culture, leisure, and events, and these vary from country to country. Pro-travel policies  
have given a major boost to leisure, consumerism, tourism, and event development. On the  
other hand, pressure to deal with climate change results in carbon taxes and, potentially, other  
measures that could increasingly act to slow growth or impose specific barriers to travel and  
events.  
Increasing regulation and professionalism in the events sector also means that advanced edu-  
cation is becoming more and more essential, and inevitably professionals and companies will  
have to be licensed in order for events to get approvals and insurance. The education, lifelong  
learning, and ever-more detailed training of event professionals is necessary both for health  
and safety reasons and to ensure that companies and governments realise their goals. 28  
Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
Pandemic-related regulations  
Governments were forced to act to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 and its variants, result-  
ing in a host of laws and regulations that directly impacted the events sector. It remains to be  
seen if permanent structural changes will result. These are the main areas of government action  
related to the pandemic\:  
l Ownership and control of venues, including public open spaces, enabled closures that pre-  
cluded events.  
l Declaration of a health emergency, thereby granting exceptional powers such as the obliga-  
tory wearing of masks and social distancing; outright banning of mass gatherings \(or limit-  
ing attendance\); requiring inoculations in order to participate; and information and services  
made available at events.  
l Financial response\: increases or decreases in funding to venues and events; targeted funding  
\(e.g., to subsidise payrolls and keep jobs\); post-cancellation funding to bring events back in  
order to market cities and destinations.  
l Planning for recovery \(e.g., announcing scheduled re-opening of venues and events; creating  
new events; collaboration to produce pandemic-response guidelines\).  
Human rights  
In many countries, human-rights violations remain a serious concern, and in almost every country  
there remain issues to resolve, with identifiable roles for the event sector to make a positive contri-  
bution. Table 2.3 summarises these, drawing on current news reports and the work of the United  
Nations \(https\://humansrightsworld.com/human-rights/current-human-rights-issues/\).

*Economics*  
We know that economic recessions affect demand for many events, and while this is a periodic  
constraining phenomenon, it has not slowed the long-term growth in travel or planned events.  
Globalisation is a major propelling factor. Despite being defined in many ways, globalisation  
is in general a collection of forces resulting in greater integration of economies and cultures.  
Global communications, transportation advances, capital flows, migration, and freer trade are  
major contributing factors. The world is shrinking in real and perceived terms as people and  
their lives seem to draw closer. This has been described as time–space compression \(Warf,  
2008\), as transport and communications have made the world a much easier place in which to  
communicate and travel. We are all interconnected, and global events, even the broadcasts, and  
webcasts of minor events, reinforce these perceptions \(see Table 2.4\).  
Globalisation has many potential consequences for planned events. Communications make  
it possible to reach out to everyone, and instant communications encourage people to meet  
virtually and in person. The democratisation of tourism makes it possible for increasingly large  
numbers of people to attend festivals and events. But there is a concomitant tendency for  
standardisation \(e.g., global parties produced for tourism\) and an emphasis on spectacle, both of  
which threaten local control and authenticity. The mass movement of people, both migration  
and business tourism, encourages the spread of ideas. Diaspora leads to a desire to retain or  
reinvent root cultures through festivals and events.

by others. Invariably, anti-globalisation protestors show up at international political meetings,  
concerned about the tendency for wealth to concentrate in rich countries and the obvious  
failure of international efforts to eliminate poverty. The term glocalisation has been coined to  
describe a process in which the local culture is preserved within global systems, giving rise to  
the deliberate creation of events as preservers of traditions.

*Environment*  
The response to environmental disasters is usually short-lived compared to the permanent  
problems generated by climate change. Food security is also a resulting problem with huge  
implications for the world. Nations have been slow to implement carbon reduction plans, and  
the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the fact that the world is still greatly dependent on  
fossil fuels and the export of grains \(see Table 2.5\).

*Society and Culture*  
Values are constantly shifting, and this is reflected in consumer patterns and political upheav-  
als. Some of this is predictable, based on changing demographics \(e.g., what does generation  
‘next’ want?\), and migration creating more pluralistic nations. Ideally, these shifts will result in  
an integrated, healthier, and creative society. But we can also expect major public and political  
reactions to racial and religious mixing, to economic downturns, to food or water shortages,  
and to environmental problems. How these forces will translate into political and economic  
action is more difficult to predict, and can be specific to countries and cities. One global chal-  
lenge to peace and prosperity is increasing forced migration \(i.e., refugees from conflict, pov-  
erty, environmental catastrophes, or disease\) and the widening gap between rich and poor  
countries \(and also between the wealthy class and all others, even within developed nations\).  
These forces will influence many aspects of politics, society, and economics. See Table 2.6.  
*Technology*  
Technological changes are at the forefront of thinking about the future \(see Table 2.7, and the  
Expert Opinion by Matt Frew\). Some particularly relevant forecasts relate to the impact technol-  
ogy is having on jobs, with many entire categories set to disappear owing to artificial intelligence  
\(AI\) and be replaced by others that are either nascent or not yet invented. The age of specialisa-  
tion is leading to many more careers in which mastery of information technology is a prerequisite.  
Advances in technology also bring new opportunities for cultural exchanges and development.  
Technological advances, for example, in terms of health, safety, food and water supplies, and  
carbon storage, offer significant opportunities for planned events. Wearable technology, as one  
example, is making physiological monitoring of audience biometrics a practical form of con-  
sumer feedback and a means to monitor audience health and safety.  
The Expert Opinion by Matt Frew is, to say the least, provocative, mixing as it does a dose of  
futurism with a summary of technological developments and an unfiltered look into the world  
of DARQ. Readers are advised to read it slowly, in order to absorb the many implications.

EXPERT OPINION 2.1\: By Dr. Matt Frew  
Future Events\: Darq Dreamscapes and the Synthetic Self  
Dr. Matt Frew, Ph.D., is a Senior Lecturer in Enterprise and Transformational Technol-  
ogy, School of Business and Creative Industries, University of West of Scotland.  
Over the last few years, the events industry has undergone a seismic change. Of course  
many will point to the global Covid-19 pandemic, how it decimated live events and com-  
pelled the events industries to embrace technological innovation and pivot to cloud-  
based events and digitised experiences. However, the pandemic merely accentuates and  
accelerates the symbiotic relationship events have long had with technological innova-  
tion. This is evident from the Great Exhibition of 1851 \(Hall, 2006\), Nazi tv propaganda  
of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the multi-mediated and socially networked 2014 World  
Cup \(Watt, 2014\), to today’s hyper-digitised mega-events \(Lee Ludvigsen and Petersen-Wagner,  
2022\). More importantly, in placing events under a global gaze, the pandemic  
reveals how events, and every other industry, find themselves challenged and changed  
by this age of acceleration \(Freidman, 2016\). Today, the speed, scale, and scope of trans-  
formational technologies reflect a transhuman discourse that is radically revolutionising,  
not only events, but also the structuring relations of life, society, and the self. 34  
Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
From a Future Studies perspective, transhumanism critiques the integration of science  
and technology to enhance the human condition and so move beyond its physical,  
biological, and intellectual limits \(Kreowski, 2017\). We are living in unprecedented  
­ techno-cultural times \(Dijck, 2013\). Technology is not only a marker of the development  
of events it informs and shapes what it means to be human. Glance across the ubiquity,  
immediacy, and mobility of technological touchpoints and the claim that “to be human  
is to be transhuman” \(Silva, 2014\) is, increasingly, difficult to deny.  
Consider for a moment the *last century* and the impact of innovations such as the tele-  
graph, silent then talking pictures, radio, and the masses mesmerised by the magic box of  
early tv through to the birth of personal computing and the Internet. Now, consider the  
*past decade* and think of the technological transitions we have witnessed. The explosion  
of the web, democratisation of digital, mobility and sophistication of smart technologies,  
and omnipresent social media are driven by global user-generated content, all of which are  
lifestyle givens. However, we also see an array of technologies moving from the margins  
to the mainstream. For example, a maturing Internet of Things \(IoT\), robotics, holograph-  
ics, haptics, brain-to-computer interface \(BCI\) to wearables of old school Google Glass,  
RayBan Stories, the rumoured augmented reality of Apple Glass to Mojo contact lenses  
where ‘invisible computing’ endows the wearer with ‘everyday superpowers’ \(Stein, 2020\).  
Then there are darQ technologies or distributed ledger systems, ai, virtual, aug-  
mented, mixed to extended reality, and quantum computing. darQ collectively rep-  
resents those transformational technologies that are central to our transition to a fourth  
industrial revolution \(4iR\), which are revolutionising how we work, learn, and live. There-  
fore, and using darQ as an umbrella term for all the above, this age of acceleration and  
4iR is marked by a tsunami of transformational darQ technologies where\:  
From the moment of waking, technologies become engrained, embodied and net-  
worked, binding and bridging our physical life with one that is digital…an E-volution  
if you will, and events find themselves at the forefront of the dynamic and underlying  
politic of this phenomenon.  
\(Frew, 2014, 102\)  
We are clearly well beyond social media cultures of convergence \(Flinn and Frew, 2014\)  
or those ‘Zoom culture’ and hybrid events spawned by the pandemic. Transformational  
darQ technologies represent a paradigm shift moment for the events industries.  
Events showcase our transhuman E-volution where, the integrated power and potential  
of darQ technologies, digitally disrupt desire, break the bonds of physics, frustrations  
with our embodied state and, increasingly, challenge the structuring relations of time,  
space, and subjectivity.  
Most importantly, darQ technologies provide the building blocks for the Metaverse or,  
what I prefer to refer to as current ‘intimations of the Metaverse’ and a future ‘acceler-  
ated Metaverse’. However, while a buzzword of the Silicon Valley technorati, associated  
with Neil Stephenson’s *SnowCrash* \(1992\), linked to Facebook’s rebranding to Meta,  
source of media hype and usual ridicule rollercoaster, the Metaverse is highly contro-  
versial. Moreover, events play a central role in this controversy.  
Events showcase the Metaverse in action, or more, events provide ideal illustrations of  
developing, intimations of the Metaverse. Now, in platforms such as Fortnite, Roblox, Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events 35  
Horizon Venues, Sandbox, and Horizon Worlds we see digitally immersive, 3D, virtual  
reality \(vr\) concerts and events with the likes of John Legend, Snoopdog, Foo Fighters,  
and Justin Bieber \(Speakman, 2021\). In these intimations of the Metaverse, the world  
can access and engage in an immersive experience from the comfort of their living  
room. Artists can draw massive audiences as seen with Travis Scott’s concert, which  
attracted 12 million fans. Others, such as Ariana Grande, are doing full tours while fes-  
tivals like Decentraland’s Metaverse Music Festival are emerging to capitalise on this  
growing trend and desire for “larger and more immersive events in the future” \(bbC,  
2020\). Then you have Abba Voyage where motion-captured avatars of Abba “see the  
lines between digital and reality blurred” \(Smith, 2022\). Here, Abba is recreated as  
younger versions of themselves and, as digital abbatars, plays with a ten-piece band  
to a live audience every night. However, these intimations of the Metaverse events have  
accentuated the frustration and controversy around the concept of the Metaverse and  
the darQ technologies that underpin it.  
First, and well before Stephenson’s Snow Crash, the underpinning features of the  
Metaverse are well rehearsed in Future Studies, futurists, and throughout popular  
science fiction. Second, the association with Meta. Sure Mark Zuckerberg promoted  
a vision, and given his billion-dollar investment in vr Oculus Rift, then Quest and  
vr platforms such as Horizon Worlds are understandable. However, the Metaverse  
is not Meta. Meta merely got there early and staked a claim, which set off the mass  
media roller coaster and so clouded the debate. Third, events themselves tend to  
confuse and conflate the Metaverse with specific technologies such as vr, motion  
capture, Cgi, volumetric video, or holographics. While these technologies are central  
to making these early ‘products’ or intimations of the Metaverse they are only part of  
the ever-developing darQ technologies that will drive and underpin an accelerated  
Metaverse. Finally, all this then fuels the definitional debate of “what actually is the  
Metaverse?”  
A key issue in looking to define the Metaverse is the assumption that it can be defined,  
fixed, or fully finished. Rather than go over convoluted debates \(see Park and Kim \(2022\)  
and Ball \(2022\)\), acknowledging the difficulties with defining the Metaverse and reluc-  
tantly conceptualises it as a “massively scaled and interoperable network of real time  
rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently”.  
Here Ball is pointing to the shift of a 2D web, which we look at, into a future iteration  
of a 3D web, that is live, lives with us in ‘real time’, works across other technologies  
and platforms and so is ever present. Therefore, this future vision of an accelerated  
Metaverse, being dynamic, rhizomatic and so can never be fully realised, points us to  
time when\:  
We will not so much as go into the Metaverse as embody it. It will be woven in and  
through the fabric of our life, surrounding and saturating us…Endlessly evolving  
ecosystems of interconnectivity where our physical, technological and biological be-  
ing and worlds will, increasingly, blur.  
\(Frew, 2022\)  
Most importantly, while events illustrate intimations of the Metaverse, they also high-  
light the trajectory of transformational darQ technologies. Events are the perfect play-  
ground for an accelerated Metaverse where we can realise darQ dreamscapes. 36  
Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
Think for a moment where we are at with current intimations of the Metaverse. How  
these events are off-world spectaculars that are designed to, increasingly, deliver deep  
immersive experiences. The ‘end game’ has always been the search for ‘presence’; that  
feeling of actually being there. This highlights the strategic development and drive of  
darQ technologies, which will take us from current ‘intimations’ into an accelerated  
Metaverse where you will feel “truly present … share unbounded spaces … not just  
moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures” \(Zucker-  
berg, cited in Dredge, 2014\). Interestingly, these are comments and a vision for the  
Metaverse from 2014. Today, with the development and integrated power of darQ  
technologies, events in an accelerated Metaverse take us to extended reality expe-  
riences or Xrevents. In darQ dreamscapes, the Xrevent replicates experience and  
emotion and saturates senses so intensely that a “warm embrace; the view, sounds,  
breeze, and smells of the beach” \(Schybergson, 2014\) become possible.  
More interestingly, in darQ dreamscapes, Xrevents bring our transhuman discourse  
into critical relief. Time, space, and subjectivity are blurred, re-written if not erased.  
Our conception of ‘reality’ is challenged as our material, digital, and biological worlds  
fuse. With Xrevents you can go anywhere, anyplace, anytime; live and relive past  
memories; be young, old, or assume a new self, a new performativity, and be whoever  
you want to be.  
Given what we have already witnessed, darQ dreamscapes and Xrevents point to a  
possible or probable future rather than a preposterous one. Again, while such Xrevents  
may seem anathema to event practitioners who privilege the physical ‘live’ event and  
the notion of the ‘real’, these darQ dreamscapes will not go away. Just think, “if you’re  
feeling bored and want to take an hour-long holiday…visit Carnival in Rio? Stressed? Go  
spend some time on a beach in the Maldives” \(Schmidt and Cohen, 2013, 24\). The ease  
and immediacy to ‘place shift’, and engage in new modes of experience and socialisa-  
tion are highly attractive. Again, think of the depth of learning experience from visiting  
the Pyramids of Giza, ancient Rome, or the Moon landing. Relive, and be upfront, at  
a Beatles gig, Woodstock, Live Aid or adopt a new performative persona and take a  
walk on the festive or sexual wild side. Such darQ dreamscapes filled with Xrevents all  
have a magnetic appeal. Moreover, and unlike the ‘real’ events, tourism and sport, with  
darQ dreamscapes issues of gentrification, capacity, inclusivity, physical disability, and  
age not to mention climate change, mass carbon footprints, and sustainability are over-  
come, eliminated or reduced \(Kaku, 2012; Novaes, 2020\). Most importantly, in darQ  
dreamscapes, new modes of social interaction, engagement, and experience bring new  
modes of commerce and consumption. Nevertheless, this does not mean that an accel-  
erating Metaverse and the darQ dreamscapes are unproblematic.  
Technology has never been neutral for, while we shape technology, technology always  
shapes us \(Dijck, 2013; Frew, 2014\). Many have raised concerns about escapism,  
exploitation, and the possible dystopian nightmare that this accelerating techno-­ culture  
may produce \(Gumbel, 2014\). After all, if darQ dreamscapes and Xrevents promise  
unbridled freedom, experience, and even the ability to recreate self, relive, and reboot  
life itself, why would we ever leave? Moreover, when you do leave, are you faced with  
a ‘reality’, life and self that is fundamentally disappointing, being ever reminded of that  
new, younger, adventurous performative self of the dreamscape? Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events 37  
Undoubtedly, many will shake their heads and dismiss such notions as folly. Again,  
appeals will be made for the old discourse of the material ‘live’ events where we can  
get a truly human event experience. Others will go further claiming, or hoping, the  
‘Metaverse is dead’ \(Naughton, 2023\) and how darQ dreamscapes and Xrevents will  
never replace, or be as authentic as, lived, embodied reality. This debate, if not dying,  
deflects and distracts from the fact that darQ dreamscapes already exist and the trans-  
formational darQ technologies upon which they are built will not stop. Sure the term  
‘Metaverse’ may be supplanted but the E-volution of the transhuman discourse, drive,  
and demand for darQ dreamscapes will continue to accelerate. This is illustrated by  
abba Voyage Producer Svana Gisla who, when asked at a recent DCms committee  
about future developments for events and the abbatars, responded\:  
With technology becoming faster Benny and Bjorn could be sitting in a chair like  
this one, connected to their avatars, talking about last night’s football results to the  
audience…That will come!’  
\(Gisla, 2022\)  
In highlighting how the real Benny and Bjorn can inhabit and interact through their  
abbatar, Gisla raises the controversial stakes of an accelerating Metaverse and darQ  
dreamscapes by pointing to the rise of synthetic humans. Synthetic humans are virtual  
creations that, unlike the cartoon avatars most are familiar with and we see in current  
intimations of the Metaverse, are indistinguishable from the ‘real’ you; they are a ‘syn-  
thetic self’.  
Essentially, the synthetic is a deepfake clone and, most controversially, powered by  
ai, it can emote thousands of responses, learn and so engage and interact for deeper,  
more personal experiences. Moreover, the synthetic self is not science fiction but very  
‘real’ and now. We see them with Ziva Dynamics’ Emma, Soul Machines’ creation of  
Will-i-am or, more interestingly, Jack Nichlaus’ ‘Digital Jack’. With ‘Digital Jack’ we get  
a glimpse of the future. With Digital Jack they have recreated Nichlaus at the height of  
his powers where the ai learns the skills, experience, and knowledge. Even the human,  
emotional traits are synthetically captured as ‘Digital Jack’ is trained to “respond by  
looking a little bit more empathetic. You know, so these are some of the ways in which  
we are, you know, using Jack’s digital brain to bring him to life in, in real time” \(Cross,  
cited in Green, 2022\). Now, by cloning Nicklaus and moving him from “the 2D world of  
the internet to the 3D world of the Metaverse”, they produce a new “customer expe-  
rience…\[where\]...with ‘Digital Jack’ \(Nicklaus\)...millions of people can get to feel like  
they have something of a personal experience”. Even Nicklaus recognises legacy, as  
much as the commercial, of his synthetic self\:  
I think it’s kind of unique. You’d like to go back and show people what you did, when  
you did it and what you might say today. I think it’s something that, from a company  
standpoint, it’d be used for decades.  
\(Nicklaus, J., 2022\)  
Such is the power of underpinning ai that some argue that the proliferation of these  
synthetics are “forcing us towards an important and unsettling realisation\: our historical  
belief that video and audio are reliable records of reality is no longer tenable” \(Ajder  
et al., 2019\). 38  
Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
Nevertheless, an accelerated Metaverse of darQ dreamscapes where you connect  
and engage in Xrevent experiences through your synthetic clone, echoes with emi-  
nent futurists and their tendency to reference movie culture for illustration. Whether  
*Star Trek*, *Total Recall*, *Minority Report*, *The Matrix*, *Transcendence, Ready Player One*  
*to Free Guy*, they all point to darQ dreamscapes and how we are turning “popular  
science fiction concepts into science facts” \(Schmidt and Cohen, 2013, 5\). Moreover,  
it raises a critical counterpoint to those who insist on a universal notion of the ‘real’,  
essentialist, or embodied ‘self’ \(Kaku, 2012; Kurzweil, 2008\). More interestingly, when  
companies such as Ziva Dynamics and Soul Machines can not only create synthetic  
humans but bring others back from the dead through ‘synthetic resurrection’ \(Adjer  
et al., 2019\), we take darQ dreamscapes to a new level of controversy.  
Regardless, darQ dreamscapes, Xrevents, and the synthetic self will play a central  
role in our unfolding transhuman evolution. Just like past technologies these darQ  
technologies “will greatly affect how citizens and states behave” \(Schmidt and Cohen,  
2013, 31\). Therefore, it is understandable that the darQ dreamscapes of Xrevents will  
become cultural battlegrounds where the moral, embodied, and socio-political ten-  
sions of the day, as much as notions of the ‘real’ and the ‘self’, will be fought out. darQ  
dreamscapes, future Xrevents, and the rise of the synthetic self reflect a dissolution  
of the structuring relations of time, space, and subjectivity. To dismiss such ideas as  
‘fantastical’ would, ironically, be correct for the ‘real’ is very much up for grabs and the  
future is, indeed, now \(Plate 2.1\).

# Growth-Related Issues Facing the Events Sector  
The continued growth and expansion of events around the world have been commented upon  
frequently, although it is impossible to quantify on a global scale. Indeed, in most countries,  
there are no statistics on festival/event numbers and growth trends. Post-pandemic recovery  
might very well see the resumption of growth in tourism and events, but that remains an open  
question.  
What is certain is that continuous growth is controversial, as it runs counter to principles of  
sustainability, and this applies to growth in the number, size, and impacts of events individu-  
ally and collectively. It particularly applies to event tourism, where consumption of fossil fuels  
is high, and mass tourism threatens sensitive environments as well as residents’ affordability  
and lifestyles. An examination of these issues is important to the future of the events sector.  
*Size and Costs*  
Escalating costs for many services, goods, workers, and venues mean that events are increas-  
ingly unaffordable for many, raising a serious exclusion issue. The high cost of bidding and host-  
ing international events is an impediment to all but a few cities and countries. Many issues are  
raised by mega-events in particular, not the least of which are the opportunity costs associated Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events with such a vast commitment of resources \(see McGillivray and Turner, 2017\), particularly  
when governments are under pressure to reign in debt and concentrate on essential services.  
Large-scale events, or gigantism, generate and usually depend on mass tourism, thereby exert-  
ing unacceptable pressures on society and the environment in terms of debt legacy, white-elephant  
facilities, and over-tourism. Wilson and Millar \(2023\) provide an example, and advice,  
on ensuring the after-use of legacy facilities, however, there have been far too many instances  
of over-building and subsequent under-use of Olympic and other mega-event constructions.  
41  
*Festivalisation and Commodification*  
So pervasive are festivals and events as instruments of public policy that some authors have  
described the process as festivalisation. There are several connotations, however, that need to be  
explored. According to Richards \(2007\), this term appears to have arrived through translation  
from the writing of two Germans, Häussermann and Siebel \(1993\), who argued that cities  
competing for cultural consumers create or support festivals for different target markets, and  
consequently the cities become festivalised \(in German the term used was Festivalisierung\).  
Richards \(2007, 282\) stated that it refers to the use of flagship festivals and large cultural  
events in place marketing, with implications for urban culture and liveability. Long et al. \(2004,  
8\) referred to festivalisation in urban policy as being an aspect of aesthetics, like streetscaping  
and urban development schemes. Smith \(2014, 2015\) explored the festivalisation of public  
spaces, which can lead to limited use by residents.  
There appears to be a general negativity associated with the term as if it was an undesirable  
process, or at least that it carries risks. In this way, it connects to the terms commodification and  
commoditisation, which are frequently employed in a derogatory sense to describe the process  
of festivals losing their cultural authenticity when exploited for tourism or other commercial  
purposes. This line of criticism specific to festivals seems to have started with ethnographic  
studies by Greenwood \(1972, 1989\). To Richards \(2007\), festivalisation implied commodifica-  
tion and removal of control from local to national and global levels of power.  
*Over-tourism*  
As more fully discussed in Chapter 15, too much of a good thing generates problems, even in  
the world of tourism where most cities and destinations have relentlessly pursued growth. Bar-  
celona, once hailed as the prime model of a city benefitting from a mega event, has since seen  
major protests by residents against too many tourists and resulting high costs, lack of housing  
related to the phenomenon of private rentals, and crowding.  
*Spectacle Versus Engagement*  
The spectacle exists within the realm of the visual as something viewed, but it is larger than life,  
colourful, exciting, and novel, otherwise, we would perceive it to be ordinary and unremark-  
able. We are easily seduced by the spectacle, otherwise, people would get bored with fireworks  
and lasers, parades, shows, and outlandish costumes. It is a substantial part of entertainment  
in general, and event programming in particular. Gotham \(2005a\) examined spectacle in the  
context of urban festivals in New Orleans, using Debord’s \(1983\) theory of the spectacle and  
the writings of Henri Lefebvre \(e.g., The Production of Space, 1991\) to examine conflicting mean-  
ings assigned to the celebrations. Different stakeholders employed festivals to attract tourists,  
empower communities, or sow dissent. Viewed as a spectacle, in the tradition of Debord, a 42  
Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events  
festival is merely one manifestation of everything becoming a commodity as opposed to festi-  
vals or carnivals as participatory experiences. Andrews \(2006\) examined the Disneyization \(or  
Disneyfication\) of the National Basketball League and the creation of a spectacle to revitalise  
the audiences using Debord as a theoretical frame of reference.  
According to the anthropologist MacAloon \(1984\), a festival is a joyous celebration of unity,  
cooperation, accomplishment, and excellence, while a spectacle is a display of imagery evoking  
a diffuse sense of wonderment and awe. In that sense, the so-called WOW reaction to event  
settings and programming are closely related. Regarding the Olympic Games, MacAloon \(1984,  
242\) argued that of all the genres of cultural performance, spectacle, and games appeared  
first, followed by festival and ritual. Spectacles are not only things to be seen but also possess  
symbolic codes. Spectacles must be grand, dramatic, or huge. There is no spectacle without  
actors and audience, or performers and spectators. Spectators must be excited by the spectacle,  
or otherwise emotionally moved. MacAloon argued that festival and spectacle are in opposi-  
tion, but share one feature – they both employ a variety of cultural performances. In this way,  
the Olympics embodies a ritual organised around the classic rites of passage \(i.e., opening  
and closing ceremonies\) which introduce liminality, intensification \(i.e., victory and medal  
awards\), closure, and reaggregation. MacAloon concluded \(1984, 268\) by saying that spectacle  
has destructive effects on rituals, festivals, and games.  
*Live Versus Virtual Events*  
What people usually mean by virtual event is really a form of online and remote communica-  
tions. This includes teleconferences and online streaming of sports or entertainment. There has  
been a fear for many years that people will stay at home or in their offices rather than attend  
meetings, conventions, exhibitions, or any entertainment offering. Sadd \(2014\) argued that  
the transformational power of technology will impact the design of events, and that blended  
technology fusing the virtual and the real is the way forward, but she also maintained that  
gatherings of people still need interaction for the co-creation of experiences. We discuss the  
virtual event experience in Chapter 4 and the design of virtual events in Chapter 11. Recall  
Matt Frew’s assessment of how virtuality and the Metaverse are NOW, not the future.  
*Security, Sustainability, and Resilience*  
Underlying forces continue to generate growth and diversity in the events sector, accompa-  
nied by larger and more dangerous threats. These are constraining forces, or limiting factors,  
that will apply in different places to different degrees. We consider disasters, crises, and secu-  
rity issues in Chapter 13, alongside environmental management, resilience, and health issues.  
Environmental sustainability is a broad concept, and various threads of this discourse run  
throughout this book\: green operations; ecological footprint and carbon emissions; the future  
of event tourism; institutionalisation; economic viability; managerial competence; population  
ecology and portfolio management; and costs and legacies. Bringing them all together to for-  
mulate a clear and integrated measure of sustainability is challenging, so it is probably wise to  
think of sustainable tourism and events as a process of continuous striving for improvement.  
*Energy*  
Not so long ago it was important to talk about peak oil, meaning we would soon run out with  
disastrous consequences. That proved to be as inconsequential as the projected computer-based Forces, Trends, and Issues aFFecting Events disaster associated with the new millennium. What has replaced those concerns is accelerat-  
ing global warming and the urgent need to replace fossil fuels with clean, sustainable energy.  
Growth demands more and more energy, and unless and until we find a global solution, events  
and tourism will be vulnerable to rising costs for all energy, and possible restrictions owing to  
the need to cut harmful emissions.

STUDY GUIDE  
Students, policymakers, and event practitioners should step back from time to time to con-  
sider the underlying forces that are shaping our world and the events sector in particular. This  
chapter provides a guide to the propelling and constraining forces, which can be discussed in  
the context of current policy and planning, or future scenarios. For each of the major forces, be  
prepared to discuss the related trends shaping events, and the issues or challenges we all face.  
Find additional sources and prepare a local or national-level brief on how one or more of the  
forces, trends, or issues are impacting an event or events in general. United Nations material is  
a good starting point \(websites of relevance are provided in the text\). See the UN World Tour-  
ism Organisation for data on trends and how the pandemic affected travel, and check out their  
approach to sustainable tourism \(https\://www.unwto.org/sustainable-development\).

# Introduction  
The world of events is diverse and exciting, with almost unlimited scope for variety in form,  
function, and experiences. Form is what events look like – their tangible shape, setting, pro-  
gramme of activities, and opportunities for experiences, such as the obvious differences  
between an outdoor music festival and an indoor convention or exhibition. The comprehen-  
sive event typology illustrated in Figure 3.1 is largely based on their form. When we associ-  
ate specific forms, settings, and programming with event types like festivals, conventions, or  
sports competitions, we are really creating social constructs that are based on tradition and  
societal expectations. Function refers to their purpose and the roles they play in business or

Figure 3.1 Typology of Planned Events by Form  
public service. Terms like hallmark, mega, or iconic refer to the function of events \(e.g., for image  
making and place marketing\). The meanings we assign to events, and the importance they  
have always held in our personal and collective lives, make them fundamental components of  
culture, business, and lifestyles.  
This chapter commences with a discussion of basic definitions of the terms event and planned  
event, including differences between them, and the question of scale – small versus large events.  
The inherent temporal and spatial dimensions of events are discussed, as this is fundamental  
to understanding much of the related theory.  
# Definitions of Event and Planned Events  
Common dictionary definitions of event stress three characteristics\:  
l An occurrence at a given place and time.  
l A special set of circumstances.  
l A noteworthy occurrence.  
Events, by definition, have a beginning and an end. They are temporal phenomena \(i.e., they  
are time-limited\), and with planned events, the programme or schedule is generally planned  
in detail and publicised in advance. The idea of an endless event is a contradiction in terms but  
could refer to how the content of an event enters the digital metaverse for re-cycling or enjoy-  
ment at any time. Those ideas will be discussed more fully. Planned events are also usually  
confined to particular places, although the space involved might be a specific facility or a very  
large open space. The term meta-event has been used to describe events held in a number of 46  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
locations simultaneously, or at different times but linked by theme. An asynchronous event is one  
that is not restricted by place or time, and therefore probably exists only in the metaverse \(i.e.,  
an integrated, digital world\). When you search for an event on the Internet, you will encounter  
its use in many other fields, for example, in finance where they examine events that disrupt the  
markets or change a business.  
*Uniqueness*  
No matter how hard one tries, it is literally impossible to replicate an event. By definition  
they only occur once, creating a unique experience for the audience or participants. Although  
planned events might be similar in form, some aspects of the setting, people, and programme  
will ensure that the event is always tangibly or experientially different. The expectations,  
moods, and attitudes of guests and participants will always be new, so their experiences will  
differ regardless of the programme and setting. This uniqueness of events makes them attrac-  
tive, even compelling, so cultivating a once-in-a-lifetime image for an event is often the market-  
er’s goal. However, these goals have also become very commonplace in other areas of consumer  
behaviour, as businesses and organisations seek to create unique selling propositions.  
*Planned Events*  
Planned events are live, social events created to achieve specific outcomes, including those related  
to business, the economy, culture, society, and the environment. Event planning involves the  
design and implementation of themes, settings, consumables, services, and programmes that  
suggest, facilitate, or constrain experiences for participants, guests, spectators, and other stake-  
holders. Every event experience is personal and unique, arising from the interactions of the  
setting, programme, and people.  
The names, or labels we place on events, such as festivals, conferences, fairs, or sports are  
really social constructs because when we use these terms most people have an idea of what  
they mean. To the individual, these labelled events look and feel different with regard to their  
purpose, programmes, and meanings. Planned events dominate our thinking, and the content  
of this book, because they are a source of employment and many desired social, cultural, and  
economic benefits.  
*Live Versus Virtual Events*  
The events we focus on in this book are live, social events. They are for people in groups, and  
not merely events in our own, personal lives such as our birthday or the day we discover our  
creative self. A birthday party, however, is a live social event, and so is a gathering of like-  
minded artists to create an installation or temporary art. The degree of planning and organisa-  
tion can be highly variable, with some events being difficult to label.  
People have a need to be together to socialise, celebrate and do business. Online or telecon-  
ferenced events have their place, but they are not in general viewed as replacements for live  
events – they are complementary. During the pandemic, numerous virtual events were created,  
and some will endure, but in most cases, they were not intended to continue when live events  
resumed, except to promote or augment the live social experience. In this book, we talk about  
virtual events in several places, but while they are not the core of Event Studies they are becom-  
ing essential components of event marketing, communications, and fundraising. tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events 47  
*No Such Thing as Events!*  
Having made the case for events as discrete phenomena with temporal and spatial dimensions,  
it is worth noting that in a Buddhist interpretation, everything is interdependent and all events  
arise from previous events. Accordingly, in a more general philosophical context, events might  
not actually exist. This line of argument posits that events cannot be separated completely from  
their context, from the flow of what is happening in the world and in our daily lives. What we  
call a planned event is in reality an integral part of many people’s lives and many stakeholders’  
actions, with various environmental forces acting upon us. Events, therefore, are merely the  
perceived intersection \(in time and/or places\) of different people and the consequences of  
various flows of activity.  
This makes perfect sense philosophically, and certainly, event managers and policymakers must  
be experts at assessing environmental forces and managing stakeholder relationships, but for  
pragmatic reasons, it does not affect our perception that planned events exist, and that Event  
Studies is a vital subject. One need only refer to common language \(i.e., the vernacular\) to  
know that discrete events are central to most people’s understanding of the world and their  
own lives. We measure time and remember events, even if it is arguably an illusion, and there-  
fore we need events to mark important occasions and define periods of activity.  
*Why Study Unplanned Events?*  
Sometimes the differences between planned and unplanned events are invisible or ambiguous.  
The organisers might remain anonymous, they might even be influencers rather than leaders.  
Online communities of interest can self-organise travel and events. Collective action inspired  
and facilitated by social media networking is a growing force in society.  
We also have to consider spontaneous demonstrations, protests, and even riots as events.  
One’s perspective on such occurrences can range from disgust and calls for repression, to exal-  
tation and claims of democracy at work. Another category of unplanned event is illustrated by  
the Halloween disaster in Seoul, Korea in October 2020 \(see Chapter 13\) which can be called a  
predictable mass assembly, being a celebration tied to an important date.  
The experiences and impacts of unplanned events can be identical to the planned events we  
usually study, and they can inform event producers and managers on other important matters  
such as security and crowd behaviour. To critical theorists, and anyone interested in social  
movements, the unplanned event might be more revealing of power relationships, values and  
attitudes, and emerging social-cultural forces \(Table 3.1\).  
*Event-History Analysis*  
This method within social science focuses on socially significant events in the lives of people,  
such as various rites of passage. But in this context, events could also be episodes, such as edu-  
cation and unemployment, jobs, and relationships, as part of one’s life cycle. Rapoport et al.  
\(1975\) in Leisure and the Family, building on the classic studies of family life and leisure of Rown-  
tree and Lavers \(1951\), identified the notion of a family life cycle model and the interrelationship  
between stages in the life cycle, work, and leisure. This has an important bearing on the stages  
in an individual’s and family’s life where events will have specific meaning. Rapoport et al.  
\(1975\) identified four stages\: “Youth, Young Adulthood, Establishment and Later Years”, although we  
also should include childhood in these stages. The period of establishment, which is the largest 48

\(The Realm of Professional  
Event Designers and Managers\)  
PurposeGoals or outcomes are  
specified by producers of the  
event and are influenced by key  
stakeholders.  
Programme Planned and scheduled, usually  
in detail; designers seek to  
create *experiences* for guests,  
participants, and spectators.  
Control Controls are imposed by  
managers and other formal  
stakeholders, including  
governments.  
Accountability Producers and managers are  
formally held accountable.  
Unplanned Events  
\(The Realm of Spontaneity and  
Unpredictability\)  
Purpose is self-defined; the intentions  
of participants might be unclear,  
diverse, or even contradictory.  
Spontaneous activities; or, once set  
in motion by agents, actions become  
rather unpredictable.  
No management systems are in  
place, only a degree of normal  
civic control; sometimes a police  
or emergency-services response is  
required.  
No organisation or legal entity is  
accountable overall; individuals can  
be held accountable for their actions  
\(or inactions\), under the law.  
in the family life cycle, is where the majority of life-history events occur \(marriage, childbirth  
and child-rearing, maintaining friendships, and work careers\). The concept of life stages helps to  
explain how people engage with events and the type of events they will consume in their work  
and leisure time, including the increasing blurring of work and leisure. This has an important  
bearing on the interest in attending events during the establishment stage of the family life  
cycle when people become engaged with others in various communities of interest \(e.g., as  
event volunteers\) or through serious leisure pursuits.  
# Time Is of the Essence  
Time is not a simple concept, and we use expressions of time in many ways – some of which are  
highly relevant to Event Studies. First, time is often conceptualised as being cyclical, as with  
the annual calendar. Seasonal changes are important in terms of climate, food production, and  
the very rhythms of work and social life, and this helps explain the evolution of many rituals  
and festivals. We tend to mark the passage of time with annual holidays and celebrations, and  
we look forward to them coming around next year.  
For time to be available for participation in events, we need to understand the evolution of the  
modern working week and the rise of the weekend as a leisure setting. As Page and Connell  
\(2010\) illustrated, the five-day working week that has dominated industrial society is now  
changing, with more blurring of work and leisure. This is reflected in the reduction in working  
time from six days to five and a half, then to a five-day working week. In some societies, work-  
ing on a Saturday is still a routine activity, but the notion of work time and leisure time has very  
important impacts on when events are scheduled and who will attend. During the pandemic,  
many people started to work from home, raising new expectations regarding work–home bal-  
ance, and leading to less emphasis on in-person work and more on virtual interactions. tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events We also need to look at the biological time and the individual and family life cycle. The maturing  
of one’s body and mind marks the passage of a life, relative to others going through the same  
life-stage changes. These various stages are marked by events we celebrate. Events mark life’s  
changes \(rites de passage, like birthdays and anniversaries\), triumphs \(graduation and other for-  
mal ceremonies\), fun and joy \(festivals, leisure pursuits, and family reunions\), and even tem-  
porary pains \(goodbyes and funerals\). Time and its use in contemporary society therefore have  
a very significant bearing on the nature and study of events.  
49  
*Social and Cultural Constructs of Time*  
As will be seen later, the conceptualisation of the liminal/liminoid zone for the planned event  
experience is a social construct and will vary from culture to culture. In most Western societies  
the meanings and values attached to escapism, free time, leisure pursuits, having a good time  
\(hedonism\), and being entertained, reflect the growth of the public and private consumption  
of leisure time \(Page and Connell 2010\). Grappi and Montanari \(2011\) observed that there was  
a clear link between eventgoers’ emotions, hedonism, and social identity that affected their  
patronage and the time devoted to events. For Wood and Kenyon \(2018\), this was reflected in  
the shared emotional memory of event participants. Events as leisure pursuits can be traced  
back through history. What is new is the way in which our post-modern lives and the global-  
ised nature of leisure consumption have impacted upon the production and enjoyment of so  
many planned events.  
Planned events in the modern world are not only accepted but also expected. The construction  
of time through capitalist society has led to the social and cultural construction of time outside  
of work and the perceived need for annual holidays, numerous special days for commemora-  
tions, and time for ourselves where we attend, or plan our own social events. Historical analysis  
reveals ways by which governments have enacted legislation to create leisure time and to create  
the conditions in which events as experiences can be enjoyed by more people. This process has  
democratised event participation as a mass form of consumption. This is especially the case  
in time–space compression \(see Warf, 2008\), making attending global and mega-events more  
accessible. This reflects the abundance of leisure choices that digitally connected societies now  
take for granted, and where events allow people to be co-present in a specific time and place.  
Time as a commodity  
Time is precious in our society, therefore it has become a commodity with high value. We gladly  
pay for quality time with our friends and families, and this often involves event experiences. We  
will sacrifice money to have more free time. We hate having our time wasted. We all know that  
we cannot buy time, but we can certainly lose time. These values and attitudes are all shaped  
by our culture, and perhaps it would be healthier if our cultural perceptions of time changed.  
How we use, perceive, and value time are important considerations in Event Studies. Events  
are temporal phenomena, with start and end points, yet the event experience is not limited to  
one time and place where an event is held. Clawson and Knetsch \(1966\) conceptualised rec-  
reational travel as a multiphase experience, consisting of the five dimensions of anticipation,  
travel-to, on-site experiences, travel back home, and recollection. Anticipation and recollection  
can be just as important as the experience itself. In this way, the packaging of events, a key  
to effective event tourism development and marketing, should be much more focused on the  
overall experience than on the technical aspects of travel, accommodation, and purchasing  
event tickets. 50  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
The value of time varies a great deal among people, at various stages in their lives, and among  
cultures. Time is money and people want value for their investment of time, but how does this  
apply to planned events? A short, intense event experience can be just what is needed, but  
people are also willing to give up large blocks of time to travel and participate in events. Can  
we measure the value of events by reference to the amount of time people invest in them? The  
answer is yes. It is likely that people value time differently, or at least their access to leisure  
time, and therefore identical event experiences can be much more satisfying to some, even a  
waste of time to others. This illustrates an important role for research in positive psychology  
\(see Filep and Pearce, 2013\) with its focus on how individuals and groups can make their nor-  
mal life more fulfilling through experiences such as events.  
In Faster\: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, Gleick \(2000\) argued that everybody now  
expects that everything can and should be done immediately, giving rise to time pressures in  
our 24-hour society. Cornish \(2004\) contextualised this arguing that the pace of change had  
accelerated to the point that we now live in an age of ‘hyperchange’. Cornish argued that this  
hyperchange combines with the range of super trends which affect society, such as technological  
progress, deculturation, the loss of local culture through globalisation, environmental decline  
and deterioration, increased mobility, and economic progress leading to increased prosperity.  
We need to think of planned events as a respite from this rapidity, a way to escape these time  
pressures and if not to slow down, at least to savour the moment. This is reflected in Falassi’s  
\(1987\) phrase ‘time out of time’ to describe rituals and festivals. The value of time in the event  
setting may therefore be escapism from the routines and rigours of everyday life in much the  
same way that the annual holiday has been evaluated by researchers for many years. This is  
why understanding the social psychology of event participants has such an important role to  
play in revealing how events fit into our complex modern-day lives and the meanings we attach  
to them.  
*A Time and a Place*  
Planned events occupy and temporarily transform spaces \(or venues\), and for the duration of  
the event one’s experience of that place is altered. In turn, many events are intrinsically linked  
to their setting and community. Hence, place and culture combine within a set time frame to  
produce a temporary experience that is bound by place, with patterns and flows of mobility.  
Culture varies geographically, so the influence of place and culture on events is reinforcing.  
Cross-cultural comparisons are necessary to fully appreciate the differences in how events are  
created, valued, managed, and experienced. In turn, events influence the places and cultures in  
which they occur, especially when mega-events are imposed on a culture that has not experi-  
enced such investment and media attention.  
Attachment to places, and place identity, can be influenced by planned events \(Brennan-Horley  
et al., 2007; De Bres and Davis, 2001\). Place identity and the branding of places via events  
have become a major area of research interest, with Richards \(2017\) pointing to their role in  
place-making \(i.e., how organisations create an external image of the place to attract visitors,  
investors, and to meet other societal goals such as re-imaging negative connotations with a  
place\). In the case of mega-events, architectural features such as stadia have been used to  
create a spectacle or attraction. Govers and Go \(2016\) identified the importance of authentic-  
ity and uniqueness in the place-making process by using events to ensure acceptance by the  
community, highlighting the significance of a grassroots or community approach. This was a  
theme expanded upon by Duffy and Mair \(2017\) in their analysis of the event encounter to tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events understand the importance of conviviality and social relations in community building by using  
small events and festivals. In the case of Expo events, Hereźniak and Florek \(2018\) found  
that citizen involvement enhanced the sense of community after the event. Every nation and  
community needs celebrations, and events that generate pride and a sense of belonging, and  
which build development capacity through volunteering, capital investments, and improved  
marketing.  
Hallmark events give identity and a positive image to their host community, while venues and  
resorts can also have their own hallmark events. The exploitation of festivals in place marketing is a  
worry to many observers fearing commodification, loss of cultural authenticity, and over-production  
of events. Some events achieve iconic status so they can occur anywhere and still be successful, but  
they always require specific venues or spaces and leave some kind of tangible legacy in terms of  
urban renewal, tourism and transport infrastructure, and social and environmental change.  
Embedded events\: Fiedler et al. \(2023\) used this term synonymously with community, home-  
grown, and grassroots festivals that are often found in rural \(or regional\) locations, use local  
infrastructure, involve the community in a bottom-up manner, and are volunteer driven. Those  
authors said such events are important in driving economic, social, and environmental devel-  
opment. Relate this idea to hallmark events, place attachment, and placelessness.  
51  
PlaceleSSneSS  
More and more event experiences are virtual, meaning they are not dependent on a venue or  
place. Some virtual events simulate an experience that is linked to a specific place or area,  
but the users are virtual participants who might be very remote from each other and from,  
for example, a simulated running course. Creators of these virtual experiences can, by design,  
facilitate user interactions, being the social component, and this might have the desired effect  
of linking users to each other. Linking users to a venue or place is more difficult, but there are  
possibilities with the use of augmented-reality technology.  
There is another dimension to placelessness, being the notion that the event could be held any-  
where, it is not place dependent. Foley et al. \(2012\) argued that many events are now decontex-  
tualised in time and space, meaning they are inherently portable and capable of being held at  
different places. The Formula 1 Grand Prix is one such event. A sport tournament or conven-  
tion shown on television, or online, might not give viewers any sense of where it is being held  
or the uniqueness of that place. An event might be so similar to many others that it makes no  
difference where it is held, at least in terms of the experiences facilitated. Events that are place  
dependent, on the other hand, cannot be separated from their venue or area, either in terms of  
the event’s specifications or because it has become a hallmark event co-branded with the place. A  
related topic is the difference between place and space, with spaces being a geographical concept  
and, in contrast, places having symbolic meaning.  
Events as product developers  
This is an emerging prospect for event managers and their stakeholders. During the pandemic,  
many events tried various ways to raise money, including online fundraising campaigns and  
virtual events. In effect, they were selling products, whether it was merchandise, participation,  
interaction with others, pre-booking, or simply charitable giving to a worthwhile cause. But  
consider the possibilities when an event is conceptualised as a creator of permanent products  
for sale, or permanent services available online. A starting point is to view the programme of 52  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
entertainment as a podcast or video for delivery at any time, globally. Add to that the prospect  
of providing educational, training, and consulting services to those who see the event as a  
model, or as embodying something they want to learn. While we view live events as being one-  
time only, and not subject to replication in terms of the experience, components of most events  
can be made permanently available.  
# Typologies of Events by Form and Function  
*Form*  
The classification, or typology, illustrated in Figure 3.1 is based primarily on the form of the  
event, that is, what it looks like and how it is programmed. But any event can fulfil multiple  
functions, facilitate similar experiences, and have many meanings attached.  
Form derives from the combination of various programme elements of style that make events dif-  
ferent. There are typical or defining characteristics associated with each, and these can be  
described as their hallmarks. For example, the hallmark of a sport event is an athletic competi-  
tion, a conference in its various interactive learning mechanisms, and a festival in its celebra-  
tion manifested in theme, symbolism, and emotional stimulation. Form is therefore a primary  
concern of event planners and designers or at least their usual starting point. The basic and  
generally accepted forms of meetings, sport events, fairs, and festivals can be taught, although  
in each culture there are going to be differences in their style and meaning.  
Historically, form has shaped professionalisation and led to the establishment of many pro-  
fessional associations around each specific event form. In this tradition, meeting profession-  
als have become the most organised globally, community festivals and arts festival producers  
have separate associations, and sport event managers attend their own conferences. Form is  
equally applicable to unplanned events. Every event has some form that leads us to call it a  
celebration, protest, riot, or party. What exactly are the cues or hallmarks? First, the way people  
behave, because people assembling for protests obviously behave differently to those getting  
together to celebrate. A casual meeting of friends or workmates looks and feels quite different  
from a spontaneous crowd celebrating the home team’s victory. Second, we can ask the people  
involved what they are doing and why they got together, and this should easily reveal whether  
the event is spontaneous or planned. That, of course, leads us to consider experience and  
meanings. Activity itself does not always reveal purpose or meaning. For example, if a celebrat-  
ing crowd spontaneously breaks into song and dance, we cannot call that programmed. But it  
is an activity virtually identical to what happens in many designed event programmes.  
*Function*  
Form and function are usually combined, as discussed below, but the reason for this separate  
typology is to emphasise that when an event is held to perform a function it does not neces-  
sarily matter what form or type it is. Furthermore, some event functions do not have to be  
planned, such as spontaneous demonstrations, protests, and celebrations or parties. If one  
wants to attract media coverage for publicity or propaganda, there are many ways to accom-  
plish it, such as by fabricating a publicity stunt involving celebrities or giveaways. Media events  
are defined by their emphasis on generating media coverage, especially when the event itself  
does not lend itself to spectating, but in fact, any event can be designed to maximise favourable  
media attention and related messages or images. Within the realm of tourism, place marketing, tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events and economic development we can use a number of terms, including mega, hallmark, iconic,  
signature, or major. Groups defined by sub-culture, online communities, gender, or politics can  
hold identity-building and re-affirming events that look like parades, parties, demonstrations,  
or exhibitions, but the function is paramount, not the form.  
53  
*Convergence of Forms and Functions*  
Forms and functions of planned events often overlap, and there has been a natural tendency  
for them to converge. For example, the Olympics were originally a celebration of amateur and  
youth sport, but they have evolved to incorporate professionalism, commercialism, and cul-  
ture. Each Olympic Games is mandated by the International Olympic Committee to include  
an arts festival. Host cities then piggyback conventions, exhibitions, and many other functions  
before, during, and after, all designed to leverage the event for other benefits. Television and the  
internet turn the whole thing into entertainment and spectacle, packaged in such a way as to  
maximise advertising revenue and publicity for major sponsors.  
A good example of convergence is the annual Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky.  
What was once a simple horse race \(it is iconic in the world of thoroughbred racing\) is now  
something much more. Their website describes the event’s mission as to directly contribute “...  
to the aesthetic, cultural, educational, charitable and economic development of the area”. Over 70 events  
are scheduled, a mix of sport, musical entertainment, spectacle, and parades \(https\://discover.  
kdf.org/what-is-the-kentucky-derby-festival/\). Four thousand volunteers make it happen. The  
Derby Festival is one of many community festivals across North America that celebrate the com-  
munity itself. Their appeal is wide, and so their programme is diverse. They defy classification  
as a single-form event, so convergence is one of their hallmarks.  
Convergence is a powerful argument for a generic approach to event management education.  
Professionals will have to be increasingly flexible and inventive, not restricted to just being  
meeting planners or exhibition designers, or festival coordinators. Also, working for venues  
means engaging with a diverse range of events. The other important aspects of convergence  
relate to their meanings and impacts. When conceived as instruments of policy and strategy,  
events can achieve wider appeal and greater impact by combining elements of style and form.  
To achieve greater economic benefits, larger and more diverse events are becoming the norm.  
To generate positive images, more television and internet coverage is required, reaching frac-  
tured target audiences. A conceptual model of convergence is presented in Figure 3.2, illustrat-  
ing how a range of functions \(i.e., achieving desired goals and meanings\) can be combined in a  
single event that consists of multiple forms. Community festivals tend to reflect this model, as  
do large sport events like Kentucky Derby that have become long-duration festivals. A similar  
model, incorporating exchange theory, was presented in the fourth edition of this book and is  
also fully discussed by Getz in the book The Future of Events and Festivals \(Yeoman et al., 2014\).  
*An Experiential Typology?*  
Function and form do not predetermine personal experiences, mainly because people create  
their own experiences within event settings, and will assign meanings to event experiences  
that can be loosely related to the event’s purpose and programme. Great experiences can be  
obtained without planned events, but event designers want people to have a great experience  
at their events. To date, most event designers have had to operate in accordance with estab-  
lished societal norms for event production – such as how to produce an effective meeting, how  
to programme an arts festival, or how to run a tournament. Many events are created pro-forma, 54

meaning they must follow specifications. Alternatively, the designer has to work according to  
instinct, within a creative mentality, and rely on both subtle and overt feedback to determine if  
the event experience was both pleasant and experienced as intended.  
We cannot easily develop a standard typology of events based primarily on experience, because  
so many possible experiences can be had at events. Both festivals and sports events can facil-  
itate joy, celebration, excitement, self-fulfilment, or aesthetic appreciation. While their form  
and functions might be completely different, at the experiential level \(and to some extent at the  
level of their meanings\) they can be quite similar.  
One example was developed by du Cros and Jolliffe \(2014, 46\), with their five categories of  
events bringing meaning and related experiential dimensions to the fore\: inspirational \(to build  
creative capital\); affirming \(for encouraging events that link to cultural identity\); pleasurable  
\(offering tourism, leisure, and recreational experiences\); enriching \(they facilitate personal  
growth\), and celebratory events that can celebrate issues such as cultural diversity.  
A phenomenological research methodology offers considerable scope for a better understanding of  
event experiences because it focuses on the individual’s state of mind while at an event. A  
full range of possible personal and social experiences tied to events is likely not possible, but  
certainly, the most memorable experiences people talk about can be identified – as long as we  
keep in mind the limitations of language and how people express themselves. For example, the  
section on experiences, and in particular the cognitive, affective, and behavioural \(conative\)  
dimensions of experiences, expands upon this theme, as do the sections on social worlds,  
involvement, and benefits.  
*Hallmark Events*  
Dictionaries define a hallmark as a typical characteristic or feature of something or someone, or  
a sign or symbol of quality. The first usage has already been mentioned, that of describing the tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events hallmarks of different forms of events. When it comes to ascribing quality to events, it becomes  
a little confusing, because various organisations like IFEA give awards in many categories,  
and adjectives like superb, the best ever, or incomparable, can be used by commentators and  
participants.  
The term hallmark event was first applied to tourism by Ritchie and Beliveau \(1974\) in their  
analysis of the impacts of the Quebec Winter Carnival. Later, J. R. B. Ritchie \(1984, 2\) defined  
them as\:  
Major one-time or recurring events of limited duration, developed primarily to  
enhance the awareness, appeal and profitability of a tourism destination in the short  
and/or long term. Such events rely for their success on uniqueness, status, or timely  
significance to create interest and attract attention.  
Ritchie identified a number of different types of hallmark events\: world’s fairs and exposi-  
tions, unique carnivals and festivals, major sporting events, significant cultural and religious  
events, historical milestones, classical commercial and agricultural events, and major political  
personage events. C. M. Hall \(1989\) expanded the debate on hallmark events, focusing on the  
issue of scale, defining them as events designed to attract national and international atten-  
tion to a destination. However, as Hall also argued, confining the term hallmark to large-scale  
events overlooks the community festivals and local celebrations which can be described as hall-  
marks, given their regional and local significance. Hall preferred to use the term mega-events  
to describe major events such as world’s fairs and the Olympic Games, as they are targeted at  
the international tourism market.  
One might also consider a hallmark event as being authentically embedded in a particular place  
or culture. These are recurring events that have become so closely associated with their host  
community or destination that the event is an important part of its image and branding. These  
events provide, and feed off, place identity. Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans have their Mardi  
Gras, Calgary has its Stampede, and Edinburgh its Tattoo, all permanent institutions in their  
cities, full of tradition and generating competitive advantages from a tourism perspective.  
For our purposes, the following broad definition is offered\:  
Hallmark events are those that possess such significance, in terms of tradition,  
attractiveness, quality, or publicity, that the event provides the host venue, community,  
or destination with a competitive advantage. Over time, the event and destination  
images become inextricably linked. Hallmark events are, by definition, permanent  
institutions in their communities or societies.  
If cities or resorts want to design a hallmark event, they need to meet multiple criteria and  
should keep in mind the power of convergence of forms and functions. Hallmark events usually  
attract tourists, generate positive images, and are co-branded with the destination. Such events  
also have to be acceptable to the host community, preferably becoming traditional and insti-  
tutionalised. The institutionalisation of an event was demonstrated by Lavenda \(1980\) in the  
political analysis of the Carnival of Caracas, Venezuela, where the old carnival was transformed  
into a highly organised, European mass event. As Lavenda \(1980\) illustrated, the wild, rowdy  
behaviour and attitude of a barbaric event were pilloried in the media to justify the creation of  
the civilising model based on the carnivals in Venice, Paris, and Rome to create a directed and  
institutionalised event - in which around 30% of the population became involved.  
To be a permanent institution \(see Chapter 8\) requires the demonstration of benefits to the residents,  
including the way the media portrays the negative and positive elements. Finally, hallmark events  
55 56  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
have to be planned with long-term sustainability in mind. That requires ­ taking a ­ triple-bottom-line  
approach to their intended outcomes, the involvement of residents at all stages, and concern for  
how impacts are evaluated in a multi-stakeholder manner. A full discussion of the meanings and  
planning process for hallmark events was published by Getz et al. \(2012\).  
*Iconic Events*  
An icon is a graphic representation of something, in other words, a symbol. To become iconic  
means an object or event is famous or influential, and this can also apply to brands. In popular  
terms, anything that is particularly newsworthy, or becomes mythic or legendary, can be con-  
sidered iconic. This is a quality that marketers desire when they create brand legends. It should  
be noted that these features of objects, brands, or events will vary from culture to culture.  
We can say that Mardi Gras stands for Rio de Janeiro or New Orleans, it is the city’s iconic  
event. An event that symbolises something of potentially global significance can be called  
iconic, such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics, because they are loaded with symbolic  
meaning. Many people want to attend such events because of what they represent, not where  
they are. And what they represent \(i.e., their meanings\) is, of course, of great interest in Event  
Studies. Hallmark events are also iconic, whereas not all iconic events will become hallmarks  
of their venues or host communities. Recalling the profile of TransRockies Inc. in Chapter 1, it  
can be said that their challenging events are iconic within special-interest groups.  
Premier or prestige events  
These events are defined within specific categories so that the World Cup is football’s premier  
event. Leagues can be called premier, relative to inferior leagues. All sports and special inter-  
ests tend to have premier events, being the top of the class, with the most prestige. While some  
are located in permanent places or venues, many of them move around. Some, like the Bos-  
ton Marathon, combine elements of iconic and hallmark status, given the media coverage and  
attention which the prestigious event brings to the location or nation. The bidding process to  
host these premier events has now become a highly competitive marketplace. The photo of the  
2019 Solheim Cup at Gleneagles, Scotland \(Plate 3.1\) illustrates a major sporting event won  
through bidding. In the golfing world, where Scotland places a lot of marketing emphasis, this  
event is considered to be the premier women’s international team competition.  
*Mega-Events*  
The term mega normally refers to the largest and most significant of events. It can also refer to  
the maximum size that can be accommodated within an area or venue, to the high cost, or to  
the exceptional media coverage or impacts accompanying the event. It is a relative term, and  
therefore often vague in its implications. The Olympics, World’s Fairs, and World Cup are typ-  
ically referred to as mega-events.  
The definition and implications of mega-events were examined in the AIEST \(1987\) conference  
proceedings in which Marris \(1987\) said that mega-events should exceed one million visitors  
and be must-see in nature, while Vanhove and Witt \(1987\) added that they should be able to  
attract worldwide publicity. But even a small music festival can have mega impacts on a small  
town in terms of tourists, economic benefits, or disruption. The term can also refer to media  
coverage and impacts on the image, as in “The convention attracted worldwide publicity and  
put the city on the tourist map”. Therefore, we suggest this definition\: tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events 57  
Plate 3.1 Solheim Cup at Gleneagles, Scotland, 2019

Mega events, by way of their size or significance, are those that yield extraordinarily  
high levels of tourism, media coverage, prestige or economic impact for the host  
community, venue or organization.  
The benefit of this definition is that it allows for mega-events to be situated within the con-  
text of a particular venue or organisation, rather than using a specific quantitative measure.  
Müller \(2017\) outlined six paradoxes \(i.e., contradictions\) associated with mega-events. They  
can be summed up as the apparent differences between what the Olympics promise, or its  
proponents claim, and what actually transpires – at least in the minds of critics. These same  
issues can be applied to other mega and major events, especially the ones that require bids and  
expensive infrastructure. They tend to explicitly promote internationalism but are owned by  
large, international organisations and funded by large corporations with global brands. Increas-  
ingly sustainability goals are set by event owners, but violated by hosts who cannot afford the  
implementation or simply run out of time. In some cases, host nations deliberately engage in  
counter-ethical and unsustainable practices. Winners of bids, as discussed later in this book,  
are often losers in financial terms, with debts passed on to the next generation; disadvantaged  
groups are especially penalised by such practices as clearing slum areas and ridding the streets  
of the homeless. Almost all such events are aimed at spectators, but most citizens of host  
nations can be excluded because of high costs and impossible-to-get tickets. Even the supposed  
uniqueness \(i.e., a once-in-a-lifetime\) nature of large-scale events is questionable, as the same  
models of competition, spectacle, and ceremony are repeated over and over. In the end, some  
people love them while others hate them.  
In addition, drawing parallels with Ashworth and Page’s \(2011\) assessment of urban tourism,  
a further paradox also exists. Large events need cities as central locations and spaces capable 58  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
of accommodating large audiences, but cities do not need mega-events, and many have voted  
against bidding on them. Duignan, Parent, and McGillivray \(2023\) posited the global-local par-  
adox and offered advice on how global priorities, such as those of the IOC, could be accom-  
modated by host communities wishing to express their values and priorities. They focused on  
residents and small businesses, both of which are often displaced when mega-event redevelop-  
ments are mandated.  
Olympic and mega-event studies  
People are fascinated by mega-events, those that by definition are the largest or most publi-  
cised. And so too are researchers, who continue to examine the Olympics, world’s fairs, and  
major international sport tournaments from every conceivable angle. For example, social sci-  
ence publishers have developed entire lists of books focused on the Olympics. A number of  
universities have established Olympic research centres in cooperation with the International  
Olympic Committee, and there are always new articles and books coming out on the Olym-  
pics, largely because every winter and Summer Olympic Games generate a flurry of interest in  
host countries. See, for example, Toohey and Veal \(2007\), who took a social science perspec-  
tive on the Olympic Games. In expert opinion 3.1 Dr. Talbot examines mega-events from the  
­ perspective of human rights.  
EXPERT OPINION 3.1\: By Dr. Adam Talbot  
Human Rights and Sport Mega-Events  
Dr. Talbot is a Lecturer – Events Management, the School of Business and Creative  
Industries, University of the West of Scotland  
We can think about human rights and sport mega-events on a spectrum, from those  
human rights impacts that are direct consequences of the event and its management  
to those which are practically unrelated to the event itself. For the former, we could  
include evictions to clear space for venue construction at Rio 2016 \(Talbot and Carter,  
2018\) or increased militarisation of public space for security purposes having a det-  
rimental impact on homeless youth in Vancouver prior to the 2010 Games \(Kennelly,  
2015\). For the latter, we could consider the Uyghur genocide at the 2022 Beijing Win-  
ter Olympics \(Boykoff, 2022\) or the criminalisation of lgbt people at the Qatar 2022  
World Cup.  
Event-related violations represent a concrete problem for event organisers. These are  
cases where the organisation of the event is in some way infringing on human rights,  
most often of the host community, but also at times the rights of performers and oth-  
ers involved in the event. In these cases, there is a clear need to rectify the failures in  
planning and execution that have resulted in violations of human rights. Conversely,  
non-event-related violations present a PR problem for event organisers. There is a  
need to effectively distinguish between the event and the violations of human rights,  
demonstrating the lack of connection between the two. This becomes challenging with  
mega-events that involve significant support from the state, which is often involved in  
non-event-related violations of human rights. This is a somewhat false dichotomy, as  
attributing cause to the event is often highly complex and there are many examples  
that sit in a grey area between the two ends of this spectrum, such as evictions that are tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events 59  
not due to specific event needs but occur in a climate of real estate speculation engen-  
dered by the event \(Talbot and Carter, 2018\), or the criminalisation of lgbt groups  
which serve as part of the national identity projected through an event \(Wolfe, 2016\).  
There is now a significant body of literature across a range of sport mega-events all  
around the world demonstrating how these apparent celebrations come to a violation  
of human rights in the host location. These range from evictions and gentrification  
\(Talbot and Carter, 2018; Watt, 2013\) to the repression of dissent through the militari-  
sation of security services \(Boyle and Haggerty, 2009; Kennelly, 2015\). Ultimately, these  
violations almost exclusively stem from the scale of construction associated with mega-  
events – not only venues but also new transport networks and urban beautification  
projects. Such enhancements to the urban environment are often explicit objectives of  
events, seeking to show the best possible face to the world and improve the lives of  
residents.  
One key reason such lofty aspirations often fail though is the scale of transformation  
within such a short period of time. Mega-event hosts are under intense pressure to  
undertake these wide-ranging transformations between winning the bid and hosting  
the event, often a period of six to seven years \(although this has expanded to around a  
decade in recent cases for the Summer Olympic Games\). This limited timescale creates  
a state of exception, a state of indeterminacy between democracy and absolutism,  
wherein democratic rules and norms are upended to ensure the event will be a success.  
As Boykoff \(2013, 11\) puts it, “the Olympics become an alibi for forging spaces of  
political-economic exception where authoritarian tendencies can more freely express  
themselves”. In other words, in the years leading up to the Olympic Games, the normal  
rules of democracy and human rights are suspended in service of the spectacle.  
In the context of mega-events like the Olympic Games, there is a vacuum of responsi-  
bility for human rights. As a hugely complex event involving a vast array of stakeholders  
engaged in different spaces, ambiguity over responsibility for human rights reigns. Who  
is responsible for safeguarding human rights in a host city? The organising committee?  
The International Olympic Committee? The host government? The lack of clarity cre-  
ates a situation where each can pass responsibility to the other, meaning often nobody  
takes responsibility for stopping violations of human rights. While the ioC’s recent  
human rights strategy does suggest taking ‘moral responsibility’ for human rights vio-  
lations in host cities, it stops short of admitting legal responsibility, which would enable  
victims to force the ioC to take responsibility and provide legal remedy \(Talbot, 2023\).  
As Diane Shelton \(2015, 17\) notes, “unless a duty is somehow enforced, it risks being  
seen as a voluntary obligation that can be fulfilled or ignored at will”. This is the current  
situation with violations of human rights linked to mega-sport events.  
While these event-related violations of human rights continue to be a concern, the  
association of human rights violations which are not directly caused by the event with  
sport mega-events has grown exponentially in recent years, leading to the coining  
of a new word\: sportswashing. This term, used to refer to deflecting attention away  
from violations of human rights using the mass appeal of sport \(Skey, 2022\), may have  
emerged recently but history is littered with examples. From gladiatorial combat in  
Ancient Rome, through the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany, sport has long been used  
by political actors to deflect attention away from negative issues. Initially coined by 60  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
Azerbaijani activists protesting about the 2015 European Games in Baku, the term is  
increasingly applied to sport mega-events, especially those that take place in autocratic  
countries.  
Perhaps the most prominent example of this is the Qatar 2022 World Cup. While sport  
mega-events have long been considered an effective tool to improve hosts’ soft power,  
the heavy criticism the event attracted stimulated discussions about whether soft disem-  
powerment could also occur through such events \(Brannagan and Giulianotti, 2018\). In  
particular, the issue of labour rights violations associated with the Kafala system, whereby  
migrant workers were unable to leave the country without permission from their employer  
or change employer when in Qatar, attracted heavy criticism. Thousands of migrant work-  
ers died under the system and their plight was heavily covered by Western media organi-  
sations, based on data from human rights watchdogs like Amnesty International.  
While FIFA claims credit for changes to the Kafala system in 2017 and 2020, changes  
welcomed by the International Trade Union Confederation, it remains to be seen if  
reforms will be reversed after the international spotlight moves on. However, the event  
itself was accompanied by a chorus of criticism in Western media, leading to Qataris  
and others to suggest Western media was unwilling to allow space for different cul-  
tures. While there is a well-established trend that mega-events in the Global South are  
covered more critically \(Manzenreiter, 2010\), the concept of human rights is, by its very  
nature, universal. That said, we should ensure that criticisms of human rights issues at  
mega-events are applied fairly. As Daniela Heerdt \(2020\) points out, the next two hosts  
of the Summer Olympic Games, France, and the usa have not ratified all un-agreed  
human rights conventions and both have been accused of violating human rights in  
recent years. But that does not excuse Qatar. Detailed and nuanced accounting of the  
human rights violations in mega-event contexts is needed – and sweeping generalisa-  
tions like sportswashing are often unhelpful to that end.

*Media Events*  
While any event can attract media attention, we use the term media event for those created pri-  
marily for broadcast or online audiences. An example is that of music award shows that relate  
to the power of television and the internet to reach global audiences \(Reid, 2006\). Examples  
also include surfing events that need to be heavily edited and packaged to make for good view-  
ing, and eco-challenges in remote places over long, arduous courses. However, any event can  
be packaged for the media, and that might be an essential part of its sponsorship appeal or  
necessary for receiving subsidies from tourism and government agencies.  
Publicity stunts  
Any event designed to garner publicity falls into the media-event category, but it is usually asso-  
ciated with politicians and movie stars. Publicity agents should be experts at contriving events  
or situations that appeal to the media, or to crowds so that they become news. But to the degree  
that they are obvious in their intent, or manipulative, they can easily backfire. Boorstin \(1961\)  
coined the term pseudo-event to describe staged or counterfeit events such as publicity stunts.  
*Cause-Related Events*  
These are established to raise money, generate awareness of an issue, or in general promote  
a cause. These functions make them part of social marketing. While any form of event could  
perform this function, common types of fund-raisers are gala dinners, concerts, entertainment  
shows, endurance events \(in which donors support participants financially\), sponsored sport  
events \(e.g., the UK’s annual fun run Race for Life, which has 300 local races to raise money  
for Cancer Research UK\), as well as celebrity sports and auctions. Events related to PRIDE  
are in a similar category, not to raise money necessarily, but to foster pride in identity, become  
mainstream and reinforce community bonds.  
*Corporate Events*  
Any event produced by or for a corporation fits this category, with common types being product  
launches, meetings, grand openings, and publicity stunts. An alternative meaning is a trend  
for large sport events in particular, like the Super Bowl, to become so tied to corporate spon-  
sors and related hospitality that they become corporatised. A further shift in the events world  
has been the emphasis on experiential marketing to develop brands and sustain relationships  
with customers and other corporate stakeholders. The term live marketing has crept into the 62  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
language to describe the use of events for these purposes. A related concept is the brand land, or  
the creation of venues devoted to brand experiences, and of course, these corporate monuments  
have to be animated with events. Ulrich Wünsch gives an expert opinion on corporate events  
in Chapter 6.  
*Spectator, Participant, and Interactive Events*  
These are descriptive terms that can be applied to many types of planned events. They relate  
directly to the engagement level and experiences of guests. Interactive events embody person–  
setting or person–person interactivity. Interactivity is thought to foster a higher level of involve-  
ment or engagement, making it a crucial element in experience design. To spectate means to  
view, so that at spectator events customers \(such as at a football match\) are inherently passive.  
The boundaries can overlap, however, as fans often get quite animated during games, and fan  
zones are routinely built for both viewing \(on screens, remotely\) and partying. They tend to be  
brand lands, owned by sponsors.  
Participant events are events that are held for people to be involved, and without them, there  
really is no live event. Participants are more than customers or guests, they are the reason  
the event is held, and in some cases, the event is created merely by the presence of people  
who decide to do something \(this can also be called a flash mob\). Meetings and conventions  
do not exist without delegates, there are no marathons without runners, and dance festivals  
need dancers. Exhibitions also require participants, namely, the exhibitors. Such events pro-  
vide targeted benefits \(i.e., they are customised experiences\) can be viewed as subcultural  
manifestations, and are highly sought after by competitive tourist destinations that can either  
create them or bid on them. For example, Coghlan and Filo \(2013\) examined participants’  
experiences and motivation at charity/sport events and the role of adventure philanthropy in  
such participation.  
Andersson, Armbrecht, and Lundberg \(2019\) classified participation events on the basis of the  
degree of co-creation, interaction, and activeness. Participants were examined with regard to  
involvement, serious leisure, social worlds, and event-travel careers. The concept of an event  
portfolio was discussed, drawing from literature on consumer constellations. This theory has  
been empirically studied on amateur athletes \(Getz and McConnell, 2014; Andersson and Getz,  
2020\), revealing the propensity of the highly involved to form their own portfolios of events,  
either specialised by type \(e.g., they stick to distance running\), or diverse across many events  
that offer similar benefits such as challenge and self-development.  
# Scale, Frequency, Duration, and Periodicity  
The size of events is an obvious variable, reflected in the term mega-event and generally implicit  
in contrasting terms like private function and party \(i.e., small\). Most attention gets focused  
on large events, which are also typically long in duration, whereas the innumerable small and  
brief events that occur every day are hardly noticed by anyone other than the participants. Sport  
events are held frequently, with rather predictable duration, whereas mega-events are occa-  
sional and tightly scheduled. We take it for granted there will be sport events of many kinds  
every day for our viewing pleasure.  
Periodicity refers to the cycle, such as the Olympics and World Cups every four years \(they are  
infrequent\), while most festivals recur annually. Some special events are occasional, with no tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events real schedule \(e.g., VIP visits, publicity stunts, and coronations\). A so-called one-time event is  
usually a recurring event that moves, such as the Olympics responding to bids, but there are  
planned events – like coronations, weddings, funerals, and anniversaries – that are intention-  
ally never repeated, at least not in the same context. One-off events should, by definition, occur  
only once.  
63  
*Small Versus Large Events*  
The vast majority of planned events are small and occur in the private or corporate spheres as  
meetings. But most attention focuses on the larger events that are open to large numbers or the  
general public, covered by the media, and generate substantial impacts. There is a continuum  
of planned events along the dimension of scale, and the extremes can also be associated with  
impacts and policy implications \(see Table 3.2\).

tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
*Frequency and Periodicity*  
Does it matter how often an event is produced? In sports, teams play many games during a  
season, and concerts or shows are also regularly held. What if a fan or patron goes to many of  
these events? They can become routine for participants, producers, and some of the audience.  
But we need to remember that every event is still somewhat unique. In fact, many people love  
sports because the action is infinitely variable and the outcome always unpredictable making  
them an authentic experience when compared with other forms of entertainment like TV and  
the movies. When sports get corrupted, however, authenticity disappears.  
No actors, musicians, or performers can exactly reproduce their efforts from one show to the  
next, consequently, the audience can return with some expectation of differences. Even fre-  
quently attended events can be special to the audience, depending on their expectations, mood,  
and interpersonal experiences. The timing \(or periodicity\) can also make the event special, as  
in the case of winter festivals occurring around the festive period.  
We are just as interested in scheduled, routine theatre and sports as we are in festivals held  
only every ten years, as well as what makes the timing special. Periodicity is a key issue,  
­ however, as one-time events are usually bid on, are expected to meet very specific objectives  
\(such as attracting tourists or generating profit\), and might never be seen in the host area  
again. ­ Hallmark events, by definition, should be annual and permanent, as they are co-branded  
with the destination or community.  
It can also be said that many so-called unplanned events occur frequently and regularly, as  
demonstrated by crowds assembling near major sporting events, in public spaces where street  
performers are regular attractions, and around holidays. The October 2022 disaster in Seoul,  
Korea, was one of those events tied to a regular calendar event - Halloween. The difference is  
that these regularly occurring events are not formally organised or advertised.  
*Activity or Event?*  
Events contain many activities, but activities are not, by strict definition, events. Activity is  
defined in various dictionaries as the state of being active, energetic action or movement, live-  
liness, or a specified pursuit in which a person partakes. A leisure or recreation activity is  
one that is pursued for its own, intrinsic rewards, and a business activity is pursued for its  
value-creating benefits or out of administrative necessity.  
Activities within planned events are mostly related to the theme, such as performances at a  
concert, matches in a competitive sport event, or presentations during a conference. Individual  
participants and guests at events engage in their own activities, often unscripted and personal  
\(e.g., talking, eating, bodily functions, singing along, cheering, viewing, and contemplating\)  
and these also contribute to the overall event experience. Activities at events are influenced by  
interactions among the setting, programme, and other people.  
Even so, the boundaries between activity and event are not absolute. From the individual’s  
perspective, engaging in a mountain climb, or any other adventure pursuit might be a planned,  
personal event with a purpose, design \(lots of preparations including a route to the summit\),  
tight schedule, specific setting, and often done in the company of others. In this sense, the  
activity of mountain climbing embodies specific events for the participants, but they are highly  
personal and not open to the public. Many people presumably reflect on their lives and careers  
as a series of events, and among them will be planned rites de passage such as anniversaries. This  
relates to the previously discussed idea of life histories. tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events 65  
*Length or Duration*  
How long can a single event be? Remembering our earlier discussion about the fact that  
all events are really part of a continuum of experiences for individuals and a congruence of  
multi-stakeholder activity, this question of event length is somewhat pointless. If we call it an  
event, then for all practical purposes it is a social construct with meanings.  
We frequently see lengthy events. The Cultural Capitals movement, which has been spreading  
globally, is usually a year-long event \(see Richards and Palmer, 2010\) with multiple events  
packaged within. In one sense, very long events of this kind are promotions, including the  
common Year of.... promotions, but they are certainly designed to be perceived as a single,  
noteworthy event.  
Duration becomes an important factor in cost and revenue calculations. An annual event held  
on only one day presents few opportunities for those in the tourism and hospitality business,  
although it might become a hallmark for the venue or area, with attendant publicity and brand-  
ing value. On the other hand, a one-time world’s fair \(an Expo\), spread over six months, offers  
a great opportunity for packaged tours and individual pleasure trips, augmented by meetings  
and exhibitions. Repeat visitation by residents of the immediate area can be a source of reve-  
nue, as multi-visit passes are likely to prove popular. As a general guide, an event spread over  
ten days, encompassing two weekends, yields ample opportunity for tourism promotion and  
maximising ticket sales and other revenue.  
Unplanned events are often tied to planned events, as is the case of protests and demonstra-  
tions associated with international meetings. Flash mobs have to be short in duration, as they  
usually intrude on private spaces and interrupt the regular flow of people and traffic. Celebra-  
tory assemblies, such as when a home team wins something important, will have a relatively  
short duration and frequently will augment a formal, planned parade or award ceremony.  
# The Specialness of Events  
Special means something that is distinct or exceptional, unusual, or unique. But what is special  
about any event is a subjective interpretation by either the producer or the guest. Jago and Shaw  
\(1999\) asked adults to describe important attributes of special events and discovered that the  
number of attendees, international attention given to the event, perceived improvement to image  
and pride in the host region, and an exciting experience were the main factors explaining perceived  
specialness. A list of factors that can contribute to any event’s specialness should start with its  
uniqueness \(Getz, 2005\) but includes these other major elements of style\: high quality, hospital-  
ity, flexibility, tangibility, affordability, convenience, symbolism, festive spirit, theming, tradition,  
and authenticity. Meeting multiple goals and appealing to different stakeholders and audiences  
adds to specialness, as in the previously discussed concept of convergence of forms and functions.  
Therefore, a special event can be defined in two ways\:  
1 A special event is a one-time or infrequently occurring event outside the normal programme  
or activities of the sponsoring or organising body.  
2 To the customer or guest, a special event is an opportunity for an experience outside the  
normal range of choices or beyond everyday experience.  
Another perspective on specialness is that of events aimed at special-interest groups, such as  
those representing serious leisure. Furthermore, events can be targeted to meet special needs and  
can include special effects. In short, the term is not very useful, except in a specific context. 66  
tHe Nature and Classification of Planned Events  
*Is There An Events Industry?*  
An industry, in conventional terms, means a sector of the economy that produces the same  
goods or services, such as the automobile industry. This definition is problematic for events  
because of their diversity of forms and purposes, and the fact that producers and suppliers  
might feel they are part of a tourism industry, an exhibition industry, or a cultural industry.  
Those in the arts seldom think of themselves as being part of an industry, because the word  
carries connotations of production for economic purposes, rather than art for the sake of art.  
Agencies charged with developing and promoting tourism often include events in their definition  
of industry, especially in the estimation of economic benefits, but that does not mean the event  
organisations agree or cooperate. Festivals and commemorations, art exhibitions, and musi-  
cal performances or concerts are more inclined to associate with culture. As Page and Connell  
\(2010\) demonstrated, a notable transformation in a post-modern society is the shift from tangi-  
ble elements of culture, such as the built heritage, museums, and monuments, to more intangible  
leisure resources such as image, identity, lifestyle, narratives of the city, creativity, and the media.  
All of these elements enhance the consumer’s experience of culture and its consumption in event  
experiences. For elaboration, see the book The Arts and Events by du Cros and Jolliffe \(2014\).  
There are also wider political explanations of why people use the term industry, typically when  
they want to legitimise their activities and gain governmental support. It is also common to  
talk about the service industry or industries, of which events are clearly a part, and increasingly  
to view events as being an integral part of the experience economy and creative industries.  
STUDY GUIDE  
It is important to distinguish between events \(and related terminology\) by referring to their  
forms, functions, and experiences. A typology based on event form was presented, and the main  
categories were discussed. These types of events are actually social constructs that emerged  
through tradition and common expectations of what, for example, a festival or convention  
consists of. By referring to their functions, a number of terms were identified – such as iconic,  
hallmark, and mega – that can actually describe many types of events. It was argued that events  
cannot easily be classified by reference to experiences, because multiple experiences are possi-  
ble within any event form. The convergence model should be examined in light of events that  
you know or that are in your area. What are they called, what is their theme and purpose as  
expressed by producers, and what meanings are attached by you and other stakeholders, such  
as the host community? Break down the activities or programme components to determine  
the extent of convergence versus a narrowly defined event by reference to form. Is it also a  
tourist attraction? Does it generate community support or opposition? Consider the variables  
of periodicity, duration, and frequency and how they relate to types of events, including the  
one-off and regularly scheduled sport or entertainment events - try to find examples that match  
these variables. Also, think about what makes events special, and link this idea to hallmarks,  
elements of style, and especially to uniqueness. Compare small and large events along a con-  
tinuum, rather than being a dichotomy, again with examples that exemplify the differences.

# Introduction  
This chapter explores the core phenomenon of Event Studies. As illustrated in Figure 1.3, we have  
to examine three elements\: all planned events, the experience of events, and meanings attached  
to the events and the experiences. We are including all social assemblies as events, but using the  
term planned events to distinguish this field from others in which the term event is also used.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003374251-4 Event eXPeriences and Meanings 69  
Our starting point is a discussion of how people actually describe their experiences, noting  
different connotations, and how the word experience can be used as both a noun and a verb.  
We then turn to theory on experience, drawing from psychology, anthropology, and social psy-  
chology through the lens of leisure theory. A model of the planned event experience is provided  
and others discussed. The notion of liminal and liminoid experiences and the creation of special  
places and times are central to the model. Meanings attached to events and event experiences  
are then examined from the perspectives of individuals, society, culture, economy, and the  
corporate world.  
# How People Describe Their Experiences  
In normal conversation, people might use the term experience in several ways, either as a noun  
or a verb. In each of the immediately following examples, experience is used as a noun. These  
statements illustrate key points, so a little commentary is attached to each. Note the use of  
the psychological terms cognitive, affective, and conative which are defined in greater detail in the  
ensuing section.  
I had an intellectually stimulating experience at the meeting.  
This statement describes the experience both in terms of cognition \(i.e., learning\) and affect  
\(attitude, or emotion\).  
The marathon was a challenging and exhausting experience, but I was exhilarated by my success!  
The runner describes her/his experience in terms of.  
l Physicality \(exhausting\), which is the conative or behavioural dimension of experience.  
l Feelings about it \(exhilaration is an emotional state\).  
l Challenging, in this context, can relate either to the physical experience \(they had to push  
themselves extra hard to complete the race\) or to a post-event assessment of meaning, in  
which case the runners might be saying they felt a sense of accomplishment or mastery  
in the achievement of personal goals.  
I am a person with lots of event experience.  
\(i.e., I have been to many events and learned a lot about them; there has been an accumulation  
of knowledge or skill\).  
The experience of attending my first World’s Fair was a highlight of my life; I will never forget it!  
The person is talking about being at the event, involving direct observation and a stream of  
consciousness; there is also profound, transforming meaning attached; it was memorable.  
We also use to experience \(the verb\) in different ways. Here are event-related examples\:  
As an event manager, I have experienced many near disasters.  
This is a simple statement about something that happened, not a value judgement, emotional  
reaction, or inference of meaning. It was something they lived through.  
I want to experience the excitement of a live music concert!  
This use of the verb is loaded with emotion or feelings, and it refers to the knowing and feeling  
that comes only through direct participation, or being there. 70  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
You have to get experienced in many tasks at real events before you can become a competent manager.  
This means undergoing a change, an accumulation of transformative experiences, and ­ becoming  
more knowledgeable and skilled.  
How people describe event experiences as they occur, and talk about them afterwards, is of con-  
siderable interest to event researchers and producers. It is certainly possible that events satisfy  
those in attendance at one level, but at the same time fail to achieve the organisers’ intended expe-  
riences \(such as learning, cultural appreciation, social integration, and increased brand identity\).  
It is also quite possible that events are determined to be successful in terms of desired outcomes  
\(e.g., money earned, attendance, and brand recognition\), but the experiences of guests are unsat-  
isfactory. For this reason, it is useful to briefly examine how psychology and other disciplines have  
contributed to the way we conceptualise experience as a key element of Event Studies.  
# Theoretical Dimensions of Human Experience  
*Psychology*  
The wider contributions of psychology to Event Studies are discussed in Chapter 16 where we  
look at different foundation disciplines. In this chapter, we focus on the psychology of expe-  
rience, a subject addressed by Benckendorff and Pearce \(2012\) within an overview of the psy-  
chology of events. Our basic frame consists of the cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of event  
experiences, or in other words, what people are thinking, feeling, and doing \(see Figure 4.1\).  
Cognitive psychology brings together a theory on memory, experience, and judgement, or how we  
think about, and make sense of stimuli from our environment.

Perception  
Perception is the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organising sensory infor-  
mation. As we gain experience, we develop frames of reference for incorporating and under-  
standing new stimuli and learning how to learn. These can be called mental models \(or maps,  
or constructs\), and in this way, all experience is somewhat transforming. As we mature, we  
move from passive receivers of stimuli to active searchers, both to learn more and to experience  
different things.  
One starting point is that of sensory perception. Bentley \(1924\) focused on stimuli \(i.e., things  
that stimulate the experience\) and receptors \(i.e., our senses that receive and help formulate expe-  
rience\). He pointed to the sensational elements of the human experience and the body’s ability to  
receive messages through five senses\: vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. A study by Toraldo  
\(2013\) highlighted the paucity of research on sensory issues and events, particularly the impact  
on experience and hedonism. He indicated that many sensory differences between humans are  
socially and culturally conditioned, and understanding these sensory issues in events hinges upon  
one key concept – anticipation. The event experience is dependent upon the expectation and antic-  
ipation of the experience and whether it is met. This has given rise to the expectancy-­ confirmation  
theory to explain satisfaction. As Jantzen \(2013\) argued, in any theorising about the experience  
we need to recognise the importance of reversal from one state of mind \(e.g., relaxation\) to  
another \(e.g., excitement\), and how our senses may arouse our emotions to a particular state.  
Memory  
We need to consider how past experiences of events often affect the propensity to return.  
Indeed, quite a few researchers have attempted to model the links between outcomes \(i.e.,  
future intentions, word-of-mouth recommendations, and loyalty through repeat visits\) and  
causal factors such as perceived event quality, price, involvement, engagement, activities,  
meanings attached, and what was remembered.  
Kim and Jang \(2016\) observed that past event experiences were a key to returning to events,  
focussing on the methodologies used to understand memory retrieval of events. Their study  
outlined the two principal ways that memory is researched\:  
l The semantic memory, where the context of the memory is based on the knowledge we have  
accumulated during our lifetime, affected by the experiences we have had over a life.  
l The episodic memory, which is a more autobiographical accumulation of events \(e.g., the times  
and places along with contextual information and more in-depth, detailed past experiences\).  
The episodic memory has been the focus of most event research studies of memory, with key  
concepts of communitas, desire, and belonging examined in these past experiences. However,  
memory alone cannot be the sole focus for understanding the event experience, as there is a  
growing recognition that anticipation and expectations must be understood.  
Recent developments in psychology, neuroscience, and chemistry, according to Beard and Russ  
\(2017\), have illustrated how event experiences can be made more compelling. They point to  
the importance of chemicals that drive the cognitive elements \(serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine,  
and endorphin\). Stimulating these can be a means by which positive emotions are created  
\(although there are also concerns that over-stimulation on a regular basis can lead to addictive  
behaviours\). As Beard and Russ \(2017\) demonstrated, understanding event experiences needs  
to relate to the way an event is constructed\: 72  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
l Socially \(i.e., the interaction with other people\).  
l Psychologically \(i.e., how this affects the self\).  
l Emotionally \(i.e., our feelings\).  
l Cognitively \(i.e., how it affects our mind\).  
l Environmentally \(i.e., the importance of place\).  
Personality  
Ego is a basic psychological concept, especially in Freudian theory, comprising that part of our  
personality that encompasses conscious awareness. It helps us make sense of the world, includ-  
ing separating reality from imagination. Our main interest is with personal identity, that is, who  
we think we are. As a loner, you might not connect with many people, but as a joiner, you likely  
belong to a number of social worlds and engage heavily in social networking. How we identify  
ourselves, say as a member of a particular sport or interest group, reflects our ego. We can seek  
and confirm identity through social arrangements, and that very much includes social events.  
Self-concept means the beliefs held about our self, including who we think we are in relation  
to how others view us, and how we would like to be viewed. When we drive a certain kind of  
car, we want it to reflect our self-concept or the image we have of ourselves as being sporty or  
eco-conscious. This also applies to being a sports fan, a runner, an artist, or any other form of  
leisure that generates an interest in planned events. Marketers know how to aim their products  
and services at people holding specific self-concepts, and clearly, these also relate to social  
world involvement. Funk \(2008\) employed self-concept in his approach to studying consumer  
behaviour for sports and events, namely, as an integral part of the “psychological continuum model”  
\(see also Baker et al., 2020; Funk and James, 2001, 2006\). Awareness, attraction, attachment,  
or allegiance are the progressive steps open to consumers and participants. Self-concept con-  
nects specifically to identifying with a sport, event, or team.  
Ego involvement is another closely related psychological construct much used in leisure research,  
and it is an integral part of developing theory on serious leisure and the event travel career trajectory  
\(see Chapter 15\). One does not get highly involved with a brand, leisure pursuit, event, sport,  
or social world unless it reflects our self-construct.  
Personality traits\: Psychologists speak of the big five personality characteristics or factors that are  
believed to “differentiate individuals in a somewhat permanent way and across most if not all situations”  
\(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997, 156\). Personality, as it affects leisure, has been scrutinised, but  
little has been done to connect personality to event-related behaviour. Here is a brief summary.  
Extroversion\: This factor includes traits such as assertiveness, gregariousness, and excitement  
seeking, leading to the label high-energy people. Extroverted people often pursue sports and take  
risks. Introverts, by contrast, have a low threshold of arousal and do not need as much stim-  
ulation. They are more likely to play computer fantasy games. Studies have found that travel  
preferences and styles correlate with extroversion or introversion \(Nickerson and Ellis, 1991;  
Plog, 1972\). Extroverts are also sensation seekers who are more likely to participate in adventur-  
ous, intense activities, and want greater variety \(Zuckerman, 1979\).  
Agreeableness\: Traits associated with this factor include trust, straightforwardness, and altru-  
ism, contrasted with hostility, indifference, and self-centredness. Agreeable people seek social  
settings and are more likely to volunteer. Self-indulgence and escape are more associated with  
low levels of agreeableness. Event eXPeriences and Meanings 73  
Conscientiousness\: Order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation are  
associated with this characteristic of personality. Managers might want staff who are high  
on this factor, as it is typically manifested in reliability, responsibility, and being organised.  
Stebbins \(1992\) thought that conscientiousness was associated with a strong goal orienta-  
tion and ‘serious leisure’. However, being high on this factor might also result in lower levels of  
spontaneity and higher compulsiveness. If one is low on this factor, impulsiveness and seeking  
immediate gratification are likely to result.  
Neuroticism\: A general tendency to experience distress is associated with neuroticism. Anxiety,  
hostility, depression, and self-consciousness are likely to accompany this factor. Dislike of play-  
ful leisure experiences might result from being neurotic. People with this trait might get less  
pleasure and enjoyment from both individual and social experiences by reason of discounting  
the positive aspects of their own lives.  
Openness to experience\: This is associated with aesthetic sensitivity, the need for variety, uncon-  
ventional values, flexibility of thought, cultural interest, and educational aptitude. Such people  
are likely to seek out sensory stimulation.  
Personality traits have been studied in leisure, although some researchers have concluded  
that personality has more of an influence on the extent of participation than on the choice  
of sport or activity \(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997, 163\). There is yet no research evidence  
to show the connection to planned events, but readers will see the possibilities for exam-  
ining event-related behaviour and experiences in the context of the following personality  
dimensions\:  
l Locus of control\: How important is it to perceive that you are in control or have the freedom  
to choose? Does this define your perception of what is leisure or enjoyable work?  
l Attentional style\: How do you typically process or deal with environmental and social stimuli?  
Can you easily get into the ‘flow’ of deep involvement in an activity or mental process?  
l Type A behaviour\: Some people are driven to compete and succeed and are always worried  
about getting things done; they feel they are running out of time and so they get impatient  
with others. How can they relax? How do you get them to pay attention?  
l Playfulness\: Are you a playful person, curious, creative, and joyful? Can males and females be  
playful together, or are there social constraints?  
l The Autotelic personality\: These people “are able to find intrinsic interest and enjoyment in almost  
everything he or she does” \(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997, 174\).  
l Shyness\: Shy people may feel a lack of control over their lives and have low social compe-  
tence, therefore, have a more difficult time finding satisfying experiences.  
Leung and Law \(2010\) reviewed the literature on how personality theory has been applied to  
tourism and hospitality, and much of this relates to Event Studies. They concluded that four  
main areas of application were related to consumer behaviour, human resource management,  
leisure, and education. Most researchers had examined one or more of the seven dimensions of  
personality, grouped as follows\:  
l Personality traits, most commonly the big five.  
l Biological factors that influence or are influenced by personality \(extroverts and introverts,  
with extroverts being sensation seekers; can include compulsions or impulsive behaviour\).  
l Factors within the mind that influence behaviour, which includes needs and motivation. 74  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
l The cognitive domain\: understanding of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and desires \(­ underlying  
stable motives and other conscious experiences from an individual’s point of view; includes  
locus of control and self-image\).  
l The social and cultural domain\: the public aspects of personality and relationships \(i.e., from  
social psychology\).  
l The adjustment domain\: related to mental health and how people cope; self-efficacy and  
­ pathological behaviour are included.  
l Brand personality \(how brand values connect to self-constructs and involvement\).  
Applications of personality theory to planned events are less common. It is relevant to  
­ volunteer and employee selection and behaviour because of stress, varying motives and rela-  
tionships, and conscientiousness. Event marketers will want to understand personality as it  
relates to information searching and buying behaviour, event and destination choice, and this  
encompasses psychographic segmentation such as that employed in ego involvement scales. Other  
useful applications relate to perceptions of event quality, learning preferences at conferences  
or taking risks \(as in many sports\). Spirituality is increasingly considered a motivator for  
travel and event participation, as is creativity. Personalities of leadership have been studied,  
but not for events. The personality of event brands related to consumer self-concept should  
be examined.  
Needs and wants  
According to Maslow \(1954, 1968\), needs are both physiological \(what we need to exist and be  
safe\) and socially learned \(what we feel we need in order to belong and be happy\). The follow-  
ing four were said to be deficit needs, and people instinctively seek to meet them. In times of  
stress regression can occur, but Maslow believed people normally move from the lower to the  
higher-order needs in a developmental process\:  
l Physiological\: survival needs, including water, food, and shelter.  
l Safety and security needs\: stability, order, protection, and structure.  
l Love and belonging needs\: social needs, a wish for affection and to show affection, and a  
sense of community.  
l Esteem needs\: hierarchical, with the lower order consisting of respect for others, status, and  
recognition; higher order including self-respect, competence, independence, achievement,  
and mastery.  
Others have argued that there are additional needs, and that the hierarchical nature of  
Maslow’s theory is unsupportable. However controversial, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has  
been influential, and is referenced again in our discussion of motivation. Needs get translated  
into wants, and some of these become economic demands for goods, services, and experiences.  
Needs can therefor activate behaviour \(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997\), and this also gives rise to  
­ expectation-confirmation theory.  
Self-actualisation and peak experiences  
Maslow’s hierarchy is often shown as a pyramid with ‘self-actualisation’ at the top. Maslow  
believed that certain people, only 2% of the population, could be called ‘self-actualised’, and  
they have many more ‘peak experiences’ than others. A ‘peak experience’ is available to all, and  
self-actualisation is ‘growth motivation’, or a process of seeking. Peak experiences were described Event eXPeriences and Meanings 75  
by Maslow as sudden feelings of intense happiness and well-being. They are non-religious,  
­ quasi-mystical, or mystical in nature, and possibly accompanied by awareness of ‘ultimate truth’  
and the unity of all things. Also, accompanying peak experiences is a heightened sense of  
control over the body and emotions, and a wider sense of awareness. The experience fills the  
individual with wonder and awe. Maslow also described peak experiences as self-validating,  
self-justifying moments with their own intrinsic value. They are never negative, unpleasant,  
or evil. They result in being disoriented in time and space, and this very much sounds like the  
liminal/liminoid zone of Turner, as well as Csikszentimihalyi’s ‘flow’  
. These experiences are  
said to be accompanied by a loss of fear, anxiety, doubts, and inhibitions.  
While these concepts have appeal and can be applied to event experience design, critics argue  
that anybody, whether good or evil, could have peak experiences. Furthermore, it can be argued  
that, despite Maslow’s beliefs, his views on self-actualisation and peak experiences have no  
moral basis. In other words, self-actualising people are not superior in any way. Others find  
these notions to be unscientific and untestable, even though they have some intuitive appeal.  
Benefits are what people believe they will obtain from consumption or participation, and these  
are generally expressed in terms related to need fulfilment. For example, of all the benefits  
provided by leisure services and sport, improved health is at, or near the top of the lists made  
by proponents of sport and sport events. No doubt exercise is important, but there are many  
ways to exercise without sport participation.  
Wants and Needs. People want many things or experiences, but that is not the same as needing  
them. Only the individual can decide when a want becomes a need, although society often  
makes judgements as to what is a basic need, and governments implement this through their  
social welfare and health policies. If governments create or subsidise events, it can be consid-  
ered to reflect an ideology that considers social and cultural gatherings as a need, or business  
events as contributing to the public good. Also consider that potential substitution comes into  
play, because many needs and wants can be met through different means. We do not need to  
go to a particular event unless it is forced on us \(that being an extrinsic motivator\). However,  
peer pressure might make us believe we need to go.  
*Social Psychology and Leisure Experience*  
Social psychology is the study of the behaviour and experience of people in social settings,  
which obviously applies to the world of events. In addition, our social relationships and the  
social contexts of our lives shape values, attitudes, interests, motivation, and what we pay  
attention to. This combination, or inter-disciplinary branch of social and behavioural science,  
has had a great influence on leisure theory and therefore on our understanding of leisure  
experiences.  
Social Cognition\: Bandura \(1977, 1986\) provided a framework for understanding, predicting,  
and seeking to change human behaviour, individually or collectively. The theory states that  
behaviour is a result of the interaction of personal factors, behaviour, and the environment.  
Social factors influence our beliefs and cognitive competencies. The environment modifies  
human behaviour, and in turn, people seek to change it. The same set of stimuli might result  
in different behaviour because people construe the situation differently.  
Self-efficacy is one of the key personal factors involved in Bandura’s theory. It refers to a per-  
son’s belief in their ability to perform a given behaviour successfully, which is different from  
a person’s actual competency. Self-efficacy influences motivation and leisure behaviour. We 76  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
are more likely to engage in activities that we think will produce desired outcomes, and this  
depends in part on our assessment of how well we can do the activity. Self-efficacy also affects  
how people respond to failure. In contrast, a person with high efficacy will attribute failure to  
external factors, whereas a person with low self-efficacy will attribute failure to low ability. Peo-  
ple with high self-efficacy are generally of the opinion that they are in control of their own lives,  
while those with low self-efficacy see their lives as being shaped by others, or by destiny. There  
are implications for education and training. Self-efficacy increases through mastery or success  
and diminishes with failure. It can also be increased through example, by learning from others  
\(especially peers and respected persons\) how to accomplish a task. Positive encouragement is  
also important.  
‘Social cognition’ is how we interpret, analyse, remember, and use information about the social  
world. Baron and Byrne \(2000, 80\) said that we employ schema which are “mental frameworks  
centring around a specific theme that help us to organize social information”. ‘Social role schemas’ apply  
to our expectations for the behaviour of ourselves or others in social situations, such as how  
lecturers act at a conference, how the master of ceremonies behaves at a gala dinner, or what  
a group of performers does at a concert. Schemas act as filters, saving us time and energy  
when we size up a social situation, and they are obviously based in part on experience and on  
cultural conventions. They have perseverance, generally lasting a long time. But they can also  
result in misconceptions and inappropriate behaviour if the cues we expect are not present, or  
are misleading. They can have the effect of self-fulfilling prophecy in that they can cause us to  
behave in ways that confirm them. We tend to notice only the cues consistent with our mental  
schemas, causing us to act in ways that confirm their validity.  
Theory of planned behaviour\: Originating with the work of Ajzen \(1985, 1991\), this very influen-  
tial theory posits that behaviour is driven by behavioural intentions \(e.g., “I fully intend to go  
to that concert”\). Intentions are a function of the person’s \(a\) attitudes towards the behaviour,  
\(b\) subjective norms, and \(c\) perceived behavioural control. The theory states that a person’s  
intention to do something is the most immediate determinant of behaviour.  
Attitude towards the behaviour is defined as the person’s feelings about the behaviour \(pos-  
itive or negative\), and this stems from beliefs concerning the possible consequences of the  
behaviour and the desirability of those impacts \(e.g., “I think rock concerts are cool places to  
meet and be with friends, and that is top priority for me”.\). ‘Subjective norms’ are the individual’s  
perception of what others will think, such as if one’s peers will approve of the behaviour \(e.g.,  
“All my friends think the X concert is going to be the best, and I want to be accepted by them”.\).  
‘Perceived behavioural control’ refers to feelings of choice \(including having skills, resources, and  
the opportunity to do something\). As in leisure constraint theory \(see Chapter 12\) people who  
perceive they do not have the skills, resources, or opportunities are unlikely to form strong  
intentions to go to events. The theory of planned behaviour applies only to uncoerced, ratio-  
nal behaviour, but not all event attendance or participation will meet those criteria. Extrinsic  
motives also apply to many events, such as work and social obligations. Irrationality might  
enter into the decision to attend events when, for example, people are in very strange circum-  
stances \(such as foreign cultures\) or suffering from altered mental states due to such factors as  
alcohol, drugs, stress, or illness.  
Self-determination Theory \(see Deci and Ryan, 1985, 2000\) is concerned with human motivation,  
specifically the development and functioning of personality within social situations. Within  
leisure, this approach asks if people really engage in actions with a full sense of choice. The  
social environment can either assist or hinder a person’s striving for growth, development, and Event eXPeriences and Meanings 77  
a coherent sense of self through the satisfaction of basic human needs. When needs are unmet,  
or thwarted, people can suffer in terms of general well-being and psychological health.  
Expectation-confirmation theory\: Oliver \(1977, 1980\) reasoned that consumer satisfaction is  
determined by the interactions of expectations and perceived performance, mediated through  
positive or negative disconfirmation between expectations and perceived performance. In other  
words, if the guest expects a high level of service, but perceives it to be poor, it will lead to  
dissatisfaction. A dissatisfied customer is unlikely to be loyal or to say good things about the  
service providers. This theory lies at the heart of SERVQUAL and other approaches to defining  
and measuring satisfaction, which have their origins in consumer behaviour research within  
marketing \(Baron et al., 2014\). Many researchers, however, believe that it is more practical  
and just as valid to measure ‘post-hoc satisfaction’, without a pre-measurement of expectations.  
Getz et al. \(2001\) used the post-hoc satisfaction approach in evaluating a surfing event. One  
convincing argument is that many people show up at events without clear expectations of ser-  
vice or product quality, but they can always determine afterwards if they are satisfied or not.  
On the other hand, the more experienced the consumer, the more likely they are to hold firm  
expectations.  
Leisure Experiences\: The nature and scope of leisure studies are reviewed in Chapter 16, includ-  
ing exactly what constitutes leisure and how it is different from work or extrinsically motivated  
behaviour. What is important here is the way in which we examine event experiences as  
leisure - even though many events are not intended to be fun. Experience is a fundamental  
concept in leisure \(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997\). Those social psychologists argued that we  
have to examine experience through the interplay of internal psychological dispositions \(e.g.,  
perceptions, feelings, emotions, beliefs, attitudes, needs, and personality characteristics\) and  
situational influences that are part of an individual’s social environment \(e.g., other people,  
group norms, human artefacts, and media\). As Kleiber \(1999\) argued, leisure can provide a  
basis for self-expression and potentially improve the human condition, particularly where the  
needs and barriers are addressed, and so it is potentially enabling for individuals.  
Optimal experiences are states of high psychological involvement or absorption in activities or  
settings. Maslow’s \(1968\) notion of the ‘peak experience’ \(“moments of highest happiness and ful-  
filment”\) and Csikszentmihalyi’s \(1975\) ‘flow’ \(“the best moments of people’s lives”\) occur “when a  
person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and  
worthwhile” \(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, 3\).  
Mannell and Kleiber \(1997\) discussed leisure experiences using the concept of ‘immediate con-  
scious experience’ \(or stream of consciousness\) which, to understand it, requires the monitoring  
of real-time behaviour. To be genuine leisure, the experience should be accompanied by a sense  
of freedom, competence, and control. For this reason, we need to understand the immediate  
conscious experience at events based on\:  
l Anatomy of the experience \(i.e., what happened to you? discuss intensity and duration\).  
l Moods, emotions, feelings \(i.e., self-evaluation of the experience\), intensity, relaxation,  
arousal, and activation \(bored/excited, energetic/tired, active/passive, and alert/drowsy\).  
l Involvement \(i.e., perceived duration; narrow focus of attention; ego-loss\).  
l Cognitive components \(i.e., ideas, beliefs, thoughts, images/imagination, and meanings  
attached\).  
l Sense of competence/control.  
l Sense of freedom. 78  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
*Anthropology and Experience Theory; Communitas*  
Victor Turner’s works on pilgrimage \(1979; Turner and Turner 1978\) defined liminality and com-  
munitas \(1974\), drawing from van Gennep \(1909\), have had a tremendous influence on tourism  
and Event Studies, including direct incorporation into models of the planned event experience.  
Whereas liminal experiences are associated with ritual and the ‘sacred’, liminoid experiences are  
part of the ‘profane’ everyday life, including festivity and carnivalesque, revelry, and role inver-  
sions. Liminality and communitas can occur independently of rites of passage, according to  
Turner, thereby making a clear connection to festivals and carnivals.  
‘Communitas’ is Latin for people helping people, or people coming together for the good of the com-  
munity. Turner stressed unstructured togetherness and a feeling of equality. Communitas can be  
spontaneous, erupting through joy and celebration, or a more permanent structuring of society –  
something akin to civil society. Turner \(1969, 132\) distinguished between three forms of communitas\:  
l Existential or spontaneous communitas\: the transient personal experience of togetherness.  
l Normative communitas\: communitas organised into a permanent social system.  
l Ideological communitas\: which can be applied to many utopian social models.  
Of these three forms, the existential occurs at events and is desired by many people who attend  
events. An interesting element of the ability of events to achieve this was reviewed by Stevens  
and Shin \(2014\) in terms of the geographical space within public event settings and the mean-  
ing derived from these. The degree to which event space is organised and the interaction of  
people within such spaces affect the encounters and engagement with the event which in turn  
affects the ability to achieve communitas. People want and need to come together in harmony,  
and this is reflected in Turner’s \(2012\) Communitas\: The Art of Collective Joy. This leads us to a key  
question\: Can events therefore be a springboard or building block to a higher level of societal  
communitas? Communitas is a goal of festivals and other cultural celebrations, as bringing  
people together as equals to share joyful experiences can have the effect of strengthening social  
bonds and developing a sense of community among members of a group or residents of a place.  
But it is not confined to culture or festivals, it can be an outcome of any type of social gathering  
either through conscious programming or as a side-effect.  
*Event Tourism Experiences*  
Ooi \(2005, 53\) identified six approaches to identifying and studying tourism experiences.  
The first derives from cognitive psychology and relates to leisure theory. Preconceived ideas,  
expectations, and perceptions affect how tourists consume, evaluate, and experience tourism  
‘products’  
. The second approach reflects a great deal of tourism literature, all based on the  
assumption that travel generates positive experiences. The idea is that tourism is a means to  
an end, resulting in learning, happiness, and nice memories. In the third approach \(again from  
leisure studies\) researchers concentrate on the state of mind and the depth of engagement,  
or ‘flow’ and ‘optimal experiences’. The fourth approach is ‘phenomenological’  
, as proposed by Li  
\(2000\) to describe the immediacy of personal touristic experiences through rich, reflexive, and  
intimate data. In the fifth approach, Urry’s \(1990, 1995, 2002\) concept of the ‘tourist gaze’ is  
employed, focussing on how travellers notice differences from their own environment and daily  
life. But because the visitor lacks local knowledge, their experience is a reflection of their own  
background. In the sixth approach, the theatrical analogy is used, as by Pine and Gilmore in  
The Experience Economy \(1999\), arguing that ‘engaging experiences’ depend on the degree to which  
tourists interact with the product. Event eXPeriences and Meanings 79  
Ooi \(2005, 54\) also suggested that tourist experiences are enriched or shaped by ‘mediators’  
,  
including guides, DMOs, and the information available. This helps to catch the attention of  
travellers and even to manage their experiences. Ooi argued that \(2005, 55\)\: “Tourism mediators  
craft tourism experiences by controlling and directing tourists’ attention”  
. People can only pay attention  
to one thing at a time, and we are easily overwhelmed by too much information or too many  
stimuli. When attention shifts, our experience is altered. Individuals are both drawn to differ-  
ent stimuli and react differently to the same stimuli.  
*Co-Creating Event Experiences*  
One of the main developments emanating from marketing research on the experience economy  
is the interest in co-creation, as part of the service-dominant logic paradigm \(Vargo and Lusch,  
2004, 2006, 2008\). As Van Winkle and Bueddefeld \(2016\) argued, it focuses on how satisfy-  
ing event experiences are constructed based on the concept of value. Holbrook \(1999\) iden-  
tified eight experiential types of value\: spirituality; ethics; aesthetics; efficiency; excellence;  
status; esteem; and play. These can be viewed as benefits of attendance and/or participation in  
events, the values co-created with event organisers, staff, and other participants/guests, or as  
motivators.  
Rihova \(2013\) examined six practices of co-creation observed at music festivals, reflecting  
the anthropological and leisure perspectives on experiences, namely, connecting; communing;  
bonding; belonging; amiability; and detaching. These ideas tend to reaffirm Verleye’s \(2015\)  
argument, based on social exchange theory, that people put more effort into the activity they  
undertake because of the return they expect to receive. Azara, Pappas, and Michopoulou  
\(2022\), introducing a special issue of event management on co-creation, suggested that it  
had to be considered alongside codestruction. Various stakeholders acting together, including  
the audience, are capable of destroying authenticity and local value through the process of  
commodification.  
*Guaranteed and Safe Experiences*  
How do we explain the popularity of theme parks and entertainment events, including many  
cultural productions? One answer is that they provide guaranteed and safe experiences. Their  
predictability, combined with perceived personal security, assures customers they will get what  
they expect, even though their expectations are limited in terms of cultural authenticity. In  
contrast, travel, and many event experiences, are somewhat unpredictable, with plenty of risks.  
If people are willing to sacrifice spontaneity, cultural authenticity, and surprise for the safe and  
mundane, that is a valid, reasoned choice. The more highly involved traveller, and the many nov-  
elty seekers of the world, will certainly continue to seek out special experiences.  
# Models of the Event Experience  
Our conceptual model \(see Figure 4.2\) is based largely on the social and anthropological liter-  
ature pertaining to rituals and communitas. It is not intended as a design model, but general  
design implications can be drawn. At the core of this model is a distinct experiential zone called  
liminal/liminoid. It is a zone that must be delineated in both spatial and temporal terms. This is a  
special place because of programming and how it is designed, all in preparation for the guests,  
viewers, or participants. Designers can make it special through decor, entertainment, activity,  
and sensory stimulations of all kinds, and they should use Falassi’s \(1987\) ‘valorisation’ concept 80

to make event-goers aware that they are entering a space/time that has been set aside for their  
special purposes. Similar concepts can be applied to a virtual event, but they will be lacking in  
the realm of human touch and interaction.  
Meaning is conveyed through opening ceremonies, symbolism such as banners or logos, and  
the theme. Some event experiences can be called sacred \(religious, spiritual\) and others profane  
\(fun, escapist\). However, it should always be a ‘time out of time’, to use Falassi’s terminology –  
that is, it should be perceived to be outside the normal, beyond routine, and unique. To the  
extent possible, all those involved with the event should experience the belonging and sharing  
that defines ‘communitas’.  
It is easy to think of a special place as an event venue, like an arena, theatre, or convention  
centre. But it can also be a temporary event space, or a whole community. The question of  
scale is important because as we move from a small venue to a large public space to an entire  
community, we have a much more complex and difficult job of design and programming, and  
a different type of experience. Nevertheless, many communities manage to make themselves  
festive throughout, or at least at important entrances and meeting places, during the time of  
special events.  
Before we get to an event, there is preparation and anticipation. Most people go to an event  
having some expectations of the experience to be obtained, or at least some foreknowledge  
that an event is about to be experienced in a certain way. Much research has been conducted  
on motivation to attend events, especially festivals, and it mostly confirms the ‘seeking–escaping  
theory’ of Iso-Ahola \(1980, 1983\) suggesting that people are both getting away from personal  
and inter-personal stressors while at the same time looking for beneficial, rewarding experi-  
ences. Therefore, they will clearly anticipate that an event is going to be out of the ordinary.  
You could stumble upon an event and be surprised, but even so, there will be a sense of having  
left somewhere and arrived at some special place. Even where expectations are completely  
absent \(i.e., the event-goer never gave it any thought at all\) there still has to be an entrance,  
in both physical and perceptual terms, that marks a transition from ordinary to extraordinary.  
For online events, this entrance is mechanistic to begin \(e.g., signing into a Zoom meeting\),  
but should be followed by a welcome and orientation.  
Csikszentmihalyi’s \(1975, 1990\) ‘theory of flow’ fits into this model. It suggests that people seek  
‘optimal arousal’, leading to ‘flow experiences’ which can be characterised by deep involvement, Event eXPeriences and Meanings 81  
intense concentration, lack of self-consciousness, and transcendence of self. These are intrin-  
sically rewarding experiences. To the extent that designers can facilitate flow, event-goers can  
be expected to report exhilaration from fantasising, or total immersion in music or activity, a  
sense of accomplishment \(e.g., through athletic achievement, mastery of a skill, or intellectual  
stimulation\) or transformation through an intense emotional or spiritual process. How to fos-  
ter a high level of involvement is the real challenge, and events that provide only spectacle or  
entertainment will find this illusive.  
Liminality is not strictly dependent upon the type of event or venue. This space/time exists in  
the minds of the attendees and participants, not within the programme or venue itself. It can  
therefore be entered through the pathways of fantasy \(the focus of many theme parties\), a will-  
ing suspension of disbelief in order to play a role \(as in carnival\), engagement in new ideas and  
processes \(such as discourse, clinical learning, and team projects\), participation with others  
\(a celebration\) or any kind of higher-than-usual level of involvement.  
In the case of flash mobs and other events at the fringe, it is the participants who, according  
to some unwritten script or external prodding, largely make their own experiences. They are  
temporarily using \(or liberating\) space for their purposes, perhaps making a social or political  
statement in doing so, but quickly returning it to the ordinary. Reversion to normal life should  
be accompanied by a sense of change, going from the special to the ordinary. There might be  
a feeling of accomplishment, renewal, transformation, relief, or loss. It is important to feel  
something at the end, otherwise, what was special or memorable about the experience? It may  
be possible to feel a sense of loss at the end of conferences, not necessarily because the stim-  
ulating programme is over, but because of separation from friends and colleagues. This is the  
loss of communitas, and it leads to the desire to attend future events. Anyone who is highly  
involved or emotionally moved by events will experience this loss. It gives meaning to the  
event, and to our ordinary lives.  
To the extent that people enjoy events, or at least derive some benefits from attending, they  
might very well develop an event career. Similar to a ‘travel career’ \(Pearce and Lee, 2005\), we  
learn from events and perhaps desire more of the same \(becoming a loyal festival-goer\), or we  
crave the uniqueness, even surprises that come from many different types of events \(becoming  
a cultural event tourist\), or we want an ever-increasing challenge \(being the amateur, competi-  
tive athlete\). In fact, nostalgia has a clear role to play, as demonstrated by Fairley and Gammon  
\(2006\).  
O’Dell \(2005, 133\) argued that we must not over-emphasise the disjuncture from ordinary  
life when we consider liminal or liminoid experiences. His point was that touristic and event  
experiences can only be special or exceptional when considered in light of one’s ordinary life  
and experiences. He said\: “To a large extent people learn the ropes of ‘experiencing’ through their daily  
consumption patterns. We also need to develop competencies for experiencing, and this is embodied in the  
concepts of serious leisure, specialization, and self efficacy”  
.  
A related and somewhat expanded model was developed by Richards \(2019, 86\) based on De  
Geus, Richards, and Toepoel \(2016\). This model emphasises that experiences are the result  
of interactions between event-goers and their physical and social environment \(i.e., the event  
setting\), modified by the level of engagement and/or involvement. A variety of experiences can  
occur, as outcomes, anywhere in the visitor journey - which is represented by the five travel  
phases of Clawson and Knetsch \(1966\). A number of conditions are specified, including per-  
sonal characteristics. It was also noted that their model is similar to those of Falk and Dierking  
\(2011\) and Cutler and Carmichael \(2010\). 82  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
Jafari’s \(1987\) anthropologically based model of the travel experience should also be men-  
tioned in this context. That model depicted six integrated components\: Corporation, Emanci-  
pation, Animation, Repatriation, Incorporation, and Omission. Travellers \(these could be event  
tourists\) were said to move from the ordinary to the non-ordinary and then back again, accom-  
panied by a feeling of freedom \(called ‘emancipation’\). ‘Animation’ refers to the travel itself, a  
form of longer-term mobility marked by leaving home for a substantial period of time \(at least  
beyond one’s daily routine\) to one or more destinations. The tourist could seek immersion  
in the destination or simply be a viewer or spectator. ‘Incorporation’ refers to how the tour-  
ism experience affects the person when back home, being potentially transformed by travel  
experiences.  
*Event Experience Scale \(EES\)*  
A number of methods can be employed to investigate and quantify event experiences, start-  
ing with phenomenological approaches in which the guest or participant is asked to describe  
what they are doing, thinking, and feeling while actually on-site. This method unfortunately  
distracts respondents and might very well modify their experience in unpredictable ways. Nev-  
ertheless, it has the potential to reveal a great deal about interrelated experiential dimensions.  
For example, the simple act of eating or drinking at an event is likely to be a social occasion,  
possibly marked by a heated debate, with entertainment in the background \(i.e., at the same  
time a cognitive, affective, and conative experience\). Leisure and event researchers can take  
advantage of technology to explore experience while it happens. Wearing monitors, research  
subjects can reveal changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or other indicators of how they are  
reacting to stimuli or coping with stressors.  
For survey research \(self-completion or interview\), De Geus, Richards and Toepoel \(2016\)  
developed an 18-indicator Likert scale. The first three dimensions of this scale reflect psy-  
chological theory as previously discussed, while the fourth – experiencing novelty – emerged  
from the research that led to scale development. The 18 indicators raise a number of ques-  
tions related to what exactly leads to \(for example\) excitement or learning. The social factor  
cannot be ignored, as social interaction is a primary motivator for attending events. Else-  
where in this book, we discuss generic and event-specific motivators, and these have to be  
taken into account when studying event experiences. While feelings of belonging and sharing  
\(i.e., communitas\) are likely to dominate certain events where sub-cultures and communities  
of interest meet, we need to understand what it is about the event that leads to dominant or  
peak experiences.  
Coetzee et al. \(2019\) tested the scale at a sport event and linked results to future inten-  
tions. Results suggested that affective and physical engagement were important in creating  
memorable experiences, and this led to increased participation, support, and commitment  
towards the event. Coetzee and Pourfakhimi \(2020\) confirmed the presence of the four  
basic dimensions of the EES for different types of events in different contexts and found that  
excitement was the most powerful predictor of behavioural intentions. Biaett and Richards  
\(2020\) applied the scale to seven cultural events in different countries, as well as examining  
antecedents and outcomes, finding the cognitive dimension to be strongest. This finding  
probably reflects the differences between cultural events and other types where activity is  
more important. Event eXPeriences and Meanings 83  
# Virtual Event Experiences  
As virtuality has increased dramatically, especially for meetings, and as a result of the pandemic  
for other types of events, questions arise about how satisfying they are to participants, and the  
nature of the virtual experience. Wreford et al. \(2019\), through an experiment, learned that VR  
does provide emotional gratifications. However, they concluded that in its current form, VR does  
not provide the same social and sensory gratifications as live events. Richards \(2022\) drew on  
work by the Atlas Events Group in testing the EES in a range of contexts internationally. It was  
concluded that there are significant differences between physical and virtual event experiences.  
Regarding respondents’ perceived experience of virtual events during the pandemic, Richards  
found that the level of satisfaction was lower than for live events. He suggested that hybrid events  
could offer a better experience than those which were exclusively digital in nature.  
Yung et al. \(2022\) developed a typology of virtual events with implications for tourism, hospi-  
tality, and events. Their model is a cube with three dimensions\: the reality-virtuality continuum  
\(from completely synthetic interactions, such as gaming, to live social events\), location \(from  
live and social to isolated and completely linked by technology\), and social presence on a qualita-  
tive continuum of low to high, meaning the degree to which participants feel they are together,  
as opposed to telepresence where users feel they are actually in the virtual environment. Social  
presence is critical when engagement and interaction are desired \(as in a conference\), other-  
wise, participants become mere spectators who can easily tune out the proceedings.  
Yung et al. \(2022\), and other commentators, have made a case for expanding virtual events  
as a way to reduce carbon emissions and achieve other sustainability goals such as improving  
accessibility for people who cannot easily travel or cannot afford it. To do so requires greater  
accessibility through equitable provision of the necessary technology, and efforts to improve  
virtual experiences. Efforts to enhance virtual experiences include the following\:  
l Facilitated interaction/networking\: chat rooms specifically for remote attendees; speed  
meetings for face-to-face contacts between remote attendees.  
l Emotional stimulation\: guests attend a wedding or other event remotely, but experience the  
emotions of live attendees.  
l Immersive activities\: requiring participants to demonstrate they are paying attention by having  
them give specific inputs and evaluative feedback; online tests as part of training; submission of  
sketches or outlines for group consideration \(and possibly voting\); Q and A at regular intervals.  
l Hybrids\: virtual cooking lessons and tastings that provide tangible products, sent to consum-  
ers in advance of the lessons; can be combined with destination virtual tours \(e.g., a specific  
winery, wine region, kitchen in a chateau, etc.\); after-attendance rewards \(gifts, coupons, etc.\).  
l Value-adding for virtual participants\: e.g., meet the professor, artist, or musician \(not avail-  
able to live attendees\); novelty, such as online animations \(virtual characters\) during events,  
and the use of avatars for online dating/partying.  
l Surprise\: programming or benefits only for digital audiences.  
Brown \(2021\) discussed the development and design of virtual events, with attention to the  
issues of facilitating immersion and interactions. Technical equipment needed for virtual and  
hybrid events was detailed. Brown and Drakeley \(2023\) provided a case study, with teaching  
notes, on virtual event design. 84

EXPERT OPINION 4.1\: By Valentina Gorchakova and Ekaterina  
Berdysheva  
Agility of Business Events\: Case Study of SHIFT Business Festival  
Valentina Gorchakova, PhD, is an experienced academic and marketing professional.  
Valentina is currently a Senior Lecturer and Programme leader of an online Business and  
Management bsc programme at the University of Derby, uk.  
Ekaterina Berdysheva, msc, is a finance and project management professional. Ekater-  
ina was in charge of international development at SHIFT Business Festival in 2020 and  
is currently working as events coordinator at Visual Components, a leading developer  
of 3D simulation software from Finland.  
SHIFT Business Festival is an annual two-day networking event that combines speaker  
line-up, workshops, round-table discussions, and expo-like business visibility opportu-  
nities. It was founded in 2015 in Turku, Western Finland. The programme has covered  
global mega-trends and the specifics of the regional business environment. A distinct fea-  
ture of SHIFT has been its unusual venues, including a medieval castle, a former prison,  
and an old shipyard. The number of participants has been rising gradually, from around  
1,000 people in its first year to 3,000 visitors from more than 40 countries in 2019.  
As the Covid-19 pandemic was unfolding in 2020 and many events were cancelled,  
the SHIFT team demonstrated agility by choosing the event design and format that  
would allow the festival to go ahead under the existing uncertainty of lockdowns and  
government restrictions. The festival took place on a virtual platform as an online event  
on 27–28 October 2020.  
Organisational agility can be viewed as a dynamic capability, i.e., the capacity to sense  
opportunities and threats and solve problems under changing circumstances \(Van  
Oosterhout et al., 2006; Winby and Worley, 2014\) and it is often associated with the  
speed in responding to changes \(Gong and Janssen, 2012\). Agility encompasses such  
processes and activities as marketing, design, organisation, management, and people  
\(Aitken et al., 2002\); it can also be seen as an integrated set of behaviours \(Hallanbeck,  
2016\). Agility requires adaptability to emerging circumstances, recognising challenging  
situations as opportunities for growth and innovation – from the adoption of new tech-  
nologies to new business models or formats \(Doz and Kosonen, 2008\).  
As events are experiential products with both ‘personal’ and ‘social’ dimensions, their  
marketing can be a demanding, challenging, and a highly creative task \(Gorchakova,  
2020\). Marketing agility requires ‘sensemaking’, i.e. the ability to respond to chang-  
ing, and sometimes unexpected developments in the marketplace \(Kalaignanam et al.,  
2021; Moi and Cabiddu, 2022\) and ‘iteration’ – a continuous adjustment of marketing  
efforts to meet the changing requirements and needs of the consumers \(Hughes and  
Rajesh, 2021\). Agility is also closely associated with collaborative and integrated work-  
ing environments and continuous innovation \(Moi and Cabiddu, 2021a, 2021b\).  
SHIFT festival organisers made changes to the format of the event, initially opting  
for a hybrid event format that would combine features of online and on-site events.  
The timeframe of the event was extended from a two-day event to a two-month  
series of events that started with a kick-off in August on the original dates of the Event eXPeriences and Meanings 85  
festival, continuing with bi-weekly expert webinars delivered by the festival’s part-  
ners, and culminating in the main event in October. The webinars allowed attend-  
ees more time to familiarise themselves with the new online format, as well as the  
themes of the event. The capacity to sense opportunities and pursue innovative  
solutions in programming demonstrates an agile approach to event management  
of the festival.  
To maintain the traditional SHIFT atmosphere where people can walk around and  
“bump into each other”, a 3D virtual platform was chosen as an event ‘venue’. Event  
participants could join the event as avatars and could move around the 3D festival  
between locations, talking with other attendees via voice or text chat. To facilitate net-  
working for participants, a business-to-business ‘matchmaking’ tool was introduced.  
These decisions showed agile marketing whereby event organisers were making adjust-  
ments to meet participants’ expectations and needs.  
The main event took place on the virtual platform Virbela \(see Plate 4.1\). Presenters  
delivered their keynotes as avatars or joined a live broadcast from a studio in Turku.  
About 20 showcased their products and services in the Virbela expo hall through cus-  
tomised virtual booths of four different sizes.  
There were a number of challenges that the team had to address in the run-up to the  
event. Just three weeks before the main hybrid event, the restrictions for live events  
in Finland were tightened and it became impossible to organise the on-site part of  
the festival that was originally planned. Following the action plans that had been  
developed for different scenarios and contingencies, the festival was moved to a fully  
online, rather than hybrid, mode. All changes were communicated to the participants  
promptly. Those who got on-site tickets joined the fully virtual event in 2020 and got  
complimentary passes to the next year’s festival.

Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
Another challenge emerged from the technological side. Less than a month before the  
event it transpired that the live stream was not possible to be brought directly into the  
platform due to compatibility issues of the camera stream and the browsers. This was  
resolved by the production team by using a video mixer on a separate computer that  
‘tricked’ the Virbela platform into believing this was the webcam.  
On the programming side, getting all the speakers to submit their materials on time  
and in formats compatible with the software was another task for the event organisers.  
Presenters joining live from a studio in Finland had a different technological set-up. It  
required significant efforts from the production team to mitigate and resolve all the  
concerns that were new due to the online format, as they were emerging.  
The way in which SHIFT organisers were addressing continuous challenges while con-  
sidering the overall event experience for the participants demonstrated their commit-  
ment to the shared purpose \(Winby and Worley, 2014\) and ‘visionary management’  
\(Malaska and Holstius, 1999\). Organising an event in a complex and highly uncertain  
context of the global pandemic required agility, commitment, and dedication of all  
members of the team.  
The festival and networking events were attended by over 1,000 visitors from more  
than ten different countries in two days, with more than 300 business meetings having  
taken place. The vr format managed to engage attendees, who stayed at the event  
platform for a longer time as compared to face-to-face webinars and were able to meet  
more people. Participants appreciated the uniqueness of the experience, such as shak-  
ing hands and speaking in groups, as well as the opportunity to move between different  
event locations, the ability to virtually dance with the avatar at a beach after-party to  
streamed live music, or to virtually do a boat trip with other attendees.  
It was important for the organisers to keep the event running and relevant and to  
maintain the values and spirit of the festival. The team demonstrated agility across all  
areas of event management, from event design to team management, expanding the  
network of stakeholders and embracing innovation in uncertain and challenging times.  
Despite the changes that had to be introduced, the SHIFT festival managed to maintain  
continuity with the previous iterations.  
There is a potential for future research to explore various ways that agility can manifest  
itself in specific areas of event management, as well as investigate best practices such  
as new technologies implementation, event operations, event marketing, and event  
leadership.

# Meanings Attached to Events and Event Experiences  
An important point has already been made\: the purpose, meanings, and intended experience  
designed by event producers might not correspond with the purpose of visitors, the experi-  
ences they have and remember, and the meanings they attach to the event and their experi-  
ences. Therefore, when it comes to evaluating experiences, measuring perceived quality and  
satisfaction, or questioning engagement and future intentions, it has to be kept in mind that  
these are different from assigning meaning. The whole point of taking a family to a festival,  
for example, might be to have quality time together. The personal meaning is therefore linked  
to the motivation, but the same family might assign meaning to the festival as a reflection of  
cultural authenticity and take pride in their community for being the host.  
When we explore value, we encounter the concept of utility \(the value people put on it because of  
benefits obtained, or because it offers them choices\), versus value assigned because it preserves  
traditions or has value for others or the community in general. Utility relates to personal mean-  
ings, the others are meanings given to events based on assessments of value for others. Event  
experiences can mean as little to us as fleeting entertainment \(not important and not memora-  
ble\), or they can be profoundly transforming. To a community or society, events can have simple  
commercial meaning, as part of the entertainment industry, or they can be significant economic  
and place marketing value creators. From a cultural perspective, events can be reinforcing or  
threatening. From an economic and tourism point of view, events are products to sell, and they  
must generate tangible as well as image benefits. And to corporations that sponsor or produce  
events, they have importance in terms of marketing, branding and corporate responsibility. 88  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
Meanings attached to planned events are at once anticipatory \(as in, “We are going to the  
festival to celebrate our heritage”.\), evolving \(e.g., “The event itself was responsible for  
changing everyone’s attitudes toward the arts”.\), and reflective \(such as, “Looking back,  
it was clearly an event with great economic and political importance”.\). Historians, and  
critical researchers, help to attach meanings to events. So do political ideologies and the  
interactions of all the stakeholders involved. Meanings that are political and societal might  
not impress the individual, who is, after all, able to formulate personal interpretations and  
meanings for any event. But, if events have little or no meaning of importance to people,  
they will not attend. If events lack social, cultural, and economic meaning, who will support  
them?  
*Personal Meanings*  
The meanings that individuals attach to event experiences are personal constructs, which can  
be defined as a level of cognitive significance that represents how we understand the world  
around us. In effect, we construct reality in our minds to explain experiences. Personal con-  
struct theory posits that people attribute meanings to their experiences, and each person  
therefore has different experiences. Kelly \(1955\) theorised that a person’s experiences con-  
sist of “a set of personally construed events” that are not necessarily valid. That is, we might not  
get it right – they are subjective and subject to change. Based on our experiences we can  
anticipate and predict future experiences, which of course influences what we expect from  
a planned event.  
Epting and Neimeyer \(1984, 2\) argued that these personal constructs “serve not only as inter-  
pretation of past events but as hypotheses about events yet to be encountered”  
. Botterill and Crompton  
\(1996\) used personal construct theory to examine leisure/tourist experiences and concluded that  
emotional states are integral to ‘optimal experiences’ as defined by interviewees. At one level,  
we can say that personal meanings relate directly to personal needs, the motives expressed for  
attending events, and the anticipated benefits to be obtained through the planned event experi-  
ence. Ask yourself how you give meaning to your life through work, leisure, and family. Where  
do events fit into that meaning system? The rites of passage that mark our lives are bound to be  
memorable, and full of personal meaning, helping to define who we are. But most of them, like  
birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and graduations, are also social occasions, with substantial  
meaning to families and wider social networks.  
Experience marketers have also realised that they must engage consumers in events that  
hold meaning for them. Diller et al. \(2006, 3\) in Making Meaning argued that companies  
seeking competitive advantages have to provide meaning to consumers through the prod-  
ucts and services being offered. This is similar to the concept of services as value creators.  
The personal benefits and meanings can be quite varied, from communitas and self-­ esteem  
to personal development and transformation. Improved health and learning are often  
important.  
People might not be able to articulate the meanings they assign to event experiences. They  
might not think of meanings at all. You could ask them what benefits they expected and derived  
from the experience, and that comes close. They can be asked to respond to a list of statements  
or adjectives about the event to see if they found it memorable, transforming, or meaningful in  
terms of the above-mentioned dimensions. People want to give meaning to their experiences  
and to their lives in general, but expressing those meanings requires deep thought and a good  
vocabulary! This is a real challenge for researchers and theorists. Event eXPeriences and Meanings 89  
*Social Meanings*  
These are meanings given to events by social groups, communities, and society as a whole.  
Individuals are not only affected by these meanings but are also able to make their own inter-  
pretations of events. Event types or forms, as previously discussed, are to a large extent social  
constructs, with collectively assigned and generally recognised meanings. Abrahams \(1987\)  
noted that the way we frame or attach meaning to experiences is embedded in social and cul-  
tural order. Our most popular religious holidays and civic celebrations have generally accepted  
meanings. For many people, the sacred might have given way to the profane for holidays like  
Christmas, nevertheless, society as a whole recognises the social and personal benefits of these  
holidays, despite some differences in meanings attached to them.  
Forms of events, like festivals and sport competitions, are expected to conform to widely held  
expectations regarding where and when they are held, who attends, accepted and expected  
behaviours, and even their programmic elements. Going beyond the norms, as innovative event  
designers do, risks alienating or at least mystifying elements of the potential audience. If the  
changes are accepted, perhaps over a long period of time, then they are added to the social  
constructs we hold. We can call this process the making of tradition, or the establishment of  
social norms and conformity.  
Social and political constructs  
Many cities and countries have used mega events to gain legitimacy and prestige, draw atten-  
tion to their accomplishments, foster trade and tourism, or help open their countries to global  
influences. This is much more than place marketing – it is more like national identity-building.  
Whitson and Macintosh \(1996, 279\) argued that countries and cities compete for mega-sport  
events to demonstrate their strengths and modernity. Julie Russell \(2004\) examined the politi-  
cal meanings attached to the National Eisteddfod of Wales, which has a tradition dating back to  
1176\. She found that this annual competition of music and poetry is simultaneously an arena  
for performing arts, a forum for preserving the Welsh language, a tourist attraction, a trade  
fair, and a platform for political acts of Welsh significance. Derrett \(2004, 48\) discussed how  
communities share their culture through festivals and events, and how the interdependencies  
of residents, place, and visitors help establish a valued sense of community and place. The envi-  
ronments are inclusive, and safe and embody communally agreed-upon values and aspirations.  
*Cultural Meanings*  
Quinn \(2000, 264\) concluded that\:  
If at the heart of every festival are a place and a place-based community actively  
reproducing its shared values and belief systems, there is an important sense in which  
these cultural meanings are intentionally produced to be read by the outside world.  
A related challenge stems from the fact that meanings are easily and often contested, based on  
different values and belief systems within the same community. So, while the festival is a text  
on culture, it is often an ambiguous one.  
Sport as cultural expreSSion  
“Games and sports, like religious rituals and festivals, can be interpreted as reflections of broader social  
relationships and cultural ideals” \(Mitler et al., 2004, 348\). To Geertz \(1993\) they were models 90  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
of culture depicting key values and ideals, such as fair play or friendly competition. Sport can  
also have more sinister or controversial significance, reflecting or encouraging aggression and  
dominance of one group over another, or territoriality and cultural imperialism. Many people  
see elements of a national culture in their sports, and in the emphasis they place on sports. We  
should be asking, does policy regarding sport reflect or shape culture?  
Authentic experiences  
There has been a great deal of debate about what an authentic experience or event really is, and  
if it is even desired or understood by tourists or event-goers. We are speaking here of cul-  
tural authenticity, which is really the cultural meaning attached to an event. Boorstin’s famous  
\(1961\) description of ‘pseudo events’ was really a commentary on mass tourism, as he believed  
that culture was being commoditised and that many events were created to cater to tourists’  
expectations. This belief contrasts with those of MacCannell \(1973\) and others, who believed  
that people sought out authentic cultural experiences because they lived shallow or uninter-  
esting lives. Cohen \(1979\) argued that different types of tourists require different experiences,  
which hold different meanings, all of which are mediated by culture. He distinguished two  
major streams – those searching for authenticity \(or on a spiritual quest\) called ‘modern pilgrim-  
age’, and those seeking pleasure.  
Wang \(1999\) identified four types of approaches to authenticity. ‘Object-related authenticity’ per-  
tains to the true nature of the event as a cultural expression. In this context, event producers  
have to ensure that their performances, design features, and other programmic elements are  
genuine reflections of the culture being displayed. But who is to judge this? ‘Constructive authen-  
ticity’ is projected onto the event in terms of images, expectations, preferences, and beliefs,  
meaning it is a social construction rather than an inherent attribute. Visitors might be fooled,  
and they might not care if the event is not a true cultural expression. Event producers have  
considerable scope for entertaining people, but should they be concerned about the meanings  
attached by visitors? Does the event producer have an obligation \(moral, or in terms of market-  
ing\) to ensure that the event is not misperceived?  
To Wang, ‘existential authenticity’ occurs because whatever the nature of the event \(authentic in  
cultural terms, or not\), event consumers might have their own, meaningful experiences which  
they interpret as being authentic. The theory is that authentic experiences enable the discovery  
of one’s true self. This presents a real challenge for the event producers, as they must acknowl-  
edge that their programme is \(merely?\) a setting or background for desired, highly individ-  
ualised experiences. In a variation, Timothy and Boyd \(2006\) discussed ‘relative authenticity’,  
saying that authenticity is a subjective notion varying from person to person, depending on our  
social conditioning. Meaning is not derived from the event, in this interpretation, but from the  
interaction of event and visitor-created meanings.  
Brooks and Soulard \(2022\) said existential authenticity “...can be understood as individual perfor-  
mances as part of the wider social performances of authentication because individuals regroup themselves  
with others into communities that shares the same belief about an experience they perceive as authentic”  
. In  
this way, authenticity is a collective endeavour. ‘Postmodern authenticity’, said Wang, involves the  
justification of the contrived or imitation. Therefore, according to Rickly \(2022\), it is associ-  
ated with cynicism. This involves the justification of staged authenticity as a substitute for the  
real thing for the purpose of either protecting something sensitive, such as a community or tra-  
dition, or enhancing visitor experiences. Fantasy, simulations, and various uses of technology  
might add to perceived authenticity and enjoyment. Event eXPeriences and Meanings 91  
Rickly’s \(2022\) comprehensive review of the concept from a tourism perspective covered recent  
theoretical additions to the authenticity literature. A phenomenological approach has attracted  
some researchers to attempt to extend the existential approach. More relevant to Event Studies  
is the performative approach which has particular relevance to studies of audience participation  
and storytelling. Lastly, Rickly \(2022\) discussed a small and recent approach called ‘psychoana-  
lytic’ which incorporates consideration of self-identity and alienation. In this view, authenticity  
is a fantasy that cannot be realised, but nevertheless motivates people.  
Brooks and Soulard \(2022\) spoke of ‘cool authentication’  
. It is “typically an explicit, formal, or official  
act that declares something to be authentic” and that fact makes it open to controversy and possibly  
the need for negotiation. “Hot authentication, on the other hand, is informal, collective and iterative”  
.  
In this light, the researchers studied the Burning Man Festival during the pandemic when it  
had been officially cancelled but many people showed up anyway.  
He, Ma, and Zhang \(2023\) reviewed the literature on authenticity, concentrating on tourism,  
event, and brand authenticity. Their research specifically examined the perceived authenticity  
of event brands, with regard to consistency, uniqueness, and integrity. Their findings suggest  
that perceptions affect travel intentions, with event image being a mediating factor.  
The conclusion we are left with is that authenticity is a theoretically difficult concept. Our  
position is that when it comes to determining what is authentic or not, only the cultural groups  
being represented, or doing the performance, are qualified to judge. Within cultures there often  
rages a debate about whether modern performances are authentic and justifiable, which also  
raises the issue of power and how it can be used to put a label on an object or event as being  
authentic or inauthentic. From the consumer’s perspective, perceived authenticity and a posi-  
tive image can be important in motivating travel to events.  
Contested culture, stakeholders, and legitimacy  
Will all stakeholders in a community agree on core values and what is to be celebrated? In fact,  
culture and its representations are often contested. To examine this issue, Crespi-­ Vallbona and  
Richards \(2007\) interviewed many stakeholders in Catalonia, finding that there were common  
issues surrounding festivals in that region. Cultural identity was the strongest and most com-  
mon theme, reflecting this region’s long struggle to establish a national identity. This was a  
binding factor, even though differences in meanings were evident. Nevertheless, the research-  
ers observed a tension between the local and global perspectives on events, and there was  
concern for preserving cultural integrity when events were also expected to serve political,  
economic, and social goals. They observed that “...stakeholders tend to differ more in the meanings  
attached to concepts such as identity, with policy makers exhibiting a greater emphasis on economic and polit-  
ical issues, whereas cultural producers are more concerned with social aspects of identity” \(Crespi-Vallbona  
and Richards, 2007, 103\).  
*Economic Meanings*  
To a large extent, the economic meanings attached to events relate to event tourism and the  
roles of attraction, catalyst, animator, image-maker, and place marketer \(see Chapter 15\).  
These meanings are shaped by politicians and industry, rather than the general public or trav-  
ellers themselves. Many events are also considered to be part of the entertainment or cul-  
ture industries, or perhaps the creative industries, and these represent economic meanings.  
Although many events are within the realm of arts and culture, they do have to be managed 92  
Event eXPeriences and Meanings  
as businesses. This introduces a tension between the values of arts/culture on the one hand  
and the potential for hard-nosed management or commercialisation on the other. Ideally, the  
economic and arts/cultural meanings can be brought into balance.  
Sports as big business is a recurring theme. For example, Rozin \(2000\) described Indianapolis  
as a ‘classic case’ of how sports can generate a civic turnaround. Sports Business Market Research  
Inc. \(2000, 167\) observed that in the 1980s and 1990s American cities “put heavy emphasis on  
sports, entertainment and tourism as a source of revenue for the cities”  
. Gratton and Kokolakakis \(1997\)  
believed that in the UK sports events had become the main platform for economic regeneration  
in many cities.  
Within the corporate world, it is now fashionable to think of a brand in terms of relation-  
ships, with ‘live communications’ or ‘event experiences’ building and sustaining these relationships  
between company and customer. In this context, planned events are brand-building tools, and  
the experiences have to be evaluated in terms of how they meet corporate marketing aims.  
There is a growing competition to attract and engage customers this way, so events will tend to  
have a short life cycle. Something new will always be needed.  
When companies practice corporate responsibility, their participation in events takes on new  
meanings. To the extent that corporations show commitment to the community and the envi-  
ronment out of altruism or necessity, events can be expressions of that commitment. Contem-  
porary consumers and lobby groups expect companies to behave responsibly, and that should  
lead to something of a reversal in the trend towards viewing participation in events as just  
marketing.  
*Enduring Meaning*  
Ryan’s \(2014\) concept of ‘enduring meaning’ is related to a number of variables, such as the  
level of interest or commitment a person or community has in an event. The meaning one  
attaches to an event or event experience might not last, and might not be considered important.  
Moscardo \(2010\) summarised the literature on effective and rewarding customer and tourist  
experiences, and this body of knowledge is easily adaptable to event design and understanding  
of meanings \(see Table 4.1\). Her discussion is in the context of the importance of storytelling  
and themes for tourist experiences. Stories are one form of thematic interpretation. Compare  
Moscardo’s factors to the list of features that help make events special, to the elements of style,  
and discussions of ego involvement and serious leisure. Also, consider which of these reflect  
generic versus targeted benefits. A number of event-specific references have been added by the  
authors.

STUDY GUIDE  
Readers should go through the first section of this chapter, preferably in a group discussion,  
and consider how they experience events of different kinds, and in general how they use the  
term experience. This exercise serves as an introduction to more theoretical views on the nature  
and meaning of human experience, especially leisure and event experiences. Read the theory  
in conjunction with the profiles of foundation disciplines and closely related fields in the later  
chapters of this book. Consider meanings in conjunction with stakeholders and stakeholder  
management, and how each stakeholder might experience events in different ways. There are  
many design implications arising from our discussions of experience – they will be relevant  
again in the design chapter.  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l What are the behavioural \(conative\), emotional \(affective\), and mental \(cognitive\) dimen-  
sions of experience?  
l Why are corporations so interested in event experiences, within the context of the expe-  
rience economy? Consider various corporate events, as well as sponsorship at events, and  
how they attempt to make meaning.  
l Needs and wants, what’s the difference? Do people need events?  
l Describe the model of event experiences; specifically, define ‘liminal’ and ‘liminoid’ in this  
context, drawing on anthropological theory.  
l How do the concepts of ‘optimal arousal’ and ‘flow’ relate to the planned event experience?  
l How would you explain self-actualisation and peak experiences? Any examples from your  
own experiences?  
l Expectation-Confirmation Theory has implications for programme and service quality eval-  
uation. How?  
l In what ways can event experiences be ‘memorable’ and ‘transforming’? Event eXPeriences and Meanings 95  
l Use the concepts of ‘personal construct’ and ‘social construct’ to explain various meanings  
attached to events.  
l Communitas is a concept central to social event experiences. Define it, and give examples of  
how it might be facilitated.  
l What is meant by ‘cultural authenticity’ and why is it important in Event Studies?

# Celebration Events  
# and Experiences  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES  
For each major type of event, be able to explain the following\:  
l The meaning, and various expressions of celebration.  
l Different connotations associated with each event type.  
l How they are studied in the foundation disciplines and within Event Studies.  
l Experiences associated with each type\: festivals, carnivals, commemorations, parades, and  
other forms of cultural celebration.  
l Hallmarks of each type, these being their main delimiting characteristics or elements of style.  
l Issues for planners, managers, and policymakers.  
l Why celebrations can be controversial and their meanings contested.  
# Introduction  
Our purpose in this chapter and the next is to profile each type, including examples, by high-  
lighting their essential characteristics. This refers to both the experiences associated with each  
type, and their hallmark elements of style. Virtual event experiences have already been dis-  
cussed, as have foundation theories and generic models. In this chapter, we focus on the very  
broad category of cultural celebrations, with Chapter 6 concluding the profiling of major event  
types by examining business-related events, sports, and several other types. Chapter 6 also  
includes a section on the experiences of different types of stakeholders, as these are important  
for designers, programmers, and those who provide hospitality.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003374251-5 Celebration Events and eXPeriences 97  
Celebration has several connotations\:  
l A joyful occasion; special festivities to mark some happy event; a joyous diversion; to  
observe a day or event with ceremonies of respect, festivity, or rejoicing \(such as Thanksgiv-  
ing celebrations\).  
l Solemnisation \(the public performance of a sacrament or solemn ceremony with all appro-  
priate rituals, such as to celebrate mass or a marriage\).  
l To extol, praise, or acclaim.  
l To make widely known.  
Synonyms for to celebrate include\: to commemorate, honour, or distinguish.  
Cultural celebrations are solemn or joyous events that have meaning to large populations and to  
sub-cultures. They are separated from entertainment by the cultural values being expressed,  
although the boundaries are not rigid. They are also often contested with regard to values and  
meanings. Consisting of festivals, carnivals, heritage commemorations, parades, and religious  
rites and rituals, the study of cultural celebrations draws heavily from cultural anthropology.  
This is one of the oldest and best-established approaches to Event Studies, focusing on the  
roles and meanings of festivity and celebration in, and across, cultures. The event’s theme  
suggests what is to be celebrated, although in many cases it is the community itself that is  
the object of celebrations. In all cultural events, we should be concerned with the concepts of  
communitas and authenticity, and what they mean in experiential terms.  
Cultural tourism experiences in general are all about seeking knowledge, learning, experiencing  
understanding something new and appreciating some aspects of culture – both the traveller’s  
and that of the destination. The cultural tourist or cultural event-goer wants to engage emo-  
tionally and cognitively with places, people, and dimensions of lifestyle, including tangible  
things like historic sites, cultural performances, food and beverages, or meeting local people,  
and with intangible aspects including the symbolism of art and architecture. Simply sightsee-  
ing, or passively enjoying entertainment or spectacle, does not necessarily constitute a cultural  
experience, although it depends on how the individual perceives it. Celebrations and commem-  
orations in general foster belonging and sharing among a family, social group, community, or  
nation. Values come to the fore, and a clear sense of place is usually present.  
# Festivals  
Although it does not do justice to the richness and diversity of meanings attached to festival, we  
propose the following simple definition\:  
Festivals are themed, public celebrations.  
To elaborate, consider Falassi’s definition. In Time Out of Time\: Essays on the Festival \(1987, 2\),  
the sociologist suggested that festivals were a social phenomenon found in virtually all human  
cultures, and that in modern English the term has several meanings\:  
l A sacred or profane time of celebration, marked by special observances.  
l The annual celebration of a notable person or event, or \(of\) the harvest of an important  
product.  
l A cultural event consisting of a series of performances of works in the fine arts, often  
devoted to a single artist or genre. 98  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
l A fair.  
l Generic gaiety, conviviality, and cheerfulness.  
Falassi \(1987, 2\) argued that in the social sciences, festival means\:  
...a periodically recurrent, social occasion in which, through a multiplicity of forms  
and a series of coordinated events, participate directly or indirectly and to various  
degrees, all members of a whole community, united by ethnic, linguistic, religious,  
historical bonds, and sharing a world-view. Both the social function and the symbolic  
meaning of the festival are closely related to a series of overt values that the community  
recognizes as essential to its ideology and worldview, to its social identity, its historical  
continuity, and to its physical survival, which is ultimately what festivals celebrate.  
The term festival is much overused, and often misused. Some so-called festivals are nothing  
more than commercial promotions or parties. Indeed, festivity is often used in the same way  
as “having a good time”. Many community festivals are celebrations of the host community in  
all its diversity. Jepson and Clarke \(2014, 3\) proposed the following definition for community  
festivals\:  
Themed and inclusive community event or series of events which have been created as  
the result of an inclusive community planning process to celebrate the particular way  
of life of people and groups in the local community with emphasis on particular space  
and time.  
Festivals should not be simply a public entertainment programme, or a special time for fun  
and activities – the forms of celebration and the meanings should be clearly communicated.  
Many articles on festivals have been assembled on the Routledge Handbook of Festivals \(2019\),  
and in the introduction, Mair emphasised “…festivals hold multifaceted roles in society, spanning eco-  
nomic development, tourism benefits, social outcomes and others” and they are therefore deserving of  
continued and serious research efforts. The handbook explored these key themes\: definitions  
and roles; sustainability; management; marketing; strategic uses; experiences; types; cultural  
perspectives; and futures.  
The reason sociologists and anthropologists have spent so much effort studying festivals is  
that they reveal much about culture and the functioning of societies. Turner \(1982\) recognised  
that people have a need to set aside times and places for celebration where they are co-present.  
Eagleton \(1981\), Hughes \(1999\), and Ravenscroft and Mateucci \(2002\) thought festivals and  
carnivals provide a socially sanctioned forum for unleashing social tensions that would oth-  
erwise prove destructive. Ekman \(1999\), Farber \(1983\), and Geertz \(1993\) saw festivals as  
socially sustaining devices through which people express identities, connect with their place,  
and communicate with the outside world. Manning \(1983, 4\) argued that festivals and parades  
provide a rich ‘text’, the reading of which provides much knowledge about local culture and  
community life. His view on celebration was that it is a performance entailing the “dramatic  
presentation of cultural symbols”. Celebration is also ‘public, with no social exclusion’ and is therefore  
participatory entertainment.  
The festival experience has been studied in depth. Falassi \(1987, 3\) noted\:  
At festival times, people do something they normally do not; they abstain from  
something they normally do; they carry to the extreme behaviours that are usually  
regulated by measure; they invert patterns of daily social life. Reversal, intensification,  
trespassing, and abstinence are the four cardinal points of festive behaviour. Celebration Events and eXPeriences 99  
This description demonstrates a relationship between carnival and festival, but as we examine  
later, carnival has other dimensions. The two forms are sometimes indistinguishable.  
The building blocks of festivals can all be considered ritual acts, or rites since they happen  
within an exceptional frame of time and space, and their meaning is considered to go beyond  
their literal and specific aspects. Falassi \(1987, 4\) expressed it this way\:  
The framing ritual that opens the festival is one of valorization \(which for religious  
events has been called sacralization\) that modifies the usual and daily function and  
meaning of time and space. To serve as the theatre of the festive events an area  
is reclaimed, cleared, delimited, blessed, adorned, forbidden to normal activities.  
Similarly, daily time is modified by a gradual or sudden interruption that introduces  
‘time out of time’, a special temporal dimension devoted to special activities.  
Geographical research on festivals has viewed them as contested spaces where symbolic prac-  
tices \(a parade, for example\) are used to consolidate or resist prevailing norms and values. An  
example is Sydney’s Mardi Gras parade, which reveals “the different ways bodies, emotions, sexu-  
ality and spatiality become entwined within the annual rhythms of this mega-event” \(Waitt and Stapel,  
2011, 197\). As Hall and Page \(2012\) argued, “this \[contestation\] is especially the case in geograph-  
ical settings where events characterise the out-of-home forms of leisure \(as opposed to the in-home forms  
except for where they are televised and consumed within the home\). What characterises the event and its  
significance is the way it transforms everyday living and also serves as a means to reinterpret and represent  
locality and identity”. In the case of festivals, Waterman \(1998, 56\) succinctly conveyed these  
points, arguing that\:  
...A conventional approach to festivals in human geography in which the arts festival  
was little more than a transient cultural event with a measurable impact on the  
landscape, environment and economy might simply have been mapped or modelled  
. . . But festivals are cultural artefacts which are not simply bought and consumed  
but which are also accorded meaning through their active incorporation into people’s  
lives . . . They epitomise the representation of contemporary accumulation through  
spectacle.  
Waterman \(1998\) highlighted the significant role of place in the spectacle of events and their  
meaning \(Olds and Ley 1988\), building on the work of Jackson \(1988\) who described the  
­ Notting Hill Carnival in London as a vehicle for expression of underlying political tensions. In  
contrast, Richards \(1996\) argued that in the 1970s, festivals were recognised as being catalysts  
for arts development at the local level. Quinn \(2006, 291\) concluded that in Ireland, festivals  
over the previous 35 years expanded venue infrastructure, advanced community animation,  
developed local resources, expanded business in arts and related areas, and developed tourist  
audiences. Festivalisation, discussed earlier, is a term used in reference to the strategic employ-  
ment of festivals in place marketing and tourism promotion, as in the festivalisation of many  
historic cities \(see, for example, Richards, 2007\). Not all observers see this as a positive process.  
Robinson et al. \(2004\) discussed how festivals, supposedly reflecting local and ethnic culture,  
have become part of cultural tourism. However, many are ‘placeless’ and created just for tour-  
ism, giving rise to questions about authenticity and appropriateness. The social meanings of  
festivals in contemporary economic and cultural life are therefore deserving of more attention.  
This discourse has been gaining momentum, as indicated in the books Festivals, Tourism and  
Social Change \(Picard and Robinson, 2006\) and Festival Places\: Revitalising Rural Australia \(Gibson  
and Connell, 2011\). In the Handbook of Festivals \(Mair, 2019\), there is a section devoted to the  
strategic use of festivals and others to experiences and cultural perspectives on festivals. 100  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
More and more so-called festivals are really entertainment productions, so much so that we  
argue that many young people only know festivals as outdoor music concerts. The behaviour  
of attendees is more like carnival, with revelry being the object. There are still festival-like ele-  
ments to the experience, however, as generators of communitas. As well, many festivals have  
been created for their instrumentalist values, such that they are no longer authentic reflections  
of community or culture, but of policy and strategy. O’Sullivan et al. \(2009\) observed that  
in Wales local/community events are driven by socio-cultural and also economic purposes  
when it comes to government involvement. The vast majority are local, and oriented towards  
residents. Economic impact assessments are the dominant form of evaluation, so there is an  
evident mismatch between the stated purpose and the impacts measured.  
*Festival Types*  
Festivals come in many styles, meaning distinctive ways of doing things. Combinations of set-  
ting, programming, theming, and management make each festival production unique in some  
ways, although popular ones often try to replicate their core features while also innovating  
and responding to demand. The British Arts Festivals Association provided a typology\: music,  
dance, visual, theatre, film, comedy, and street arts. It is possible to subdivide these themes.  
Note that they are categorised by artistic content, not by function \(are they tourism-oriented,  
for example, or completely devoted to fostering an art form?\), setting \(indoor theatre versus  
outdoors, free or ticketed\), or programme \(e.g., competitive versus invitational\). Other popular  
festival types pertain to science, food and beverages, literature, and arts for children and the  
family. Festivals with heritage and religious themes are widespread. Community festivals are very  
popular \(see Jepson and Clarke, 2014, for examples\), combining many elements of celebration,  
entertainment, spectacle, and sports, often becoming hallmark events and tourist attractions.  
Referring to a festival’s explicit theme is therefore not always the best indicator of its meaning.  
A search of the Internet will also reveal unusual festivals, such as Dubai’s Shopping Festival,  
again raising the question of what is being celebrated – consumerism?  
Music festivals  
It can be difficult to separate a music festival from a concert, concert series, or other forms  
of entertainment. Do the events have a theme that incorporates cultural celebration, or is  
the experience merely entertaining? Many events that call themselves a festival do not meet  
all the criteria, but remain very popular and embody some of the same elements of style and  
facilitate similar experiences. It also has to be noted that there is a very wide range of musical  
genres, settings \(indoor and out\), and formats \(e.g., ticked, free, and open\) that differentiate  
music events. Older consumers might prefer classical music in a theatre, younger consumers  
a weekend of tenting, outdoor concerts, and revelry. All this means that design and marketing  
implications are considerable.  
Pegg and Patterson \(2010\) examined visitor motivations and experiences sought at music  
festivals. They found that visitors’ love of country music was the primary reason for attend-  
ing the festival. However, the overall results indicated that it was the variety of activities and  
festival atmosphere that were considered by visitors as being the most important aspects of  
their participation. The atmosphere was repeatedly mentioned as a reoccurring theme, and, in  
particular, they stressed the casual, relaxed, family friendly atmosphere. Visitors also com-  
mented on the welcoming feelings that they received from people who were living locally.  
This reflects a sense that the event attracted people with a desire to have a safe and enjoyable  
time together. Celebration Events and eXPeriences 101  
Further insights are provided by Ballantyne et al. \(2014\) in their analysis of the music festival  
experience. In contrast to the Tamworth \(Australia\) festival mentioned above by Pegg and Pat-  
terson \(2010\), consider this radically different experience described by an anonymous blogger  
who attended a drugs-infested concert\:  
Take how many times you have been offered drugs and multiply that times 1,000 and  
that’s how many times you will be offered drugs a day at. . . . People walking around  
with backpacks shouting ‘coke, x, molly, nugs, doses!’ and every other drug you can  
think of. I walked by a table where people were selling nitrus in balloons. What I learned  
throughout this was that the people who are carrying around all of these drugs were  
there to screw you over and take your money. There is a system with the . . . drug world  
its either bring your own or make friends with hippies because they have the best stuff.  
We were exchanging food and beer for getting smoked up and acid.  
Pop music festivals  
Stone \(2008\) identified the origins of the modern era of outdoor pop music festivals, beginning  
in the USA in the 1960s with Monterey \(1967\) and Woodstock \(1969\), and discussed the  
underlying political issues. In Britain, the earliest were the 1968–1970 Isle of Wight festivals  
and Glastonbury \(1970\). The numbers were growing each year in the UK, but the pandemic  
might have changed that trend. Stone defined pop music festivals as recurring performance  
events with two or more live performances over one or more days, and packaged as a coherent  
whole. Some are indoors, and some are even free. ‘Pop’ covers all popular musical genres. They  
can be competitive \(e.g., battle of the bands\), for-profit or for charities, single or multi-venue.  
The programme might include traditional festive elements like comedy and theatre, dance, and  
merchandising. Summer is the dominant festival season, and success often depends upon good  
weather. Stone asserts that the audience has been growing and widening, it’s not just young  
people or ageing hippies. And they are increasingly expensive entertainment options. Those  
who identify with sub-cultures and counter-cultures are unhappy with the increasing cost, commer-  
cialism, professionalism, and regulations imposed by governments.  
Stone \(2008, 223\) argued that\: “Uniquely, many festivals serve as adult playgrounds, representing mar-  
ginal, liminal zones devoted to hedonism and largely uninhibited play and fun”. People are also moti-  
vated to attend by the need for identity-building and affirmation, linked to the accumulation of  
‘popular culture capital’. In other words, it’s the thing to do. Stone \(2008\) listed recent trends in  
the form and themes of pop music festivals \(also see Jones, 2015 on their historical evolution  
since the 1960s\). Their growth is a reflection of cultural diversity, targeted live communica-  
tions, and the power of social media to attract audiences. The identified categories include  
those with religious themes, and locations that are urban or in holiday destinations. Stone  
described others with these terms\: premium, secret, teen’s, deliberately constrained, boutique,  
women’s, green, family, dual-location, economy, political, no-camping, and virtual festivals.  
uk music festivals – scale and impact  
In 2013, UK Music produced the report Music Tourism\: Contribution to the UK Economy, in which  
it outlined the impact of the music tourism industry on the UK. Music festivals played a major  
role in this industry, where\:  
l Music tourism contributed £ 2.2 billion to the UK economy in 2012.  
l £1.3 billion was spent by music tourists, of which £ 6.5 million was from overseas tourists  
visiting the UK. 102  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
l 41% of the market for music tourism was based around live events.  
l Music visitors attended a diversity of music venues such as arenas, festivals, and live perfor-  
mances in parks and stadia; London alone had 349 live music venues.  
In its update in 2022, UK Music emphasised the hard impact of the pandemic\:  
22.09.2022\: UK Music, the collective voice of the UK music industry, publishes  
its This Is Music 2022 annual report today, which reveals how the sector began to  
recover from the initial impact of the pandemic. Unveiling the report, UK Music  
Chief Executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin said the economic findings showed why the  
Government should act to support the music industry, which still faces a “major  
threat from strong economic headwinds”.  
The key findings in This Is Music – based on data collated from across the music industry in  
2021 – include\:  
l UK music industry’s contribution to the UK economy in 2021 was £4 billion – up 26% on  
the £3.1 billion figure for 2020, but still down 31% on the pre-Covid all-time high of £5.8  
billion in 2019  
l Employment in the music industry rose to 145,000 jobs in 2021 – up 14% on the 128,000  
jobs in 2020, but still down 26% on the pre-Covid record of 197,000 jobs in 2019  
l Exports in the sector rose in 2021 to £2.5 billion – up 10% on the £2.3 billion figure in 2020,  
but still down 15% on the £2.9 billion in 2019.  
In 2021, live venues spent a significant amount of the year closed, or operating at limited  
capacity, and this was a global phenomenon that extended well into 2022. Employment in the  
UK sector fell by 35% compared to 2019. \(Source\: https\://www.ukmusic.org/news/uk-music-  
urges-government-to-protect-music-industry-from-economic-storm-as-new-report-reveals-  
sectors-fragile-recovery/\)  
Counter-cultures  
Goffman \(1959, 33\) said counter-cultures are “...transgressive, avant-guard movements, embracing...  
change and experimentation....” To a certain extent, this applies to many music festivals aimed at  
a younger population \(and those who grew up with them\). Wright \(2021\) wrote about coun-  
terculture and music festivals. He argued that modernisation has resulted in standardisation  
of culture, making it more and more difficult to actually find and belong to a counterculture.  
Globalization and social networks are establishing a world in which larger numbers  
of individuals can be part of a range of \(alternative\) cultures. Unlike the past, fully  
immersing oneself into a counterculture today is difficult. What is more likely to  
develop are opportunities for people to pick and choose cultural experiences.  
Using market research and big data \(i.e., huge data sets often obtained from social-network  
platforms and various apps\) corporations attempt to co-op identifiable sub and counter-cultures  
into good consumers. Counterculture movements tend to become mainstream. Wright  
described the steps\: 1\: counterculture movement; 2\: increased social exposure; 3\: capital com-  
modity \(i.e., commercial interests exploit the movement\); 4\: wider audience engagement; and  
finally, 5\: mainstream standardised cultural commodity.  
Duffy and Mair \(2018, 25\) argued that “Festivals are fundamentally about encounter in its broad-  
est sense; these are events and periods of time in which people meet and interact”. Those produced by Celebration Events and eXPeriences 103  
governments and not-for-profits are often free, easy to access, and intended to be inclusive. In  
the modern world, however, “...tensions can arise because of perceived or real fears about crime, violence  
and terrorism; racial intolerance; uncertainty; and insecurity, such that some groups feel uncomfortable and  
excluded from public space”. Flinn and Frew \(2014\) explored the interconnections between the  
experiential dimension of Glastonbury music festival, mystical and fantasy narratives, and the  
political contestation of festivity, focusing on the narratives created through multi- and social  
media. Their analysis was underpinned by the theoretical developments around experience and  
the experience economy.  
PROFILE 5.1  
Illuminate Adelaide, by Steve Brown  
Steve Brown is a practitioner academic who has combined professional practice as  
an event designer with academic research, primarily in the fields of event design  
and audience behaviour. As well as designing and successfully managing a broad  
range of events across Australia, he was responsible for the development of the  
event design and management programs at Flinders University in Adelaide, Aus-  
tralia. He was a board member of the Adelaide Fringe *\(https\://adelaidefringe.com.*  
*au\)*, 1978–1982, a staff member of, or consultant for the Adelaide Festival *\(https\://*  
*www.adelaidefestival.com.au\)* *from 1975 to 2019 and a board member 2012–15,*  
*a consultant for Womadelaide \(https\://www.womadelaide.com.au\) from 1991 to*  
*2018, and a committee member of the South Australia Events Steering Committee*  
*1994–95.*  
Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, is the fifth most populated city in Australia  
\(1.4 million\) and has had an international reputation for festivals and the arts beginning  
in the 1960s when the Adelaide Festival of Arts was established and then the establish-  
ment of the Adelaide Fringe and, over time, a broad range of other festivals and events  
including sports, horse, and latterly, motor racing.  
Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate and is blessed with mild weather most of the  
year, and perfect event and festival conditions through the month of October \(Spring,  
12C min., 22C max., six rain days\), the hotter summer months \(17C min., 29C max., two  
rain days\), to April \(Autumn, 13C min., 23C max., six rain days\). This climate, combined  
with the simple, square mile layout of the city centre on one level surrounded on each  
side by broad areas of park lands, makes it the ideal festival and event city, something  
recognised in its vehicle number plate slogan ‘The Festival State’. The introduction of  
Daylight Saving in 1971 ensures that evenings are in twilight conditions well past 8 pm,  
also contributing to the festival ‘vibe’ of the city.  
Given the predilection for school and business holidays to be taken over the summer  
months, there is a conglomeration of large-scale outdoor events that are staged in  
the month of March each year including the Festival, Fringe, womadelaide, and the  
Adelaide Cup horse race – all contributing to the month being labelled \(positively\) as  
‘Mad March’ in Adelaide.  
While the summer months – and especially March – provided viable tourist attrac-  
tions and ensured there were high occupancy rates in the city and inner suburb 104  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
accommodation and significant economic returns for the events and festivals staged,  
the winter months remained of concern. In 1994, the then Minister for Tourism, the  
Hon. Jane Lomax-Smith \(now the current Lord Mayor\), established a tourism roundta-  
ble and the Event Steering Committee specifically to find ways of developing events  
and festivals over the less well-patronised winter months. While indoor conferences  
were actively pursued for and by the recently developed \(1987\) Adelaide Conven-  
tion Centre \(https\://www.adelaidecc.com.au\), there was an opportunity for a more  
broadly based winter events calendar. The Adelaide Cabaret Festival was established  
in 2001 and continues to grow but is somewhat restricted by the number of suitable  
and available indoor venues. What event could be indoor and outdoor, work in the  
winter months, attract a broad cross-section of the population and attract audiences  
large enough to rival those of Mad March? Enter *Illuminate Adelaide* onto the South  
Australian event calendar. \(https\://www.illuminateadelaide.com\)  
This curated event was designed to capture future technologies, develop a new, inno-  
vative performance language through the commission of new work, was interactive and  
accessible to a broad audience, was unique to South Australia and on a scale to equal  
Adelaide’s summer festival-heavy ‘Mad March’ – all while being commercially viable.  
Conceived in 2019 by Co-Founders and Creative Directors, Rachael Azzopardi and Lee  
Cumberlidge, the event was successful in attracting initial government support and  
finally launched in 2021 – right in the middle of a global pandemic.  
The inaugural event in 2021 had many challenges, with a seven-day lockdown falling  
right in the middle of the festival. All indoor events were cancelled \(35,000 tickets\)  
and density requirements at outdoor events were severely reduced. The design was  
modified at the free outdoor events and viewing times \(how long between each perfor-  
mance, and how long the audience stayed in one place\) were monitored and distancing  
was achieved, but the focus remained on the audience experience. Regardless of the  
practical limitations, the experience was paramount, so new and creative ways of work-  
ing within restrictions to deliver the experiences became the new normal. Rapid transi-  
tion from revised concept to delivery was achieved in an environment where creatives  
and staff were working remotely or in restricted numbers and where travel restrictions  
meant less personnel travelling. Rather than a limitation, this led to creative teams that  
were leaner and more agile. Moment Factory, as one example, used the restrictions to  
develop a test case of how to work creatively from a distance.  
The research and scholarship into events and festivals have been successful in con-  
vincing many in the industry that while the foundation of any successful event is strong  
event *management*, it is well-researched and effectively applied event *design* that is  
the critical factor in the success and sustainability of an event. There was some trepida-  
tion that due to the impact of the global pandemic, there may have been a return to  
the previous event management predominant paradigm.  
While audience density, social distancing, flow rate requirements, testing regimes, PPE,  
hygiene facilities, and learning to pivot in response to a rapidly changing legislative  
environment certainly fall within that management paradigm, it was encouraging to  
find – even in a time of lockdowns and cancellations – that design was still a major  
consideration for many events, including Illuminate Adelaide. Celebration Events and eXPeriences 105

Illuminate Adelaide now is one of South Australia’s and one of Australia’s largest major  
winter events, with over 400 artists, more than a million attendances, and almost \$45  
million generated in economic activity \(2022\).  
By putting their audience first, regardless of the practical and management challenges  
that confronted them, Illuminate Adelaide successfully designed and staged an event  
that captured and engaged their audience in a meaningful way. In less complex times,  
the festival continues to grow and develop to meet each of its objectives – creative and  
commercial – and that is the promise of an event design approach.

# Carnivals and Mardi Gras  
Carnival is a celebration preceding Lent and is associated with feasting, costumes, parades, and  
revelry. Mardi Gras \(translated as Fat Tuesday\) is the last day of the carnival season. People go  
to carnivals and Mardi Gras events for fun, play, and revelry \(even debauchery\), enhanced or 106  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
manifested through role reversal in masquerading, parades, and costume balls. People love to  
dress up \(or down, witness Zombie parades and PRIDE costumes\), have a party, and suspend  
the social norms and even laws that govern everyday life.  
Turner \(1974\) and other anthropologists and sociologists have paid considerable attention to  
carnivals, often distinguishing between the sacred elements of traditional, religiously grounded  
festivals, and the profane side of carnivals. Carnival remains a popular subject for academic  
researchers, including books by Riggio \(2004\) on carnivals in Trinidad, and by Harris \(2003\) on  
folk theology and performance associated with carnivals. Nurse \(2004\) reported on the Trini-  
dad Carnival from the points of view of tourism and the cultural industry. To some, the carnival  
is a sanctioned form of mild civil disobedience, to others it is something to forbid or repress.  
Ritual, festivity, revelry, and ecstasy perform a variety of roles, some say as safety valves, and  
might actually counter depression and lead to social health.  
In Europe, carnival remains a strong tradition in many countries, especially where Roman Cath-  
olic populations are large, and the Federation of European Carnival Cities \(https\://carnivalcities.  
net/\) is the related professional association. According to FECC, there are at least nine types of  
European carnival, among them the Samba or Caribbean form that is popular in the New World,  
including Rio de Janeiro. Carnivals have a very long history. They can have distinctive styles but  
tend to feature masquerade or costume balls, parades, theatrical productions, feasting, and par-  
tying. From the Carnival of Venice website \(www.carnivalofvenice.com\) comes this reminder\:  
The Carnival in Venice is no ‘goof’, no ‘consumerist ceremony’ as some people com-  
plain, but sincere, wonderful heartfelt tradition that goes back in time almost a mil-  
lennium, and despite its age, still shows its vitality to whom participates to it in  
person or in spirit.  
Carnival in Venice is believed to have become official in 1296, lasted six weeks or  
longer, and built on an already established tradition of mask wearing. By the 18th  
Century it was a famous event embodying balls, spectacles, masks and theatre.  
\(For the detailed programme visit the official website www.carnevale.venezia.it\)  
Carnival in Venice has been innovating, as evidenced in this 2023 website proclamation\:

digital skins or impress everyone with Colombina’s and Original Sign’s digital masks.  
Whatever you decide, take your mark of uniqueness into the Metaverse.  
In cold climates, winter carnivals are flourishing, such as Quebec’s Winter Carnival, which has  
become the city’s hallmark event. Midsumma Carnival in Melbourne, Australia, is an exam-  
ple of the numerous gay and lesbian Mardi Gras or carnivals held around the world, many of  
which have become major tourist attractions \(Pitts, 1999\). As the following quote from the  
Midsumma website explains\:  
Carnival transforms Treasury Gardens into the queerest park in Australia. Carnival  
is wearing her brand new Treasury frock so come and tell her she’s beautiful and  
experience a spectacular hub of queer games, hot music, bump-your-booty dancing  
and sporting prowess as we celebrate the closing of Midsumma.  
\(www.midsumma.org.au\)  
According to Ehrenreich \(2006\), ‘collective ecstasy’, a part of carnival and akin to dancing in  
the streets, has been a part of human civilisation from the very beginning. There is an age-old Celebration Events and eXPeriences 107  
conflict between control exerted by social hierarchies and the desire for freedom of expres-  
sion and behaviour. Religion and politics conspire to suppress natural tendencies. Ehrenreich  
pointed to the carnivalisation of sports and said that protest movements constantly reinvent  
the carnival. Turner’s notion of communitas in The Ritual Process \(1969\) and Durkheim’s  
\(1912\) notion of ‘collective effervescence’ are related concepts. To Bakhtin \(1993\), the carni-  
val was something people create for themselves \(i.e., it is a liberating force\) in contrast to  
the spectacles that those in power prefer. Debord \(1983\), in Society of the Spectacle, argued  
that spectacle is associated with power and control, while carnival or festivity fosters inclu-  
siveness. Gotham \(2005a\), in a review of urban spectacles associated with carnivals, high-  
lighted the conflict and struggles over the meaning of such celebrations, while Addo’s \(2009\)  
anthropological review examined the way in which spectacle had become ritualised by festi-  
val practices.  
Laing and Frost \(2014\) examined how “traditional events and the identities they support are increas-  
ingly being challenged and rituals may be lost”. Reacting against the homogenising effects of glo-  
balisation, many communities and events are recreating or inventing rituals, sometimes  
borrowing from others, in the pursuit of uniqueness and authenticity. Mardi Gras in New  
Orleans was one of the events examined in this context, and that event has been studied by  
many authors. For example, Gotham \(2005a, 2005b\) argued that this event demonstrates the  
forces of both globalisation \(manifested in commodification\) as it is an international tourist  
attraction, and localisation \(wherein residents and groups create new traditions and reinforce  
a sense of place\).  
Godet \(2020, 2\) commented on festivity and carnival in the context of the Covid pandemic. “As  
we write, communities around the world are finding new ways of celebrating together without large physical  
gatherings, creating fresh forms of festive social interactions”.  
Articles in a 2020 issue of the online journal Festivity dealt with a number of related topics,  
including the fact that festivity can be both unifying and divisive, and therefore politicised.  
Godet also emphasised that the study of the carnival as an event form is different from the  
“carnivalesque which has been used to characterize all sorts of collective activities that use symbolic inversion  
for expressive purposes and in which the negation of the established order provides a temporary opening for  
alternative, hybrid identifications to flourish”.  
Some authors have pointed to carnivalesque behaviour at sporting events and other assem-  
blies, including at protests, giving rise to the term ‘protestival’ \(see Lamond and Spracklen,  
2015\). Developing this theme, Godet said \(p. 9\) that carnival “...enables people to viscerally feel  
that they belong to a distinct social and political entity and may thus become a vehicle whereby citizens find  
voice against the state or race- and class-based social divisions. If not outright subversion, then, carnival  
offers the possibility of creating a space for renegotiating and even resisting hegemony”.  
# Heritage Commemorations  
These are memorial services, specific ceremonies or broader events \(even festivals\) designed to  
honour the memory of someone or something. Most commonly they are marked in the context  
of national days, birthdays of kings and queens, battles, or wars. Remembrance Days or Veter-  
ans Days fall into this category. Programmes must include something symbolic and interpretive  
about the events or persons being remembered. Frost and Laing \(2013\), in the book Commem-  
orative Events\: Memories, Identities, Conflicts, emphasised that they are all about remembering  
and are held on the anniversaries of significant past events, either annually or after significant  
time periods. Such events provide a fascinating insight into how societies see themselves, their  
heritage, and their identity. These events, however, carry a high propensity for controversy, as 108  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
memory and identity are highly subjective. As well, stakeholders often hold different views on  
what should be commemorated, and why.  
Heritage is open to interpretation, often being a politically charged term. It means more than  
historic and implies a value judgement as to what is important. McCarthy \(2012\) examined  
the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin \(also see Grayson and McGarry, 2016\) – which sparked off a  
series of events culminating in 1922 with the creation of the Irish Free State – and traces the  
historiography \(being the study of how history is researched and written\) of the celebration of  
the event that challenged the British government while it was fighting the Great War. Frost et  
al. \(2008\) considered the contested meanings associated with many commemorations, as multiple  
stakeholders ensure that they often become political in nature.  
# Parades and Processions  
The expression “everyone loves a parade” seems to be a universal and age-old truth. Parades  
are usually an organised, celebratory procession of people, and the most popular ones are  
mobile spectacles of entertainment and celebration. As a planned event, parades and other  
processions are unique in that the entertainment, or other objects of the spectator’s gaze, go  
past the audience in a dynamic progression. City streets are often the stage, and reclaiming  
them from vehicular traffic is part of the pleasure of viewing parades. They can be events all  
on their own, or part of broader festivals and sport celebrations. The experience should be  
one of joy and wonder \(especially for children\), merriment, socialising on a big scale, and an  
appreciation of the arts, skills, symbols, and heritage objects on display. There are a number  
of important variations, including flotillas \(of boats\), cavalcades \(of horses\), religious proces-  
sions \(often with objects of reverence\), and military marches including weapons of warfare.  
Some parades consist of just people, but frequent elements include floats, marching bands,  
entertainment units \(like dancers or flag-wavers\), and important people \(the parade marshal,  
beauty queens\).  
From a sociological perspective, Tomlinson \(1986\) found small-town parades to be full of  
imagery and symbolism reflecting community values like purity, beauty, humour, religion, and  
politics. Parades are performances for both residents and outsiders. Other examples of schol-  
arship related to parades include the book Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade by Grippo \(2004\) and  
Darian-Smith’s \(2011\) history of agricultural shows and festivals in rural Australia and their  
inclusion of parades. Pojani \(2014\) examined the use of public space in Tirana, the capital of  
Albania, through different political transformations and how events and processions link to  
urban design, power, and ideology. In contrast, Olson \(2017\) undertook a content analysis of  
the 780 pride events held in the USA and Canada that celebrate sexual diversity.  
# Religious Events and Pilgrimage  
Festivals and other celebrations often include religious ceremonies, but primarily religious  
events embody solemn rites and rituals, and are considered to be sacred within the context of  
specific religions. Some, like Mexico’s Day of the Dead, have become national holidays \(literally,  
holy days\). The Japanese matsuri is a type of religious event, generally community-based, pro-  
duced by volunteers and celebrating a variety of religious or spiritual themes. Saint Patrick’s  
Day, celebrating the Feast of Saint Patrick, is a religious celebration that has become a major  
celebration throughout the Irish diaspora. The event has a long history \(Cronin and Adair,  
2004\), with the annual New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade dating back to 1762. Celebration Events and eXPeriences 109  
Pilgrimage is a journey for religious or spiritual purposes. It reinforces collective religious and cul-  
tural values and generally focuses on places and events of significance. Shackley \(2001, 102\) called  
pilgrimages ‘linear events’, in which the journey might be as important as the destination in terms of  
visitor motivations and experiences. Pilgrimage is a quest, a journey, and the experience of a sacred  
place. For many, it is a duty. Shinde, K. \(2010\) noted that pilgrimage sites are repositories of reli-  
gious culture and traditions. For example, at the Holi festival in India, there is a hierarchy of spaces  
devoted to rites and rituals, patronage relationships, and public gatherings. The entire pilgrimage  
can be conceptualised as a special event in a person’s life, a rite of passage, and a transforming expe-  
rience, but there are often well-defined events associated with religious pilgrimages. The largest  
events are the Hajj in Mecca, attracting millions of visitors annually \(the Saudi Arabian government  
imposes limits\), and Kumbha Mela \(mela means sacred-site festival\) in India which is held four  
times every 12 years and is said to attract over 28 million pilgrims in 2001 \(Singh, 2006, 228\).  
The term secular pilgrimage \(Collins-Kreiner, 2010\) applies to journeys for non-religious pur-  
poses to places and events that hold special meaning to individuals and groups, such as a sport  
fan’s visit to a particular arena or a hall of fame. Celebrity and fame often motivate such trips.  
The term is also sometimes used metaphorically, as in a person’s mental or emotional pilgrim-  
age, and this refers to a process of seeking and evolving. Spiritual enlightenment is another  
possible motivator and benefit, related to personal development \(Cusack and Digance 2009\).  
*Religious and Spiritual Experiences*  
Sacred and spiritual experiences are not necessarily the same. Sacred generally refers to estab-  
lished religious dogma \(e.g., the Holy Scriptures are sacred; communion is a sacred rite\). Spir-  
itual experiences could be non-religious in nature, consisting of feelings of transcendence \(e.g.,  
“I felt completely removed from, even raised above, the worries of daily life”\) or self-discovery  
\(“I was on a different plain of existence where I felt connected to every thing and every one”\).  
Timothy and Olsen \(2006, 271\) argued that there are significant differences between being  
religious and being spiritual. Spiritual refers to personal belief, a search for meaning in one’s  
life, and so any tourist could have a spiritual experience in a sacred place or alongside religious  
pilgrims. Rapture, ecstasy, transcendence, and revelation are terms used in conjunction with  
intense religious or spiritual experiences. Reisinger \(2006\) saw possibilities for spiritual expe-  
riences being incorporated into, or modifying, many common forms of tourism, from nature  
tours to attending farm shows and harvest festivals, food, and wine tastings to spa visits. While  
often associated with visits to sacred places, spiritual experiences are also realised through  
meditation, exploring, and performing rituals. In this sense, the search for meaning in life can  
propel, almost invisibly, many leisure and travel activities.  
Singh \(2006, 232\) argued that Hindu pilgrims “enjoy sacred journeys as an earthly adventure from one  
place to another that entails the combined effects of a spiritual quest and physical hardship”. The key ele-  
ments that make religious quests and experiences different from other spiritual or emotionally  
uplifting experiences are participation in specified rituals or ceremonies that have deep mean-  
ing to the devoted and faithful. The place itself is crucial, but unlike a secular event venue, the  
meaning of sacred places is permanent, traditional, and sanctioned by official religious bodies.  
# Arts and Entertainment  
Almost any activity, sport, artistic display, or event can be viewed as entertainment. Many  
forms of popular culture fit into this category \(generally defined as pertaining to everyday life\) 110  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
including music concerts, award ceremonies, theatre, art exhibitions, and dance shows. The  
activities that are frequently part and parcel of cultural celebrations can certainly be viewed  
as entertaining, but the underlying purpose is different. It has to be emphasised that enter-  
tainment is usually passive, something one experiences for pleasure without the need to think  
about its cultural/historic significance or the values being expressed. In that sense, entertain-  
ment is largely in the realm of hedonistic consumption, not cultural celebration. This explains  
why entertainment is usually thought of as a business, part of a huge industry, and often exists  
outside government policy for the arts and culture.  
Theatre is a very broad category of planned events, encompassing drama, music, and other per-  
formances that are usually scripted and in a staged environment. Principles of theatre are regu-  
larly applied throughout the events world. We will examine theatre studies and types of theatre  
and performance later, but it is necessary here to distinguish between the major forms of art.  
A review of popular culture, tourism, and events was conducted by Lexhagen, Ziakas, and Lund-  
berg \(2022\). Their conceptual model covered both ‘expressive culture practices’ and ‘media-induced  
fan travel’ that lead to heritage-related attractions or destinations and to events. The model  
named film and screen, literature, music, fashion, video games, sport, and recreation. One of  
the topics explored is fandom, with a number of research questions raised pertaining to how  
being a fan \(of sports, movies, or just about anything\) both generates travel motivation and  
new events, contributes to destination image and place marketing, and is closely linked with  
social worlds and online communities of interest.  
*Performing Arts*  
By definition, almost all performances are planned events. There can be spontaneous perfor-  
mances by individuals and groups, such as singing and chanting, but we would normally not  
call these events entertainment. Performing arts traditionally involve musicians, singers, danc-  
ers, or actors, in front of audiences. In what is often called high culture, there is symphony, bal-  
let, opera, and traditional theatre for plays. In popular culture, we can add every form of musical  
concert \(from jazz to new age, pop to hip-hop\), dance \(modern, tap, and jazz\), and alternative  
performances such as busking and illusion \(magic\), and the relationship with events was high-  
lighted earlier in relation to pop music events. Film and television involve entertainment based  
on indirect \(not in-person\) performances. Fashion could be considered part performance \(the  
fashion show\) and part visual art \(see the case studies in Williams, Laing, and Frost, 2014\).  
Other criteria for classifying arts events include\:  
l Professional versus amateur artists.  
l Competitive versus festive.  
l Mixed or single genre \(e.g., just jazz, or many music types\).  
l Single or multicultural.  
l Paid or free performances.  
l Regularly scheduled, periodic, or one-time.  
l Temporary \(i.e., visual art created with a limited life expectancy, or a one-time-only perfor-  
mance\) versus permanent.  
Festivals and music concerts provide many people with their only performing arts experiences.  
DiMaggio and Mukhtar \(2004\) in reviewing the evidence for declining arts participation in the  
USA referred to increased competition with home forms of entertainment as a plausible reason. Celebration Events and eXPeriences 111  
*Literature*  
Literature consists of the printed word, including books, magazines, and even web logs \(blogs\).  
We only call this art if it is meant to entertain or is written in a style \(like poetry\) that results in  
aesthetic appreciation. Festivals and other planned events that feature poetry or written works  
are common, and these can include readings that are in fact performances. Storytelling festivals  
are a variation, and in this context, Walle \(1994\) studied a Cowboy Poetry Gathering. Hoppen,  
Brown, and Fyall \(2014\) have evaluated literary tourism as a part of destination competitive-  
ness, and it is common for events to be the first and foremost method of implementing this  
form of tourist attractiveness or branding.  
*Visual Arts*  
Painting, sculpture, and handicraft are the most common visual arts, and touring or one-time  
shows or exhibitions of visual arts are planned events. For example, Berryman \(2013\) traced the  
evolution of the public blockbuster exhibition in 1970s Australia as a national event. Installation  
art is a cross between an exhibition and a special event. Architecture is a visual art, and other  
media like computer games and the Internet have become popular for visual artistic expression.  
Any of these art forms can be the theme of planned events. In a contingent valuation study in  
Singapore, Chang and Mahadevan \(2014\) found that a long-running performing arts festival  
was a well-established event, whereas visual arts festivals seem to be more of a fad. Jain \(2016\),  
however, has traced the growth of large arts events in South Asia.  
AI has the potential to revolutionise, or threaten traditional visual arts, given the rise of online  
AI creative sites that allow users to describe what they want to see produced or to modify exist-  
ing pictures. What is at stake is the traditional form of art exhibitions held in galleries – will it  
be replaced by virtual exhibitions?  
*Touring Entertainment\: Circuses, Carnivals, and Other Shows*  
Before the age of mass travel, entertainment had to come to the consumer in the form of trav-  
elling shows. Although these forms of art and entertainment reflect a bygone age, they remain  
popular and continue to evolve. Perhaps the oldest form is the circus \(for history, see Simon,  
2014\), which was popular in the ancient Roman Empire \(including activities that are no longer  
acceptable\) and which has more recently given rise to animal-free entertainment like Cirque  
du Soleil. In a classic study, Easto and Truzzi \(1973\) examined the nature of “carnivals” in the  
USA, “as an entertainment with side shows, rides, games and refreshments, usually operated by a commer-  
cial enterprise”. Easto and Truzzi tracked the historiography of related research, citing reviews  
dating to 1881 and 1932, which clearly differentiated carnivals from circuses.  
Aesthetic judgement concerns art and beauty but is value laden and relative. What one person  
finds attractive, another might describe as boring or disgusting. An aesthetic experience, how-  
ever, is one in which we find something to be pleasing to our senses. It can be the aesthetic  
appreciation of paintings, food, fashion, or music. Hence, it is intensely personal, which leads  
to the expression “you can’t please everyone”. Designers take note\: aesthetic experiences are  
valued, and they motivate a great deal of travel and consumption, but you cannot guarantee  
satisfaction. For most appreciators of fine art, food, music, or whatever, it is the exploration  
and sense of discovery that matters most.  
Limited research has been reported on art exhibitions \(see du Cros and Jolliffe, 2014, for a  
review\). Axelsen and Arcodia \(2004\) argued they should be viewed in the context of special 112  
Celebration Events and eXPeriences  
event motivation and experience. A review of the literature suggested that people attend art  
galleries for reasons of learning, social interaction, status, and novelty.  
Youthful, hard-working consumers, brought up on music videos and computer entertainment,  
seem to have a very limited attention span, and are constantly seeking stimulation. Smith  
\(2006, 224\) concluded that many leisure tourists are not interested in culture, but want play-  
ful, event-fantastical experiences. Contrived, simulated, and even obviously fake settings can  
provide this. Interactivity is desired but in a technological sense. Fascination with celebrities is  
part of this new experiential realm. The industry has responded \(in the spirit of the experience  
economy\) with theming, overtly catering to hedonism, celebrity endorsements, and what has  
been called shoppertainment.  
Award ceremonies\: Many are purely media events, designed primarily for television and/or online  
consumption. Others offer features of festivals, such as selecting the people’s favourite food or  
wine, and sport events \(medal ceremonies\). The hallmark of these events is competition and/  
or recognition of excellence.  
Private events \(functions\)\: Every life is marked by rites de passage, varying enormously across cul-  
tures, and these are all a form of planned event. From the industry perspective, they are often  
termed functions when held in venues that cater to individual and small-group clients. From  
weddings to birthday celebrations, bar/bat mitzvahs to funerals, holiday theme parties to church  
socials, they might require professionals or be entirely arranged by the participants. The expe-  
rience is both personal and social, with multiple meanings possible. Most can be considered  
celebrations in which a theme and emotional stimulation are essential.  
Quite a few practitioner-oriented books have been devoted to the planning and design of wed-  
dings, parties, and other private functions. Weddings are such a universally important event  
that they have become big business and the subject of serious study \(e.g., the book Cinderella  
Dreams\: The Allure of the Lavish Wedding, by Otnes and Pleck, 2003\). Shone and Parry \(2004\) in  
their book Successful Event Management provided details of the UK wedding ‘industry’. Planned  
reunions are held frequently for the military, schools, churches, and affinity groups, giving rise  
to reunion tourism and special promotions by destinations that have seen large out-migration  
and want to bring expatriates home for a visit. There is also a venue, hotel, and restaurant  
management literature that examines the case of banquets, parties, and other events held in  
formal settings.  
Holiday celebrations\: The calendar is marked by many holidays, both legally established and  
informal, and while they vary from country to country there are some that have become widely  
popular. New Year’s celebrations are marked the world over, with many associated special  
events becoming major tourist attractions – examples include the Times Square party and  
entertainment extravaganza in New York and Hogmanay in Edinburgh. Christmas markets are  
a common feature in Europe, and Easter in many countries is a time for religious processions  
and other rituals. Halloween has become widely celebrated with informal trick-or-treating,  
private costume parties, and in some places mass revelry.  
STUDY GUIDE  
In examining each of the main forms of planned celebrations, from festivals to private func-  
tions, we also introduced some important facts and theories about the nature of event experi-  
ences and their multiple meanings. Discussion of unplanned events reveals how the forms and  
experiences can be the same, as well as being similar with regard to important management Celebration Events and eXPeriences 113  
issues such as security and safety. The virtual event experience can be contrasted with any of  
these live-event experiences. This chapter and the next therefore provide a basis for planning  
and designing events.  
Read the Profile by Steve Brown carefully, looking for pandemic-related agile management  
\(also covered previously in the SHIFT case\), the reasons for creating a new festival, the nature  
of installation art, and the design elements being emphasised.  
Consider your own experiences at different types of events. How do they match with the points  
made in this chapter? How are technology and social-media networking influencing choices  
and experiences? What does celebration mean in the age of AI?  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Describe the essential differences between each major type of planned and unplanned cel-  
ebration, including fundamental differences in experiences and programmed elements of  
style associated with them.  
l What are the differences between festivals and carnivals? What does carnivalesque mean?  
l What are commemorations sometimes controversial? are all events potentially divisive, as

# Business and Trade Events \(MICE\)  
According to Spiller \(2002\), the modern convention industry grew in concert with industri-  
alisation and trade in the late nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth. A parallel  
movement was the growth of trade, professional, and affinity associations of all kinds. The first  
convention bureau in the USA was established in 1896 in Detroit, and at that time hotels were  
the main suppliers of venues.  
You will often see this large sector of planned events referred to as the MICE industry, or  
meetings, incentives, conventions \(including conferences and congresses\), and exhibitions.  
The fundamental purpose of this category of events is to promote, market, or directly engage  
in commerce, or otherwise meet corporate objectives. Farmers’ markets, fairs, and exhibitions  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003374251-6 Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences \(trade and consumer shows\) are clearly based on marketing and selling. World’s fairs, or expos,  
represent national place marketing and foster international trade and tourism. Meetings and  
conventions are mostly related to the affairs of associations and corporations and might involve  
learning, morale building, and making policies. Individual companies produce or sponsor many  
types of events for both internal purposes \(e.g., training\) and with an external orientation  
\(e.g., grand openings, exhibits, and sales at festivals\).  
Incentive refers to the widespread practice of rewarding employees through travel or other  
perks. There are specialist companies that organise incentive tours, often including parties  
and, if some form of excuse is really needed \(say, for income-tax purposes\), packaging formal  
meetings or lectures with the more hedonistic components. The entire incentive experience  
might be viewed as a special event for the participants and designers.  
We should not overlook the fact that corporate and other private events may also possess  
­ cultural significance \(e.g., a ginseng fair in Korea became a major annual festival\), or be of politi-  
cal interest \(e.g., countries competing for attention and reputation at world’s fairs\). Many busi-  
ness and trade events are closely associated with hotels, resorts, and convention and ­ exhibition  
centres, and are thereby important elements in the tourism and hospitality ­ industries, with a  
variety of stakeholders \(Jin et al., 2012\). When events are developed and marketed as tourist  
attractions or destination image-makers, they enter the realm of place marketing.  
Mair \(2012\) reviewed 144 articles from the business-event literature for the period 2000 to  
2009, the vast majority of which were published in the Journal of Convention and Event ­ Tourism.  
Major themes include the meeting planner, technology, economic impact assessments, venue  
selection, evaluation of satisfaction, the role of destination image on attendance, and the  
decision-making processes of attendees.

*Meetings, Conventions, Conferences, and Congresses*  
Several related terms have to be defined, drawing from the Dictionary of Event Studies, Event  
­ Management and Event Tourism \(Getz, 2021\)\:  
Meetings\: Meetings are generally small and often routinely scheduled events involving face-­ to-  
face assembly. Virtual meetings occurring online became part of the new normal during the  
pandemic and will likely remain popular given the readily available technology to link home  
and business devices. To meet with does not necessarily imply an event, it can refer to two  
people getting together. Meeting Professionals International \(MPI\) \(https\://www.mpi.org/\)  
distinguishes between association, corporate, scientific, and incentive meetings.  
Conventions are held by formal organisations, such as professional associations and politi-  
cal parties, and typically involve discussion, debate, and election of officers. A convener is an  
­ official charged with the responsibility of scheduling and organising the event, but professional  
­ planners are likely to be involved. Some conventions are open to all members, whereas for  
others delegates are chosen or elected to attend, in which case they have been delegated to vote  
on certain matters.  
A conference can be held on any subject, bringing people together for discussion, interaction,  
and education. The academic world is full of conferences where researchers present papers on  
the conference theme, and there are several held each year concerning event management and  
event tourism. The root word, confer, means to meet for purposes of deliberation or consulta-  
tion. It can also be used for ceremonies where degrees or awards are conferred upon deserving  
people. The term Congress is typically employed only for international assemblies, as in World 116  
Business, Sport, and Other Event Experiences  
Congress on a specific theme. Sometimes this designation appears to be used to boost the  
image of a rather ordinary conference.  
Association versus corporate events\: Meeting planners and tourist organisations generally distin-  
guish between events held by and for associations or corporations, as they involve different  
participation criteria, marketing, and logistics. Associations usually open their conferences to  
all members and often invite others to attend – especially as speakers. The annual conference of  
a professional association, for example, IFEA \(International Festivals and Events Association\)  
has many elements that can be considered educational, entertaining, celebratory, and legalistic.  
The corporate segment is different in a number of ways. Companies hosting large numbers of  
meetings and conventions are likely to employ their own event managers or meeting planners,  
although large associations also do this. Corporate events are also likely to be more diverse  
than those initiated by associations, including training, hospitality, product launches, moti-  
vational assemblies, retreats, publicity events, grand openings, and team-building exercises.  
There is a strong tendency for corporate clients to repeatedly use the same venues, and strong  
links have been forged between corporations and specific hotel and resort chains for this  
purpose.  
Pandemic impacts and trends  
The pandemic was disastrous for the MICE sector, and while the recovery was swift, it was not uniform  
or smooth. Observers believe structural changes are emerging, of which the permanence of virtual  
and hybrid events is one. Online observers point to a number of other trends that are worth noting  
\(sources\: https\://www.eventindustrynews.com/news/meetings-events-industry-trends-and-  
predictions-for-2023, https\://meetings.skift.com/event-statistics/, https\://www.cvent.com/  
en/blog/events/event-trends\).  
Meeting planners are more aware of the rising costs and real or perceived barriers to travel.  
That makes them more focused on delivering timely, personalised, transformational experi-  
ences, facilitating travel \(with contingencies in place\), and choosing authentic, inclusive des-  
tinations. The so-called weaponisation of travel applies increasingly to events, being the choices  
people make \(with related advocacy\) to shun venues and destinations that are not democratic  
and openly inclusive. Even though in–house and online meetings multiplied greatly during the  
pandemic, and because of new work-home arrangements that will continue to be necessary,  
demand for venues rose so quickly in 2022, accompanied by workforce withdrawals, that com-  
petition became intense for good locations and venues.  
The greening of events continues to be an important trend, especially as sustainability practices  
can ease costs for suppliers and attendees. Wellness of the workforce was coming to the fore  
during and after the pandemic, and this affects both the event \(ensuring it is safe, healthy, and  
relaxing\) and organisational culture. Combining work and business has always been a choice  
for event-goers, but now companies are recognising that it adds to motivation and wellness  
\(unfortunately, some are calling this bleisure\).  
Motivation and experiences  
Oppermann and Chon \(1997\) discussed the decision process, constraints, and both ­ extrinsic  
and intrinsic motivations for convention attendance by members of associations. They  
observed both push and pull factors and noted that many people were annual attendees. Business, Sport, and Other Event Experiences Van Riper et al. \(2013\) focused on one of the key motives for conference attendance, that  
being social networking. Much choice exists, so intervening opportunities, locational factors,  
and destination image play a role. Davidson \(2003\) discussed the benefits to destinations and  
convention-goers in adding pleasure to their business trips. A convention might represent  
a rare or once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit an attractive area. Spouses and other family  
members often want to come along.  
Event marketers need to know more about how to attract and satisfy their clientele, while in  
Event Studies we want to know if these experiences are categorically different from those at  
other events. An interesting perspective to engage the audience at conferences is the use of  
drama – described by Nelson \(2009\) as dramaturgy. The purpose is to enhance the experience  
by using creative and emotional cues that introduce a dramatic element to the experience.  
Rittichainuwat et al. \(2001\) determined that attendees at a hospitality educator/researcher  
conference were motivated primarily by self-enhancement, business and association activities,  
and sightseeing. The work of Severt et al. \(2007\) revealed that different types of conferences  
and meetings will be associated with different motivators and experiential dimensions. They  
studied the motivations, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions of a group of small busi-  
ness owners and managers attending a regional conference with an exhibition, produced by  
a national trade association. Their most important motivations for attending, in order, were\:  
education; educational information at exhibits; reasonable travel time to the event; network-  
ing opportunities; and business activities. Four of these five are clearly experiential in nature,  
while accessibility is a facilitating/constraining factor. Attendees were very satisfied with the  
educational component, ranking it highest. Those most satisfied with education were the most  
satisfied overall, and the most likely to both return and tell others to attend the conference.  
The Centre for Exhibition Research \(CEIR, 2003\) confirmed that face-to-face interaction is  
vital in marketing, and this will ensure the continuance of live events despite the impact of  
social media on networking with people virtually. Indeed, it appears that although business  
events are the first to be cancelled in times of trouble \(terrorism, pandemics, and natural  
disasters\), they bounce back very quickly and continue to grow in number. This remains true  
in 2023.

*Exhibitions \(Trade and Consumer Shows\)*  
Morrow’s \(1997\) The Art of the Show \(produced for the International Association for Expo-  
sition Management – IAEM\) highlighted the core purpose of trade and consumer shows, as  
they “provide a time sensitive, temporary marketing environment where the buyer comes to the seller”.  
Consumer shows are open to the public, often with an admission fee, and popular themes are  
linked to automobiles, sports, health, travel and recreation, pets, electronics, gardening, arts  
and crafts, or other hobbies. The producer, usually a private company, moves the show from  
place to place so that it is often periodically held in a given community. Venue owners might  
also produce their own. Manufacturers test new products at shows, retailers try to sell, and the  
consumer is searching for both ideas and entertainment. Gottlieb et al. \(2013\) evaluated con-  
sumer behaviour at such events and concluded that entertainment, product/industry research,  
and the facilitation of purchase decision-making processes and problem resolution are the key  
objectives for consumer attendees. Research by Rittichainuwat and Mair \(2012\) isolated two  
clusters at travel shows, the first being shoppers whose major motivation is purchasing, and  
the second called ‘total visitors’, whose motivation combines information searching and learning  
about trends. 118  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
Trade shows are usually for invitees only, based on specific business needs or industry-association  
membership. Manufacturers or suppliers exhibiting at these events are trying to sell their  
products and services, or at least trying to inform potential customers. Common types are  
industrial, scientific, engineering, or health care. Many include educational presentations or  
seminars. Frequently they are attached to association conventions, such as when suppliers to  
the events industry exhibit at professional association meetings. International trade fairs are a  
special class. Typically, they are at the large end and are targeted at a global or multi-country  
audience; they are, therefore, usually held in cities with major airports and exhibition halls.  
The Center for Exhibition Industry Research \(www.ceir.org\) exists to provide data to the indus-  
try. According to CEIR, “Attendees rate exhibitions as the number one most useful source of informa-  
tion with which to make a buying decision”. Professionals attend trade shows to learn about new  
products and meet face-to-face with suppliers. Often competitive products can be evaluated  
side by side, which helps explain why people go to consumer shows where many manu-  
facturers exhibit side by side. The entertainment and social aspects of shows must not be  
underestimated – attendees should have fun while learning. Exhibitions have a seasonal  
rhythm, with the lowest month \(in North America\) for show-starts being December and the  
peak two months being \(almost equally\) October and March. Summer \(July and August\) con-  
stitutes the second low season. Part of the growth in venues is attributable to the shortfall of  
space during the two peak exhibition seasons. See Frost and Laing \(2017\) for a detailed review  
of exhibitions and trade fairs.  
CEIR documented the effects of the pandemic, citing cancellations of over 90%, but with a  
strong recovery trend in 2022. They expected 2023 to be a challenging year for the ­ exhibition  
industry, mostly related to economic worries about a recession but predicted a full recovery in  
2024\. The money spent on exhibitions rises and falls with key economic performance indicators.  
Fairs  
This is another word with multiple, and often confusing, meanings. Dictionaries recognise  
the following\:  
l A gathering held at a specified time and place for the buying and selling of goods \(i.e., a  
market\).  
l An exhibition \(e.g., of farm products or manufactured goods, usually accompanied by ­ various  
competitions and entertainments, as in a state fair\); exhibitors may be in ­ competition for  
prizes.  
l An exhibition intended to inform people about a product or business opportunity.  
l An event, usually for the benefit of a charity or public institution, includes entertainment  
and the sale of goods \(also called a bazaar\).  
The term festival is sometimes used as a synonym of fair, but fairs have a long tradition of their  
own, such as periodic exhibitions and markets. Waters \(1939\) traced the history of fairs from  
the earliest days of human barter and trade. Although North Americans associate the word  
market with a place to do shopping, fairs were originally occasional markets. Every society  
had to have fairs, where goods were sold and traded at specific times, and usually in specific  
places that became markets or fairgrounds. The Latin word feriae, meaning holy day \(which  
evolved into the holiday\), is the origin of the English word fair. They were often scheduled  
on church-sanctioned holy days. Although fairs were often associated with religious celebra-  
tions, and now usually contain entertainment and amusements, fairs have more to do with Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences productivity and business than with themed public celebrations. Indeed, Abrahams \(1987\)  
argued that fairs and festivals are like mirror images. But he also suggested that in modern,  
urban society they have become almost synonymous because the old ways of production, as  
celebrated in fairs, have faded.  
The IAFE \(International Association of Fairs and Expositions\) website \(www.fairsandexpos.com\)  
provides some history. Most traditional fairs in North America are the numerous county and  
state fairs which are held annually on the same site, most of which continue to reflect rural  
and agricultural themes \(see, for example, Rasmussen’s 2015 study of the Iowa State Fair\).  
Some are called exhibitions or expositions, reflecting their educational orientation. Most fairs are  
operated by independent boards or agricultural societies, though many have close links with  
the host municipality. Typical elements of agricultural fairs and exhibitions include agricultural  
demonstrations and contests, sales and trade shows \(farm machinery, etc.\), amusements of all  
kinds, eating and drinking, parades, and a variety of entertainment. Education is also a vital  
programme element, with close ties to 4H clubs as an example. This type of fair is often called  
a show in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The lines between types of shows, fairs, and  
markets are sometimes hard to distinguish. For example, Morgner \(2014\) examined the devel-  
opment of art fairs as a kind of trade show to sell and distribute art.  
119  
World’s fairs  
World’s fair has a very specific meaning, derived from an international agreement in  
1928 and regulated by the Bureau International des Expositions \(BIE\) in Paris \(https\://  
www.­ bie-paris.org/\). BIE sets the policies for bidding on and holding world’s fairs, which  
are often called Expos. Their nominal purpose has always been educational, with particular  
attention paid to technological progress, but some authors have described them as glorified  
trade fairs \(­ Benedict, 1983\). Findling and Pelle \(2008\) provided a comprehensive review of  
100 countries and the world’s fairs held since 1851 in their Encyclopedia of World’s Fairs and  
Expositions. A detailed analysis of Vancouver’s World Fair was completed by Olds and Ley  
\(1988\), and De Groote \(2005\) traced the evolution of world’s fairs, focusing on the 1992  
Expo in Seville, Spain.  
There is a large body of literature on world’s fairs, reflecting both their significance in eco-  
nomic and social terms and their popularity among Expo lovers. Competition to host them  
was once fierce, as cities and countries saw them as an opportunity to attract attention and  
tourists, typically in concert with urban renewal or other development schemes. Many think of  
Expos in the same light as other mega events, that they are exercises in branding for nations  
and so-called world cities. World’s fairs are almost always accompanied by controversy, owing  
to their large costs and environmental and social impacts. Governments have shamelessly used  
them \(and other mega events\) for their own purposes, leading Hall \(1992\) to call them polit-  
ical tools. Most of them have generated a permanent built legacy \(especially symbols like the  
Eiffel Tower\) through planned urban renewal or development, while heavy tourism promotion  
has not always succeeded in generating sufficient attendance. Nostalgia for world’s fairs is  
rampant, judging by websites devoted to their images and trading in memorabilia. Some, like  
Montreal’s Expo ’67, achieved iconic status – it will always be remembered as a nation-defining  
event for Canada – and one that left Montrealers with decades of debt.  
Some of the relevant research\: motivations and images held by foreign tourists at the Shang-  
hai Expo \(Kim S., et al., 2012\); local residents’ perceptions of impacts \(Yang et al., 2010\);  
Hereźniak and Florek \(2018\) on citizen involvement and place branding in Expo cities; effects 120  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
on a city’s image \(Xue et al., 2012\); carbon emissions and sustainability \(Gallo et al., 2020\),  
and world’s fairs and national branding \(Gębarowski, 2022; Tudor, 2022\).  
Motivation and experiences  
According to Mair \(2013\), conferences and exhibitions continue to play a major role in the  
world of business and trade, despite the rise of social media and technology-enabled commu-  
nication for facilitating virtual meetings of customers and clients. A study by Jung \(2005\) on  
exhibition attendee perceptions of service quality gave some insight into desired experiences,  
namely, the importance assigned to the number of exhibitors, the quality of goods and services  
exhibited, and the seminars, conferences, and other events that were part of it. These are all  
product-quality items that reflect the learning and marketing content of the event.  
*Corporate Events*  
Any event produced by or for a corporation falls into this large category, but the term corporate  
event is generally associated with a range of events aimed at the public or for business-to-business  
purposes – that is, for external audiences \(see Mishra et al., 1997\). Internal events will more  
appropriately be termed meetings, although the boundaries can be blurred. Saget \(2006, 13\)  
suggested that the essence of corporate events is relationship marketing. Saget distinguished  
between event managers and event marketers. Event marketers have to ask what messages  
they are trying to convey to their customers. Are they trying to get the audience to buy some-  
thing? How will the event impact on sales? There is also an evolving debate about the wider  
motives for corporate event sponsorship, as Seguin et al. \(2010\) highlighted in terms of corpo-  
rate social responsibility. This is also a theme Babiak and Wolfe \(2006\) examined in relation to  
the Super Bowl and more generic themes \(Babiak and Wolfe, 2009\). More recent analysis has  
also focused on the theme of corporate social responsibility and sport as a tool for develop-  
ment in less developed countries \(e.g., see Levermore, 2010\) as well as more generic overviews  
\(e.g., Slack and Thurston, 2014\). Further discussion of corporate events is provided by Ulrich  
Wünsch in Expert Opinion 6.1.  
EXPERT OPINION 6.1\: By Professor Dr. Ulrich Wünsch  
Corporate Events  
Professor Dr. Ulrich Wünsch is a former President and professor at srH University of  
Popular Arts \(University of Applied Science\) in Berlin, Germany. He is both a practitioner  
and academic \(in the field of media and communication science, media aesthetics, and  
audience research\), specialising in corporate events and scenography.

*and Practice for Event Success*. Bad Honnef, Germany\: K. H. Bock.  
Before starting\:  
This text \(and its author\) considers corporate events from the angle of “business”,  
understood as a cultural practice of the last more or less 200 years arising from a  
“British-American” lineage of philosophical and economical thinking and doing, coming  
out of the “enlightment” and of a protestant British reasoning lifestyle. It acknowledges Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 121  
that there are different ways of the cultural practice of “doing business events” in  
­ countries beyond, yet in a global cooperation \(how tight or loose it may be in its supply  
chains\) the dominant paradigm is one of efficiency, effectiveness, and profit combined  
with a set of generic aesthetics coined by a century of advertising \(this being now trans-  
formed by social media and the emergence of various styles and a mix of styles, which  
anyway is a sign of “modernity”\).  
This text will very briefly touch upon some aspects of a special form of corporate  
activity\: the event. These undertakings of companies in order to reach out to the  
public \(being understood as consumers, clients, employees, or other stakeholders of  
the event’s cause and company\) within a sphere of face-to-face encounters are often  
labelled as live communication or experiential communication. The expression draws  
the line between two-dimensional mass communications, also defined as a commu-  
nication of ‘one-to-many’, and the so-called real-time and real-space engagement as  
a form of ‘some-to-some’ or group communication. With digitisation reaching into  
more and more ways of conducting business, and with the global Covid-19 pandemic,  
“hybrid” \(a mix between online and offline\) or online events became more prominent  
or even dominant as people were not encountering each other face-to-face. Those  
formats of corporate events are here to stay, even though a “zoom-fatigue” arose,  
even though initial trust needed in doing business is being built by personal face-to-  
face meetings, even though hybrid events are more costly than pure online or offline  
events.  
Corporate events arose with the dawn of industrialisation \(around the 1820s\) before  
mass media were the main channels of communication. In the late nineteenth cen-  
tury, innovative entrepreneurs such as Heinz \(usa, Ketchup\), Michelin \(France, tyres  
for cars\), and Lingner \(Germany, hygiene products\) employed various innovative  
forms and formats \(such as product characters in festivities, product shows on a  
pier, political demonstrations and more\) to interest their consumers. In the 1920s,  
Mr. Procter and Mr. Gamble realised that the initial and first personal contact with a  
product \(the so-called ‘Moment of Truth’ on the store shelf and while its first usage\)  
was a very crucial point within the marketing cycle. Experiences stemming from  
intimate encounters \(with products or by relation to trusted others\) were then, and  
are today, the key to purchasing decisions. The experience economy, a term coined  
in the late 1980s, concentrates on this finding in highlighting that in a saturated  
market, something beyond price is needed to trigger the action to desire an object  
and pay for it.  
Corporate events come in many formats, all reaching back to the original live commu-  
nication activities of humankind\: ritualistic festivity and staged entertainment. Today  
exhibitions, conferences, product launches, promotion undertakings, incentives,  
plus more and ever newly developed formats such as ambush or guerrilla marketing  
events, such as digital formats and social media interlinkage of, with, or for events are  
being employed to reach out to external or internal target groups of the company  
or product. To provide realistic figures on the monetary size, the turnover of and  
within the events industry is “tricky”. Definitions of formats and segments vary, and  
selection and methods for gathering relevant data are not very accurate. A globally  
accepted \(and maybe upheld by the un by its Statistics Division under its Department 122  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
of Economic and Social Affairs\) definition of the content and scope of the events  
industry is still not available. An example of market research statistics is given by amr  
\(Allied Market Research\) provides these definitions and figures\: size of the whole  
events industry was \$1,135.4 billion in 2019 and is supposed to rise to \$1,552.9 bil-  
lion. This includes concerts, festivals, sports, exhibitions and conferences, corporate  
events and seminars, and other not defined formats. Corporate events with 27.7% of  
the whole held the major share – including exhibitors and conferences, events which  
more often are held by and for corporations, the share rises by about another 13%.  
vmr \(Verified Market Research\), another company commercially providing data, con-  
cludes that the global events market size in 2020 was \$886.99, growing to \$2,194.40  
billion in 2028. Statista, another market research source, provides data on e-Services,  
using event ticket sales in the field of sport events to show a revenue of \$27.04 billion  
in 2023 worldwide, whereas music-event ticket sales will amount to \$27.08 billion in  
revenue. With China being the second largest economy, amr shows that the Asian  
event market in 2018 was valued at \$273.8 billion with corporate events holding a  
share of 58.56%.  
Whether the event industry is an industry in its own right, or part of the marketing &  
communication industry or the tourism industry is of a more academic or statistical  
value. The fact that companies started around the year 2000 to develop and brand  
their own events being staged in public on common ground \(e.g., Red Bull with its  
various sports formats, or Guinness Brewery with Saint Patrick’s Day, as well as in-house  
events such as an Apple developers conference and a Google Bootcamp\) seems to  
point out that a ‘special’ field or branch closely connected with media and entertain-  
ment is emerging.  
Events are being employed in corporate attention management to provide special  
or extraordinary experiences. Experiences as such are the product of the ongoing  
activity called ‘living’ and produce only unfocused attention within the organic sys-  
tem “man”. Thus, the design process, understood as focus management, sits at the  
beginning and at the forefront of event production, not the organisation of events.  
For academic Event Studies, this means that beyond the basic economic and project  
management research mainly undertaken so far, social sciences/humanities are valid.  
To produce economically successful events, one has to understand human beings  
and employ findings from sociology, aesthetics, religious studies, psychology, biol-  
ogy, and more.  
With the establishment of the digital society, new forms of the entwinement of the  
‘real’ and the ‘virtual’ arise in 3-D-world, taking on formats beyond our momen-  
tary imagination \(just think how quickly the smartphone changed our lives and  
created interaction with a non-physical realm\). The ability of human beings to be  
immersed \(the attention, brain, and the self are focused on a world in a dream, a  
movie, a book, a computer game\) will lead to combinations of events in worlds  
only dreamt of by science fiction writers so far \(“Second Life” or “Metaverse” were  
only a clumsy beginning\). Events will continue to evolve, and corporations are at  
the forefront of the technicalities of this field of evolution whereas the multiple  
crises of the climate and the economic and social cover the other main field of this  
evolution of events. Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 123  
To illustrate a corporate event, the example of the activities and concept of Bayer’s  
\(global chemical and pharmaceutical industry corporation stemming from Germany\)  
corporate jubilee is briefly described. Though it was executed a while ago, the for-  
mat, challenges, topics, and structure are valid and “telling”. The 150th anniversary  
of Bayer occurred in 2013. In 2011, the communication department started to plan.  
In 2012 the operations to produce a year-long, global event were under way. The  
first and main target group was the company’s 100,000 employees, followed by the  
general public and special interest groups such as politicians the media, and con-  
sumers of products and services of Bayer. The claim ‘Science for a Better Life’ had  
to be portrayed as mandatory. It was clear that the events were not a single solu-  
tion. Integrated communication was the goal and the cross-fertilisation of media and  
messages that arose formed one event’s core idea produced in various forms and  
distributed via various media. Germany as the mother market plus 100 daughter  
companies worldwide had to be integrated into the event year. Activities such as  
30,000 employees forming the world’s largest living Bayer cross \(the official company  
logo\) on the lawn of a stadium at the headquarters in Leverkusen were planned.  
A 41-metre-long Bayer ‘blimp’ \(small cargo airship\) travelled around the globe in  
2013, stopping in London, New York, Toronto, Tokyo, and Mexico City to name just a  
few destinations. Interested employees created a new Bayer song, which was played  
at all jubilee events in 2013. A big cultural show, with paintings from Bayer’s art col-  
lection, spanning 150 years, was curated and on display at Berlin’s main municipal  
museum for three months. A new corporate film was shot; science research activi-  
ties for youngsters were funded and integrated into a special completion of ideas;  
a science symposium was held. Social sponsoring and donations for local projects  
and communities were integral parts of the concept. Festivals for employees were  
held globally on 29 June, Bayer’s founding day; the then German Chancellor \(Angela  
Merkel\) showed up for the main event. On Celebration Day, a festive jubilee menu  
was served to Bayer employees around the globe, starting in New Zealand. In Ger-  
many alone, 3,000 litres of tomato soup and 1.5 tonnes of couscous salad were  
served. The goal, to reach out to the public and put Bayer on the map worldwide,  
was successfully reached via 16 million PR and tv contacts, which Bayer did not  
have to pay for – online visits at a special anniversary website not included. All this  
was steered by a core team of three leading event creators and planners/managers  
in Leverkusen, Germany, plus an array of consultants and external agencies, artists,  
and workers. Bayer’s Ceo was satisfied, even though the amount of money put into  
the event was noteworthy. Yet the results – employer loyalty and public awareness –  
were convincing. Further case studies might be discovered in special interest maga-  
zines on the event or experiential marketing.  
With climate change and the Anthropocene having established themselves as driving  
forces in the shaping of our next steps, corporate events in the future will have to  
adhere to sustainability or “green” standards. Rulebooks, manuals, and international  
standards on the execution of events already exist as the Sustainable Development  
Goals of the un describe the playing field. New formats might arise from a reduction  
in travel, in buildings made of concrete, in consumption, and other changes we truly  
cannot forecast; yet it can be assumed that events will always be around to orientate  
men and women in the social fabric of their lives \(Plate 6.1\). 124

# Educational and Scientific Events  
Often considered as a subset of business and trade events, these are nevertheless different  
because of their emphasis on creating and exchanging knowledge for the sake of knowledge.  
Academic and professional symposia, and conferences on specific themes, are the main com-  
ponents of this category of planned event, although numerous small, private meetings are also  
held for these purposes. Education, including participative styles as well as demonstrative  
training, is the hallmark experience of these events. But that is no reason why they should  
not also be social and fun events. It is obvious that most people attending scientific and aca-  
demic conferences are searching for knowledge, and some cities such as Glasgow, Scotland,  
have deliberately targeted these events as key sectors in event and conference strategies. Such  
events also have wider appeal in an increasingly globalised academic community in terms of  
networking and socialising with old friends and colleagues. This is likely to be an age-related  
variable.  
# Political and State Events  
Any event produced for or by governments and political parties falls into this category. Such  
events always seem to be in the news, including the following examples\:  
l The G8 summit of leading industrialised nations.  
l Royal coronations, weddings \(see Laing and Frost, 2017\).  
l Papal tours and related religious festivals. Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 125  
l VIP visits \(e.g., heads of state\).  
l Inauguration of the American President.  
l Investiture of a prince.  
l Political party conventions.  
Most political and state events are security challenges. When leaders assemble or governments  
meet, or when a VIP tours, the media pay close attention – and so do people who want to pro-  
test or disrupt. For an example, see\: Gulliver, R. E., Banks, R., Fielding, K. S., & Louis, W. R.  
\(2023\). The criminalisation of climate change protest. Contention, 11 \(1\), 24–54.  
# Sport and Recreational Events  
By definition, sport events are the actual games or meetings during which sport activity occurs.  
There are many sport event formats \(see, for example, Solomon, 2002\), and one classification  
includes\:  
l Professional or amateur.  
l Indoor or outdoor \(and other differences in their need for special venues\).  
l Regularly scheduled \(league play, plus play-offs or championships\) or one-time \(exhibition  
or friendly matches\).  
l Local, regional, national, or international in scope.  
l For participants, spectators, or both.  
l Sport festivals \(a celebration of sport, often for youth, involving many sports\).  
l Single sport, or multi-sport events like the Olympics and Masters Games.  
l Touring teams.  
This is an enormous field, given the huge number of sport events occurring around the world  
all the time, not to mention the increasing diversity of sports and forms of sport events. The  
influence of the media has been profound, creating a whole category of media-oriented events  
that probably would not otherwise exist.  
Graham et al.’s \(1995\) The Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management and Marketing noted there  
were literally millions of jobs in sports in the USA, including a growing number specific to  
the production, management, and marketing of events. These authors argued \(1995, 8\) that  
sport events and other special events share commonalities, including their service orientation,  
the incorporation of celebration and drama, media coverage, and similarities in organising  
and operations. Motivations of customers and travellers might also be similar, especially with  
regard to the ritual of attendance and related traditions. Traditional sport events like the Olym-  
pics always incorporate ceremonies and festivals, and it has now become commonplace to build  
a programme of special events around a sport meet to create a festival or special event with  
heightened appeal.  
*Sport Versus Recreation*  
Recreational events are generally produced by parks and recreation agencies, non-profit organ-  
isations, and affinity groups \(like churches, schools, and clubs\) for non-competitive rea-  
sons and are often playful in nature. Such events might be informal in their production and 126  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
management, and they may even be self-organised by groups. If only individuals are involved,  
we will have to call it activity and not an event. Examples of recreational events are really  
­ unlimited in number and scope, from card games to pick up football, from dance and exercise  
classes to impromptu concerts.  
*Competitive Sport/Recreation Event Experiences \(for Athletes\)*  
Although competitive sports superficially involve games played by persons or teams with the  
intent of winning, that in itself does not constitute the entire experience or meaning. Many people  
compete for very personal reasons, such as to gain fitness and mastery, while others compete for  
social reasons – to be part of a group and to enjoy a social event. Bouchet et al. \(2004\) reviewed the  
literature on sport tourist experiences and concluded there are four theoretical streams evident.  
From a behavioural theory perspective, group activities and interactions are the focus. For example,  
Green and Chalip \(1998\) found that strong subcultural meanings were attached by participants  
to a women’s sport event. From cognitive psychology comes attention to needs, motives, values,  
and risk-taking. A third approach combines the psychological and behavioural roles of travellers,  
and the fourth is the experiential model. Bouchet et al. \(2004\) advanced their own approach  
to analysing the sport tourist experience, encompassing considerations of self-worth \(perceived  
risk, optimal stimulation, variety, and novelty-seeking\), spatial variables, or the place \(including  
­ functional components and a post-modernist view of how visitors create their own experiences  
and living space\), and interpersonal variables \(new relationships and communitas\).  
What particularly distinguishes competitive sport experiences from any other event experi-  
ences is the structure \(venues, rules, and team versus single play\), all of which are specific to  
each sport. Either this structure appeals to a person or it does not, and the diversity of sport  
gives rise to an almost infinite variety of experiential possibilities. Some are less combative  
than others, some require brute strength, and others demand finesse and artistry. Sport is both  
highly personal \(what the athlete accomplishes on their own\) and social \(the team, the com-  
munity of athletes, and the whole event organisation\).  
*The Sport Spectator and Sport-Fan Experience*  
Sport spectating and participation, along with passive and active sport tourism, is a major  
global phenomenon that gives rise to numerous small and large events. Gibson \(1998, 2006\)  
found in her research that the ‘active sport tourist’ was mostly a male with a college education  
and higher income. This segment, she concluded, will likely continue to travel for participation  
in their favourite sports well into retirement. See the TransRockies profile in Chapter 1, with  
its references, for confirmation and elaboration. There are participation sports wherein males  
and females are more balanced in number.  
Youth sports are popular with entire families, generating many overnight visits for tourna-  
ments. It is reasonable to suggest, however, that most sport events take place near home and  
are largely unrecorded in tourism statistics. Attending a sport event can be motivated by a  
desire for entertainment and spectacle \(i.e., simple diversion\), the desire for emotional stim-  
ulation, or having a social outing. Being a sport spectator is a role we can all play, and most  
spectators know that it is generally more interesting \(certainly more emotionally exciting\) to  
be at a live event as opposed to watching on a TV or a small phone.  
Being a sport fan, however, is something quite a bit more engaging. Wann \(1995\) and Wann  
et al. \(1999\) developed a ‘sport-fan motivation scale’ that covers both intrinsic and extrinsic Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences motivation. It consists of eight common reasons for watching sport, and these can also be  
conceptualised as desired experiences\: escape, eustress \(i.e., stress evoked by emotions or  
events, here considered to be positive stimulation\), aesthetics \(appreciation of the beauty of  
sports\), self-esteem, group affiliation, family, entertainment, and economics \(e.g., betting\).  
Chen \(2006\) provided a review of the literature on sport fans, in a paper devoted to a phenom-  
enological study of event sport fans’ behaviour, experiences, and values. Chen concluded that  
most studies suggest that personally relevant values \(from needs and the benefits sought\),  
and ‘identifications’ \(such as social identity\) most explain why fans become highly involved  
and committed to teams \(see also Bristow and Sebastion, 2001; Madrigal, 1995; Wann and  
Branscombe, 1993\). Chen’s \(2006\) study determined that personal balance and socialisation  
were the essential parts of the experiences being sought, and these were obtained through  
volunteering, being at events, travelling with other fans and the team, pilgrimages to places  
with special meanings, and non-related social and touristic activities in destinations. In a  
more contemporary article, Spracklen \(2022\) studied the links among sport fans as part of a  
fandom community.

# Events at the Margin  
There is also a category of events that are at the margins of what we mean by planned events.  
The purpose is to show that definitional boundaries are often blurred, and that planning is a  
matter of degree. Each event certainly creates a novel experience, and some are completely  
self-created experiences without the benefit of planners or designers \(although some would  
argue that is often a good thing!\).  
*Flash Mobs*  
These events are somewhat spontaneous and anti-establishment, even anarchist in their ori-  
gins or intent. Walker \(2013\) produced a historical, cultural, and philosophical analysis of the  
flash mob as a performance event, and Molnár \(2014\) traced its expansion as a feature of youth  
culture globally. Grant \(2016\) examined its use as a form of guerrilla marketing in entertain-  
ment. The flash mob depends upon personal communications devices to a large extent, which  
explains why it is largely a recent phenomenon and why it has expanded through social media  
networking. Attendees assemble in response to a message to be somewhere at a specific time,  
to do something strange or outrageous.  
They have a purpose, a place, and a short time duration, but no real programme – only activity.  
They are usually frivolous, but some do try to make a point. An individual, or a group, has to  
initiate the flash mob, but there is no real organisation or responsibility for it. If something  
goes terribly wrong, who gets the blame? The assertion that some flash mobbers are try-  
ing to reinvent public spaces is interesting and fits into the general pattern of carnivalesque  
behaviour and dancing in the street. This is also something like the valorisation process noted  
by Falassi, which is used to turn settings into the temporary festival and event spaces, only the  
goal of flash mobbers is presumably to show that the space belongs to the people. Or perhaps  
the purpose is to demonstrate that any space can be made festive or act as a performance set-  
ting. But how can you have a liberating, non-conforming event if at the same time, it becomes  
mainstream?  
It will be interesting to observe how these, and similar self-organised and spontaneous events  
evolve. In their most contemporary manifestations, they appear to be more about protest and 128  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
demonstration, as acts of collective response to incidents like bank failures \(e.g., USA in 2023\)  
or police crack-downs \(Hong Kong, frequently\). Because the protest communities are often  
pre-networked, it can be argued that spontaneity is minimal.  
*Protest! Demonstrate! Riot!*  
It seems that not a political or economic summit goes by without protests or riots, and often  
they appear to have been orchestrated. In fact, they are often semi-planned events and cer-  
tain websites \(perhaps forbidden to general searches\) provide advice on how to organise a  
demonstration or riot. While the rationale that people have a right to peacefully assemble is  
fine in most democratic nations, it is not a universally shared value. Furthermore, there is  
always the risk that those seeking disruption and violence will sabotage those with peaceful  
intent. Marches and demonstrations have a long social history \(see Rojek, 2013\), accom-  
panying every war, union–company conflict, and political movement. Currently, a favourite  
rallying cry is anti-globalisation, which appears to attract many diverse interest groups \(see  
Body-Gendrot, 2016\).

millan. https\://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/usa/19020.pdf  
*Recreational Rioting*  
This term recreational rioting seems to have emerged in the news media, reporting on events in  
Northern Ireland in 2010. It suggests that rioting, for some, is fun – or at least accepted in their  
culture as a legitimate outlet for pent-up emotions and a substitute for activities they have no  
access to. It is generally associated with segments of societies who believe they are oppressed.  
The phenomenon of children throwing stones or using real weapons is newsworthy, and there-  
fore can be encouraged or orchestrated by movements. Whether the provision of other leisure  
and event opportunities would put an end to recreational rioting, or whether or not this is an  
appropriate term at all, is an open question. It is a disturbing phenomenon, right alongside the  
occasional destructive behaviour of sports fans and other assemblies that turn violent or lead  
to disasters.  
# Experiences of Different Stakeholders  
Table 6.1 lists many of the principal event stakeholders, from guests and customers to the  
media and general public, each of which can have quite different experiences from the same  
event. A short discussion of each category ensues. The event experience is always at least  
partially dependent upon the expectations and attitudes of those involved and on one’s  
willingness to enter into the spirit of the occasion. As well, different stakeholders will be  
directly or indirectly affected and dependent on their roles. Accordingly, we need more  
understanding of the expectations people bring to events, and how they describe their expe-  
riences. Most of the experiences shown in this table are, of course, attainable by many of  
the stakeholders in many event settings. What Table 6.1 sets out to list are those attributes  
that could be different or special, for each stakeholder – not their full range of potential  
experiences. Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 129

might be stimulating, resulting in  
heightened emotions and unlawful  
actions  
*Paying Customers*  
Many events charge admission and attract paying customers who will expect delivery of the  
promised product/experience, to a high standard. They are entitled to complain if they do not  
get their perceived consumer benefit. Marketers might be content with determining satisfaction  
levels, as that is the simplest measure of effectiveness in a commercial context. Fans might have  
other experiences on their mind, including loyalty, communitas, and nostalgia. Cultural tourists  
might stress belonging and sharing, an authentic cultural experience and learning. Satisfaction  
levels therefore do not provide much insight into the event experience. Deeper inquiry can reveal  
how memorable the event was, its meaning to the customer \(especially in terms of personal and  
social constructs\), and whether or not the customer had a transforming experience in any way.  
These phenomenological measures could be potentially valuable for improving the event. Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 131  
*Guests*  
Guests are usually invited to a function, but the term embodies wider connotations, as in host-  
guest relations, or the adage “Treat every customer as a valued guest”. Hospitality is a key element  
in service quality. Guests expect to be greeted and honoured by their hosts. While guests at  
private parties know they were invited, which shapes their expectations about hospitality and  
possibly about service levels, making paying customers feel like guests is a real challenge. The  
guest experience will inevitably include a strong social component because they are part of an  
invited or favoured group. Communitas is often presupposed in this context, with all guests  
having an existing affiliation, but it also might have to be facilitated when strangers are in the  
mix. The use of esoteric rituals and symbols known only to ‘insiders’ is one form of bonding that  
designers can use, and in this context refer to our discussion elsewhere of social worlds.  
*Participants*  
This category consists of the athletes in sports or recreational events, dancers in dance festi-  
vals, musicians in music competitions, and to a degree the delegates attending conventions –  
depending on how engaged and active they become. The event is all about their experiences,  
and it does not exist without their participation. They are likely to feel that the event is for their  
benefit, and its organisers should respect their needs and wishes. Participants also might feel  
a personal responsibility for the success of the event, but that is contingent on factors such as  
who owns or sponsors it. Understanding participants’ experiences requires knowledge of their  
motives, expectations, activities, emotions, and cognitive processes in the specific context of the  
event. The full range of planned event experiences can apply, but participants are typically look-  
ing for mastery through meeting challenges, learning opportunities, and subcultural identity or  
communitas. For additional insights refer to our discussions of social worlds, serious leisure, and  
the highly involved.  
*Virtual Audiences*  
Presumably, most virtual experiences of planned events, especially TV coverage of sports and  
concerts, award ceremonies, and spectacles, would be described as entertainment. A key ques-  
tion for researchers is whether or not media experiences can be the same as live experiences  
in terms of emotional engagement and cognition. Can they be as memorable or transforming?  
With the rise of virtual and hybrid events, media theorists will have to distinguish between the  
participant, as discussed elsewhere, and the emotionally detached viewer.  
*Performers*  
This group consists of paid entertainers or athletes, all part of the show that customers want  
to experience. We must view them in a different light from performers in participation events  
because they have quite different motives. Gaining a sense of professional accomplishment  
has to be important because if their experience is bad it can negatively impact on the overall  
event quality and customer satisfaction. Producers generally know how to treat professionals  
with dignity and respect, and to look after their tangible and emotional needs. If the opportu-  
nity arises, some performers can also get to enjoy other parts of the event. Special attention  
will always be given to performers who are the attraction, which is the case in touring con-  
certs, as they are often in the celebrity and VIP categories who require \(and make demands  
in contracts!\) hospitality at a very high level, along with security, media attention, and fan  
adulation. 132  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
*Producers, Directors, and Senior Managers*  
Sometimes the producers/organisers are also involved, working alongside other volunteers, but for  
most events, they are completely detached from the experiences they are seeking to create. They  
can be representatives of funding agencies, governing bodies, sponsors, and other officials of gov-  
ernment regulators, and they might want to be put in the VIP category. They need to be conscious  
of what their events are accomplishing, and potential negative impacts or disasters. In legal terms,  
they might be held responsible. Separate categories are the directors and senior managers who  
have an immediate impact on the event production and are obviously responsible in some way for  
the experiences of attendees, staff, volunteers, and others, but they might remain relatively quiet  
and invisible during the ongoing event programme. They all need to be responsive to feedback and  
especially reflective on what they are responsible for in terms of potential negative impacts.  
*VIPs*  
Whether they are politicians, royalty, or celebrities, being a Very Important Person by definition  
means that event organisers will be giving them special treatment, honour, respect, and a lot  
of security, with protocol often determining what can and cannot be done. Their experience  
cannot possibly be the same as other guests or customers, and indeed they might become part  
of the spectacle, temporarily becoming performers. Despite these considerations, it might be  
possible to segregate VIPs enough that they can enjoy part of the event. Performers as VIPS are  
in a different category.  
*Officials and Security*  
Professional conduct and specific responsibilities govern the event experiences of referees,  
stewards, timekeepers, and other officials. They might be almost invisible, or play an important  
and highly visible role in the event. Their experiences will perhaps include off-duty enjoyment  
of part of the event, otherwise, their main concerns are purely technical. The experience of  
security personnel is restricted by their need for vigilance.  
*Regulators*  
This category of stakeholders \(e.g., building and health inspectors\) attends not only events to  
supervise and ensure compliance but also has to be made comfortable, kept safe, and has their  
basic technical and human needs looked after. Professional conduct defines their roles, but  
might they not take a little time to actually enjoy the event? Perhaps some of them deserve to  
have VIP status.  
*Sponsors and Donors*  
Unless they see themselves as regulators, the most important of these stakeholders should  
be given VIP treatment at events. Corporate sponsors often want specific hospitality services  
for themselves and their guests, even to the point of having private and exclusive areas and  
mini-events. Business has to be done, and that is an experience realm that does not have to  
be divorced from having fun. In addition to enjoying the event, which might be of secondary  
importance, facilitators also have a vested interest in its success, and might therefore play the  
role of supervisors or evaluators. Some might want status as producers or owners. Needless  
to say, their overall, multidimensional experience has to be made more than just satisfactory. Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences 133  
*Suppliers and Vendors*  
Often these contracted service and goods providers are brought into the event as sponsors as  
well, giving them a vested interest in its success. They might also find time to enjoy the event.  
Yet they have specific, professional functions to complete which have to be supervised and  
evaluated by event management. Health and safety will always be top priorities for suppliers  
and vendors.  
*Volunteers*  
To the extent that they interact with other people at the event, they are both helping to create,  
and share in, the experiences. Volunteers have a unique perspective on the overall experi-  
ence and how others are enjoying the event, and they have become a specific field of research  
within events \(see Stebbins and Graham, 2004 for an overview\), especially in the public/not-  
for-profit sectors. Volunteers have to be satisfied with several criteria, or they will not continue  
to volunteer.  
Johnston et al. \(2000\) found that sport involvement led directly to volunteering at sport events,  
which suggests that participants want an experience related to that sport, such as contact with  
its stars. Saleh and Wood \(1998\) found some unique motives held by volunteers at a multicul-  
tural festival, namely, sharing their culture and maintaining cultural links. Elstad \(1997\) stud-  
ied student volunteers at the Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway, and determined  
that satisfaction with their experience related most strongly to expanding personal networks,  
being part of the event atmosphere, and achieving job-related competence. In another study,  
Elstad \(2003\) found that the top reasons for event volunteers to quit were workload, lack of  
appreciation, and poor organisation, all of which suggest experiential implications.  
Ralston, Lumsdon, and Downward \(2005\) reviewed the literature on event volunteers, cover-  
ing motivation, profiles, satisfaction studies, and theory. The reasons why people volunteered  
clearly pertained to the experiences they sought, including excitement, uniqueness \(the chance  
of a lifetime\), meeting interesting people, and being part of a team. Meanings attached to the  
experience included supporting sport, doing something useful for the community, helping the  
city, region, and country, and using their skills. A review of the event-volunteer phenomenon  
by Schlenker, Edwards, and Wearing \(2014\) noted the episodic nature of event volunteering  
related to their timing and frequency, and this also has major implications for the use of paid  
staff.  
In Chapter 10, our discussion of volunteers is continued under Human Resource Management.  
*Paid Staff*  
Hanlon and Jago \(2012\) reviewed the nature of human resource needs in event management,  
observing the pulsating nature of events \(Hanlon and Cuskelly, 2002\) and the unusual demands  
this places on human resources. There might be quite different experiences for staff \(and this  
applies to many volunteers as well\) depending on their level of involvement through the entire  
planning and de-commissioning cycle. Most paid staff will be able to have some direct experi-  
ence of the event, if only when off-duty, but some, like overnight security, will not. All paid staff  
have specific duties, so they have to be supervised and evaluated, with event enjoyment being  
an ancillary goal, and \(ideally\) secondary to the experience of professional accomplishment.  
There can be overlap, of course, between the roles and experiences of volunteers, paid staff, 134  
Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences  
and performers. This will depend on the extent to which these groups are part of the show, and  
how dependent guests/customers are on each group for their experiences.  
*The Media*  
Some media people attending events will be official sponsors, in which case they require tech-  
nical support and VIP status. But there are also likely to be unofficial media whose access to  
the event might be restricted. Conflicts could occur between the two groups of media, between  
media and VIPs or performers, and between media and organisers/staff. Media relations has  
become a major task at events, and cannot be left to chance. If people have a bad personal or  
professional experience, the event’s image could consequently take a negative hit. In addition  
to the media and event experience, Dayan \(1994\) examined the televising and live broadcasting  
of historic events such as the Olympic Games. These were described as festive television or  
media events. Such events are therefore viewed not as routine but as cultural performances and  
are exceptionally planned events with the power to reach global audiences.  
*The Public at Large*  
There might be spillover effects from events, such as noise, light, traffic, smells, crowds, and  
bad behaviour, all of which can cause bad feelings among neighbours and the wider community.  
The media likes to focus on all these issues. The public at large, even those not attending and  
not interested, can nevertheless gain ‘psychic benefits’ from their vicarious experience of events,  
such as increased community pride and perceptions of economic and other impacts. Our dis-  
cussion of resident perceptions and attitudes, particularly on non-utility values, elaborates on  
these points. See the profile of Sunshine Coast Research in Chapter 8.  
*Protesters and Demonstrators*  
They might be part of an organised group, for example, the protests and demonstrations that  
always seem to accompany international summits and political events, and these groups are  
often accommodated in particular places where they can be visible for media coverage. Their  
experience relates to being part of a group with a purpose, being a form of communitas. But  
because they are in opposition to the main event, or have an unpopular cause \(in the minds of  
the organisers\), there will be tension, and sometimes this degenerates into violence and open  
rioting. To some, the risk element can be an attraction and a stimulus.  
STUDY GUIDE  
This chapter covers business events \(MICE\), educational and scientific, political and state,  
sport, and recreational events from the perspectives of their form, function, and experiences.  
They should be contrasted on these variables with the celebratory events described in the  
previous chapter. In addition, we looked at events at the margin, being unplanned or semi-  
planned, yet related to planned events by reference to experiences, impacts, and management  
issues like safety and security. Consider how this category is evolving in response to the growth  
of social media and virtual reality, and the related phenomenon \(in terms of technology\) of  
citizens as news reporters. The section on stakeholder experiences should lead to a discussion  
of planning, design, evaluation, and impact assessment, as each stakeholder category should  
be treated separately. Event producers and staff cannot be narrowly focused on one segment  
without risking the creation of problems with the others. In particular, students should reflect Business, sPort, and Other Event eXPeriences on their own event experiences as they interact with \(and are possibly interdependent with\)  
other stakeholders.  
135  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Describe and compare the essential differences between each major type of planned event,  
including any fundamental differences in experiences and programmed elements of style  
associated with them\: business and trade events; educational and scientific; political and  
state; sport and recreational; unplanned, or events at the margin.  
l Discuss planning and design implications related to each event stakeholder category, with  
reference to why they should be considered, their roles, and their experiences.  
l In addition to the stakeholder categories described in this chapter, how would you examine  
differences in their experiences related to demographic variables \(e.g., age, gender, family  
status\) or their cultural affiliations?

# Introduction  
This chapter commences with a discussion of policy analysis as it applies to Event Studies. We  
examine the nature of public policy, including its links with power, politics, and ideology. The  
meaning of policy domains and regimes is discussed, as well as governance and legitimacy. In the  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003374251-7 Public PoliCY and Events 137  
second section, we present policy considerations specific to events, followed by a section on  
justifications for public intervention in the event sector, including the concepts of public goods,  
market failure, and efficiency. Then each major policy domain related to planned events receives a  
more detailed examination, covering economic policy \(development, tourism\), social \(leisure,  
sport, health, and well-being\), cultural \(arts\), and the environment. Finally, the chapter con-  
cludes with a look at the policymaking process as applicable to the event sector.  
# The Evolution of Policy Analysis for Events  
According to Foley et al. \(2011\), policy analysis in events research has been very limited. It  
started with a focus on event management and has evolved to encompass the many themes of  
Event Studies. Within that transition, policy analysis has focused on a range of issues, includ-  
ing macro-level contextualisation, policy dimensions, and the impacts of events. The object of  
such analysis is to gain an understanding of how public policy affects the events sector, and this  
has certainly come to the fore with the pandemic and ensuing governmental interventions. It  
is also of critical importance when considering ongoing funding of events, bidding and hosting  
mega-events, and the integration of event-related policies in other important policy fields such  
as health, economic and social development, and cultural and environmental policy.  
In theoretical terms, Hall \(2014\) argued that the political analysis of events reflects the wider  
concern of politics, which is about power and who gets what, where, and how. This is a funda-  
mental concern within welfare studies. In this respect, politics and the analysis of power should  
be a central concern in Event Studies as power shapes public policies and influences the ways  
in which events are developed and staged, and beneficiaries and losers emerge. This is not  
deemed to be a popular pastime for researchers, as it often involves critiquing the very bodies  
funding and hosting events and research. As the field matured, and with prodding from criti-  
cal theorists, it has now been recognised there are many reasons for greater transparency and  
accountability in event research, policy, and practice.  
*Public Policy and Power*  
Public policy consists of a goal-directed process by governments and their agencies, manifested  
in laws, regulations, decisions \(both actions and inaction\), and intentions of governments  
regarding specific problems or general areas of public concern. Policy can be viewed in terms  
of power, because political parties, special interest groups and their professional lobbyists,  
constantly seek to influence policy.  
Political scientists and other researchers can study inequities in who has power, and what inter-  
ests are actually taken into account when event policy is established. Policies of government are  
often based on ideology, arising from party-political manifestos. However, determining what is  
a government’s policy in many cases has to be deduced from what they do, or avoid doing, and  
this might simply reflect the dominant values of society at the time. It might also be difficult to  
discern the rationality behind government actions, and indeed it often appears in many juris-  
dictions that there is no coherent policy on events.  
A policy domain is a broad area of government responsibility or interest, such as culture, the  
economy, the environment, or health, which usually encompasses a variety of departments,  
agencies, laws, regulations, and programmes. Planned events cross a number of policy domains,  
often involving two or three levels of government, so it will be necessary to develop liaison  
between agencies on event-related issues, and to develop integrating policies. 138  
Public PoliCY and Events  
Hall and Rusher \(2004\) noted that the policy dimensions related to events include the  
political nature of the policymaking process, public participation, sources of power, exercise  
of choice by policymakers in a complex environment, and perceptions of the effectiveness  
of policy. To study event policy therefore requires knowledge of the various institutions  
involved, and how they interact and make policy. These include the legislators \(elected  
or otherwise\), government agencies \(such as culture, tourism, sport, and economic devel-  
opment\), the courts, law enforcement, public–private partnerships, quasi-governmental  
organisation, regulators, and other organisations with power, such as trade unions and  
political parties.  
Increasingly cities, regions, and countries are creating event-specific agencies or companies to  
bid on, facilitate or produce events. Unfortunately, public policy gets confusing and perhaps  
becomes counter-productive, when governments delegate authority to so-called independent  
agencies. This can result in secrecy, lack of accountability, and decisions made without regard  
to public needs or preferences.  
Each policy field or domain will involve a different network of stakeholders, yet tourism,  
culture, sports, events, and other networks of agencies and interests overlap considerably.  
Finding one’s way through these networks can be a challenge. Within them, who has power  
and how is it used? Intra- and inter-governmental conflicts, or lack of integration, also influ-  
ence event-related policy. National governments typically promote tourism, but often it is local  
governments who have to provide the infrastructure – it is their voters who feel the immediate  
impacts and often the long-term legacy of debt and overbuilt facilities. Sport and events might  
appear to be perfect partners, but each interest group probably wants something different and  
might fight over resources.  
The concept of policy regimes is of direct relevance, especially when it comes to very big issues  
like hosting mega-events. Richards, de Brito, and Wilks \(2013, 227\) noted that “More recent  
studies of events have also underlined the importance of policy regimes to provide the ‘political will’ necessary  
to derive lasting benefits from events”. A regime could be defined by alliances, networks, and power  
brokers. Often there are elite groups in society that have the ability to make things happen  
because of their collective power. The use of celebrities is a common tactic \(even calling them  
‘ambassadors’\) to influence decision-makers.  
*Ideology*  
Political parties take different approaches to event funding or regulation, and in general to  
culture, economic development, or leisure and sport, based on ideologies. Ideology is rooted  
in philosophies, values, and even religious beliefs. Seldom do political parties engage in  
ideologically based debate over policies towards planned events, but it does happen around  
specific issues and events – especially for spending on mega-events or event venues, and some-  
times regarding the funding of festivals and sports. In terms of ideological differences, observ-  
ers can look for the following indicators of substantial differences between party positions, and  
then assess how they will affect the events sector\:  
l A general belief in government intervention, which leads to many programmes of funding  
as well as to many regulations – versus a general belief in free enterprise, the marketplace,  
and individual rather than collective responsibility.  
l Policies that result in governments taking a proactive lead, versus a problem-solving  
approach \(e.g., formulating pro-event policy, versus merely reacting to issues\). Public PoliCY and Events 139  
l A belief that culture, sport, and leisure are matters of health and public welfare, versus the  
view that they are best left to individual consumption decisions.  
l A belief that tourism is business and best left to the industry, rather than being a social,  
environmental, or cultural issue.  
l Responsiveness to special interest groups \(which reveals power bases\).  
*Governance*  
Dredge and Whitford \(2011\) discussed governance as a form of public–private policymaking  
involving discourse and action among stakeholders towards the achievement of common goals.  
As such, this relates to stakeholder theory and value co-creation networks, to event portfolios  
seeking synergies, and to the engagement of all parties and voices in evaluation and impact  
assessment. While private companies and for-profit entrepreneurs are used to an environment  
in which decisions are made internally, with the company’s goals first and foremost, those  
organisations in the public and not-for-profit sectors are often inclined towards inclusive-  
ness. For the purposes of evaluating or planning inclusive governance, Whitford et al. \(2014\)  
developed a set of indicators covering several important considerations. They recommended  
indicators of transparency, rule of law, responsiveness, equitable involvement, structures and  
processes, and accountability. A related issue, also applicable to policymaking and stakeholder  
management in general, is that of legitimacy. Those in power have one kind, while residents  
and other stakeholder groups might dispute the right of politicians or public agencies to make  
decisions such as bidding on, funding, and hosting events.  
*Legitimation and Legitimacy; Social Licence*  
The legitimation of events as policy tools and instruments of strategy is now global, but indi-  
vidual events and specific actions of companies or governments are often contested. One of  
the reasons for widespread adoption of more inclusive governance models is a lack of trust in  
governments and corporations. The notion of a legitimacy crisis was raised by Habermas \(1975\),  
and it applies wherever and whenever the public or key stakeholders question decisions and  
demand transparency and accountability. Larson, Getz, and Pastras \(2015, 170\) argued that  
festival legitimacy is built and sustained within the culture of a local community, and a festival  
comes to be regarded as an institution in terms of widespread and permanent legitimacy. The  
source of this legitimacy can lie in moral authority, commercial success, legal status, and/or  
strategy. In many ways, this is the same as achieving a social licence.  
The concept of social licence is sometimes raised in the context of events, especially major proj-  
ects related to mega-events. At one level it refers to companies or proponents of events seeking  
public support, above and beyond what is legally required. This is sometimes abused, as in  
attempting to convince the public it will be good for them by emphasising purported benefits  
and ignoring or downplaying the costs and negative impacts. On the other side of the coin,  
certain advocacy groups and narrowly defined lobbies have used the social licence idea to oppose  
and sometimes block projects, by claiming to speak for the public. The fact is, there is no real  
social licence, it is an idea related to public participation and meaningful participation in plan-  
ning and decision-making. It is a reflection of power in politics.  
If events are considered a public good, on par with – or an element in – social, leisure, health,  
sport, and culture policy, then there should be a planning process in place to ensure adequate  
provision, including these elements\: 140  
Public PoliCY and Events  
l Needs assessment; issues identification; multi-stakeholder input.  
l Developing a portfolio of events to meet specific needs in specific places.  
l Setting standards of provision and accessibility.  
l Funding and facilitation programmes tied to public agencies and venues.  
l Organisational development to ensure implementation; community capacity-building.  
l Research, monitoring, and impact evaluation.  
l Review and policy refinement.  
It seems likely that most authorities will not develop such an integrated events policy, but  
within closely related policy domains, the same planning approach can be applied\:  
l Issues \(why are we interested in events? justification for intervention\).  
l Purpose and goals \(what we want to accomplish with events – the desired outcomes\).  
l Research, consultations, and the planning process.  
l Evaluation and accountability \(e.g., performance measures, monitoring, and feedback\).  
l Implementation\: laws and regulations; event development or bidding agencies; event fund-  
ing programmes.  
# Policy Considerations Specific to Events  
Hall and Page \(2006, 335\) identified a number of policy-related considerations that should be  
applied to the events sector. The first is the policy environment, consisting of all those factors that  
shape policy. The basic form of government \(is it democratic?\), the distribution of power, and  
how society is structured are determinants of the policy environment, as are the values of polit-  
ical parties \(i.e., ideology\) reflected in the emphasis on a free market versus interventionism.  
Institutional arrangements are critical, such as the existence of an event development agency or an  
events office within a city where policy for events can be concentrated and made transparent.  
This convenience has to be viewed against the many voices to be heard, and not all of them are  
effective in lobbying. Such a situation introduces the notion of a policy arena in which special  
interest groups engage in lobbying, institutions interact, individuals and groups achieve influ-  
ence, and leadership might or might not be effective.  
The notion of a political market square is pertinent, as the various stakeholders have varying  
degrees of power and influence, form alliances or collaborate, negotiate, and seek to influence  
policy. The openness of this process should be a matter of concern to everyone. In most places,  
the policy arena for events is fractured, consisting of the often-competing voices of sport, arts,  
heritage, culture, and tourism, and further subdivided by professional associations represent-  
ing specific types of events.  
Policies and programmes are formulated for specific purposes, then must be evaluated in terms  
of their impact, effectiveness, and efficiency. The policy should be continuously reviewed and  
improved with full stakeholder input. Finally, there is the important matter of accountability –  
how are officials and others held accountable for their policies and actions?  
In Table 7.1, three levels of government are considered, with typical event-related policies for  
each \(recognising that they can overlap\) and typical evaluation questions. In many countries,  
it is local government that takes most initiatives, setting up event departments, bidding agen-  
cies, or development corporations. In the book Event Portfolio Management \(Antchak, Ziakas, and Public PoliCY and Events 141

Figure 7.1 Strategic Intervention Choices for Governments  
Getz, 2019\) are examples from New Zealand, Australia, England, and Scotland, and a compar-  
ison of 23 cities, internationally, as to their events-related goals and strategies.  
Getz and Frisby \(1991\) developed a framework for local government policymaking in the  
events sector. The logic also applies to other agencies, such as tourism, with their interconnec-  
tion with events. Figure 7.1 gives an overview of the strategic choices.  
The basic premise is that some level of policy intervention in the events sector is desired and  
practical. First, several optional roles have to be considered\:  
l Direct provision\: governmental agencies produce and own events.  
l Equity approach\: do not produce, but invest in events \(in this case equity means the capital  
invested\).  
l Sponsorship\: act like corporations and make sponsorship deals for specific benefits \(such as  
place branding, image-making, and social marketing\).  
l Facilitate\: through various policy initiatives, facilitate event creation or operations.  
The facilitation role leads to various assistance options\:  
l Financial\: grants, loans, lines of credit, debt relief, subsidies \(e.g., for use of police, traffic  
services, venues\), tax relief, awards, and prizes.  
l Technical\: professional advice; training; research and information; office space.  
l Marketing\: overall or event-specific promotions; inclusion in government materials, and  
websites.  
l Regulatory\: fast-tracking; release from onerous obligations.  
l Infrastructure\: provision and improvement of necessary services \(roads, water\) and public  
venues \(e.g., theatres, arenas, parks, and plazas\).  
*Regulating the Events Sector*  
Event producers have to satisfy and manage relationships with numerous regulatory agencies  
and their officials. A majority of these are at the local level, but sometimes multi-level approv-  
als are needed from the following\: Public PoliCY and Events 143  
l Police\: security requirements and police presence  
l Traffic\: accessibility, parking, public transport, and control  
l Fire\: maximum capacity, accessibility and evacuation procedures, and hazardous materials  
l Health and safety\: hazardous materials, fireworks and lasers, food and beverage preparation  
and storage standards, electricity, and waste disposal  
l Building inspection\: standards, inspection of new construction, or allowable temporary  
structures  
l Land use\: where events can be held, where venues can be built, size limits, and site planning  
requirements  
l Noise control\: noise levels and dispersion, hours of operation  
l Labour\: minimum wages, age restrictions, work hours, certification of professionals and  
trades people, and health and safety  
l Environmental\: emission standards \(smoke, pollutants\), recycling, and wastes  
l Consumer protection\: price controls, guarantees, refunds  
*Top-Down Versus Bottom-Up*  
Policymaking for events can range from a top-down approach, led by government or specific  
agencies, to a bottom-up approach, arising from community needs assessments and the input  
of many stakeholders. Event tourism policy tends to be top-down \(as in Australia, as demon-  
strated by Whitford, 2004a, 2004b\), mainly because it is seen as legitimate economic devel-  
opment but also because so much bidding on events is opportunistic. When developing a  
policy open to stakeholder input, a number of collaborative, consensus-building approaches  
can be used. For example, Hall and Rusher \(2004, 225\) gave an example of effective community  
involvement in events policy.  
*Research, Evaluation, and Public Policy*  
What do we need to formulate and effectively administer events-related policy? Both practi-  
tioners and academics have a role to play, not only the policymakers themselves. To analyse  
policy or strategy, one should examine the following\:  
l Intention, or expressed purpose \(is it economic/development-oriented, or community/  
culture-oriented; see the goals and performance criteria\).  
l Contents \(responsibilities of the agencies involved, types of events covered, applicability in  
different settings\).  
l Implementation \(programmes and schedules, funds allocated, regulations, evaluation, and  
accountability\).  
l Results \(multiple, independent evaluations of intended and unintended outcomes and feed-  
back and revisions\).  
*Public Discourse and Policy*  
We cannot expect rational and sustainable decision-making until, and unless, there is a full,  
open, and honest public discourse on events and their costs and impacts. Such a discourse is  
also essential for the institutionalisation of a new paradigm, such as sustainable events or a 144  
Public PoliCY and Events  
triple-bottom-line approach. What gets covered in the press, and the issues talked about by  
residents, constitute important elements in the public discourse. Researchers and practitioners  
have a moral responsibility to engage politicians and the public, in large part by offering evi-  
dence and informed opinions about the impacts of events.  
# Justifying Public Sector Involvement  
At election time, most governments try to justify their policies. They also put forward clearly  
different policy platforms, based on ideology \(or the need for positioning\). Many voters are  
swayed by specific proposals or measures, while others are impressed more by values and  
policies that suggest the general direction a government will take. Veal \(2011\) observed that  
the critical approach to sociological research and theory has raised many public policy ques-  
tions. For example, who is being served by public expenditure on festivals? Probably the most  
obvious public policy that relates to planned events is funding, so what is the case for public  
funding of events? Practice varies widely, with money coming from a variety of public agencies,  
all aimed at different outcomes. Increasing scrutiny of policy, or of government inaction, leads  
to many questions being raised in the media and at the community level.  
The main lines of justification for public funding or other forms of intervention \(like regula-  
tions, direct production of events, or marketing\) start with ideology – namely, what is a public  
good? After that, market failure or market inadequacies are often cited, and achieving greater  
efficiency is also used as justification. When we address possible responses to outcomes and  
the question of “what is an event worth” in Chapter 14, we will be reflecting upon this discus-  
sion of policy justification.  
*Creating Public Good*  
The key to this powerful argument is to demonstrate important benefits from events that  
accrue to society as a whole – or to the economy \(which should ideally benefit us all\) and to  
the environment \(everyone should support a healthier, safer, more sustainable environment\).  
It should also be made clear by policymakers that the benefits from events can only be achieved  
through support and investment in events, or at least that the benefits of events are equal to  
those from other investment opportunities. When backed by research, expert testimony, and  
public opinion surveys showing support for events, the public good argument cannot easily be  
refuted.  
To make the public good argument valid and convincing, the following criteria have to be met\:  
l Events fit into accepted policy domains \(culture, health, and economics\).  
l Public benefits are substantial \(it’s worth our while to get involved\) and inclusive \(everyone  
gains\), and they can be demonstrated or proved.  
l There are rules and accountability for money spent and other actions taken.  
*Social Equity*  
The social equity principle is really a part of the public good justification. In the context of  
planned events, it can be stated this way\: where events provide a public good \(i.e., benefits  
accrue to society as a whole\), it is justifiable for governments to intervene by way of subsidies  
\(to events or participants\) or direct provision of events, in order to ensure that everyone has Public PoliCY and Events 145  
the means to attend or otherwise benefit from events. Social equity literally means that access  
to a public good or service, and to the benefits of public investment, is based on principles of  
fairness, justice, and need. This is not the same as equality, wherein everyone gets exactly the  
same thing. For example, equal access to events or the benefits of events would mean that  
everyone gets the same, but that principle is not widely held to be feasible or desirable.  
Equity is a serious issue for the events sector, particularly because many governments value  
events in the context of culture, social integration, leisure, and health. If left to the free market,  
it is probable that many people will not be able to participate in some events because of high  
costs, inaccessibility, or lack of knowledge about opportunities. While the equity principle jus-  
tifies subsidies and direct provision, the value of events to society can and should be measured.  
Over-development of economic impact assessment has left us weak in demonstrating social  
and cultural value. Sometimes government action related to events directly violates the equity  
principle, for example in the arts sector when heavily subsidised institutions and events \(such  
as symphony, ballet, opera, and theatre\) still charge high ticket prices, making it impossible for  
the poor to attend. One solution is to maintain high nominal prices \(the rich hardly notice it\)  
but to ensure that low-cost tickets are available to those in need. Another is to proactively take  
art and events to the people through free-to-enter concerts and festivals.  
*Failure or Inadequacies of the Marketplace*  
This economic justification for public involvement rests on the premise \(or ideological belief\)  
that economic development in general is best left in the hands of the private sector, but in some  
cases, the free market does not provide sufficient incentive or reward to stimulate entrepre-  
neurial activity or to generate public goods and services. Accordingly, giving money to tourism  
marketing organisations, participating in joint ventures with the private sector, or providing tax  
incentives or subsidies to investors \(including events\), can all be justified as a necessary means  
to achieve public policy aims. This argument is sometimes extended to providing assistance for  
the not-for-profit sector. For example, organisations produce many festivals and other events  
in an inherently risky environment, so they deserve assistance as long as the public good can  
be demonstrated.  
Burgan and Mules \(2001\) and Mules and Dwyer \(2006\) argued that fewer sporting venues  
would be built, and fewer events would occur without public support because market forces  
would not support them. Yet many of the direct benefits accrue to the hospitality and travel  
industry, so why should the public sector intervene? The supply of events would eventually  
reach equilibrium with demand \(i.e., what consumers are willing to pay\) only if a completely  
free market existed. At that equilibrium point, there would theoretically exist the number and  
types of events that were demanded by paying customers. But a relatively free market really  
only exists for certain types of events, namely, those produced by for-profit corporations for  
companies or consumers that are looking for specific entertainment, learning, or marketing  
opportunities that can only be met by these types of events \(perhaps weddings or private par-  
ties\). But most event entrepreneurs have to compete with subsidised events and event venues  
in the public or non-profit domains, which distorts the marketplace.  
The law of the commons\: Culture, public lands and facilities, scenery, and other natural resources  
exploited for tourism and events can be considered common assets. Their benefits should  
accrue to everyone, and they need to be protected. This is the stewardship principle in sustain-  
ability theory and politics. Only government policy and action can protect common assets.  
If common assets are used for tourism or events without regulation, by whoever takes the 146  
Public PoliCY and Events  
initiative, benefits will accrue only to a few, and the resources will potentially be depleted.  
Accordingly, public policy and action are justified on sustainability grounds, not necessarily  
in the form of investment, but at least in the form of regulation and, when needed, rationing.  
*Return on Investment \(ROI\) and Economic Efficiency*  
To private investors, ROI is their measure of value. In other words, for every dollar invested,  
what are their profits or earnings? In the private sector, the ROI will constitute profit, some  
or all of which could be re-invested in the growth of the event or expansion of the business.  
Tourism agencies investing in events often equate economic impact with ROI, focusing on the  
number of dedicated event tourists attracted \(who would not otherwise visit the destination\)  
and what they spent. Strictly speaking, this is one impact, and it does not necessarily equal a  
benefit to everyone.  
Governments and public agencies can also make money. Numerous studies have shown that  
governments at all levels realise substantial tax gains from tourism in general, and event tour-  
ism in particular. Events stimulate consumption of goods and services that are heavily taxed.  
Purely on a profit basis, public sector investment is thereby justified. However, there has to be  
proven feasibility, accountability, and professional management in place.  
The public sector in many countries has engaged in downsizing and outsourcing to save  
the taxpayer money. Really this is a way of saying that the services need to be provided,  
but the private sector can do it more efficiently. Some cities have developed festivals and  
events, then put them out to tender. Publicly funded facilities are sometimes managed for  
profit by private companies that use events to generate both tourism and private profits.  
Efficiency is also gained when events with surplus capacity are marketed to tourists, and  
when events are held in public facilities and spaces that both have surplus capacity and  
need additional revenue. In these cases, spending a little on events can realise important  
benefits for residents.  
*Intangible Benefits\: Psychic and Existence Values*  
Psychic benefits accrue to people when they value something more than its related costs, as was  
calculated in the landmark event impact study by Burns et al. \(1986\). Those researchers deter-  
mined that the Adelaide Grand Prix imposed costs and problems on the resident population,  
but a large majority still thought the event was desirable and should be held again. In other  
words, it had a psychic value for them which was at least equal to the monetary value of all those  
personal and community-felt costs. Only an economist would make such a claim!  
Consumer surplus\: An event \(or other experience\) can be worth more than people have to pay for  
it, generating a consumer surplus. This is a value that governments and service organisations  
can create deliberately by providing free events or subsidising segments such as the elderly or  
disadvantaged. To economists, the value that consumers assign to a purchase or experience can  
be measured by their willingness to pay. Their utility value \(i.e., benefits gained from the event\)  
might be higher than the cost, or the value of the resources consumed to produce the event.  
This approach to valuation is difficult, given that people are possibly unable or unwilling to talk  
about hypotheticals like “what would you pay if…?” In many cases \(seeing as it is a hypothet-  
ical research exercise\), people will say they will not pay anything for a currently free good or  
service, or they will not pay more than it currently costs, because they do not want to see fees  
or taxes go up. That is very rational behaviour. Public PoliCY and Events 147  
Armbrecht \(2014\), Andersson and Lundberg \(2013\) and Andersson and Armbrecht \(2014\)  
detailed the theory behind contingent valuation and its application to determining various use  
and non-use values attributable to events. Research clearly reveals that people value events  
even if they do not attend them, as events provide real leisure choices, preserve traditions,  
and enrich communities in different ways. Bequest value pertains to the roles events can play in  
preserving traditions \(to be passed on to future generations\) but might also relate to the value  
of certain events for youth \(the next generation\). Option value clearly stems from the choices  
events provide, and most people would agree that communities without events would be very  
boring. Existence value covers the range of possible social, economic cultural, and environmental  
benefits that events can bring to communities. However, just because people recognise these  
values does not necessarily mean they are happy to see governments, lavish money on them or  
to have their taxes raised to support them – that is a subject for public discourse and political  
decision-making \(see the Sunshine Coast Research profiled in Chapter 8\).  
*Counter-Arguments*  
Counter-arguments are also heard. Money given to special interest groups often attracts oppo-  
sition, especially from groups that do not get similar treatment. Sometimes there are strong  
cultural or political forces opposing government spending on projects that are claimed to be  
elitist \(e.g., performing arts that are subsidised, yet too expensive for most people to buy  
tickets\), harmful \(risky sports, and especially sports featuring animals\), perverse \(LGBTQ+  
are often attacked\) or narrow \(i.e., the benefits accrue only to private companies\). A lack of  
involvement with tourism or events might occur because attention is turned elsewhere, as in  
the pandemic. And because governments are faced with virtually unlimited spending oppor-  
tunities, and limits on resources, they have to constantly prioritise. It is certainly reasonable  
for policymakers and political parties to say they have more important priorities than planned  
events, but that is not very convincing when policy already exists for directly related domains  
like sport, the arts, tourism, and economic development.

the period 2015–2025, and in 2023 was again under review through public, industry,  
and government consultations. *“It looks to use and develop Scotland’s assets to deliver*  
*a portfolio of events that provide world leading authentic experiences for Scotland’s*  
*residents and visitors”* \(source\: www.visitscotland.org\). 148  
Public PoliCY and Events  
This statement is from Visit Scotland \(2015, 8\)\:  
*Wide consultation has informed the development of this strategy. Input has been*  
*drawn from across the industry, from industry representative groups including the*  
*Scottish Events and Festivals Association \(SEFA\), the National Outdoor Events As-*  
*sociation \(Scotland\) \(NOEA Scotland\) and the Edinburgh Festivals Forum to the*  
*organisers of individual events of all types and sizes, from visitor attractions to sup-*  
*pliers and from national sports associations and governing bodies to destination*  
*management organisations.*  
The strategy explicitly aims to develop and manage a full portfolio of events, with the  
following characteristics\:  
–  
an annual core of events unique to Scotland, embedded in Scottish culture, plus  
–  
–  
business events.  
high-profile recurring and one-off events including mega-events to complement  
the core portfolio.  
impact and legacy delivered on an ongoing basis through education,  
entertainment, and event experiences – both for residents and for visitors.  
The most significant mega-event held since the plan was instituted was the Glasgow  
Commonwealth Games of 2014. Post-event, many research articles have been pub-  
lished pertaining to a wide variety of issues \(a phenomenon associated with all one-time  
mega-events\) such as the following examples pertaining to impacts on the city itself,  
both image and infrastructure \(new facilities\), volunteerism and health, and sustainability.

Current Issues  
Scotland’s cultural identity and heritage have been recognised as strong differentiating  
factors, alongside friendliness, natural beauty, heritage and architecture, sports, and  
festivals. Effort has been substantial in promoting the image of the nation as an events  
destination, but in 2023 a number of serious issues were threatening its competitive-  
ness. In addition to the negative effects of the pandemic, which especially harmed  
festivals and cultural institutions through cancellations and postponements, Scotland  
was experiencing high costs, supply chain difficulties, rising wages, new restrictions  
on alcohol marketing, and new environmental regulations, all of which impacted on  
the tourism and events sectors. International competitiveness was under threat, with  
other destinations investing heavily in events and related infrastructure. The current Public PoliCY and Events 149  
strategy for the period 2021–2024 includes the following\: \(source\: https\://www.gov.  
scot/publications/national-events-strategy-review-consultation/\)  
*Purpose\: To deliver a strategic and coordinated approach to supporting the rebuild-*  
*ing of the visitor economy in a responsible way, to ensure that tourism thrives.*  
*Vision\: Scotland is a leader in 21st century tourism with a thriving, responsible visitor*  
*economy.*  
*Mission\: Through strategic leadership and industry partnerships, encourage a re-*  
*sponsible approach to re-building and growing the value of tourism highlighting the*  
*benefits of tourism and events across Scotland in delivering the very best for our*  
*visitors, our businesses, our people, our communities and our environment.*  
A number of actions are being discussed\:  
– building a responsible destination brand.  
– investing in Scotland’s tourism and events communities.  
–  
Facilitating collaboration and embracing change in support of a fairer, more  
responsible, and inclusive visitor economy.  
– action plan for visitor management.  
– agritourism strategy.  
– destination climate action plan.  
– tourism development framework.  
Other issues being addressed include\:  
– equality, inclusion, and diversity, including poverty, age, race, disability, sexual  
orientation, socio-economics, the islands \(remoteness\); well-being and mental  
health.  
–  
Partnership and Collaboration\: with communities; technology and infrastructure;  
educational institutions.  
– best practice, Innovation, and Continuous Improvement\: fair work and workforce  
development; skills; voluntarism; environmental and financial sustainability.  
– best practice in measurement \(see the EventImpacts website and toolkit at\:  
https\://www.eventimpacts.com/\). This website contains a tool for estimating an  
event’s direct economic impact and a number of case studies and reports of  
value to anyone looking at event impacts.  
– excellent Event Experience\: inclusiveness; audience and community engagement;  
variety.  
– delivering a Shared Ambition\: role of the strategy.  
–  
Promotion and Profile\: reputation and brand; promotion through events; the role  
of mega-events.  
Edinburgh\: Festival City  
Edinburgh is frequently cited as an example of a festival city, with its brand and tourism  
sector being closely associated with a portfolio of successful annual events. In the book  
*Event Portfolio Management* \(Antchak, Ziakas, and Getz, 2019\), there is a detailed 150  
Public PoliCY and Events  
Plate 7.1 Edinburgh Fringe Festival\: Crowd and Performers on the Royal Mile  
*Photo Credit\:* Edinburgh Festival Fringe - Daniel Clarke, Festivals Edinburgh  
examination of the collaboration and networking that goes into the city’s events,  
alongside national-level planning and support from Scotland’s various ministries. The  
book *Event Impact Assessment* \(Getz, 2019a\) presents highlights from a succession of  
impact studies that Festivals Edinburgh has placed online.  
The website https\://www.edinburghfestivalcity.com/ provides a huge amount of useful  
information for exploring the festivals as well as the organisations behind them, and  
in particular the organisation Festivals Edinburgh. See Plate 7.1 for a photo of the  
Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  
According to Antchak, Ziakas, and Getz \(2019\), the success of Edinburgh illustrates  
several important points for event portfolio creation, management, and strategy all of  
which can be called a festival ecosystem\:  
l Portfolio management is being implemented at three levels\: nation, city, and festival  
programming.  
l Eleven major Edinburgh festivals have a formal organisation and can be considered  
a managed portfolio.  
l Common goals and integrated action with regard to vision, policy, strategy, and  
funding.  
l Collaboration among key stakeholders is both formal and informal; networking pro-  
cedures are well established. Public PoliCY and Events 151  
l Strategic planning and research have facilitated innovation and competitiveness.  
l Synergies are fostered with regard to achieving desired benefits in the fields of  
branding, communications, financing, venues, and the engagement of residents.  
According to Visit Scotland’s 2015 visitor survey \(cited in boP Consulting, 2018, 8\),  
“Edinburgh’s Festivals each year deliver over 3,000 events, reaching audiences of more  
than 4.5 million and creating the equivalent of approximately 6,000 full time jobs. 32%  
of the 14 million+ annual visitors to Scotland are motivated by the nation’s cultural and  
heritage offer, in which the Festivals play a defining role”.  
The Festivals Forum was established in 2007 following the first of several reports called  
Thundering Hooves. It exists to facilitate collaboration, particularly between major  
funders and events and venues. Festivals Edinburgh is the formal, staffed association of  
the 11 major, permanent festivals. Leadership is shared. As well, the City of Edinburgh  
and the Scottish Government work closely together with the association.  
The festival ecosystem works at the national, city, and event levels, encompassing  
the Scottish event. portfolio, of which the city’s event portfolio. Common goals and  
vision, and the integration of policy and plans, are inherent benefits of this eco-  
system approach – including dedicated funding programmes. Also important have  
been a series of research reports and strategy-related documents that seek to fos-  
ter innovation, competitiveness, and relevance to residents. Synergies are evident  
in branding, communications, financing, venues, and the engagement of residents.  
The additional tourism orientation of the portfolio is accepted by the festivals and is  
vitally important to the city and nation.  
Festivals Edinburgh’s mission statement\: ‘To be the world’s leading festival city by sup-  
porting the collective cultural and financial health of Edinburgh’s Festivals’. \(source\:  
https\://www.edinburghfestivalcity.com/about\)  
The Thundering Hooves analysis and resulting strategy for Edinburgh festivals came  
about through collaboration by the Scottish Government, EventScotland, Scottish  
Enterprise, Creative Scotland, and the City of Edinburgh Council. The first report was  
in 2006 and the second was in 2015. The 2006 Thundering Hooves led directly to the  
establishment of the Festivals Forum, an action intended to maintain the city’s global  
competitive advantage related to its festivals. The reports can be found at\: \(https\://  
www.edinburghfestivalcity.com/about/documents/196-thundering-hooves\).  
From the 2006 report\:  
*This study was commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council in partnership with Fes-*  
*tivals Edinburgh \(formerly, the Association of Edinburgh Festivals\), the City of Edin-*  
*burgh Council \(CEC\), the Scottish Executive, EventScotland and Scottish Enterprise*  
*Edinburgh and Lothian. Its purpose is to examine the competitive position of the*  
*eleven festivals belonging to Festivals Edinburgh....*  
Pandemic Impacts  
Cancellations during the pandemic resulted in huge financial losses for the city and  
nation, although funds were provided to help cultural organisations survive the loss 152  
Public PoliCY and Events  
of revenue. The break from business-as-usual did force many in the city and festivals  
network to rethink assumptions and commit to innovation. A study by Ali-Knight et al.  
\(2023\) suggested the pandemic resulted in *“...more innovative festival delivery models*  
*and a different imagining of the festival space”.* The authors proposed a new model of  
risk management focused on *‘Respond, Resilience and Reimagine’.*

# Major Policy Domains and Event-Related Goals  
In this section, major policy domains are discussed with regard to implications for the events  
sector. In particular, we provide sets of goals that are relevant and desirable in order to be com-  
prehensive and foster sustainability. These goals are again important when the discussion turns  
to evaluation and impact assessment. Accompanying tables \(starting with 7.2\) list important  
goals, related policy initiatives for the various levels of government, and key performance indi-  
cators \(KPIs\). Note that Initiatives and KPIs do not necessarily align with one particular goal,  
a more integrative approach is always recommended. Public PoliCY and Events 153

*Economic Policy and Events*  
Economic policy has dominated when it comes to event tourism and the roles events play in  
development and place marketing, to the extent that in many jurisdictions support for events  
has been contingent upon attracting tourists or generating favourable publicity for the city or  
region. This economic bias has undoubtedly benefitted some organisations and events at the  
expense of others and has given rise to its own vocabulary with terms such as hallmark, des-  
tination, and major event becoming prevalent. Sport events and business events have gained  
substantially from public sector investment in arenas, stadia, convention and exhibition cen-  
tres, and the bidding and marketing necessary to fill them. Arts and cultural events benefit  
from investment in theatres and festival places. Increasingly, such investment decisions made  
by governments are influenced by consideration of multiple-use so that sport, entertainment,  
and community uses can be maximised.  
Many of the points made in Table 7.2 are discussed more fully in Chapter 15.  
*Cultural Policy and Events*  
Cultural policy relates mostly to festivals and the arts, but there is no reason why all planned  
events cannot facilitate cultural experiences and meet other cultural development goals \(see  
Table 7.3\). For example, conventions often include local cultural performances or heritage-related  
tours, and at the most basic level, all assemblies can feature local food and beverages. 154

Financial feasibility and

The effectiveness of events as  
attractions to cultural precincts  
A number of studies have examined the aims or mandates of festivals and events. A survey of  
Irish festivals \(Goh, 2003\) asked organisers to indicate and prioritise their aims, revealing that  
the top goal was to promote artistic excellence. This was followed very closely by increasing  
tourism and area promotion \(both place marketing goals\). Other aims \(in descending order\)  
were to showcase local heritage or arts, boost the local economy and celebration, and encour-  
age social inclusion and education.  
Development in the arts and cultural domains has to encompass increased awareness of what is  
available, and its benefits to the community, audience-building through direct involvement of  
people in the arts, generating revenue \(such as by facilitating corporate sponsorship and target-  
ing grants\), fostering traditional or indigenous talent and expression, and even providing free  
entertainment for the public. Radbourne \(2002\) observed that the most common argument for  
government involvement is that “arts and cultural activity enrich a society and that all people have the  
right of access and participation”. Because public benefits are generated \(although these are fre-  
quently in dispute\), and because the private sector will not provide the necessary supply \(this  
being a failure of the marketplace\), direct government action is needed. Basically, this is the  
social equity argument – that many people cannot afford access to the arts without government  
intervention.  
Claims have been growing that the arts and cultural activity in general make for an attrac-  
tive living and working environment, stimulating innovation and competitive advantage \(e.g.,  
Florida, 2002 and the ‘creative economy’\). All events can provide cultural experiences through  
appropriate theming and programming. There is no reason why business and political events  
cannot provide cultural experiences for visitors, such as through authentic entertainment,  
meaningful host–guest interactions, interpretation, and additional pre- or post-cultural  
opportunities. Public PoliCY and Events 155

*Social Policy and Events*  
Social policy covers a wide range of issues, as indicated in this section \(see Table 7.4\). Needs  
vary a great deal, but there are commonalities that should be addressed in every jurisdiction.  
Foster social integration\: In many communities, including small towns and city neighbourhoods,  
events can be catalysts for community development. Their organisation and revenue-making  
potential can foster self-sufficiency and pride in accomplishment. Community identity and  
pride can be heightened through sharing with outsiders. Integration of diverse or conflicted  
social groups should be a specific aim, to be realised through planning and decision-making,  
all the way through social interaction and interpretation at events.  
Public services and resources provided to events \(e.g., police, fire, traffic control, transport,  
physical infrastructure\) are often viewed as expenses to be recovered but should be provided  
within the context of social and cultural policy. In many cases, direct provision of events, and  
subsidies for using public services, are warranted. Who should have access to public spaces and  
venues? Many governments licence all events and ban or shut down informal gatherings, but  
does this policy always serve social goals? It can certainly be argued that in a free society, peo-  
ple have the right to assemble and hold spontaneous events, although this has to be balanced  
by responsible behaviour.  
Combat social problems\: What constitutes anti-social behaviour versus permissible civil dis-  
obedience? Preventing and reacting to social problems at or surrounding events is a matter of  
social policy. It is not just a security issue but should integrate public awareness and education,  
event management including crowd controls, venue design, and public transport.  
Leverage events for urban renewal\: Mega-events in particular are viewed as opportunities for  
large-scale redevelopment or urban renewal projects. Cities create tangible legacies in terms of 156  
Public PoliCY and Events  
monuments and landmarks, culture and entertainment precincts, fresh design and aesthetics,  
and hopefully renewed residential value. History has demonstrated that these benefits must  
be planned in advance, not left to chance, and that events can be both a powerful planning and  
renewal tool and an agent for destruction and inequality. Mules \(1993\) pointed out the roles of  
events in urban renewal strategies, a theme which has since been expanded to include urban  
economic and social revitalisation and repositioning from a branding perspective \(e.g., Duig-  
nan, 2013\). Pugh and Wood \(2004\) examined multiple reasons for event support in London,  
including place marketing, pride, and economic development. Cultural development is also a  
well-explored theme, particularly in the context of cities of culture \(Richards, 2007; Richards  
and Palmer, 2010\).  
Use events to enhance health and wellness\: Events can be used as social marketing tools \(requir-  
ing education and thematic interpretation\) and to provide activities for encouraging healthy  
lifestyles. There will be direct tie-ins to sport, parks, and recreation. Examples include food  
and beverage festivals with nutritional themes, sport competitions stressing safe play, and  
edutainment events in parks. Health concerns and regulations have to be applied across the  
spectrum of events and event venues, so why not make them proactive to encourage health  
and wellness?  
Community resilience\: Derrett \(2008, 107\) produced a model to show how festivals can develop  
community resilience, defined as the “future capacity of that community to meet challenges that might  
beset them”. The key elements in the process are participation \(collaboration, engagement from  
multiple stakeholders\), governance \(leadership, learning\), and the nature and context of the  
event. The aims are to foster social/cultural well-being, environmental sustainability, and eco-  
nomic prosperity. In effect, events are a catalyst in this complex process of community and eco-  
nomic development, in a triple-bottom-line approach. All this should be viewed in the context  
of development of a sense of place and community.  
Social marketing\: Many uses of events as policy instruments can be considered as social mar-  
keting, designed to change attitudes and behaviour of the public – for the better. The focus is  
on populations, not individuals, and positive results can be very difficult to prove. Probably  
the best-known examples are from the health policy domain, particularly stop-smoking cam-  
paigns. When events are intended to change attitudes and behaviour, new research methods  
and measures will be required. Lefebvre \(2011\) outlined a social marketing approach focused  
on audiences. The four rings of the model have audiences in the middle, and it is essential  
to specify what are the benefits to the target audience. Benefits should tap into deep moti-  
vations. The social context must be understood, both with regard to current attitudes and  
desired behaviours, and both determinants and consequences of attitudes and behaviour.  
Methods of branding and positioning should be used to communicate the ideal, in terms  
that the target audience find appealing. It has to mean something positive to them, such  
as health, pride, happiness, and well-being. The full marketing mix can then be employed,  
including economic and non-economic aspects of price \(such as the cost of social problems  
in a community\).  
*Environmental Policy and Events*  
Environmental management is covered in Chapter 13, including a discussion of sustainability  
and ecological processes. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations \(https\://  
sdgs.un.org/goals\) have been incorporated into Table 1.1. See also Table 13.2 where the full range  
of possible environmental actions related to events at the city or destination level are outlined. Public PoliCY and Events 157  
The precautionary principle comes up whenever sustainability is discussed, but it is controversial.  
Some people believe that if we can anticipate that an event might cause negative impacts, we  
should not produce it. This is an extreme view, as it can be misused to preclude just about any  
activity or development. In the same way, the principle of no irreversible change is open to con-  
siderable misuse as a way to prevent desired and necessary action. The fact is that almost any  
development results in irreversible changes.  
Finally, we have to remember economic externalities. A logical response to the externality prob-  
lem is to require that polluters pay for their actions, and that anyone causing public costs should  
be held accountable. If this principle gets applied uniformly it will mean that no event organiser  
will be able to ignore costs and impacts that extend beyond the event. However, this principle  
can also be abused. Consider that events often result in traffic congestion, albeit temporarily,  
and some people not attending the event might lose time and money as a consequence. Should  
they be compensated by the event organisers? What about people impacted by event-caused  
noise? Certainly, it is important to consider all these costs and benefits in the feasibility study  
and in post-event evaluations, but it is also important to realise that society is almost always  
paying some price for economic activity – we tolerate congestion and noise as a normal con-  
sequence of living in cities and fostering economic growth. The same argument applies to any  
event that provides a public good – we should be willing to collectively tolerate some degree of  
inconvenience or amenity loss in pursuit of social and cultural growth. To what extent we toler-  
ate them, and how we deal with externalities, is a matter of debate and public decision-making.  
Economic tools exist for influencing the marketplace and fostering sustainable development.  
Price mechanisms generally work well, either using high prices to discourage consumption  
or subsidised prices to encourage it. If society believes that attending cultural festivals is a  
form of sustainable development, but participation in off-road motorcycle races is not, price  
manipulation can be made through differential taxation, subsidies, or other means. Still more  
effective, of course, is direct prevention of undesirable events through licensing or other regu-  
latory devices. Visitors should be made aware of green operations and sustainability principles  
applied to the event they are attending, and they could also be informed of how to extend these  
actions to their home and work settings as a social marketing strategy. Events with explicit  
environmental themes have been growing in number, including global movements like Earth  
Day and interest-specific themes like bird watching.  
STUDY GUIDE  
It is important for all event stakeholders to understand the policy environment in which they  
operate, and in studying the contents of this chapter it should be remembered that events are  
heavily regulated, often produced, subsidised, or fostered by governments, generally expected to  
meet diverse policy goals, and are routinely subjected to intense public scrutiny within a political  
environment. The nature of public policy was discussed at the beginning of this chapter, leading  
to an exploration of how public involvement in the events sector can be justified. Specifically, this  
included the public good argument and equity principle, which are linked to ideology, and, borrow-  
ing from economics, the failure of the marketplace justification. Additional justification is related  
to efficiency, as in getting the most out of public infrastructure and venues, and the intangible or  
psychic benefits that accrue to people even if they do not attend events. Increasingly events, and  
especially funding decisions and bidding on mega-events are highly political in nature. When  
answering the study questions keep in mind the potential for controversy, scrutiny \(via impact  
assessments and external evaluations\), and how power gets used in the political arena. 158  
Public PoliCY and Events  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l What is public policy?  
l Define policy domains and policy regimes.  
l How is governance related to ownership and planning within an event organisation?  
l Explain how governmental intervention in the event sector can be justified, including the  
public good and equity arguments, market failure, and efficiency.  
l What are the main options for governments, at different levels, when intervening in the  
events sector?  
l Discuss economic, social, cultural, and environmental policy domains as they pertain to  
planned events. Give examples of major possible goals, related policy initiatives, and perfor-  
mance measures.  
l What factors are important in shaping the policymaking process for events? Include ideol-  
ogy and institutional arrangements.  
l What does governance mean in the context of collaboration for the co-creation of value?  
How is this related to legitimacy?  
l Compare the research from Sunshine Coast \(from Chapter 8\) with the Scotland and Edin-  
burgh profile to help you answer this question\: “What kinds of research should inform  
public policymaking for events”?  
l In the environmental domain, should the precautionary principle be applied? How? \(Hint\:  
see also the discussion of sustainability in Chapter 13\).

# Introduction  
This chapter commences with a discussion of the nature of management and how event man-  
agement is unique. Generic management functions are detailed, the first of which is covered in  
this chapter, being Organising and Coordination. This function includes ownership and gover-  
nance, structure, organisational culture, stakeholder management, and institutionalism. An open  
systems model is illustrated and discussed, with relevance to the entire management system  
of events. Ensuing chapters cover the remaining management functions, as follows\: Chapter 9  
covers Directing, defined broadly to include leadership, decision-making, organisational culture,  
and policy, with its second major part examining human resource management, event-related  
education, and careers. Separate chapters are then provided for the functions of planning and

operations \(Chapter 10\), and design \(Chapter 11\). In Chapter 12, the interrelated topics of  
antecedents, marketing, and communications are discussed. Chapter 13 combines risk, safety,  
security, health, and environmental management. Chapter 14 combines evaluation and impact  
assessment, then Chapter 15 deals with event tourism. This sequence is repeated in Table 8.2.  
# Defining Management and Management Theory  
The most basic definitions of management in dictionaries refer to the act or art of managing,  
which implies it is not necessarily a scientific process – it involves judgement and creativity.  
The Latin root is manus, meaning hand, and we often see this reflected in expressions like  
“hands-on management”. People, places, events, destinations, governments, armies, and even  
informal organisations are managed, the minimum being decisions on how resources are used  
to achieve goals. There are different emphases when it comes to business management as  
opposed to, say, managing a problem or policy. The people in charge, making key decisions, are  
also referred to as the management. Let’s explore the terminology in more detail.  
To manage means being in charge, or controlling something. A connotation often heard is this\: to  
manage is to get by, succeed, or accomplish something – a usage that can include the expression  
“They managed to get the event delivered on time”. This usage might imply luck, or “flying by  
the seat of your pants”, neither of which is taught in management schools. The adverb managing  
is similar, requiring context to determine if the person or group in question is just getting by, or is  
really competent. Managing can certainly be used in a neutral sense, merely describing a process.  
As a noun, management usually refers to the direction and control of the organisation \(or event\),  
but we also use the term to describe, collectively, the people in charge. In its adjectival form,  
managed refers to what is being controlled or directed, such as the event’s resources.  
Professional management is universal, and not just taught in management or business schools. All  
applied fields of study and all areas of professional practice incorporate management fundamentals,  
with differing degrees of emphasis. Four spheres of management that are applicable to events \(profit,  
not-for-profit, public sector events, and the management of destinations\) are covered in this book.  
Describing management theory is problematic, as it is open to interpretation as to scope and  
contents. Kessler \(2013, xxv\), the editor of the Encyclopedia of Management Theory, stated  
that management, as it is commonly defined in the context of organisations, embodies the  
management functions of\:  
…Orientation and direction, coordination and control, authority and responsibility,  
planning and design, and administration and implementation…It should therefore be of  
little surprise that there are countless “theories” \(loosely defined as well as loosely connected\)  
of management.  
As a reference, the Encyclopedia of Management Theory \(edited by Eric H. Kessler, SAGE  
Publications, 2013\), with about 280 cross-referenced entries, can be somewhat overwhelming.  
Yet it does not fully answer a critical question\: what are ALL the theories that can inform event  
management? That is largely because economics was excluded, and marketing was barely men-  
tioned. Many management theories are also rooted in sociology and other disciplines, but they  
are absent from the Encyclopedia.  
Kessler posed 18 questions that he believed delimited management theory, and Table 8.1 sum-  
marises and adapts them to guide event management and event tourism. Together they consti-  
tute a very big picture of professional practice and an ambitious research agenda that should be Event Management Fundamentals 161  
read in conjunction with Chapter 16. We try to answer most of these questions in the chapters  
of this book, but Further Readings are going to be needed for readers to address all of them.  
Also, read these questions in conjunction with the research agenda in the concluding chapter.

# Unique Aspects of Event Management  
There are two event-specific sources, EMBOK and MBECS, as guides to specific event manage-  
ment functions. EMBOK, the Event Management Body of Knowledge was created by Julia Silvers,  
Glen Bowdin, William O’Toole, and Kathy Nelson in 2006 to codify the skills and knowledge  
required by professional event managers. The EMBOK model illustrated in Figure 8.1 is in the  
public domain. There are five main knowledge domains in EMBOK\: administration; design;  
marketing; operations, and risk. Each of these has subdivisions. Much of the knowledge base is  
generic, however, the managerial and problem-solving skills needed by event professionals are  
stressed. It tells academics what a full degree programme in event management should cover,  
but the means of acquiring all the pertinent skills and knowledge has to include on-the-job  
experience. With the emphasis on organising, managing, people interaction, and operational  
issues, many event management curricula are underpinned by substantive placement elements  
\(i.e., hands-on experience\) and industry involvement in the delivery and production of content.  
EMBOK also has implications for licensing and cross-border job mobility.  
Figure 8.1 shows the five main knowledge domains, with sub-categories. A second EMBOK  
model on the website \(https\://embok.org/\) specifies core values\: creativity; strategic \(think-  
ing, acting\); continuous improvement; ethics; integration; and processes \(assess; select; mon-  
itor; communicate; document\). Finally, the phases of initiation, planning, implementation,  
event, and closure are modifiers affecting required knowledge and skills.  
Standards prepared for the meetings industry have been developed, called Meeting and Business  
Events Competency Standards \(MBECS\), and they have been reviewed by Cecil et al. \(2013\).  
Professional standards of this kind provide the basis for curriculum design and continuous  
learning. They do not \(like EMBOK and other body-of-knowledge systems\) actually provide the

knowledge or skills, as that role falls to educators, books and other available resources, on-the-  
job training, and other real-life experiences.  
The MBECS standards were developed to show the broad range of knowledge and abilities  
required of those who work in the meeting industry. They do not describe the competencies  
of one occupation, rather all of the competencies required of professionals in the field  
of meeting management at all levels of responsibility.  
\(source\: https\://www.mpi.org\)  
MBECS includes 12 management functions, all of which are discussed in this book. Table  
8.2 draws on EMBOK, MBECS, and various interpretations of generic management functions,  
emphasising additional and special considerations within the professional practice of event  
management and event tourism. This figure is also a guide to where the management functions  
are covered in this book. Event Tourism is considered to be a special case, related to the unique  
challenges of destination management.

# Organising and Coordination  
This section covers the first of the major management functions, combining ownership, gov-  
ernance and mandate, organisational structure, financial management, authority and admin-  
istration, inter-organisational relationships \(including stakeholders\), organisational ecology,  
and the interrelated elements of organisational evolution and the institutionalisation process.  
Essentially, this is where most events begin – within larger organisations or organisations set  
up specifically to produce one or more events. Informal events do exist, usually by way of spon-  
taneous, unplanned happenings. It will be rare to find a planned event that does not start with,  
or evolve quickly into a formal organisation.  
*Ownership, Governance, and Mandate*  
It is possible to produce events informally, with no owners and no structure – just volunteers  
getting it done. But most planned events are formally structured, meaning they have legal own-  
ers, governance is firmly established, and a mandate is provided by their owners or founders. In  
other words, they have purpose, managers, goals, and limits. We begin with several definitions.  
Ownership\: Except for unplanned events, there will always be a legal form of ownership according  
to the laws of particular countries. Owners hold responsibility for the actions of organisations,  
including their financing and governance, and may be held responsible for any debts that occur  
or harm done. Private ownership may involve several forms, including fee-simple – owned by  
one person or copreneurs \(i.e., a couple or family\) – multiple shareholders, or publicly traded on  
a stock exchange. Ownership in the private sector can be sold, and investors can be attracted.  
Both private and not-for-profit organisations can go bankrupt. As described below, we usually  
consider events as being in the public, not-for-profit or private sectors. Not-for-profits are often  
classified legally as institutions and may also have charitable status for tax purposes. That means  
no person makes a profit, but employees can be paid.  
Ownership can also refer to the perception of control, such as a group or community feeling  
ownership of their events. This is often desired by managers, particularly because it aids in  
recruiting volunteers and sponsors, and is necessary when events are conceived as agents of  
change. 168  
Event Management Fundamentals  
Governance\: Put simply, governance is how owners manage and control an organisation, includ-  
ing the establishment of boards of directors, executive officers, lines of authority, policies, and  
procedures. It also refers to the governance of a nation, whether democratic with free elections,  
or not, and is often used to describe how events work with stakeholders or the community.  
A broader interpretation can be applied to communities, governmental jurisdictions, or part-  
nerships in which any or all of the following principles or norms are adhered to\: accountabil-  
ity, transparency, inclusiveness, and responsiveness. These values are typically only found in  
democratic societies. Dredge and Whitford \(2011\) viewed governance as a form of public/  
private policymaking that requires stakeholders to get together for discussion and action to  
achieve common goals. This approach embodies the notion of collaboration and the process of  
consensus-building. Stakeholder management, discussed later, is an essential element in this  
kind of governance.  
In for-profit companies, there are owners and employees, so the question of who runs the busi-  
ness is generally clear. Owners and senior managers have defined responsibilities, and although  
they may consult and work with staff and volunteers, in the end, they must make decisions and  
be held accountable. In governmental agencies, there can be a confusing and stifling bureau-  
cracy to navigate when it comes to obtaining resources and making decisions. Politics intervene  
frequently, making rational planning more difficult. Within not-for-profit organisations the  
relationships between boards of directors and professional staff have to be sorted. Who sits  
on the board is a major issue, especially in relation to involving key stakeholders and getting  
necessary professional advice such as legal and accounting. In all-volunteer events, governance  
and coordination present special challenges, and the organisations can be faced with dissenting  
opinions within, or takeover attempts by organised interest groups within or external.  
Mandate\: The organisation’s mandate is authorisation \(or a requirement\) to produce or assist  
events. This might be implicit in the name, such as when an organisation calls itself the festival  
of something, or in a unit established within an agency, such as Event Marketing Group, but  
ideally, it should be spelled out in detail as to the exact nature of the tasks, resources provided,  
and limits set on their operations. Within a private company this is less important, as the  
underlying mandate \(usually\) is to make a profit, and the owners and investors can decide  
how – that being their business model for creating value. There are three common ownership  
types found in the events world, although public–private partnerships are also popular, and  
they might require special legal incorporation.  
1 not-for-profit\: this large sector includes clubs, charities, institutions, and event-specific  
organisations like festival societies  
2 government agencies \(such as parks and recreation, sport, arts and culture, tourism, and  
economic development\) that produce, market or otherwise facilitate events  
3 private, for-profit companies that produce and/or manage events  
Andersson and Getz \(2009\) systematically compared festivals in four countries in terms of  
their ownership, governance, structure, and content. They concluded that although the festi-  
vals offered a similar product and had similar mandates, they differed considerably in terms of  
revenue sources, cost structure, use of volunteers, corporate sponsorship, and decision-making.  
These differences are potentially important to destinations that view festivals as attractions and  
use them in place marketing. There has been little research published on the relative advan-  
tages or problems associated with these ownership types, or the business models they follow  
to provide their products and services as a way to co-create value. One important question to  
be addressed is whether or not these three structures or models of ownership are substitutable. Event Management Fundamentals 169  
For example, in some countries, local authorities are the dominant producers of festivals and  
other events. Legal and cultural constraints exist, especially in societies without a strong vol-  
unteering or entrepreneurial tradition.  
The public sector  
Governments do not have to obey the laws of the marketplace, they can create, facilitate and  
subsidise events for a multitude of reasons and not worry about profits or break-event points –  
except when it comes to explaining their actions to voters. Our discussion of public goods,  
equity, and the failure of the marketplace, provide justifications. Since many events are pro-  
duced by, or subcontracted by government departments and agencies, some attention to public  
administration is required in Event Studies. If the event functions as a programme within a  
governmental agency, then it is clearly an instrument of policy. Under some circumstances, the  
event could be managed as an enterprise, either to make money or break even, in which case it  
has to operate like a business. This often means that a stand-alone event organisation or divi-  
sion of a public sector body is created to handle the event activity, with clear legal parameters  
of what it can do, and a remit for event development and management. Examples are event  
development corporations, bidding units, and some public-private partnerships.  
The not-for-profit sector  
Not-for-profit is a more accurate term than non-profit to describe them, because they can make  
surplus revenue \(and should aim to!\) but must use it to sustain and improve the organisa-  
tion and their events. Grant writing, fundraising, governance issues \(especially with volunteer  
boards\), service provision, needs assessments, volunteer recruitment and management, and  
programme evaluation are topics of particular interest in this sector, as well as not-for-profit  
marketing. Social entrepreneurship is a common motivator, the idea being that service clubs and  
charities should fill gaps in public sector services. This pertains mostly to the needs of disad-  
vantaged groups or fostering community development.  
The private, for-profit sector  
Growth in the events sector has led to the creation of numerous event production and man-  
agement companies, as well as companies that exist to produce or supply services to planned  
events. They are profit-making businesses. When events are viewed as business propositions  
it means that the owners/producers have to follow sound management principles and be  
focussed on the long-term viability, resilience, and sustainability of the event. In other words,  
professional event management is required.  
Organisational structure and coordination  
Many planned events are stand-alone organisations, while others are produced or managed  
within a larger organisation. This makes a huge difference with regard to governance and struc-  
ture. Similarly, one-time events are quite different from permanent organisations. This entire  
area of organisational structure and coordination \(both internal and external\) has largely been  
untouched by event researchers, although plenty of advice is available through professional  
associations and books written by experts. It links closely to other topics covered in this book,  
including decision-making and planning. 170  
Event Management Fundamentals  
A number of typical structures are illustrated and discussed in Getz \(2005\), including single  
and multi-organisational structures. Festivals are often produced by clubs, internally, and by  
stand-alone not-for-profit societies, but it is also common to find different organisations coop-  
erating to produce events. As well, sport events are frequently produced through formal links  
between governing bodies and local organising committees.  
Virtual organisations  
Many live events are produced by independent collaborators who come together only, or mainly,  
for the event. Most virtual events are produced by existing organisations, but the possibility  
exists for virtual organisations that have no permanent legal structure, governance, or location.  
They are made possible by digital technology and can range from a simple collaboration such  
as sharing information, to the full simulation of an office with its own data processing, meet-  
ings, and leadership. This type of virtual organisation makes sense when people are working  
from home, expertise is required from multiple, independent sources, or events are divided in  
time and space \(i.e., meta-events or asynchronous events\). Mostly this approach will be project  
based and follow project planning and management processes.  
*Resource Acquisition and Allocation*  
It goes without saying that events cannot be produced without a wide range of resources,  
including knowledge, people \(their skills and competencies\), money, equipment, support-  
ers, and venues. Resources, by definition, are tangible and intangible things with the poten-  
tial to be used. They can be used as investments to make something happen, or used and  
discarded – which violates the principles of sustainability. They can be squandered through  
poor decision-making, and their use is frequently controversial. Consider the spaces and ven-  
ues used by events, these are often contested by different interest groups, as are the monetary  
contributions of government in the building of venues and funding of events or event bidding.  
Once they are secured, how resources are allocated and controlled by their owners and man-  
agers to produce events becomes the most important question. This is more than an efficiency  
issue \(such as getting the most for one’s resources\), it is also ethical in nature. For example,  
how much should owners take from a company as personal income, how much should manag-  
ers get paid, and should the event reinvest in its community?  
The Resource Based Theory of the Firm suggests that organisations should possess rare and valuable  
resources that give them sustainable competitive advantages by protecting against resource  
imitation, transfer, mobility, or substitution \(Barney, 1991; Penrose, 1959\). In other words, an  
event should ideally possess its own committed set of resources that cannot be taken from it,  
and which make it unique.  
Resource Dependency Theory is also relevant. Event organisations should be thought of as open  
systems, as they are almost always dependent upon externally provided resources, including  
grants, sponsorship, and sales. Dependency on one source or a few, however, can be risky  
\(see the later discussion on organisational ecology\). Also, if the same resources are relied  
upon by more than one event \(e.g., one agency providing artistic support or one corporate  
sponsor working with multiple events or other types of organisations\), they might find  
that those resources are moved elsewhere or withdrawn – this is a vulnerability. Success, in  
this context, is defined as maximising the organisation’s power \(Pfeffer, 1981; Pfeffer and  
Salancik, 1978\), which can come from reducing dependency – or making others dependent  
on them. Event Management Fundamentals 171  
Firms lacking essential resources will seek relationships that provide them, possibly resulting  
in dependency. Event failures might therefore arise from a poor fit with the environment, as  
in the case where a festival is not able to attract interest and support from its host community  
because of cultural differences, a lack of key contacts, or internal management deficiencies.  
According to Donaldson \(1996\), ‘fit’ stems from how an organisation adapts to accommo-  
date environmental contingencies. Additional considerations relate to the scarcity of resources  
\(what are the alternative sources?\), the nature of the event’s operational environment \(com-  
petition or symbiotic relationships among resource users?\), certainty versus fluctuations in  
resource availability \(e.g., is long-term support guaranteed?\), and variability in resource needs  
\(are the same resources needed every year?\).  
The global pandemic made it clear to many organisations that they were over-dependent on  
one or a few resources. Many events experimented with alternative revenue-generating actions,  
such as holding virtual events, and others were forced to suspend all expenditures. Building  
resilience has therefore become essential. To deal with these resource issues a number of strat-  
egies are available. Events can attempt to secure resources from many sources, store resources  
for hard times \(a reserve fund\), or switch to new resource suppliers. They can try to reduce  
their need \(e.g., cost reductions\), influence the resource providers through lobbying, or decide  
to work with, or compete against, other organisations seeking resources.  
This theory has been used, together with stakeholder theory, by Getz et al. \(2007\) to help  
explain both failure and the institutionalisation of events. Other ecological and institutional  
theories of organisations also view the organisation or firm in terms of its internal dynamics,  
environmental interdependencies, and competing interests. Andersson and Getz \(2007\) exam-  
ined the financial position of a tourism-oriented street festival in Sweden within the context of  
resource dependency and stakeholder management theory. Using data from a five-year period,  
they revealed how costs associated with the strongest stakeholders \(i.e., those with the great-  
est bargaining power\) greatly increased relative to costs associated with weak stakeholders.  
The festival was also more able to increase its revenues from weak stakeholders than from  
those in strong bargaining positions.  
The knowledge-based theory of the firm suggests that organisations that possess, learn, and retain  
valuable knowledge and capabilities, embedding them in their culture, management systems,  
and stakeholder networks, can sustain competitive advantages and achieve superior perfor-  
mance \(Barney, 1991; Grant, 1996\). Information systems are necessary. Applied to events,  
managers should develop unique and inimitable knowledge or capabilities and make certain  
they are both retained and constantly developed. Consider, for example, the synergies to be  
gained through blending creative/artistic and business/management knowledge. Some events  
are blessed with a foundation of unique skills, expertise, or creative excellence. This knowledge  
\(both the how-to kind, and the accumulated-wisdom kind\) provides a competitive advantage  
and can help assure resilience. Fostering innovation and maintaining authentic traditions are  
also vital in this context. Becoming self-sufficient on the basis of knowledge is equivalent to  
holding core competencies and requires being a learning organisation. A similar concept is that  
of achieving competitive advantage through differentiation. Re-consider the TransRockies case  
in this context.  
A comparative advantage means that some events or event organisations have been endowed  
with better resources or appeal. This advantage could be in terms of support from their com-  
munities, which is a stakeholder issue, or in terms of their location. It could consist of tradition  
or authenticity. Competitive advantages accrue from wise management of whatever you possess,  
such as by providing target segments with services they are willing to pay for and doing it 172  
Event Management Fundamentals  
better than competitors. Adapting Porter’s \(1980\) classic model of competitive forces, many  
events are revealed to be in a relatively weak position. An event has to first assess its compet-  
itive environment as to threats. Competition is always likely to increase, and events are often  
substitutable by other events or other forms of entertainment. Both buyers \(companies and  
customers\) can go elsewhere unless there are few events or event-producing firms available. So  
how should events compete?  
Porter’s strategies for achieving and sustaining competitive advantage include a focus on costs  
\(keeping costs low, and passing savings on to the customers\), focusing on specific target mar-  
kets, or on differentiation \(being unique within the events sector\). Competing on price is  
possible for events, even if their costs are high, when subsidies and sponsorship support are  
available to compensate. Competing through differentiation makes a lot of sense, but unfortu-  
nately, numerous events exist for rather general purposes \(providing only generic benefits\) and  
many producers find it difficult to precisely target the market.  
In Event Studies, little attention has been given to competitiveness among events or event  
companies, particularly how this manifests itself geographically where different regions host  
events that compete and split market shares. Research on this important topic has to con-  
nect with stakeholder, institutional, and population ecology theory, as well as with marketing  
and positioning strategy. Little research has been conducted on events as businesses, or from  
a business and management perspective, so their comparative financial operations are little  
understood. Perhaps this is because so many events are in the public domain and not subject to  
normal business management principles, or because not-for-profit event organisations some-  
how believe they do not have to operate like a business. The basic facts, however, are that all  
events have to secure, manage and account for their resources, and that financial problems are  
one of the main causes of business and event failure.  
Event busineSS models  
Business model refers to how organisations are set up to generate value for the owners and  
stakeholders, including the basic ways of securing resources \(or making money\) and creating  
all its products and services. There will be a basic distinction between events created to pro-  
vide service \(e.g., social change, community development\) and those created to make a profit.  
The business model of an event will determine what resources are needed, and how resources  
are to be acquired to create the value being sought. If profit is the goal, budgeting and revenue  
generation will likely be quite different from events focussed on creating social or cultural  
value. Privately owned events have to be much more focussed on delivering goods and services  
that are in demand – that is, what customers will pay for. Applying service-dominant logic, all  
events are receiving and providing services in the process of value creation, leading managers  
to ask questions such as\: who benefits from our events? how are we benefitting those who  
provide our resources and consuming our events? How value is defined and measured becomes  
a central issue.  
Perić et al. \(2019\) developed a model for a business plan for events within the scope of sport  
tourism. Key resources were identified, including core competency as inputs to value capture  
\(through various revenue sources\) and key processes \(including design, marketing, and HR\),  
all related to the event’s value propositions. Of importance in this last category are commu-  
nication of experience, the product, service quality, customer orientation, and safety. Little  
research exists on events as business ventures, so our knowledge of microeconomics in the  
events sector is limited. The key question has to be\: how effective are events at generating Event Management Fundamentals 173  
revenues and profits? Wanhill \(2006\) is one of only a few researchers to have examined event  
finances in any detail. A related issue is the fact that so many events are produced in the public  
\(governmental\) sector and by not-for-profit societies. To some extent, they are isolated from  
market forces or the normal laws of supply and demand. Government subsidies can support  
events, for the public good, that could not survive on their own. Not-for-profit organisations  
can sometimes continue to produce events even when in chronic debt because stakeholders,  
including sponsors, trust them to deliver value.  
*Financial Management*  
This management function covers both revenue acquisition and its disbursement, with suitable  
controls and rational budgeting. It should be clear from previous sections that the sources of  
revenue pursued by events will reflect their ownership, mandate, and business model. The  
following are the most common, and their mix and importance vary greatly by ownership type.  
Sales Revenue\: Numerous events rely heavily on ticket sales, creating a serious resource depen-  
dency problem. The budget might predict revenue from sales \(this could include merchan-  
dise, food, and beverages\) and if targets are not reached, overspending and debt might be  
the result. To prevent losses, some concert promoters will cancel in advance of the date if  
sales do not match projections, with the result being disgruntled customers. Fees paid by  
participants is a typical source of revenue for participation sports, but it is almost always  
augmented by sponsorship. Securing major sponsors might be necessary before the event  
can be planned or confirmed, because – like ticket sales – generating adequate revenue from  
participants cannot always be assured. Free-to-enter events might very well have to excel  
at merchandise sales \(including food and beverages\) to generate adequate revenue. During  
the pandemic, many events got creative in generating revenue through virtual events, or  
the pre-sale \(through registration fees\) of events to be held in the future. Renting space to  
merchants and vendors, and providing access to customer databases can be another source,  
although privacy laws must be upheld.  
Grants and Fundraising\: During the pandemic, many venues and event organisations were  
sustained through special grants, although this was not a uniform practice across countries  
and regions. The culture sector in particular is often dependent upon direct government  
financial support, including ownership of venues and taking equity in events. Fundraising  
events are a staple in the not-for-profit sector, and event organisers should be good at this.  
Partnering with sports and corporations can be effective, making it part of the event’s spon-  
sorship campaigns.  
Sponsorship\: Sponsorship has received considerable attention from practitioners and  
researchers, undoubtedly as a reflection of its global importance in the events sector. It can  
best be defined in economic and marketing terms as an exchange relationship involving pay-  
ments made to events by external organisations \(these can and do include public agencies\)  
or persons, for specific benefits provided by the events. Cash is almost always preferred, but  
contra in the form of goods and services provided free or at a discount can be beneficial.  
Advice on event sponsorship can be found in Skinner and Rukavina \(2003\) and Getz \(2005\).  
The International Events Group \(IEG\) specialises in seminars and publications on event spon-  
sorship, including a legal guide to sponsorship. Most event associations have publications and  
hold seminars on sponsorship. Catherwood and van Kirk \(1992\) commented on the growth  
of corporate sponsorship after the commercial success of the Los Angeles Olympic Games.  
Crompton \(1995\) reviewed reasons for sponsorship growth and examined criteria used by 174  
Event Management Fundamentals  
corporations when deciding on what events to sponsor. Weppler and McCarville \(1995\) con-  
ducted research on how corporate decisions on event sponsorship were actually made. Wicks  
\(1995\) and Mount and Niro \(1995\) examined event sponsorship in small communities. In this  
environment, decisions are often made on the basis of community goodwill and civic duty.  
There are numerous issues and risks associated with corporate sponsorship. Events have  
to worry about goal displacement, with the interests of commercial sponsors possibly taking  
over. Dependency on one or a few sponsors is potentially a problem. Sponsors face risks from  
ambush marketers and a loss of goodwill if the event goes wrong for them. Indeed, it is a form of  
co-branding that impacts both parties.  
Research on the effectiveness of event sponsorship has been conducted by Kerstetter and  
Gitelson \(1995\) and Coughlan and Mules \(2002\), examining sponsorship recall among  
event patrons, revealing that it is not easy to obtain memorable results. The mainstream  
marketing literature has many more studies on effectiveness, benefits, and risks – mostly  
from the sponsors’ points of view. Increasing attention is being given to how sponsors eval-  
uate the effectiveness of their investments in events. Sponsorship research has numerous  
perspectives, including stakeholder management, strategic planning, organisational culture  
and its evolution, risk management, financial controls, marketing and communications,  
legal issues, and branding. For example, Drengner et al. \(2011\) researched event-brand con-  
gruence, and Andersson et al. \(2013\) assessed strategies for events to acquire sponsorship  
revenue. There remains a need for research aimed at improving our understanding of the  
multidimensional effects of sponsorship in the events world. Maestas \(2009\) considered  
return on investment \(ROI\), return on objectives, media exposure analysis, and market  
value analysis as methods in use. Koronios et al. \(2022\) in their research on sport-event  
sponsorship emphasised the prediction of actual purchase behaviour, being an outcome  
most sponsors will value.  
Ballouli et al. \(2018\) examined the effectiveness of activation through ancillary events to  
leverage mega-events for sponsors. The term activation is used when referring to how spon-  
sors leverage their relationship with events, generally within more integrated campaigns that  
corporations would call experiential marketing. If events provide satisfying, transforming, and  
memorable experiences the goodwill should be transferred to the sponsors – if the sponsors  
are effective in their activation. What does this include? Employing social media to connect  
directly with event customers is essential, hopefully resulting in happy event guests becoming  
brand ambassadors for both the event and the sponsors. This can be combined with the use of  
online influencers.  
Budgeting\: Raj and Rashid in their book Events Management \(2022\) explained the principles,  
including accounting, auditing, financial statements, and the regulatory environment. It is  
impossible to run a business or sustain an event without compliance, and therefore employ-  
ing a professional accountant or a consulting firm to do accounts and audits is necessary.  
Every manager will be involved in budgeting, but there are several other financial management  
reports to understand. The balance sheet specifies the organisation’s assets \(fixed assets are prop-  
erty, machinery, and equipment; current assets are mostly in the form of cash\) and liabilities  
\(i.e., debt\), and indicates the current health of the organisation. Usually, this will be produced  
at the end of every financial year. It will also indicate capital employed in private businesses,  
being invested by owners and shareholders. Managers should also be able to interpret a num-  
ber of ratios pertaining to the current position and overall financial health of the organisation.  
While businesses tend to focus on ROI as the bottom line, many events will be more interested  
in ratios such as return on experience \(ROE\). Event Management Fundamentals 175  
Think of the budget as the event’s financial plan. As with all plans, it plots a future course of  
action to attain goals, and it should therefore be flexible enough to accommodate desired and  
necessary changes - which is also why most budgets contain contingency or reserve funds. The  
event budget becomes fixed at a certain point \(keeping a reserve or contingency fund available\)  
with line items specified. For events, the typical revenue items were discussed above, and  
expenditure items are commonly as follows\:  
l Rentals \(venues; equipment\).  
l Capital expenditure \(equipment or land/venue purchases; the largest item for mega-events  
requiring new infrastructure\).  
l Entertainment \(artists; providing VIP services\).  
l Staffing \(wages; costs associated with volunteers\).  
l Supplies \(including merchandise, food, and beverages\).  
l Insurance.  
l Debt repayment.  
l Cash withdrawals by owners/investors.  
Events free-to-enter are common, meaning there is no possibility of ticket revenue. Does this  
mean they are more or less likely to suffer financial losses? That is unknown, but free-to-use  
events do create a huge consumer surplus and must either be subsidised by some agency or have  
alternative revenue sources. Lines of credit with lending institutions will help solve cash flow  
problems because expenditures almost always precede revenues. Cash flow problems are one  
of the leading causes of failure for small businesses and can become severe for events. All kinds  
of tactics can be employed to obtain cash up front, such as registration fees for participants,  
online merchandise sales, subscriptions to some kind of benefit system \(e.g., priority ticket  
purchases, and discounts\), or straight-forward donorship.  
There are several possible starting points in budgeting, the most prudent being to get assur-  
ances of how much money and other resources will be available to produce the event. This can  
be the same as zero-based budgeting, meaning you get ALL your revenue streams established  
before even talking about how to spend. Events within the corporate and public sectors often  
have a funding commitment well in advance, as they exist within departments that sanction  
events. Event managers therefore know what they can spend, and presumably, there is over-  
sight to ensure the budgeted costs do not exceed the given resources. It sounds neat and simple  
until one realises that costs tend to increase or be unpredictable in other ways, and there is still  
a need to ensure that any resulting liabilities will be covered by somebody. This is the under-  
writing problem all events will face – who is responsible for the debt? For mega-events, often it  
is the national government that must assume all liabilities. Passing liabilities on to others is, of  
course, a staple strategy within risk management.  
The opposite launching point is to start with a list of desired expenditures, being the pro-  
gramme, entertainment, capital investments, and so on, then determine if the event can gener-  
ate enough resources to cover the anticipated costs. This will work if the revenue streams are  
found, otherwise, it can be fatal because it leads to money being committed well in advance of  
revenue generation. The costs become unavoidable, while the revenue streams are targets for  
sales and sponsorship, or grants and loans. The classic example is to pay for entertainers well  
in advance and to hope that ticket sales will be sufficient to at least break even. Needless to  
say, many event bankruptcies have resulted from this approach. The basic principle to follow  
is this\: do not make expenditures unless there is assured matching revenue. This principle will 176  
Event Management Fundamentals  
no doubt be violated many times in the event world but with serious risks. Event managers can  
hope that any liabilities will be covered by someone else, that revenue projections will all be  
met, or that costs can be reduced. Hope is not a plan.  
Pricing\: Any of the standard service-pricing strategies can be employed. If budgets are set accord-  
ing to a break-even strategy \(e.g., “We do not need or want to make a profit, we aim to make our  
event experience as affordable as possible”\) it is laudable socially, but financially very risky for  
reasons discussed above. More prudent is cost-plus pricing where projected revenue from sales  
\(tickets and merchandise\) exceeds projected costs by a certain amount or percentage. It is less  
risky but requires really sound forecasts and spending discipline. Making a profit is necessary  
for private businesses, which is often to generate the desired ROI for investors and owners.  
The special case of free-admission events has to be examined. Benefits accrue to attendees \(the  
consumer surplus\), but they often have to pay for travel and give up time that could be used to  
earn income. This is why economists estimate the value of their travel and time, and can use  
that estimate to determine the worth of the event. However, it should always be remembered  
that some agency, corporation, or institution is paying for free-to-enter events, OR revenue  
must be generated in other ways, such as merchandise sales.  
Revenue \(or yield\) management\: McMahon-Beattie and Yeoman \(2004\) discussed revenue manage-  
ment for events. Similar to yield management, as practiced by hotels and airlines, this financial  
management approach is suitable for events with a fixed and perishable capacity \(i.e., only so  
many tickets to sell, but if unsold the capacity is wasted\) and predictable demand fluctuations  
\(by day, week, or hour\). Using historical data on demand fluctuations to make forecasts, rev-  
enue managers adjust prices or make special offers to entice customers in what would other-  
wise be low-demand periods. This can affect programming and staffing as well. Season tickets,  
multi-entry passes, discounts for seniors or other groups, and various other pricing and pro-  
motion tactics have to be integrated with revenue management.  
Controls and accountability\: This is definitely a neglected area of research. Raj \(2004\) examined  
the human, or behavioural, aspects of financial management for events. This approach cov-  
ers not only professionalism but also internal relationships and morale. It was stressed that  
budgeting is not just financial planning, it is also designed to influence human behaviour and  
goal-setting.  
*Authority, Responsibility, and Administration*  
Who can make decisions, chains of command \(or delegation of responsibilities\) – including  
the functions of managers and teams, units and sub-units – all stem from the basic governance  
structures. Private companies might have a simple structure with one or several owners holding  
all authority, and thereby accepting all responsibility for outcomes, but they can also have elab-  
orate structures including boards of directors, departments with managers, and well-defined  
duties and responsibilities for every staff position. Events in the public sector might find they  
have to report to higher-level agencies or senior civil servants. Volunteer-run events can apply  
principles of bottom-up or democratic decision-making, including semi-independent work  
teams, but over time might find they are professionalising and getting more bureaucratic in  
nature.  
Administration\: This term is often used synonymously with management, but for our purposes,  
it will be defined as the essential support services needed within every organisation. Note that  
EMBOK takes a broader view of administration, including a number of other management Event Management Fundamentals 177  
functions like human relations and financing. Generically, administration covers the following\:  
secretarial services; book-keeping and accounting; information storage and processing; inter-  
nal scheduling \(meetings and appointments\) and communications; reception and customer  
service; filing; documentation \(manuals, policies, rules, and procedures\); procurement and  
management of supplies; computing and technical support; research; invoicing, billing; main-  
taining social media accounts; organising virtual meetings; office furniture; and maybe even  
water and coffee.  
# Inter-Organisation and Stakeholder Relations  
No event exists without support, and no organisation can avoid the influence of many stake-  
holders, both internal and external. Hence the critical importance of stakeholder theory and  
management. We start by presenting an open systems model of the event and its organisation  
which illustrates vital internal and external processes and relationships.  
Open Systems Model\: Figure 8.2 \(derived from Getz and Frisby, 1988\) follows from open systems  
theory wherein the basic premise is that organisations are always interdependent. Resources  
are inputs to the event. Its outcomes can be resources for others and will have a ripple effect  
through the external environment. The general environment takes us back to global forces and  
trends which have to be considered through environmental and future scanning. Of more  
immediate concern is the community context, which includes most event stakeholders and the  
origin of most inputs \(i.e., information, support, and resources\). The internal environment is the  
organisation that produces the event, and all its management systems.  
In this conceptualisation, the event is a transforming process intended to achieve desired out-  
comes. There can also be unintended outcomes, and externalities – like pollution – that are not  
normally accounted for by the event organisers. Multiple stakeholders will evaluate the event  
and its organisation, and this process is labelled external evaluation. The internal evaluation

Event Management Fundamentals  
process is the task of managers or owners who have to determine if they are meeting their  
goals \(i.e., their effectiveness\) and how efficiently they are obtaining and utilising resources.  
Evaluation and feedback should influence future decision-making through strategic planning.  
Open-system diagnostics involves using this model to identify problems and to improve both  
efficiency and effectiveness. Effectiveness means the degree to which goals are obtained or the  
organisation fulfils its mandate. Use of the model helps in identifying how the mandate and  
goals are externally driven by various stakeholders and environmental forces, and how trans-  
forming processes are directed towards achieving those goals. Evaluation systems have to be  
directed towards identifying goal attainment, although the goal-free evaluation approach some-  
times has benefits \(see Chapter 14\). Efficiency refers to how well resources are used to generate  
the desired outcomes. The model, when detailed for a given organisation, can suggest ways to  
improve the flow and use of resources, cut costs \(such as heavy administration costs\), and eval-  
uate outcomes achieved in terms of resources required \(i.e., measures of costs and benefits\).  
An event’s intended outputs, being the things it generates through the transforming process,  
might include attendance, revenue, or customer satisfaction. Outputs are therefore short-term  
and measurable, whereas we use outcomes synonymously with impacts, stressing that impacts  
are often perceived or felt in a subjective way.  
Stakeholder and network theory\: Stakeholder theory \(Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Freeman,  
1984; Jawahar and McLaughlin, 2001; Mitchell et al., 1997\) has been thoroughly examined  
for application to events and tourism by van Niekerk and Getz \(2019\) in the book Event Stake-  
holders. The theory helps explain the origins, operation, and evolution of events, and provides  
direction to owners and managers on how to manage their internal and external stakeholder  
relationships \(Izzo et al., 2012; Cavicchi and Santini, 2014\).  
Stakeholders are those persons or groups who can influence the organisation, or are influenced  
by it. Core stakeholder attributes, according to Mitchell et al. \(1997, 865–867\), are\:  
l ‘Power’\:  
“The ability of a party that it has or can gain access to impose its will in the relationship”  
.  
l ‘Legitimacy’\:  
“A generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper,  
or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions”  
.  
l ‘Urgency’\:  
“The degree to which stakeholder claims call for immediate attention”  
.  
l ‘Stakeholder salience’\: a function of possessing the other three stakeholder attributes  
There is also a moral \(or normative\) aspect to stakeholder theory, which argues that managers  
should work with all those affected by the organisation, as in the case of events working with  
their community and special interest groups \(Ziakas and Costa, 2010b\), regardless of their  
power to influence the organisation.  
Using the analogy of a political market square, Larson and Wikstrom \(2001\) and Larson \(2002\)  
examined several Swedish events. Stakeholders played ‘power games’ and negotiated from vary-  
ing positions of power. They formed alliances to realise their goals for the event and the  
organisation producing it. Critical roles identified among the stakeholders included those  
of ‘gatekeeping’ \(deciding who gets in\), negotiation, coalition-building, trust- or legitimacy-  
building, and identity-building for the event in general. Larson \(2009\) later analysed event  
networks and concluded that they resulted in three different categories of Political Market  
Squares, which she labelled the ‘jungle’, the ‘park’, and the ‘garden’; these represented tumul-  
tuous \(i.e., jungle\), dynamic, and institutionalised event networks. The institutionalised  
network \(i.e., the park\) was prescribed for stable event organisations and closely related to Event Management Fundamentals 179  
event portfolio planning. Larson called for more research on understanding tumultuous and  
dynamic event networks.  
Network theory is closely related to stakeholder theory. Social networks are often important  
for entrepreneurs, especially when obtaining the resources and support required to start an  
event. Social capital in this sense means the network of people and organisations you can rely  
on to help you. Organisational networks obviously involve all the stakeholders, but there is  
an emphasis in network theory on centrality as an attribute, their degree of connectedness, and  
bridging organisations. Ziakas and Costa \(2010b\) employed network analysis to examine the  
inter-organisational patterns that shape a host community’s capacity to capitalise on its event  
portfolio. This method allows for the identification of linkages, both strong and weak, cen-  
tral organisations, and the nature of interactions. These researchers believe that analysis of  
inter-institutional networks can suggest a community’s capacity for building and managing an  
event portfolio, and can be used as a strategic tool.  
Stakeholder management\: Getz et al. \(2007\) described and classified external festival stakehold-  
ers based on case studies from Sweden and Calgary, Canada. Figure 8.3 shows the resulting  
conceptualisation. The various categories are not mutually exclusive, and indeed the research  
Figure 8.3 Major Stakeholder Types and Roles in Festival Networks  
*Source\:* Adapted from Getz et al. \(2007\). Reprinted with permission of Cognizant Communication  
Corporation 180  
Event Management Fundamentals  
showed clearly that some stakeholders have multiple roles. For example, the city government  
is often simultaneously a facilitator \(giving grants and other resources\), co-producer \(sharing  
staff and venues\), owner/controller \(placing officials on the event’s board of directors\), and  
regulator, which can make its event-related policies confusing or contradictory.  
Suppliers and venues are often brought into the festival organisation as sponsors, and this is  
generally recognised as being a good strategy for reducing dependency and costs. Allies and  
collaborators might include marketing partnerships with tourism or the collaborative work of  
professional and affinity groups. How these stakeholders wield power and negotiate the goals  
and strategies of the event can be referred to as a political market square.  
Van Niekerk and Getz \(2019\) explained stakeholder theory in detail and gave examples of its  
applications to event management and event tourism. In their model called “A blended strategy  
matrix for stakeholder management”, they drew upon the seminal work of Savage et al. \(1991\) and  
others to emphasise the desirability of fostering relationships with potential collaborators, as  
well as identifying and developing appropriate strategies for those external agencies with the  
power to threaten events.  
Wallace and Michopoulou \(2019\) found that practitioners did not understand or use stake-  
holder theory and available models, and on the basis of focus groups recommended returning  
to the basic formulation of Freeman\: that is, stakeholders defined as those who either affect  
or are affected by the organisation. In their ‘stakeholder sandwich’, the researchers proposed  
self-mapping by persons on the basis of a specific place and event. Legitimacy was considered  
to be inherent in the definition of stakeholder, and qualitative descriptors such as primary and  
secondary were deemed to be vague. Stakeholders with multiple roles, especially local govern-  
ment, would be able to elucidate their roles with greater nuance. A further refinement was to  
distinguish between stakeholders generating or experiencing quantitative outputs, and those  
generating or experiencing qualitative outcomes.  
It must be cautioned that practitioners seldom refer to theories or models that academics  
develop, which in no way detracts from the importance or utility of models. What practi-  
tioners usually want are shortcut solutions to problems and immediate results. Much of the  
stakeholder-related theory and models for events advanced by Getz originated in a very simple  
form of research\: sitting down with practitioners and asking them to name the people and  
organisations they work with, then elaborating on relationships and how they are managed.  
This can lead to a mapping exercise, developing a simple sketch, and with prompts can be  
extended to encompass all those affected or impacted by an event.  
Collaboration theory relates to how various stakeholders get together in partnerships, alliances,  
or other joint efforts \(see Jamal and Getz, 1995; Wood and Gray, 1991\). In true collaborations,  
each partner gives up some degree of control to work with others in achieving common goals.  
For example, when events form associations, which can be called alliances, they generally do  
not give up any independence. Events can partner with other events or with tourist organisa-  
tions for joint marketing, again without giving up any real power. But if events agree to work  
closely with each other, perhaps sharing offices, staff, and resources, this collaboration entails  
a loss of some degree of independence and poses some risks that must be balanced against the  
gains. Collaboration is a feature of portfolio management, although it might occur because of  
top-down control or influence such as funding.  
Most often, collaborations work in policy domains such as tourism and culture, or for major  
projects. Long \(2000\), for example, studied the co-operation between tourism and the arts Event Management Fundamentals 181  
developed for the UK Year of Visual Arts. These were contractual and short-lived, as opposed  
to more permanent federations. Long concluded that lessons from this and other examples of  
collaboration and partnership can be applied to relationships with sponsors, reconciling goals,  
achieving economic efficiencies, or dealing with political interests.  
Stokes \(2004\) examined inter-organisational relations of public sector events organisations in  
Australia, where all states have event development companies or departments. She identified  
the relationships and knowledge used in event strategies and identified the importance of  
shared knowledge as an incentive for participating in networks. Stakeholders included com-  
munity representatives, public sector managers such as events and tourism agencies, corporate  
leaders, events managers, and tourism industry suppliers. Key elements in these sociospatial  
knowledge networks are activity spaces, place inventories, and information nodes. A corporate  
orientation among stakeholders mostly applied at the state level, where the emphasis was on  
tourism development – such as bidding for major events. There was more of a community  
orientation at the regional level. For staging major events, formal alliances, and collaborations  
were created – but not for strategy in general.

The Lusofonia Festival celebrates the diaspora of Portuguese-speaking communities in  
Macao, China. It has been celebrated for over 20 years and it was organised by the gov-  
ernment to commemorate and recognise the contribution of the Portuguese-speaking  
communities to Macao’s economic and social developments. Following the transfer of  
sovereignty from Portugal to China in 1999, many from the Portuguese-speaking com-  
munities chose to continue to live in Macao and continued playing an important role  
in Macao’s society. These communities are Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau,  
collectively Goa, Daman and Diu, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, East Timor,  
Portugal, and Macao.  
Over the course of three days, the festival attracts approximately 30,000 visitors made  
up of local citizens and tourists. Essentially a cultural festival, the Lusofonia Festival is  
reminiscent of Portuguese ‘festa’ events, which are outdoor fairs incorporating food,  
music, dance, and games. Indeed, the major highlight of the Lusofonia Festival is the  
remarkable booths each representing a Portuguese-speaking community in Macao.  
These booths introduce to visitors their unique photographs, arts and crafts, cos-  
tumes, literature, food, and wine, most of which are influenced by the Portuguese cul-  
ture reflecting subtle and significant aspects of the Lusophone empire. \(See Plates 8.1  
and 8.2.\) 182

The Portuguese-speaking community is an important component of the success of  
the Lusofonia Festival. It plays various roles as stakeholders but most significantly, the  
role of both hosts and participants. This case study explores the benefits of engaging  
the diaspora community that represents different stakeholder groups and sheds light  
on their role in ensuring the success of the Lusofonia Festival. The observations made  
in this case study were collected in a wider study by the author exploring the role of  
diaspora festivals in Macao.  
Stakeholders as an Integral Component in the Festival  
The diaspora community as a stakeholder group must not be alienated but is an  
integral component of the festival organisation. The objective of the festival is to  
commemorate and recognise the contribution of the Portuguese-speaking commu-  
nities in Macao. It is important that these groups are visibly involved throughout the  
festival assuming different roles. In addition, the direction bestowed upon Macao  
by Beijing is to adopt a ‘One Centre, One Platform’ economic strategy within the  
guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and China’s Belt and Road Initiative.  
‘One Centre’ refers to the creation of Macao as a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure  
whereas ‘One Platform’ refers to the economic and cultural platform between China  
and Portuguese-speaking countries. Not only does the festival fulfil the objective of  
recognising the Portuguese-speaking communities politically, but it also reiterates their  
continued contribution to Macao and even at a national level.  
Unlike other cultural celebrations and festivals in Macao, the Lusofonia Festival  
extends beyond a Portuguese theme, but the cultural elements from Portuguese and  
Portuguese-speaking are diversified, rich, and profound. These are manifested in arts  
and cultural objects but the involvement of the people from these cultures enrich  
the authentic experience of festival participants and a realistic Portuguese presence  
within the society. Although there are a number of Portuguese architectures scattered  
throughout Macao – a number of these were enlisted as a unesCO World Heritage  
Site in 2005 – the Portuguese elements in the city are increasingly diminishing. This is  
in part due to the population characteristics of Macao\: first, there was a huge increase  
of immigrants in the last 20 years following Macao’s unprecedented economic boom  
due to the liberalisation of the gaming legislations; second, the majority of the popu-  
lation is ethnically Chinese, diluting the once rich Portuguese and mixed communities  
in Macao. To put this in a clearer perspective, the population of Macao in 2016 was  
650,000, of whom just 40% of the population was born in Macao, and about 1.8% of  
the total population was ethnically Portuguese or mixed. The Lusofonia Festival con-  
textualise the Portuguese heritage in Macao by offering visitors – local citizens and  
tourists alike – a close encounter with the Portuguese-speaking communities to expe-  
rience and learn about their cultures.  
Stakeholders Must Find Aesthetic Value in the Festival  
Unlike in a commercial environment where profitability is a primary concern and stake-  
holder needs are more apparent, the expectations of the diaspora communities in the  
Lusofonia Festival are subtle and often less obvious. In order to engage the diaspora  
communities as they are integral to the success of the festival, it is crucial to ensure 184  
Event Management Fundamentals  
their needs and expectations are fulfilled. To the majority of the Portuguese-speaking  
communities, there are two aesthetic qualities of the Lusofonia Festival essential to the  
festival spirit.  
The diaspora communities need to feel they belong to the Lusofonia Festival not only  
as facilitators – as actors in a diaspora festival – but be part of it. They look for a  
good time to enjoy with family and friends, to rekindle with old friends, and to meet  
new acquaintances over food and drinks. For example, many would meet people at  
the Brazil booth over a glass of *caipirinha*, a very popular Brazilian cocktail. As the  
Portuguese-speaking countries all share some common cultural traits, for example, in  
food, many would meet and discuss recipes and special ingredients added to *feijoada*,  
a traditional Portuguese dish of meat stew with beans, to reflect their country’s unique  
flavour. The diaspora community needs to own the festival in order to be truly part of  
it. This is evident in their commitment to the festival. For instance, some would spend  
more than subsidised in order to provide a richer experience to visitors. It was also  
observed that the majority of the booths representing the countries were decorated  
by hand, in some cases, the setup took days to complete. To ensure the designs reflect  
an authentic aspect of the culture, members of the diaspora communities personally  
decorated the booths, often in the evenings after their own full-time work.  
The other aesthetic value that the diaspora communities find at the Lusofonia Festi-  
val is an opportunity to liminal experience. The work environment – and life – is very  
different from either of the home cultures. The Lusofonia Festival is reminiscent of  
Portuguese outdoor festivals, a nostalgic sentiment many in the communities long for.  
Additionally, the festive atmosphere and physical settings of the festival also remove  
the barrier that otherwise exists between members of the Portuguese-speaking com-  
munities and the general population. Cultural differences, such as language, as well as  
background like education and employment, almost naturally separate these groups.  
For instance, the local-born, younger generations of the diaspora communities opt for  
education in the Portuguese School whereas the majority of the population attends  
Chinese- or English-medium schools. In fact, postcolonial issues often create barriers  
between members of the Portuguese-speaking communities; the Lusofonia Festival  
offers a platform for mutual understanding and respect, as well as an opportunity to  
learn more about each other. This would have been otherwise impossible in usual work,  
school, or social settings.  
Stakeholders Engage Only in Supportive Environments  
Stakeholders’ engagement is more profound in a supportive environment. The Luso-  
fonia Festival is an inclusive event; it welcomes and caters to all types of festivalgoers.  
Although Portuguese is the predominant language used in the festival, Chinese and  
English announcements and notices supplement the main commentaries in Portuguese.  
The majority of the diaspora communities speak Portuguese, Chinese, and English  
which ensures most of the festival visitors are addressed. The festival programme also  
subtly influences the mix of visitors; for instance, children’s activities like pony riding,  
face painting, body tattoos, and kid games are scheduled in the early afternoon, and  
live bands in the evenings to attract families and adult crowds, respectively. In addition,  
many activities available at the festival encourage participation, for example, sandbag Event Management Fundamentals 185  
races, foosball tournaments, and dances welcome all to join. Parades at the Lusofonia  
Festival makeup of local and international dance troupes from the Portuguese-speaking  
communities also instil a festive and inclusive atmosphere – such as by physically ‘drag-  
ging’ onlookers into the parade.  
The physical environment in which the Lusofonia Festival also plays a huge role in  
engaging stakeholders. The event is held in one of the Portuguese neighbourhoods  
in Macao, with traditional Portuguese houses and buildings, a church and quaint,  
quiet gardens, along cobblestone roads and pavements. The decorations at the fes-  
tival as well as booths and crowds instil a festive and joyous mood. Members of the  
Portuguese-speaking communities are attached to the surroundings and feel like hosts  
welcoming others to their ‘home’. It is usual for festivalgoers from the diaspora com-  
munities to introduce and actively engage with visitors at the Lusofonia Festival, assum-  
ing the role of the host even though they are not staff.  
Diaspora communities as a stakeholder group such as in the case of the Lusofonia Fes-  
tival in Macao are more involved under certain circumstances, namely, stakeholders  
are integral to the festival, stakeholders find value in the festival and stakeholders are  
engaged in a supportive environment. Although these observations may not apply to  
other festive events and celebrations, it is prudent that policymakers encourage the  
continuity of diaspora festivals by providing adequate support, particularly when the  
organisers and those involved are commonly disadvantaged due to their minority sta-  
tus and access to resources. Diaspora communities, and by extension, ethnic minority  
groups within a society are essential to the economic and social development of a place;  
these events are not merely another item to enrich the destination’s tourism portfolio.  
# Oganisational Ecology and Event Populations  
This interrelated group of theory fragments \(Hannan et al. 2007\), looks at whole populations  
of organisations within their environment. While most management theory teaches that sound  
practice and adaptive strategies can ensure success, ecological models suggest that organisa-  
tions are also likely to succeed or fail in response to environmental factors. The dynamics of  
populations of festivals and events must be considered, as well as the efforts of individual event  
organisations. Seminal works in organisational ecology include\: Hannan and Freeman \(1977,  
1984\); Carroll \(1984\); Hannan and Carroll \(1992\); and Baum \(1992\). The ecological theory  
seeks to explain the rates of birth, growth, and mortality of a population of organisations in any  
given environment. Several principles are emphasised. First, diversity is a property of aggre-  
gates of organisations, not of specific organisations. Second, organisations often have difficulty  
changing fast enough to adapt to uncertain environmental conditions. Third, organisations  
arise and disappear regularly, like the birth and death of animals.  
In nature, a population is defined by its genetic species, as in the human population, but not so in  
organisational ecology. Baum and Oliver \(1996\) describe the concept of a population as follows\:  
A set of organizations engaged in similar activities and with similar patterns of resource  
utilization constitutes a population. Populations form as a result of processes that isolate or  
segregate one set of organizations from another, including technological incompatibilities and  
institutional actions such as government regulations. 186  
Event Management Fundamentals  
In other words, we should not assume that all festivals, or all periodic sport events, are alike  
and constitute a discrete population. They might have quite different activities \(or services  
offered\) and resource dependencies. The vast diversity of festival forms and styles \(e.g., per-  
forming and visual arts, humour, spectacle, rituals, and commemorations\), variations arising  
from ownership \(i.e., profit, non-profit, and public\), and differences attributable to size and  
location all make it very difficult to view them as a single species.  
There are two perspectives on events that make them resemble a single population, for both  
public policy and tourism industry strategy. This is because the variations among festivals are  
not as important when considering what festivals can do for policy and strategy, from social  
marketing to place marketing. As instruments of policy, events are fit into portfolios \(Getz,  
2005; Ziakas, 2013\) that must meet specified goals and account for their resources, especially if  
public money has been provided to them. Within a whole population of events in a given area,  
it might not matter if single events fail, or change in some dramatic way, but within a managed  
portfolio it might cause a serious problem.  
Within ecological theory, individual organisms \(i.e., events\) share space and resources with other  
organisational populations, and the dynamics of this community affect all its members. For exam-  
ple, festivals might have to share venues and grants with other cultural institutions and tourist  
attractions. Communities are those species sharing the same ecosystem, which can be defined as a  
city or nation. The ecosystem analogy could take on a number of interesting dimensions when  
applied to festivals or events. Many interactions with their environment can be analysed, not the  
least of which must be stakeholder relationships, marketing, ownership, and decision-making.  
A basic step is to measure and keep track of vital statistics, that is, the demographics of the pop-  
ulation. These data are seldom available, mainly because no agency keeps track of new events  
\(call them births\), deaths, failures, growth rates, and the overall health of the population.  
Unless there are policies and goals, the overall population and its health do not even become  
issues in most areas \(Table 8.3\).

Many small, volunteer-driven events are challenged  
when it comes to both competing against others  
and collaborating at the level of portfolios and  
populations.  
Event networks should be explicitly fostered.

Well-established events must guard against  
complacency when it comes to their uniqueness  
and appeal, and against an overly conservative  
organisational culture.  
Events should strive for financial self-sufficiency  
Research is needed on the nature of niches  
that enduring events hold within competitive  
environments.  
*Specialist* events rely on a narrow range or limited  
number of sources and must be efficient in  
exploiting them.  
*Generalist* events avoid over-dependency by  
exploiting a wide range of resources and are less  
vulnerable to rapidly changing environmental  
conditions  
Large, hallmark events can make it difficult for  
small and new events to find and keep adequate  
resources, making networking and collaboration  
essential.  
Large cities and wealthy economies offer more  
scope for specialisation  
Legitimation refers to the acceptance of events as  
a normal and proper form of organisation; around  
the world, events are considered to be legitimate  
instruments of corporate and governmental  
strategy, however, as the number of events  
increases, the number of new starts is likely to  
decrease and the number of failures increases,  
owing to resource competition.  
Event populations are also likely to meet growth  
limits for other reasons, including competition  
from other leisure sectors; a corollary is that the  
injection of more resources \(say by governments or  
sponsors\) might result in a growth spurt  
This theory thread argues for formal event  
networks and portfolio management in which  
linkages, sharing, and collaboration are maximised  
Density dependence is illustrated in Figure 8.4 as a possible explanation of why event popula-  
tions might rise and fall in number, reflecting start-ups and terminations. The idea that there  
are limits on numbers might be extended to types and sizes, given the other organisational  
ecology variables \(especially the idea of finding a niche\). 188

*What Is a Resilient and Healthy Population of Events?*  
The coming and going of festivals and events are often ignored, especially in countries where  
a free market is assumed. Many players are at work in this sector – from diverse government  
agencies and not-for-profits to corporate sponsors and for-profit event companies. However,  
as a result of the global pandemic, it has to be asked if the event populations in countries and  
cities were resilient \(i.e., how many failed or survived?\) and what exactly is a healthy, resilient  
population of events? The same questions must be asked of managed portfolios. A population  
has to be able to sustain itself, given available resources. This might result in growth or decline  
as necessary, or as judged to be appropriate. In times of resource scarcity, or shocks such as the  
pandemic, adjustments to population size will have to be made consciously or through natural  
selection \(i.e., the weak will be allowed to perish\). A directed or coordinated open system of  
organisations has to be able to adjust to its environment – or if possible, influence external  
forces in such a way as to sustain equilibrium, that is, the level of resource consumption that  
will keep it healthy. This might require planned adjustments to population size or a reduction  
in resource consumption by all members.  
Festivals and other event-producing organisations are typically not able to achieve popula-  
tion equilibrium because they are not coordinated, nor is their sector directed by any agency.  
Owing to the special nature of festivals as manifestations of fundamental social, cultural, and  
economic needs, and as instruments of policy and strategy, the health of festival populations  
requires additional and essentially goal-dependent considerations. Other periodic events,  
mainly sports in terms of numbers, can be given similar treatment insofar as they implement  
event tourism policy and strategy or sport development and human health.  
There have been only a few studies of event populations. Jaeger and Mykletun \(2009\) devel-  
oped a festivalscape map in Finnmark, Norway. Andersson, Getz, and Mykletun \(2013\) stud-  
ied three Norwegian counties, finding the growth of festivals correlated with growth in the  
national gross domestic product; the density dependency theory was confirmed.  
The International Festivals and Events Association \(IFEA\) \(http\://www.ifea.com/p/  
industryawards/worldfestivalandeventcityaward\) annually awards ‘festival city’ status and its Event Management Fundamentals 189  
evaluative criteria suggest what it takes to sustain a healthy and resilient population of events.  
Their main criteria are\:  
l Community overview\: population; venues available and their capacity; infrastructure and  
parking availability; tourist numbers attributed to events.  
l Community festivals and events\: numbers, types, and dates; budgets; sponsorship support;  
volunteer numbers and hours worked; attendance; target markets and numbers achieved;  
awards received; and professionals with certification.  
l City/governmental support of festivals and events\: policies and support programmes; direct  
funding given; city roles and process in approval of events; and coordination.  
l Participation by city/politicians in events; regulations affecting events; and training provided.  
l Non-governmental community support of festivals and events\: volunteer involvement in  
the event sector; total sponsorship provided; media support; support from DMO, Chamber  
of Commerce, and other organisations; incentives to events from venues; access to local  
suppliers; and direct industry involvement in the events sector.  
l Leveraging ‘community capital’ created by festivals and events, such as branding; tourism  
marketing; corporate recruiting; media coverage and public relations; enhancing exposure to  
the arts; encouraging social integration or celebration; better use of facilities or parks; and  
long-term legacies of events.  
l Extra credit for actions such as\: skills development; availability of certificate or degree pro-  
grammes in event management; sharing among festivals; and efforts to recruit new events  
to the city.  
*Criteria for Evaluation of Event Populations*  
This type of evaluation should be the responsibility of event development agencies and event  
portfolio managers. Without a firm inventory and analysis of the entire event population, deci-  
sions on portfolio balance and diversification, bidding, funding, marketing, and new event  
creation will be impeded.  
l Numbers of events\: start-up and termination data; growth trends; and seasonality.  
l Types\: is there variety, balance, or diversification? targeted to different segments?; managed  
portfolios within different policy domains?  
l Inclusiveness\: affordability; accessibility; awareness levels – by all groups.  
l Sustainability\: green standards implemented; and certification required.  
l Viability and resilience\: funding continuity; committed sponsors.  
l Community support\: demand trends; local action groups; not-for-profit involvement;  
engagement with schools and other institutions.  
l Organisations involved, including the private sector, levels of government, and not-for-profits.  
l Venues for all types; priorities for expansion/modernisation.  
*Evolution and Institutionalisation*  
Organisations have to be created, as in the establishment of a legal corporation or not-for-  
profit society, or they evolve from informal organisations. For example, many professionally  
managed festivals and events have evolved from club-produced events. Once established,  
there can be an evolution towards greater formality, emergence of leadership, and increasing 190  
Event Management Fundamentals  
professionalisation. This trend is reflected in the hiring of professional staff and some degree  
of bureaucratisation, including formal committee systems and strategic planning \(Katz, 1981\).  
Frisby and Getz \(1989\) modelled this hypothetical evolution for festivals, noting that at each  
evolutionary stage, there was a risk of having to return to the previous stage owing to failure,  
or loss of resources. They also suggested that in cities, with larger populations and presumably  
more resources to draw on, festivals were more likely to professionalise.  
Richards and Ryan \(2004\) adapted the Frisby and Getz \(1989\) model by suggesting three axes\:  
\(1\) ‘informal/grassroots resource base’; \(2\) ‘organizational age’; and \(3\) ‘organized public and private  
sector involvement’  
. They argued \(p. 96\) that “being a grassroots event does not preclude the adoption of  
a formal or professional approach to event organisation”  
. Professionalism, they said, can be externally  
imposed on an event organisation.  
Schein’s \(1985\) conceptualisation of the evolution of organisational culture, argued that vari-  
ous crises are likely to occur as the organisation evolves, linked to leadership changes and value  
conflicts, particularly as sub-cultures emerge. Richards and Ryan \(2004\) agreed that various  
crises will accompany event maturation. In their case study, the issues or crises stemmed from  
the need to achieve financial stability, addressing the festival’s cultural orientation and signifi-  
cance, gender issues, the increasing roles of media and sponsors, the representations of groups  
and regions, and tensions between competitive and performative orientations.  
Why do some events, like the Calgary Stampede \(profiled in Getz, 1993b, 1997, 2005\), become  
permanent institutions in their communities? Can all events aspire to this status, and should  
they? One meaning of the word institution is that of “constraints or rules that induce stability in  
human interaction” \(Voss, 2001\). These arise because societies face recurrent problems, so when  
we call an organisation an institution, we are saying that it exists to deal with a fundamental –  
or at least important – social need \(including cultural and economic needs\). Since not all people  
can be directly involved in creating institutions, a set of actors, or stakeholders, has to decide  
on – or establish through repeated interactions or interdependencies – the rules or the organ-  
isations to deal with major social problems. Stability in these institutions has direct benefit  
to the stakeholders, or society as a whole, and should ideally generate increased efficiency in  
resource use.  
The study of institutions is very well established. Selznick \(1957\) distinguished between insti-  
tutions as tools to accomplish specific tasks and institutions to which people formed com-  
mitments. Emile Durkheim \(as reported in Traugott, 1978\) argued that sociological analysis  
should discover the causes, mechanisms, and effects of institutions on societal life. Essentially,  
institutions regularise social life and may foster co-operation and increase efficiency. Applica-  
ble to many festivals, it can also be said that institutions are like public goods in that all mem-  
bers of society may benefit from them, whether or not they contribute to their establishment  
and upkeep. Coleman \(1988, 1990\) believed that institutions are part of what is often called  
social capital. An anthropological perspective \(Sahlins, 1976\) suggests that cultural institutions  
mainly serve symbolic purposes. Another way of looking at institutions is through the lens of  
evolutionary game theory.  
A central focus of the original study of institutions is the evolving relationship between an  
organisation and its environment, which of course includes all its stakeholder interactions.  
‘New institutionalism’, according to Heimer \(2001\), is an outcome of organisational sociology. It  
focuses on the process \(symbolic reasons are emphasised\) by which a practice or structure is  
diffused, becomes a prerequisite for legitimacy \(among key stakeholders\), is taken for granted,  
and is expected. Event Management Fundamentals 191

Figure 8.5 Hypothetical Institutionalisation Process for Events  
*Source\:* Adapted from Getz and Andersson \(2008\)  
By definition, therefore, an event that becomes an institution exists with a specific man-  
date or purpose, is permanent, and fulfils an important social role or solves social problems.  
A community cannot do without its institutions, and when threatened they will receive strong  
support; if they disappear, others will have to be created to carry on their functions. Very few  
events fit these criteria, yet recent research involving a survey of festivals in Sweden sug-  
gests that many festival managers actually believe their event to be an institution \(Getz and  
Andersson, 2008\).  
Figure 8.5 suggests the process by which an event \(as a permanent organisation\) might evolve,  
or strategically plan to become a permanent institution in its community. The key process is  
transitioning from an internal to an external orientation, as many events – especially in their  
early years – are very focussed on their internal processes and internal stakeholders. Relation-  
ships with external stakeholders will probably increase in number and complexity over time,  
and the most important of them can be brought into legal or moral ownership \(through share  
offerings or board directorships\) or other forms of long-term partnership, including spon-  
sorship. It appears that increasing dependency on committed stakeholders is a large part of  
becoming an institution. In other words, independence might have to be sacrificed for sustain-  
ability. The Stampede reflects this evolution, with the City of Calgary owning the land, having  
a permanent representative on the Stampede Board, and assisting the Stampede in its ongoing  
development plans. During the pandemic, a large federal government grant kept it going, and  
a loan guarantee from the city enabled the Stampede Board to secure lower-interest loans to  
help pay off accumulated debt.  
Regarding the organisation as an institution, Scott \(2001\) suggested that it is a social structure  
with a great deal of resilience, it provides meaning to social life, connotes stability, and is taken  
for granted. Others believe an institution has to exist for a specific purpose, which is to achieve  
important societal goals or solve crucial societal problems. 192  
Event Management Fundamentals  
The following criteria appear to be important factors\:  
l An event that is an institution solves important social problems or meets important com-  
munity goals.  
l Society or the community cannot be without it – failure is unthinkable.  
l Permanence is taken for granted.  
l Support is assured – sponsors and agencies will always give it money or other types of  
support.  
l It is highly visible – everyone knows about it – and the event has a strong, positive brand.  
l It is an expert in managing its stakeholder relationships.  
l Key stakeholders have been internalised.  
Whether or not is a worthwhile strategy to pursue, achieving institutional status – at least  
in the minds of key stakeholders – offers considerable benefits within the context of organ-  
isational ecology and theory on competitive advantages. One might argue, however, that it  
is not something that can be attained by design, it has to be earned or bestowed upon the  
organisation.  
PROFILE 8.2  
Research on Values and Event Policy in the Sunshine Coast, Australia  
Researchers employed the use/non-use methodology pioneered in Sweden by  
Andersson and Lundberg \(2013\) and Andersson and Armbrecht \(2014\), with the aim  
of valuing the entire population of events within the Sunshine Coast local authority.  
Getz et al. \(2013\) drew a number of conclusions that can help advance this line of  
research to aid policymaking and strategy for events development \(source\: Getz, D.,  
Gration, D., Raciti, M., Sie, L. and Frost, D. \(2013b\). *Final Report\: Sunshine Coast*  
*Event Portfolios Valuation Research*.\) See also\: Andersson et al., 2017; Gration et al.,  
2016, for details of the theory, research, and conclusions as published in research  
journals.  
The overall purpose of the Sunshine Coast research was to pilot an innovative approach  
to determine the value of portfolios of planned events in a community or destination,  
with implications for policy and strategy making. Both resident and tourist input was  
obtained. Use and non-use values were examined, attempting to create both an eco-  
nomic valuation in monetary amounts and a social perception of the worth of events.  
Researchers at both The University of Queensland and The University of the Sunshine  
Coast collaborated in conducting a pilot survey followed by a large-scale online survey  
of residents and tourists in 2013. Useable responses to the major online survey were  
obtained from 1,085 residents and 384 non-residents.  
The major conclusions are as follows\:  
1 Residents of the Sunshine Coast greatly value their planned events, with substantial  
direct use value accruing from attendance, active participation \(e.g., as athletes and  
artists\), and volunteering.  
2 Residents gave strong recognition to the economic, personal, and social values of  
planned events, regardless of whether they used them or not. Event Management Fundamentals 193  
3 Non-use values recognised by residents included ‘option value’ \(i.e., having more  
to choose from\); *bequest value* \(i.e., valued traditions; creating a legacy for future  
generations; more for youth to do\), and *existence value* \(i.e., events are good for the  
community in multiple ways\).  
4 Residents largely believed that planned events were not causing significant social or  
environmental problems.  
5 From a policy perspective, planned events represented a major field in which both  
economic gain and general public good are being created, with even greater  
potential to grow.  
6 Residents especially supported festivals and cultural celebrations; a range of events  
and event venues were also supported.  
7 There was only limited support among residents to accept tax increases to pay for  
new events or venues. Conclusion? A full justification for new capital expenditures  
and ongoing support should always be provided to residents.  
Implications for policy and strategy\:  
1 Development of a portfolio of planned events and venues should\:  
\(a\) Maximise the joint value of events and venues for both residents and tourists.  
\(b\) Incorporate an events awareness and community benefits communication  
strategy.  
\(c\) Provide a range of celebrations, entertainment, participation, and spectator  
sports that meet contemporary and anticipate emerging needs.  
\(d\) Facilitate direct involvement of residents as organisers, volunteers, athletes,  
and artists.  
\(e\) Develop at least one event into international, hallmark-event status.  
\(f\) Provide ongoing evidence of the benefits events and venues bring to  
residents.  
2 A managed portfolio of events for Sunshine Coast should stress balance by types  
and sizes, and all-year opportunities for celebration and participation.  
Regarding research, it was deemed to be highly desirable to combine regular event  
visitor surveys with specific questions concerning willingness to pay, perceptions of the  
overall attractiveness of events in the destination, and ideas for improvements; ques-  
tions on relationships with residents and the environment would also be useful, in order  
to identify potential problems. Periodic surveys of residents are important in order to  
ask questions similar to those included in the Sunshine Coast research\: willingness to  
pay; different kinds of engagement with events; events attended; preferences for ven-  
ues and events; and perceptions of positive and negative impacts.  
Local authorities, and publicly subsidised events, need to demonstrate the creation  
of *public goods* \(that is, benefits that are realised and appreciated by everyone, or at  
least by all taxpayers\). It is important to be able to show levels of public support and to  
identify and deal with issues raised. Care should be taken to obtain input from specific  
segments of the population that might be excluded through typical survey methods,  
including seniors, youth, and economically disadvantaged groups. 194  
Event Management Fundamentals  
The health \(or sustainability\) of an event population can be measured, in part, by resi-  
dents’ impact perceptions and their changing levels of support for policies and strate-  
gies. For tourists, direct measures of demand and expenditure are useful for evaluating  
overall portfolio health.

# The Learning Organisation and Knowledge Management  
How do organisations learn and retain memory? Senge \(1990, 3\) said, the learning organisation  
is one in which “people continuously expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new  
and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are  
continually learning to learn together” \(also see Senge et al., 1994\). In part, this is a reflection of  
organisational culture, and in part, it can be facilitated through constant research, evaluation, and  
reflection. The open-system model is a good starting point for structuring the learning process.  
Benchmarking against other organisations and specific events is another way by which managers  
learn. To a degree, studying other events is both inevitable and good, but it can and does result  
in copying and standardisation. Proper benchmarking looks at the ways successful organisations  
do things, in other words, their processes or best practices. Getz \(1998a\) studied the searching  
and sharing practices of festival organisers and classified them as being “inward or outward-looking  
organisations”. Searching was either formal or informal in nature, and varied a lot in terms of space  
\(local through international\), substance \(comparisons with similar festivals versus all events\), and  
theoretical \(education\) versus experiential \(learning through visits and conversations\).  
*Knowledge Management*  
Raphaela Stadler’s book Knowledge Management in Event Organisations \(2021\) discusses all the  
relevant theories and methods. Some basic terms\:  
Data\: raw numbers or other forms of facts, on their own lacking meaning.  
Information\: meaning and utility arise from purpose, analysis, and sense-making.  
“Knowledge consists of experience, values, expert insights and contextualizes information that is being put  
into practice by human beings” \(p.3\).  
In managing knowledge for the event or organisation, it is necessary to distinguish between  
tacit knowledge \(being internalised, individual, relational, and context-specific – including skills\)  
and explicit knowledge \(being words and numbers that can easily be communicated\). One of the Event Management Fundamentals 195  
challenges facing event managers is to take advantage of what people know and learn when  
they might be engaged temporarily \(as volunteers or short-term staff\) and from one event to  
another. Documents are easy to produce, but tapping into real experiences and hidden sources  
of knowledge is difficult.  
Stadler defined knowledge management this way \(p. 10\)\:  
The effective use of organisational systems, processes and practices which allow both  
explicit and tacit knowledge to be created, identified, acquired, utilised, shared and  
stored, in order for the organisation to produce a successful event experience and to  
sustain a competitive advantage over time.  
Summarising an entire body of knowledge about knowledge management is difficult, but for  
the purposes of this book, it is useful to present Stadler’s \(p. 173\) recommendations for event  
managers. Organisational learning, in her model, is conceptualised as occurring in three inter-  
dependent stages, as follows\:  
Pre-event\: create a learning culture and suitable organisational structure, with adequate  
resources and training \(this requires a comprehensive and permanent evaluation and impact  
assessment process\).  
During\: create rituals around knowledge sharing, retention, and discussion; focus on learn-  
ing by doing; foster collaboration and empower workers; allocate times to be reflective \(the  
importance of documentation has to be stressed, such as incident reports, customer surveys,  
participant and passive observation, videos\).  
After\: capture both explicit and tacit knowledge, in part by sharing stories \(of success, failures,  
incidents\); retain knowledge workers \(knowledge transfer between one-time events has to be  
facilitated by governing bodies, bidding or funding agencies\).  
# Evaluating the Event Organisation  
Evaluating the organisation as a whole, including its structure, systems, and stakeholder rela-  
tionships is a complex task, although it is often reduced to a simple question of profit versus  
loss, ROI, or the financial ability to continue operations. Taking a long-term perspective on  
resilience and sustainability further complicates the matter.  
There is an applicable model called The Event Compass. It was explained in the fourth edition  
of this book and deserves a summary here. The Event Compass was created to provide an over-  
view of events and their organisations for evaluation and planning purposes. Evaluation of  
the organisation can either be comprehensive or focus on priority areas. Where goals are set  
within each functional area, a measure of goal attainment is made through normal evaluation  
and impact assessment methods. Goal attainment across the functional areas can be compared,  
revealing strengths and weaknesses. For example, it might be determined that the organisation  
is succeeding financially, and meeting its revenue-generating goals, but is weak in terms of cre-  
ating benefits for the community. In this way, a triple-bottom-line approach can be taken. It is  
also desirable to practice the philosophy of continuous improvement, setting ever-higher goals  
and more stringent measures of attainment and overall organisational success.  
STUDY GUIDE  
This chapter introduced the nature of management in generic terms and then identified unique  
aspects of event management. Core management functions were explained, with EMBOK and 196  
Event Management Fundamentals  
MBECS illustrating applications to the events professions. It will be useful to consult the web-  
sites of professional and industry associations to learn more about their training and certifi-  
cation programmes, their conventions, codes of conduct, and career opportunities. Study the  
questions posed concerning the nature of event management and event tourism management.  
These are answered in the book in different places, but not fully. As a research or essay topic,  
pick one of the questions for further exploration, including a scan of both the event litera-  
ture and mainstream management. One of the most important theoretical contributions is  
stakeholder theory, as no event exists without the collaboration of many internal and external  
stakeholders. As well, networking among organisations is of increasing importance, especially  
in light of the pandemic and the need for building greater resilience at the level of individual  
events and managed portfolios. Examine a local event, or one of interest, as to its networks and  
how they are managed. Prepare a simple stakeholder map and think about how each relation-  
ship can be managed.  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Define event management with reference to each of the EMBOK domains.  
l What makes event management unique? How is event tourism management different?  
l Of the various management functions, which one are you most interested in? Explain why  
it can be an attractive area of professional practice and the challenges it poses.  
l In an open-system model, there are two main streams of evaluation and feedback. Describe  
them, and suggest how they might result in conflict.  
l Compare and contrast the three main types of event organisations in terms of governance  
and their business models. Be sure to include a discussion of the value being created for the  
organisation and its constituencies.  
l Why is the revenue side of an event budget often vulnerable to many uncertainties? What  
implications does that fact have for the budget planning process and implementation of the  
event?  
l Consider the population of events in your city or area. Can you describe it \(or a sub-sector  
or portfolio\) in terms of an ecosystem? How would you define and measure its health?  
l Can you identify an event that can be called an institution? What are the defining character-  
istics that make it an institution?  
l Describe how the learning organisation depends on knowledge creation and management.

Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
# Introduction  
The directing function covers a number of inter-related topics, starting with leadership.  
Who gives purpose to the organisation, how decisions are made, supervision, and the exer-  
cise of power are central questions. These all relate back to the organisation’s ownership and  
mandate, and how it is structured – hierarchical versus flat being major considerations. We  
also consider organisational culture, which often stems from founders and the original man-  
date. The learning organisation and knowledge management have previously been introduced.  
The second major section covers human resource management, starting with a discussion of  
unique considerations for events, and leading to an overview of education and careers in event  
management.  
# Leadership  
The who and how of directing an organisation or event generally starts with ownership and  
mandate, as discussed in the previous chapter. In a small, private business, the owner or own-  
ers provide direction and leadership. The same happens when one person sets up an event  
organisation, being the founder, and for a length of time directs its evolution. Over time, and  
with professionalisation, a formal structure is established, and \(typically\) Boards of Directors  
take over. They and their senior staff, the CEO, provide leadership and direct operations. In the  
public sector, events are usually within departments and agencies, so leadership might be com-  
plicated and bureaucratic. Whatever the context, an event or organisation without competent,  
dedicated leadership will sooner or later experience trouble.  
*Leadership Styles and Roles*  
The various schools of theory on leadership have been identified by Dulewicz and Higgs  
\(2005\), namely\:  
1 The trait school\: what personality traits are exhibited by people we recognise as leaders in the  
event management field?  
2 The behavioural school\: what do leaders do that makes them effective?  
3 The contingency school\: are good leaders flexible and adaptable?  
4 The visionary school\: who has a long-term vision for the event? for our profession? how is  
innovation fostered?  
5 The emotional intelligence school; are good leaders empathetic? team players?  
6 The competency school\: what is the knowledge base, how is it best taught, and what skills are  
necessary?  
Abson \(2017\) asked\: “What do effective leaders do in the world of festivals and events?” She suggested  
that effective event leaders perform certain tasks, as adapted for Figure 9.1.  
Abson also cautioned,  
…That event managers believe that it is not the technical skills \(such as financial  
planning, event design\) that ensure successful event delivery but rather that it is  
the soft skills and the human resource that drive successful events.…in order to be

Figure 9.1 What Effective Event Leaders Do  
*Source\:* Adapted from Abson \(2017\)  
Senge \(1990\) argued that leadership is not about one’s position or role – it is not the same as  
being a boss. Leaders and managers can be two quite different things, although a good manager  
who is passionate about excellence can also be a leader. Leading literally means to step ahead or  
move forward \(presumably with followers\), and Senge equates this with creativity and vision.  
Leaders have a purpose and are passionate about their work. They care for people. Senge’s  
perspective on leadership reinforces the view of events as agents of change. He pointed to the  
importance of community-level leadership, and therefore event managers should look to their  
broader roles in helping to shape the future of society.  
In the vast literature on leadership, you will find many models, but one that is frequently cited  
is called full-range leadership. Avolio \(2010\) suggested that the most effective leaders need a  
repertoire of styles, and the laissez-fairs style \(i.e., doing nothing while expecting results\) is  
not an option.  
Servant leadership reflects the philosophy that leaders, whether they be owners or managers,  
have a responsibility to do good for everyone in the organisation, and those affected by it.  
They are servants, stewards of resources, facilitators of well-being, and creators of positive  
change. In other words, it is an ideal. Power in this ideal is not exerted in a top-down fash-  
ion, but democratic. Bottom-up decision-making is put into practice. This style seems most  
appropriate in the public and not-for-profit sectors where event-producing organisations exist  
as agents of change, or as providers of specific messages and services to target segments and  
communities.  
Autocratic Leadership is centred on the boss, who holds all authority and responsibility. Leaders  
make decisions on their own without consulting subordinates. We can see this in small and  
family owned businesses, where it is necessary, and it goes with the hands-on, be-my-own boss  
attitude of many entrepreneurs.  
Charismatic Leadership\: People follow them because of their personality or attractiveness, or  
perhaps because of their message. This style involves a transformation of followers’ values and 200  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
beliefs. Leaders do not have to be charismatic, but in many circumstances, it helps in attracting  
followers.  
Democratic Leadership\: In this leadership style, subordinates are involved in making decisions.  
In some societies consensus building is essential – no matter how long it takes. This style can  
be merged with the principles of value co-creation within stakeholder networks. It is compat-  
ible with servant leadership.  
Transactional Leadership\: Focusing on the lower-order needs identified by Maslow, this style of  
leadership promotes compliance and the status quo. Performance standards will be specified  
and evaluated, and workers will be rewarded or punished according to their performance.  
Transformational Leadership\: Unlike other leadership styles, transformational leadership is all  
about initiating change in organisations, groups, oneself, and others. Transformational lead-  
ers motivate others to do more than they originally intended, and often even more than they  
thought possible. They set more challenging expectations and typically achieve higher perfor-  
mance. Transformational leaders empower followers.  
Little research has been conducted on leadership styles in event management. One study, by  
Megheirkouni \(2018\), was able to link transformational behaviour to rational decision-making  
in large-scale sport events. Leigh, Lamont, and Cairncross \(2013\) found that Australian man-  
agers lacked the resources to outsource volunteer training, so they relied on transactional and  
transformational leadership styles.  
Senge \(1990\) specified three leadership roles necessary for creation of a learning organisation\:  
being the leader as designer \(i.e., creating a common vision with shared values and purpose;  
designing policies, strategies, and structures; creating the learning processes aimed at fostering  
continuous improvement\); as teacher or coach; and as steward \(similar to the servant leader\).  
These can be framed within transformational leadership theory.  
Leadership is the pivotal role of managers \(Mintzberg, 1994\) and boards of directors. Of course,  
in many small organisations and informal events, everyone chips in as needed, in which case  
leadership is somewhat of a collective process. Leadership in events requires the setting of a  
vision, developing strategies and goals, and inspiring everyone to work together towards those  
goals. Oakley and Krug \(1991\) believed that creative leaders not only empower their workers  
but also take responsibility for all the decisions made by workers; they focus on goals and results,  
and are both current and future-oriented. Group leadership, where no one dominates and all  
decisions are taken democratically, is an alternative approach, but difficult to implement –  
especially in projects where rapid decision-making is necessary. Events typically require both  
artistic and management leadership. An over-emphasis on business might stifle artistic innova-  
tion, whereas an over-emphasis on creativity might compromise the event’s financial viability.  
Leadership ability is essential for owners and founders of events, but leadership skills come  
to the fore and have to be learned, as workers become supervisors and progress to become  
managers. Technical skills and hands-on operations have to give way to people skills such as  
motivating and problem-solving. At the highest management levels, conceptual knowledge  
\(theory\) is needed, as well as the ability to formulate visions, goals, and strategies, alongside  
research and evaluation skills.  
Power and leadership go together. Owners of companies and events typically have the legal power  
to compel obedience, just as in the military. Boards of directors can use legal power to enforce  
their policies. Managers often have ‘legitimate’ power \(Mintzberg, 1983\) by virtue of their  
position to direct or coerce the actions of subordinates. Other sources of power identified by Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events Mintzberg include ‘reward power’ \(the ability to bestow or withhold tangible and intangible  
rewards\), ‘expert power’ \(people follow because of superior knowledge or ability\), ‘information  
power’ \(obtained through control of vital information\) and ‘referent power’ \(stemming from loy-  
alty and admiration\). Power and knowledge are inseparable, according to Stadler \(2013\), drawing  
from the theories of Foucault \(1969, 1982\). With regard to community festivals, Clarke and  
Jepson \(2011\) looked at how a steering committee exercised power in restricting knowledge  
within the community. Their exercise of power resulted in the community not being able to  
feel ownership of the festival.  
201  
*Entrepreneurs \(Social and Private\) and Intrapreneurs*  
How are events initiated? Somebody or some organisation has to take the initiative, and this  
leadership can continue well into the lifespan of the event and its organisation. The term  
entrepreneur is not easy to define, and there are two major schools of thought about entrepre-  
neurship\: that it is a personality trait held by rather unique persons, or that it is one or more  
actions that can be observed and measured. Furthermore, entrepreneurship can apply to per-  
sonal business ventures or to social situations.  
The personality trait theory suggests that entrepreneurs are born, not made. Some people are  
compelled \(or have an inborn propensity\) to create businesses or events, seek out oppor-  
tunities that others ignore \(especially in terms of finding a niche in the marketplace\), pull  
together resources \(often through personal networking\), take personal risks and \(but not  
necessarily\) create personal wealth. Innovation or creativity is often thought to be inherent  
in entrepreneurs, and this is certainly evident among those who establish festivals and other  
events.  
Being one’s own boss, or wanting to take a hands-on approach to work, is also a personality  
trait clearly associated with people who start up new businesses or events. Entrepreneurs are  
not discouraged by failures and often bounce back from a failure to try again. Serial entrepreneurs  
keep starting new ventures in a rather restless fashion, which leads some observers to think of  
them as socially dysfunctional or psychologically disturbed.  
If the motivations driving entrepreneurs are mostly personal, or connected to family values  
and goals, they are clearly within the realm of business and microeconomics. But there is little  
doubt that social entrepreneurs are very active in the arts, leading to establishment of many not-  
for-profit festivals and events. A social entrepreneur might also work within governmental or  
not-for-profit organisations to create profit \(or profitable events\) to be used for social projects.  
Cause-related events can be created this way.  
New venture creation is the starting point for discussing entrepreneurship as an observable activ-  
ity. Starting up an event could be motivated by the desire for profit, or social good. Risks are  
inherent in this process, especially when it comes to acquiring and spending one’s own, and  
other people’s money. Reputations are also at stake. The entrepreneur’s personal network can  
be vital at this start-up stage, and in the subsequent years when vital support and resources  
have to be sustained through effective stakeholder management.  
Intrapreneurship  
Within organisations intrapreneurship can be a valuable process, but it usually has to be fostered.  
Can a whole organisation, or a group within, really behave as if they were private entrepre-  
neurs? The object would be to encourage innovation, hopefully leading to higher profits or 202  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
other forms of corporate effectiveness. In this context, it is possible to establish new events,  
or bid on them, within a government or tourist agency. Another application would be within  
an event production company that wants to stay ahead of the competition, or within a large  
corporation that sponsors or produces its own events. Often it is necessary to set up spe-  
cific intrapreneurial units to achieve these corporate goals, and such units need leadership. By  
nature, persons attracted to government and corporate employment might be lacking in those  
entrepreneurial traits necessary for innovation. Or at least they might lack experience in new  
venture creation. In such cases, there is a serious risk of creating a culture clash.  
*Organisational Culture and Founders*  
Culture in general is based on shared beliefs, values, practices, or attitudes, and it is a concept  
of importance to companies and other organisations. Schein \(1985\) defined organisational  
culture as\:  
A pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group learned as it solved its problems  
of external adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to be  
considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way you  
perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.  
In a strong, resilient culture, everyone works together towards common goals because they  
share the vision and underlying values of the organisation. This is where event founders have  
the greatest influence, in establishing the core values, but this unity of purpose can fade with  
time. In other organisations, recruitment, indoctrination, and compulsory conformity to norms  
ensure that values are preserved, but at the cost of individual choice and expression. In both  
situations, if everyone thinks the same way – called groupthink – there is a serious risk that  
innovation will be stifled.  
According to Schein, an observer can assess organisational culture by first identifying super-  
ficial but ‘tangible attributes’ such as facilities, rewards, dress, and interactions. The ‘professed  
culture’ of an organisation is reflected in its mission statements, codes of conduct, public state-  
ments, and the expressed values and attitudes of members. At the third and deepest level are  
an organisation’s “tacit or unseen assumptions”. They can be unspoken rules, guiding behaviour  
and decisions in a taken-for-granted manner. The researcher might have to spend a lot of time  
within an organisation to come to any conclusion about its deepest cultural values. That also  
applies to staff and volunteers in some settings.  
There is no doubt that organisations evolve in terms of their culture, and this affects other  
management functions in profound ways. Getz \(1993a\) observed that festival organisations  
exhibited life-cycle dynamics, and that festival founders did shape their culture. Several fes-  
tivals in Calgary were seen to have experienced cultural crises, such as changes in strategic  
direction, which occurred when founders were replaced by newcomers. It can be gradual, or  
suddenly provoking a crisis.  
O’Toole and Mikolaitis \(2002\) emphasised the importance of understanding culture when  
producing corporate events. Such events have to ‘fit’ in terms of company values, goals, poli-  
tics, and style. But despite the importance of culture within mainstream management theory  
and practice, there have been few event-related studies published that are informed by this  
concept. One example \(Stadler, Reid, and Fullager, 2013\) explored organisational culture and  
­ knowledge management in the Queensland Music Festival. Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events 203  
# Decision-Making and Accountability  
Decision-making styles and structures will follow from ownership, mandate, culture, and lead-  
ership, with the most basic distinctions existing between top-down and autocratic on the one  
hand, and bottom-up, democratic on the other. Both are found within the events sector, with  
not-for-profits typically being more democratic because of their greater dependence on volun-  
teers as workers and leaders. Within any organisation, a number of pertinent issues have to be  
resolved, as discussed below.  
Who can make decisions, and under what circumstances? This is an easy question to answer  
for small, private businesses – the owners! It is more complex in larger organisations, pulsating  
events, and events with multiple organisations collaborating to plan and produce it. Without  
explicit rules, decision-making could either result in conflict, or nothing gets done. In team-  
work, the right to make certain decisions is delegated to the team collectively, not the team  
leader \(see Professor Goldblatt’s Expert Opinion in Chapter 1\). Related questions include how  
decisions are communicated, and who else should be consulted before making them. This is  
also an important element in establishing governance and organisational structure.  
What decisions have to be made? More sophisticated organisations will have a decisions inven-  
tory, whereas, in the events world, it is more likely that the task inventory will be the guiding  
feature. Every task has to be assigned, leading to the need for related decisions. How should  
decision-making be informed and supported? Research, evaluation, impact assessment, and  
stakeholder input are all intended to inform decisions, as in the learning organisation. These  
are functions to be assigned to individuals or teams, and in some cases outsourced to consul-  
tants. How is accountability assured? When decisions are made, someone or a team is to be  
held accountable, and this should be made explicit in rules and procedures, or policy manuals.  
Ultimately senior leadership takes responsibility, and those people want to know that they  
will not be surprised, embarrassed, or stymied by lower-order decision-making. This is related  
to the principle of distributed authority wherein the rights \(or obligations\) to make decisions  
are delegated to persons and teams. If all decisions have to be made by one person, such as  
an owner, then there is no delegation. Teamwork to produce an event can be made easier and  
more efficient if teams have delegated authority to get certain tasks accomplished. Is everyone,  
and are all teams, unified in purpose and direction? This is an essential task for leaders, that  
is, achieving unity of purpose and action, and is made easier if the organisation has a learning,  
democratic, and committed culture.  
Decision-making tools\: A range of tools exist for decision-makers \(see Table 9.1\) starting with  
research, evaluation, and impact assessment as discussed elsewhere in this book. Many online  
sources are available, such as the decision matrix \(https\://asq.org/quality-resources/­ decision-  
matrix\) which is a tool for evaluating and prioritising a range of options.  
Supervision usually refers to staffing, with managers having responsibility for those serving in  
particular teams, departments, or units. From a structural perspective, it relates to the degree  
of flatness. In a flat organisation teams or front-line workers are empowered to make certain deci-  
sions without close supervision. There is no middle management required, and the top managers  
or CEO can communicate directly with front-line workers. Task assignments are also easier in  
a flat organisation, especially when teams are able to deliver programmes or services with-  
out worrying about detailed job descriptions or close supervision from above. Note that task  
analysis is important for budgeting, scheduling, and HR needs assessment. Internal communica-  
tions are better facilitated within flat as opposed to hierarchical organisations, especially within 204

teams. The more managers there are, the more formal the communication process becomes,  
as each supervisor wants to be informed quickly and fully, then up-the-ladder the information  
has to flow.  
Policy, Rules, and Regulations\: Bureaucratic and hierarchical organisations require detailed  
policies, rules, and regulations to govern and supervise employees. The policy manual will prob-  
ably grow in size and complexity as the organisation grows and matures, and also in line  
with its scale. The entire set of policies, rules, and regulations can be transferred from one  
mega-event to the next, with suitable adaptations. For small, flat event organisations, less is  
undoubtedly better, with teams deciding how to operate on their own. Nevertheless, policies  
are an essential part of governance, even if they are implicit rather than written in stone. When  
events are won through bidding, notably sports, the producers are usually presented with a set  
of detailed specifications that will govern much of the planning and operations. If they do not fit  
the event producer’s way of doing things, negotiation will be required. 206  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
# Human Resource Management  
In this section, we start by examining the basic HR management tasks and a number of  
unique considerations for events, with Table 9.2 summarising this discussion. The HR plan-  
ning ­ process is outlined, followed by a number of topics of particular importance, including  
­ motivation, both staff and volunteers, well-being, and satisfaction. We then look at careers  
in event management, commencing with the nature of professionalism, including ethics, and  
how event management is being professionalised. The final sub-section examines careers, with  
examples, and the changing nature of work and careers.  
Lynn Van der Wagen \(2006\: preface\) in the book Human Resource Management for Events\: Managing  
the Event Workforce, emphasised that\: “There is no more challenging environment for human resource  
management than the event business”. She showed how the challenges stem from a combination of  
the importance people assign to events, the nature of project planning and management, the  
numerous stakeholders to consider, and the risks associated with every aspect of event pro-  
duction. It also must be emphasised that numerous events have very unique challenges arising  
from reliance on volunteers.  
The event workforce, as discussed by Parent and Ruetsch \(2021\) in the context of sport events,  
consists of the following\:  
l Employees\: paid, either full-time or part-time; all year or part.  
l Consultants\: paid for special expertise, short or long-term, part or full-time.  
l Contractors\: paid for special services, such as supplies.  
l Secondees\: short or long-term workforce members paid by their originating employer; they  
are on loan to the organisers.  
l Volunteers\: short- or long-term, unpaid; the organisation might be completely managed by  
volunteers; rewards or perks for volunteers can sometimes be important, but recognition of  
effort and skill is essential.  
Pulsating event organisations are quite different from government agencies or private companies  
in that they exist solely to produce a periodic event and do not employ any full-time staff, or  
maintain only a minimum number to keep the organisation intact. Near to the time of the event  
they have to build the workforce, both paid and volunteers, and then dismiss most of them.  
Workers need to know in advance how this works, and the work conditions, or serious prob-  
lems will arise. Pulsating organisations can have problems with recruitment, as many workers  
will not be available next time around, and with training during a very short period of time.  
It remains to be seen how the pandemic changed this situation in any way, with the problem  
being that many workers might have left the profession.  
*HR Planning Process*  
Getz \(2005\) and van der Wagen \(2006\) both provided detailed HR planning models. Van  
der Wagen’s approach starts with the event’s purpose and strategic plan, and integrates HR  
within project planning and across all the functional areas – from accreditation to workforce  
planning. Key steps include\: an HR strategic plan; work breakdown structure; assessment  
of labour needs, forecast versus supply assessment \(considering paid staff, volunteers, and  
contractors\); risk assessment; HR operational plan and budget; recruitment and selection;  
training; staffing logistics; performance management; recognition and reward system; and  
post-event evaluation. Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events 207

HR Management FunctionsUnique Considerations in the Event Sector  
Needs assessment, task analysis,  
–  
*pulsating events* require a quick, large build-up near  
and job descriptions  
to when the event occurs; volunteers and part-time  
employees are relied upon  
–  
permanent event organisations need all-year  
staffing  
–  
task analysis is covered in Project Planning  
–  
job descriptions for employees will be categorically  
different from those of volunteers; employees  
require details on work conditions, pay, hours, and  
obligations  
–  
applicants and ongoing employees or volunteers  
have to be matched to teams, venues, or tasks  
Recruiting\: advertising;  
interviewing; background checks;  
motivation and incentives  
–  
word of mouth recruiting through existing  
staff and volunteers; drawing on links with  
sponsors, co-producers, suppliers, allies  
–  
many positions in events are highly sensitive,  
requiring specific skill sets and a high degree  
of professionalism  
Orientation and indoctrination;  
engagement  
–  
ideally, event staff are professionals with the  
appropriate skill set, attitudes, and commitment  
to the organisation, but orienting new staff  
and volunteers, including indoctrination to the  
organisation’s values and policies, in a short  
period of time, will be difficult  
Training, coaching, and  
career development  
–  
event careers often entail moving from one event  
to another, or among different types of organisation  
and events; basic knowledge and skills should  
be transferable, but on-the-job training is likely  
necessary; coaching newcomers is important,  
and is different from supervision  
Supervision; teamwork–  
not all workers will be used to, or comfortable with  
teamwork and minimal supervision; this needs to be  
discussed at the recruitment and training stages  
Performance evaluation; rewards  
–  
and discipline  
it is difficult to discipline volunteers, but there have  
to be standards and ethics applied, evaluations  
performed, and sometimes rewards/punishment,  
even termination; paid staff expect this; evaluation  
and reward/discipline might occur at the team level  
Pay and benefits; well-being–  
event careers are difficult, rewards are often less  
than in the private sector, and work challenges can  
result in dissatisfaction, injury, poor health, or stress;  
worker well-being has become a priority  
Retention; succession–  
preparing and selecting workers for promotion  
or leadership roles falls on owners and senior  
managers, but the types of evaluation employed  
can be critical, for example, all-round evaluation  
within teams; keeping the best workers is difficult in  
pulsating organisations, as is passing on knowledge 208  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
Hanlon and Stewart \(2006\) conducted a study of staffing for a major sport event organisation,  
raising the question of what strategies are best. A mix of full-time, outsourced, seasonal, and  
volunteer personnel might be involved. A complex structural arrangement can exist, numbers  
fluctuate, and everyone is on a defined-term contract. Temporary work teams are one solution.  
Hanlon and Stewart made a number of recommendations for strategy, documentation, and  
practice. Legal and ethical issues will inevitably arise for events, including laws applying to  
who can be hired, on what basis applicants can be rejected \(certain questions or security checks  
might not be permitted\) or employees terminated. Another common issue is the reality and  
appearance of discrimination, especially on boards of directors, and the desirability of having  
staff and volunteers reflect the social and cultural mix of the community.  
*Motivation and Reward*  
Several theoretical approaches can be applied to the task of recruiting and motivating event  
workers.  
Herzberg’s two-factor theory\: It is sometimes called the “motivator-hygiene theory”. Herzberg’s  
workplace studies \(1966\) caused him to conclude that ‘hygiene factors’ like salary, security, and  
other benefits, do not motivate people but can cause dissatisfaction. What motivates people to  
work \(or work better\) are challenges, recognition, and responsibility. One adaptation of this  
theory is its use to explain customer or guest satisfaction. In this context, hygiene factors like  
inadequate toilets, parking problems, or long waits, cause dissatisfaction but do not motivate  
people to attend events or lead to perceptions of overall quality.  
McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y\: Managers who believe \(consciously or instinctively\) in ‘Theory  
X’ think that workers are inherently lazy, so structure and discipline \(or the threat of pun-  
ishment\) are needed to motivate them. This is in accord with Skinner’s \(1938\) “behavioural  
modification” approach, requiring reward and discipline, linking to transactional leadership as  
discussed previously. McGregor \(1960\) determined that at higher levels of Maslow’s hierarchy,  
praise, respect, recognition, empowerment and a sense of belonging are far more powerful  
motivators than money. Accordingly, in ‘Theory Y’ a manager tries to remove barriers to cre-  
ativity and self-fulfilment, provide a comfortable work environment, and treat employees or  
volunteers with a great deal of respect. Transformational leadership is in line with this thinking.  
Vroom’s expectancy theory \(Vroom, 1964\) states that workers have a variety of goals \(particularly  
to avoid pain and experience pleasure\) and that they can be motivated if they believe that there  
is a positive correlation between efforts and performance, that favourable performance will  
result in an outcome, that the outcome’s value to the employee can be determined, and that the  
desire to satisfy the need is strong enough to make the effort worthwhile. It is sometimes called  
“expectancy-valence theory”, where ‘valence’ refers to the emotional orientations people hold with  
respect to outcomes.  
*Volunteers*  
No one would challenge the idea that volunteers have been, and will remain absolutely critical  
in the production of all types of planned events. Even for-profit and corporate events often  
rely on unpaid workers, although there might be extrinsic motivators in play as well – such  
as peer pressure or fear of recrimination. Studying event volunteers has been a major theme,  
with primary topics being volunteer motivation, recruitment and training, managing the vol-  
unteer effort, and integrating volunteers with paid staff. Volunteering is not uniformly valued Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events and practiced around the world, being in part a reflection of cultural norms, political systems,  
economic conditions, and living standards. Generic information is available from many coun-  
tries on who volunteers, why, and for what \(see, for example\: Imagine Canada; https\://www.  
imaginecanada.ca/en\). In the UK, see Volunteering Matters \(https\://volunteeringmatters.org.  
uk/about-us/\).  
Volunteer management for events requires specialised knowledge within HR, as well as  
event-specific strategies and practices, reflecting both the size and nature of the event. A lot of  
research has been conducted on the Olympics, but those findings are not necessarily applicable  
to small events or other types. Specific to events, a growing body of research evidence exists on  
volunteer motivation, satisfaction, commitment, and experience. Studies include those by\: Wil-  
liams and Harrison \(1988\); Ryan and Bates \(1995\); Williams et al. \(1995\); Elstad \(1997, 2003,  
2009\); Farrell et al. \(1998\); Green and Chalip \(1998, 2004\); Saleh and Wood \(1998\); John-  
ston et al. \(2000\); Coyne and Coyne \(2001\); Strigas and Newton-Jackson \(2003\); Leigh et al.  
\(2013\); Ralston et al. \(2005\); Monga \(2006\); Bendle and Patterson \(2008\); Lockstone and Baum  
\(2009\); Bang, Alexandris and Ross \(2009\); Bang, Won and Kim \(2009\); Fairley et al. \(2013\);  
Neufeind et al. \(2013\); Gallarza et al. \(2013\); Allen and Bartle \(2014\); Treuren \(2014\); Bach-  
man et al. \(2016\); Blackman et al. \(2017\); Dickson et al. \(2017\); Holmes et al. \(2018\); Jiang  
et al. \(2018\); Mahadevan \(2018a\); Smith et al. \(2019\); Cain et al. \(2021\); ­ Sisson \(2021\); Liang  
et al. \(2022\); Power and Nedvetskaya \(2022\); Dickson and Darcy \(2022\); Liu and Jia \(2022\),  
Diop et al. \(2022\), and Lachance et al. \(2022\).  
An extensive review of the research literature on event volunteering was published by Smith,  
Lockstone-Binney and Holmes, K. \(2019\). Their review identified the main themes, such as  
volunteer motivation, experience, future intentions, and volunteer legacy. They pointed to a  
rather narrow focus on certain event types and common methodologies and called for the lens  
of more critical theory, attention to the volunteering legacy, and contributions to communities.  
Underlying motivation to volunteer for events can include generic motivations like doing good  
\(altruism\), looking for social and career benefits \(networking\), and challenges. Volunteers par-  
ticularly enjoy the belonging and sharing, or communitas that can occur through their event  
experiences. Volunteering can also be one manifestation of serious leisure, and it is clear that  
some people volunteer at many events. Those who have a great experience at an event are likely  
to become motivated to volunteer at others. Involvement in a sport leads to volunteering at  
sport events of the same type. The prestige of an event makes a big difference, with community  
pride being an important factor. Monga \(2006\) concluded that multiple motivations apply to  
event volunteers, but that affiliation reasons, or attachment to the event’s theme or activity,  
are strongest.  
Indoctrination, training, and supervision all have to be directed towards service quality and the  
participation of all staff, volunteers, and suppliers in the facilitation of designed experiences.  
A serious question to be asked is the degree to which satisfactory staff/volunteer/supplier  
experiences contribute to guest and other stakeholder experiences. This is much more than a  
service quality issue, as it gets to the heart of how experiences are shaped.  
209  
*Well-being and Sustainable HR*  
The pandemic brought staff and volunteer well-being to the fore, firstly as a health issue -  
to prevent the spread of disease – then with regard to the impacts on jobs, wages, work-  
ing conditions, and related stress. A larger issue concerns structural changes in employment  
and working conditions that might affect the events sector, making existing conditions worse. 210  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
Problems with HR management in the events sector have long been recognised. As Baum  
\(2006\) observed, “Factors such as low pay, unpredictable working times, as well as long and difficult hours  
have been recognized as key issues in the events industry leading to high levels of employee turnover, which  
are not sustainable”.  
Stadler, Walters, and Jepson \(2022\) discussed sustainable HRM and its relationship with stress,  
mental health, burnout, and the general well-being of employees and volunteers. Unique  
­ conditions within the events sector have to be considered, including the pulsating nature of  
many events, temporary employment, a heterogeneous workforce, uncertainty about the future,  
long hours, and difficult working conditions. While there is no consensus on what exactly  
sustainable human resource management is, the underlying principles include a ­ long-term  
perspective on outcomes and processes to achieve not only financial success but also a focus  
on human and social needs.  
Research by Stadler et al. \(2022\) identified major themes that should be considered to ensure  
well-being. The first was “open and inclusive communication and relationships” as opposed to manage-  
ment that appears to not care. Theme two was the need for flexible working, taking into account  
workload and conditions that can cause stress or ill health. Third was “empathetic long-term sup-  
port and growth”, including openness about future prospects and commitment to the long-term  
care of employees. These themes argue for more collaborative and open management styles.  
Satisfaction and haPPineSS  
Muskat and Mair \(2021, 37\) explored the links between job satisfaction and unique aspects  
of event organisations, including the pulsating nature of most planned events and the nature  
of the work itself. It is often temporary, fast-paced, and short in duration, meaning “...it can  
be very difficult for event organisations to attract and retain high performing permanent and casual staff,  
as well as volunteers for this fast-paced work environment”. An additional complication is the use of  
teamwork and the fact that many teams are heterogeneous in terms of demographics, values,  
experience levels, and skills. All these factors shape motivation and influence job satisfaction  
and retention. Managers must consider how unpaid volunteers are different from paid staff,  
both casual \(part-time\) and permanent. Over time, high stress levels might very well alter  
­ satisfaction and require different forms of motivation and reward.  
EXPERT OPINION 9.1\: By Professor Tommy Andersson  
Happiness Research and Event Tourism  
Tommy D. Andersson, PhD, is professor emeritus in Tourism and Hospitality management  
at the Center for Tourism in the School of Business, Economics, and Law at Gothen-  
burg University, Sweden, where he has worked since 2001. His main research interests  
are event management, managerial economics of the hospitality industry, ­ subjective  
well-being, and food tourism. His publications are mainly in the areas of Event Manage-  
ment, Food Tourism, and recently, Happiness and Event Participation.  
Happiness research has an unusual history. It was a central issue for Ancient Greek  
philosophers more than 2,400 years ago. Aristippus of Cyrene, who lived in the fourth  
century BC, proposed that you become happy by enjoying as much fun, good food and  
drink as possible with a minimum of effort. This is today known as *hedonic happiness*. Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events 211  
Aristotle, who also lived in the fourth century BC opposed this view of happiness and  
claimed that you become happy when you develop yourself to achieve your true poten-  
tial even if this may require effort from you. Your true self is called *daemon* in Greek and  
this type of happiness is therefore known as *eudaemonic happiness*.  
Happiness remained an exclusive issue for philosophers and religious thinkers for  
more than two millennia but about 50 years ago a branch of psychology, known as  
­ *positive psychology*, took an empirical interest in this area of research. One reason  
for this renewed interest was a very ingenious measure of happiness suggested by  
Diener \(1984\) and called subjective well-being \(swb\). This measure leaves it to the  
respondent to define happiness as well as to assess how happy they are by answering  
one simple question\: “Taking all into consideration, how happy are you with your life?”  
and answers are given as a number between 0 \(extremely unhappy\) and 10 \(extremely  
happy\). Thus, there are good reasons to call this measure *SWB* and arguably happiness  
is very subjective. Only the respondent can assess both what happiness means to them  
and how happy they are.  
Based on the swb question, a lot of empirical research has been undertaken. First  
by positive psychologists but later followed by researchers from many academic dis-  
ciplines. Among the important results from psychological research is a categorisation  
of three causes of happiness \(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005\). The largest share is explained  
by the “set-point” which depends on stable factors such as your inherited personality  
which is a base for your happiness throughout your life. This explains about 50% of the  
variation in happiness. Another stable factor explaining 10% is called the “circumstan-  
tial” factor and depends e.g., on the society you live in and your family. The remaining  
40% depends on “intentional activities” which you undertake to make life happy such  
as attending a music event or taking a tourist trip.  
Positive psychologists are called positive since they place less emphasis on how to treat  
mentally ill people and more emphasis on finding out how ordinary people can live bet-  
ter lives. Therefore, happiness is a central issue and some of the frequently cited ways  
to become happy are\:  
*Physical exercising\:* Fox \(1999\) surveyed research results in this area and found that  
exercise improves mental well-being through improved mood and self-perception.  
*Command of material resources\:* Income and wealth have been debated and ­ empirical  
data suggest that there is “decreasing marginal utility” i.e., if you are poor, this will  
affect your ­ happiness negatively but if you are very rich you are not ­ necessarily more  
happy than “normally” wealthy people are \(Diener and biswas- diener, 2002\).  
*Goal achievement\:* If you have goals in life, that you make significant progress  
towards ­ achieving, is a factor closely related to Aristotle’s ideas of *eudaimonea*.  
Studies have indicated that ­ personal goal achievement is one of the highest moti-  
vators to participate in competitions and promote happiness \(Maxcy, Wicker, and  
Prinz, 2019\).  
*Social relations and friendship \(relatedness\)\:* The importance of warm, trusting, and  
supportive interpersonal relationships for well-being has been underlined within  
positive psychology. To have friends who one can rely on generates eudaemonic  
happiness \(Argyle, 2013; Myers, 2003\). 212  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
Another finding from psychological research is the dynamics of happiness as described  
by the homeostatic model \(Cummins, 1998\), also known as the “*hedonic treadmill*”  
model, which describes how you tend to get back to your “set-point” value as time  
goes by. People who have won a lot of money in a lottery are very happy, but after a few  
months, they tend to be back at their “set-point” level of happiness. The same applies  
to people who have had serious accidents and risk spending the rest of their lives in a  
wheelchair. They are very unhappy after the accident but after a few months, they are  
back at their set-point value.  
By attending intentional activities such as events, you will increase your happiness for  
some time but then get back to your set-point until you enjoy the next positive inten-  
tional activity. An active life will most of the time give you more happiness than your  
basic set-point level of happiness. But just like a treadmill, you need to continue your  
active life or fall back to your set-point level of happiness.  
Events provide opportunities to make participants happier in several ways, which also  
has been confirmed by empirical studies. Participation in sport events, such as long-distance  
running, stimulates physical exercise, goal achievement, and to some extent  
also social relations \(see Plate 9.1\).  
A study of participants in a half-marathon race in Sweden showed that participants,  
on average, are not only happier than the country average but also that happiness  
increases with the number of races they have participated in throughout their running  
career \(Lundberg and Andersson, 2022\). Another study of an endurance race in Spain  
found the same results \(Almeida-Santana, Moreno-Gil, and Andersson, 2022\).

Tourism events fit well as examples of intentional activities pursued to increase the level  
of happiness, and this area of empirical studies is expected to develop rapidly. So far,  
most studies have been performed on participants at sports events, but it would be  
interesting to know more about what effects different types of events, such as music  
events, carnivals, and festivals have on the happiness of the participants.

*HR Evaluation*  
Getz \(2018, 103\) provided goals and sample Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) to be used  
in HR evaluation for events. The first, and probably most important, is to meet ISO stan-  
dards. ISO 30414\:2018 is entitled Human Resource Management – Guidelines For Internal  
And External Human Capital Reporting, and covers the following\:  
l Compliance and ethics.  
l Costs.  
l Diversity.  
l Leadership.  
l Organisational culture.  
l Productivity.  
l Recruitment, mobility, and turnover.  
l Skills and capabilities.  
l Succession planning. 214  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
l Workforce availability.  
l Organisational health, safety, and well-being.  
A separate standard exists \(ISO 30415\:2021\) for Diversity and Inclusion.  
Other recommended goals and KPIs by Getz \(2018, 135–156\) are given for each of the stages  
and major elements in the HR management process\: planning and management; organisational  
design; recruitment and training; wrap-up. Some of these KPIs are\:  
l A satisfied, committed workforce; satisfy staff and volunteer needs \(i.e., well-being\).  
l Reduced turnover; high levels of commitment and retention.  
l Fill all positions with competent workers; reduce related costs.  
l Conduct annual self-evaluations and supervisor reports on all workers; measure satisfaction,  
complaints, goals, and suggestions of workers; provide continuous feedback on ­ incidents,  
ethical issues, problems; worker evaluations of management and systems; visitor evaluation  
of workers and services; stakeholder evaluations of workers and management.  
l Incident reports filed and evaluated; reduced number and severity of incidents involving  
workers; immediate attention given to workplace hazards and problems.  
l Support provided to workers.  
l Testing of training effectiveness.  
Three important forms of evaluation are considered in this section\: training effectiveness;  
worker performance; and worker well-being and satisfaction.  
Evaluating the effectiveneSS of training and other change-oriented proceSSes  
The Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick \(2007\) model has been widely used and modified, with  
­ Figure 9.2 being an adaptation to event management. The original model was hierarchical and  
focused on HR training effectiveness. However, it can be applied more widely to other evalu-  
ation problems. The base of the pyramid consists of the need to secure positive reactions to  
the experience \(in their case, to a training programme or module\). This is equivalent to asking  
guests how satisfied they are, or if they enjoyed the event. A higher level consists of finding out  
exactly what was learned \(assuming knowledge and/or skill development were the goal\) and  
if attitudes changed. It is clear this logic can be applied to theory-of-change models and social  
marketing efforts. The third level of evaluation focuses on how gained knowledge or skills  
have been applied to the job in the form of new behaviours. This will be difficult to measure in  
many cases, but in the case of an event, it could be determined through various forms of group  
discussion, supervisor feedback, and self-reporting by staff and volunteers. The pinnacle of the  
model is the most challenging, being the effectiveness of training \(or any other intervention\)  
on positive results for the organisation, such as return on investment \(ROI\). Event evaluators  
are more likely to consider the return on objectives or experience \(ROO, ROE\).  
Evaluating performance, satisfaction, and well-being  
Performance means different things in different settings. In the events world, it is often a  
­ matter of being adept in helping guests or customers to have the best possible experience,  
while in private companies it can mean maximising sales. That is why evaluating performance  
starts with mandate and goals, links with job descriptions and task analysis, and must support  
the overall culture and values of the organisation. Common techniques for evaluating staff and  
volunteers include teamwork and quality circles and 360-degree evaluations, plus a range of Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events 215

and Other Interventions Intended to Foster Change  
*Source\:* Adapted and expanded from Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick \(2007\)  
rating scales \(see Getz, 2018, 142–144\). Rating scales can be based on management by objectives  
\(e.g., performance does not meet objectives or expectations related to personal or organisa-  
tional goals\), comparative performance \(including within teams\), overall team ­ performance  
\(with or without internal team self-assessments\), competency tests, and behaviour ­ monitoring,  
including self-reporting.  
One might assume that if workers stay on their jobs, and if volunteers return, they are ­ satisfied.  
That is not necessarily so. With increasing attention to worker wellness and commitment,  
formal evaluation will be more necessary. Self-reporting should be encouraged, along with  
complaints and suggestions. Observation or surveys might work better if objective, third-party  
evaluators ask the questions. Managers will have to develop indicators of stress, potentially  
unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Proactive measures to foster health and wellness  
should be instigated, such as relaxation times and training, comfort zones, rewards and incen-  
tives, and access to mental and physical health experts.  
# Professionalisation, Professionalism, Education, and Careers  
Professionalism refers to the ways in which people perform their duties or operate their  
­ businesses and events, while professionalisation describes the process by which event manage-  
ment, for example, gets recognised as a legitimate profession. Both are closely associated with 216  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
university degrees, with most higher-education institutions claiming to prepare graduates for  
professional life and leadership positions, but it is not the determining factor. We expect both  
full-time, paid event professionals and unpaid volunteers to behave professionally, acting in  
accordance with a set of ethical standards, and being fully competent to do their jobs. We do  
not necessarily expect event management and related careers to be accepted as a profession  
on par with licensed doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Back in the early days, Getz and Wicks  
\(1994\) argued that event management can aspire to quasi-professional status on par with  
recreation and leisure managers, but the typical absence of government licensing prevented  
full professional status. However, the licensing of event professionals might come, at least in  
certain countries.  
Professionalism remains an important topic. Bladen and Kennell \(2014\) considered the neces-  
sary pedagogy, while Brown \(2014\) and Jiang and Schmader \(2014\) examined the case for pro-  
fessionalism from the perspective of practitioners. As professionalism increases, there will be  
a need for more focused research on what constitutes professionalism for events and ­ tourism,  
and on the related career issues for practitioners. Ethics is a first and major consideration.  
*Ethics \(Codes of Conduct\)*  
All professional associations, and most industry associations, have adopted codes of conduct or  
ethical standards which members are expected to meet. In traditional professions, such as med-  
icine or law, enforcement is strict and self-regulated by governing bodies. This is not the same  
as government-imposed standards for professional practice but is definitely linked. Several  
examples can be cited. The International Live Events Association \(formerly ISES\) has adopted  
the International Live Events Association \(ILEA\) Principles of Professional Conduct and Ethics.  
\(https\://ileahub.com/Meet-ILEA/Professional-Conduct-Ethics\)  
They require adherence to industry standards of ethics and performance, adherence to the law,  
protection of the public, truthful and accurate dealings through contracts, maintaining insur-  
ance, commitment to learning and growth, and fully cooperating with everyone to provide the  
highest level of service. Meeting Professionals International \(MPI\) has its principles of profes-  
sionalism \(https\://www.mpi.org/docs/\) which also stresses maintaining professional integrity,  
using professional business practices, and includes respecting diversity. International Festivals  
and Event Association \(IFEA\) \(https\://files.ifea.com/\) adds the obligation for members to  
improve the public’s understanding of the roles played by festivals and events in communities  
and society, maintaining the integrity and competence of professionals, and embracing the  
highest standards of human resource training and management.  
It is fair to say that there is no one set of rules, standards, or laws guiding the profession, and  
there might never be such unity. Those aspiring to professional careers related to events and  
tourism will have to decide which professional association to join \(or more than one\) and how  
they, personally should behave as professionals within those communities of practice.  
*Education and Careers in Event Management*  
There has always been a pedagogical debate on the best ways to prepare students for future  
careers, and it has been particularly relevant within event management. The trend towards  
experiential learning has been documented \(Sealy, 2018\), and no doubt this reflects three con-  
siderations\: the belief that people learn better by doing; student preferences \(especially if they  
can get paid as interns\), and feedback from employers as to what they expect from graduates. Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events In light of what Hagel \(2018\) and others have said about the future of work, there can be  
little doubt that the shift from lecturing and skills training to experiential learning \(such as  
designing, producing, and evaluating real events\) will help prepare future professionals for  
sustainable ‘creator’, ‘composer’ and ‘coach’ careers. However, this must not occur without equal  
attention given to theory, problem-solving, and management competency. Couto \(2023\) sum-  
marised the benefits of experiential learning in event management courses, saying hands-on  
projects allow students to follow the entire four-stage process described by Kolb \(1984\).  
It should be accompanied by feedback and tactics suited to different student learning styles.  
Industry involvement is ideal.

*Careers*  
Baum et al. \(2009\) were the first to cover research on HR issues in the events sector, while Jago  
and Mair \(2009\) discussed career theory applied to major events, referring to McCabe’s \(2008\)  
identification of a career pattern called ‘butterflying’. This term is applicable to convention and  
exhibition professionals, and they noted the difficulties associated with pulsating event organi-  
sations and one-time events. Many event professionals, out of preference and necessity, do not  
stay long in one job, and full-time traditional careers are in short supply. One consequence is  
the rotating of key staff between major events, and a career pattern that is described as episodic  
\(or butterflying\) – moving from one major event to another, in sequence. In this way, expertise  
from the Olympics, for example, gets transferred to the next one. Another trend is for private  
firms to provide staff to multiple events, or to produce many events professionally, for profit.  
Stone et al. \(2017\) explored the career preferences and expectations of event management  
students. Despite the fact that the careers they aspired to would not match those of other pro-  
fessionals in monetary terms, and the workloads could be heavier, students were still willing  
to choose a career in events. Also, see Barron and Ali-Knight \(2017\) on the career motivations  
and expectations of event and festival graduates.  
The changing nature of work and careers  
Even before the pandemic, many commentators were pointing out that the very nature of  
work is changing quickly, and not all jobs or careers will survive. Everyone is familiar with the  
so-called gig economy, and to a certain extent, it applies to the events sector where workers, both  
volunteers and professionals, flit from one event to the next - either out of necessity or to expe-  
rience new challenges and get ahead. According to the Education Design Lab \(www.eddesignlab.  
org\) several major forces are evident. The first is ‘job hopping’, meaning that life-long careers are  
a thing of the past and workers will have to be prepared to move frequently. Most good jobs 218  
Directing, Leadership , and Human Resources for Events  
will require university degrees, and even with a degree many existing job types will be replaced  
by machines and AI. There are two basic personal skills that will always be important\: adapt-  
ability \(i.e., agility, the capacity to change, such as working in new ways or for a new purpose,  
as required by one’s environment\) and creativity. Both of these capacities will be crucial for the  
event professionals of the future.  
Management guru Hagel noted in the August 21, 2018, Harvard Business Review \(online\),  
that the nature of work will likely undergo a profound transformation because of AI, elimi-  
nating many jobs. But there will be an enduring need for workers who exercise the human  
capabilities of curiosity, imagination, creativity, and emotional and social intelligence. Perti-  
nent to events, Hagel suggested three categories of professional career that should endure\:  
the ‘creators’ of innovative products and services, ‘coaches’ that help others learn and can give  
advice when needed, and ‘composers’ of unique experiences. What they all require is a passion  
for their work.  
Table 9.3 describes a number of career paths within event management, specifying related  
professional associations and their certifications. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list,  
nor does it claim a future perspective on how careers might evolve. Following Hagel \(2018\),  
students and teachers might want to project how the terms creator, composer, and coach might get  
translated into actual jobs and career paths in the age of AI \(e.g., Creators of live and virtual  
events within the metaverse? Composers of experiences within a world where people can be  
immersed in virtuality? Coaches on how to get the most out of event experiences?\).

STUDY GUIDE  
In this second chapter devoted to management, leadership has been highlighted. As most pro-  
fessionals will at some time assume, and will often aspire to leadership positions, it is import-  
ant to consider all the possible styles, tasks, and responsibilities associated with being a leader.  
Founders are in a unique position, raising the issue of succession and possible cultural con-  
flicts. Gaining access to event leaders will be important, either as formal mentors, on-the-job  
inspirations, or lecturers. If possible, document an event oganisation with regard to its gover-  
nance and decision-making, especially if a crisis was survived. This will reveal a great deal about 220

organisational strengths and resilience. Human resource management will become important  
for all managers, making it crucial to study theories and practical approaches to motivation,  
teamwork, performance evaluation, and wellness. As an exercise, consult an AI chat site as to  
future careers. Have fun.  
STUDY QUESTIONS

# Introduction  
Planning studies is considered first, introducing some basic planning theory. Planning is not  
merely a linear process of setting goals and determining how to achieve them, there are phil-  
osophical and ideological dimensions that should always be considered. It is important to  
distinguish between planning FOR events and planning WITHIN events. Who plans event

Event Planning and oPerations  
portfolios for cities and countries? Where does the funding come from? What are the roles of  
public-sector agencies in creating and marketing events? These issues were considered in the  
policy chapter. There are many planning functions within events to be discussed, from strategic  
through to logistics, with project planning being of great importance – especially to one-time  
events and events that go through pulsating planning processes.  
# Planning Theory  
Usually, planning is thought of contextually, so that one can specialise \(and find degree pro-  
grammes in\) urban and regional planning, environmental or social planning, business or finan-  
cial planning, etc. Planning Studies, however, focusses on the nature and scope of planning as  
a process, including theory on how planning follows from ideology, the purposes and impacts  
of planning, what factors should be considered in different planning applications, and phil-  
osophical questions such as who is involved or excluded \(i.e., the exercise of power\). Many  
definitions of planning can be found, but several fundamental aspects of planning can be stated  
with certainty.  
Planning is a future-oriented process. Normally this is reflected in how persons and organisations  
set goals and put in place actions to attain them. The process may be made explicit or can be  
inferred by reference to what people and organisations say and do. We all make plans, some-  
times grand and concrete, such as retirement planning through savings and investments, and  
sometimes minor and undocumented such as planning a dinner party.  
Planning cannot be static, it must adapt. While master plans or blueprints are often developed, either  
at strategic or operational levels \(e.g., the event’s strategic plan, site plan, and specifications for  
a sport or programme\) these must always be reviewed and refined through a continuous pro-  
cess of monitoring, evaluation, and feedback. In some cases, plans have to be modified during  
an event, reacting to problems or opportunities. A cyclical planning process makes more sense  
than a linear model, and this even applies to project planning because lessons from one project  
must be applied to subsequent projects. See Expert Opinion 4.1 on the related concept of agile  
management.  
Planning is always political in nature. Ideology sets in motion public-sector planning and organisa-  
tional culture guides how groups, managers, or programmes compete for influence or resources  
\(i.e., planning must consider internal and external stakeholders\). All policies and plans are  
constrained by resources, and there are usually \(some would say always\) competing claims on  
resources. If one strategy or programme is funded, others are ruled out.  
Planning is not a theoretical process undertaken in isolation, it is often focused on conflicts and prob-  
lems in society or within organisations. This is reflected in problem-solving, research, evalua-  
tion, and decision-making processes.  
The standard planning process is cyclical and comprises the following steps\:  
1 Setting a vision.  
2 Setting goals and objectives to be achieved.  
3 Formulating strategies to achieve goals and objectives.  
3 Creating the means to achieve strategies \(i.e., action planning\).  
4 Implementation, including controls and monitoring of all steps.  
5 Evaluation and feedback.  
6 Revisions\: rethinking the vision, setting new goals, etc. Event Planning and oPerations 223  
When planning is based on advocacy or desired change, the outcomes are ideologically based  
and therefore the planners’ vision is the best starting point.  
Vision\(ing\)\: Planning can occur on a purely technical level, such as planning for a sport event by  
reference to specifications set by sport federations, or planning for a new arena or festival park  
according to design standards. They are still future-oriented exercises and rational processes.  
Within strategic planning, as discussed later, visioning is a key component. We can look for-  
ward to an ideal state of affairs \(e.g., the perfect event\) or we can envision problems and try to  
avoid them \(e.g., we have to be better next year at managing crowd experiences\). This can lead  
to two distinct types of goals and strategies, but they can be combined. Underpinning a vision  
statement will be values, beliefs, attitudes, ideology, or a mix of these foundations. Planning  
must take them into account. If left unarticulated, later problems will emerge in the form of  
political conflict.  
*General Approaches to Planning*  
Muddling through and incrementalism are alternative approaches to managing organisations and  
events, although few professionals would admit to being muddlers, as it implies a lack of plan-  
ning, or flying by the seat of one’s pants. Instead, incrementalism is a preferred term. Incre-  
mentalism means gradualism, or taking small steps forward. In planning, it usually refers to a  
conscious decision to make progress slowly, in measured steps, especially when uncertainty or  
complexity is high. It does not attempt to be comprehensive but attacks problems and policy  
issues with precision instruments rather than broad strategies. It is also closely connected to  
the notion of a political market square in which decisions are made through bargaining and the  
exercise of power among all the stakeholders, rather than by professional planners or techno-  
crats. Collaborative or consensus-building processes are similarly intended to involve all parties and  
points of view but with an emphasis on formal issue identification and conflict resolution.  
It is arguable, however, whether rational planning or incrementalism is more democratic or  
effective. Other variables must be considered, especially the degree of inclusivity in who is  
consulted or otherwise involved in the planning process. Because there are usually competing  
interests in public-sector policy formation and planning, an open democracy will extend the  
invitation and provide the means for very wide input. Within an organisation, however, the  
owners or senior decision-makers might make all decisions and then inform staff \(or volun-  
teers\), thereby explicitly rejecting internal democracy \(this can also be thought of as the mili-  
tary or top-down approach\).  
Advocacy is another theoretical approach to planning, policy, and decision-making that can  
have relevance to the events sector. Advocacy is based on the premise that disadvantaged and  
marginalised groups in society are normally left out of planning and policymaking, and there-  
fore their interests must be represented by others. This idea gives rise to citizen involvement or  
­ community-based planning or participant evaluation.  
Needs-based planning responds to perceived and expressed needs in the community, or within the  
constituencies served by an organisation. Many events produced by not-for-profit organisations  
are explicitly serving identified needs, although there is always a question of who makes such  
a decision, and on what evidence. Governments at all levels are mandated to meet the needs  
of their citizens, giving rise to many policy fields that incorporate or generate planned events.  
Bottom-up planning is community-based, although the community can be defined in terms of  
groups rather than places. It should be inclusive, involving outreach to segments that otherwise  
might not have a voice. Collaboration is a hallmark of this approach. It will also involve needs  
assessments, advocacy, and the empowerment of communities to make their own decisions. 224  
Event Planning and oPerations  
As a consequence, it often runs up against bureaucracies and might be opposed on ideological  
grounds. In many places, this is done indirectly, and incompletely, through the actions of not-  
for-profit organisations who claim to meet public needs and fill gaps in government services.  
Two other major issues will arise in the bottom-up approach. Where do the resources come  
from to meet stakeholder demands? And, are all residents and groups equally consulted and  
served?  
Demand-based planning is categorically different. For-profit companies respond to existing or  
anticipated demand, that being what customers are willing to pay for. To policy planners, that  
presents the problem of market failure, because many people lack the financial means to obtain  
essential services or a desired level of services. Governments mostly provide services that are  
not provided by the private sector, although there can be parallel and even overlapping systems  
in place \(such as both private and public hospitals, both free and for-profit events\). Something for  
Everyone is a feature of community festivals, where the widest possible participation is desired,  
but it does not necessarily meet the needs of disadvantaged groups, and it could be open to  
bias. In a stakeholder-based or community development approach, facilities and services – and  
possibly events – would be planned according to democratic means, from the ground up.  
Targeting High-Value Segments\: This is a staple of event tourism strategies, especially within the  
context of a strategic, portfolio approach to bidding on and creating events for tourism and  
economic benefits. This leads to our later discussions of impact assessments and the difficulty  
of proving that events achieve certain benefits, or that benefits outweigh costs. The easiest  
case to prove is that of tourism attractiveness, as event tourists can generally be identified and  
their economic impacts estimated fairly accurately. Unfortunately, not all costs are considered  
in many impact studies.  
Maximising Participation\: One goal, borrowed from leisure, sports, and the arts that does make  
perfect sense for events planning, is that of achieving increases in public participation through  
the vehicle of providing and hosting events. If there are more participatory events that create  
leisure, sport, and artistic opportunities, then we should see increased participation leading  
to other benefits. Less certain is the often-made claim, called the demonstration effect or inspira-  
tion effect, that hosting spectator and mega-events will generate increased participation among  
spectators.  
Future Scenarios and Modelling\: An aspect of Futurism is scenario-making for one of two generic  
purposes\: \(a\) anticipate what is likely to happen and prepare for it \(avoid/prevent or try to  
make it happen\) and \(b\) model an ideal future state, leading to a vision and goals for plan-  
ning. For events, a future scenario in which live events decline, or event tourism disappears  
altogether, might be viewed by many as undesirable and therefore to be avoided. For event  
and other policy-field planners, modelling a future with an ideally balanced, diversified, and  
sustainable portfolio will provide direction. That is more or less the same as viewing events as  
agents of change.  
*Rational Versus Irrational Planning*  
Although planning by nature should be a rational process, it is clear that decisions in ­ government,  
business, and the events sector are often made in an irrational manner \(e.g., see ­ Armstrong,  
1985; Bramwell, 1997; Butler and Grigg, 1987\). Rational planning is generally defined as  
being future-oriented, involving a vision, the setting of goals, consideration of alternative  
courses of action and their potential consequences, the formulation and implementation of  
strategies and actions to realise goals, and continuous evaluation and feedback in order to Event Planning and oPerations 225  
improve the system. It is a cyclical process, continuously evolving and hopefully learning from  
past mistakes. To be rational means to behave logically, and logic is based on analysis, consider-  
ation of consequences, and a clearly reasoned course of action \(sometimes referred to as sound  
judgement\). However, we all behave irrationally at some times, being guided by instinct or  
emotions rather than reason or logic. Then there is the readily apparent problem that one per-  
son’s definition of logic or reason does not always conform to others. Finally, there is a school  
of thought that rational planning, as defined above, is neither possible, because of ideology and  
politics, nor desirable, because adherence to a master plan precludes flexibility and minimises  
longer-term adaptability.  
Bramwell \(1997\) concluded that for mega-events there was little evidence of a rigorous appli-  
cation of the full planning cycle as advocated in planning texts. Laybourn \(2004\) explored  
the theory of decision-making and applied it to the events sector. She found that the generic  
literature supports the contention that decision-makers are not naturally rational. They tend  
to use simplifying shortcuts called heuristics. In particular, potential negative impacts are com-  
monly underestimated, which has serious implications for risk assessment and management at  
events. When people stand to gain from a decision, they tend to be more cautious than when  
they stand to take a loss. Everyone notices when something goes wrong, whereas competency  
and success might be ignored.  
Current decisions are strongly influenced by previous decisions, especially when a lot of money  
has been invested, leading to entrapment. There is a natural tendency to want to recover sunk costs  
\(i.e., money already spent\) and maximise return on investments made. This can help explain  
why risky decisions are made, and the frequent pursuit of losing courses of action, despite obvi-  
ous and compelling arguments to the contrary. It helps explain an addiction to gambling.  
There are always costs of withdrawal to consider, but perhaps more important is the desire of  
decision-makers to not lose face. Laybourn also emphasised that decision-making is affected  
by personality, perceptions, emotions and moods, social factors, experience, the cost of infor-  
mation, time constraints, and gender. There are many constraints on perfect knowledge and  
perfect judgement, so people should be trained in effective decision-making.  
One has to ask, is bidding on and hosting a mega event a rational course of action? Who exactly  
wants it, and why? Who pays the price?  
# Planning For and Within Events  
A significant aspect of modern planned events is their elevation from the private, commu-  
nity, and institutional domains to formal incorporation into numerous public policy domains.  
Events of all kinds are being supported, created, and bid on, to meet diverse, strategic goals of  
society. Sharples et al. \(2014, vii\) in their book Strategic Event Creation stated\:  
Changes in the wider environment have triggered a new normal for event creation.  
Heightened attendee expectations, a keener focus upon the return required by funders  
and wider stakeholders, and, of course, an ever more competitive event marketplace.  
Couple these with CSR, social media, globalisation and technology and the reasons  
event creation is now a strategic and multilayered responsibility are clear.  
This has several important implications related to leadership, culture, and management.  
For example, those who plan and produce events are often dealing with a single client but are  
held accountable to a very wide group of stakeholders. This fact also applies to many events  
produced for corporations and nonprofit societies. 226  
Event Planning and oPerations  
While in many countries local and regional/state governments and their agencies have been at  
the forefront, national-level policies and strategies related to events cannot be ignored. Khodr  
\(2012\) scrutinised political reasons for Qatar’s event strategy, concluding that explanatory  
factors include economic sustainability and diversification, tourism, and social development  
strategies. These factors can be viewed in the light of globalisation and modernisation trends.  
Houlihan et al. \(2015\) identify reasons why countries host major sport events, including a  
desire for increased legitimacy and positive image; boosting sport participation and competi-  
tiveness; being a catalyst for urban economic regeneration; economic modernisation; allowing  
for diplomatic initiatives connected to international relations; nation and city identity-­ building  
and branding; and fostering social integration. Researchers have examined various policy  
domains that lead to the strategic creation, subsidising, or facilitation of planned events and  
their venues. Chapter 7 discussed policy options for governments and major policy domains  
that lead to the funding, development, and marketing of events. Strategic tourism roles have  
been well explored \(e.g., Stokes, 2008\). Swart \(2005\) argued for strategic planning of sport  
event tourism in South Africa. Presenza and Sheehan \(2013\) commented on the strategic value  
of a portfolio of sport events in destination development. Resources utilised by events are  
often aggressively sought by groups with many legitimate and appealing claims about their cul-  
tural, social, economic, or environmental benefits. Therefore, the allocation of public resources  
\(including subsidies\) to events generally requires organisers and producers to explicitly justify  
their public benefits.  
O’Toole’s Events Sector Maturity Model is relevant \(2011, 2021\). This evolutionary pro-  
cess is marked by increasing professionalism, but also more rules and regulations from the  
­ government – potentially stifling innovation. Standards are set for health, safety, and profes-  
sional conduct. In this light, the pandemic highlighted the fragility of mega-events and opened  
new opportunities for creativity and fostering agile event organisations.  
*Event Portfolio Planning*  
The expert opinion by Vassilios Ziakas provides a summary and reference list on this important  
topic. Note that portfolio planning is also covered in Chapter 15 in the context of event tour-  
ism, and that discussion covers the concepts of diversification, balance, and synergies. These  
topics relate very closely to legacy and leveraging.  
EXPERT OPINION 10.1\: By Dr. Vassilios Ziakas  
Vassilios Ziakas, PhD,* *is co-editor in chief of the book series *Events Management ­ Theory*  
*and Methods* by Goodfellow Publishers. His research cuts across sport and leisure ­ policy  
with emphasis on strategic planning, community development and sustainability.  
Event Portfolio Management in Focus  
The phenomenon of event portfolio is an under-researched topic in Event Studies.  
Despite several calls over the last two decades \(Chalip, 2004; Getz, 2005; Ziakas, 2019\)  
for the resonance of capitalising on portfolios rather than individual events, there is  
scant academic attention on understanding this complex phenomenon. The reasons  
are many and explained in detail in my latest book \(Ziakas, 2022\), but it seems that the Event Planning and oPerations 227  
most important aspects are the fragmentation of Event Studies \(e.g., in festivals/cul-  
tural, sport, and business events\) and the tradition of studying individual events. In fact,  
the very subject has been structured in a piecemeal fashion influenced by the parent  
disciplines \(tourism studies, sport management, cultural studies\), which gave shape to  
specialised subfields \(miCE, sport events, festivals\).  
A common denominator across all event subfields is the ‘singular’ focus on major  
events and their legacies, which obviously constrains comprehensive takes on an  
array of events, exploring their interrelationships and potential synergies. In contrast,  
practitioners have been more open-minded as we can see many city-wide event pro-  
grammes or regional portfolios across the world such as Auckland, Edinburgh, Gold  
Coast, Sunshine Coast, Gothenburg, Manchester, Wales \(Antchak et al., 2019\) that seek  
out to make up ‘eventful’ cities \(Richards and Palmer, 2010\). The integrative staging of  
periodic and/or one-off events synergised together as a system in a host community’s  
annual calendar creates a permanent structure – the event portfolio – with the ability to  
bestow benefits from one event to another, thereby engendering constant benefits that  
their whole is higher than the sum of individual events’ benefits. This way a portfolio  
becomes an ongoing and highly versatile policy tool that makes the pursuit of individual  
events and legacy pointless.  
To better understand event portfolios, it is important to distinguish between organic  
and strategically formalised portfolios. Organic ones existed long before the concep-  
tualisation and academic study of event portfolios started, and they comprise annual  
calendar programmes that concentrate an array of events more or less coherently. They  
provided contexts for early studies such as Fort Stockton \(Ziakas, 2010\), Gainesville  
\(Gibson et al., 2012\), Termoli \(Presenza and Sheehan, 2013\), Barcelona \(Richards, 2015\),  
London-Ontario \(Clark and Misener, 2015\), Portimão \(Pereira et al., 2015\), Auckland  
\(Antchak, 2017\), Berlin \(Viol et al., 2018\), Madeira \(Almeida et al., 2019\), Cook Islands  
\(Dickson et al., 2018\), and De Moines \(Singh and Olson, 2021\). Strategic formalised  
portfolios constitute deliberate structures that derive from the evolution and matu-  
ration of organic portfolios like the cases of Edinburgh, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast,  
Manchester, and Gothenburg. Recently, Liang et al. \(2021\) describe how Shanghai’s  
sporting event portfolio has evolved into a formalised one. Likewise, Sobral et al. \(2022\)  
explore the utility of including regular sport team events \(those played by professional  
sport teams in a sport league\) in the development of a portfolio strategy in an Aus-  
tralian region. These studies demonstrate that the move from organic forms to more  
formalised portfolio structures is a complex process imbued with constraints that takes  
time to be completed. Also, the study of event portfolios is highly complex and will take  
time to be fully developed.  
There is clearly a great deal of learning to be done regarding event portfolios and  
their management in the future. This warrants \(and requires\) the development of a  
transdisciplinary field on portfolio management converging festival, tourism, sport, and  
other allied disciplines to the study of events. Portfolio management for events entails a  
new logic and mindset looking for synthesis and synergy moving past long-established  
fragmentation and divisions. We are just in the beginning. Along with emerging stud-  
ies, there are now three books \(Antchak et al., 2019; Ziakas, 2014; Ziakas et al., 2021\)  
that set up firm foundations for developing knowledge on event portfolios and their  
management. 228

Balanced Portfolios\: Researchers Bodin and Taks \(2022\) concluded that multisectoral event  
­ portfolios are needed to meet community engagement goals and benefits for residents.  
A number of authors have noted that resident interests and perceptions of impacts do not  
always coincide with those of event proponents and providers, making a narrow emphasis on  
sport events and bidding on mega-events controversial or counterproductive. Balance, in this  
sense, refers both to satisfying multiple interests and to the alliance between objectives and  
outcomes.  
In Table 10.1, we compare planning for the event organisation, which we assume to be perma-  
nent, and for the event itself. Sometimes they are the same thing. We have added a column that  
indicates typical planning-related documents.  
*Goals, Objectives, Indicators, and Methods*  
Goals\: Plans can either follow a general strategy, which can retain as much flexibility as possi-  
ble, or follow set goals that can be achieved. Goals are expressed in general terms, such as “to  
maximise profit” or “reduce carbon emissions”. They should be achievable with effort, and in  
the spirit of continuous improvement constantly revised to encourage higher levels of achieve-  
ment, productivity, or sustainability.  
SMART objectives are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, And Time-bound. Some goals do  
not lend themselves to this level of objective-setting, but where possible the setting of SMART  
objectives facilitates evaluation and impact assessment. Time-bound means a schedule or com-  
pletion date is set in advance. For events, post-event evaluation and impact assessment generally  
require SMART objectives. The question then becomes, what measures should we use?  
Metrics\: Any number of metrics can be used to measure effectiveness \(such as goal attainment\)  
and efficiency. Many objectives lend themselves to quantitative metrics, including monetary  
and numerical, while others cannot be measured directly and require surrogate measures.  
Surrogates\: Anything intangible, such as well-being or social capital, can still be evaluated and  
impacts assessed through the establishment of surrogate measures. These are mutually agreed-  
upon indicators of the phenomenon or quality. For example, one usual indicator of many intan-  
gibles is satisfaction. It is assumed that if people are satisfied, say with their experience or their  
job, then programmes and services are working as intended, or of high quality. That kind of  
assumption has to be verified through evaluation.  
Key performance indicators \(KPIs\)\: measures deemed to be most important as indicators of how  
well workers are performing, or how well services and programmes are being delivered.  
Key impact indicators \(KIIs\)\: measures deemed to be most important in evaluating the effective-  
ness of goal attainment, and the effects of development, services, and programmes. 230

Event Planning and oPerations  
Methods\: Having set goals and objectives, then determined the measures or indicators to be  
used in evaluation and IA, and the remaining task is to determine what methods are necessary  
and appropriate to obtain the data. This entails consideration of proof and evidence. These topics  
are all covered in the chapter on evaluation and impact assessment.  
# Project Planning and Management  
Project planning and management functions encompass vital skill sets for all events – even  
those produced by permanent organisations that also do strategic planning. The basic nature of  
events is that they are defined by time \(a limited duration\) and their schedule is announced and  
usually fixed well in advance. This necessitates getting all the planning and preparations done  
according to an often tight schedule. According to O’Toole \(2021\), many event projects fail or  
overrun their budget and schedule, and often this is due to poor planning or control systems.  
*Feasibility Studies*  
Feasibility studies should ideally precede, or at least accompany, project planning. In a rational  
planning process, we do not commit to an event until we know it is affordable, desirable, envi-  
ronmentally sound, marketable, and manageable. All too often, however, events are bid on and  
planned without full feasibility studies or cost-and-benefit forecasts. Far too little attention is  
given to feasibility within the context of portfolios and populations of events. While a single  
event can be assessed as to costs and impacts, its effects on other events are harder to eval-  
uate. Long-term feasibility and sustainability of all events present quite different issues from  
single-event feasibility. Mega-event feasibility is a distinct application given the long-term plan-  
ning, high production costs, capital investments in infrastructure, and potential for negative  
and unexpected impacts. Uncertainty increases as a consequence, making accurate forecasts of  
demand, costs, and external influences extremely difficult. The pandemic demonstrated how  
unpredictable events and worst-case occurrences can disrupt the best-laid plans.  
Questions to address in event feasibility studies\:  
–  
–  
–  
Is it technically feasible? \(e.g., the desired experiences can be facilitated; approvals can be  
secured and regulations met; specifications can be met, such as for sport events\); venues or  
spaces are suitable and available\).  
Is it affordable? \(e.g., funds will be committed; demand and sales have been forecast to be  
adequate; costs are known and can be controlled; potential debt will be underwritten\).  
Is it desirable? \(e.g., community and political support is assured; opportunity costs have  
been examined and the event is judged to be worthwhile; it fits the community and its event  
portfolio\).  
O’Toole \(2011\) explained the specific tools employed in project planning, including project  
scoping, work breakdown, and task analysis, costing, risk analysis, and scheduling and con-  
trolling with critical paths. Management of time is critical, and often time pressures lead to  
modifications or political actions to get the job done. A full life-cycle approach is recommended,  
including how to wind up the event and deal with the legacy.  
Knowledge Areas  
As detailed by Salama \(2021\) in the book Event Project Management, the knowledge areas  
for project planning and management are to be aligned with the overall event management Event Planning and oPerations 233  
strategy, especially relating to stakeholders and sustainability. They overlap with MBECS and  
EMBOK for the simple reason that so many events are one-time only \(i.e., they are projects\)  
and many others, although periodic, go through annual cycles that require gearing up quickly  
and terminating efficiently, much like projects. All events and projects are time-limited, mak-  
ing scheduling and related resource allocations critical. It is also wise to consider how project  
planning and management principles and methods can be applied to even the best-established  
events, especially when it comes to scheduling and prevention of budget and scope creep. These  
creeps often occur because of extenuating circumstances \(i.e., they cannot be controlled, like the  
weather\) but also arise from inattention to details or political interference.  
Salama’s \(2018\) model of sustainable project management is also highly relevant. The main  
dimensions are sustainability, adaptive leadership, life-cycle assessment, adopting advanced  
technology, managing innovation, assurances and control, and maturity. Some elaboration is  
necessary for each of these.  
Sustainability\: Events and other projects, especially those of large scale, have cumulative and  
long-term impacts. Goals have to be set for each event project that reflect and implement soci-  
etal goals for the environment, economy, culture, and community. Major events, particularly  
those that are bid on competitively, are usually subjected to feasibility studies and detailed  
cost-benefit evaluation, but all planned events should be evaluated in these ways within a  
­ sector-wide or portfolio structure.  
Adaptive Leadership\: Leaders of projects require cultural and emotional skills to balance technical  
skills, in order to deal effectively and fairly with the workforce – a challenge that is heightened  
in the event sector where dependency on volunteers is common, and professionals often move  
from one event project to another, or work on multiple events. Corporate social responsibility in  
this context means that all members of the team, all leaders and workers, adhere to sustainabil-  
ity principles. In this context, viewing events as agents of change is a complementary principle.  
Life-Cycle Assessment\: Salama \(2021, 13\) advocated “benefit realization management” to ensure that  
event managers work with stakeholders in the setting and achievement of goals, with goals  
being defined as benefits. This approach must cover all phases, from concept development to  
either decommissioning \(i.e., complete wind up\) or mothballing \(i.e., many events hold over  
key staff, equipment, venues, and especially knowledge until the next cycle begins\). During  
all phases, there must be evaluation criteria \(i.e., key performance and impact indicators\) to  
ensure compliance with the budget and schedule, as well as effectiveness in goal attainment.  
Adopting Advanced Technologies\: Advances in technology continue to influence event planning and  
management. These include information communications \(ICT\), big data analysis, machine  
learning \(or AI\), the IoT, block-change technology for supply chain management, and real-time  
monitoring and analysis. Events can analyse customer movements, behaviour, and feedback in  
real time, making risk assessment and crowd management much more efficient, and improving  
programming for enhanced experiences.  
Managing Innovation\: The key innovation challenges and concepts are discussed in various parts  
of this book. Eco-innovation refers to both the greening of events and the assessment of their  
contribution to climate change, leading to progress in achieving carbon neutrality or reduction,  
and encouraging positive changes in attitudes and practices within society. Elsewhere, the sec-  
tion on sustainable event cities is highly relevant \(see Table 13.2\). Stemming from the global  
pandemic, the entire event sector, in concert with numerous stakeholders, must re-think finan-  
cial resilience. That challenge will often require so-called lean start-ups and events, being those  
with tight budgets and well-crafted programmes to attain desired benefits. 234  
Event Planning and oPerations  
Fostering agile management and leadership is a closely related challenge, as events cannot expect  
to forever operate in stable environments. This means more than being flexible, it requires a  
mindset by leaders, stakeholders, and even customers that expects and accepts change – as  
long as it furthers goal attainment and enhances or maintains event experience quality. Agile  
management was a necessity when the pandemic hit, as explained in Expert Opinion 4.1 and  
Profiles 1.1 and 5.1.  
Assurance and Control\: Essential controls are sometimes neglected in event planning and opera-  
tions, resulting in cost overruns and inadequate revenue generation, or failures in service deliv-  
ery and safety. One major result of the pandemic was the realisation that health regulations and  
precautions are absolute necessities that will not go away, along with risk management related  
to safety and security systems.  
Maturity\: Salama \(2021, 14\) put it this way\: “Maturity refers to an efficient and effective system that  
fosters continuous improvement through agility, lean effective knowledge management and sustainable inno-  
vation”. Repeated disasters, terrorist and criminal attacks, and the recent pandemic all have  
influenced event producers and stakeholders, leading to adoption of the planning and manage-  
ment principles and systems described above.  
*Phases of an Event Project*  
A typical project has four or five distinct phases, depending on how one combines the ­ necessary  
actions. A one-time event is definitely planned in a linear fashion, while periodic events require  
cyclical planning. However, within a portfolio each one-time event must support and inform  
the entire portfolio, requiring careful evaluation of outcomes and lessons learned. In Table 10.2,  
four broad phases are presented, with elaboration on event-specific ­ considerations \(both  
­ one-time and periodic\). A section covering the project toolkit follows, but details are to be  
found in the books cited above.  
1 Initiation  
Events have a purpose and goals, even if they are implicit. Private companies do not need  
to specify they are attempting to make a profit, and government agencies are assumed to be  
acting in the public’s interest. But this does not obviate needs assessments or demand and  
marketing research, feasibility studies, development of a business plan with a sound budget,  
statements of the benefits to be achieved, or how success will be measured.  
2 Commitment  
In project terminology, a project charter is agreed to by the key stakeholders, and in the events  
world that generally means wide consultations. When events are conceived as agents of  
change, full stakeholder input is a necessity, whereas the primary stakeholders for a ­ private  
company are likely to be more tightly defined. Adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility  
principles by private companies is recommended, and this will encourage wider input.  
Salama \(2021, 40\) provided a template for a project charter, consisting of statements on the  
need, event description, anticipated benefits, timeframe, estimated total cost, relationship  
to other projects, and critical issues. This is a kind of business plan, and its formulation  
and composition will be dictated by governance. That is, differences will occur between the  
private, public, and not-for-profit sectors. The charter might also resemble a strategic plan,  
or a resolution adopted by a City Council, but the key point is that an appropriate authority  
sanctions the event project. This can follow a top-down process \(e.g., the Council wants  
its staff to produce a festival\) or bottom-up \(e.g., a community group wants money for a  
celebration\). Event Planning and oPerations 235

Scoping means determining the desired outcomes and the work required to complete the  
project. Scoping will include a timeline and costings, incorporating some degree of flexi-  
bility. Scope Creep is the process of expanding work and/or expenses within a project. It can  
happen in the absence of tight monitoring and controls, because of political pressure, or  
other external influences including unpredictable forces like the pandemic.  
3 Detailed planning\: At some point, the planning and design teams, plus any construction  
managers, must give way to the managers producing the event. The transition can be  
important, which often means the event’s senior managers participate in all the feasibility  
and planning. For smaller events, those people actually do it all. The detailed plan covers  
venues, programmes, schedules, and tasks. Costing has to be completed, then a budget is  
formulated. 236  
Event Planning and oPerations  
4 Implementation\: The event is the project we are interested in, but venue constructions are  
done in advance, which is often the case for mega-events, and are also projects that have to  
be planned and managed.  
5 Wrap-up\: No project is complete without pre-planning its termination and the wrapping  
up of human resources, final accounting, site clean-up or transition to a planned after-  
use, knowledge transfer, and other tasks to ensure all goals and commitments have been  
attained. A small event using a built venue generally has little to worry about, whereas  
mega-events with planned, long-term legacies will require a long wrap-up period with a  
number of professions involved and perhaps the establishment of a permanent organisation.  
The project planning and management toolkit  
Table 10.3 draws from several sources\: \(https\://www.projex.com/pmp-pmbok-common-­ tools-  
techniques/\); Salama \(2021\); O’Toole \(2021\), to examine the specific tools employed in project  
planning, including project scoping, benefits/goal specification, setting parameters, feasibility,  
work breakdown, and task analysis, costing, risk analysis, and scheduling, and controlling with  
critical paths.  
Scheduling, and possible responses to running out of time\: The basic nature of events is that they are  
defined by time, and their dates are usually fixed well in advance. This necessitates getting all  
the planning and preparations done according to an often tight schedule. Management of time  
is critical, and often time pressures lead to modifications, or political interference to get the job  
done. If it becomes clear that the event cannot be produced on time or on budget, according to  
the initial specifications, a number of actions can be taken\:  
l Re-scheduling \(seldom popular; the larger the event, the more costly this becomes\).  
l Cancellation \(with no intended re-scheduling; will suppliers and performers have to be  
refunded or compensated? Customers reimbursed?\).  
l Programme reduction \(eliminate costly, difficult elements; quality reductions\). These will  
lead to expectation-disconfirmation issues, depending on pre-marketing.  
l Capital spending reductions \(which can have a ripple effect on programming and the overall  
experience\).  
These strategies can have an impact on demand, and on the ability of the event to generate  
revenue, necessitating a parallel budget review. Quality reductions are probably the easiest  
to implement, such as reducing the number of hours of operation or providing fewer on-site  
services, with a resulting reduction in paid staff or rentals. Managers will have to evaluate the  
impact on customer experience and satisfaction.  
# Logic and Theory-of-Change Models  
Weiss \(1972\) is generally credited with the creation of these models. Advice on the ­ construction  
and use of logic and theory-of-change models is provided by Getz \(2018, 2019a\). The ­ models  
require the identification of intended or desired outputs and outcomes, with logic models  
being more short-term in their orientation and generally appropriate for routine or technical  
evaluation. TOC models are designed when events or event portfolios are conceived as agents  
of change. Within an existing event organisation, the TOC model can be used for specific  
programmes or possible modifications of the event’s mandate or location – anything requiring Event Planning and oPerations 237

to be patient and make progress in small steps. This will work better for portfolios, wherein  
individual events are expected to make different contributions. 238

Figure 10.1 Theory-of-Change Process  
*Source\:* Adapted from Weiss \(1972\)  
Figure 10.1 outlines a theory-of-change process. The starting point is to agree upon the  
­ outcomes desired, then set goals and KIIs. There is another side to using TOC models, the  
idea being that stakeholder collaboration in itself is a major goal. If the intent is to foster social  
integration and create social capital, what better way than to bring key groups together to plan  
an event or event portfolio strategy, complete with evaluation indicators and methods?  
Causal pathways\: These are the actions required to achieve outputs and outcomes, with the expec-  
tation that doing A will lead to B and ultimately will produce desired result C. This is probably  
the most difficult part of the process because, for events, applicable causal ­ theory is minimal.  
We know that producing and/or marketing events as tourist attractions will potentially gener-  
ate economic benefits, but there is no way to predict with certainty that an event or portfolio  
of events will both attract tourists and change the local economy for the ­ better. ­ Experience is a  
great teacher, but it does not constitute a theory. If the planners, working together, cannot come  
up with a relevant and trusted theory, then uncertainty has to be accepted, and risks assessed.  
What this means is that in most circumstances the TOC model, whenever events are conceived  
as agents of change, the entire TOC process becomes an experiment that can help build theory.  
These models are used infrequently, but one example is from Festivals Edinburgh \(BOP  
­ Consulting, 2018\) which developed twin logic models for examining the wider impacts of  
­ Edinburgh’s festivals on Scotland. These employed an ‘inputs-activities-outputs-­ outcomes-impact’  
path, with the inputs consisting of funding from all sources, resources from partners,  
­ stakeholders, and staff, and creativity from Scottish and International talent. The measurable  
outputs for ­ Edinburgh festivals were defined in quantitative terms\: events produced; audiences  
reached; jobs created in the wider economy; Scottish performers, artists, and speakers receiving  
profiles and platforms; and networking activities. Outcomes \(which we equate with impacts\)  
were defined as follows\: Edinburgh recognised globally as the world’s leading festival city;  
Scotland’s creative talent gains profile and opportunity; the festivals facilitate and support  
sectorial development, and formal and informal education and training opportunities. Finally, Event Planning and oPerations 239  
impacts included increased confidence and pride, enrichment of the cultural ecosystem, and  
gains for Scottish artists and companies. Related to the terminology used, starting with the  
open-systems model, outcomes and impacts can be the same long-term results or systemic  
changes.  
*Events for Development; Advocacy*  
There are now many proponents for utilising events as agents of change, or as some phrase it,  
for development. This approach links to event leveraging and legacy, advocacy through events,  
and social movements. Schulenkorf et al. \(2022\) gave the example of Street Soccer USA which  
has the mission of using sport to help people in poverty. The goal is to foster positive life  
changes. Those authors elaborated upon appropriate conceptual foundations, including sport-  
for development, \(Lyras and Welty Peachey, 2011\), Intergroup Contact Theory \(Allport, 1954\),  
and social capital \(Putnam, 1995, 2000\). The basic idea in sport development is to incorporate  
­ community-wide participation into major sport events with the aim of encouraging partic-  
ipation and knowledge transfer. Allport’s idea was to reduce inter-group bias \(e.g., during  
collaborations\) by meeting four key conditions, including assurances of equal status, common  
goals, inter-group cooperation, and support of authorities, law, or custom. Pertaining to events  
and other projects, refer to the Political Market Square and Social Capital for elaboration. The  
discussion of leveraging and legacy is pertinent.  
# Strategic and Business Planning  
Although there is no real evidence to support the claim that strategic planning results in better  
events or more sustainable organisations, it seems inconceivable that event producers would  
not want to have a vision, set goals and make strategies for the long term. One-time events also  
need goals and a plan, and if the planning period is measured in years, it will have strategic ele-  
ments built in. What separates strategic planning from project planning, in theory, is first of all  
the principle of adaptability. An event project usually has a fixed goal, an event with a specified  
form and function, its timing, and programme as givens. But periodic events and their organ-  
isations have to adapt to changes in their environment – their goals are changeable, and the  
events evolve. Being a learning organisation improves adaptability. Strong external stakeholder  
relationships help to ensure permanence and necessary inputs. The mandate or mission of the  
organisation needs to be periodically reviewed, then the vision, leading to a re-assessment of  
goals and strategies.  
Strategy is the second main difference, in the sense that a project has a single outcome \(the  
event\) whereas strategy to implement goals or fulfil a mandate can evolve and be multidimen-  
sional. A strategy is defined as an integrated set of policies, programmes, and actions intended to  
fulfil the organisation’s mandate, realise its vision and achieve its goals. In contrast to rationally  
planned strategies, emergent strategy happens as a consequence of the many decisions taken or  
untaken and is often only perceived in hindsight. For example, a manager might say “It was not  
until years later that I could identify our strategy-in-practice as one of accommodating and inte-  
grating key stakeholders, bringing them in as partners. It just seemed the right way to develop”.  
Research is fundamental to the process of strategic planning, including environmental and future  
scanning \(i.e., of forces and trends\), situation analysis \(i.e., where we are, our current situation\),  
stakeholder input and issues identification, and market and consumer research \(including  
strengths, weaknesses opportunities, and threats relative to competitors\). Specific outputs in  
the process typically include a vision statement, goals, strategies, action, or implementation plan  
\(actions, costs, schedule, and responsibilities defined\), and a marketing/communications plan. 240  
Event Planning and oPerations  
*The Business Plan*  
How to prepare and use a business plan for events was outlined in Getz \(2005\), while  
­ Tassiopoulos \(2011\) explored detailed business planning for new ventures. Unfortunately, the  
business plan is often overlooked or produced only for show. It is a convenient and useful way  
to summarise the event concept, its feasibility in financial and marketing terms, and its man-  
agement. At the core of every business plan is a believable budget with costs fully estimated  
and revenues realistically forecast. It is the budget, or financial feasibility, that sinks many  
events. Cash-flow projections are also vital components in business plans. Many events have to  
spend up-front, but earn most of their revenue only at the time of the event through sales – or  
even afterwards, when grants come in.  
# Site Planning, Operations, and Logistics  
Site planning is much more than preparing a map or floor plan, as the designer is attempting to  
create an ideal environment to facilitate desired experiences. Basic elements of a site plan \(or  
floor plan, in the case of indoor assembly spaces\) include the following\:  
l A map showing setting affordances and restrictions, such as what can and cannot be done as  
activity or decor; this will include scale, structures, underground and above-ground services;  
topography; vegetation; drainage; adjacent land uses and buildings; orientation to the sun,  
wind, and other environmental influences.  
l Capacity \(often legally prescribed by fire marshals, but otherwise determined by consider-  
ations of safety, comfort, and security\).  
l Flow\: access and egress points; circulation; legibility; and presentation of sales and other  
displays.  
l Decor.  
l Sensory mapping \(both what is desired for effects and what the guest is likely to perceive\).  
l Arrangements of furniture, displays, booths, etc., considering viewing, comfort, flow, and  
capacity.  
l Security \(fencing; ticketing; observation points; and police presence\).  
l Information, including signage and more subtle cues.  
l Comfort and health \(water; toilets; first aid; and evacuation routes\).  
*Operations*  
Operations refers to all those systems that must be in place, and the actions that have to be  
taken, to produce the event. Clearly, these have to be planned well in advance, unless you are  
doing a flash mob. Operations can also be thought of as the day-to-day decisions and actions  
within the event organisation or company, as opposed to strategic and business-level actions.  
Operations and logistics generally apply to three subsystems, namely\:  
1 Customer-oriented \(traffic, queuing, ticketing, information, essential services, comfort, and  
safety, crowd management\), see Plate 10.1.  
2 Supplier-oriented \(utilities, infrastructure, technical services, and security systems\).  
3 Communications \(equipment, procedures, accreditation, hosting the media, and scheduling\).  
Tum et al. \(2006\) provided a more comprehensive event operations model. Its main compo-  
nents are the analysis stage \(environmental scanning and situational analysis\), the operations Event Planning and oPerations 241  
Plate 10.1* *Gravel Royale Campsite

planning process – both strategic and detailed – implementation and delivery, and performance  
evaluation. The basic theory and methods come from operations management and from proj-  
ect planning and management. Tum et al. use the concept of transforming processes \(as in our  
open-systems management model\) to describe operations. Resources and other inputs are con-  
verted into the desired outputs, namely, the event or other services and products. Operations  
in this context are influenced by four major event characteristics\:  
1 Size and volume of output \(how many guests, how many transactions?\).  
2 Complexity and variety of services/products offered to the consumer \(size of the site, com-  
plexity of the programme\).  
3 Uncertainty \(of attendance, costs, time, and technical requirements\).  
4 Interactions \(extent and nature of contact between guests and staff\).  
Logistics is about how to move people, goods and equipment, even money and tickets, to the  
right place at the right time. The event producer could take the approach of trying to schedule  
it all to perfection, as in just-in-time delivery, or simply get everything and everyone together at  
one place at one time and then try to sort it out. This latter approach could prove chaotic.  
People movement\: There has to be a plan for traffic and parking, including policing and security.  
Site planning takes into account accessibility, flow, and emergency evacuation. Queuing and  
service provision efficiency are related issues. Some event production companies also engage  
in destination management, which in terms of logistics involves greeting and transporting arriving  
guests/participants, getting them from place to place, and even providing tours and enter-  
tainment. Registration and ticketing are key elements. As these often cause bottlenecks, it’s 242  
Event Planning and oPerations  
best to do them in advance, electronically. Security can be a major consideration, especially if  
­ everybody has to be searched, and preventing a crowd rush to the stage is always necessary.  
Queuing theory\: For many events, especially meetings and sport competitions, everyone arrives  
and leaves at roughly the same time, often resulting in traffic congestion and long line-ups. To  
the extent that arrivals and departures can be staggered, congestion can be reduced. Batch arriv-  
als and departures can be utilised to ease the problem, such as by assembling guests at various  
external points and then bringing them to the venue in groups. Reservation systems, specifying  
times and places for guests, are an alternative solution.  
How to manage people in queues or line-ups is another management challenge. Theme parks  
have become skilled at both the psychological and physical management of queues, including  
offering people the option of paying extra to avoid them! One needs to consider the rate of  
arrivals and average service time \(i.e., how fast are people arriving, and how long does it take to  
get them through the gates?\). The resultant measure of customer intensity shows the probability  
of queuing and queue lengthening.  
Procurement and supply chain management\: Many goods and services \(including information\) have  
to be purchased or subcontracted, which is procurement. The supply chain refers to how needed  
information, goods, and services flow to and through the event system, corresponding to the  
inputs, transforming processes and outputs in the open-systems model. For events, a failure in  
the supply chain could mean cancellation, programme reduction, or quality problems.  
Supply chains should be managed to achieve a number of objectives\:  
l Maximise efficiency \(no waste or time delays; getting only what was ordered\).  
l Ensure quality \(through setting standards and inspections\).  
l Minimise costs \(e.g., through competitive bidding\).  
l Bring suppliers into the event as sponsors or partners.  
l Ensure security \(theft protection\) and safety.  
l Benefit the host community \(source locally\).  
l Ensure a green event, by requiring all suppliers to conform to environmental management  
standards.  
A key decision for any organisation is that of outsourcing versus internal supply. It might look  
attractive to avoid external supply costs by doing it yourself, but that strategy entails many  
potential investment costs and subsequent efficiency risks. Tum et al. \(2006, 123\) provided an  
illustration of the ‘chain of decisions and decision points’ associated with supply chain management.  
Clearly, the process requires a technical knowledge of the event’s needs, as well as how to work  
with suppliers.  
# Why Events Succeed or Fail  
The book Events Mismanagement\: Learning From Failure \(Brown, Higson, and Gaston, 2022\) exam-  
ined failure from multiple perspectives. One can argue that if the causes and symptoms of  
failure are known, then success strategies can be followed, but that is not necessarily true. The  
fact is, no one formula will guarantee success, and no one reason will necessarily lead to failure.  
But it is important to learn from examples of both.  
Success is largely a matter of achieving one’s goals, whatever they might be. However, if an  
organisation does not endure, if it lurches from crisis to crisis, if it does not adhere to principles Event Planning and oPerations 243  
of responsibility and sustainability, or if it frequently requires subsidies, one can question its  
success. In other words, it all depends.  
Failure, on the other hand, is usually associated with insolvency, bankruptcy, and termination.  
It can also be suggested that events that experience serious failures, such as major accidents or  
delivery of poor service quality, have failed – at least in part. Again, one’s perspective on suc-  
cess and failure matters in the definitions. Research on this subject has been minimal, leading  
to the need for the above-mentioned, edited book.  
Getz \(2002\) identified financial problems as the leading cause of festival failure, with others  
identified by respondents being the weather and organisational culture. Higson \(2022\) used a  
three-part structure to examine causes of event failure, distinguishing between those that are  
preventable \(e.g., they arise from weak systems or incompetence\), those that are intelligent  
\(i.e., part of an experiment\), and those arising from complex situations where one cannot  
be expected to understand or control all the various causes. Higson recommended fault-tree  
analysis to determine causes and discussed barriers to learning from failure. He noted that  
lessons must be learned at the levels of individuals, teams, and organisations. Elsewhere in  
the book Events Mismanagement contributors examined the following\: stakeholder mismanage-  
ment; issues discussed under the headings of safety, security, health, ticketing, and legal; mis-marketing;  
waste management; and risk management.  
The British Council has identified factors common to unsuccessful projects, and these can be  
applied to events in general, or one-time events\:

Poor definition of the project brief.  
Specifications poorly researched or defined.  
Lack of appropriate skills and experience.  
Users not placed at the heart of project focus and decision-making.  
Insufficient engagement by senior management.  
Lack of positive communication and engagement with stakeholders.  
Unrealistic timescales.  
Unrealistic budget.  
Poor risk identification and management.  
Lack of change management control.  
Success strategies are more difficult to determine. Benchmarking against the most successful  
events in a given category is a starting point, as long as the underpinning strengths are identi-  
fied. Strong corporate sponsorship and committed public funding might appear to be an event’s  
principal success factors, as these are indicators of becoming an institution. Environmental  
forces can be more important than culture, strategy, or management systems in predicting  
success or failure. When the pandemic hit in 2020, weaknesses were revealed in many organi-  
sations, leading to the question\: was the pandemic the real cause of failure?  
STUDY GUIDE  
Many event management academic programmes require students to plan and deliver a real  
event, then evaluate the outcomes. This is experiential learning and should incorporate the  
principles and methods reviewed in this chapter. Using the project planning model is a starting 244  
Event Planning and oPerations  
point, and in the context of an academic exercise scheduling will immediately become a big issue  
\(i.e., “That’s all the time we have?”\). If possible, use the logic model, and for more elaborate and  
long-term projects the theory-of-change process, to plan a bigger event. Give careful thought to  
your goals\: are they short-term outputs, such as the immediate result of raising money, or sys-  
temic change, such as contributing to community development? If a site plan is needed, consult  
the design principles in Chapter 11, and find online site planning software to assemble a decent  
map or floor plan. Again, if time permits, do a business plan with full budget and include success  
factors or indicators of success. Evaluate and report on reasons for success or failure.  
STUDY QUESTIONS

# Introduction  
Planning and design are interrelated to the point where many people use the terms inter-  
changeably when applied to events. It can be confusing, but as explained in the first section  
of this chapter, design embodies art, creativity, and technical processes to solve problems. It  
should be integrated with all planning processes, starting with strategic thinking about mis-  
sion, goals, and sustainability. Designers will definitely be called upon to create the right set-  
tings, programme, and services to facilitate desired experiences, even though experiences are  
highly personal. In the first part of this chapter theory and principles are discussed, focusing on  
experience design, followed by application to settings, programme, and services.  
# What Is Design?  
Design is both a technical and creative act. It draws from the arts, science, and engineering.  
Design is also linked to sociology by way of the network society, as it is increasingly viewed  
as a collaborative process for value creation. Fostering creativity and innovation is inher-  
ent in the event design process. Design thinking is interdisciplinary in nature, with many  
starting points and applications. Designers can draw on art, computer science, sociology,  
marketing, storytelling, communications, and haptics. In this context, haptics refers to the  
sense of touch.  
Brown and James \(2004, 59\) argued that “Design is essential to an event’s success because it leads to  
improvement of the event on every level”. The core values of the event provide the starting point\:  
why is an event held, and for whom? What is its substance and intended outcomes? Brown  
and James identified five design principles for events that will be discussed later\: scale; shape;  
focus; timing; and build. Underlying these principles is the need for creativity and uniqueness.  
This can be accomplished, in part, by incorporating the rituals and symbols of the host com-  
munity. Silvers \(2004, 5\) summarised the issue\: “Remember that you are packaging and managing  
an experience. This means that you must envision that experience, from start to finish, from the guest’s point  
of view”.  
Berridge \(2007\) discussed the field of experience design, stating that the subject was in its infancy.  
Unfortunately, the term was being used to describe the design of everything from websites \(i.e.,  
digital media\) to storytelling, theme parks, and corporate brand events. Berridge argued that  
the purpose of event design is to create desired perceptions, cognition, and behaviour. Building  
and maintaining relationships is at the core, and stimulating emotional connections through  
engagement is the vehicle. Berridge \(2012b, 278\) also argued that it might be useful to distin-  
guish between “event architecture”, which largely encompasses the technical, ­ problem-solving  
functions of design, and the “artistic or aesthetic design and creation” processes, both of which  
must be combined to create successful event experiences. Many creative challenges exist for  
the event experience designer, including concept and theme, entertainment, staging, ambience,  
decoration, and food and beverage. Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 247  
*Paradigm Shift in Design Thinking*  
Orefice \(2018\) examined the evolution of design thinking and applied new ideas about design  
to events. Drawing upon service-dominant logic and co-production to create value, the ‘event  
design ladder’ \(Figure 11.1\) illustrates how stakeholders are engaged at different levels or dif-  
ferent conceptualisations of design are applied to events. In event production, this remains a  
matter of ‘form’, in which the emphasis is on theming, decor, and creative application of many  
elements of style. Achieving the ‘wow’ response from guests and clients is an explicit aim,  
placing them in the position of passive recipients. Step two in the ladder reflects the experi-  
ence economy paradigm, in which experience design and ROE have entered the lexicon and are  
currently the dominant perspectives. Customers and guests are co-creators of experience in  
this frame, recognising that services and experiences cannot be fabricated like mass-produced  
goods. Value propositions are offered by event producers, and the customer or guest will bring  
their own needs, wants, and level of engagement into the experience. More importantly, users  
give it meaning. More and more thought is being given to how social media shapes the experi-  
ence before, during, and after an event – or any other type of service encounter.  
Step 3, reflecting the most recent theorising about design and marketing, views design in a  
strategic manner. At this level, stakeholders collaborate within dynamic networks to create  
value systems. Picture a single event not as an entertainment, learning, fund-raising, challeng-  
ing, or celebratory opportunity, but as a creator of value for individuals, communities, cultures,  
the economy, and the environment. Events conceived as agents of change \(or as social marketing  
vehicles\) fit this paradigm. This idea is most relevant to event portfolio planning. If events  
within a city or destination are conceived as a value system, rather than an ad hoc or unregulated  
population of independent entities, then the creation of synergies and long-term, cumulative  
outcomes \(i.e., the benefits, or value to be created\) becomes the strategy.

*Can Experiences Be Designed?*  
It is possible to get people involved, have them do specific things, and receive desired stimuli,  
but it is not possible to guarantee or predict what individuals actually experience cognitively  
and emotionally as an outcome. Nor can the event designer know for a certainty what mean-  
ings will be attached to those event experiences, or whether they will have any transforming  
impact. Accordingly, it is accurate to say that experiences cannot be designed, and in many  
cases, the experience cannot be objectively identified through research. People might not be  
able to express clearly in words what they are experiencing or what it means to them, so this  
represents a major challenge to researchers, theorists, and designers.  
An experience is so highly personal that it cannot be planned, designed, or even promised to  
event-goers. The purpose of any event is to suggest what experiences might be had \(through  
theming and interpretation\), facilitate positive experiences \(through the design of setting, pro-  
gramme, services, and consumables\), and enable everyone concerned, as much as possible, to  
realise their goals \(this is co-creation\). On the other hand, design and management also seek to  
constrain undesired experiences, including aggression, violence, and over-stimulation.  
The ‘orchestra model’ was proposed by Pearce and Zare \(2017\) as the basis for teaching ­ tourism-  
experience design. Three experience dimensions are part of the orchestra, namely, cognitive  
\(thinking, choosing, learning, understanding\), affective \(happiness, surprise, fear, love\), and  
conative or behavioural \(taking photos, texting, and physical activities\). These are supple-  
mented with two other components\: sensory \(seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and tasting\)  
and relationships \(guests with service providers, companions, residents, and other guests or  
tourists\). A number of design tools are suggested that emphasise the ‘emic’ perspective, being  
a full understanding of the consumer, participant, or guest leading to co-created experiences.  
The recommended tools include participant observation, cognitive mapping, service blueprinting, and  
stakeholder mapping.  
Customer experience design\: social and digital components  
Fernandes and Krolikowska \(2023\) proposed a new model of customer experience, with design  
implications, following an extensive review of the literature. They considered the importance of  
digital communications and experiences in suggesting that designers must integrate elements  
of the social and digital environments in their design of settings and experiences, with particular  
relevance to links with brands. Digital technologies should be used in several ways, including\:  
user-generated content about the event; online engagement with communities and individuals;  
facilitating social interaction; personalised experiences within interactive programmes; crowd  
sourcing, where appropriate; knowledge exchange; and providing socio-emotional support  
\(i.e., within relational networks\).  
*Creativity and Innovation*  
Jackson, Morgan, and Laws \(2018\) concluded that creativity is under-researched within Event  
Studies. In an effort to get festivals and events recognised as part of the ‘creative industries’, they  
examined the literature on creativity and determined that it requires attention to both the  
individual cognitive and emotional processes and to the environment in which it occurs – a  
position reflecting the view of design as the creation of value systems. Their paper identified “...  
the core facets of creativity in the management of outdoor events. These were fluency, originality, imagina-  
tion, elaboration, environment and complexity”. Fluency refers to the background of creative people, Event Design\: tHeory and Principles often working together\: “There is a pattern to event creation and the power of creativity is dependent  
upon the experience gained over time”. Changing and adapting yields originality, with events being  
different each time they are offered.  
Imagination is inherent in all humans, but often it can be externally stimulated, such as by  
comparison with other events. New ideas have to be discussed, refined, or elaborated, often  
within a dynamic team, and therefore the organisational or stakeholder environment is import-  
ant for supporting risk-taking, or not, and for inspiring people. The complexity of creative  
problem-solving motivates people, with events being a prime example of producing something  
meaningful out of chaos.  
‘Creative capital’ has value, and it has to be attracted or nurtured. For example, Prentice and  
Andersen \(2003, 8\) examined Edinburgh and its positioning as a world-class festival city, say-  
ing it has gained “a unique selling point of creativity as well as heritage”. If the social and political  
environment is supportive, more people are likely to become artists and inventors; if the learn-  
ing environment is oriented in such a way, students at all levels can learn to be more creative.

EXPERT OPINION 11.1\: By Dr. Steve Brown  
Event Design  
I have long held the belief that if one commits to designing \(as opposed to only man-  
aging\) an event with the aim of maximising the experience for the audience, it will lead  
to a more positive and meaningful experience for them. This, in turn, will increase the  
effectiveness of communication of the narrative/theme of the event to the audience. An  
enhanced and targeted experience and a more effective communication method will  
also increase the likelihood of returning business \(should the event be staged again\)  
and of meeting the stated objectives of the event whether those objectives be cultural,  
commercial, personal – or just for fun.  
The use of the application of event design principles and techniques to make it better  
for your audience while increasing the likelihood of meeting your event’s objectives  
would seem an obvious starting point for any event regardless of purpose, budget,  
scale, style, genre, or desired outcome. Indeed, since identifying Event Design as a  
set of principles and techniques in 2004 – based on my own research and professional  
­ practice – I have proof of concept in the staging of a wide range of very successful  
events for which I have been responsible.  
The key to the successful staging of any event is a complete understanding of your audi-  
ence and designing the event based on that understanding. Too often event creators  
\(most frequently called “managers”\) concentrate their efforts on operational/logistical  
issues to the exclusion of making their events audience-centric. The first questions an 250  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
event creator or event organisation needs to identify are the *raison d’être* for the event  
and its target audience. Once these are known the event can be designed specifically  
for that target audience \(not ‘market’\). Events can’t be future-proofed or ensured of  
success even in the short term solely by staging well-managed events for ‘everyone’.  
Evaluation is a critical component of creating and staging the event experience. Pre-  
event, evaluation can obtain simple socio-demographic information that informs the  
event designer about their target audience. The event evaluation enables us to iden-  
tify audience behaviours and how the programme elements and the site design works  
interact with the audience. Post-event evaluation can capture spending patterns, recall  
of information, intention to return and, more importantly, how effectively the event met  
its desired measurable outcomes.  
The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra \(aso\) is, like many orchestras, concerned about  
an ageing audience subscriber base. Their raison d’être for a series of hybrid ‘rock  
band with orchestra’ was to attract younger audiences – starting with ‘baby boomers’  
and gradually working younger. The series has included music by Bowie, Queen, Deep  
Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Muse, and Sigur Rós. To bring younger audiences to  
traditionally successful concerts there was also a gospel version of Handel’s Messiah.  
The programmes included innovative staging designed specifically for the target audi-  
ence to demonstrate the integration of the bands within the orchestra and the power  
and majesty of orchestral performance – all while playing *their* music. The events have  
been very well attended and a mix of formal \(written\) and informal \(standing ovations,  
multiple curtain calls, Facebook, etc.\) evaluation has shown that the objectives have  
been met with an increased commitment to return to the aso for concerts in its ‘stan-  
dard’ programme.  
Event design works. In combination, these simple steps are very powerful and can  
improve any event. Event designers need to become practiced at these steps and  
­ pursue an event design body of knowledge by studying events and by immersing  
­ themselves in the community in which their event will be staged and learning as much  
as they can about their audience. Only then can an event be called designed and not  
just managed.  
# Sensory Stimulation and Mapping  
Research on sensory stimulation at events has been minimal, yet it is clearly an important ele-  
ment in the event experience. Biaett \(2019, 250–251\) observed from personal experience how  
the “infusion of senses and emotions” engaged event attendees. He said,  
At community festivals, the maximized interrelated factors of physical collaborative  
creative activity, stimulated senses, and cyclically aroused emotions, give rise to highly  
festive atmospheres during which social capital bonding and bridging flourishes and  
attendees attain peak levels of liminality with feelings of well being.  
In addition to the traditional five senses, Biaett suggested that attention be given to tem-  
perature, vibration, and balance. Duffy and Mair \(2018\) explored how sensual engagement  
facilitates social engagement, employing an ethnographic methodology and referring to ‘sensual  
geographies’ for theoretical support. Event Design\: tHeory and Principles Each of the five senses is not only important in the design of event experiences, constituting  
some of the elements of style, but also provides the theme for numerous events. Spectacle is  
by definition a larger-than-life visual experience \(i.e., sight\) and is a frequent accompaniment  
to events in the form of costumes, performances, light shows, and fireworks. These are often  
stand-alone performances as well. Taste is the essence of food and beverage events, popular  
the world over, and food and beverage hospitality is also an essential component of almost all  
events that last more than a couple of hours.  
The sounds of music are incredibly varied and therefore provide unlimited possibilities for  
themed events, from popular music to the classics, with either musicians/composers or the  
style of music being celebrated. Touch \(or haptics\) such as hands-on experiences in preparing  
food, are of great importance to people who want to learn, be creative, and gain immediate  
satisfaction from their work. Perhaps the least utilised sense in event theming is smell, but it  
does provide a starting point for flower shows and perfume fairs, and, as every restaurateur  
knows, smells entice people to eat and drink, to enter a venue and linger. Smell also carries the  
advantage of being associated with memories, so that a smell can, years later, invoke a pleasant  
or unpleasant experience. It is worth noting that recalling unpleasant experiences can become  
amusing over time, leading to entertaining stories and tall tales.  
Lindenberg \(2013\) noted that lighting is one of a number of sensory cues that can affect human  
behaviour. Experiments have shown, for example, that lower levels result in greater interper-  
sonal intimacy and quieter or reduced conversation. That is why event designers reduce lighting  
just before the curtain rises or the speakers take the stage, in order to quiet the audience. On  
the other hand, soft lighting during a banquet will likely encourage quiet conversation. People  
have colour preferences, and colours affect mood. Colour can be manipulated through lighting  
or other design features. Perceived spaciousness can be influenced by colours and lighting,  
helping to reduce feelings of crowding. Colour theory relates to how specific media affect colour  
appearance \(i.e., the effects of context on colour appearance\) whereas colour psychology consid-  
ers the effects of colours on feelings and behaviour \(e.g., will a pink room really calm prisoners  
and a red room increase tension? Does blue make people feel calm and cool?\). Colour symbolism  
is culturally defined, as whether red suggests heat, anger, or danger – or all three.  
Desirable sounds motivate event attendance, and people will travel a long way for the right  
sounds and the musicians who create them. Noise, on the other hand, is an undesired sound.  
We can measure sound by decibels, and when the intensity is high it can cause annoyance or  
pain. Persistent, loud noise is universally shunned, as it is both physically bothersome and gets  
in the way of desired conversations or other interactions. Yet loud noise is also expected by  
many concert goers, so we always have to consider motivation and the physical characteristics  
of the listeners \(e.g., old versus young, gender, and cultural backgrounds\) before labelling  
sounds as unwanted noise. There are huge differences between rock concerts and classical  
music in terms of who attends, and what sounds they want or noise levels they will tolerate.  
Quiet, ambient music has been found to be relaxing, although many people are rather sick of  
the elevator music we are too often subjected to. Research related to sounds and events has  
been rare.  
The paper by Waitt and Duffy \(2010\) explored “...what ears and listening can add to the under-  
standing of the interconnections between festival spaces and people. This project adopted an interdisciplinary  
approach that acknowledges listening as simultaneously a neurological, psychological and culturally situated  
process”. Waitt, Gorman-Murray, and Gibson \(2011\) reported on how  
… An embodied sense of rhythm can add to understandings of the relationship  
between festival spaces and people. Insights are given to how the rhythmic qualities of  
251 252  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
sound help orientate bodies in festival spaces, and how bodies produce festival space  
through embodied responses to the rhythmic qualities of sound.  
Tasting is obviously the critical factor in dining experiences, and tastes can be manipulated in  
other event environments to stimulate emotional and behavioural responses. The popularity of  
‘taste of’ events, themed with an endless variety of foodstuff, recipes, and cultural associations,  
is universal. This form of taste should not be confused with tastefulness, as in how one dresses  
or acts, which can be viewed as an element of cultural capital. Everett \(2012\) used the term  
‘tastescape’ to describe areas that appeal to food tourists on the basis of purity and escape, and  
in this context both forms of taste and tastefulness are relevant. From research on foodies and  
food tourism \(Getz et al., 2014\) it is clear that foodies \(or food lovers\) can be defined by a set  
of attitudes and behaviours that emphasise a love of cooking and strong preferences for quality  
in the sourcing and preparation of their food. The emphasis on quality leads foodies to mar-  
kets where fresh and local produce is the appeal, and to seek authentic food experiences \(with  
special events being highly appealing\) as cultural tourists. Some foodies, and many others who  
would never want to use that term, believe in healthy and sustainable food habits, and this is  
only in part related to taste or tastefulness. Whatever the perspective taken, there is absolutely  
no doubt that taste is a major motivator of travel and event attendance \(Plate 11.1\).  
Exhibit designers understand that involvement with displays is better than mere visual stim-  
ulation. Getting people to touch-and-try is one key step towards learning or buying. Harvey  
et al. \(1998\) discovered that they could more than double the time visitors spent at exhibits  
by making them interactive and multisensory and providing better lighting and easier-to-read  
lettering. Visitors felt more immersed in the overall museum experience.  
*Sensory Mapping*  
This is a tool that can be used in conjunction with other methods to evaluate or improve expe-  
riences at events. In particular, the visitor experiences of people with special needs, children,  
the elderly, or those unfamiliar with certain environments can benefit from an array of sensory  
stimulation. Site planning can be modified to maximise exposure to smells, for example, or to  
minimise them. Combined with service mapping, specific reactions to light, sound, smell, etc.  
can form part of the evaluation of overall service and programme quality. Combining sensory  
data as perceived by users, designers can identify hot or cold spots where stimulation, delight, or  
disgust is concentrated.  
Figure 11.2 provides an example of how a sensory map can be linked to service mapping by  
participant observers, or on the basis of user feedback, during an entire event experience – from  
entry to the site, through various experience opportunities, to departure. In this example, the  
five senses are represented by circles, and these can be enlarged relative to each other depend-  
ing on their importance in any area or at particular points in time. They could also be colour-  
coded, or substituted with radar graphs. It is possible that all five senses are engaged to some  
extent all the time, but one or more are likely to dominate – or should dominate by design.  
Instead of examining the senses within a flow of event experiences, the setting or venue itself  
can be mapped in advance, leading to design modifications. For example, where \(and when in  
the flow\) do you want the visitor to experience that visual “Wow” experience? At the entrance,  
or when the entertainment begins and everyone is seated? Where in the large fair site, for  
example, will smells and tastes be maximised? Combining sensory mapping with cognitive map-  
ping \(for wayfaring\) should help improve site planning, programming, and the overall event  
experience. Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 253

Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy, but aesthetic appeal is usually associated with art and  
can involve all of the five senses. That is why we can talk about culinary arts, visual arts, etc.  
Aesthetic design elements might also hold symbolic meaning, and this can be manipulated by  
event designers. For example, certain colours, design features \(like expensive art\), and shapes  
or patterns are associated with political ideologies, royalty, lifestyles, social class, or other  
potentially unifying or controversial themes.  
*Sensation Seeking, Arousal, and Optimal Stimulation*  
According to Zuckerman \(1979\), sensation seeking is a core personality trait, defined by the  
search for experiences and feelings that are “varied, novel, complex and intense”. Risk-taking is  
often part of this trait, but so is novelty seeking without risks. Research has demonstrated  
large differences among people in terms of their preference for sensory stimulation. People  
who are high sensation seekers, generally more males than females, require a lot of stimulation 254

to reach their personal “optimal level of arousal”. The components of sensation seeking are thrills  
and adventure, unconventional experiences, disinhibition \(e.g., participation in out-of-control  
activities\), and intolerance of boredom.  
Interpersonal and environmental stimuli cause responses, both physiological and psycholog-  
ical, triggering behavioural responses. Sometimes event designers want to increase arousal,  
as in fostering celebration or revelry, and at other times they decrease stimulation in order  
to foster reverence or attentiveness. People have a limited capacity for dealing with a lot of  
stimulation and can become over-stimulated. When this happens, it can trigger withdrawal or  
anxiety, and it will usually result in a filtering of stimuli to focus on the necessary or desirable  
inputs. Another strategy frequently employed by people is to attempt to eliminate or adjust the  
stimulus, such as by screening information, turning down noise and light levels, or engaging in  
conversation in order to mask an annoying or boring speaker.  
*Environmental Stress*  
Environmental stress theory analyses how stress factors affect people, communities, and cultures,  
and their responses to stress. When things feel out of control, beyond our ability to cope, we  
feel stress. So too when the environment poses danger, or we perceive risks. Event settings or  
programmes that generate sensory overload, overcrowding, nasty surprises, bad behaviour on  
the part of other guests, or poorly managed environmental systems can cause stress. A lack of  
knowledge about what is happening can generate fear and stress, so timely communications are  
always essential. According to Bilotta and Evans \(2013, 28\), chronic environmental stressors Event Design\: tHeory and Principles cause the greatest harm, such as when people are exposed to continuous noise or air pollution,  
whereas acute stressors are those we would expect from temporary events, including crowding,  
noise, excessive waiting, sensory overloads, overwhelming security, or fear of being trapped.  
Berlonghi \(1990, 73\) concluded that panic at events is likely to stem from real or perceived  
threats, and he discussed eight crowd characteristics to help managers or security personnel  
identify crowd problems and security threats. Freedman \(1975\) also experimented with ‘conta-  
gion’, which is the rapid spread of emotions or behaviour through a group or crowd. This phe-  
nomenon obviously has a direct bearing on events, as in some cases we want to foster positive  
contagion \(especially celebration and humour\) and in others it is very bad \(fear and fighting\).  
255  
*Personal Space*  
What is the difference between intimacy, personal distance, social distance, and public dis-  
tance? We want intimacy with lovers and family, but not strangers. We tolerate crowds, even  
seek them out, when a certain atmosphere is desired. At meetings, we might feel uncomfort-  
able if the seats are too close. Hall \(1966\) identified the four spatial zones, with ‘intimate dis-  
tance’ being 0 to 1.5 feet \(touching and feeling distance, with lots of contact and various sensory  
exchanges\). ‘Personal distance’ is 1.5 to 4 feet \(mostly verbal and visual contacts; contacts with  
friends and regular acquaintances\). ‘Social distance’ is 4 to 12 feet \(impersonal and business-like  
eye and voice contacts, no touching, normal voice levels\). Fourth, ‘public distance’ is over 12 feet  
\(formality, as in students’ relationship to a lecturer in a classroom; when the need exists for  
technical assistance or raising one’s voice\).  
A related concept is territoriality, which refers to a tendency for similar groups to stick together  
and apart from other groups. Within- and between-group interactions are easy to observe in  
most social settings, such as the little cliques that form at parties. If you want people to join in,  
leave an obvious opening, as in a crescent, but if you feel exclusionary, form a tight little knot  
with everyone facing inwards. Another form of territoriality occurs when people protect space  
for themselves or their group, like reserving seats or claiming tables at a banquet.  
*Using Positive Psychology in Designing Events*  
Coghlan \(2015\) examined how to harness the key tenets of positive psychology into the design  
principles for events to achieve eudaimonic states \(i.e., the state of mind where an individual can  
flourish and be happy\) so that their sense of well-being is enhanced. Coghlan pointed to five  
predictors of well-being that have been identified as enhancing eudaimonic states\:  
Intentional activity is derived from the literature on leisure where physical activity contributes  
to happiness \(especially when combined with something like a charity event, which Coghlan  
studied\).  
Motivation and goal attainment\: intrinsic motivation with self-set goals which can be attained – as  
well as setting mini goals within the event.  
Activation of signature strengths\: Coghlan described these as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviours  
of individuals that can contribute to the reward of participation such as endurance, a sense of  
community, leadership, and so forth.  
Positive emotions and gratification, where positive emotions help to achieve a state of authentic  
happiness which may be displayed through enjoyment, engagement, and satisfaction with the  
event. 256  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
Sharing positive events, where individuals recount and reminisce about events in the past.  
Coghlan highlighted the value of appropriate forms of event design to incorporate these prin-  
ciples, whereby the intentional element can be achieved from the point of sign-up to the end  
of the charity event. The study lays the groundwork for the further development of well-being  
and event research.  
Neuhofer et al. \(2021\) relied on environmental psychology to inform their innovative study  
of the Burning Man Festival, which they described as having the reputation of being a large-  
scale, transformative experience. They used Instagram data from before, during, and after the  
event to analyse digital expressions of experience, revealing and mapping 30 clusters that could  
trigger transformation. Clusters occurred in both an “outer socio-environmental sphere and an inner  
socio-psychological sphere, which, together, render the experience as a liminal space-time vehicle, giving rise  
to transformational festivals” \(p. 11\). Findings highlighted the importance of communitas, posi-  
tive emotions, and social engagement.  
*Evidence and Research-Based Design*  
A purely artistic approach to design is suitable for some performances, but when designing  
events and their programming it is highly recommended to base goals, design concepts, and the  
evaluation process on available evidence, and that can only be obtained through evaluation and  
other research. The process is dedicated to basing decisions on credible research and evidence  
from praxis to achieve desired outcomes. The example described below is for the design of food  
and wine events, but the approach is adaptable to many other situations.  
At many events, the food and beverage service is incidental to the main theme and programme  
and can be considered part of hospitality, but at others, it is experientially paramount. In par-  
ticular, research has demonstrated the importance of events in satisfying the special interests of  
food and wine lovers, whether they stay close to home or travel the globe in search of rewarding  
gastronomic experiences. Getz et al. \(2014\) provided the research evidence for the design con-  
cept that is illustrated here \(also see Getz et al., 2013; Getz, 2013b; Getz and Robinson, 2014\).  
Most food and beverage events are focused on consumption – eating and drinking. Throw in some  
entertainment \(and maybe some family fun\) and the typical hedonistic food or beverage event  
emerges. But this is not what highly involved food and wine lovers want from their event experi-  
ences. As a theoretical base, involvement theory \(or ego-involvement or leisure involvement\) has been  
employed to identify the core characteristics of being a foodie or a wine lover and to profile wine  
and food tourists on the basis of their level of involvement \(this being a segmentation method\).  
Attending events has been revealed as being highly attractive, but more importantly, the desired  
experiential components that separate the highly involved from those who attend primarily for  
consumption or socialising have been identified. This model reflects demand-side thinking in  
which design follows from market intelligence. Of course, many existing food and wine-related  
events are based on tradition and will not necessarily want to follow this approach. It is highly  
appropriate for event-tourism purposes and the private sector seeking profit.  
Conceptually, Figure 11.3 shows the necessity for positioning food or wine events in such a  
way that they can attract dedicated food/wine tourists, and not merely provide generic benefits.  
The designed wine or food event for the highly involved segments can be stand-alone, such as  
a tasting at a restaurant or demonstrations by experts, or part of a larger festival. The designer  
starting with this concept can manifest the various core benefits with actual programming. For  
example, the learning benefit includes mastery of techniques, leading to cooking classes with  
chefs or wine blending with the winemaker. The creativity benefit includes aesthetic appreciation, Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 257

why and how various foods have become traditions in local cuisine, or of the legendary wine  
pioneers.  
# Dramaturgy and Design  
As explained in the expert opinion by Vassilios Ziakas, dramaturgy offers deep insights into  
symbolic representations that impart shared meanings in events.  
EXPERT OPINION 11.2\: By Dr. Vassilios Ziakas  
Events Civic Dramaturgy  
*Dramaturgy\: the symbolic representations that instantiate shared meanings in events*  
*\(Ziakas and Costa, 2011\)*  
The capacity of events, mainly through celebration and ritual, to generate communal  
symbolic meaning for groups and communities, and thus enable collective action is  
widely recognised. But while it is valued as the greatest strength of events, it is not 258  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
thoroughly understood apart from ritual studies \(Turner, 1969\). The symbolic constitu-  
tion of shared meaning configurations and the underlying processes of their creation  
remain unexplored in contemporary event-related scholarship. Event Studies fail to  
account for how representational meaning-making performances, interactions, sto-  
ries, signs, icons, metaphors or allegories shape social relations, spaces, and systems.  
They actually overlook the very core of symbolic performance that events enable\: the  
*drama* – that is an overwhelming meaning-making social praxis performed as much in  
everyday life as in events trying to make sense of the world and the place of people in  
it through means of symbolic action \(Turner, 1974\).  
The notion of dramaturgy brings to light conditions and modalities of communal mean-  
ing creation in events. However, it is often merely \(and falsely\) confused with Goffman’s  
symbolic interactionist view of individuals’ social action as a theatrical performance.  
Event dramaturgy departs from Goffman’s perspective considerably as it extends the  
study of symbolic action to collective performances that enact some sort of *social drama*  
to foster shared meaning for groups and communities. It sheds light on how liminality  
and communitas compose a communal ‘theatrical-like’ stage whereupon social drama  
is performed through the embodiment of symbolic event performances. It thus seeks  
to interpret embodied performances as a form of social drama, as meta-commentaries  
entailing polysemic structures that yield a variety of interconnected hedonic, atmo-  
spheric, and imaginative effects. This constitutes a dramaturgic process of ‘symbolic  
world-making’, as we showed in the case of a freediving event \(Ziakas et al., 2022\),  
which assists in \(re\)constructing alternate social realities and reinstitutes kinship links  
among people sharing common values within the event spaces.  
The above study has led me to formulate the resultant civic perspective of dramaturgy,  
which provides a comprehensive and discursive dramatological analytic of symbolic  
action and expressive culture in collective embodied performances \(Ziakas, 2021\). In  
line with my earlier work \(Ziakas and Costa, 2010a, 2011\), I defined civic dramaturgy  
in events as the extraction of shared meanings stemming from the co-performance  
of symbolic representations. With this dramatological lens, my intent is to examine  
how polysemic structures, formulated by symbols, narratives, and genres, instantiate  
symbolic representations in embodied performances. Subsequently, through this prism  
I view symbolic action to be performatively and conjointly experienced, nurturing a  
communal mindset that enables collective action. In all, this perspective shifts focus on  
the engrained mechanisms of civic dramaturgy. It is a novel theoretical analytic to study  
symbolic action and embodied event performances.  
In Figure 11.4, we can see a schematic illustration of the civic dramatological analytic.  
This lens integrates the ritualistic, theatrical, aesthetic, and performative aspects of  
social drama to investigate the construction of polysemic meaning structures \(at cogni-  
tive, affective, and conative levels\) that derive from layered symbols, multiple narratives,  
and embedded genres such as rituals, festivals, arts, or games. Polysemic structures  
carry intents, worldviews, and mentalities to be voiced in the embodied performances of  
symbolisms and imaginaries. These allegorical representations are portrayed and per-  
formed within symbolic social spaces that have the capacity to facilitate metaphoric dis-  
course. This way the dramaturgical subtext is made up encompassing what is being said,  
deliberated, and negotiated in a social drama. The intended subtext can be inscribed  
in event elements, settings, and activities forming prepared and rehearsed scripts Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 259

and/or extended improvisational scenarios of action. We need to know how to divulge  
the subtext and pinpoint the means that can enhance symbolisms through their col-  
lective performance within event spaces \(in ritualistic, theatrical, aesthetic, and perfor-  
mative terms\). More importantly, we should bear in mind that for symbolic meaning to  
take shape and be crystalised in the public sphere, it should be instantiated and exem-  
plified within its performative event context. To fully understand this multi-­ layered  
process, we should look into the factors and settings working as instantiating con-  
duits \(or instantiators\) that form shared meaning. Because symbolic action is perfor-  
matively and collectively experienced, civic dramaturgy has the potential to promote  
an outlook for collective action. As a result, the instantiation of symbolic action enables  
event attendees to affirm, challenge, contest, or transform social orders that make up  
their relations, spaces, and systems. By examining processes of instantiation, we can  
appreciate the mechanisms of civic dramaturgy and how to leverage symbolic action  
through events.  
Therefore, I stress that it is imperative to reinstate the place of drama in event scholar-  
ship, and clear confusion from common misconceptions about the essence of drama in  
event settings and behaviours. I suggest that civic dramaturgy can progress our under-  
standing of events as an entanglement of embodied practices and contribute to the  
literature by complementing and expanding extant performance studies and theory.  
The dramatological analytic can be taken up by future researchers to promote interdis-  
ciplinary investigation of events and attendant phenomena interlinked with symbols,  
social interactions, imaginaries, and cultures.  
The Authentic Big Blue Event on the Greek Island of Amorgos  
It is an international freediving competition that celebrates the film Big Blue \(1988\)  
by Luc Besson, which was shot for the most part on the island. Its dramaturgy blend-  
ing sport and art \(film scene re-enactments and underwater gallery photo exhibition\)  
instantiates freediving ideals and the legacy of the film that put Amorgos on the map  
as a tourism destination. See Plate 11.2. 260

and strong co-creation in a spectrum. Rather than thinking in terms of designing the co-creation  
of experiences and value, Pernecky argued that it should be an emergent process. This Event Design\: tHeory and Principles will be more achievable in smaller organisations without rigid, centralized decision-making.  
The resulting “democratic ecosystem” advocated by Pernecky might actually be more feasible in  
portfolios, wherein events collaborate. This would constitute strategic design at a macro level.

# Designing Event Settings  
Event settings are places that have to be defined as special for the duration of the ‘time out of time’  
that constitutes a planned event. The main initial considerations are location \(e.g., centrality  
and accessibility\), site characteristics \(is it suitable for the event?\), and the social–cultural con-  
text \(has it got historical and cultural meaning?\). Infrastructure and management systems then  
have to be developed or modified, including basic services, theme and programme, amenities  
and guest services, security, and controls. Generic types of event settings are described below.  
Assembly\: These are settings for meetings, conventions, concerts, festivals, and spectator  
sports – any event bringing together large numbers of people where seating, viewing, and lis-  
tening are core design functions. Sports arenas and stadia were once entirely outdoors, but now  
indoor facilities are preferred for major events plus entertainment functions. Theatres can be  
stand-alone or part of convention/exhibition centres, arts complexes, educational institutions,  
or commercial resorts and hotels. An event manager can often rent assembly venues that have  
their own management systems, and those who operate such venues are automatically in the  
event business.  
Virtual assembly spaces are coming into their own, see Plate 4.1 Simulations attempt to enable  
social interaction, not merely viewing and listening. Plate 6.1 shows a more traditional assem-  
bly with speakers and viewers. The huge arena displayed in Plate 17.1, from Auckland, facili-  
tates both major sport events and concerts. In Plate 3.1, an outdoor setting, the golf course, has  
been transformed for spectator and media events by adding temporary seating.  
Parade or Procession\: Parades, flotillas, cavalcades, marches, and other similar events are lin-  
ear, mobile forms of entertainment, spectacle or ritual with special design and management  
requirements. The audience might be standing, seated, or moving along with the procession.  
The most common linear setting, however, is a street with a static audience along the route.  
Some processions pass through seating areas in stadia, where they take on the form of the-  
atre, as in Rio de Janeiro’s Carnival. Logistics for such events are challenging, such as getting  
everyone in a parade or race mobilised for proper sequencing, the likelihood of causing traffic  
disruption and congestion, and the fact that most streets are unsuited for watching parades.  
Linear-nodal\: Many sport events involve races or other linear forms of activity, including  
long-distance running and auto racing, which combine elements of procession with nodes of  
activity. Usually, the audience congregates at the nodes, such as start, finish, and transition  
points, but could be dispersed along the entire route, like a parade. The event designer will  
often have to provide live video feeds from the linear portions to the places where fans congre-  
gate. Service points for athletes and vehicles are also needed. The establishment of fan zones  
at major sport events has become a common practice, and this can be viewed as experience  
augmentation or co-creation. The fan zone experience, as Woratschek et al. \(2017\) concluded,  
enabled the highly desired benefits of shared experience and the freedom to move around.  
Plate 1.2 depicts the opening of Gravel Royale which would be a linear event except that it  
requires overnight, temporary accommodation in tent villages \(Plate 10.1\). TransRockies races  
mostly start and finish in towns, adding to the event nodes. 262  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
Open space\: Events make use of parks, plazas, and closed-off streets, especially in publicly  
sponsored events designed to appeal to mass audiences. Free movement is a feature of these  
settings, but they usually also contain sub-areas for assembly, procession, and exhibition/sales.  
European cities seem to have the advantage in terms of beautiful, culturally significant squares  
for events \(although they are often over-crowded in peak travel seasons\) while North American  
cities tend to have more space, such as waterfronts and natural parks to use for large pub-  
lic gatherings \(Getz, 2001\). Environmental concerns are important in parks, while potential  
damage to buildings is a concern in urban plazas. Smith \(2016\) examined both the positives  
and negatives of utilising public spaces for events, and conflicts often occur when residents  
perceive a loss of space or feel direct, negative impacts. Outdoor sport facilities of all types  
serve as event venues, and increasingly sport complexes have been built with sport tourism as  
a top priority. Just how residents and visitors attending events manage to share such facilities  
is a challenge for managers.  
Several open space festival settings are illustrated in the book, both from cities and the great  
outdoors.  
Exhibition/sales\: Purpose-built exhibition and convention centres are the best suited for trade  
and consumer shows, although any event can incorporate areas for food and beverages, or  
other merchandise sales and demonstrations. These settings are designed to entice entry and  
circulation, browsing, and sales. Sometimes the audience merely views the exhibits; at other  
venues, sales are made. Since the purpose of these events is usually commerce, a number of  
principles from environmental psychology have to be applied to the design in order to ensure  
that interpersonal contacts are facilitated. Good circulation is necessary, but it is also desirable  
to have people linger and talk.  
*Event Settings as Restorative or Instorative Environments*  
Setting affordances are those objective characteristics of the venue or setting that make certain  
actions and behaviours possible. For example, an attractive, spacious function room presents  
many social possibilities to dinner guests, but without wheelchair accessibility, some people  
cannot enter. Affordance is also a concept rooted in cognition and environmental psychology,  
emphasising perceived affordances. Regardless of the intentions of venue managers or event  
producers, people’s perception of what is possible, and what is a barrier, can differ greatly. All  
settings will offer something the event designer can exploit, but also present limitations. It  
is related to the spectrum of event settings, wherein built venues in urban environments are  
quite different from natural areas in what an event designer can and should do to facilitate the  
desired experiences. In some cases, a setting will have to be rejected because there is a mis-  
match. Also, consider the ways in which settings and events can work harmoniously to reduce  
stress and enhance well-being.  
Festivals and events can be restorative in terms of reducing the stress of daily life, or instorative  
by way of fostering mood enhancement and an improved sense of well-being. Environmental  
psychologists know that exposure to nature can be restorative \(Joye and van den Berg, 2013\),  
and that means holding events in parks and gardens, or in areas with water features, can have  
positive results. On the other hand, many events held outdoors do not facilitate rest and relax-  
ation, with competitive sports and noisy music concerts being the prime examples. Indoors,  
the ambient conditions provided by designers \(including lighting, layout, temperature, plants, Event Design\: tHeory and Principles water features, noise suppression, pleasant smells, and mystery\), can be restorative through  
facilitation of physical and psychological comfort and opportunities for reflection, as demon-  
strated by Packer and Bond \(2010\) for museums.  
263  
*Over-Stimulation or Complexity*  
The well-known phenomenon of mental fatigue has to be understood by event designers. View-  
ers, shoppers, listeners, and tasters can only devote so much attention before becoming men-  
tally fatigued, experiencing the kind of sensory overload that prevents further enjoyment. If  
you are tasting wines or food delicacies, there is a limit beyond which discrimination of taste  
ceases to exist. In a museum, visitors eventually start passing by many exhibits without stop-  
ping because they have already absorbed enough. The same kind of mental fatigue can result  
in conventioneers skipping sessions, students falling asleep in class \(boredom might also be a  
factor\) or visitors to art exhibits merely glancing at outstanding works of art. Event designers  
can plan their setting to focus attention quickly on the primary exhibits or other features, to  
reach visitors prior to fatigue setting in. Lecturers, speakers, and textbook authors can hit the  
highlights first, then go on to the more mundane details.  
*Attraction Gradients*  
This concept refers to the ways in which people move in relation to the objects of their atten-  
tion, or in other words, how do you ensure that what you have to offer or exhibit gets the  
attendees’ attention? Some positions in an exhibition, for example, are better than others.  
There will be a gradient of high to low-traffic sites, with those facing the entrance having  
the highest. Being located next to the free food and drinks helps! Typically exhibition owners  
charge more for the larger and better-located sites within the venue, based on knowledge of  
how these factors affect viewing and sales.  
*The Kaplan \(1987\) Preference Model for Environments*  
The Kaplan \(1987\) model, from environmental psychology, helps to predict people’s prefer-  
ences for various types of environments. There are four basic considerations that can be used  
as design principles for event settings\:  
1 ‘Coherence’\: the scene is organised, and everything hangs together.  
2 ‘Legibility’\: we can categorise or understand the setting, everything is clear.  
3 ‘Complexity’\: a measure of the number and variety of elements in the setting.  
4 ‘Mystery’\: hidden information or surprises are present, and we are drawn into the setting to  
learn more.  
Too much complexity or mystery, however, can be a bad thing. Mystery can be incompatible  
with legibility, and can potentially become frightening. If the event designer provides light and  
dark contrasts, the viewer might be drawn in, whereas too dark a room can be scary. Also,  
consider an empty room versus one in which people are present. Are we normally inclined to  
enter a space in which no other people are present? What appeals to people for meetings, trade  
shows, and learning seminars might be quite different from settings for sports, public celebra-  
tions, and private parties. 264  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
*Cognitive Mapping and Wayfinding*  
Cognitive mapping is the process of acquiring, coding, storing, and recalling \(and eventually  
utilising\) information about the environment, such as where things are located or how to get  
there. We therefore hold mental images, or constructs, of the spatial patterns and relationships  
that are important to us, based on everyday experience \(and perhaps studying maps or search-  
ing Google\). Wayfinding is how we navigate, and in novel situations like going to an event for  
the first time, or moving into a large venue, we might have difficulty. In unfamiliar surround-  
ings, we need information, both graphic and text, as well as other cues as to what movement  
is either required \(such as “no entry”\) or optional \(such as “kids’ village this way”\). Cues can  
be provided by sensory stimulation \(e.g., dark areas discourage traffic\) or the organisation and  
design of a venue.  
Coherence and legibility are important when it comes to environmental preferences, so how do  
we translate that into event design, and how does it impact event experiences? Bateson \(1989\)  
said that legibility is crucial in all ‘servicescapes’ because customers arrive with expectations of  
how the site will function. These are, of course, social constructs, such as the notion that festi-  
val sites should always have a main stage and a food/beverage area, toilets have to be close-by,  
and accommodation in a tent village will be within walking or viewing distance.  
Lynch \(1960\) provided the classic approach to cognitive mapping in cities, with implications  
for event settings. His key principles should be applied to event site planning so that people can  
easily understand the layout and efficiently navigate within it. The larger and more complex the  
site, the more important it is to strive for coherence and legibility. Lynch stressed the following  
features for optimal wayfinding.  
‘nodes’\: activity places \(provide a central stage and entertainment area within a park;  
arrange the venue to have multiple, easily located focal points\)  
‘paths’\: routes people follow \(direction and flow within an event venue has to be  
controlled; use signs and edges\)  
‘landmarks’\: shapes, signs, or symbols that everyone can see and refer to \(e.g., every  
world’s fair builds a monument, usually in the centre\)  
‘districts’\: neighbourhoods, shopping centres, and other themed areas \(group  
compatible activities together\)  
‘edges’\: perceptual or real barriers between districts \(people should recognise where  
they are in relation to other districts\).  
Lynch also found age and gender differences in how people wayfare, and there are probably  
many cultural differences as well. This suggests a research project for application to a variety  
of event sites. Barker’s \(1968\) behaviour settings can also be adapted to fit different circum-  
stances and goals. The three generic means of control pertain to\:  
‘Access’ \(who gets in, or under what schedule\)  
‘Design capacity’ \(i.e., the numbers allowed; consider peak and average attendance\)  
‘Flow’ \(time spent on-site; turnover rates\). It is also necessary to consider accessibil-  
ity for persons with physical and other disabilities or special needs Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 265  
*The Affective Quality of Places*  
A model by Russell and Lanius \(1984\), called “adaptation level and the affective appraisal of environ-  
ments” holds the premise that emotional reactions to environments can be described in words  
along two continua\: from pleasant to unpleasant, and from arousing to sleepy. Forty descriptors  
were developed through research, falling into these four quadrants\:  
1 Highly arousing and highly pleasant \(e.g., exciting, exhilarating, interesting\).  
2 Highly arousing and unpleasant \(e.g., distressing, frenzied, tense, hectic\).  
3 Unarousing and unpleasant \(e.g., dull, dreary, unstimulating\).  
4 Unarousing but pleasant \(e.g., serene, tranquil, peaceful, restful\).  
Russell and Lanius determined through experimentation that the same stimulus \(they used  
photographs\) can generate widely different affective appraisals. In other words, setting design-  
ers cannot be certain that their work will elicit the intended emotional response. One major  
reason is that people adapt to the environment and particular stimuli, so they react differently  
after related experiences.  
*Theatrical Design Principles*  
Theatre is one form of planned event, and theatres are common event settings, but as already  
discussed theatre is also a metaphor for performances and events of all kinds. There is ample  
scope for the event designer to draw upon theatrical productions to enhance event settings  
and experiences. Experience design according to Haahti and Komppula \(2006\) draws heavily  
on dramaturgy which is part of theatre and performance studies. They provide examples in  
which high-contact, high-involvement tourists co-create experiences with professional stagers  
or facilitators. Ideas for ‘manuscripts’ and ‘staged experiences’ have to be generated with the needs  
and expectations of guests in mind, embodying myths, stories, and history from the place or  
event. “This enables the creation of a place and a space for being together and the development of a group  
identity in experiencing” \(ibid., 103\). In this approach, the stage is whatever venue the experience  
takes place in, but it has to be appropriate to the design.  
Staging\: This is the most fundamental theatrical concept, based on the fact that plays and  
many other performances are usually produced in a specific \(assembly\) venue with a stage  
and an audience. Staging or stagecraft applies to both the layout of this type of setting and  
to what is done on the stage \(or within the entire performance space, whatever it is\) to  
facilitate the performance and enhance the audience’s experience.  
Scripting and choreography\: In most forms of theatrical performance the script is followed  
to the letter. How appropriate this is at other events is a matter of style and intent. In some  
respects, a schedule of activities, or the event programme, is a script. As an alternative,  
specific elements of an event can be scripted while the overall performance is improvised, or  
merely themed. Choreography, borrowed from dance, is an alternative approach to events.  
Here, characters and interactions are suggested through notations, but the actual behaviour  
of performers is somewhat creative and unpredictable.  
Timing and build\: Timing, or scheduling, has to consider the audience’s attention span and  
responses to stimuli, keeping in mind that “event time is different from real time and audiences  
respond differently to it”. In general, Brown and James \(2004, 61\) recommended programming 266  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
tightly and accurately to maintain flow and contact with the audience. ‘Build’ is the use of  
time and programming, including ebbs and peaks of intensity, to maximise impact on the  
audience. There is a skill in using limited resources to achieve great emotional or intellec-  
tual stimulation.  
Brown and James \(2004\) discussed five specific theatrical applications to events. Scale, shape,  
and focus apply to the setting, whereas timing and build come under the heading of scripting  
or programming.  
Scale\: It is important to match the scale of the event or activity to the venue, in part to ensure  
the audience can see and understand what is happening. This principle will affect decisions  
on whether to stress the visual over the aural, and three-dimensional over two-dimensional.  
The audience needs enclosure but does not want to feel restricted.  
Shape\: Drawing from environmental psychology, knowledge of how an audience relates to,  
and moves within an environment, is essential. Removing visual and tangible clutter or dis-  
tractions, and keeping things simple and legible, are important design principles for event  
settings.  
Focus\: The use of blocking techniques from theatre and film direction ensures that the  
­ audience concentrates on what the designer/programmer wants it to focus on. Consider  
how lighting, colour, movement, and shape affect people \(this draws on both cognitive and  
environmental psychology\).  
Design Capacity\: Several interrelated connotations of capacity have to be considered by event  
designers, as follows\:  
–  
–  
–  
abiding by legal attendance or occupancy limits \(i.e., how many people are allowed in a  
room, in a venue, or in a space as regulated by fire marshals or other officials?\).  
determining the capacity of an open-air site, by reference to the desired experience,  
emergency evacuation, security, and impact on the environment.  
evaluating perceptual capacity \(this relates to perceived crowding, or how guests/cus-  
tomers feel safe and comfortable with a given density\).  
An important question in all settings will relate to servicing the expected audience. Specifi-  
cally, how much is needed for food, water, tents, car parking, and staff? Being able to forecast  
attendance and other needs is critical to supply management. It is a very high-risk strategy to  
allow unlimited access to an event and then try to match supplies to the actual demand. The  
safer alternative is to establish a design capacity, then restrict attendance to numbers that can be  
accommodated \(with reference to both physical capacity and desired level of service quality\).  
Modularisation of an event can be used to combine these strategies by setting design capacities  
for critical elements \(such as concerts\) and allowing open attendance at others \(e.g., parades\).  
How long does it take to sell tickets, get people through security, for customers to buy food,  
or use the toilets? Efficiency studies are often needed to identify bottlenecks and management  
solutions. Capacity can often be increased, and wait times reduced, by either physical redesign,  
changes in staffing, or the addition or deletion of certain services within the site or venue.  
A related issue is deciding that a site is at capacity and no-one else can be allowed in. That can  
pose problems, not the least of which is disgruntled people who want to get in.  
One of the severe challenges facing many event producers is the fact that if tickets are not sold  
\(for concerts and dinners\), the revenue is lost. In technical terms, this kind of capacity cannot  
be stored, it is perishable. That is why the practice of revenue or yield management is required. Event Design\: tHeory and Principles A related consideration is the capacity to absorb tourism, which requires stakeholder engagement  
and a political decision on what types of tourists, how many, when, and where they can be  
accommodated in a community without doing harm and arousing complaints of over-tourism.  
267  
*Evaluation of Settings*  
Customer satisfaction is commonly surveyed, but what exactly is being considered when a  
guest is satisfied, or not, with the setting and the experience? Great understanding can come  
from evaluative research that looks at perceived quality, combined with the assigned impor-  
tance and performance \(IP\) of various elements of the setting and programme. IP measures  
how each element in the venue or setting has contributed to overall satisfaction. Guests and  
customers can be quite dissatisfied with elements of the setting, service, and programme yet  
express overall satisfaction with the event.  
# Theming and Programming  
A theme is a unifying idea or concept. It can be a visual or sensory theme, in the realms of  
decorators and chefs, an activity theme \(styles of sport, play, and recreation\), a fantasy theme  
\(beloved by party planners, and usually combining decor and entertainment\), an emotional  
theme \(such as a celebration of something of value at a festival or commemoration\), or it can  
be intellectual in nature \(such as the conference topic or workshop problem\).  
Thematic interpretation\: When education is an aim, the theme should be stimulating and provoc-  
ative, embodying tangible and intangible elements. Memorable themes tap into universal belief  
systems and should provide the take-home message – the moral of the story \(Ham et al., 2005\).  
Many entertainment or decoration themes do not do that, nor is it necessarily appropriate at  
concerts, parties, and other social gatherings. Whatever goes into the event programme, from  
sensory stimulation to entertainment and spectacle, should ideally reflect and reinforce the  
theme.  
Festivals can be defined as themed, public celebrations. If it is a Mozart Festival the theme  
is fairly obvious, but there might be layers of theming – the grand, unifying theme plus sub-  
themes. Deliberately or by neglect, themes can be open to interpretation. Superficially the  
theme might be popular music, but do the attendees see it more as an opportunity for a  
sub-culture celebration involving drinking, drugs, or sex? In that case, the perceived theme  
might be completely different from the marketed theme, and an evaluation of motivations and  
meanings is needed.  
*Programme Planning and Life-Cycles*  
A programme is scheduled or scripted activities for the audience and other participants.  
A concert programme can be quite simple, consisting of the order of artists or musical pieces. A  
festival programme might be complex, involving multiple days and venues with numerous  
activities and performances. Sport events have scheduled times for competitions and award  
ceremonies. Meetings and conventions typically operate within tight agendas to make sure the  
programme of speakers, plenary and breakout sessions, meals, coffee breaks, and social events  
keep to the schedule. Often they do not, thereby requiring flexibility to be built in.  
The programme planning process usually starts with an evaluation of existing programming  
and/or new idea generation. It is generally wise to test ideas, although for planned events this 268  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
can be difficult. At a basic level, focus groups can be held to test programme ideas with poten-  
tial patrons or with stakeholder groups, and at a more costly level, mini-events can be held to  
see if the concept is feasible and satisfies target segments. This stage is equivalent to formative  
evaluation.  
Life-cycle considerations are important. Some programmes and services can be slated for a short  
life expectancy, including their planned termination, while others can be allowed to run a full  
course through growth, maturity, and decline. If sales and profits are the primary measure of  
success, a programme or service will have to be terminated, or rejuvenated through reinvest-  
ment and repositioning, when profit margins shrink. Community service and goodwill pro-  
grammes do not necessarily have to be terminated because of cost and revenue considerations,  
but their ongoing effectiveness has to be demonstrated. Sustaining traditional programmic ele-  
ments, while innovating regularly to test new ones, is a model followed by many events includ-  
ing the Calgary Stampede \(see Getz, 1993b, 1997\). At some point, changes to programming  
can be so substantial as to constitute repositioning of the event. The life-cycle concept, whether  
it is applied to programme elements or the entire life of an event, or to portfolios of events as  
they evolve, links directly to the evaluation stages called formative, process, and summative  
\(see Getz, 2018, Event Evaluation\). These are discussed again in Chapter 14.  
*Programmic Elements of Style*  
Style means a characteristic way of doing things to create a unique event or programme, excel-  
lence of artistic expression \(being a measure of product or programme quality\), or fashion  
\(which always changes\). We can say that designers have their own style, and that all events  
are stylistically different. Recall our earlier discussions of aesthetics and beauty, because style  
is largely subjective and therefore subject to widely different interpretations. Each programmic  
element of style has a creative and a technical component, and often they can be combined. Gen-  
erally, the elements have to be designed in concert with the setting and implemented through  
physical development and all the management systems.  
Some programmic elements of style are hallmarks of particular types of events. That is, the type  
of event embodies it, as in exhibitions requiring demonstrations or sales, or festivals incor-  
porating celebratory rituals. A hallmark can also be thought of as a social construct, with the  
element closely associated with a certain name or form. For example, business and trade events  
like fairs and trade shows involve commerce by nature. Festivals are celebrations, so they have  
to incorporate belonging and sharing, emotional stimulation, rituals, and symbolism. Sports  
and recreation must involve games or competitions. These constructs might vary from culture  
to culture, with sub- and counter-culture variations as well.  
Standing alone, one element of style looks bare and will generate a rather narrow range of  
experiences. Sports are packaged as festivals for a good reason, to expand their appeal and gen-  
erate additional benefits. Business events are serious, but they almost always base part of their  
appeal on social and touristic opportunities. The idea of converging forms and functions in the  
events sector reflects this point. One way to specify programmic elements of style is to list the  
actions a programmer or designer can include, or the activities that participants and guests are  
to engage in \(see Table 11.1\). These are the main activity elements subject to design, but keep  
in mind that each one can have varying cognitive and affective outcomes. Event Design\: tHeory and Principles 269

Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
*Evaluating Programme Quality*  
Getz and Carlsen \(2006, 146\) discussed the main dimensions of event quality. Quality begins  
with the organisation\: its mandate and vision, philosophy and customer orientation; the com-  
petence of its staff and volunteers; its governance, and the effectiveness of its management.  
Programme \(or product\) quality is experiential and subject to qualitative evaluation by all  
the stakeholders. Customers evaluate quality by expressing their level of satisfaction with the  
event overall, or with the quality of what is being presented to them in the form of sport com-  
petition, musical performance, speakers at a convention, art at an exhibit, food at a banquet,  
etc. Product quality can also be assessed through benchmarking against other events, the opin-  
ions of expert judges, or experiential research.  
Love and Crompton \(1996\) tested the hypothesis, based on the works of Herzberg \(1966\), that  
some event elements are ‘dissatisfiers’ which can undermine the visitor experience, while others  
are ‘satisfiers’ which provide benefits. Dissatisfiers are like Herzberg’s ‘maintenance factors’ – they  
must be provided with expected levels of quality, but in themselves do not completely satisfy  
visitors. The researchers argued that most of the physical factors at events, such as parking,  
restrooms, and information, are dissatisfiers, while ambience, fantasy, excitement, relaxation,  
escape, and social involvement are satisfiers. High-quality events must meet expectations in  
both categories, but they are non-compensatory in that a single or small number of attributes  
can determine the perception of overall quality. Tentative support for this model was con-  
firmed, and the researchers believed that certain attributes were perceived to be so poor, or  
of such high quality, that visitors disregarded or discounted other attributes in giving their  
overall appraisal. In other words, it is always important to identify the importance assigned to  
elements of the setting, programme, or service. That is the role of IP measurement.  
Baker and Crompton \(2000\) determined that generic and entertainment features of an event  
are more likely to generate increased satisfaction and motivate return visits or positive word-  
of-mouth recommendations. Saleh and Ryan \(1993\) found that the quality of the music pro-  
gramme is the most important service factor in attracting people to jazz festivals. Overall  
satisfaction levels affected the intention for repeat visits. Similarly, Thrane \(2002\) explored  
the link between satisfaction and future intentions of festival-goers. The most important con-  
clusion from his study in Norway was that event managers must try to improve programme  
quality \(in this case music\) and be concerned with other factors that shape overall satisfaction.  
Ryan and Lockyer \(2002\) studied the satisfaction levels of participants in the South Pacific  
Masters games in New Zealand – a friendly, multi-sport event for older athletes. The results  
showed that sport event managers need to pay particular attention to improving items of high  
importance but low satisfaction. In this sample the prime motivators – seeking challenge and  
fun – were found to be satisfied by the event. A factor analysis was also used to identify five  
components of importance to participants, namely, social \(social events plus meeting people\);  
registration \(efficient, with good communications\); challenge \(the competitions\); after-event  
communication; and evaluation that the event was both fun and serious.  
# Service Design and Quality  
Service in the event context is a mix of human-guest interactions \(the staff and volunteers being  
part of the experience, as well as suppliers of services\) and the various ways in which guests  
or customers get what they need in terms of essential services \(i.e., hygiene, health, and safety,  
information, rest and relaxation, food and beverages, merchandise\). There is a huge body of Event Design\: tHeory and Principles literature on service marketing, quality, and delivery, especially for the tourism and hospitality  
sectors \(see, for example, Prideaux et al., 2006\). Applied to event design, the basic principle is  
that all management systems, as well as staff and volunteer actions, directly affect the custom-  
ers’ perceptions of quality and therefore their level of satisfaction with the event experience.  
271  
*Service Blueprinting and Evaluation*  
Blueprinting is a tool with value in all services, but its application to planned events has been  
minimal. The idea is to create a map, chart, or blueprint based on the flow of intended visitor  
activities and experiences \(this was partially attempted in Figure 11.2\) and to show how the  
experiences are facilitated by the setting, all the management systems, and human contacts.  
Following implementation another map or chart can be compiled, based on evidence, showing  
what customers actually experienced and what they thought of it. This can be called a service  
map to be used as a diagnostic or evaluation tool. If there is no blueprint, which is often the  
case, then evaluative research during the event, combined with post-event feedback, can be  
highly informative and lead to improvements.  
Getz et al. \(2001\) provided two service maps to show the results of a team of nine researchers  
\(the three authors and six trained students\) who conducted an on-site evaluation of a surfing  
event in Western Australia. Triangulation was employed, including \(1\) direct observation of  
the site and audience, using standard checklists, \(2\) a visitor survey, mostly about satisfaction,  
and \(3\) logbooks based on participant observation \(i.e., researchers documenting their own  
event experiences\).  
Customer actions\: The blueprint anticipates the flow of customer actions, starting with an  
approach to the site and ending with departure. If there are many activity options or venues  
it will be necessary to have multiple blueprints or evaluative maps, some in great detail and  
one for the overall process. Although the blueprint specifies actions in settings, it should con-  
sider the intended customer or guest experience in cognitive and affective terms. For example,  
“viewing art in gallery” can be expanded into “the guest will enjoy a quiet, aesthetic experi-  
ence, aided by interactive information about the artists and their displays”. This experiential  
elaboration will greatly assist in planning the ‘physical evidence’ and staff–guest interactions.  
When doing a service mapping exercise as evaluation, multiple observers \(engaged in direct  
and participant observation\) will be needed to plot the actual flow and activities of guests and  
to summarise the experiential dimensions.  
Tangible evidence of product and service quality\: The blueprint specifies all the physical evidence  
of quality, such as entertainment, the competition, exhibits, facilities, signs, equipment, and  
audio-visual effects, and these are depicted on the diagram in the area above the customer  
actions flow chart. Include hygiene factors like toilets and soap, water, and comfort stations.  
Anticipate everything the guest will need or desire and specify the quality standards. In the  
case of evaluations, describe gaps and flaws in tangible evidence, such as crowding, unantici-  
pated behaviour, safety and health hazards, obvious customer confusion, and inadequate sig-  
nage or direction. Describe programme or product quality as experienced by observers. Hygiene  
factors have been found to be extremely important at events, not in motivating people to attend  
or affecting their assessment of overall programme quality, but in terms of causing dissatisfac-  
tion \(these include security, cleanliness, and comfort\).  
Visible staff contacts\: For each customer action, or experience setting, the blueprint has to specify  
staff or volunteer support that will, or could, involve staff–guest interaction. These also define  
potential critical incidents where service failure could occur. This line, under the customer flow 272  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
chart, also quantifies human resource needs, in terms of staffing levels, duties, and necessary  
training.  
Viewed as cast members, staff and volunteers have both technical roles to play in delivering  
essential services, and an experiential role to play in facilitating desired experiences. Their  
appearance and demeanour are important to theming as well as service. In terms of service  
marketing theory \(i.e., SERVQUAL, developed by Parasuraman et al., 1988\), staff and volun-  
teers have to exhibit ‘responsiveness’ \(willingness to help; promptness\), ‘assurance’ \(knowledge  
and courtesy; convey trust and inspire confidence\), ‘empathy’ \(caring; providing individual ser-  
vice\), and ‘reliability’ \(ability and dependability\).  
Invisible management processes\: The usual practice is to draw a line under the visible staff contacts  
and in this bottom space on the blueprint to indicate the management systems that have to  
be in place to support the entire service process \(which, at events, inevitably means the pro-  
gramme as well\). In evaluations, the observers can work backwards from obvious failures or  
problems to determine what was missing or flawed in these hidden systems \(e.g., police should  
have regulated the approach road\).  
*Gaps Analysis*  
A standard planning and evaluation tool in services management is the five-gaps model \(Para-  
suraman et al., 1988\). It directs attention to potential problems that could lead to customer  
dissatisfaction or disinterest in the event. Each gap can be the subject of internal scrutiny or  
research with customers. Here are event-related examples.  
Gap 1\: The event owners/designers/producers have not done adequate market research,  
or have failed to evaluate past performance, so they do not know what customers want or  
expect \(maybe they think they do!\).  
Gap 2\: Management systems do not lead to high levels of service quality or the right pro-  
gramme to satisfy customers. Standards are low, or specifications incomplete. Again, this is  
a failure of research and evaluation, but there could be other reasons such as inexperience.  
Gap 3\: All the planning and design were good, but the workers do not deliver. Training  
might have been inadequate, or on-site conditions prevented them from adhering to stan-  
dards. Motivation might have been low on the day of the event.  
Gap 4\: Promises were made but not kept. Marketing and communications exaggerated the  
actual level of service to be provided or the nature and quality of the programme \(in some  
cases this might be deliberate, which makes it fraudulent\).  
Gap 5\: as a result of the above gaps, guests arrive expecting a high level of service and a  
specific kind of programme but perceive it to be low to mediocre. They might complain,  
or simply go home with a bad impression. Were their expectations wrong, or was service  
delivery at fault? Should communications have been clearer? What exactly gave rise to their  
expectations? This is the classic expectation-confirmation scenario.  
*IP Measurement*  
It is one thing to know how satisfied a guest is, another to understand what exactly was import-  
ant to their decision to attend, or most importantly their overall satisfaction with the event.  
Satisfaction usually links to future behaviour such as word-of-mouth recommendations and  
repeat visits. The IP technique is quite versatile and generates numeric scores and graphics Event Design\: tHeory and Principles IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE GRAPH FOR 11 ATTRIBUTES

that are fairly easy to interpret and communicate. For example, those attending music concerts  
can usually be expected to give a high score to the quality and reputation of performers as  
motivators for attending, and as the main sources of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Ideally, the  
manager wants to find out that they performed very well in providing the entertainment that  
consumers valued the most. You do not want to find out that toilets were ranked “very poor”  
and provided a great source of dissatisfaction.  
Figure 11.5 provides an example, showing how respondents’ scores \(usually from a five or  
­ seven-point Likert scale, then aggregated\) are plotted on a grid displaying increasing impor-  
tance on the vertical and increasing performance \(e.g., satisfaction\) on the horizontal. Some-  
times the four cells are determined by plotting mean scores from all respondents \(i.e., the  
grand mean\), but that might not be a fine enough differentiation, so an alternative is shown  
that is based on quartiles. The purpose is to reveal priorities for action, so the top-right cell,  
often labelled “Keep up the good work”, should be kept small. Analysts can make it appear that  
the event is doing great by making that quadrant big, but keep in mind that many respondents  
will be reluctant to assign low ratings. Carefully examine the distribution of scores before  
deciding on the grid lines.  
Two general applications of IP should be considered. The first is to ask potential customers  
what motivates them, or what they expect, and present to them a range of attributes related to  
programme and service quality. The researcher might find the event was going to spend a lot  
of money and effort on services or programme elements that would not result in high levels  
of satisfaction. Or the opposite. As an on-site or post-event evaluation tool, IP should address  
perceptions of the experience, again by presenting attributes of service and programme to see 274  
Event Design\: tHeory and Principles  
what exactly was responsible for satisfaction and dissatisfaction. One possible result is that  
guests were satisfied overall, even though some elements of service and programme were per-  
ceived to be poor \(but were less important\). In constructing the list of attributes or features  
to be evaluated by research, it will always be wise to conduct preliminary tests through such  
methods as focus groups and interviews.  
STUDY GUIDE  
Students should start with an appreciation that design is both a technical and creative process  
to meet goals and solve problems. Event design has most often been associated with the form,  
that is, the physical production of events, but has evolved to encompass experience design  
and strategic design for value creation networks \(e.g., portfolios\). Experiences are highly per-  
sonal and therefore cannot be prescribed or guaranteed, so event producers and designers  
must do their best to specify intended experiences and to anticipate the motives, needs, and  
desired experiences of all the stakeholders. In terms of the concept of service-dominant logic,  
experiences are co-created through interactions\: designers, producers, guests, the setting, and  
services. Programme and service quality are major factors in engaging and satisfying the par-  
ticipants or customers.  
The ensuing study questions address all the learning objectives and provide structure for  
studying the contents of this chapter. Take particular note of the various theories that inform  
event design, as well as the models and methods that can be used by designers, including in

# Introduction  
Why do people attend events? There are myriad reasons, with both demand and supply factors  
influencing choices. Event-related behaviour is complex, but there are theoretical perspectives  
that will help us understand the process and apply this knowledge to all planned events.  
Antecedents are all those influences that shape knowledge of, interest in, and actual event atten-  
dance or participation. We start with needs, which are closely linked to intrinsic \(self-directed\)  
and extrinsic \(from outside\) motivation. A discussion of demand takes us from social psychology to  
economics, then we draw upon consumer research to explore decision-making. Leisure theory  
provides a solid base for examining barriers and constraints, and how people overcome or  
negotiate through them to achieve their goals.  
Part two of this chapter follows the premise that marketing and communications should follow  
from a deep understanding of the antecedents to event attendance and participation. Basic  
marketing theory is presented, including the traditional marketing mix, but with an emphasis  
on how experiential marketing and service-dominant logic are influencing the events sector.  
Market segmentation specific to events is highlighted. In addition to introducing the traditional  
communications mix, new media, and the digital economy are featured. Attention is given to  
how social media are both communication tools and the means for interest groups to shape  
and even create events. The expert opinion by Barbara Mazza elaborates on communications  
trends.  
# Antecedents  
To start the discussion, a conceptual model of the main factors shaping participation in, or  
attendance at, planned events is presented \(Figure 12.1\). This framework is designed as a pro-  
cess, and it is not predictive. It shows all the main factors we need to understand and suggests  
how they interconnect, but it is not possible to forecast that any particular set of antecedents  
will result in certain decisions, or that experiences lead to predictable future behaviour. Each of  
the main elements is discussed in sequence, starting with personality.  
The model follows, in part, the work of Benckendorff and Pearce \(2012\) who developed a very  
useful framework for applying psychological theory to event participation. They considered  
pre-event, on-site, and post-event experiences, for spectators, attendees, performers, and elite  
participants. They stressed that psychological theory on personality, motivation, and involve-  
ment is important when looking at antecedents, while role theory, identity, liminality, flow,  
mindfulness, emotional and performative labour, and experience analysis can be applied to the  
event experience itself. Satisfaction, loyalty, self-actualisation, and personal development apply  
after an event experience.  
*Personality*  
Personality, values, attitudes, and lifestyle preferences are the psychological factors that lie at  
the foundation of human behaviour. Individuals will show a propensity for certain behaviour  
as a result of these factors, but that does not necessarily mean they will act, or act consistently  
on them. Some people have a higher propensity to seek novelty or take risks. In the terminol-  
ogy of Stanley Plog \(1987\), there are more adventuresome types who seek out unique leisure and  
travel experiences. Others have a greater need for consistency and therefore a higher tolerance  
of boredom. According to the theory of personality-environment congruence, extroverted risk-takers  
will be happy at raucous concerts, but shy introverts will not. Events often cater to certain 278

personality types without the organisers being aware. It should be emphasised, however, that  
people do not always adhere to generalisations like this. Personality types will not be the only  
influence on choices.  
Another theory of relevance is that of ‘optimal challenge’, which suggests that in event program-  
ming the matching of challenges with participants’ skills will likely produce the desired ‘flow’  
experience. Csikszentmihalyi \(1975, 1990\) described flow as a state of absorption character-  
ised by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, being neither bored nor overwhelmed,  
and feeling that time is flying. This kind of experience is intrinsically rewarding, meaning  
that it is valued in itself, and not for what it can do. Being able to experience flow might very  
well help people accomplish their goals. Csikszentmihalyi also concluded that boredom results  
when challenges are too low, that anxiety stems from challenges that are too great, and this has  
implications for anyone pursuing self-development.  
*Values and Attitudes*  
Values are subjective reactions to, and assessments about, the world. They are deeply held, and in  
behavioural terms, they imply a conscious assessment of the desirability of alternative behaviours,  
including what is right and wrong. They are personal and can evolve. Norms, in this context, are  
patterns of acceptable or desired behaviour, with reference to either society as a whole, or refer-  
ence groups such as peers, family, religion, or other affiliations. They help shape values.  
Values are shaped by experience, religious or political affiliations, general social and cultural  
influences \(e.g., norms\), and perhaps by personality. Do you value freedom of choice? Having Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications decisions made for you by the government? Environmental responsibility? How are your  
personal values different from the important people in your life? And do your values shape your  
interest in events or tourism? There can be substantial differences in event-related choices and  
behaviour that can be traced back to core values, for example, some events being considered  
contemptible, others being recommended by influencers. These and many other descriptive  
terms are value-laden and therefore contested.  
Allport \(1937\) provided the classic definition of attitude as a “learned predisposition to respond to  
an object or class of objects in a consistently favorable or unfavorable way”  
.  
Attitudes are theorised to contain conative \(action and behavioural intention\), affective  
\(evaluation and affect, or emotion\), and cognitive \(perception and belief\) components.  
Note that this trilogy is also used, in a slightly different way, to describe the dimensions of  
experience.  
Within the context of the “theory of planned behaviour” \(Ajzen, 1991\), researchers have examined  
attitudes towards leisure participation. Many other factors influence actual behaviour, but mea-  
suring attitudes can be a good predictor if the attitude is linked to a specific behaviour, such  
as “How likely are you to attend a rock concert/cultural festival/art exhibition in the next 12  
months?”, as opposed to general behaviour \(such as “How do you feel about attending special  
events?”\). What are the influences shaping attitudes towards planned events? Some combi-  
nation of personal, social, and cultural factors lies at the base of beliefs and predispositions.  
Lifestyles, as unique patterns of thinking and behaving, arise from personality, values, and atti-  
tudes. Some researchers refer to these factors as psychographics. According to Decrop \(2006,  
11\), lifestyles reflect the ‘self-concept’ of people. Although seldom explored in the context of  
planned events, as opposed to leisure and travel in general, there are identifiable lifestyles that  
predispose or facilitate participation in events. If it is accepted that many people value experi-  
ences more than objects and consumables so that \(for example\) foodies and food tourists are  
willing – and often eager – to pay for rewarding and novel experiences, then consumption of  
experiences must hold symbolic value. Consistent patterns of symbolic consumption gener-  
ate and help define discernible lifestyles. In the foodie lifestyle examined by Getz et al. \(2014,  
2015\), events figure prominently in shaping and reinforcing identity, with some specialised  
events holding high symbolic value and therefore becoming iconic to those with a special inter-  
est in food.  
Basing lifestyle segmentation on personality and values has become controversial, with some  
contemporary theorists taking a more nuanced look at underlying meanings and culture-based  
value systems. This perspective links to Bourdeiu \(1986\) and cultural capital. Furthermore, the  
term lifestyle has a number of possible connotations, including the view that a healthy or moral  
lifestyle is highly desirable \(such as being environmentally and socially responsible\), or that  
some people have enviable or lamentable lifestyles \(e.g., lifestyles of the rich and famous\). In  
this context, being a foodie, or demonstrating any other form of lifestyle through leisure and  
travel, might attract criticism. That is why lifestyle cannot be separated from values and norms.  
279  
*Needs and Preferences*  
According to Maslow \(1954, 1968\), needs are both physiological \(what we need to exist and be  
safe\) and socially learned \(what we feel we need in order to belong and be happy\). The follow-  
ing four were said to be deficit needs, and people instinctively seek to meet them. In times of  
stress regression can occur, but Maslow believed people normally move from the lower to the  
higher-order needs in a developmental process\: 280  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
l Physiological\: survival needs, including water, food, and shelter;  
l Safety and security needs\: stability, order, protection, structure;  
l Love and belonging needs\: social needs, a wish for affection and to show affection, a sense of  
community;  
l Esteem needs\: hierarchical, with the lower order consisting of respect for others, status, and  
recognition; higher order – self-respect, competence and independence, achievement, and  
mastery.  
Others have argued that there are additional needs, and that the hierarchical nature of  
Maslow’s theory is unsupportable. However controversial, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has  
been influential, and is referenced again in our discussion of motivation. Needs get translated  
into wants, and some of these become economic demands for goods, services, and experi-  
ences. Needs can therefor activate behaviour \(Mannell and Kleiber, 1997\), and this gives rise  
to expectation-confirmation theory.  
Self-actualisation and peak experiences  
Maslow’s hierarchy is often shown as a pyramid with ‘self-actualization’ at the top. Maslow  
believed that certain people, only 2% of the population, could be called ‘self-actualized’, and they  
have many more ‘peak experiences’ than others. A ‘peak experience’ is available to all, and self-ac-  
tualisation is ‘growth motivation’, or a process of seeking.  
Peak experiences were described by Maslow as sudden feelings of intense happiness and well-being.  
They are non- religious, quasi-mystical, or mystical in nature, and possibly accompanied  
by awareness of ‘ultimate truth’ and the unity of all things. Also accompanying peak experi-  
ences is a heightened sense of control over the body and emotions, and a wider sense of aware-  
ness. The experience fills the individual with wonder and awe. Maslow also described peak  
experiences as self-validating, self-justifying moments with their own intrinsic value. They are  
never negative, unpleasant, or evil. They result in being disoriented in time and space, and this  
very much sounds like the liminal/liminoid zone of Turner, as well as Csikszentimihalyi’s ‘flow’.  
These experiences are said to be accompanied by a loss of fear, anxiety, doubts, and inhibitions.  
While these concepts have appeal, and can be applied to event experience design, critics  
argue that anybody, whether good or evil, could have peak experiences. Furthermore, it can  
be argued that, despite Maslow’s beliefs, his views on self-actualisation and peak experiences  
have no moral basis. In other words, self-actualising people are not superior in any way.  
Others find these notions to be unscientific and untestable, even though they have some  
intuitive appeal.  
Benefits are what people believe they will obtain from consumption or participation, and these  
are generally expressed in terms related to need fulfilment. For example, of all the benefits  
provided by leisure services and sport, improved health is at or near the top of the lists made  
by proponents of sport and sport events. People want many things or experiences, but that is  
not necessarily the same as needing them. Only the individual can decide when a want becomes  
a need, although society often makes judgements as to what is a basic need and governments  
implement this through their social welfare and health policies. If governments create or sub-  
sidise events, it can be considered to reflect an ideology that sees social and cultural gatherings  
as a need. Also consider that potential substitution comes into play, because many needs and  
wants can be met through different outlets. We do not need to go to a particular event unless it  
is forced on us \(being an extrinsic motivator\). Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications 281  
Do people need events?  
The answer is yes, in a way. People might not respond to questions by saying they need to  
attend a party or cultural celebration, but they do need the socialising, relaxation, or escapism  
that events offer. People need to discover, learn and fulfil their aesthetic ambitions, and attend-  
ing events provides these benefits. Companies have to market and do business, so they need  
exhibitions and consumer shows. Associations have to meet. Humans need to recreate, leading  
to sport events. Events of all kinds have been successful because they help meet so many fun-  
damental personal, social, cultural, and economic needs.  
Several questions get to the core of the issue. If a popular festival is cancelled, will a new one  
emerge to take its place? This has happened many times, with popular demand resulting in  
replacements. Of recent relevance because of the pandemic are these questions\: if all festi-  
vals, meetings, conventions, participation, and spectator sport events are cancelled, is there  
high enough demand to bring them back as soon as possible? The pandemic did answer these  
questions, revealing a very strong need for events within both the business and leisure worlds.  
*Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation*  
Personality traits may have a rather permanent influence on behaviour, whereas motivation is  
dynamic – it can and does change. Motivation refers to the process by which people are driven  
to act in a certain way \(Decrop, 2006, 9\). Iso-Ahola \(1980, 1983\) took a more comprehen-  
sive approach in saying that motivations are internal factors that arouse, direct, and integrate  
behaviour. Another way to look at motivation is to think of a need which is accompanied by an  
expectation that action \(such as attending an event\) will satisfy it. If the expectation is met, sat-  
isfaction results. The experience of, or failure to attain satisfaction, influences future behaviour  
\(i.e., there is a feedback mechanism\).  
Motives, by contrast, are specific reasons for doing something, and they have to follow underly-  
ing needs and motivations. For example, people who are highly involved in a sport or lifestyle  
pursuit, like distance running, possess an underlying motivation to attend events where their  
specific needs can be satisfied. But their motives for deciding to attend a specific event might  
include consideration of who else is attending, the entertainment opportunities, costs, attrac-  
tiveness of the location, and the event’s reputation.  
These important definitions are taken from the Dictionary of Event Studies, Event Management and  
Event Tourism \(Getz, 2021, 169, 122\)\:  
Intrinsic Motivation\: “Motivation from within, such as the pursuit of fun, happiness and personal devel-  
opment; motivation to attend events or travel to fulfil basic needs or higher-order needs like esteem and  
self-actualisation”  
.  
Extrinsic Motivation\: “...based on external rewards, incentives or fear; this describes attending an event  
or taking a trip because someone else wants or demands it, or it is perceived to offer financial or career  
advantages”  
.  
The terms can also be applied to values, or how people value events \(see the book, The Value of  
Events, Lundberg et al., 2017, 6–7\).  
In the tourism literature, the terms push factors or drivers, and pull factors or attraction/attractive-  
ness are often used to cover travel motivation \(Crompton, 1979; Dann, 1977, 1981\). When  
we speak of the interaction of push and pull factors, Iso-Ahola’s \(1980, 1983; Mannell and  
Iso-Ahola, 1987\) seeking and escaping theory comes to the fore. Seeking and escaping motivation 282  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
simultaneously influences our decisions because we are both seeking to find personal and  
interpersonal rewards and hoping to escape aspects of personal and interpersonal environ-  
ments that bother us. Both seeking and escaping are usually forms of intrinsic motivation, or  
what we want to do for its own sake. In escaping our everyday environment, we seek change  
and novelty, especially new experiences. Under- or over-arousal gives rise to this need for escape,  
but of course, we also have to seek out something to alter our arousal levels – hence the need  
for optimal arousal at events.  
Motivational studies have been frequent in the events literature \(e.g., Backman et al., 1995;  
Crompton and McKay, 1997; Formica and Murrmann, 1998; Formica and Uysal, 1998; Funk  
et al., 2007; Green and Chalip, 1998; Leibold and van Zyl, 1994; McGehee et al., 2003; Mohr  
et al., 1993; Ngamsom and Beck, 2000; Nicholson and Pearce, 2001; Nogawa et al., 1996;  
Oppermann and Chon, 1997; Pitts, 1999; Raybould, 1998; Ryan and Trauer, 2005; Scott, 1996;  
Uysal et al., 1993; Xiao and Smith, 2004\). There have been a number of relevant review arti-  
cles\: Lee et al. \(2004\); Gibson \(2004\); Li and Petrick \(2006\); Maeng et al. \(2016\); Pilcher and  
Eade \(2016\), and Jaimangal-Jones et al. \(2018\).  
Li and Petrick \(2006\) found that most such studies were theoretically grounded in, and  
gave support to, the seeking-escaping motivation theory, and the similar push/pull model.  
Benckendorff and Pearce \(2012\) reviewed motivational studies, with an emphasis on sport  
spectators and attendees. Mair \(2013\) has reviewed the motivational studies conducted on  
convention attendees. Maeng et al. \(2016\) argued that motivational factors used extensively  
in the event literature have largely been drawn from tourism studies \(the most commonly  
researched were socialisation, family togetherness, escape, novelty, excitement, and cultural  
exploration\) and therefore more appropriate factors should be developed.  
*Personal and Interpersonal Factors*  
Sport, entertainment, and business events are an integral part of many cultures. A person’s  
cultural background can have a profound influence on their perceptions of the need for, or their  
interest in, certain types of planned events. In some societies individuals are encouraged to  
think in terms of hedonistic consumption, leading to event consumption, but in others, the col-  
lective will or religious/political doctrine generates a quite different pattern of socially accept-  
able behaviour. There are many common reasons for attending cultural celebrations, including  
entertainment, spectacle, and social, but we also need to focus on the cultural antecedents.  
For traditional events, people are expected to participate, and even to organise them because of  
the cultural norms existing in their communities. Social obligation can impact attendance and  
direct participation in cultural celebrations. Some take on the status of institutions, thereby  
attracting volunteers who gain prestige or social standing. Buying tickets to some arts festivals  
might be considered the thing to do if one is in the higher social classes, while travelling to the  
annual Wagnerian opera festival in Bayreuth, Germany, might be considered both a pilgrimage  
and a chance to meet the European elite. Peers are an especially important element in events  
that have subcultural dimensions, including cultural celebrations and sports.  
Culture is neither uniform nor static, even within single countries or cities. A postmodern-  
ist view of culture and its influence on consumption and marketing led to the development  
of a group of theories and research methodologies known as ‘consumer culture theory’  
. One of  
the major themes in this growing body of theory and practice relates to consumer identity.  
According to Rokka \(2021\), “This includes investigations into how consumers – as active rather than  
passive market actors – integrate and enact various cultural resources, including brands’ symbols, myths, and Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications ideologies into their own identity work in negotiating a sense of self and narratives of meaningful identity  
283  
goals”  
.  
Identity can be related to gender, ethnicity, and many other variables. Following Holt and  
Thompson \(2004\), one manifestation of this line of theory building has been a growing inter-  
est in storytelling and myth-making directed at connecting brands with personal identities.  
Another line of theory building concerns marketplace cultures where the co-creation of expe-  
riences is the norm.  
The terms brand community, consumer tribes, sub-cultures, online communities, and co-created market  
practices emerge from this perspective. One result can be the formation of shared identities so  
that special interest travel such as the dedicated sport tourist \(i.e., distance runners and their  
iconic events\) is a closely related concept. The emergence of so-called influencers is relevant  
here, including the question of how and why people consult others or follow their lead when  
making brand or individual consumption decisions.  
*Expectations*  
Needs and motives give rise to expectations that certain behaviours will yield desired ben-  
efits, and this is the essence of the theory of planned behaviour. Expectations are also shaped  
by communications \(advertising and image-making\) on the part of events, particularly by  
word-of-mouth recommendations or expressed opinions from valued reference groups. The  
event travel career trajectory \(ETCT\) is also applicable, as the more experience one has with  
events \(either particular events or events in general\), the more it will likely affect expecta-  
tions. Expectation-Confirmation Theory is widely used, as in SERVQUAL, to examine satisfac-  
tion. Customers compare their expectations with actual experiences or services provided when  
determining their level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. A person can attend an event with  
no specific expectations, presumably because it is a new or unique experience, but there will  
always be generic knowledge and experiences that give rise to some expectations.  
# Motivation and Motives for Attending Different Types of Events  
Many event motivation studies have examined festivals. Probably the most important conclu-  
sion is that generic motivation predominates \(i.e., family togetherness, socialising, group iden-  
tity, all related to underlying need fulfilment\), while event-specific motives \(the programme, the  
art form, and uniqueness features\) are likely to be important to niche segments and relatively  
more important for tourists. We can say that festival motivators are primarily intrinsic, that is,  
for leisure and other personally/socially rewarding reasons, whereas for other types of events,  
extrinsic motivators might apply \(e.g., for work and business\).  
Numerous studies have delineated these motivational factors, suggesting that a core set of  
drivers for festival attendance exists, including cultural enrichment, education, novelty, and  
socialisation \(Crompton and McKay, 1997, 429\). These pull factors should be considered  
alongside having fun \(or hedonism\) as generic reasons for leisure and travel to events, with the  
proviso that both seeking and escaping motives are often coincidental. Escaping from boredom  
and stressful environments is often just as powerful a motivator as the specific attractiveness  
of events.  
The importance of socialising has been highlighted by Nordvall et al. \(2014\). Socialising can  
be in the form of family togetherness, having fun with peers, meeting like-minded people  
who have met online, or just being part of a crowd. Uysal and Li \(2008\) presented a critical 284  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
literature review of empirical studies of festival and event motivation. They identified that the  
most frequently mentioned dimension was socialisation \(24.0%\), followed by family together-  
ness \(18.8%\), novelty \(19.0%\), and escape \(15.7%\). The other major dimensions were cultural  
exploration \(5.0%\), entertainment \(5.8%\), and attractions \(4.1%\).  
The key role of social factors was also identified by Foster and Robinson \(2010\) focusing on  
the motivational factors that influence event attendance in family groups. The study of fam-  
ilies with children confirmed the overriding importance of family togetherness, followed by  
socialising, and excitement in motivating family attendance at special events. The study con-  
cluded that families are willing to compromise on individual motivation and attend events that  
children will find satisfying. Families were not interested in novelty or uniqueness, they just  
wanted to spend time together.  
In Figure 12.2, the generic and event-specific motivators, that is, the experiences desired, are  
combined with essential services to provide a model of utility to event designers and market-  
ers. The essential services can be called ‘hygiene factors’ or ‘dissatisfiers’ \(after Herzberg, 1966\)  
because they do not motivate, yet they can dissatisfy customers. Generic benefits attract the  
widest possible audiences but are also highly substitutable. Event-specific experiences, or the  
benefits offered, will attract those seeking something special such as unique, one-time-only, and  
high-quality programming. The highly involved are motivated by experiences they can share  
with others in their social worlds. A mix of generic and targeted benefits, built on a foundation  
of high-quality service, is essential for events to compete with other events and other forms of  
entertainment, and especially to attract tourists.  
There are many types of festivals, so event-specific motivators always have to be considered.  
Perhaps the most challenging type is that of the so-called community festival, which often  
means a multi-purpose event intended to appeal to the widest possible audience. While such  
festivals tend to celebrate the community itself, or have the aim of social integration, they  
might also contain programmic elements that are designed to attract tourists \(especially  
ESSENTIAL SERVICES \(or hygiene factors\)

\* communicaons \* informaon \*food and beverages

Figure 12.2 Generic and Event-Specific Motivators and Motives Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications entertainment and participatory sports\). Usually, they are organised and/or supported by the  
local government but might be managed by a not-for-profit society or a consortium of local  
organisations. Jepson and Clarke \(2014\) and Jepson et al. \(2013\) explored the community  
festival from the perspective of social inclusion and power relations. Báez-Montenegro and  
Devesa-Fernández \(2017\) pointed to festival tourism focussed on an interest in cinema, with  
film festivals attracting aficionados – an observation that reflects both social world and travel  
career perspectives. And, as reflected in research by Podestà and Richards \(2018\) many such  
arts or creative-industry festivals have become knowledge hubs, a fact that expands their tra-  
ditional roles and appeal.  
285  
*Business Events*  
We should expect that the motivations to attend meetings and business-related events will be  
quite different from leisure motivations, specifically that extrinsic motives will often dominate\:  
being required to attend \(lack of choice\); seeking a reward for attending \(learning something  
useful, developing a personal or business network\), and a mix of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards  
\(i.e., combining business with pleasure\). Business event organisers often stress the social pro-  
gramme as well as pre- and post-event tours.  
Oppermann and Chon \(1997\) produced a decision-making model for attendees, and subsequent  
work has expanded our understanding of motives, constraints, and choices. Severt et al. \(2007\)  
examined convention-attendee motivations and identified these\: activities and opportunities;  
networking; the convenience of the location; educational benefits, and products and deals. Mair  
and Thompson \(2009\) identified two critical factors affecting the decision to attend, namely,  
networking opportunities and costs. In a review article, Elston and Draper \(2012\) reported that  
total costs to the attendee were consistently reported to be the main criteria being considered  
by meeting planners, but they suggested that sustainability and technology should be given  
more attention by researchers. Mair \(2013\) reviewed the literature on convention motivation,  
observing that the main topics explored by researchers were the desire for networking and  
professional development/education. Constraining factors included cost, timing, accessibility,  
location attractiveness, and health or safety concerns.  
Jung and Tanford \(2017\) conducted a meta-analysis of the convention literature and deter-  
mined that networking and education are the top contributors to attendee satisfaction, and  
these generate repeat attendance. However, Kim and Malek \(2017\) found that motivations to  
attend a medical conference were somewhat different from other business events, with pro-  
gramming and location being the most critical, so a more nuanced approach is needed when  
examining motivation.  
Exhibition motivations have been examined by Yi et al. \(2018\) and Fu et al. \(2019\). Exhibi-  
tions have to attract exhibitors, and they are primarily motivated by business factors, whereas  
other attendees will be looking for information, contacts, new ideas, and perhaps a good time.  
Fu et al. \(2019\) emphasised knowledge, social networking, and leisure motivations which  
made exhibitions places of both service and experience. Consumer-show motivations have  
been studied by Fox and Edwards \(2009\) and Rittichainuwat and Mair \(2012\). While these  
are very diverse in theme, covering such topics as lifestyle, health, leisure, and vehicles, a com-  
mon motivator is to learn and compare, and sometimes to purchase. It can be expected that  
people with special interests are focusing on shows that cater to their social world or leisure  
preferences. 286  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
*Sport Fans and Spectators*  
In applying psychological ideas to sport event participation, Benckendorff and Pearce \(2012,  
166\) distinguished between spectators and attendees, performers and participants, and elite  
participants. Fans were considered to be a special segment. Personality, role theory, involve-  
ment, motivation, and the actual experience plus post-experience are important consider-  
ations. Identity theory suggests that people attend sport and other types of events that carry  
symbolic significance, thereby helping to define themselves. Li and Petrick’s \(2006\) literature  
review related to sports resulted in several important conclusions. First, a general motivation  
scale for sport event attendance by fans or spectators has been developed and widely applied  
\(see Wann, 1995; Wann et al., 1999\). Second, studying potential attendees adds to our under-  
standing \(as opposed to surveys of actual attendees\), and third, travel and event motivation  
might be different – a finding of significance for sport tourism \(also see Bodet, 2015; Parent  
and Chappelet, 2015\).  
*Sport Participation*  
A key motivator of amateur participation and sport tourism is challenging oneself through  
physical activity. Other forms of self-development through sport relate to health \(e.g., weight  
loss, strength conditioning\). Generic reasons include accompanying family members \(espe-  
cially for youth sports\) and the communitas that come from belonging to specific interest  
groups. Prayag and Grivel \(2018\) summarised motives for sport participation, noting they have  
been extensively studied but categorised in different ways – making comparison and replica-  
tion difficult. The combined evidence from many studies points to these important motiva-  
tions\: escape; socialising or meeting affiliation needs; hedonism, such as fun and thrill-seeking;  
skill development and achievement; learning or exploration, covering both the sport and the  
destination.  
# Barriers and Constraints  
All the antecedents we have considered act together to shape a person’s desire and propensity  
for certain event experiences, but there are often constraints on our actions, especially time  
and money, and specific barriers to overcome. The next section deals with leisure constraint theory  
applied to events.  
*Leisure Constraints Theory*  
Why do some people not participate in events? This question is vital in marketing, but there  
are also important theoretical considerations that get to the nature of motivation, benefits,  
and the nature of the event experience. In Event Studies, the challenge is to not only identify  
constraints on attendance but to examine how people overcome constraints to attend, and  
how that knowledge might affect both event planning and marketing. In the context of serious  
leisure or frequent event participation by high-involvement segments, we should be studying how  
constraints are negotiated over a lifetime. Crawford et al. \(1991\) identified three general cate-  
gories of constraints to leisure participation\: ‘structural’, ‘personal’, and ‘interpersonal’  
. They are  
not necessarily hierarchical and might be interactive. Figure 12.3 provides examples of each  
from the point of view of a potential attendee or participant. Some of them sound like excuses,  
but excuses can have real consequences. Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications 287

Figure 12.3 Constraints on Event Participation and Attendance  
*Source\:* Adapted from Crawford et al. \(1991\) and Lee and Palakurthi \(2013\)  
Note that a different set of constraints will apply to extrinsically motivated travel or event  
­ attendance. For example, “It doesn’t interest me” could become “It won’t benefit me” in the con-  
text of a meeting or convention. “It’s too expensive” might become “The company won’t pay”.  
Structural constraints  
The first and foremost of these is accessibility, which stems from the location and timing of  
events of all kinds – they are not always available, convenient, or known by all potential partic-  
ipants. All aspects of supply analysis come into play here, as do marketing and communication.  
For example, it has long been observed that there is a huge gap between tourists’ interest in  
attending cultural events in other countries and actual participation. Why? Because they have  
imperfect knowledge of what’s available and are most likely to be in an area where the desired  
event experiences are not available. This is also why we are so interested in the ‘dedicated event  
tourist’ who travels specifically because of events.  
Time and cost are always structural constraints. On the one hand, we need to identify who is  
left out of the arts, sports, or any other type of event because they are unable to afford it, or can-  
not make the necessary time. On the other hand, “not enough time or money” are convenient  
excuses, and might often mean the person does not assign any priority to a given opportunity.  
The first is a constraint issue, the second pertains more to preferences.  
Age and health are obvious factors to consider. In youth, we cannot get about on our own,  
and until we have a disposable income we cannot do what we want. With advancing age and  
declining health \(or at least specific health problems\) interest and participation in many leisure  
and work-related events will decline. For events, there is a need to combine both life-cycle and  
work/career evolutionary approaches. 288  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
Personal constraints  
These are individual psychological conditions, including personality and moods, that hold us  
back from participating. Some people are predisposed to social activities, others to introver-  
sion. Sometimes we want to mix, at other times we need to be left alone. This category is  
similar to our earlier discussion of personality, values, attitudes, and lifestyle. Risk perception  
and risk tolerance enter into many leisure and travel decisions. Do we want to have a thrill if  
it means assuming personal risks, or can we afford to spend time and money on an event that  
might not satisfy us? How preferences are first formed for events or event experiences has  
not been researched, but for ongoing participation, there are explanations within the interre-  
lated concepts of ‘serious leisure’ \(Bendle and Patterson, 2008; Hallmann et al., 2023; Lee et al.,  
2023; Stebbins, 1982, 1992, 2006\), ‘recreation specialization’ \(Andersson and Getz, 2020; Bryan,  
1977; Lamont and Jenkins, 2013\), and ‘ego, or leisure involvement’ \(Getz and Andersson, 2010;  
Getz and McConnell, 2014; Havitz and Dimanche, 1999; Robinson and Getz, 2016; Ryan and  
Lockyer, 2002\).  
Interpersonal constraints  
These constraints arise within social contexts, taking into account the influence of others.  
This might take the form of letting significant others make decisions for us, being influenced  
by peer pressure \(e.g., fear of ridicule\), or being subjected to discrimination. Social isolation  
is often a limitation, especially for certain types of events – after all, who wants to go to a  
party or celebration alone? On the other hand, events are often great places to meet people.  
More research on why people do not attend events is necessary, such as reported by Miller  
et al. \(2004\) and Lee and Palakurthi \(2013\). Also see Mirehie et al. \(2017\) and Mahadevan  
\(2018b\).  
*Constraint Negotiation*  
As constraints almost always exist, how do people who attend and participate in events over-  
come them? ‘Negotiation’ of constraints is the individual process of finding ways to do what we  
want to do. If we really want to attend a concert, how do we get the money, make the time, find  
someone to go with, and book the tickets? The seminal study in the field was by Jackson et al.  
\(1993\), who discussed generic strategies for negotiating constraints. What Jackson et al. found  
was that people have to strike a balance between constraints and their motivations to partici-  
pate. Negotiating these barriers or constraints and balancing them with motivation results in  
different strategies being employed.  
Cognitive strategies are the internal, psychological ways we deal with constraints. For example,  
the theory of cognitive dissonance can be applied, by suggesting that if we cannot attend a concert  
because of high costs, we will devalue the artist or type of music and do something else that we  
perceive to provide equal benefits. In this sense, when people say they do not like certain types  
of events, they might mean they cannot afford them. We all want to feel good about the choices  
we make, even if they are influenced by constraints.  
Behavioural strategies include better time management, learning new skills, earning more money,  
or modifying our routines in order to do what we want to do. Some people turn leisure into  
work, or vice versa. For serious leisure, one generally has to acquire knowledge to get the  
most out of the experience, and this applies to many volunteers at events. In order to think of Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications ­ oneself as an expert or connoisseur, say for the purpose of getting the most from a wine festival,  
advanced wine knowledge is useful. Time management is something we all try to improve, par-  
ticularly in an age when a majority of people complain about time pressures or lack of time to  
get active. Multi-tasking \(or pluriactivity\) is the norm for most students, working people, and  
homemakers. Mannell and Zuzanek \(1991\) reported that even retired seniors felt that a lack  
of time was a serious leisure constraint. Setting priorities is the key. Generally, when respon-  
dents to a survey say they did not do something because of time or money constraints, they  
are probably truthful in a general sense. But this common response might very well be hiding  
a conscious or subconscious prioritisation, so they really mean “Attending the event is not high  
enough on my current list of priorities to justify making the effort or paying the price”. So, the  
researcher will have to dig deeper.  
It seems paradoxical, but the most constrained people are sometimes the most active! How do  
they manage to engage in preferred leisure pursuits when others give up? The fact is, many  
people find innovative ways to overcome or negotiate through constraints \(see Hinch et al.,  
2006, for a discussion and references\).

# Consumer Decision-Making  
Negotiation of constraints is both an antecedent and a key part of specific decision-making pro-  
cesses. We also need to study how people search for and use information, especially because  
events are very time-sensitive opportunities. Also, in the context of economic demand for  
events, we have to consider their attractiveness, the possibility of substitute experiences  
\(including competition\), and whether or not people are loyal to certain events.  
A fairly recent development in consumer decision-making is the influencer, an online personal-  
ity with some authority, expertise, or perceived relationships with social media followers. Usu-  
ally, the influencer deals with niche markets, which could be sun destinations, entertainment  
shows, festivals, or sport events. They might receive benefits from the brands or companies  
they promote.  
If they are early adapters, among the first to recognise or promote a new opportunity or experi-  
ence, they can have a substantial influence on leisure and travel decisions.  
This factor can be added to the role of travel shows on television, and countless You-  
Tube videos and online material that is really disguised advertising, as a combination  
that has changed traditional thinking about decision-making. Kolb \(2020\) observed that  
­ information-seeking is no longer the necessary first step, and that online searchers, social  
media contacts, and influencers might very well constitute a consumer’s first knowledge  
of, and interest in, an event or travel product. It might be by accident, or because of par-  
ticipation in an online community. Wise destinations and events therefore participate  
aggressively in web design, social media interactions, and online promotions, establish  
their own blogs, and encourage the taking and sharing of photos and videos as a form of  
consumer-generated product.  
Consumer interactions are now continuous, including the availability of reviews and endorse-  
ments before decisions are made, sharing photos, videos, and real-time experiences at an  
event, and post-event evaluations that reach many other potential customers. This process  
cannot be controlled, only influenced. Reaction to bad publicity is as important as proactive  
image-making. 290  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
*Information Search and Use*  
This is a very under-researched area within event marketing, with a majority of related arti-  
cles dealing with sources used \(e.g., Wang and Cole, 2016\) and not actual search behaviour.  
Tasci et al. \(2018\) reviewed the evidence pertinent to sport tourism, finding that an important  
consideration is whether the decision is routine or unique. For some sport events and concert  
series a consumer can buy season tickets, or multi-day passes, thereby necessitating one big  
purchase decision – but there will still be a decision required for attending each and every  
game or concert. Loyal festival fans can also return year after year, in which case most of the  
same variables enter into the decision. When decision-making becomes routine, the person  
does not need a lot of information \(or perceives this to be true\), takes less time, and has a  
predisposition to act.  
Most event opportunities are likely to be unique decision-making episodes, especially when  
a travel purchase decision is required. In these cases, the consumer needs lots of informa-  
tion and might take a lot of time to obtain it. Part of the appeal of modern Internet market-  
ing is that the time component can be reduced substantially, and research has found that  
Internet shoppers tend to use only a few sites, thereby limiting their time expenditure. The  
risk factor also has to be considered, because every new decision to attend or participate in  
an event poses risks such as wasted time and money, bad experiences, and health and safety  
concerns.  
As Kolb \(2020\) noted, there will be cases, and this appears to be a growing market segment,  
where online communities of interest share information and ideas about travel and events,  
even creating their own, making the traditional information search less important or irrelevant.  
This prospect should become a research priority for marketers.  
The appearance of Chat Bots might change everything. Ask an AI Chat what events will satisfy  
particular interests and you can instantly get a list. Chat Bots, however, do not have preferences  
or make judgements. Maybe someday they will.  
*Demand\: Attractiveness of the Events*  
Demand is often equated with how many people will come to an event, or what they will pay for  
it. More correctly, in economic terms, it is a function of the relationship between price and the  
quantity demanded for an event, in particular circumstances. For each price, the demand rela-  
tionship tells the quantity the buyers want to buy at that corresponding price. The usual rela-  
tionship applies for most events, being lower demand for high-cost opportunities. However, in  
some cases, free-to-attend events will not motivate people, while very expensive experiences  
\(the luxury class\) will be more attractive.  
Consider other related factors. Usually, price is a monetary cost, as in how much an admis-  
sion ticket costs, but you might also want to put a value on the consumer’s time and energy  
expended, especially if travel is involved. For free-to-attend events, it is common to measure  
demand in terms of attendance, but organisers have to be cautious about interpreting this  
figure. Many people who attend might not be willing, or able to do so, if even a small fee is  
charged. When contemplating price, especially if a fee is to be charged for a previously free  
event, research on willingness to pay is required. This can be done with hypothetical research  
questions, such as “How much would you be willing to pay for...” or “Is this type of experi-  
ence as attractive as, say, going to a movie?” An alternative approach is to study the economic  
demand for other events, especially ones that raised their price. Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications A related concept is attractiveness. This means the drawing power or pull of an event, both its  
general appeal \(generic benefits\) and its targeted benefits for specific interests. In the context  
of economic demand, attractiveness could be equated with ‘market potential’ and measured by  
‘penetration rates’. That is, within a given market area, how many purchases can be expected,  
expressed as a percentage of the population? If half the people come twice, that is considered  
to be 100%. Different market areas also have to be considered, such as local, regional, national,  
and international zones.  
Events contribute to city and destination attractiveness, a fact that helps explain the rise of  
eventful cities and event portfolio management. Cities that pursue a strategy of maximising  
their attractiveness \(and in re-positioning and branding in general\) invest heavily in event bid-  
ding, production, marketing, incentivising, venues, and related infrastructure. Attractiveness  
also depends on one’s point of view, for example meeting planners versus potential attendees.  
Crouch et al. \(2019, 530\) determined the top factors influencing international convention site  
selection, for associations. These will all have been modified by the pandemic and ensuing  
travel disruptions, cost increases, and worker shortages. Cost is always a consideration, but  
not a motivator. Image and attractiveness cannot be separated. An event, venue, destination, or  
city might have everything desirable for general-purpose or event-specific visits but still hold a  
negative image in the minds of potential clients.  
291  
*Substitution*  
Just about every leisure and travel pursuit can be substituted. We do not absolutely need to  
go to a specific destination or participate in a specific event and \(this is assuming free choice\)  
there are always alternative ways to meet our leisure needs. If extrinsic motivations to attend  
an event apply, substitution takes on a different meaning. We might be able to learn what we  
need to know from different trade shows or meet the necessary contacts at different conven-  
tions, but these choices are less common than in the leisure realm. Many event attendees go  
to a specific event because it is the only one, or the best one to satisfy their purposes. The the-  
ory of ‘leisure substitution’ suggests that if a person cannot do one thing, he or she will choose  
another that provides similar psychological experiences, satisfactions, and benefits \(Brunson  
and Shelby, 1993\). This appears to be very true for primarily social experiences, where the  
activity, setting, or event is often of secondary concern. Events offering targeted benefits for  
highly involved persons are less substitutable than those offering only generic benefits.  
An emerging question is the potential substitution of live events with virtual events. The ben-  
efits and the experience, in general, are different, but what exactly would induce a person to  
consciously select the VR alternative?  
*Decision to Attend or Participate*  
Wanting to attend, even planning to, is quite different from going to an event. At some point,  
a commitment is made, perhaps money spent on travel or tickets, but something might still  
intervene to prevent attendance. Researchers therefore seek to discover the links between lev-  
els of awareness, interest in attending, forming a specific intention to go, and actual atten-  
dance. How are decisions made to attend or travel to events, and what factors are considered?  
Consider all the context and choices we have to understand\: Decision-making occurs in stages,  
with feedback called post-purchase evaluation. There is an awareness and opinion-forming stage,  
which might be combined with information gathering \(even if it’s no more than asking for  
someone’s advice\), during which the consumer forms an intent, or rejects the opportunity. 292  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
Reysen et al. \(2018\) employed the theory of planned behaviour to assess the intention to  
attend a fan convention, finding that attitudes, norms, perceived control, past behaviour, and  
in-group identification each predicted the intention to attend. This seems to suggest a social  
worlds approach to marketing.  
*Loyalty Versus Novelty-Seeking*  
Loyalty in the events sector is a complex concept. Except for professional sports and regular the-  
atrical productions, most events are unique opportunities. Numerous event-related decisions  
are never exactly repeated, and many people engage in novelty-seeking in travel and leisure,  
generally preferring something new each time a decision is made. But event loyalty does exist  
in some forms, as indicated by sport-fan loyalty to teams. Loyalty to periodic conferences and  
exhibitions exists, both because of the business or professional advantages and the enjoyment of  
socialising with friends who always meet there. Many people go to the same festivals year after  
year, especially those that have become traditions in their home or online communities. Event  
loyalty might apply to one type or genre, rather than a specific event. It is likely to result from  
obtaining specific benefits, especially those related to special interests. Loyalty might also be a  
lifestyle factor stemming from events that fit one’s work-life and social calendar.  
Researchers have explored the links with satisfaction, motivations, identity, and other variables.  
As an example, Ho et al. \(2022\) investigated festival loyalty among millennial participants,  
while Kamath et al. \(2023\) reviewed the literature on loyalty in the context of tourism and  
religious events. A popular area of research has been to link evaluation of quality \(or satisfac-  
tion\) with future intentions or, more ambitiously, to link antecedents \(including expectations of  
benefits sought, motivation, demographics, involvement, identity\) with experiences \(e.g., activ-  
ities, spending, type and level of engagement\) to quality evaluations, to satisfaction \(reflecting  
expectancy-disconfirmation\) and ultimately to future intentions \(i.e., repeat visits, loyalty, rec-  
ommendations\). Structural equation modelling \(SEM\) is often the preferred method, and obvi-  
ously, event-visitor data is required. An example is the study of Kim and Malek \(2017\). Creating  
memorable, transforming event experiences is the goal of many event producers, and if people  
really do enjoy and recollect events they are more likely to return – or seek out comparable expe-  
riences. While satisfaction is usually a precondition to loyalty, as confirmed in many studies, the  
mere realisation of expected benefits and satisfaction with service or programme quality is no  
guarantee of repeat visits. This brings us full circle in the decision-making model, stressing that  
antecedents include the influence of previous experience. What is not shown in the model are  
the effects of other kinds of experience on event-related behaviour. Also, broader forces are at  
work, including a person’s experiences with entertainment, sport, or business in general.

# Marketing Fundamentals  
The American Marketing Association has adopted this formal definition\:  
Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communi-  
cating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients,  
partners, and society at large.  
\(source\: https\://www.ama.org/AboutAMA/Pages/Definition-of-Marketing.aspx\)  
Marketing requires research to gain understanding of customers’ and other stakeholders’  
needs, motives, and choices, the effectiveness of communications, and the influences of price  
and supply. Customers are not the only group that requires relationship management – that  
task starts internally with staff and volunteers and extends externally through facilitators and  
allies. The essence of exchange relationships is that the organisation offers something of value  
that others are willing to buy or support; it has to be a voluntary and mutually beneficial pro-  
cess. In our case, events are offered as an experience for consumers to buy or guests to enjoy, a  
product to be delivered to clients, or a marketing tool for corporations.  
*Customer Versus Product Orientation*  
The classic marketing concept embodies the principle of customer orientation, which means the  
organisation develops events that are in demand by clearly defined customers or clients. In con-  
trast, a product orientation is often found in the events sector, particularly in the arts, where the  
event is presented as a work of art that has value on its own, regardless of economic demand  
or support. Art event producers do not necessarily have to sell their concepts to paying cus-  
tomers, but they do have to convince public grant-giving agencies and corporate sponsors of  
their merit.  
We should add two provisos to customer-orientation attitudes. The first is to argue that the  
customer is not always right, and event producers should not merely provide the entertainment  
and spectacle that will generate the highest profit or please the most vocal critics. Customers  
do need to be educated, and many will be happy to have their tastes modified, their minds  
stimulated, or their emotions uplifted. And even if customers are happy to pay for unsafe or  
environmentally destructive events, that is not an adequate reason to provide them. A second  
modification is that many events exist in the realm of public good, and do not need to respond  
only to market forces.  
*Service-Dominant Logic*  
The evolution of marketing theory has led to an emphasis on value co-creation within  
service-dominant logic. What it means to marketers is a mix of philosophy and practical applications. 294  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
Instead of selling, there should be a focus on creating value all around through knowledge and  
skills. Corporations and events will be facilitating customers in finding the value they need, with  
networks, online communities, and interest groups being encouraged and nurtured. At the centre  
is the guest and customer experience, with a view to maximising quality and encouraging loyalty.  
*The Marketing Mix*  
The marketing mix consists of the elements that can be managed to build and sustain essential  
stakeholder relationships. The usual 4Ps are product, price, place, and promotion, whereas the  
8 Ps advocated by Morrison \(1995\) cover more ground. We have grouped them into experiential  
and facilitating elements. The product is the event experience, although in tourism it is more useful  
to think of it as a package of experiences including the trip, the event, and ancillary experiences.  
The other marketing mix elements that directly affect the experience are place \(location, site,  
venue, or setting\), programming \(including the theme\), and people \(interactions among staff,  
volunteers, guests, and participants\).  
Facilitating components consist of partnerships, promotions, packaging \(including distribution  
channels\), and price. Partnerships refer to all the external stakeholder relationships to be man-  
aged. Packaging, especially in the context of event tourism, can sometimes be thought of as  
a product. That is because the tourist often prefers to buy travel, accommodation, and events  
all at once. Distribution is the process of communicating with customers and selling products,  
including by means of the Internet, social media, in-person sales, and packages sold through  
agents. Finally, price is a facilitating component because it determines who can, or wants to,  
make the purchase. Price can also affect the experience in the sense that perceived value for  
money impacts a consumer’s overall satisfaction.  
*Research, Evaluation, and Information Management for Event Marketing*  
Wood \(2004\) outlined the main marketing information needs for events, starting with setting  
event objectives. Research and information are also needed in the context of environmental  
scanning, customer analysis \(including segmentation and targeting, satisfaction, and expecta-  
tions\), competitor analysis and positioning, tactical marketing decisions, impacts, and strate-  
gic planning. The main research and data collection tools of event marketers include surveys,  
interviews, focus groups, and observation. Attendance counts \(or estimates\) and evaluation of  
marketing effectiveness are important tasks.  
*Segmentation and Target Marketing*  
Segmentation is often tied to motivation studies and has generated a wealth of studies  
\(e.g. Oakes, 2003; Taylor and Shanka, 2002\). Basic variables used in market segmentation  
for events start with simple geography \(market areas\), demographics \(age and gender\), and  
socio-economics \(income and class\), and can proceed to more challenging variables includ-  
ing benefits sought \(generic versus specific\), consumption patterns \(what people buy, how  
and where\) and visitation patterns \(repeat visits, loyalty, seasonality\). Many studies have seg-  
mented event visitors on the basis of motivation, including Lee et al. \(2004\) and Barbieri et al.  
\(2008\). Interesting variations on segmentation variables include Prentice and Anderson \(2003\)  
who segmented visitors to the Edinburgh Festival on the basis of ‘tourism styles’, which is simi-  
lar to a benefits-sought approach. Seven clusters of ‘consumption style’ were identified, reflecting  
different interest levels in international or Scottish performing arts, and in the historic city. Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications Segmentation has been based on serious leisure \(Mackellar, 2009, 2013\), involvement  
\(­ Robinson and Getz, 2016\), expenditure \(Dixon et al., 2012\), planned behaviour theory  
\(Horng et al., 2013\), how stakeholders segment event audiences \(Tkaczynski, 2013\), music  
genre preferences \(Kruger et al., 2011\), skill and expertise in the context of recreation spe-  
cialisation \(Lamont and Jenkins, 2013\), and leisure benefits \(Lyu and Lee, 2013\). Kruger et al.  
\(2018\) reviewed the literature on motives-based segmentation and studied a nature-based  
event. Sharma and Nayak \(2018\) undertook an emotions-based approach to segment yoga  
tourists. Tasci et al. \(2018\) segmented sport tourists versus non-sport tourists on the basis of  
socio-demographic, psychographic, and travel-behaviour variables. Abkarian et al. \(2022\) used  
spatial-temporal activity patterns, employing GPS data, to segment visitors.  
It should be kept in mind that segmentation is designed to aid marketing, but the related  
research can also provide new insights on fundamental questions of need, motivation, and  
benefits obtained.  
295  
*Social Marketing Through Events*  
Social marketing has been defined as “...the adaptation of traditional marketing technolgies to pro-  
grams designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare  
and that of the society of which they are part” \(Andreason, 1994, 110\). Jutbring \(2018\) discussed  
how events can frame issues or act as a catalyst. He distinguished between upstream interven-  
tions targeted at influencers and policymakers, and downstream interventions targeted at consum-  
ers. The outcome of downstream interventions is the adoption of advocated attitudes and/or  
behaviour. For example, Andersson, Jutbring and Lundberg \(2018\) studied vegetarian eating as  
the desired behaviour, with the event eliminating meat from its premises in order to promote  
the cause and induce appropriate behaviour.  
Increasingly festivals and other events have been created as social marketing instruments, and  
many incorporate social marketing roles and messages with the aim of changing policies, atti-  
tudes, and consumer behaviour. These have included anti-smoking and drugs, gender equality,  
and education for environmental sustainability. Much of the social marketing activity of events  
occurs on-site, with the festival experience hopefully contributing to increased acceptance of  
the messages and adoption of advocated positions or activities. For example, events going green  
will educate their audiences and encourage \(or require\) them to minimise energy and water  
consumption as well as reduce waste. However, Hofman, Walters, and Hughes \(2022\) compared  
virtual and real-life marine tourism experiences. They found that VR technology experiences can  
be just as effective as real-life experiences in influencing conservation behaviours.  
# Communications Fundamentals  
Masterman and Wood \(2006\) considered not only the traditional communications mix by which  
the event reaches its targets, but also examined how events are used as communications  
tools. They emphasise ‘integrated marketing communications’ \(IMC\), which has been advanced in  
response to perceived failures of mass media, to new media options, and to demands from cli-  
ents for demonstrating the return on investment from marketing efforts. IMC is highly targeted  
\(both customer and multi-stakeholder-oriented\), combines all the communications tools for  
consistency and synergy, and stresses relationship and branding goals.  
Expert Opinion 12.1 by Barbara Mazza summarises major trends in event communications,  
beginning with the effects of the pandemic. 296

EXPERT OPINION 12.1\: By Professor Barbara Mazza  
Trends in Event Communications  
Barbara is Associate Professor \(Roma, Italy\) and qualified full professor since 2023, in  
the Department of Communication and Social Research of the Sapienza University of  
Rome, where teaches Communication for Business Management and Event Manage-  
ment and Communication. From 2017–2018 to 2023–2024, she was the President of  
the Master’s degree course “Organization and Marketing for business communication”.  
Two relevant publications are\:

development of sport tourism. *Sustainability*, *15* \(*9*\), 7039.  
The pandemic crisis caused worldwide by Covid-19, which has significantly affected  
the events sector, has accented the spotlight on events communication, affirming its  
centrality not only as a tool or promotional content but as a strategic process for devel-  
oping the industry. But what trends were already evolving before the pandemic and  
that, above all, are in full development during subsequent recovery? This brief reflec-  
tion presents the main changes summarised in three categories\: organic management  
of processes and relationships, the centrality of an authentic approach, and digital  
transformation.  
Organic management of processes and relationships\: In cyclical and planned  
events, especially large and mega ones, communication already has a strategic role in  
event management and accompanies all phases of ideation, planning, and realisation  
of the event. It synergises with the other operating units to pursue objectives and  
goals. However, the adoption of a systematic and transparent approach that allows  
communication to listen and actively involve all stakeholders is increasingly necessary  
because this helps achieve results. Van Niekerk and Getz \(2019\) have also highlighted  
the importance of the evolution of ‘internal’ communication because it allows the  
needs of stakeholders to be identified and included in the event project. This also  
requires that the communication areas \(press office, public relations, media relations  
management, social media managers, etc.\) work in an integrated and convergent  
manner with each other and the other units. Relationship management is the heart of  
an organisational machine’s efficiency and the engine that makes it work more effec-  
tively. For this reason, all events must be aware of the importance of this approach  
and make the most of it.  
The centrality of an authentic approach\: Communication is the main content of the  
event. It announces, creates anticipation and motivation to participate, stimulates shar-  
ing among those who participate, gratifies during participation, and feeds the memory  
and anticipation for the next edition. The great revolution of recent years depends on  
transitioning from a conception of spectacularisation to authenticity. Being authentic  
does not mean abandoning the use of wow effects in organising the event’s main activ-  
ities but shifting the focus dedicated only to the offer to manage it so that users are  
the real protagonists in all phases\: pre, during, and after the event. Spectacularisation Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications 297  
aims to amaze, fascinate, and enhance the setting and script of the event using sym-  
bolic and expressive elements that transform reality into a collective imagination, while  
authenticity guarantees greater adherence to truth \(Domínguez-Quintero, González-Rodríguez  
and Roldán, 2019; Kim, Whitford, and Arcodia, 2019; Park, Choi, and Lee,  
2019\). Recent studies show that this is what users want \(Pöyry et al., 2019; Syvertsen  
and Enli, 2020; Zhang et al., 2019\)\: an accurate and objective picture of the offer that  
recalls principles and values, identities and traditions, community spirit, cultural and  
environmental heritage, managerial and economic rigour. People want to choose con-  
sciously, evaluate different aspects, and immerse themselves in experiences appropri-  
ate to their expectations and needs and from comparison with others. In this way, the  
experience that users have does not only aim to impress but to amaze the emotions,  
sensations, and knowledge they benefit from the event. Packer, Ballantyne, and Bond  
\(2019\) point out that the experience does not need to be emotionally intense to be  
memorable. However, it is memorable when visitors have the conditions to create their  
narratives, starting from the gratification the experience produces when it is tailored  
to their needs. Also, in this case, listening to and involving users means organising the  
offer to make people protagonists.  
Digital transformation\: This ‘authentic revolution’ is undoubtedly favoured by digital  
transformation that acts on several levels. The first level concerns the physiognomy of the  
events, which determines the possibility of participating in the event in different ways.  
Most events have become hybrid because they can be followed remotely on social media  
and streaming. However, digital events are only made online, virtual events in which peo-  
ple can participate in virtual environments, such as the metaverse, through avatars and  
*phygital*, i.e., events that combine the best of the physical and virtual offers. However,  
the types of possible events could multiply depending on the combinations of the differ-  
ent types and the evolution of available technologies. In any case, the important thing  
is to offer the user, who is already used to using all the tools available in an omnichannel  
way, all possible opportunities to participate and to live authentic experiences \(Brown,  
Luzmore, and Groß Ophoff, 2022\). Even in the virtual, realism increases the value of the  
‘immersive’ experience when it is accessible, reasonable concerning requests, distinctive  
in its characteristics, and emotionally engaging \(Dixon, Hall, and Shawon, 2019; Estanyol,  
2021\). The second level of digital transformation concerns the packaging of the event.  
Technologies are used in all operational sectors of the event to manage and optimise  
various actions\: coordination of human resources through management and applications,  
administrative management, security, logistics, marketing, ticketing, and sales services  
through e-commerce, etc. In communication, they are helpful for the collection and anal-  
ysis of big data that are used for the evaluation and reporting of the event for the organ-  
isers, partners, financiers, and sponsors, for the management of service information for  
stakeholders and users, and for promotional ones, for packaging wow effects during the  
event and to encourage user participation and engagement.  
Concerning this last aspect, the third level is to increase the value of the experiences  
lived by the participants before, during, and after the event, both on a physical level  
and in digital and virtual environments. For example, contactless technologies are  
widely used that use QR-codes and beacons to increase services offered immediately  
and contact points, such as bracelets with RFid, blockchain and NFT \(non-fungible  
tokens\) technology, microchips, and leds for increased special effects, simulators, 298  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
ai, IoT, vr to create experiences in 3D environments and augmented reality to per-  
sonalise experiences more by providing real-time updates of multimedia content.  
These technologies are already widely used, for example, in creating exhibition events,  
shows, fairs, conventions, concerts, and festivals. These tools amplify the opportunities  
to make the most of the event on an individual and collective level, increasing the per-  
ception of the event’s value and the experience offered \(Hopkins and Siekelova, 2021\).  
In this sense, technologies make the perceived experience more complete, inclusive,  
and satisfying. There may be more technologies available in the future. The important  
thing is not to have more tools but to know how to make the most of them to make  
the event optimise their use according to the objectives and needs of all the actors  
involved because only in this way are they applicable to the event. It is essential to  
co-create it, affecting everyone and sharing the benefits. This is the strategic role of  
communication.

*Positioning*  
The aim of the positioning is to differentiate your event or destination from others, in relation  
to its attributes, brand, or identity, thereby achieving a competitive advantage – or at least a  
favourable image. Image building means communicating \(and delivering\) what you want stake-  
holders to think of you. Identity and brand reflect values and core competencies. Positioning  
goes with target marketing and thereby requires segmentation. It is all interrelated.  
It can start with an examination of what makes the event unique and attractive. Use a grid sim-  
ilar to IP \(illustrated in Figure 11.5\) to construct a positioning map that compares the event’s  
features against competitors. For example, start with location, setting, and accessibility. Are  
other events better positioned? Include programming features, cost, and reputation. To make  
the comparisons more valid employ market research. What are the most important attractions  
and features to your target segments and how do they rate your event compared to others in  
the market area? The map could therefore plot event locations along an axis of accessibility  
\(poor to excellent\) and an axis of cost. Usually you want to be positioned as highly accessible  
and low-cost, relative to competitors.  
If segmentation is not already available, derive target segments from the research or from a  
scan of competitive or complimentary events. The process can be iterative. Many event produc-  
ers will do this positioning exercise in their minds, based on what they already know - which  
might be good, but is likely incomplete. A positioning statement could read something like this\:  
“Our event is the best priced, offering the most value for money, among all family oriented  
events in the city”. The more specific, the better.  
Kolb \(2020\) discussed three approaches or strategies for branding, positioning, and advertising  
events\: features, benefits, and values. These also have implications for the design and co-creation  
of experiences. A features approach emphasises what the event offers in terms of activities, expe-  
riences, services, and setting. A benefits approach goes deeper into motivation and therefore  
requires more careful targeting. Benefits segmentation and marketing require research focusing  
on special interests, as well as generic needs. It is important to differentiate generic benefits that  
might appeal to a wide audience, including socialising, escapism, entertainment, and novelty-  
seeking, from lifestyle-related or serious-leisure benefits that include belonging and sharing  
within well-defined communities or special-interest segments. There are clear decisions to be  
taken if special-interest benefits are the focus, as there is virtually an unlimited number of such  
communities, and mixing them might be difficult or unwise. Values-based segmentation identifies  
attitudes, lifestyles, and underlying values, making it a very sophisticated positioning approach.  
A shortcut to doing the research is to work with existing communities of interest to understand  
their values, then design and market accordingly. Combining the three approaches is possible  
and might be the best strategy. Consider a running event that features a high level of physical  
challenge in a natural environment, explicitly promotes socialising and community building  
with a strong, online presence, and reflects conservation values by adhering to sustainability  
principles and contributing financially to conservation efforts and local communities. Where  
would it be positioned relative to other events? It might actually be completely unique.  
*Branding and Co-Branding*  
The essence of a brand is that it communicates the desired image and identity to the public, and  
especially to target segments, in ways that yield either a competitive advantage or strong stake-  
holder support. It is a concept, with its communication \(by symbols such as a logo, ­ messages,  
such as positioning statements, and trademarks\) all working together to support the desired 300  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
image and identity. Brands should be tied to the event’s core values, and brands have a mone-  
tary value – which is why the Olympics protects its name and famous intersecting rings with  
vigorous legal action.  
Branding is a huge marketing topic, however little work has been published on the process or  
success of branding events. Mossberg and Getz \(2006\) used case studies to examine a number  
of concepts and issues involving festival branding. One of the standard approaches is to use  
a city’s name, often in conjunction with specification of the festival genre, as in the Calgary  
Children’s Festival. Another common approach, at least in North America, is co-branding with  
a corporate sponsor including the selling of title rights \(e.g., ‘TD Canada Trust Calgary Interna-  
tional Jazz Festival’\). One conclusion of the Mossberg and Getz \(2006\) study was that festival  
managers were not fully applying branding theory to their events.  
Co-branding is common and offers several advantages. Events can augment their marketing  
\(and perhaps gain more resources\) by co-branding with sponsors, tourist agencies \(i.e., the  
destination\), or other events \(as in Festivals Edinburgh\). Event portfolios offer small events  
an opportunity to be part of a better-marketed brand, gaining by association with major events  
in the portfolio. The Hallmark Event is of necessity co-branded with its host community or  
destination. These events are embedded in a network of support, and have a strong brand that  
reflects, and impacts the host communities. If one suffers in terms of reputation, both do.  
Events contribute to destination or national brands \(e.g., Bodet and Lacassagne, 2012; Chalip  
and Costa, 2006; Chen, 2012\) with Richards \(2017\) discussing the value of events in place  
branding. The book Urban Events, Place Branding and Promotion\: Place Event Marketing \(Cudny,  
2020\) explored this line of research through case studies, focusing on cities that use events to  
build an attractive place brand.  
*Reputation Management*  
Reputation literally means what people think of you, or of an event. It is judgemental, so it is  
different from \(but linked to\) image – which stems from perceived attributes. Reputations and  
images can be compared, resulting in positioning strategies such as “We want to be thought of  
as the best in our class in this country”. Fiedler et al. \(2023\) discussed four reputation man-  
agement factors relevant to events\:  
–  
–  
–  
–  
Role of the founder or senior management team\: Organisational culture and leadership are  
important in shaping the event and its evolution, and in dealing with image or reputation  
challenges.  
Environmental context\: Fitting into the community and responding to environmental  
changes has an impact.  
Communications\: All forms of media are used to deal with problems, advance a positive  
image, and convey values.  
Stakeholder relationship management\: Developing legitimacy and maintaining support is  
important, as is staying authentic.  
*New and Social Media*  
New media have radically altered traditional communications strategies. New media refers to dig-  
ital technologies and communications platforms, as distinct from traditional print, television, Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications radio, and other static, one-way channels. New media also facilitates the development,  
­ distribution, and sale of products, and can include\:  
l Podcasts\: available on demand; present information, opinion, and discussion of important  
topics.  
l Websites that provide information, facilitate sales, and encourage feedback.  
l Webinars\: event expertise sharing and discussion.  
l Internet ads attached to other advertisers, sponsors, or partners.  
l YouTube videos.  
l Hybrid and virtual events \(when designed as communications with target segments, as well as  
being augmentation to live-event experiences\).  
The main difference between traditional media and new media is new media’s capacity to be  
stored, presented, and distributed over telecommunications networks, often global in scope,  
and accessible to many different types of devices\: smartphones/watches; computers; pads; and  
smart TVs. Many devices incorporate cameras for photo and video recording, enabling a wide  
range of visual sharing on numerous sites like TikTok. Of course, these have been around for  
a number of years, but their utility in event design and management has been expanding,  
partly because of the global pandemic. Advantages include speed \(instant communications\)  
and precise targeting \(usually through social media and online interest communities\). Events  
can form, shape, or merely join communities of interest that link to event experiences and  
brands. Market intelligence comes from direct feedback, including at the event itself, and from  
netnography \(analysing Instagram posts, for example\). Several potential disadvantages or prob-  
lems should be noted, starting with the obvious caution that the Internet and social media are  
full of misinformation, and events have no control over what is being said about them – they  
often have to react. Groups that lobby against events, or the building of venues, for example,  
can freely operate in opposition to anything communicated by proponents \(although censor-  
ship in some countries is a concern\). Finally, the privacy of communications and data has to be  
protected against hackers and improper use.  
The revolution in new media, which is as much social as it is technological in nature, led  
Kolb \(2020\) to emphasise the differences between paid, owned, earned, and shared media. Paid  
refers to traditional advertising, although with more media options now available. Instead of  
relying on advertising, a major aim has been added to attracting attention and distributing  
information, which is to drive interested consumers to the event’s owned media, including  
websites, social media accounts, blogs, video/audio/photo libraries, and webinars. According  
to Kolb \(2020, 136\) earned media consists of information shared and discussion of the event  
on independent sites, including how questions were answered, complaints handled, and mis-  
information dealt with. Largely this is beyond the control of an organisation, but it has to  
be vigilant and know when to respond. This is especially important during live events when  
customer/guest interaction with organisers is almost instantaneous and can make or break  
the experience.  
An important element in all marketing and communications is the content, its nature and  
quality, timeliness, and appeal. Events can be content creators in many ways, not the least  
of which is social media and online stories, images, videos, entertainment, information, and  
education. While some of this content can be designed to earn revenue, some are intended to  
attract attention and interest.  
301 302  
Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications  
*Social Media and Social Networking*  
First, we need to distinguish between social media as technical platforms for communications,  
such as TikTok, Twitter, or Facebook, and the actual social interaction that takes place. Online  
communities of interest are formed through interactions, they do not automatically arise from  
the existence of a platform. The implications of social media are manifold. Organisations and  
governments can no longer control information and discourse, not even news reporting. Cor-  
porations have found that brands are not theirs to exclusively create and manage, as everyone  
has an opinion and a potential audience. The event experience can be augmented by pre-,  
during, and post-event interactions to foster engagement and increase satisfaction. New niche  
markets are being created all the time, reflecting real and virtual social worlds. They offer the  
opportunity to co-create events interactively with online communities.  
Laurell and Björner \(2018\) stressed the need for continuous analysis of social media content.  
Analytics should cover the following\:  
l Analysis of content concerning the festival; what people are saying about it; pictures and  
videos posted \(this can include netnography to qualitatively evaluate the nature of attend-  
ees’ experiences, the high and low points, likes and dislikes, and recommendations for  
improvements\).  
l Analysis of general trends and issues that might be relevant to festivals.  
l Obtaining feedback and addressing issues; countering negative stories \(a real-time presence  
is ideal so that if a question or situation arises on the festival site it can immediately be  
addressed – and this also facilitates crowd management and emergency responses\).  
l Using social media to expand networks.  
STUDY GUIDE  
Figure 12.1 illustrates the main factors considered in the consumer’s decisions leading to event  
attendance, and that is the guiding model for studying this chapter. This model is partly in the  
realm of psychology and consumer research, but also in the economics of supply and demand,  
and cultural and social forces. The discussion started with personal factors, specifically per-  
sonality, values, attitudes, and lifestyle. Then needs, motivations, and motives were examined,  
considering the seeking-escaping theory and how needs and wants shape expectations. Review  
the model illustrating generic and event-specific motivations \(related to the benefits they offer\)  
and how that has influenced your own decisions. Theory on barriers and constraints, and how  
they are overcome or negotiated, is also important for marketers. Consider how time, cost,  
inconvenience, and lack of information restrict choices and actual demand for events and what  
marketers can do about it. When it comes to communications, consider how your own use of  
social media has or might influence your leisure and event-related decisions. Are you part of an  
online community? Finally, it would be useful to find examples of how events are linked with  
consumers and online communities – what media are used, and what are the messages?  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Explain how personality, values, attitudes, and lifestyle relate to interest in, and demand for  
event experiences.  
l What is the relevance of the theory of planned behaviour in the model of antecedents and  
decision-making for event attendance? Antecedents, Event Marketing, and Communications l What are basic human needs, and how do they link to motivation? What is the difference  
between motivation and motives? Give examples.  
l How important are seeking versus escaping motivations in explaining event attendance?  
What have researchers found that confirms or rejects this theory when applied to events?  
l Do most people attend festivals for generic or specific benefits? Where do essential services  
enter the decision-making process?  
l How are expectations formed? Consider post-event evaluation.  
l Explain leisure constraint theory and how it applies to events. Differentiate between the  
main types of constraints, and give event-specific examples.  
l What are the roles of an event website, and social media, in information searches and the  
decision to attend an event?  
l What is the demand for events? How are attractiveness and substitution related to demand?  
l What factors help explain the differences between loyalty and novelty-seeking with regard  
to event behaviour? Where does nostalgia fit in?  
l Compare the traditional marketing and communications mixes and explain how they are  
being changed by new media.  
l Discuss place marketing and events with reference to branding and positioning.  
l Explain social marketing and how it links with the concept of events as agents of change.

# Introduction  
In this chapter, several management functions have been brought together because of the  
many serious threats facing the events sector, whether the events are planned or unplanned,  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003374251-13 Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events large or small. Risk management provides an umbrella concept for them all, but the threats and  
­ necessary strategies for dealing with them are different. Ashwin \(2021, 49\) noted the serious-  
ness of ­ contemporary threats and the critical importance of risk management\: “...there has been  
an increasing public discourse and emerging legislative requirements for event organizers to demonstrate  
an evidence-based approach to risk management decisions with the ability to explain the rationale behind  
those decisions in clear, objective and transparent terms”. Risk management covers health and safety,  
leading to a discussion of crowd management and controls. Crisis management requires special  
considerations and raises the question of how resilient organisations can be. Finally, environ-  
mental management is discussed in the context of event greening and sustainability.

# Terminology  
Threat or Hazard\: An action or force that can cause loss or damage. Severe weather is a  
threat, as it might damage infrastructure and disrupt programming. Cybercriminals intent on  
stealing data or extorting money are a financial threat. Alcohol and drug abuse pose threats to  
guests and equipment. Disease is an ever-present threat to the health of attendees, but it can  
be invisible. Crowding threatens to cause stampedes, crushes, and personal injury or death.  
Threats have to be identified and countered. In today’s world, threats of all kinds have become  
so serious that the event producer and managers, event venues and sponsors, are adamant that  
risk management is one of the most important management functions.  
Attack\: An attack is an immediate problem that must be met with an appropriate, and there-  
fore planned, response. Cyber-attacks should be preventable, but hackers are always probing  
for weaknesses. One common attack is denial of service by overloading websites, another is  
­ ransomware – extortion by way of locking computers and demanding a payment to free up the  
lost data. Terrorist and criminal assaults are met with a police or military response. Less visible  
are attacks on reputation and image, as these can be as subtle as the spreading of disinforma-  
tion or the fabrication of customer complaints. Again, there are ways to defend, but once the  
attack is recognised there has to be a planned response. Attacks on individuals at events are  
criminal in nature, requiring on-site policing and fully rehearsed emergency responses.  
Risk\: What is at risk if a threat materialises? Health and safety are at risk if there is a violent  
attack on-site. The organisation’s financial viability is at risk if cyber criminals hack a data-  
base. Reputation can be damaged when anything goes wrong, especially if it turns out that the  
organisers were not aware, not taking adequate preventative action, not adhering to standards  
\(or the law\), and were not prepared to cope with the consequences.  
Events are risky! There is no possibility of avoiding all risks when people assemble, events are  
risky by their very nature. Human interaction produces hazards, and this fact must be acknowl-  
edged by all event producers and managers, venues, and sponsors. Some events are so risky  
they require specialised insurance or are unable to find insurers. Some people love taking risks,  
or watching others do it, which explains the popularity of dangerous sports \(e.g., motor racing\)  
and combative sports \(e.g., boxing, mixed martial arts\). When people or animals are at risk,  
some will protest, or attempt to disrupt. Animal-rights groups oppose rodeo, for example, and  
in many countries, animal fights are banned by law. The point is that risk and events are insep-  
arable, making risk management both a political and managerial issue.  
Residual risks remain after responses have been implemented. In other words, complete elimi-  
nation is not always possible, such as the financial costs occurring to an organisation after an  
accident has been satisfactorily dealt with. Secondary risks can occur as a consequence of the  
response to attacks or other incidents, and they might occur long after the response. It might 306  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
take many months or even years for lawsuits to be processed on an organisation, or for indirect  
impacts on the community or environment to be revealed.  
Fat-Tail risks\: These are rare, but very harmful when they do occur – such as the pandemic.  
Impacts can be long-lasting, resulting in structural changes to systems. The phrase comes from  
probability theory, when a distribution is not perfectly normal, but demonstrates skewness or  
asymmetry. The mistake people make is thinking that normal will always prevail.  
Worst-case scenario\: In risk planning, asking “What is the worst thing that could happen?” might  
be a useful exercise, but all too often disasters cannot be predicted. For many organisations  
the pandemic was a worst case in the sense that it was extremely destructive. It was unpre-  
dictable in some ways, yet scientists have been warning for many years that a serious, global  
pandemic was likely. And other pandemics are likely in the future, so lessons must be learned  
and preparations have to be made, if not at the level of an individual event then certainly at the  
level of portfolios important to cities and corporations.  
Accident\: an unintended and unwanted occurrence that results in injury or loss. Sometimes  
the expression Act of God or Force Majeure is used to describe natural calamities that cannot be  
prevented \(and will not be insured\). An accident occurring outside the event can be an exter-  
nally imposed threat.  
Disaster\: We use the term disaster to describe sudden and unexpected occurrences that cause  
major damage or disruption to systems, such as earthquakes or fires. They can be beyond the  
control of organisations and therefore constitute external threats. They may cause a crisis at  
a national or regional level, with emergency forces mobilised, or in the case of the pandemic  
with new rules and regulations put in place to counter the threat. If disease is a threat, the risks  
to events include postponement, financial losses, and even bankruptcy, thereby constituting a  
crisis that might or might not be resolved.  
Crisis\: externally imposed, a crisis is a condition or turning point \(such as a disaster or pandemic\)  
that changes everything, and which requires an immediate response. Internally, a crisis can be  
defined as the inability to cope with a threat or problem. Uncertainty is a hallmark of crises.  
Emergency\: a condition, situation, or occurrence that is, or is believed to be, endangering life  
or property and requires an urgent response.  
Incident\: a specific occurrence, such as an accident, that usually can be managed. Incident  
reports are needed, and documentation analysed for patterns or trends.  
Vulnerability\: Inadequate planning and management systems leave events vulnerable, so a  
vulnerability analysis by experts is a good starting point. Internal reviews will also be beneficial  
and should be made routine. Keep in mind that a threat could result in multiple risks, as finan-  
cial and reputational damage often follows from accidents and other problems experienced at  
events. This can lead to cascading risks, with one following the other.  
Uncertainty\: Estimating the probability that a threat will occur, or that a risk will materialise,  
is inherent in risk management. For example, how likely is it that the next pandemic will result  
in event terminations, and how severe will the financial losses be to individual events and the  
entire sector? Uncertainty is a major part of risk management because we cannot accurately  
predict the future or all cause-effect relationships. We live with uncertainty on a daily basis, it  
cannot be avoided. It can, however, be studied, and we must learn from experience.  
Severity\: The probability of occurrence is one factor in risk or vulnerability assessments, and the  
other is severity. It cannot be measured on one scale, as the loss of life cannot be compared with  
a financial loss \(although courts often award compensation for injury or death according to set Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events schedules\). Probability times Severity \(P X S\) is one of the important calculations, always an  
estimate, to be made in risk management.  
Resilience\: to endure by adapting; to bounce back after a crisis. Resilience should be thought  
of as an element of sustainability.  
Risk Management\: This definition is from the book Risk Management for Events by Julia Ruth-  
erford Silvers and William O’Toole \(Routledge, 2nd ed., 2020\)\:  
Risk management is the purposeful recognition of and reaction to uncertainties  
with the explicit objective to minimize liabilities and maximise opportunities using  
a structured approach and common sense, rather than avoiding the issue. The  
risk manager looks at all the vulnerabilities, including financial and professional  
vulnerabilities, and the threats to property and life and limb and makes and carries  
out decisions that lessen the effects of potential losses.  
In the above definition, two other terms are used that have to be discussed. Liability is both a  
legal and moral issue. What is the event \(or its organisers, owners, staff, and sponsors\) liable  
for if something goes wrong? Liability can include the necessity to pay compensation or a fine,  
or even face criminal charges. Events and venues, their owners and managers, are sometimes  
charged with criminal offences when people are injured or killed, and often sued by individuals  
for all manner of harm caused. This is why venues and events require patrons to sign waivers  
\(i.e., “you accept the risks and cannot hold us responsible for loss or injury”\) or place such  
conditions on tickets. In open events, with no tickets or entry controls, this is not possible and  
so liability might increase greatly.  
Moral issues arise when events are not faced with the prospect of legal action, but feel respon-  
sible for the losses or injuries experienced by guests or others. Does the event have insurance  
to cover injuries to guests? Is there a fund to compensate people? Or do the organisers plead  
a lack of resources and take no responsibility? These moral issues should be considered in  
advance, as they are certain to arise. There is another aspect of liability to be considered. Who  
exactly is liable for losses incurred by events? To host the Olympics, for example, national  
governments are required to provide security and accept liability for certain potential losses or  
damages. When a publicly owned festival loses money, who has to pay off the debt? If this is  
not made explicit, legal problems could become severe. This is the underwriting problem.  
Due Diligence\: event organisers have a moral and legal responsibility to investigate haz-  
ards, conduct risk management professionally and according to standards, and advise guests/customers  
of any risks being assumed by them. These must be thoroughly documented.  
Negligence\: failure to act reasonably or as required by law, regulation, or accepted standards  
can be called negligence. It might also include reckless indifference \(gross negligence\), deliber-  
ate disregard \(wilful misconduct\), or intent to cause harm \(malice\).  
Accessibility\: events are usually subject to regulations regarding accessibility, either in terms  
of physical movements \(e.g., for wheelchairs\) or other forms of disability \(e.g., visual\). Safety is  
also a bigger concern for people with special needs. Elsewhere we discuss accessibility in other  
terms, including the exclusion of disadvantaged segments and those affected by discrimination.

# Threats and Risks Facing Events  
Numerous threats or hazards face the event producer, workers, and visitors, all of which pose  
risks. Researchers have examined many of these, including protests \(Henderson, 2008; Horne 308  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
and Whannel, 2010\); terrorism \(Toohey, 2008\); riots \(Cunneen and Lynch, 1988\); health issues  
\(Ahmed et al., 2006; Choi and Almanza, 2012; Earl et al., 2005\); crowd problems \(Earl, 2008\);  
crime \(Barker et al., 2002; Campaniello, 2013; George and Swart, 2012; Matheson and Finkel,  
2013\); and alcohol \(Pegg et al., 2011\). Mass shootings and crushes that kill and injure guests  
are extreme cases in terms of casualties, but all too common.  
Many problems and threats are correlated with the size of events and their ability to attract  
media coverage. Terrorism and crime in the modern world necessitate high-level security and  
control measures. Bad weather and unpredictable environmental forces, including the state of  
the economy, can drastically affect turnout and sales. Attracting the wrong people or incompat-  
ible segments could lead to trouble.  
Table 13.1 is a starting point, as the major categories can be subdivided into many more detailed  
threats and risks. It draws on the book Crisis Management and Recovery for events by V. Ziakas,  
V. Antchak, and D. Getz \(Goodfellow, 2021\). Note that threats \(or hazards\), when they occur,  
impose risks \(see the definitions above\). The table lists both external and internal threats, by

# Risk Management Process  
Those seeking details should consult the International Standard for Risk Management  
\(www.ISO.org\). ISO 31000, Risk management – Guidelines.  
According to Silvers and O’Toole \(2020\), there are four stages in the process, as illustrated  
in Figure 13.1. Documentation and communication are to be constant, as are monitoring and  
controls. Planning is to be integrated with all the other management systems, and in particu-  
lar must be synchronised with the design of the setting and programme. Someone should be  
assigned the responsibility, or a team devoted to risk management \(including health, security,  
and environmental, where appropriate\). The resulting risk management plan should contain  
goals and objectives, statements on who is responsible and how the implementation is to  
occur, procedures and resources, monitoring, information system, assessment techniques, and 310

Figure 13.1 Risk Management Process  
*Source\:* Adapted from Silvers and O’Toole \(2020\)  
responses \(e.g., contingency plans, emergency procedures\). Stakeholder engagement in this  
process is essential, including external agencies like police, fire, and health services.  
The process starts with planning, as determined by context. Large events and those with inherently  
risky elements will require more than small events in terms of resources and time devoted to risk  
planning and management. Every event needs a strategy, however, and goals to guide the process.  
This leads to specifications \(linked to risk responses\) that get translated into all aspects of design  
and operations. At this stage, the procedures for ongoing monitoring, reporting, and communi-  
cations among all stakeholders should be established, in concert with contingency planning \(e.g.,  
police, fire, medical\). The next two stages are identification and analysis. Obviously, the best and easi-  
est way to identify threats and risks is based on direct experience plus the experience of others. The  
type of event is important, as there are categorically different considerations for meetings versus  
sports or exhibitions. Silvers and O’Toole \(2020\) recommended several tools, as follows.  
Gap Analysis\: based on experience, what differences occurred between expectations \(or spec-  
ifications\) and outcomes. This is clearly a process of internal monitoring and evaluation.  
Where gaps or unexpected outcomes are found, root-cause analysis can be used to trace it  
back to its origins. Dangerous or hazardous conditions and areas within events need to be  
identified, as well as hazardous activities and crowd conditions.  
Hazard Mapping\: Locate the threats or hazards on a map, and describe them in documents.  
Some threats will be external and general, many hazards will be internal and associated with  
site planning and logistics.  
Scenario Making\: Based on consultations with experts and stakeholders, a number of what-if  
scenarios can be composed, including the necessary responses.  
SWOT Analysis\: Strengths can be equated with sound management and resilience, and weak-  
nesses with vulnerabilities. Crises and external threats can also present opportunities, as  
entrepreneurs often look for profound changes in systems \(such as the economy\) that reveal  
gaps to be filled or new needs and demands.  
Work or Task Analysis\: As employed in project planning, and combined with scheduling \(such  
as critical paths\), threats can be identified for every element in the event project, including  
the threat of delays.  
Risk Analysis\: In order to develop effective risk response and treatment plans within the  
constraints of limited resources, the risk manager must analyse the identified risks to Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events determine their causes, consequences, correlations, probability, and priority. Risks must be  
ranked to determine their order of importance or urgency so that the most critical ones will  
be addressed in the proper order according to legal, ethical, and risk tolerance parameters.  
The safety and welfare of people must always be the number one priority, with the loss of  
vital information second, particularly in an emergency situation.  
Probability X Severity matrix\: This matrix analysis is always a good exercise for stakeholders  
to conduct, involving all those who will be part of the planning, management, and response  
to threats and risks. Probability means how likely is it that something will occur, such as\:  
“What is the probability of severe weather posing a safety threat on a given day in this loca-  
tion”? Probability can best be estimated using available data, but keep in mind that unlikely  
occurrences \(such as a tornado\) can have severe consequences. That is why the matrix  
cannot be used to eliminate planning for low-probability risks. It must be used to assess all  
hazards, threats, and risks. What will emerge from any P X S analysis is a set of risks that  
must be avoided, others that can be reduced in likelihood or severity, and some that are so  
uncertain that additional information or analysis is required.  
Ashwin \(2021, 52\) provided an example of such a matrix, which he called a ‘heat map’. Five risk  
levels ranged from low to very high, while probability ranged from “almost certain to rare”.  
­ Consequences were categorised as “insignificant, minor, moderate, significant, or severe”. Ashwin  
used a semi-quantitative matrix with numeric values assigned to both P and S. An alternative  
is risk ranking whereby scores are assigned by stakeholders or managers to those threats or risks  
they are most worried about, resulting in an action list.  
311  
# Risk Management Strategies  
The following are the usual strategies discussed in risk management guidelines \(e.g., Silvers  
and O’Toole, 2020; Wynn-Moylan, 2017\).  
Avoidance\: Many threats can be avoided, assuming they are identified and analysed as to their  
probability of occurrence and potential severity. Events can curtail or ban the sale and consump-  
tion of alcohol, or prevent illegal substances from entering the site. If weather is a constant or  
serious threat, an indoor location is preferable. However, many events will opt to accept certain  
risks because of their theme, financial necessity, or confidence in their risk management systems.  
Retention\: If risks are accepted, there are essentially three strategies to deal with them. The  
first is reduction, the second is to take out insurance against losses or legal implications,  
and the third is to self-insure by building up reserve funds. Insurance providers can help in  
the whole process, as they learn the risks and consequences through experience, and some  
have developed specific guidelines that event organisers must follow in order to qualify for  
insurance. Activities and whole events have been cancelled because of the cost or lack of  
insurance. Professional associations and cities have resorted to self-insurance schemes just  
to be able to continue producing events.  
Reduction\: All managers must seek to reduce both the threat and the consequences, as to  
do otherwise might be considered negligence. Some hazards and threats can be minimised  
or kept to an acceptable level through better management, training, operations, or actions  
focused on reducing the potential severity of damage or losses. Diffusion of risks in time and  
space is sometimes possible. Spreading out certain activities can alleviate crowding while  
holding several smaller events is one solution to threats posed by large assemblies.  
Sharing or Transference\: Insurance is one form of transferring risks, but only the financial  
parts. Who is liable for losses or damage is a very big issue for events, and to the extent that 312  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
liability can be shared, or placed as the responsibility of another organisation \(or level of  
government\), the event is better protected. Having guests and customers sign waivers is a  
related strategy, but it does not protect the organisation against negligence.  
# Health and Safety Management  
Health and safety management aims to ensure that all event participants, staff, volunteers, and  
attendees, as well as those externally impacted by an event, are protected from hazards and  
threats. It is people-focused and includes important crowd management and security functions.  
In addition, it should be linked to customer experience design. Detailed consideration is not  
possible in this book, but here is a partial list of items for planning and management\:  
l Fire codes\: prevention, response.  
l Occupational health and safety laws and regulations; working conditions and workers’ rights.  
l Building codes \(regulations, inspections\).  
l Food and water safety standards \(regulations, inspections\).  
l Noise pollution and related decibel limits or time restrictions \(e.g., for loud music\).  
l Waste disposal; hazardous material disposal; recycling.  
l Hygiene \(toilets, showers\).  
l First aid, ambulance services.  
l Comfort \(rest areas, water, meeting points\).  
l Alcohol \(restrictions by area; consumption limits; serving hours\).  
l Animals \(prevention of abuse; rights of people with guide or seeing-eye dogs\).  
l Emergency response; access and egress controls.  
l Pyrotechnics \(fireworks; smoke\).  
Figure 13.2 illustrates three domains of health and safety management, starting with the  
­ psycho-social. Essentially this means events must understand their customers or guests and the  
propensity for health and safety threats that result from motivation and behaviour. As discussed

Figure 13.2 Three Domains of Event Health and Safety Management Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events elsewhere, the contemporary pop music festival is often associated with drugs, alcohol, and  
illicit behaviour. These antecedents can be considered in scenarios and contingency planning.  
Domain two is biomedical, sometimes necessitating the involvement of medical expertise, com-  
bined with crowd management and control. Healthcare specialists want to assess the risks, the  
need for response services, and the ways in which prevention or minimisation can be imple-  
mented. The potential for a major incident is particularly important, including violence and the  
outbreak of serious disease. One important consideration when contemplating the hosting of a  
large-scale event is the host region’s capability to deal with a resulting disaster. Lessons from  
the pandemic have to be made permanent. The third domain is environmental, linked to site  
planning, logistics, the programme, and overall setting. Security systems have to be considered  
as an essential component.  
A review of event safety research was conducted by Vendelo \(2019\), who determined that  
new safety concerns were constantly arising. Recent themes include extreme weather, safety in  
developing countries, sexism, and terrorism.  
313  
# Security  
Some events, by virtue of their symbolic value, size, or nature are more likely targets than  
others. Open and free-access events, where anyone can enter, present many opportunities for  
crime and attacks. Each event must therefore evaluate its attractiveness and vulnerabilities.  
Terrorism and cybercrime as threats have been discussed by Ashwin \(2021\), outlining both  
the factors that contribute to event vulnerability and the counter-measures that can be taken.  
Fundamental actions for event managers include the following\:  
l Electronic surveillance and highly visible police presence.  
l Training of workers and participants to spot and report threats; drills for emergency response.  
l Reducing the potential rewards of attacks \(e.g., money security; dispersal and hardening of  
potential targets\).  
l De-escalation of incidents; elimination of provocations.  
l Background checks on all staff, volunteers, and participants.  
l Unified command, control, and communications system, including external authorities  
\(police, fire, and medical\).  
l Access controls and security checks \(gates; screening; advance warnings\).  
*Layered Security*  
Police and private security companies can advise on the principle of layered security, and  
what exactly is needed for a given event. Redundancy has to be built in, so if one element  
fails there is a backup. While planning for risks, health, and safety, the event’s vulnerabili-  
ties will be identified and appropriate strategies formulated, such as how to prevent a crush  
on the stage, protect guests and performers from attacks, secure money, and keep out drugs  
and alcohol. Four or five D’s are used to describe the components of a layered security  
system.  
Detect\: all workers should be trained in what to look for, such as suspicious people and  
items, but this might also require a surveillance system including closed-circuit television.  
Access controls and searchers of bags, even pat-downs, are the most obvious \(and resented\)  
ways to detect and prevent entry with banned substances or weapons. 314  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
Deter\: Visible police or security personnel are one deterrence, fencing and barriers another.  
It is usual to have a fenced and guarded buffer zone between the audience and the stage.  
Signage is used to provide warnings and prohibitions.  
Delay\: There are ways to slow down or divert potential incidents, such as moving people  
away from trouble spots, erecting temporary barriers, or having staff intervene. Effective  
communication among staff and security is obviously needed, but guests can also be alerted  
through both public address systems and personal media devices.  
Deny\: Take measures to deny access to certain areas, so as to protect both people and assets.  
Keep valuables locked up. Guard VIPs, etc.  
Defend\: This is the hopefully being a physical \(possibly armed\) direct response to attacks.  
*Contingency Planning and Emergency Response*  
A contingency is a possible but unpredictable future occurrence. It might happen, uncertainty  
is present. But since we know of many threats we have to be prepared for at least some of them  
in detail, and all of them in general terms. In other words, events need pertinent policies, pro-  
cedures, and, where possible, rehearsed reactions. In risk management, we want to know both  
the most likely threats to occur, and the most damaging ones. The contingency plan, therefore, is  
based on anticipating the need for reaction – possibly even crisis management – and having the  
strategies and arrangements in place to deal with and recover from the risks.  
One of the most important contingency plans is for an emergency response to a variety of  
immediate threats, such as approaching severe weather, and real-time incidents, such as fires  
or attacks that require evacuation. The need for emergency responders to enter and do their  
jobs is a related issue that must be taken into account at the design stage and will be an import-  
ant element in site and venue planning.  
Detection and Triggers\: Managers must be able to detect a problem before anything can be done  
about it. News, observations, or other indicators of a threat/problem/risk will be used, and  
then a decision can be made on what exactly will trigger the planned response. Weather fore-  
casts can be vague, but monitoring a radar map for approaching severe weather can provide  
adequate warning. This is clearly done at golfing events, leading to sirens and course evac-  
uations. In terms of crowding and potential crushes, what exactly are the warning signs of  
impending disaster? Many threats and risks might not be amenable to advance warning, so  
a specific trigger is needed to get the response implemented. By the time people are being  
crushed, it is too late for prevention.  
Communications\: An emergency broadcast system is necessary in most event settings, otherwise  
direct contact with guests is needed by way of telephone, mass and social media, and signage.  
Communications protocols are required and must be tested to ensure that first responders  
receive timely and accurate news, and they in turn can communicate effectively with all con-  
cerned parties.  
Responsibility and authority\: The chain of command must be established in order to prevent con-  
flicting reactions, and to ensure that legal authority \(such as the police and fire officials\) is  
maintained.  
Immediate response\: Staff and volunteers must practice responses to minor accidents as well  
as serious incidents. Checklists might be necessary, also posted protocols and quick-access  
online documentation. Incident reports are usually required following the first responses. These Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events are intended to defend against lawsuits, plan for future incident responses, and perhaps even  
reassure the injured that it is being taken seriously.

# Crowd Management and Control  
Crowd management refers to all the systems and programming intended to attract, accommo-  
date, and ensure safe, healthy, and rewarding experiences for guests, customers, participants,  
workers, and any others at planned events. Crowd control is one element in this management  
function, consisting of those measures taken in reaction to problems or threats.  
There is a long history of studying crowding within the behavioural sciences, illustrated by Le  
Bon’s \(1908\) study that is the foundation of many of the subsequent analyses of crowding.  
More recent studies such as Wynn-Moylan \(2017\) trace the evolution of thinking on the sci-  
ence of crowding and crowd behaviour pointing to influential studies such as Berlonghi \(1995\)  
on what can cause crowd problems at events. What these studies show is that there are cata-  
lysts that can trigger crowd-level reactions.  
Le Bon \(1908\) stimulated a debate by arguing that through group mind theory it was evident  
that individuals in a crowd lost all sense of responsibility. Many subsequent studies have ques-  
tioned these assertions, suggesting that context is also important in triggering crowd-wide  
behaviours. For example, Wynn-Moylan \(2017\) points to the work of Festinger et al. \(1952\)  
which suggested deindividualisation occurs in crowd settings. This concept suggests that a wider  
range of behaviours may occur, dependent on the context and the individuals involved, that can  
lead in extreme cases to rioting and violence. Other studies have labelled this mob sociology \(e.g.,  
Momboisse, 1967\) suggesting the behaviour is irrational, while Berk \(1974\) suggested that  
crowd action was rational and could be modelled. Subsequent research has shown that crowd  
behaviour is very much based on social identity theory \(see Wynn-Moylan, 2017\) where people  
act in relation to their own identity and in a socially coherent manner.  
Crowd density is an objective measure of how many people there are in a given area, whereas  
crowding is how people feel about the situation. Studies have shown that in wilderness settings,  
even the sight of a few other canoeists is crowding. Although a potential problem at events,  
people often expect crowds, and they can even add to our enjoyment \(Lee et al., 1997; Mowen  
et al., 2003; Wickham and Kerstetter, 2000\).  
Some of a person’s reaction to the presence of others is related to the size of the group and our  
personal space – this is social density \(Bell et al., 2001, 296\), whereas some of it depends on how  
much space there is – that is, spatial density. It is the difference between too many people to  
interact with, versus not enough space. Freedom to move, perceived control, and risks can also  
be factors. For example, what would happen in a panic – can we escape? The context also influ-  
ences our judgement of what is crowding. Researchers have found that males and females are  
equally affected by high social density, but males suffer more from high spatial density. Friends  
and social support mitigate stress or anxiety caused by crowding. Evidence linking crowding  
with aggression or other anti-social behaviour is not clear, especially within event settings.  
Bell et al. \(2001\) compared various theoretical models pertaining to crowding. Critical causes  
of crowding \(not of density, but the resultant feeling\) have been attributed to excessive social 316  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
contact and social stimulation, reduced freedom \(e.g., to move about\), scarcity of resources  
\(bathrooms?\), violations of personal space, unwanted contacts \(groping?\), interference with  
the desired behaviour, and lack of privacy. Possible coping mechanisms for crowding include  
withdrawal, attempts to reduce stimulation/arousal, escape, aggressive behaviour, territorial-  
ity, and other attempts to maintain freedom, control, or privacy. Some of these coping mecha-  
nisms might be desirable even if the crowding is considered to be, overall, unavoidable or fun.  
Cutting across most of these models is the notion of perceived control. If we believe we can  
take control of the situation, the negative impacts will be diminished.  
Freedman’s \(1975\) ‘density-intensity model’ appears to have great relevance to events, although  
it has been controversial. His model suggests that density intensifies reactions that would  
otherwise occur given the particular situation, so that high density heightens the importance  
of other people and magnifies our reactions to them. High density therefore intensifies the  
pleasantness of positive situations \(e.g., a party or celebration\) and intensifies the negativity  
of situations we would rather avoid. Accordingly, your expectations, desires, and mood upon  
entering an event setting will directly impact your reaction to density – whether or not you  
feel crowded. Mowen et al. \(2003\) found that crowding at events is more likely to be a positive  
factor at the entertainment stage, and negative at food and beverage outlets.  
Setting a firm site capacity in terms of the number of people invited or permitted is one way to  
prevent overcrowding and related problems. Similarly, managers can try to regulate the flow  
and turnover of patrons. Other capacity and crowd management techniques include\: advance  
and group ticketing \(to avoid bottlenecks\); physical barriers and activity spacing; information  
provision, and the management of queues \(Mowen et al. 2003\).  
*Dynamic Crowd Management \(DCM\)*  
Technological advances have made it possible to monitor crowds from all angles, plus the set-  
ting \(where attacks might emerge\) in real time. According to O’Toole et al. \(2019\) in the book  
Crowd Management\: Risk, Security and Health,  
Using onsite technology and smart analytic systems, the purpose of DCM is to  
predict, rather than simply react, and therefor prevent crowd-related problems. This  
requires constant measurement of size, movement and crowd characteristics linked  
to environmental conditions. When problems are detected, or better yet anticipated,  
action is required.  
EXPERT OPINION 13.1\: By William J. O’toole  
The Australian Safe and Healthy Crowded Places Handbook  
William O’Toole is an events development specialist \(see www.epms.net and https\://www.  
linkedin.com/in/william-otoole-events\). He wrote the Australian Federal Government’s  
handbook *Safe and Healthy Crowded Places*. The handbook is free online at https\://  
knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/handbook-15-safe-and-healthy-crowded-places/  
As the events sector matures around the world, it undergoes what can be termed  
*phase changes*. The latest change concerns the adoption of risk management. Proof  
of the change is found in the number of public events such as festivals and parades  
that are cancelled due to increased security costs. Reports suggest that the budget for  
security is now 20% of the whole event budget. Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events 317  
For many years governments and departments saw events as a source of income, tour-  
ist attractors, and part of the destination marketing mix. The current focus is for the  
government and its agencies to regard an event as a crowd of people. This latest phase  
is a result of the attacks on public events by terrorists and lone shooters combined  
with the increasing popularity of public festivals and concerts by the new generation.  
The term used is a *temporary mass gathering*. The risk techniques have been adapted  
from other types of mass gatherings such as at airports, shopping centres, and other  
transport hubs. The ongoing management of these venues allowed the management  
team to test and gradually refine their crowd management tools and techniques. With  
the uncertainty of a new disease, Covid-19, the risk of crowds as a mass transmitter  
became a new focus.  
Recognising this change, the Australian Government, through the Australian Institute  
for Disaster Resilience, decided to update its seminal manual on crowds, originally  
published in 1999. Called Safe and Healthy Crowded Places, the project to write the  
new handbook gathered numerous agencies together to hear their concerns and tech-  
niques. The agencies included representatives of all state and federal police, public  
health, ambulance services, city authorities, event companies, and private security com-  
panies. An interesting part of the large project was to discover that, although there are  
so many agencies dealing with events, they all have similar processes and issues. The  
standard risk management process was behind all of them. Many of the incidents and  
issues with crowds could be forecasted. Planning was paramount.  
But there were issues with crowds that arose spontaneously and, even with all the plan-  
ning, could not have been foreseen. First, the issue had to be recognised by the on-site  
event team as a risk. In a complex dynamic entity such as a crowd what seems to  
be a small problem can be quickly amplified by the number of people it affects. This  
introduced the all-important ‘situational awareness’. Then the response teams had to  
use the resources at hand and work rapidly with multiple agencies and volunteers.  
Decision-making had to be decisive using the knowledge available as time was criti-  
cal. The handbook was divided into four main topics\: Crowd Management, Site and  
Safety, Health \(including Public Health and Medical\), and Security. Flowing across these  
domains were the processes found in risk management, communication, and emer-  
gency management. This can be illustrated using the embok block model \(Figure 13.3\).

the three dimensions of domains, processes, and time 318  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
In each of these domains, the agencies had accumulated vast experience and research,  
honed skills, and built heuristics. The problem was that they had developed it inde-  
pendently of each other and created their domain-specific terminology. We needed  
a common handbook that summarised this information from all these agencies and  
domains.  
Dealing with all the agencies and constructing this model led me to realise that there  
was not a body of work that brought the four areas together. It was obvious there was  
a common methodology expressed in very different words. Hence I asked four on-the-  
ground experts to write about crowd management from their perspective. This led to  
the new textbook *Crowd Management\: Risk, Security, and Health.* The textbook uses  
the principles of emergence and complexity to describe the management of crowds.  
Dr Stephen Luke, author of the health section in the textbook, after describing the  
risks of pandemics, wrote the prophetic statement “Why then is health so often an  
after-thought in event planning?” The cancellation of events around the world perfectly  
illustrated the themes of the book\: uncertainty \(as distinct from risk\), exposure, centrali-  
sation of decision-making, complexity, and long tail catastrophic risk. The ­ double-edged  
sword of tourism was evident during the Covid years. Tourism spreads new money and  
also spreads new diseases.  
Dr Andrew Tatrai, highly experienced in crowd management and security described the  
importance of immediate information at an event. Security guards, for example, cannot  
see over the heads of the crowd. This was brought home in the 2022 crowd disaster in  
Korea. His solution is to use existing cameras and an ai system to immediately identify  
possible problems and relay this to the on-the-ground security and police.  
All of the above fits into an events sector maturity model. The development over time  
of individual events, event companies, government strategies, and suppliers are sur-  
prisingly similar in countries around the world. There are internal contradictions and  
external pressures that drive this. Risk is the most recent. Issues at events and require-  
ments from governments have pushed the event sector along the maturity path. Covid  
is a perfect example of a major crisis that created an inflection point and forced govern-  
ments and companies to reassess their event portfolio. This accelerated the next phase  
in the maturity model.

# Crisis Management and Resilience  
One important conclusion arising from the previous sections is that any threat or external situ-  
ation can cause a crisis if the organisation is unprepared or responds poorly. All of which means  
that events must do comprehensive risk management, have contingency plans and emergency  
responses in place, and give serious thought to becoming more resilient.  
In the book Crisis Management and Recovery for Events \(Ziakas, Antchak, and Getz, 2021\) the basic  
elements of recovery planning were discussed, being\:  
l Adequate financial resources \(i.e., are there committed resource providers and reserve funds  
available?\)  
l Committed stakeholders \(Is the event an institution that must be protected, or part of a  
­ valued portfolio? Does it have goodwill within the community, and are politicians support-  
ive? Has it powerful allies and partners?\)  
l Demand \(Has the event a loyal customer base? Can engagement with target segments be  
maintained? Is redesign or repositioning necessary?\)  
l Technical feasibility \(to recover, especially after cancellation, are suitable venues and times  
available? Are staff and volunteers able to return? Can imposed regulations or conditions be  
managed?\)  
Alongside sustainability planning and risk management, specific attention has to be given to  
building resilience through strengthening the organisation’s agile management systems, build-  
ing and maintaining community and stakeholder support, and networking \(preferably within  
managed, collaborating portfolios\).  
Two terms of particular relevance are agile management and adaptability.  
Adaptability\: This is defined as being able to change in profound ways in response to  
­ pressures, threats, or other trends in the environment such as competition, consumer pref-  
erences, or funding shifts. This is in contrast to flexibility, which refers to bending, or mak-  
ing minor changes. Organisational culture is difficult to change, and is therefore often an  
impediment to being able to adapt – thereby lessening resilience.  
Agile management\: To be adaptable requires management systems that are able to respond  
quickly. This is the opposite of rigidity and therefore runs counter to top-down, author-  
itarian decision-making. It fits perfectly with the concepts of a learning organisation,  
­ fostering innovation and intrapreneurship. Events that embody participatory, bottom-up  
decision-making, diffused and situation-specific leadership, and strong stakeholder linkages  
are more likely to be agile.  
Gorchakova and Berdysheva \(2021, 245\) examined the core characteristics of agile ­ management  
for events \(see also expert opinion 4.1\). Staff and volunteers must be knowledgeable, skilled,  
and innovative. Leadership motivates and supports change. The organisation is able to create  
and incorporate new ideas and management systems. Design and programming are responsive,  
as opposed to a product-orientation that focusses on selling a particular ­ experience. Custom-  
ised or individualised products and services define its audience-focused mission.  
*Stakeholders and Crisis Management*  
In times of crisis and recovery, consideration of event stakeholders must intensify. Getz \(2021,  
85\) illustrated five categories that require attention. The model shows four quadrants defined 320  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
by increasing potential for collaboration and assistance on one axis and increasing power, or  
interest and capability of doing harm, on the other. The main point is that events must look to  
those willing and able to help resolve the crisis and facilitate recovery, but also pay attention  
to, and perhaps appease, those that might impede recovery – or actually threaten it. Why would  
some stakeholders seek to harm events in a time of crisis? Potential enemies might include  
protestors, competitors for resources or political support, or those who have been harmed or  
suffered damage by the event \(even if it is only perceived\).  
PROFILE 13.1  
The October 2022 Halloween Disaster in Seoul, Korea  
The final death toll was 145, mostly young people.  
Here are the facts as reported in Korean media\:  
*Crowd Size\:* Only an estimate can be made, as this was an unofficial gathering – a cel-  
ebration by mostly young people of the end of pandemic restrictions, with Halloween  
providing the excuse. The Itaewon district was an obvious gathering point, with its  
bars, clubs, and restaurants holding small events, but the streets became packed with  
up to 100,000 partiers and the police presence \(137 officers\) was there only to look  
for illegal drugs and violent behaviour. There were no controls on the crowd size or  
movements – other than the street pattern itself, and that became a major hazard. In  
hindsight, the crisis should have been anticipated, and it was concluded that the police  
presence and responses were inadequate.  
*The Crisis\:* Police recorded 131 calls for help by 11 pm on the night of the disaster. It  
was reported that a crush had occurred in a narrow alley and people were dying, many  
were desperate for help. Survivors reported that people could not move, they began  
to fall like dominos. At least one person said they saw some men push others. Some  
climbed walls to attempt an escape. There were no exits. An hour and a half went  
by before many were freed from the crush. The police operations centre, set up to  
respond to crises, had remained inactive the entire time leading up to the main crush.  
The fire department had responded, as well as ambulances, but they could not reach  
the victims because of the size and density of the crowd.  
*Aftermath\:* A 74-day inquiry was undertaken by the National Police Agency. It was deter-  
mined that meaningful crowd control measures were not in place on the night in ques-  
tion, despite predictions of a large assembly following the lifting of pandemic-related  
prohibitions. Police had failed to heed warnings from revellers of a swelling crowd, hours  
before the crush. The disaster could have been prevented by employing more police and  
public workers to monitor or block off bottlenecks such as the alley where most people  
died. The subway station could have been closed early to prevent entry to the district.  
One-way walking lanes could have been created. But at the time, there was no way to  
control the scene and ensure that emergency vehicles could quickly reach the victims.  
Criminal charges were laid. The national government minister responsible was  
impeached by his colleagues.  
*Lessons to be learned\:*  
–  
although an informal *happening,* a large crowd was expected in that particular  
district. Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events 321  
–  
although the event was not subject to the normal licensing requirements of  
planned events, the same risk assessment and preventative measures should  
have been applied.  
–  
similar unsanctioned gatherings occur frequently, around the world, especially  
related to sports and at protests – what have the appropriate authorities  
learned?  
–  
the police were clearly not trained or prepared for the potential risks – were  
they the responsible organisation, or the city government? Co-ordination of first  
responders and other emergency services is essential.  
–  
the disaster occurred in a district with many bars and clubs, restaurants, one main  
street, and several narrow alleys; many cities have similar environments – are they  
prepared for worst-case scenarios?  
It is often pointless to distinguish such assemblies from planned events, as the lessons  
should apply to all mass gatherings. There were elements of planning, such as ticketed  
events in clubs, and the celebration was widely advertised and known to be very attrac-  
tive to young people. There were police present, but their numbers and their response  
were woefully inadequate. Emergency vehicles were impeded by the crowd, meaning  
they were not truly prepared for any emergencies. Most importantly, crowd surges  
and crushes are frequent, and the dynamics are so well understood that preventative  
measures and effective responses should be automatic whenever there is an expected  
or planned mass assembly.

# Environmental Management and Sustainability  
Environmental management is a broad function covering all aspects of event planning, operations,  
and clean-up \(or dismantling\) that can impact the natural and built environments. Events  
themselves can be considered to be threats that cause pollution and erosion, contribute to  
climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases, interfere with wildlife, destroy nat-  
ural environments through construction or participant/crowd activities, and impose unwanted  
traffic, light, and noise on communities, or otherwise disrupt the life of residents. In many  
jurisdictions, it is the venue that will be responsible for most environmental management  
issues, while stand-alone events will require their own systems.  
Drawing on Case \(2013\), environmental management for events must consider a number of  
inter-relationships. Case advocated a systems approach, looking at inputs, and transforming  
processes and outputs/outcomes. With a single event as the focus, we therefore must look at  
inputs from, and impacts on the following\:  
l Supply chain \(e.g., infrastructure; food/beverages; energy; water; equipment, etc.\).  
l Venues \(permanent or temporary; indoors or outside; their supply chain and sustainability  
management\).  
l Micro-environment\: the event and immediate surroundings \(e.g., waste; pollution; erosion;  
noise; light; traffic\). 322  
Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events  
l Macro environment \(e.g., carbon emissions, changes in urban, rural, or natural ­ environments;  
alteration of habitat and ecosystems\).  
l Environmental constraints and determinants \(e.g., climate; weather; landscape; policies;  
regulations; and values\).  
l Legacies \(long-term or permanent changes attributable to an event or the event sector\).  
Increasingly it is necessary to consider the events sector as a whole, or at least managed portfo-  
lios, the implication being that cumulative and long-term inter-relationships and impacts must  
be planned and evaluated. Of relevance is Table 13.2 which outlines a sustainability strategy  
for events at the city level.  
Also of importance is the distinction between natural and built environments, both of which  
exist in a spectrum of possible event venues ranging from remote and pristine \(e.g., an  
eco-challenge through wilderness areas\) to major facilities in city centres. Events held in natu-  
ral areas, such as parks and preserves, will almost certainly be subject to intense scrutiny and  
controls, if permitted at all. Major facilities are likely to have permanent environmental man-  
agement systems that apply to all events. Events of different types have specific ­ environmental  
­ management requirements, as well as peculiar impacts related to their supply chain, activities,  
and the people attracted.  
*Nature, Ecological Systems, and the Ecological Footprint of Events*  
Nature and natural environments do occur within urban areas, usually as parks and preserves,  
and any perceived threat to their sanctity is usually met with strong citizen opposition. More  
landscaped and developed parks, such as playgrounds and rest areas, are also highly valued,  
including for their aesthetic attributes. Examples of strong opposition to developing such areas  
for events have been documented, but it is also the case that residents often object to certain  
types of events in their parks, for example, tourist-oriented rather than community-based,  
or they protest against over-use. In these instances, the threats and reasons for opposition  
are clear, and if the events go ahead, amelioration efforts will be required to either protect or  
restore the valued features.  
Ecological systems include all the natural processes that sustain life, including the hydrological  
and energy cycles, climate and weather, wildlife and vegetation populations, and evolution.  
Of greatest concern today is climate change and the necessity for events and tourism to seri-  
ously reduce energy use and related carbon emissions, in fact, to reduce all greenhouse gases  
including water vapour. It is the cumulative impact of many events and related travel that gen-  
erates unacceptable carbon and ecological footprints, although mega-events on their own are  
significant contributors.  
Ecological footprints can be defined as the amount of land and sea area needed to provide the  
resources a person needs and to absorb carbon emissions, expressed in acres or global hectares  
\(source\: www.footprintnetwork.org\). The eco-footprint of an event, or tourism in general, can  
be difficult to calculate, as detailed and area-specific data are required. However, it is known  
what makes the largest contribution, and therefore must be the primary target of greening  
and sustainability strategies. The inescapable conclusion is that travel by all modes should be  
minimised. This runs counter to most tourism strategies and is therefore strongly resisted.  
­ However, until travel becomes clean and green \(that is a long way off, even with the rising  
use of electric vehicles\), as well as all the supporting services \(accommodation, catering, and  
retail\), several strategies should be employed\: Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events l Maximise use of public and mass transit; limit international travel.  
l Reduce the number of visitors, and concentrate on yield per visitor; a small number of  
highly involved tourists who stay longer and spend more, and who travel mostly because of  
the attractiveness of an event, generate the greatest economic benefit; mass tourism is the  
enemy.  
l Adopt all basic greening tools, especially utilising alternative energy, minimising energy and  
water consumption, and reducing all forms of waste.  
l Employ social marketing at events, and in partnership with other stakeholders – especially  
sponsors – to encourage responsible, sustainable practices and to set a good example.  
Carbon calculators are readily available but require a lot of hard data to be useful for events.  
Claims of carbon neutrality should be treated with caution, even cynicism, since in many cases  
the carbon load of an event or venue is simply transferred somewhere else, or takes the form  
of tree planting. Trees are so important that they should not be used as pawns in a game of  
greenwashing.  
323  
*Built Environment*  
Events that require building facilities alter the environment, sometimes permanently. ­ However,  
within urban settings, a range of recreational, entertainment, cultural, and event venues is  
expected and necessary. The legitimation of events means that residents are only likely to have  
objections to the construction of new facilities in cases of over-tourism or over-use, or where  
specific environmental impacts are anticipated. Cost is another matter, especially arousing  
opposition when it comes to mega-events.  
The literature on events and the built environment includes consideration of the range of facili-  
ties supporting events, from streets to small parks and festival sites all the way up to the largest,  
most expensive arenas, stadia, convention/­ exhibition, and arts centres. The larger the city, or its  
significance within regional and national societies \(such as government capitals\) the more likely  
it is that major facilities will be desired, and that fact automatically leads to event development  
and marketing strategies \(e.g., see Plate 13.1\). Employing events within urban development and  
renewal projects, repositioning, or place-branding schemes also gives rise to the need for event  
portfolios. Culture-led development or sport-led development fits into this context.  
*What Is Greening and Sustainability?*  
According to Kellison and Casper \(2018, 136\), “Event-greening is the process of incorporating socially  
and environmentally responsible decision-making into the planning, organisation and implementation of,  
and participation in, an event”. RRR can be a starting point, meaning Reduce, Re-use, and Recycle,  
but greening must also include supply chain management for increased efficiency, reducing  
carbon emissions, protecting ecological systems, and adopting broader sustainability principles  
that become a triple-bottom-line agenda. There is no lack of knowledge about how to green  
events, including that available in books such as by Jones \(2018\). What is difficult to under-  
stand is that in many jurisdictions there is no legal imposition of appropriate regulations, and  
standards are often merely guidelines.  
On the EventImpacts website advice is given on various categories of, and methods for event  
impact assessment. A set of indicators is suggested for environmental sustainability \(source\:

nor does the measurement of those indicators constitute a full ecological impact assessment.  
Sustainable events have to be green – that is a starting point – but they also have to be eco-  
nomically viable, socially responsible, and evaluated with regard to their long-term, cumulative  
impacts.  
Inevitably there will be disagreements about the meaning, process, and evaluation of  
sustainability.  
The term sustainable development was first defined in 1987 through what is commonly known  
as the Brundtland Report, or formally Our Common Future \(1987, n.p.\)\: “Sustainable development is  
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to  
meet their own needs”.  
When this term first became popular, many people in the tourism industry and other sectors  
of the economy believed it meant sustainable growth. That was met with a strong reaction, the  
argument being that a focus on growth is counter to many of the principles of sustainability,  
especially the precautionary principle. Within the events sector, greening became a popular inter-  
pretation of sustainability.  
A more comprehensive approach to sustainable events takes a triple-bottom-line \(TBL\) approach,  
inclusive of economic, social/cultural, and ecological goals and impacts. There are those who  
dislike the term TBL, or its implications, but it is nothing more than a starting point for think-  
ing more broadly and systematically about environmental management and sustainability  
\(Getz, 2009\).  
More recently the term resilience has been added to the sustainability discourse, as the pandemic  
showed that many events could not survive a major shock to their particular ecosystem. Also  
related is the concept of responsibility, the implication being that events \(and all other organisa-  
tions\) have a moral responsibility to do good for society and the environment.  
There are types of events that attract the unsustainable label, including those opposed by  
­ animal-rights groups \(e.g., targeting rodeos\), events that promote harm to nature, foster or  
perpetuate racial or gender-based discrimination or stereotyping, events that encourage vio-  
lence, and events that are exclusive because of their cost or location. What this all means is that  
sustainability has many connotations, and is often politicised.  
Here are some plain, dictionary-type definitions of sustainability and resilience. Note the  
similarities\:  
Sustainability\: the capacity to endure; to maintain a particular process or strategy.  
Resilience\: the capacity to resist, and if necessary recover from shocks or disasters; to  
bounce back when stretched or damaged.  
Given the costs, logistical challenges, political interpretations, and other uncertainties sur-  
rounding sustainability, here is our definition.  
Sustainability is a process of continuous improvement, not an end goal or a  
particular state of being. Being responsible in social, economic, and environmental  
terms, greening events, and being a positive force for change are all elements  
of sustainability that should encourage the setting of ever-higher goals and the  
rigorous evaluation of all processes and outcomes.

*Environmental Management Process*  
Taking a systems approach is necessary to prevent tunnel vision, such as a narrow focus on  
recycling or carbon reduction. Another good starting point is the ISO 21021 Standards for Sus-  
tainable Events Management \(download at www.iso.org\). It lays out procedures for event organ-  
isations to follow in pursuit of a TBL approach to sustainability. These types of standards are  
intended to lead to improved organisation and planning, to prevent or ameliorate negative  
impacts, and maximise desired outcomes. They typically include the following\:  
l Designing a sustainability policy.  
l Issue identification and evaluation.  
l Stakeholder identification and engagement.  
l Objectives, targets, and plans.  
l Performance against principles of sustainable development.  
l Operational controls.  
l Competence and training.  
l Supply chain management.  
l Communication.  
l Monitoring and measurement.  
l Corrective and preventative action.  
l Management system audits.  
l Management review.  
The principles of sustainability described within ISO 21021 are also important. They cover  
integrity, inclusiveness, transparency, and stewardship.  
Stewardship\: This concept is rooted in religion and philosophy, with the basic premise that indi-  
viduals, organisations, and governments have a sacred duty to look after the world’s resources  
so that future generations are not disadvantaged – and preferably advantaged by our efforts.  
As argued by Getz \(2017\) there are three levels of sustainability to consider\: the single event,  
event portfolios, and whole populations of events – all within a sustainable city or destination.  
Planning for sustainability in eventful cities and destinations will require both a supportive envi-  
ronment for planned events in general, and policies specific to event sustainability. Table 13.2  
provides a starting point. Management of overlapping event portfolios will be needed, as there  
are multiple policy domains supporting events for social, economic, and cultural reasons. At the  
city or destination level, there is also a need for standard evaluation and impact assessment  
methods and measures. In addition to creating a supportive environment, events should be con-  
sidered positive agents of change, not merely a field to regulate. Events, in this context, can be  
at the forefront of environmental stewardship and in advocating sustainable practices.  
*Standards, Accreditation, and Awards*  
Numerous systems have been established to guide greening and sustainable event manage-  
ment, certify compliance and thereby accredit events, and award excellence. For example\:  
l A Greener Festival Award is actually a certification system \(http\://agreenerfestival.org\).  
l IMEX-GMIC Innovation in Sustainability Award \(www.imexexhibitions.com/awards/imex-  
awards- programme/green-awards/\). Risk, Health, and Environmental Management for Events 327

STUDY GUIDE  
These vital management functions are packaged in one chapter because of their close interde-  
pendencies. Risk management covers health, safety, and security, a key component of which is  
crowd management. Environmental management is about more than greening and sustainabil-  
ity, it also pertains to environmental hazards. Relate each of these topics to planning, especially  
site planning, and design, as they are all linked. As a useful exercise, compare an indoor venue  
\(say, a convention centre\) with an outdoor festival in terms of the systems in place \(both obvi-  
ous to event-goers, and hidden\) in terms of their management of health, safety, security, and  
environment. Try to find out what those invisible systems are, including their greening policies,  
security measures, and contingency plans. This will require the active cooperation of manag-  
ers. Next time you are at an event, be aware of all that is happening around you, with the aim  
of being vigilant of hazards and threats, conscious of your role in fostering sustainability, and  
how your experience is being shaped by all these management systems. Be critical, and give  
feedback to event producers. With regard to the example of the Seoul Halloween example, as a  
professional, you must ensure such disasters never happen.

# Introduction  
Planned events always have a purpose and goals. This means the planning process has to  
incorporate a system for ensuring that goals are attained, necessitating evaluation and impact  
assessment. It is also possible that unanticipated and negative outcomes are generated, and  
unless evaluators search for them, or receive stakeholder input, they might go unnoticed or  
unmeasured. Internal evaluation by managers, often to solve problems and inform decisions, is  
usually paralleled by external evaluation by stakeholders. The first part of this chapter focusses  
on evaluation, but of necessity also introduces some of the fundamentals of impact assessment.  
There are important differences between routine monitoring and evaluation as a basic manage-  
ment function, both to stay on course and to measure outcomes, and more specific and com-  
plex impact assessments, but there are overlaps. Terminology is important, so we start there.  
# Terminology  
*Outputs, Outcomes, and Impacts*  
To be overly simplistic, an event is a transforming process converting various resources, with the  
help of different stakeholders, into a range of desired outputs\: these could be defined, for exam-  
ple, as attendance, customer satisfaction, profit, or media exposure. Measuring these outputs  
is a necessary internal evaluation mechanism, but keep in mind that external stakeholders are  
also evaluating the event. They are often equally interested in the same output metrics but  
are much more likely to have wider concerns related to sponsor relationships with intended  
customers, how public policy is being implemented, or how particular segments of society feel  
impacted. It is therefore wise to distinguish between short-term and precisely defined outputs,  
and longer-term, broader outcomes or impacts. In this context, we can use outcome and impact  
as synonyms. Keep in mind that people often feel impacted by events, and that is how they use  
the term.  
*Value, Values, Worth, Merit, and Evaluation*  
The root word in evaluation is value, and the literal meaning is to put a value on something or  
determine its worth. A full discussion can be found in Brown et al. \(2015\) and Getz \(2018\).  
Value\: the regard that something is held to deserve \(e.g., “I value my privacy”\); the impor-  
tance of something \(e.g., society values individual human rights\); the usefulness of something  
\(e.g., events are valued as instruments of public policy\); the material or monetary worth of  
something \(e.g., event tourism generates millions in tax revenue\). As a verb, to value or to eval-  
uate means the process of assigning value or worth, although another connotation of evaluate  
is to assess or analyse.  
Values\: important beliefs or ideals shared by individuals or groups about what is good or bad, or  
what has merit \(e.g., “There is a common belief that festivals and events are good for commu-  
nities”\); principles or standards of behaviour \(e.g., “Applying community standards means we  
will not tolerate certain behaviours at the event”\); and judgement as to what is important in  
life \(e.g., “Freedom of artistic and political expression is an essential element of democracy”\). Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment Many different value perspectives can be taken on events, ranging from the instrumental – as  
in event tourism generating new demand and tax revenue – to the position that art festivals  
should be valued without recourse to metrics – they are valued because they are art. You  
can see that values might result in extreme positions sometimes, making them politically  
charged.  
Intrinsic versus extrinsic\: as discussed by Lundberg et al. \(2017\) and Getz \(2018\), some people  
value events intrinsically, meaning they have inherent worth, such as manifestations of culture  
or as healthy pursuits, and they believe we do not need to justify them through measures of  
output or impact. Others employ extrinsic measures of value such as economic impacts or profit/  
revenue generated. Both perspectives can be taken on the same event, reflecting the mandates  
and goals of multiple stakeholders.  
Worth\: Determining the overall worth of an event is therefore a challenge, and realistically this  
can only be done when all the stakeholders agree upon its goals and its effectiveness. In other  
words, the worth of an event or event portfolio will of necessity require negotiation. This prin-  
ciple even applies to individual, for-profit events where the needs and preferences of owners,  
investors, staff, volunteers, participants, suppliers, and others have to be considered. Where  
there is a commercial value \(i.e., it can be sold\), an event’s worth can be determined by valuers  
using various reference points such as recent sales of comparables.  
Merit\: Dual meanings include superior quality or excellence \(e.g., “The tournament merits our  
support because it facilitates the highest level of competition”\); other reasons might lead to a  
similar conclusion, that something deserves praise or approval; Demonstrated ability or achieve-  
ment \(sometimes the evaluator’s task is kept simple\: did we achieve our goals and objectives?\).  
Evaluation of merit can therefore be fraught with danger. Ask\: is that all that should be evalu-  
ated? who set the goals and objectives? whose interests are being served?  
Evaluation\: There are two connotations of evaluation that we need to explore. The first is to put  
a value on something, as in determining its worth. Event venues will have a monetary value, as  
they can be sold in the real estate marketplace, but it is much more difficult to say that an event  
could be sold for a certain amount of money. The real issue is this\: does an event have sufficient  
value to justify the investment of money and effort? Who says so? Do the benefits outweigh  
the costs? The second use of the term evaluation is technical in nature, and sometimes referred  
to as programme evaluation. This is what most managers do when they collect attendance and  
spending data from visitors, assess profit and loss, do market research, or examine the rea-  
sons behind a problem or failure. This form of evaluation is all about supporting the decision-making  
process and solving problems. A permanent, internal evaluation system is required  
for every organisation. We learn from making mistakes and doing research, but only if the  
lessons are incorporated into ongoing planning. Another connotation of programme evaluation is  
to demonstrate cause and effect in such fields as medicine, education, or engineering.  
333  
*Impact Assessment*  
As mentioned, we can equate impacts with outcomes, keeping in mind that people will perceive  
impacts within the frame of their own values, and analysts can try to measure them within the  
context of a planning and evaluation system. The International Association of Impact Assess-  
ment \(IAIA.org\) defines it this way\: “... the process of identifying the future consequences of a current or  
proposed action. The ‘impact’ is the difference between what would happen with the action and what would  
happen without it”. 334  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
That is too narrow a definition for our purposes, but it covers how IA is used in planning and  
feasibility studies. In addition, we will discuss retroactive IA \(what actually happened\), strate-  
gic IA \(evaluating the potential impacts of proposed policies or plans\), and systemic \(i.e., how  
have events changed the ecosystem?\).  
# Theory for Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
The evaluator might begin with the question “What am I to evaluate, and how?”, but the  
more fundamental question is why – which must include consideration of the context and how  
results are to be used. Even more fundamental, and seldom questioned, are the paradigms  
that shape our assumptions and methodologies, ultimately translating into the methods and  
measures being used.  
*Paradigms*  
Evaluation paradigms relate to epistemology and methodology, with paradigm meaning a guiding  
model, a set of concepts, theories, research methods, postulates, and standards that define  
legitimate research and evaluation. As such, they are open to debate. The positivist paradigm is  
widely applied, as it encompasses the search for cause and effect through experimentation and  
quantification. According to Rossi et al. \(2004\), it encompasses many conventional exercises  
such as needs assessment and measures of programme efficiency, to which we can add event-related  
economic impact assessments and measures of customer satisfaction.  
A second important paradigm is called the interpretive \(Potter, 2006\), consisting of methods  
that incorporate stakeholder collaboration in the formulation of the event, setting of its goals  
and objectives, and interpretation of the outcomes. This approach avoids tunnel vision and  
therefore is not used by those wishing to obfuscate or deny projected or real costs and neg-  
ative impacts. It also gives rise to participatory evaluation and IA, wherein affected persons and  
groups are involved in designing the process and interpreting the results. An extension of this  
inclusive approach can be called critical-emancipatory \(Potter, 2006\) and is usually tied to action  
research. The event is an agent of change intended to achieve certain results, and the evaluators  
or IA experts are integrated into the process. Power structures might be challenged, making  
this a controversial paradigm.  
*Complexity*  
Keep in mind that impact assessment and evaluation are often linked. If one merely wishes  
to know if customers are satisfied, that is a fairly simple evaluation question. But if you  
want to know if the cumulative impacts of all events in your city are sustainable, that is an  
evaluation question of great complexity. Getz \(2019a, 29\) developed a model to illustrate how  
political, theoretical, and technical considerations affect the evaluation and impact assessment  
process, resulting in a continuum from simple measurement tasks \(e.g., quantifying our ticket  
sales\) to the extremely difficult evaluation of long-term, cumulative impacts on the environ-  
ment and society. Theory for cumulative impact evaluation in the events sector is not well  
developed \(e.g., what are the long-term impacts of managing a diverse portfolio of events?  
what is a sustainable portfolio?\), the technical requirements would be high \(e.g., original  
research, multi-stakeholder input\) and the political issues complicated \(e.g., many stakeholder  
perspectives on impacts and value need to be accommodated\). Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment 335  
*Purposes and Uses*  
The most basic problem is that many organisations are not able, and in some cases, they are  
prevented from, undertaking many of these tasks – even including basic data collection and  
monitoring. Why? Either a lack of resources prevents research or limits technological means of  
collecting and analysing data, or for political reasons there is a desire to maintain the illusion  
that only benefits are created, there are no negative impacts, and everyone should be happy.  
There also occur misuses of evaluation and impact assessment for the purpose of whitewashing  
or greenwashing – that is, presenting a positive image of an event. This frequently happens when  
narrow interest groups in society want to bid on mega-events and the costs and potential neg-  
ative impacts are deliberately hidden or under-estimated.  
*Theory-Driven Evaluation*  
Theory-driven evaluations start with a theory about how interventions \(i.e., events, portfolios, or  
event-related social marketing\) should achieve certain desired outcomes. In other words, as  
agents of change. Ideally, experiments are used to prove cause and effect, or other evidence of  
success is sought. Educators use this approach to demonstrate how certain didactic methods  
or approaches achieve desired learning results. Medical researchers use this approach to prove  
the efficacy of a new drug or procedure. We hardly ever see true, quasi, or field experiments  
in the realm of planned events, meaning we have no assurances that we can achieve s­ ystem-changing  
results. Each event, even when conceived as an agent of change, could be viewed as  
an experiment.  
*Triple-Bottom-Line and the Balanced Scorecard*  
TBL was a term coined by Elkington \(1994\) to encourage businesses to go beyond economic  
or financial measures of impact and success, specifically to include environmental and social  
factors. It is more of a philosophy than a methodology and has given way to an even broader  
consideration of impacts, including culture, welfare, inclusiveness, human rights, and sustain-  
ability. Similarly, the Balanced Scorecard \(Kaplan and Norton, 1992\) was designed as an inte-  
grated management system and has been modified by Getz \(2018, 65\) for application to events.  
Goals and KPIs are to be established for organisational culture \(including establishment of a  
permanent, comprehensive evaluation system\), customer and stakeholder orientation, internal  
or transforming processes, and sustainability.  
*Goals-driven and Goals-free Evaluations*  
The most common evaluation approach is goals-driven. The evaluator might take the simplest  
approach, asking “Did we achieve our goals?” and conclude that, if yes, the event has merit.  
Evaluation might also focus on only one or a few goals, such as “Did we achieve our revenue  
targets?”, in which case the evaluation is not of the event – it is merely a technical exercise in  
output measurement. The degree of goal attainment is referred to as effectiveness.  
Goals-free evaluation is seldom employed, as it requires a broad mandate and open-ended ques-  
tioning of “what happened, and why?” You can see that this approach requires a lot of resources  
and skills, and can lead in many unpredictable directions. It is intended to avoid the tunnel vision  
that can accompany narrow, technical evaluation exercises – especially the kind that avoids  
looking for unintended and negative outcomes. 336  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
All too often externalities are ignored, such as impacts on those not directly involved in the  
event’s production, or environmental pollution. A full event evaluation takes into account costs  
and benefits and their distribution. In goal-free evaluation no assumptions are made about  
purposes or goals, so evaluators seek to demonstrate what happened, whether intended or  
unintended. Sometimes this approach is taken when long-term, expensive programmes are  
evaluated, such as in health care and education. Government agencies will want to ensure that  
major policies are being implemented effectively and efficiently, plus they want to avoid negative  
impacts in other policy fields.  
Efficiency is defined as the relationship between inputs and outputs, giving rise to the following  
questions\:  
1 “Can we utilize our resources better?….. to achieve more?” \(e.g., do we get the most from  
our staff and volunteers?\).  
2 “Can we do more, or as much, with less?” \(thereby saving money or allowing re-distribution  
of resources\).  
3 “How can we cut waste? How can we use water/energy more wisely?”  
4 “Where/how can we acquire more resources?”  
Numerous ratios exist for evaluating financial or economic efficiency, the most commonly cited  
being Return on Investment \(ROI\). However, the meaning of return is open to interpretation  
and varies with application. For a business, the bottom line will always be profit and financial  
sustainability. Calculating yield per visitor, or for hotels REVPAR \(revenue per available room\)  
are key metrics. Investors will want traditional ROI calculations \(e.g., 5% return per annum\),  
and lenders will want a number of metrics including data on the balance sheet \(revenues versus  
expenditures\) and cash-flow accounts to assure themselves they will get paid back. Tourism  
agencies and destinations will often focus on destination-level metrics such as growth rates  
\(both the volume of tourism and yield per visitor; length of stay; repeat visits/loyalty\), image  
and reputation relative to competitors, and development of infrastructure \(with major events  
being catalysts\) as their ROI. The profitability of individual businesses and events should also  
be considered, but it is not the primary responsibility of tourism organisations.  
ROI for a major event would also depend on the legacy goals, which might include non-­ economic  
measures such as urban renewal, improved infrastructure, and making gains in trade and  
investment. ROE can be used, suggesting that the event organisers are not interested in profit  
\(although they must be financially sustainable\). ROE in this context is used by meeting and  
convention planners who want to know if the event leads to improvements \(see the modified  
Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick model in Figure 9.2\). Service-oriented events need the usual inter-  
nal efficiency ratios that measure their output per unit of expenditure \(or investment\) and a set  
of measures useful to stakeholders – which might include the community at large or specific  
segments who receive benefits. Key performance and impact indicators are needed, ranging in  
complexity from satisfaction to indicators of systemic social/cultural change.  
# Professional Practice  
Codes of practice have been established by professional evaluation and impact assessment  
associations, including the American Evaluation Association \(AEA\) and the International  
Association of Impact Assessment \(IAIA\). There are also available standards that apply to  
professionally conducted evaluations. According to Stufflebeam and Coryn \(2014\), these  
include\: Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment 337  
l Utility \(serve the client’s needs; consider all stakeholder interests; make values explicit\).  
l Feasibility \(efficiently using resources; use project management tools; best methods used\).  
l Propriety \(legal, ethical, respectful; transparent, and full disclosure\).  
l Accuracy \(technically competent; suitable methods\).  
l Accountability \(open to scrutiny; full documentation; standardised methods and measures  
as far as possible\).  
Evaluations and impact assessments are, unfortunately, frequently done unprofessionally, or  
are misused. Too many simply give the client what the client wants, to use for their own pur-  
poses. This includes numerous economic impact studies that exaggerate mega-event benefits  
while ignoring or downplaying costs and potential negative impacts. Call this whitewashing.  
Professionals will avoid pseudo-evaluations that serve purely political or public-relations pur-  
poses and should not enable persons or groups who want to make false claims or provide  
misleading evidence on a given issue. Professionals will need to advise clients and stakeholders  
on what is feasible and how results can be used, as selective use of results can be misleading.  
Furthermore, in this age of climate change and turmoil, professionals should always encourage  
full impact assessments and cost-benefit evaluations from multiple stakeholder perspectives.  
# A Complete Evaluation and IA System  
A complete system for an event has to be fully integrated within other management systems,  
including strategic and project planning, risk assessment, and HR management, as illustrated  
in Figure 14.1. Evaluation and IA should lead to more accurate forecasts and more dependable  
goal attainment.

In addition, evaluation and impact assessment can be conceptualised in four dimensions by  
asking these questions\:  
1 Forecasting\: what will be the impacts/effects/changes if we do the following? \(or do noth-  
ing?\); this question is inherent in all change models and relates to the very purpose of the  
event. By thinking \(perhaps in a group setting\) about the difference between taking action  
and doing nothing, important conclusions might be drawn, such as\: “We have to act, other-  
wise this community will remain divided”.  
2 Post-event\: what were the demonstrable \(or provable\) outputs and outcomes? did we achieve  
our goals?  
3 Systems\: how has the event \(or the entire event portfolio/population\) generated impacts  
\(positive and negative; long-term and cumulative\)? and what does that mean for our  
organisation?  
4 Strategic\: what are the probable impacts of changes to the event ecosystem? \(such as changes  
to funding, regulations, and creation of portfolios\).  
# The Subjects and Objects of Evaluation and IA  
The usual focus of event management is on the guests or customers, and what benefits they  
derive from their experiences. They are the objects of our design and production, and we aim to  
satisfy them. On a deeper level, we might aim to co-create a transforming experience – giving  
rise to the expression return on experience. Other possible objects are groups, organisations, and  
things we intend to impact. When setting goals and considering outcomes, our subjects can be  
social, cultural, economic, or related to the built environment or nature/ecology. Any combina-  
tion of these is possible. If events have the mandate to improve the quality of life of residents,  
then they are all pertinent, but if the mandate is to attract tourists, our subject is primarily  
economics.  
This structure is fully developed in Getz \(2019a\), based on work by Armbrecht and Andersson  
\(2016\). As presented in Table 14.1, there are five subjects and eight objects. Such a matrix can  
be modified to suit different purposes and for more or less specificity. For example, specific tar-  
get segments might be featured, or particular settings. First and foremost, it is a goals-oriented  
system, with impact assessment and evaluation directed towards determining if and how goals  
are attained. Beyond that, evaluators have to be concerned with how to avoid tunnel vision and  
always search for unintended and negative outcomes. Table 14.1 The Subjects and Objects of Evaluation and ia

Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment Impact Assessment Theory and Process  
Although forecasting IA is most common \(as in “What will be the impacts or outcomes of an  
event on the environment?”\), post-event IAs are often conducted for events, most frequently  
regarding economic impacts. IA methods are also needed for retrospective assessments of how  
events and tourism have changed a system \(such as “Has our portfolio of events improved this  
city’s living conditions?”\) and for the assessment of potential impacts of policies or strategies, by  
comparing alternatives.  
Comprehensive impact assessment for events and tourism is rare, being extremely complex to  
conduct, but with the growing number, size, and importance of events – and managed event  
portfolios – an urgent need exists for theoretical and methodological development. IA goes  
hand in hand with evaluation, as there is generally little point in forecasting impacts if outputs  
and outcomes are not monitored and evaluated, and little point in knowing what impacts have  
occurred unless something is done about them.  
341  
*Mitigation*  
We hope to be able to forecast and prove the attainment of our goals, but what do we do  
about negative impacts? Mitigation takes on different forms, and as noted by the United States  
­ Council on Environmental Quality \(1980\), it can include\:  
a Avoidance \(by not doing something\).  
b Actions taken to minimise impacts.  
c Repairing damage \(or rehabilitation\).  
d Reducing or eliminating the undesired outcome over time.  
When all else fails, compensation for losses might be needed. Note the overlaps between ­ mitigation  
and risk management. All planning and all events entail uncertainty about the future, giving  
rise to risks.  
*Evidence and Indicators*  
What evidence is acceptable to demonstrate goal attainment? To be effective means to achieve  
one’s goals, so when goals are set the means for demonstrating goal attainment are an inherent  
part of the process. This requires performance indicators, and the establishment of a method to  
obtain the evidence. Efficiency is also important, meaning how well we use resources to generate  
the intended outputs. Efficiency can be improved by achieving more output for less input, such  
as through productivity gains, reducing costs and waste, or earning more for the same effort.  
All these need indicators, the things to measure that define efficiency and efficiency gains.  
When it comes to events as agents of change, how can we prove that events cause positive or  
negative impacts? We lack a theory that both explains and predicts all potential outcomes, so  
we are left with compiling evidence and arguing our conclusions, often in a confrontational  
setting – such as the typical political debates surrounding the advantages and disadvantages of  
mega-events. If all stakeholders can agree upon the goals and related performance and impact  
indicators, then agree upon methods and measures, impact assessment and evaluation will be  
easier. What evidence will be accepted by stakeholders is in all likelihood a matter of debate  
and compromise. Some will want hard numbers only, especially when it comes to economic  
impacts, while others will be satisfied with hearing the voices of those people and groups who  
feel they have been impacted. 342  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
# The Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response Model  
This model is adaptable to event impact assessment, and although we do not always have  
theory to prove cause and effect, if we understand the forces and pressures at work there  
is a better chance for goal attainment and avoiding negative impacts. Pressure refers to the  
ways in which events, venues, and tourism can cause change. Remember that we conceptualise  
planned events as agents of change. These pressures include investment in event venues, event  
production and activities, event tourism, and even media coverage can have an impact. Some  
pressures are rather obvious, such as increased traffic, while others are more subtle and open to  
interpretation, such as the role of media coverage in shifting resident attitudes, or how events  
generate social capital.  
When events are viewed as agents of change, the state of the environment, society, culture, and  
economy is pulled into focus. However, these are all dynamic systems, so establishing a bench-  
mark to assess before and after conditions is often difficult. When assessing impacts we need  
to consider if we are making forecasts, looking back at trends, or weighing options. To complete  
the model it is necessary to evaluate how people and institutions react to impacts, as the very  
act of doing an IA or evaluation should lead to changes.  
Table 14.2 provides an example. A range of forces or pressures is indicated, along with possible  
impacts and responses. These are intended to show how to develop and use this type of model,  
as it cannot be comprehensive. Each force or pressure can also be disaggregated, such as for  
stages of construction.  
*Leopold Matrix*  
The objects-subjects matrix is a useful framework at a general level, but in IA forecasting or  
post-event IA, a more refined matrix is often utilised. While the subjects and objects approach  
can shape an IA matrix, it is designed to include more detailed information. The Leopold Matrix  
\(Leopold et al., 1971\) is often employed, or some variation of it. It was intended to examine the  
possible or observed impacts on environmental conditions \(i.e., physical and chemical charac-  
teristics, biological conditions, cultural factors, ecological relationships\) and actions that might  
cause \(or might have caused\) impacts. The information has to come from past experience, case  
studies, comparisons, theories, or consultations.  
In examining the potential environmental impacts of constructing a new arena for major sport  
events, we need to consider whether the planning, design, construction, and operation phases  
will have an impact on the economy, community, or natural systems. Previous experience will  
certainly provide a starting checklist for the matrix, and so will stakeholder consultations.  
Different kinds of information can be placed in each cell, such as the estimated probability and  
severity of a forecast impact, or the observed amount of pollution if that information is avail-  
able in a post-project IA. Opinions can be added, even as simple as a checkmark or X to indicate  
that residents, through consultation, are concerned about a particular potential consequence.  
# Social Outcomes and IA  
Social-outcome goals are typically made for individuals or families, communities, groups, and  
nations, but we should also examine impacts on businesses, tourism, destinations, politics,  
government, and the events themselves. The challenge is two-fold\: \(a\) provide logic or theory  
of change models that guide the attainment of these goals, and \(b\) employ valid and reliable Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment 343

methods and measures to assess and evaluate impacts - positive or negative, intended and

also leads to theory development. Each logic or theory of change \(TOC\) model is somewhat of  
an experiment designed to test certain hypotheses or informed ideas about what will happen  
when events are held, especially when events and tourism are conceived as agents of change.  
See Richards et al. \(2013\) on social impact assessment, and Getz \(2019a\) on methods and  
measures for SIA. 344  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
*Social Pressures and Responses*  
What exactly causes social change is the question at the heart of both planning a logic or TOC  
model, and in IA. There can be general pressures beyond anyone’s control that have to be con-  
sidered, such as globalisation, forms of government, cultural norms, or the state of the econ-  
omy, but mostly we will be interested in the event-specific stressors and how to analyse them  
within a TOC or an IA matrix. Residents, and host communities, experience both direct and  
indirect event-related stressors. These include changes to the physical environment \(e.g., traf-  
fic, noise, pollution, transport, and infrastructure\), to the economy \(employment, taxes\), and  
to government, and politics \(protests, policies, and strategy\). Residents can decide if they want  
to attend events, with more choices for entertainment creating a utility value, or they might  
appreciate events for what they do in the community – this being a non-use value assigned  
to events. With events designed as agents of change, there is the necessity for specifying the  
intended consequences, measuring them in ways acceptable to stakeholders, and then taking  
appropriate action \(e.g., mitigation of negative outcomes or reinforcement of positive impacts\).  
In many cases the results of event-related stressors, and what to do about outcomes, will be  
open to debate.  
*Personal and Family Outcomes*  
If we only want to find out if customers and guests at events are satisfied, that is a simple eval-  
uation problem. We can use Importance-Performance questions, thereby learning more about  
expectations and quality perceptions. Path analysis can be used, with appropriate data, to link  
antecedents, experiences, and future intentions or loyalty. But none of these evaluation techniques  
answer a fundamental question – do events change people? If events are expected to transform  
visitors, or perhaps other participants and families as well, then some theory must be applicable.  
We can hypothesise, as is being done by researchers who will be cited, that real change, or trans-  
formation, can occur as a result of one or more of the following – singly or in concert.  
Activity\: Especially in sports, we can expect physical and mental benefits, and this can be aug-  
mented by the development of serious leisure and event travel careers.  
Emotional Engagement\: Especially within a festive context, communitas can be fostered. This  
belonging and sharing experienced by equals in an inclusive setting can foster happiness, quality  
of life improvements, or spiritual growth. Even simple entertainment can act as a stress reliever.  
Social Engagement\: Personal and social identity can be fostered or reinforced through social-  
world activities, or events that otherwise bring diverse people together. Social inclusion can  
ideally foster community-level benefits or social capital. Quality of life gains can be expected  
from family togetherness at events \(Jepson and Stadler, 2017\), while hosts and guests can  
meet as equals and gain mutual understanding. Sub-culture or social-world groups can seek  
legitimation. Hixson \(2014\) determined that the more young people participated in a festival,  
the greater their identity awareness.  
Volunteer engagement or work can lead to networking and career benefits, or satisfy personal  
needs for belonging and giving. Doherty \(2009\) employed social exchange theory to examine  
event volunteers and concluded that their intentions for future volunteering were influenced  
by experienced benefits of the event, including social enrichment, community contribution,  
and a positive life experience. This and other studies of event volunteers link specifically to  
volunteering as serious leisure. Hallmann et al. \(2023\) linked serious leisure volunteering with  
the development of social capital. Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment Cognitive Engagement\: If people set out to learn, or get inspired to learn through event program-  
ming, attitudes and behaviour might consequently change. This is part of the rationale behind  
social marketing as well as a great deal of sponsorship or live-experience marketing by corpora-  
tions. Cultural capital can be gained through improved knowledge and networking.  
Inspirational Effects\: Often cited as a justification for sport events, there is in fact little evi-  
dence to suggest that people get more involved or healthier as a result of being exposed to  
sport events or elite athletes \(Ramchandani et al., 2017; Sousa-Mast et al., 2013; Weed, 2018\).  
Weed \(2018, 93\) concluded that the accumulating evidence of sport mega-events did not affect  
sport participation or attract new people into sports. With appropriate leveraging, however, the  
inspiration effect might encourage a higher level of activity among participants.  
Regarding other types of events, it can be suggested that festival engagement can have trans-  
formational impacts on individuals or communities \(see below\), and participation in business,  
scientific, or incentive events might lead to changes in skill and attitude \(see the Kirkpatrick  
and Kirkpatrick model\).  
Kitchen and Filep \(2019\) argued that insufficient attention has been given to the psycholog-  
ical outcomes of events for attendees, all of which link to well-being. They elaborated upon  
self-identity, positive emotions, and a sense of belonging. They described flourishing as an over-  
all sense of psychological fulfilment and said it is central to understanding well-being.  
345  
*Social Impact Scales*  
Research and theory development regarding social impacts has led to a large body of literature  
that documents perceived positives and negatives \(and grey areas\), attitudes towards events  
and event tourism, and theories of how impacts occur. A well-established theme has been a  
focus on resident perceptions of event impacts, both as event participants and general impacts  
on their communities. This led to the development and subsequent testing of social impact  
scales. The following are some key references on this line of research\: Fredline and Faulkner  
\(1998, 2000b, 2002a\); Delamere, and Delamere et al. \(2001\); Fredline et al. \(2003\); Small  
et al. \(2005\); Fredline \(2006\); Deery and Jago \(2010\); Yang et al. \(2010\); Lorde et al. \(2011\);  
Pavlukovic et al. \(2017\), Wallstam et al. \(2018\); Chi et al. \(2018\); and Scholtz et al. \(2019\).  
The paper by Fredline et al. \(2013\) represents a rare case of longitudinal analysis of perceived  
social impacts surrounding an event.  
From the published research, we can identify potential costs and benefits of events for individ-  
uals and communities, but it is also inevitable that local variations will occur.  
*Social Exchange Theory*  
Social exchange theory has been a foundation for many social impact studies \(Fredline et al.,  
2013\), including a study of the Olympics by Waitt \(2003\). Gursoy and Kendall \(2006\) con-  
cluded that resident support for the Olympics relied heavily on perceived benefits, confirming  
the social exchange theory. The basic principle of this theory is that reciprocity is sought in  
human relationships, whether they be economic or social in nature, and therefore if people  
perceive they gain more from events and tourism than they lose, directly or indirectly, they  
are more likely to hold positive perceptions of impacts and positive attitudes towards bidding  
on and holding events in their communities. Other researchers have found that support for  
mega-events varies over time, and a sampling of public opinion after an event will likely reveal a  
lowered impression of benefits. Euphoria and heavy political support beforehand will persuade 346  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
many people that the event is worthwhile, but afterwards they look for benefits that might not  
have accrued \(Mihalik, 2001\). Lorde et al. \(2011\) found significant differences between pre and  
post-event perceptions of impacts.  
*Social Representation Theory*  
Social representation theory has also been suggested for the study of impacts and change  
\(Pearce et al., 1996\). In this construct, it cannot be assumed that people rationally assess the  
costs and benefits of events or tourism, and they hold representations of these objects based on  
personal experience and media coverage. The role of media in shaping discourse surrounding  
mega-events in particular has been identified as an issue, with both proponents and opponents  
attempting to frame convincing arguments through mass and social media. Waitt’s \(2004\) crit-  
ical examination of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games provides an example of how ‘civic booster-  
ism’ was employed to create a dominant, positive representation of the Games, and to exclude  
or silence its critics. While the Games were used to reposition Sydney in the world context,  
they also had to be sold to the population through the exploitation of Olympic symbolism and  
rhetoric, and through promises of major, lasting benefits. Event Bidding \(2017\) by McGillivray  
and Turner documents how mega-event bids are both sold and resisted.  
*Negative Social Impacts*  
It is possible to predict many possible negative impacts on persons, groups, and communities  
with the research evidence readily available. In general, the bigger the event the more likely that  
negative impacts will occur. The first comprehensive study of event impacts \(Adelaide’s Grand  
Prix, by Burns et al., 1986\) examined how residents were affected in their homes and while  
conducting their normal business, such as by increased commuting times. Accident rates were  
also analysed, revealing a so-called ‘hoon effect’ attributed to the atmosphere of the races and the  
nature of those attracted to them. Hall \(1992\) noted that major events, particularly those with  
global media coverage, tend to attract potentially violent protests and political demonstrations.  
Indeed, security has become a dominant theme in event management, and the costs are a deter-  
rent to bidding and hosting major events. A fascinating account of a special event gone wrong  
was provided by Cunneen and Lynch \(1988\). They described how the annual Australian Grand  
Prix Motorcycle Races had become the scene for institutionalised rioting, despite, or perhaps  
because of, the efforts of organisers and police to control crowd behaviour. After some time,  
people came for the riots rather than the races.  
Zawadzki \(2022\) compared the public’s valuation of mega and non-mega sport events on social  
impacts, employing willingness-to-pay measures, and determined that smaller sport events  
offered as much perceived value, for lower costs. Mair et al. \(2023\) reviewed the literature on the  
social costs and benefits of mega-events, leading to the recommendation of a research agenda.  
Refer to Expert Opinion 3.1 by Adam Talbot on sport mega-events and human rights, and  
Expert Opinion 15.1 by Michael Duignan on over-tourism for additional insights.  
*Social Capital*  
Social and cultural capital are addressed again in Chapter 16, where background theory is  
provided.  
Social capital has become an important theme in event research and theory development, with  
examples being\: Arcodia and Whitford \(2006\); Finkel \(2010\); Pernecky \(2013\); Schulenkorf, Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment Thomson, and Schlenker \(2011\); Wilks \(2011\); Jamieson \(2014\); Stevenson \(2016\); Mair and  
Duffy \(2018\). The book Exploring the Social Impacts of Events \(Richards et al., 2013\) focuses on  
social capital.  
Misener and Mason \(2006\) concluded that hosting sporting events offers opportunities for gener-  
ating social capital and community development through building community networks related  
to events. Arai and Pedlar \(2003, 185\) believed that public celebrations and other community  
gatherings engender social capital through enhanced social cohesion, trust, mutuality, coopera-  
tion, and openness. According to the Social Capital Research website \(www.socialcapitalresearch.  
com\) the measurement of social capital, being a complex and debatable construct, has often uti-  
lised single indicators like trust, or indices combining a number of indicators. It was argued that  
three dimensions should be evaluated, each with appropriate indicators. The Structural Dimension  
is mostly about building trust and fostering civic engagement and collaboration networks. The  
Relational Dimension includes social cohesion and networks, emphasising bonding, bridging, and  
linking relationships. The Cognitive Dimension also includes trust, along with norms and values.

# Cultural Outcomes and IA  
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation \(UNESCO, 2002\)  
defined culture as “the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society  
or a social group, and that it encompasses, in addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of living together,  
value systems, traditions and beliefs”. The term heritage is also relevant, and many festivals and  
events fall into the category of intangible heritage.  
Festivals in particular are generally viewed as being expressions of culture, but the same could be  
said about all types of events – they reflect values and traditions and communicate important sym-  
bols. One of the most recurrent themes is the contention that tourism and other forms of com-  
mercial exploitation are harmful to cultural authenticity and can result in negative cultural change.  
*Demonstration Effects and Commodification*  
To the degree that events generate tourism, then direct and indirect interactions between hosts  
\(residents\) and guests \(tourists\) will result. Many social scientists have argued that tourism in  
general is a destructive force in cultural terms, and that cultural events in particular are easily  
commodified as tourist attractions. Many authors have worried about the negative influence  
of tourism on traditional cultures \(e.g., Greenwood, 1972; Jordan, 1980; Wilson and Udall,  
1982\). Often these effects are most visible in the area of cultural productions such as rituals,  
music, dance, and festivals, particularly those that incorporate traditional costumes. Residents  
of destination areas quickly learn that culture can become a commodity for which tourists will  
pay a great amount, resulting in either the transformation of occasional, sometimes sacred  
events into regular performances, or the modification of rituals into forms of entertainment  
that are easier to perform, or please the audiences more. In both cases, the rewards become  
monetary and divorced from their cultural meanings.  
However, there is little agreement on tourism being bad for cultural events, or on how and why  
negative impacts occur \(see, for example, Getz, 1998b; Macnaught, 1982; Noronha, 1977\).  
Some authors have argued that tourism actually helps to preserve or revive traditions and  
strengthen indigenous cultures \(e.g., Boissevain, 1979; Cheska, 1981\), and events are one of  
the most common mechanisms. Sofield \(1991\) examined a successful, traditional event in the  
South Pacific and drew conclusions regarding the analysis and attainment of sustainability for  
indigenous cultural tourism developments. 348  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
Shaw and Williams \(2004, 175\) modelled ‘stages in cultural commodification’ for festivals and  
events affected by tourism, arguing that commodification was part of consumer culture, that  
commodification and consumerism lead to dependency in tourist destination areas, and that  
the commodification of social and ritual events leads to “an erosion of meaning, accompanied by  
community fragmentation”. The stages are\:  
l Independent travellers take an interest in local events; they observe, but do not necessarily  
understand the meanings.  
l Growth in organised tourism occurs.  
l Tour operators market local culture as an attraction.  
l Events become staged for tourists, leading to a loss of meaning for local people \(the event is  
a commodity\) and tourists are observing pseudo-events.  
*Methods for Cultural IA*  
Columbo’s \(2016, 10\) model is specifically designed for assessing the cultural impacts of  
events. Her approach is  
….Based on the perceptions of individuals from a host society, and therefore the  
results are based on subjective and personal perceptions. Thus individual perceptions  
are the most appropriate indicator by which to measure cultural impacts, since these  
impacts, due to their specific characteristics, are more subjective than other impacts  
such as the economic ones.  
Columbo \(2016, 3\)  
Columbo listed potential benefits and negatives that should be examined, provided indicators  
for each, and advocated a method for obtaining resident input on the following\:  
l Perceived or not\: yes it is a likely/existing impact, no it is not.  
l Considered positive or negative\: this can be from the individual’s or community’s perspective.  
l The intensity of the impact on individuals and on the community is evaluated\: \(on an intensity scale,  
say from 1 to 10\).  
l Considered intentional or not\: The evaluator could ask respondents if they think an impact was  
intentional or not, or draw this inclusion from the event organisers or observation and doc-  
ument review.  
# Built Environment Outcomes and IA  
It is useful to distinguish between nature and ecological processes on the one hand, and the  
built environment on the other. By built environment, we mean residential neighbourhoods, cit-  
ies, landscapes modified for agriculture and industrial activities, and all the infrastructure that  
keeps these systems going. We need spaces in which to hold events, and in doing so we create  
meaningful places.  
*Urban Development and Renewal*  
Mules \(1993\) examined how a special event was designed to draw people within the context  
of urban renewal and to change the image so that the area would become associated with lei-  
sure and tourism. Events as instruments of urban policy have become very widespread, with a Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment number of researchers exploring related themes\: Essex and Chalkley \(1998\); Sadd \(2010\); Xie  
and Gu \(2015\); Pacione \(2012\); Rogerson \(2016\). Mega-events create special issues, and they  
are often justified in part by their role in reshaping and renewing urban environments. The  
common negative impacts associated with massive construction projects are housing displace-  
ment, especially of the poor, and the gentrification of areas so that only the rich can afford to  
live in the renewed areas. The equity issues and opportunity costs associated with new venues,  
and especially mega-events, are often ignored. One question that should always be asked is  
this\: are residents, and those with special needs, the ones who will benefit from new venues  
and re-development?  
349  
*Place Making, Identity, and Attachment; Civic Pride*  
Richards \(2017, 12\) examined the various elements in place making, arguing that  
…Cities and regions need to think about events in much broader terms than simply  
economic or image impacts. To have a placemaking effect, events also need to add to  
the meaning of the location, and creativity needs to be employed to ensure that the  
meanings develop are embedded in place and appropriate to the needs and capacities  
of the city or region.  
The existence of events, and engagement with them, can foster a sense of place and help shape  
the community’s identity as perceived by residents. Place making and identity building occur  
when residents are encouraged to participate, attend, and support events that first and fore-  
most benefit locals, but it can also be combined with developing a positive image for external  
influence. When people hold positive attitudes about their place in a community or country, or  
feel pride in being citizens, they are more likely to feel an attachment that is difficult to shed.  
Creative city and re-positioning strategies therefore use events as instruments of policy.  
*Place Marketing and Branding*  
Cities and towns often seek to attract tourists, investment, and possibly in-migrants. Events  
play several roles, as do venues, and improvements in quality of life in general are important.  
Developing a strong and appealing city or destination brand is essential, and the process of  
place branding can be considered an exercise in stakeholder collaboration, or value co-creation.  
Chalip and Costa \(2006\) examined event and destination co-branding and the roles of sports  
events in the destination event portfolio. The creation of the brand is more than names, logos,  
symbols, or images, but how all of these meaningfully combine in a mental schema. Wang and  
Jin \(2019\) examined the roles of mega-events in destination marketing and developed a model  
for event-based destination marketing.  
Consider how the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo \(Plate 14.1\) is co-branded with the city, and  
how it contributes to the local economy by utilising an iconic castle. That event consistently  
attracts more dedicated event tourists than most other Scottish events, and the tourists \(often  
on coach tours\) tend to travel elsewhere in the country pre- or post-Tattoo.  
*Use and Abuse of Public Places*  
The animation of public and private spaces with events may be positive, but there can also be  
a downside. Smith \(201; 2017\) discusses the urbanisation of events when public space is both  
“performed and consumed”. Who gains and who loses is an equity issue, and this is especially 350  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment

poignant when peaceful parks are removed from residents’ control or use. Jones \(2020\) looked  
at cultural mega-events and their relationship to heritage, saying they can figure important  
in the development of small to medium cities. Usually, they are a full year in length, such  
as ­ cultural capital designations, and Jones argued they can be embedded in the community,  
involve many stakeholders, and generate a strong ‘felt presence’ during and post-event.  
# Ecological Impact Assessment  
An EIA has to encompass all the greening indicators and much more. In addition to consump-  
tion, emissions, and waste generated directly by events, demand by event tourism and the  
entire supply chain must be considered. Direct and indirect effects on wildlife, habitat, water  
and drainage, soils, and vegetation must be analysed, as well as noise, light, vibrations, and  
other ambient conditions. The EIA might even be extended to cover the potential impacts of  
new or displaced businesses and related supply chain activity. The most obvious pressures will  
arise from construction and subsequent traffic and activity. If events are conceived as agents  
of change, as in fostering environmental responsibility, then social marketing ­ evaluation is  
required. Although conducting an EIA is in most countries standardised by regulation, it  
is usually only done for major projects. Under European Union directives, an EIA must provide  
information in seven key areas\:  
1 Description of the project or event\:  
–  
breakdown into key components, i.e., construction, operations, decommissioning.  
–  
for each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance. Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment –  
for each component, all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., air pollution, noise,  
hydrology.  
2 Alternatives considered\:  
–  
e.g., other possible locations; for energy, can wind or solar power be used?  
–  
opportunity costs\: what are the alternatives to the event or venue?  
3 Description of the environment\:  
–  
list all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development, correspond-  
ing with elements of the project, in a matrix.  
–  
what are the most likely impacts of the construction? of events? of related traffic and  
visitor activities? what are likely cumulative impacts?  
–  
consultations should reveal existing issues, fears, and potential impacts.  
4 Description of the significant effects on the environment\:  
–  
‘significant’ must be defined by experts, stakeholders, and through consultations; scales  
can be used to indicate severity, perceived importance, and duration.  
5 Mitigation\:  
–  
analyse potential ways to avoid or otherwise ameliorate negative impacts.  
–  
consider how events can be moved in space and time, adopt green standards, limit atten-  
dance or types of activity, incorporate educational and social marketing campaigns, and  
raise money for conservation.  
6 Non-technical summary\:  
–  
the EIA is in the public domain and is to be used in the decision-making process.  
7 Lack of know-how/technical difficulties\:  
–  
this section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge; it can be used to focus on  
areas of future research.  
351  
*Carbon Calculators and The Ecological Footprint of Events*  
Carbon calculators are available online.  
The website greeneventbook \(http\://www.greeneventbook.com/event-carbon-­ footprint-possible/\)  
discusses these issues as well as the meaning of carbon offsetting and neutrality.  
The most important method of reducing the carbon emissions of events is to reduce private  
automobile use, but there remains a serious issue when it comes to event tourism - it cannot  
occur without substantial emissions from fossil fuels. That dilemma will not be resolved until  
alternative, clean energy sources become widespread.  
The ecological footprint is an attempt to quantify the total demand that people or specific activ-  
ities like an event make on the earth’s resources, thereby demonstrating how natural capital is  
being depleted \(Wackernagel and Rees, 1996\). The idea is that an event consumes resources  
and generates wastes that can be converted through a calculator into an area of productive land  
and water necessary to produce the resources and assimilate the wastes.  
Models for calculating the ecological footprint are not widely available, and they have to be  
customised for particular countries and regions. Collins et al. \(2009\) employed this method  
in a study of football and found that more than half of the event’s footprint was generated by  
the travel of 73,000 attendees \(totalling two million kilometres\); consumption of food was  
the second-largest contributor. Andersson and Lundberg \(2013\), Andersson, Jutbring and 352  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
Lundberg \(2013\), and Andersson, Armbrecht, and Lundberg \(2016\) have reported on their  
use in Sweden. If a carbon calculator is available, it can form the basis of a short-cut footprint  
analysis. The nature of the event and its setting will dictate what other indicators should form  
the composite index of ecological impact. For events held indoors, key indicators will include  
energy consumed, the volume and types of wastes and emissions, and of course the number of  
visitors, and how they travelled.  
# Economic Impact Assessment  
Economic impacts tend to dominate the event tourism literature, as events are viewed as  
instruments of development. The logic and related issues are discussed in Chapter 15 on Event  
Tourism. The how-to of generating desired economic impacts from events is well understood,  
and we know that benefits can be realised from rational development strategies. Appropriate  
methods are available for impact assessment and obtaining the necessary data is not difficult.  
But rational planning continues to be shunned and calls for transparency and accountability  
are disregarded when it comes to the policies and actions of many politicians and governments  
around the world – especially regarding mega-events.  
Dwyer et al. \(2010\) argued that economic impacts do not equal economic benefits. Proponents  
of large events often point to the jobs that will be created and the value of tourism that will  
be facilitated, while ignoring negative impacts, costs and opportunity costs, especially equity  
issues that arise when the distribution of costs and benefits is evaluated. If debt is incurred, it  
is passed on to future generations.  
*Legacy and Leveraging*  
Legacy was defined by Preuss \(2007, 211\) as “...all planned and unplanned, positive and negative, tan-  
gible and intangible structures created for and by a sport event that remain longer than the event itself”. The  
structures consist of\: infrastructure \(where the most money is spent, on facilities and transporta-  
tion improvements; and urban renewal\); knowledge \(skill development and education, especially  
among volunteers\); image \(including place branding and obtaining favourable media coverage\);  
networks \(pertaining to trade and business development, attracting conferences and exhibitions  
before, during and after, and developing new stakeholder links\); and emotion \(e.g., national pride  
and the feel-good effect among residents, which might also be thought of as propaganda\).  
Event leverage has been defined as “...activities that need to be undertaken around the event itself, which  
seeks to maximise long-term benefits from events” \(Chalip, 2004, 228\). As such, the event acts as a  
resource or catalyst from which other benefits can be leveraged \(Smith, 2014\). The concept of  
event leverage signals a paradigm shift from event thinking focussed primarily on the impacts  
of events, and post hoc event evaluations, or what is commonly referred to as event legacy  
\(Preuss, 2007; Smith, 2014\). This new paradigm encourages event planners and researchers  
to plan for and identify targeted strategies and tactics that are effective in catalysing specified  
outcomes \(Chalip, 2006; Clark and Misener, 2015\).  
Chalip \(2018\) argued that too much emphasis has been placed on legacy as tangible outcomes  
of hosting events, rather than on the mechanisms by which events can be used to leverage  
economic, social, or environmental change. Ziakas’s \(2014\) review of mega-event leveraging  
derived a list of key research themes for further study, namely\:  
l Equity and sustainability\: ensure that distributional justice is achieved; through triple-­ bottom-  
line accounting the outcomes might be better distributed. Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment l Social capital and diversity\: mega-events can be used to transfer social capital to more civic  
gatherings and bridge the gaps within communities around diversity.  
l An ability to accommodate a diversity of meanings associated with the event and to transcend  
divisions across borders.  
l Localisation of leveraging benefits and capacity building, to grow the collaboration and ability of  
the area to host such events by harnessing the latent potential through collaboration and  
coordination.  
Researchers often question the whole notion of legacy, believing it to be more of a rubric to sell  
people on bidding or convince them of illusory benefits while hiding true costs. Bocarro, Byers,  
and Carter \(2018, 7\) concluded\: “Our findings reveal that research on mega event legacy, both sporting  
and non-sporting, has been underpinned by a commercial ideology that perpetuates the justification of mega  
events through the measurement of legacy”. Their review of legacy-related research revealed five key  
themes\: mostly it has concerned the Olympics and World Cup; it has been mostly conceptual,  
not empirical in nature, and narrowly focussed on single types of legacy. The short time frame,  
rarely more than five years has been a limitation. There have been other studies of world expo-  
sitions \(Expos\) and Cultural events that should also be considered, and some confusion with  
the study of permanent hallmark events such as Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  
With its Agenda 2020 and New Norm, the IOC now requires bid candidates to look into seven  
types of legacies to develop their legacy vision and planning \(International Olympic Commit-  
tee, 2017c\)\:  
l Culture and creative development.  
l Environment enhancement.  
l Economic value and brand equity.  
l Human skills, networks, and innovation.  
l Organised sports development.  
l Social development through sport.  
l Urban development.  
To trace the development of these interrelated concepts we have to cite very early research and  
publications in the event tourism literature. Getz \(1984\) coined the term social multiplier to com-  
plement the economic multiplier, describing events as a mechanism for encouraging communities  
to think about their tourism product and then undertake more comprehensive tourism plan-  
ning. It was argued that community-run events could be thought of as community development  
projects that increase investment in social infrastructure. Furthermore, the social and economic  
development processes should be mutually reinforcing and balanced. This was very much in  
line with the 1980s thinking on community-based tourism planning, as articulated by Murphy  
\(1985\). Getz \(1984, 147\) provided a detailed set of sample goals and objectives for event tour-  
ism including those for mega-events. They encompassed “image enhancement, foreign tourist influx  
and spending, facility and monetary legacy, enhanced pride and confidence, heightened interest in the theme”.  
Legacy was also explicitly discussed by Ritchie \(1984\) in the context of hallmark events. He  
noted that legacies are not necessarily positive or negative. For discussions of various event  
legacies, see\: Andersson et al. \(1999\), Blackman et al. \(2017\), Bodin and Taks \(2022\), Brittain  
et al. \(2018\), Getz \(1999\), Hall \(1994\), Kirby and Crabb \(2019\), Macrae \(2017\), Malhado  
et al. \(2017\), McGillivray and Turner \(2017\), Moss et al. \(2018\), Orr and Jarvis \(2018\), Pre-  
uss \(2007\), Quinn \(2010\), Ritchie \(2000\), Rogerson \(2016\), Sadd \(2010\), Sadd and Jackson  
\(2006\), and Zimbalist \(2015\).  
353 354  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
What has happened over time, unfortunately, is that proponents of mega-events co-opted the  
term legacy to sell the idea of bidding and hosting for long-term benefits while ignoring or  
downplaying most costs and negative impacts, and others have used leveraging to show how it  
can be done. It is only within sound, integrated planning, that both legacy and leveraging are  
workable, and definitely not for mega-events. Why? the following discussion makes it clear.  
Zimbalist \(2015\) highlighted the fallacy of claims made about the economic benefits of mega-  
events, and McGillivray and Turner \(2017\) have documented the illogical claims behind mega-  
event bidding. Brittain, Bocarro, and Byers \(2018\) concluded\: “Overall, the evidence presented in  
this book suggests that, at present, legacy is largely a ‘fairy tale’, if legacy is an intentional outcome of hosting  
a mega event”. They argued that the legacy and related research suit the agendas of powerful  
groups, and that the concept has taken on ‘mystical’ properties. In this context, Talbot \(2021\)  
examined the legacy of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games by taking the perspective of pro-  
testors and objectors, revealing how negative the entire process was in the eyes of many Rio  
residents.  
Sometimes the true value of an element of the legacy will not be clear for a very long time, or  
a consensus on the value might never be achieved. What usually happens is that mega-events  
are justified in advance in economic and business terms, but a full cost-benefit accounting is  
never forthcoming, for purely political reasons. Many costs are typically hidden, or treated  
as externalities, the big items being transportation improvements and security. The so-called  
induced tourism, supposedly generating a quantum leap in tourist demand \(Getz, 1999\), seldom  
materialises, and if tourism does flourish in the aftermath, it is impossible to prove that it hap-  
pened because of the event. Following the Sydney Olympics of 2000, all forecasts of induced  
tourism growth for Australia were demolished by 9/11, resulting in a sharp decrease that lasted  
for years.  
The concepts of net present value and future earnings can be useful in evaluating the legacy. As  
pointed out by many economists, the development of new infrastructure for events is a cost of  
hosting the event, not a benefit. Any derived, future benefits first have to be justified in terms  
of future earnings, and then discounted because of depreciation, increasing maintenance costs,  
and normal investment opportunity costs. Furthermore, many so-called legacies of mega-  
events have turned into expensive, useless facilities.  
# Comprehensive Benefit and Cost Evaluation  
If we want to place a value on an event or events, or determine their worth, we need to evaluate  
all costs and benefits. This process will usually begin with a clear statement of goals, or what  
we want to achieve and avoid.  
*Desired Benefits*  
Clear statements of desired and expected benefits are needed, including explicit reference to  
who will benefit and who will pay \(or experience the negative impacts\). The tangible bene-  
fits in social, cultural, and environmental terms have been discussed, and in economic terms,  
the following are typically the most important goals\: generating expenditure by sponsors and  
other investors, and new infusions \(grants and capital investments\) from a senior level of  
government; new facilities and venues \(if funded externally\); new employment; event tour-  
ist expenditures and their direct economic contribution; positive media coverage resulting  
in tourism gains; general economic growth and trade; and increased capacity \(marketing and Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment accommodation\) resulting in future tourism growth. Intangible economic benefits include  
placing a monetary value on the use and non-use values expressed by residents, community  
pride, cultural renewal, arts development, increased interest and investment in the host com-  
munity or destination, or enhanced real estate values. Increasingly, eventful cities value image  
or branding benefits as much as direct economic gains and are emphasising the non-economic  
benefits as much as quantifiable, monetary gains. This is a paradigm shift in the making, aided  
by concerns about over-tourism, climate change, and threats to peace and quality of life.  
355  
*Potential Direct and Opportunity Costs*  
Tangible economic costs include capital and construction costs, wages, essential services  
\(police, infrastructure\), and the long-term maintenance of venues. The harm done to individ-  
uals, families, and communities is seldom assigned an economic value, but it should be. Other  
intangible costs include\: crowding and inconvenience; noise and visual pollution; personal  
crime and property damage; and resident exodus and tourist avoidance of the area.  
*Externalities and Opportunity Costs*  
Costs or problems not taken into account of events are termed externalities, and they include  
indirect and intangible problems like pollution and amenity loss, and social and cultural dis-  
ruption. Opportunity costs are all the alternative uses that could be made of capital, human  
effort, and other resources. If events constitute good investments, it has to be asked if the same  
resources would generate more benefits when applied to other projects.  
*Evaluating and Weighing Benefits Versus Costs*  
Getz \(2019a\) presented a BACE model \(Benefits and Costs Evaluation\). The concept is that  
evaluation is a step beyond impact assessment and requires much more than measuring goal  
attainment. All the tangible and intangible costs and benefits have to be considered, and this  
must be a multi-stakeholder process. Forecasting and measuring costs and benefits is but a  
step towards reconciling them within sustainability and social equity frames. The model does  
not permit one subject of impact assessment or policy domain to dominate, and all possible  
objects of IA – from individuals to the nation – have to be considered. The distribution of  
costs and benefits might very well be the most important issue, especially because it often  
seems that industry and the community’s powerful elite realise huge profits at the taxpayer’s  
expense, even while poor people are displaced, or the middle class has its taxes increased to pay  
for the mega-event or a new event venue.  
Linked to the BACE model, Getz \(2019a, 213\) provided a guide to identifying winners and los-  
ers. Sometimes only the stakeholders themselves can reach an appropriate conclusion on this  
issue, and that assumes they are all consulted. Some of the criteria for identifying winners  
are\: those who benefit from new facilities and related leisure opportunities \(but can everyone  
afford them?\); elite sport and cultural groups who participate; clean-up of polluted areas and  
restoration of new natural areas could benefit everyone; improved infrastructure, especially  
transport, should benefit most people; construction and suppliers get jobs and profits; new  
housing and property developers. Who are the losers? All those who are displaced from afford-  
able housing; taxpayers left with long-term debt and useless facilities; segments without access  
to the new facilities; businesses not able to pay higher rents, or have been spatially displaced  
from so-called urban renewal precincts. 356  
Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment  
*Impact Assessment, Evaluation, and Sustainability*  
Principles of sustainability should be applied to impact assessments and evaluating the worth  
of events. You need to ask these questions\:  
l Will the event \(or, in the past tense, did the event or events\) make it more costly or difficult

STUDY GUIDE  
A starting point for studying outcomes, or for any aspect of evaluation and impact assessment,  
is to ask the question\: who or what is impacted, and in what way? We have indicated five  
main objects, being social, cultural, ecological, economic, and built environment, and there are  
many possible subjects being the people, organisations, or things affected. People should be  
the first object of our attention, and this broad category can be disaggregated in many ways,  
such as by studying participants, guests, volunteers, residents in general, or a particular social  
or cultural group. Outcomes should be considered in the context of the open-system model  
of event organisations. Similar to an industrial process, organisations and events aim to turn  
inputs into outputs, and in our framework for evaluation and impact assessment, these are the  
short-term and obvious things event producers need to measure such as attendance, revenue  
generated, customer satisfaction, or media coverage. When we think of longer-term outcomes  
or impacts the TOC comes into play because we are now viewing the event \(or events\) as an  
agent of change. Some outcomes are unintended, and even external to the event and the organ-  
isation. External stakeholders are likely to focus on these impacts. Those who are impacted by  
events are legitimate stakeholders, including those who represent environmental, social, and  
cultural concerns. When conducting impact assessments, or evaluations of outcomes, stressors  
or causal factors should first be identified. It is not just the event itself that can cause changes,  
so we have to consider related investments, tourism, physical developments, and media effects.  
The degree to which the community is involved in the event, or in policy formulation related  
to events, will also have an important bearing on outcomes and on how people feel they have  
been impacted. Stressors then have to be linked to the full range of potential outcomes, both  
desired and unintended, internal and external. Whether impacts are positive or negative will  
depend on one’s perspective and on the research and evaluation methods used. This analysis  
leads to policy, strategy, and other possible responses. A range of models and methods are indi-  
cated in this chapter for evaluation and impact assessment, but actually conducting an impact  
assessment requires substantial knowledge and experience with research and consultations.  
The next time you read about event impacts, and particularly when mega-events are discussed,  
you should be in a much better position to evaluate the statements being made about benefits  
and costs. Form your own conclusions. Event Outcome Evaluation and Impact Assessment 357  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Define outputs and outcomes within the context of an open-systems model.

# Introduction  
Substantial reviews of the event tourism field can be found in Getz \(2008\), Getz and Page  
\(2015\), and in a four-volume set by Connell and Page \(2010\). This chapter provides an  
­ overview of the main topics and issues associated with event tourism as a policy area, its  
development, and marketing, professional practice – including possible career paths – and the  
critical ­ question of economic impact assessment.

While tourism is often claimed to be an industry, it is in reality an assemblage of travel and  
hospitality-related components, including events that become attractions. Academics study  
tourism as a social, cultural, and economic phenomenon, and consider all its potential impacts.  
Like event and leisure studies, there is a strong focus on the experience and meanings attached  
to it, with special consideration given to the combination of event and travel experiences.  
Events often play a role in tourism development and marketing, but many events exist with no  
tourism-related purpose or function, and others do attract tourists without trying or even pay-  
ing attention to the fact. What we mean by event tourism, therefore, is the deliberate, planned  
use of events in tourism development and marketing. In this way, events are instruments of  
policy and strategy, in the same way that sports or the arts in general can serve economic  
\(including urban\) development. We also want to study the social, cultural, and environmental  
roles and impacts of event tourism.  
Leisure and tourism studies clearly overlap if one views tourism as a social phenomenon taking  
place within leisure, and they overlap at the business and management level because numerous  
enterprises exist to deliver recreational/travel experiences. Event Studies sits at the intersec-  
tion \(or nexus\) of tourism, leisure, and recreation since it can occur within all of these domains.  
# Destination Management and Event Tourism  
Event tourism introduces a special case in the management fields and professions. A destina-  
tion is not an organisation, although destination management and marketing organisations  
\(DMOs\) exist to develop and promote tourism in cities, with NTOs performing this role at the  
national level.  
A destination is usually thought of as the end point in a person’s journey, but that clearly does not  
cover all forms of leisure or business travel. Events can be the main attraction, making the loca-  
tion a secondary consideration. Journeys often include many different events and places, rather  
than one end point. This is why it is necessary to look at destinations from both the perspective of  
the traveller and the organisations promoting visits. In this way, the delimitation of a destination  
is often equivalent to a political entity, as in a city, state, or country with their DMOs and NTOs.  
Destinations are in competition with each other, but generally there is a recognition that collab-  
oration at some level serves everyone’s interests. In that way, a destination can also be thought  
of as a collaboration among stakeholders who provide attractions, services, and marketing. As  
such, a destination organisation is an institutional arrangement requiring resources and manage-  
ment. It can also be thought of as a policy domain established to further the goals of cities, regions,  
and countries, but with private-sector companies being major beneficiaries. This public–private  
partnership is justified in terms of creating employment, stimulating economic growth, and  
spin-off benefits such as improved infrastructure and leisure opportunities for residents.  
Destinations are seldom managed to any great extent, and DMOs or NTOs are usually focused  
on marketing, typically within a broader strategy of place marketing. It is not unusual for events to  
be marketed as attractions, and their images used for branding, without any meaningful collab-  
oration with the event organisations. A minority of DMOs actually fund and/or produce events  
of their own \(see Getz, 2013, for examples\). NTOs get involved when mega-events are hosted.  
There will be city and destination tourism plans, and increasingly event strategies that include  
portfolio management concepts. As cities and destinations move beyond a narrow mar-  
keting focus, perhaps in response to overtourism or resident demands, there will be more  
­ management. The business plan released in 2019 for European Cities Marketing suggested 360  
Event Tourism  
how this is evolving, emphasising that long-term strategies had become obsolete owing to the  
complexity and rapid change. Their focus was shifting from marketing aimed at generating  
growth to the goals of creating better cities and higher quality of life through responsible tour-  
ism. In part, this was in response to many criticisms of the dominant growth model.  
# Potential Roles of Events in Tourism Development and Marketing  
The five main roles played by events in tourism are illustrated in Figure 15.1. These can be  
thought of as the core propositions of event tourism. In other words, advocates and practitioners  
believe \(on the basis of considerable evidence\) that events can attract tourists, act as catalysts  
for other development, enhance the image of destinations, and animate venues and places.  
This is not theory, although exactly how these benefits can be realised is subject to theory  
development, some of which we will discuss. The diagram also illustrates how event tourism  
fits into various policy domains\: place marketing, social, cultural, environmental, and economic  
development. Note that events are also important in urban renewal, and this is often linked to  
sports, culture-led development, and tourism.  
*Ontologial Themes*  
Dominating both the academic discourse and praxis have been three themes – outcomes,  
demand, and supply – each embodying key terminology and concepts that set it somewhat  
apart from the others. This is an ontological perspective on event tourism, as it pertains to what  
people know, or think they know about the phenomenon.  
The first theme is that of outcomes, with the emphasis placed on the assessment of the economic  
impacts of events and event tourism. Key topics include\: event tourist expenditure and yield;  
seasonality effects; estimation of gross and net economic impacts; occasionally more com-  
prehensive studies of costs and benefits; return on investment; and an interest in leveraging  
events and planning for long-term legacies such as urban renewal or re-positioning in a place-branding  
context. The general acceptance of a sustainability paradigm by academics has led to  
a more triple-bottom-line approach encompassing environmental and socio-cultural impacts,  
so resident perceptions and attitudes are now a very important topic, and this has expanded  
into a multi-stakeholder approach to evaluating outcomes. Moreover, the dominant positivistic

Figure 15.1 The Roles of Events in Tourism and Destination Management & Marketing Event Tourism 361  
emphasis on measuring impacts in monetary terms is giving way to a more ­ interpretive and  
critical evaluation of the roles, costs, and benefits of events, including the matter of exactly  
who gains or loses. As this approach matures, we can expect to see more research and practical  
applications of portfolio management \(i.e., cumulative and long-term value from events as  
assets\) and on the dynamics of populations of events, within which competition for resources  
and markets is a dominant consideration.  
Displacement effects are important in this theme, as an event has the potential to displace other  
tourists \(especially if held in peak seasons\), and in time displacement, which occurs when people  
alter their planned or necessary travel in order to take in an event. The term casual event tourist  
refers to those non-residents who attend an event but do not travel because of its attraction.  
Often hidden in event accounts are externalities like security costs and inflation, crime and  
pollution, disruption of residents’ lives, and destruction of affordable housing, giving rise to  
debates over measurement and disclosure. Opportunity costs are a related concern, as events and  
tourism are not necessarily the only or best way to achieve policy aims. As events have become  
standard tools in development, more and more attention and debate can be expected regarding  
long-term and cumulative impacts.  
Theme two is the analysis and development of demand. Event tourism markets can generally be  
separated into business events, sports, entertainment, festivals, and other cultural celebra-  
tions. Within each of these markets, the emphasis is placed on dedicated event tourists, which are  
those individuals who travel solely or principally because of an event. Key research topics have  
included studies of motivation and the benefits sought, the image of events and their venues,  
the image of host destinations, tourist satisfaction, and the overall event tourist experience and  
effects on future behaviour – including event or destination loyalty.  
Theme 3, supply. There are many actors involved within the public, private, and not-for-profit  
sectors. Not all events are produced with tourism in mind, but they might nevertheless attract  
tourists or entertain casual visitors to a city. Organisers, on the one hand, might want tourists  
as one segment while emphasising residents. On the other hand, there are event development  
corporations that have the explicit mandate of bidding on events, sometimes creating them,  
and marketing destinations through the appeal and imagery of events.  
Business events and sports are usually capital intensive, generally requiring major facilities.  
They are often developed by separate organisations such as convention bureaus and sport  
\(tourism\) commissions. Cultural celebrations, and especially festivals, are favoured by com-  
munities all around the world, in part because they are not necessarily capital intensive, can  
be created anywhere, and tap into both community and tourist desires for authentic social and  
cultural experiences.  
Theory development in event tourism borrows heavily from economics and consumer  
behaviour. Much of the knowledge base is, however, purely factual \(i.e., what you need to  
know in order to develop event tourism\) and of the problem-solving kind \(i.e., how to attract  
tourists\). In looking for event-specific theory, we need to refine the concept of attractiveness as it  
applies to various events \(that is, their drawing power for specific segments\) and in the context  
of combating seasonality of demand and the over-concentration of tourism.  
# Events as Attractions; Attractiveness  
Although many tourism organisations stress international tourism, there is no doubt that most  
festivals and events are dependent on local and regional audiences. But whether events are  
true tourist attractions \(i.e., motivating overnight or non-local travel\), or a reason for visitors 362  
Event Tourism  
already in an area to stay longer, they can have tourism value. Events can also have the effect of  
keeping people and their money at home, rather than travelling outside the region.  
Event drawing power or attractiveness can be measured by how many tourists will be attracted,  
and how far or frequently they will travel. Important goals are to use events to overcome the  
seasonality problem, and to spread demand geographically throughout a country or region.  
The goal should not be to maximise tourist volumes but to develop a manageable and balanced  
portfolio of events that meet multiple goals and generate many benefits. An emphasis on event  
tourist quality, that is, attracting high-yield, dedicated event tourists, is preferred.  
*Comparative and Competitive Advantage*  
Destinations are endowed with certain features that make them attractive, and to the extent  
that they are unique, or in a good location relative to demand, they yield comparative advantages.  
The most obvious destination features are those related to climate \(e.g., winter sun destina-  
tions and winters suitable for ski resorts\), other natural resources \(e.g., water, forests, and  
mountains\), and interesting, vibrant culture and history including festivals and events. Some  
events inherit features and a reputation that gives them advantages over newer, less well-  
known events, and this is one defining characteristic of a hallmark event.  
Even if there are no obvious attractive features or comparative advantages in a destination,  
planning, and creativity can still yield competitive advantages. Developing an attractive event  
portfolio and related infrastructure is one such strategy. Other common initiatives designed to  
create competitive advantages include improvements to accessibility, modernised infrastruc-  
ture, unique urban design features, special interest retailing, and focused marketing.  
*Events and the Seasonality Problem*  
Seasonality refers to the way in which destinations experience, and often suffer from a rise and  
fall in demand over the year. Extreme seasonality is a particularly acute problem, with most or all  
tourists arriving in one season – typically the summer or winter – which results in underutilisation  
of resources and cash flow and staffing problems for businesses. The literature on events and sea-  
sonality is large, starting with a landmark study by Ritchie and Beliveau \(1974\), which determined  
that the Quebec Winter Carnival generated substantial economic benefits for the city and region,  
and over time became a hallmark event for Quebec, effectively co-branded with the city and the  
province. Connell et al. \(2015\) examined responses to seasonality through event tourism, and  
Sainaghi et al. \(2019\) considered the impacts of Milan’s Expo 2015 on the seasonality of demand.  
*Events as Animators*  
Resorts, museums, historic districts, heritage sites, archaeological sites, markets and shopping  
centres, sports stadia, convention centres, and theme parks all develop programmes of special  
events. Built attractions and facilities have everywhere realised the advantages of animation,  
being the process of programming interpretive features and/or special events which make the  
place come alive with sensory stimulation and an appealing atmosphere.  
The potential benefits of animation through events are of major importance to facility and  
attraction managers\:  
l To attract people who might otherwise not make a visit because they perceive the facility or  
attraction itself to be uninteresting. Event Tourism 363  
l To encourage repeat visits by people who might otherwise think that one visit is enough.  
l To attract publicity for the site or facility, including the highlighting of historical events  
associated with the site.  
l To encourage longer stays and greater spending.  
l To target groups for special functions.  
Venues are almost automatically in the events business, out of necessity. Pearce \(1998\) exam-  
ined how attractions in different countries were adding events and integrating with festivals  
and events in their marketing. Whitfield \(2009\) documented the rise of meetings and conven-  
tions seeking unusual venues, and how various attractions were adapting their facilities and  
marketing to cater to this planned event market.  
*Events and Place Marketing; Co-branding*  
Kotler et al. \(1993\) in Marketing Places identified the value of events in enhancing the image of  
communities and attracting tourists. They demonstrated how places compete for investments,  
quality people, and tourists, all in pursuit of more liveable and prosperous communities. Place  
marketing provides a framework within which events and event tourism find multiple roles, as  
image makers, quality-of-life enhancers, and tourist attractions. More traditional approaches  
to economic development stressed industrialisation and the provision of physical rather than  
cultural infrastructure and downplayed the economic value of tourism.  
Co-branding between events and destinations is important \(Chalip and Costa, 2006\). Jago et al.  
\(2002, 2003\) argued that there was substantial potential for events to be used in destination  
branding but that neither event nor destination managers do a good job of harnessing that  
potential. The intent is to reinforce the destination’s brand with compatible events, being a  
transfer of positive images, with a classic case being surfing competitions in Surfers Paradise.  
This is because most destinations contain an array of events, largely beyond the control of the  
state, and for that reason it might be wise to focus on one or a few well-imaged hallmark events  
to achieve place marketing and branding goals.  
Gibson and Davidson \(2004\) examined the application of place marketing through events, and  
related political debates, in the context of how Tamworth became Australia’s self-proclaimed  
country music capital. Andersson and Niedomysl \(2010\) focused on how, why, and what  
Swedish cities hope to achieve by engaging themselves in hosting the try-outs to the Euro-  
vision Song Contest \(ESC\). The study relied on stakeholder interviews and found that local  
authorities did more collaboration than competition for the events. Various motives for bidding  
applied, including demonstrating that the town or city was interested in hosting events. The  
try-out itself was viewed by locals as little more than a good party.  
*Events as Image Makers*  
It is apparent that major events can have the effect of shaping an image of the host community  
or country, leading to its favourable perception as a potential travel destination. With global  
media attention focused on the host city, even for a relatively short duration, the publicity value  
is enormous, and some destinations will use this fact alone to justify great expenditures on  
attracting events. For example, Wang and Gitelson \(1988, 5\) observed that the annual Spoleto  
Festival in Charleston, South Carolina does not appear to be economically justifiable, “but the  
city holds it every year to maintain a desirable image”. 364  
Event Tourism  
Hede and Jago \(2005\) placed the discussion in the context of theory about planned and  
­ reasoned action \(Ajzen, 1985, 1991; Ajzen and Fishbein, 1973; Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein and  
Azjen, 1975\) in which positive perceptions created by the publicity surrounding events \(or  
viewing the events, or reading about them\) leads to positive attitudes, intentions to travel  
there, and eventual travel. This theory, or belief, underlies a great deal of destination promo-  
tion. Hudson et al. \(2004\), however, in conceptualising \(with a graphic model\) the process  
by which events might influence travel choices, concluded that there were many intervening  
factors separating perception from travel behaviour, and that watching events – especially sport  
events – might lead to travel, but elsewhere than the actual host destination, to participate in  
the sport. Indeed, many sport event broadcasts do not provide much in the way of destination  
imagery or information. Longitudinal studies of the impact of hosting the 1988 Winter Olym-  
pic Games in Calgary \(Ritchie and Smith, 1991\) showed how a definite positive image boost  
grew, peaked, and started to decline afterwards. This life cycle of image enhancement related  
to one-time events has also been noted by Mackellar and Nisbet \(2014\). But additional gains  
in tourism infrastructure and the legacy of enhanced tourism marketing and organisation can  
potentially sustain the effect. Hosting major events in succession is another strategy employed  
to sustain the image enhancement effect, and this likely generates a portfolio of permanent  
events to manage.  
Pertinent research has been mostly on how events might change destination image \(e.g.,  
Chalip et al., 2003; Ferreira and Donaldson, 2013; Hede, 2005; Kim et al., 2012, 2014; Li and  
Vogelsong, 2005; Ritchie et al., 2006; Shibli and the Sport Industry Research Centre, 2002;  
Smith, 2005\). Results have been mixed. The somewhat limited research on media impacts  
suggests that enhanced image is difficult to obtain, let alone prove \(Mossberg, 2000\). A study  
by Boo and Busser \(2006\) concluded that the festival under study did not contribute to a  
positive destination image among participants. Indeed, it appeared to have a negative impact  
owing to poor marketing and quality. The researchers pointed out the necessity for further  
research on the imputed connections between events and image enhancement. Hede \(2005\),  
however, concluded that Australians who viewed telecasts of the Athens 2004 Olympics did  
change their overall attitude towards Greece as a destination. Ritchie et al. \(2006\) concluded  
that media broadcasts of events helped change images of Canberra, and they recommended  
that events be part of any promotional strategy for national capitals. Chalip et al. \(2003\)  
examined the effects of different media \(destination and event advertising, and event tele-  
casts\) on nine dimensions of destination image and intention to travel to the host desti-  
nation \(Gold Coast, Australia\) from New Zealand and the USA. They found that different  
media had different impacts in foreign countries, not all of which were positive, and that  
different media could do more or less to attract tourists. For example, some media exposure  
convinced respondents that the event might have negative impacts on the Australian natural  
environment.  
Proactive media management is generally necessary to secure desired media coverage and  
­ communication of the desired image for events and destinations \(Getz and Fairley, 2004\). For  
example, Andrew Smith \(2008, 2009\) examined the use of major events to promote periph-  
eral urban areas and concluded that it is very difficult to intervene with the media to secure  
desired outcomes for places. Jutbring \(2014\) analysed exactly how brand values of the desti-  
nation can be encoded in media coverage of events. Chen \(2012\) examined how the hosting  
of major international events provided the government with opportunities to boost its image  
among the Chinese population. Xue, Chen, and Yu \(2012\) indicated that hosting events can  
be both a positive enhancement to a country’s image as well as a useful public relations tool. Event Tourism 365  
What happens when negative publicity strikes a destination? To a degree, bad news events can  
be managed – by minimising the negative impact and fighting back. Ahmed \(1991\) argued that  
negative images can be turned into positive ones by organising festivals and commemorations  
of the event, although this is restricted mostly to natural disasters and entails the risk of stir-  
ring up unhappy or controversial memories.  
Although it can be concluded from the evidence that events can potentially have an image  
change effect, the measurement of media effects remains a difficult problem for evaluators.  
Advertising-equivalence measures are predominant, with the major shortcoming of only consid-  
ering quantity and content, not impact. Alternatives include more reliance on expert opinion  
from target market areas and a fuller analysis of social media.  
*Events as Catalysts; Leveraging and the Legacy*  
By noting that events can be catalysts for other development or attainment of a variety of  
other goals, we introduce both legacy and leveraging, as discussed in Chapter 14. The term  
catalyst literally means to bring about or assist something else to occur, without itself being  
consumed. The combined and long-term role of event portfolios in stimulating desired changes  
has not been examined in any detail, as almost all the attention has been given to mega-events.  
A carefully managed event portfolio should be able to act as a catalyst for multiple benefits.  
# Development of Event Tourism  
Development is defined here as consisting of planning, funding, building infrastructure, man-  
aging, and marketing event tourism. Another way to look at development is to consider how  
events and event-producing or management companies go about designing, programming, and  
marketing their events as tourist attractions. Full coverage is provided in the book Event Tour-  
ism, \(Getz, 2013\) including examples from various cities. Getz \(2013\) discussed five major  
challenges specific to event tourism planning and development, and these all remain relevant\:  
l Moving from a supply side to a demand-side approach\: instead of relying on selling what you  
have \(i.e., a product orientation based on comparative advantages\) develop products and  
experiences to meet known, and ever-changing, consumer preferences; in particular, move  
from mass tourism to higher yield, special interest, event tourism.  
l From top-down to bottom-up planning\: one master plan is unlikely to be fully relevant or  
implemented, so encourage community-based development; this will encourage sustainable  
strategies and grassroots entrepreneurship.  
l From single-events to portfolio strategies\: companies and destinations can both benefit  
from creating and managing portfolios of events, especially to create overall competitive  
advantages and to maximise resilience.  
l Create your own destination events\: many cities already do this, and some countries; private  
companies like TransRockies create destination events; these attract special interest groups  
and dedicated event tourists.  
l An integrated, sustainable approach\: being responsible, inclusive, transparent, and  
adaptable.  
See Getz \(2013\) for examples of cities, and Antchak et al. \(2019\) for examples of cities, desti-  
nations, and countries engaged in event portfolio planning and development. 366  
Event Tourism  
*Managed Portfolios for Event Tourism*  
According to Getz \(2013a, 23\), “A full portfolio will consist of various types of events, for different target  
markets, held in different places, and at different times of the year, in pursuit of multiple goals”. Portfolio  
management enables longer-term strategies to prevail, thereby fostering sustainability of the  
events sector, and it facilitates synergies such as enhanced economic benefits and the fostering  
of social and cultural capital. “In a portfolio approach the types of events, and their host or owners, will  
often be of less importance than the cumulative effects” \(Getz, 2013a, 23\).  
The original model of an event tourism portfolio \(Getz, 1997; reproduced in Antchak et al.,  
2019, 53\) suggested a pyramid with occasional mega-events at the top and local events \(much  
larger in number\) at the base. In between were periodic hallmark events and regional events.  
The major considerations in building such a portfolio were value creation \(measured in a TBL  
manner, emphasising sustainability\), scale, and drawing power. Permanent hallmark events  
offer the greatest potential value for the least cost and risk, in terms of tourism development.  
With consideration of the failures of mega-events and their high costs, a revised model was  
developed \(see Antchak et al., 2019, 54\) with only three levels\: major one-time events, periodic  
hallmark and iconic events, and a base of local and regional events. In designing and managing  
event portfolios, both for tourism and all other policy aims, several themes are critical. We have  
already discussed leveraging and legacy.  
Synergy\: interactions to achieve more than individual events are able to accomplish  
\(i.e., through networking, sharing, and long-term leveraging\)  
Balance\: This will be context-specific and open to political decision-making, as it means  
satisfying many competing interests and taking into account the desired outcomes.  
For example, by balancing sports with celebrations, and promoting MICE development with  
entertainment. Social goals will require accessible events, while economic goals will require  
­ tourist-oriented events. It also means risk reduction, as described below.  
Diversification\: Drawing from financial portfolio theory, one of the basic elements in event  
portfolios should be risk reduction \(and therefore increased resilience\) through ensuring  
that vulnerabilities and potential are considered. This requires environmental scanning and  
scenario-making.  
*Bidding on Events*  
A substantial part of the event tourism business is bidding on events. This process has been  
described as a special purpose marketplace by Getz \(2004a\). A model was developed to demon-  
strate how bidders \(usually DMOs\) and owners \(often corporations, associations, and sport  
governing bodies\) develop relationships and arrive at a winner. Costs and risks have to be  
balanced against potential benefits, as discussed in terms of the legacy and immediate tourism  
or image impacts. Bidding has also been studied by Emery \(2001\), Persson \(2002\), Westerbeek  
et al. \(2002\), Berridge \(2010\), Foley et al. \(2012\), and Lockstone-Binney et al. \(2014\).  
Chappelet \(2005\) identified five types of bids\:  
1 The real bid\: There is a high degree of competition; the requirements at all levels are complex  
and the governing body \(or event-awarding body\) controls the process.  
2 The alibi bid\: This bid is about creating a certain amount of media attention for the given  
bid candidate, the city and/or the country, but there is no real chance of the bid candidate  
winning. Event Tourism 367  
3 The warm-up bid\: This is about getting a smaller event with the hope of landing a larger event  
in the future. Warm-up bids are meant to show the bid candidate’s event organising capa-  
bilities and raise their hosting profile.  
4 The tacit bid\: When a given event does not attract many candidates, but the event owner still  
requires bids to be officially filed, one edition of the event is given to each candidate.  
5 The replacement bid\: If an event is pulled from one location, the event owner will undertake a  
shortened bid process to find a replacement.  
A high level of competition for events is only good for the owners, as bidding has given rise  
to a considerable amount of corruption, an emphasis placed on adding value by the bidder  
\(that is, going beyond the basic requirements set by owners\), and therefore contributing to  
higher costs. When it comes to mega-events, experience has shown that many cities reject the  
very idea of bidding, or face strong citizen opposition when expensive bids are suggested by  
proponents. Within event portfolios, the one-time event is problematic. What exactly will it  
contribute to overall portfolio strengths and resilience?  
*Eventful Cities and Event Capitals*  
Richards and Palmer \(2010\) argued for the creation of eventful cities as an antidote to stagna-  
tion. Cultural assets and resources are to be used  
...In an attempt to become distinctive, to regenerate the urban fabric and to create  
economic, social and cultural prosperity. The creation and promotion of events such  
as festivals, shows, exhibitions, fairs and championships, have become a critical  
component of urban development strategy across the globe.  
\(p. 2\)  
The eventful city is not merely full of events, but is a city that fosters and manages events for  
multiple purposes – there is direction and strategy, and of course, there must be evaluation and  
accountability. In a special issue themed on festival cities and tourism, Richards and Londono  
\(2022\) said\: “The “festival city” has therefore emerged as a specific type of location\: a place that lends its  
name to its festivals, which in turn add life to their host cities”. A book by Gold and Gold \(2020\) pro-  
vides examples, such as Venice, Edinburgh, and Salzburg.  
Cities sometimes call themselves event capitals or sport capitals, suggesting both a brand and  
a commitment to events, or to one type of event. Being a culture capital is related, although that  
is a title that has to be earned, or won through competition. One of the dangers inherent in  
event development is that of dilution and trivialisation, copy-cat event formulas, and diminish-  
ing cultural authenticity. Too much success can lead to overtourism and negative reactions by  
residents. Portfolio managers are therefore encouraged to take a mostly bottom-up approach to  
development, being strategic design through partnerships.

Before 2020, well-established tourist cities and the people and communities situated on  
local well-trodden “beaten tracks” have been grappling with the negative economic,  
social, and ecological fall-out of hosting large swathes of tourists – what pundits and  
scholars alike dub “overtourism”. Then Covid-19 happened. Travelling across borders  
virtually stopped. Commentators described how the amount of people movement pre-pandemic  
would not recover post-pandemic. They are being proven wrong. Pent-up  
demand means we are witnessing a bounce back, slowly but surely, and those responsible  
for managing tourism and flows of visitors to and across destinations must be vigilant to  
the challenges associated with overtourism. Covid provided us with a period of time to  
rethink current approaches to managing tourists and respective behaviours. Whether or  
not we have remains to be seen.  
The term overtourism has been defined as  
…When a proportion of a local community feels that the presence of tourists and  
the tourism industry is having a material effect on the way of life for local residents in  
a community, leading to a range of different forms of protest against policymakers,  
industry or tourists themselves  
by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation \(2019\). These material effects span  
across social change \(e.g. implying feelings of exposure to antisocial behaviours or  
disregard of one’s own customs etc.\); economic change \(e.g. increases in costs such as  
housing or food prices, waiting times, and traffic congestion, etc.\); and environmental  
change \(e.g. ecological degradation, increased air pollution, people traffic, etc.\). More  
practically, protest occurs when attitudes of a significant part of a disaffected com-  
munity shift from having a positive or neutral stance on the presence of tourists to a  
negative or a rejectionist stance. When the strength of this negative opinion is strong  
enough, this often leads to increased media attention through those disaffected ampli-  
fying concerns and negative outcomes through traditional and digital and citizen-gen-  
erated media. As a result, we are increasingly witnessing organised physical and digital  
resistance play out in specific places, alongside ad-hoc and disparate displays of pro-  
test through art and visual methods \(e.g. banners telling tourists to go home or more  
strident messages via graffiti “your holiday, our nightmare” etc.\). The frequency and  
stridency of protest are becoming increasingly prominent signalling a global resistance  
movement that those responsible for managing tourists must pay attention to \(see  
Plate 15.1\). Event Tourism 369

Critics often describe and explain the antecedents and contemporary reasons why increas-  
ing visitor footfall is desired by those responsible for economic growth, particularly in the  
tourism and related leisure industries \(e.g. hospitality, sports, etc.\), and how this is often  
at the expense of less desirable living conditions for those who are forced to welcome  
outsiders into local quarters \(e.g. residential areas, small business districts, cultural and  
natural spaces like green parks and urban squares\). The “new urban tourism” movement,  
while recognising the role locals play in enhancing tourist experiences through authentic  
and spontaneous host-visitor interactions, is partly to blame as this requires the blending  
of private and public life and the physical movement into local urban spaces visitors may  
not typically frequent. As tourist bubbles within cities become drag-and-drop monochro-  
matic blandscapes, gentrified within an inch of its life, complete with a Starbucks at every  
end and turn, the importance of representing a more local version of the city becomes a  
noble if not moral quest. Yet this requires the acceptance of those locally to welcome the  
global – and that’s not always straightforward.  
Japan provides an extreme case illustrating this overtourism problem. Seeking to grow  
Japan’s reputation as a global tourist destination and contribute to national gdP, the  
government sought to host a mega event \(Tokyo 2020 Games\), reconfigure its tourism  
industry in innumerable ways, and invest heavily in domestic and international destination  
marketing campaigns. This was an unparalleled success. After the Fukushima nuclear  
disaster in 2011, Japan welcomed 7m international tourists, growing to 38 m by 2019 in  
the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Games. However, the country did not have a long history  
of managing and serving the quantity of inbound international tourists. English language 370  
Event Tourism  
proficiency in the hospitality industry for instance was low, requiring an industry-wide  
programme to be developed, through to the need to stimulate local entrepreneurialism  
to drive the creation of new tourist experiences to satisfy new demand. Ramen taxis to  
local walking tours to experience the “authentic” cultural side of Japan were created, as  
well as upgrades to the country’s core transport infrastructure were made\: metro stations  
to the Shinkansen \(bullet train\) and the popularisation of the so-called “Golden Route”  
connecting up key tourist cities and districts. But quickly, Japan’s “all out growth” and  
“volume over value” strategy turned sour with residents reporting and resisting a dete-  
rioration of living standards. Skirmishes between locals and tourists who travel every day  
by bus were common, as locals were denied entry by tourists who carry heavy luggage.  
People in Gion Kyoto geisha district were harassed for taking selfies. Tourists littering  
on streets, jumping on ancient statues, flagrantly ignoring cultural norms like eating and  
walking in public, and speaking too loud on public transport were common sights. The  
local residents appear to be frustrated by the presence of tourists and developed an  
increasing aversion to them \(“tourismophobia”\). Reducing the friction between locals  
and tourists is a key social problem recognised by the Japanese government and Japan’s  
National Tourism Organisation to foster a more sustainable tourism development strat-  
egy in the coming years.  
What does all this have to do with hosting a mega event? Japan utilised the last decade  
to commodify itself and commercialise its cultural product under Shinzo Abe’s \(Prime  
Minister at the point of winning the right to host the Tokyo 2020 Games\) “Abenom-  
ics” that resembles the formative neoliberal years of Reaganomics and Thatcherism. Be  
under no illusion, the Tokyo 2020 Games provided an ideal vehicle to enable Japan to  
rally \(if not force\) its people behind tourism development as a key economic driver. For  
decades and centuries, Japan had resisted the luring commodifying of neoliberalism rel-  
ative to that of other capitalist countries and cities, but the Tokyo 2020 Games served  
as a platform to bring together these ideas and proponents of these ideals to catalyse  
these ­ processes - hailed as a victory for those who have the capital to participate and  
benefit from the windfall, and critiqued by those who do not. The problem is that for  
future countries and cities looking to host mega-events \(e.g. the Olympic and Paralym-  
pic Games, FIFA World Cup, and Commonwealth Games\) the threat or exacerbation of  
overtourism as a potential outcome of hosting is becoming one of the key reasons why  
host populations are lowering support, resisting and/or vetoing event agendas and bids if  
put out to referenda \(see Schnitzer et al., 2021\). This is an existential threat to events, big  
and small, as local people increasingly question “what are the benefits for us?”; “is the  
economic speculation worth it?”; “will we generate a return on investment for the local  
disruption and displacement of existing socio-economic activity likely faced?”. Indeed, as  
we enter a period of event strategy, policy, and practice characterised by an increased  
focus on rights and responsibilities and whether or not events are an appropriate driver  
of sustainable development, holding event owners and organisers to account for return  
on investment for local people has never been so prominent.

*Other Developmental Strategies and Tools*  
Venues\: Destinations compete on the basis of having the best, biggest, or most unique event  
venues. This holds true for convention and exhibition centres, sport stadia and arenas, art  
centres, museums, and historic sites. Investment and operational costs are high, but there is  
no doubt that events at the national and international level of drawing power do provide sub-  
stantial, direct economic benefits. When it comes to justifying the investment in venues, future  
earnings potential has to be weighed against both costs and alternatives \(i.e., the opportunity  
costs\). All too often the cost of new venues \(and other infrastructure\) necessary for hosting  
mega-events has been declared a benefit without any demonstration of future pay-offs.  
Services provided to events\: Most DMOs offer a range of services to events coming to their city  
or destination. These go beyond what the venues offer, and can include any of the following\:  
l Transportation \(employing local destination management companies\).  
l Information before, during, and after \(e.g., on attractions, restaurants, etc.\).  
l Policing and emergency services \(arranged and coordinated; permits obtained\).  
l Water, electricity, clean-up, waste removal, and other essential services \(for outdoor venues\).  
l Business services \(often located within major venues\).  
l Local specialists in audio-visual, design, etc.  
l Food and beverage catering \(arranged, using local suppliers\).  
l Entertainment \(derived from local festivals and performers\).  
Packaging\: Sometimes a package is a product. Events can be packaged with accommodation,  
transportation, entertainment, and touring, making the event itself more attractive. This is also  
called bundling and is a service that DMOs can provide. Destination events in remote areas have  
to be packaged, as they are partially or fully internalised, and should be packaged for pre and  
post-stays in the area. Host communities usually want this feature when considering whether  
or not to support events.  
Positioning\: Events and portfolios of events are automatically in a competitive environment in  
which positioning is important. In this context it means using the marketing mix to develop  
a unique selling proposition, or how you want to be viewed and understood relative to com-  
petitors. This is the idea behind hallmark events \(authentic, traditional, and owned by specific  
communities\) and iconic events \(appealing to specific target segments on the basis of quality  
or uniqueness\). Position in a competitive marketplace has to be tested through research, such  
as asking existing and potential customers how they describe the attributes, and how they feel  
about a range of events or destinations. IP-like mapping can be used effectively. 372  
Event Tourism  
Image\: Here we are talking about how an event or destination wants to be viewed, the image  
it wants to form in everyone’s minds – especially potential customers. Through messages and  
media management, the event or DMO attempts to control image making. Events are tools in  
this process for cities and destinations. The flip side of the coin is consumer research to deter-  
mine the image held, and how it has been influenced by visits, media, and events.  
There have been numerous studies conducted on destination and event image, which includes  
co-branding, and the conclusions are mixed. Events held with the specific aim of improving  
a place image, or re-positioning a city or destination, are on their own not likely to succeed.  
A more comprehensive strategy is undoubtedly required, including a portfolio of events, one  
or more permanent, hallmark events, and the enduring buy-in of residents and other stake-  
holders. As concluded by Collins et al. \(2019, 423\), regarding the effort made to use the Volvo  
Ocean Race to re-image a city \(Galway, Ireland\) and its port\: “...Preevent expectations are often  
not met, entrenched images of a place are difficult to modify, and, regardless of the success of a 9-day event,  
considerable work is required to bring about change in established place imagery”.  
Reputation\: The term refers to a social evaluation of an event or destination on particular crite-  
ria. For example, what are social media influencers saying about you? Is it positive or negative?  
What influences reputation is important. For an event, do accidents and disasters permanently  
condemn an event or destination to a bad reputation \(for everyone or particular segments\)?  
Regarding disasters and pandemics, events provide one means to restore a positive reputation  
by communicating messages such as “we are open”, “you are invited and we are welcoming”,  
or “it is safe now”. For companies such as TransRockies, developing and maintaining a positive  
reputation and the image of being unique is vital to staying competitive and profitable.  
*Event Tourism Market Segments*  
Most tourism organisations distinguish between leisure and business markets, with each being  
subdivided according to strategy and available demand data. Mixed motives must also be consid-  
ered, as business travellers often bring family and stay longer in destinations. Table 15.1 provides  
a useful breakdown, however it has to be said that what separates business and leisure travel is  
open to debate. For our purposes, it is a reflection of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.

Business Segments for Event TourismLeisure Segments for Event Tourism  
Associations\: annual conventions;  
Spectator Sports\: professional and amateur;

Typology of event tourists  
Many classification systems focus on the roles of events in tourism and/or place marketing.  
The nuances of how terms are used are of importance, given that labelling an event as major,  
signature, hallmark, mega or something else might have an only situation or context-specific  
meaning.  
Dedicated event tourist\: travel specifically or mainly because of, and to an event; the destina-  
tion might be a secondary consideration; iconic events cater to all special interest segments.  
Casual and accidental event tourists\: events did not motivate their travel, but they attend while  
on a trip; visiting friends and relatives often results in attending events; accidental refers to  
not having knowledge of the event in advance.  
Participant/active\: versus spectator/sightseer; many events do not occur unless there are  
active participants \(e.g., running and cycling\).  
Accompanying\: friends and family members who accompany someone travelling for an event.  
# Involvement and the Event Travel Career Trajectory \(ETCT\)  
This theory-in-development draws from the foundation theories of serious leisure \(and the related  
constructs of active and serious sport tourism\), ego- or leisure involvement, and social worlds  
\(encompassing sub-cultures, and to a certain extent lifestyles\). The notion of a motivational  
trajectory in which motivation changes over time because of travel experiences came from Pearce  
and Caltabiano \(1983\) and was later largely refuted by Pearce and Lee \(2005\), who concluded  
that multiple, generic motives apply to all leisure travel. However, the trajectory appears to apply  
much more to special interests than it does to general travel motivation, so it has been hypothe-  
sised that motivations should change over time as amateur athletes become more involved \(Getz,  
2008; Getz and Andersson, 2010; Getz and McConnell, 2011\). It has been demonstrated that  
the motivations of highly involved event tourists differ significantly from the lesser involved. In  
particular, the highly involved stress personal development motives, rather than those relating to  
the lower-order needs \(from Maslow, 1954\) such as relaxation and socialising.  
General pleasure travel motivation will often be different from special interest travel. Indeed,  
a considerable amount of research and theory-building has occurred within the field of sport  
tourism, with particular relevance to sport event motivation. Gibson \(1998\) described ‘active  
sport tourists’ as those most likely to travel to participate in favourite pursuits, and they often  
do this well into retirement. Gibson also referred to involvement and recreation specialisation  
theories to help explain motivation and travel behaviour.  
The term career implies serious leisure as theorised by Stebbins. What we want to look for are  
people who, for reasons of their involvement or commitment, not only attend many events but  
demonstrate a progression or pattern of event participation and attendance that stems from  
their increasing experience and shifting motivation. Jones and Green \(2006\) explained the  
relevance of serious leisure and social worlds to sport tourism studies. They said that \(p. 43\)\:  
“Serious sport tourism \(that is, travel to participate in serious leisure\) is able to provide individuals with  
a positive social identity”. And \(p. 44\)\: “Travel to participate in a sport or leisure activity puts one in an  
extended contact with other participants . . . outside of everyday experience, and often includes more expe-  
rienced members of the subculture”. In this context, sport events provide spaces for social identity  
formation and reinforcement.  
McGehee et al. \(2003\) found that highly involved recreational runners travelled more on over-  
night trips to participate in events, compared to medium-involved runners. This confirmed the 374  
Event Tourism  
well-established proposition that greater involvement results in higher levels of participation,  
and for runners, this means participation in competitive events. However, they found that run-  
ners did not attend all the races they would have liked to, owing to a number of constraints  
such as family obligations. Interestingly, highly involved runners also participated in more races  
in their own communities. Those authors suggested that highly involved recreational runners  
could become repeat visitors, assuming they had a good overall race and destination experience.  
Shipway and Jones \(2008\) applied the serious leisure framework to runners’ experiences at a  
major marathon. They classified runners as serious sport tourists on the basis of the level of  
ability needed to compete in a marathon, the length of trip and stay necessitated by participa-  
tion and the relatively high cost of training for the event. Discussion of past event experiences  
by runners was very pronounced, with their running careers highlighted. The durable benefits  
of running were identified as “developing and overcoming personal challenges, experiencing a heightened  
sense of achievement and self-esteem, fun and happiness, healthy living, weight loss and physical well-being,  
injury rehabilitation” \(p. 73\).  
A related construct is the ‘sports tourism demand continuum’ developed by Jackson and Weed  
\(2003\), in which athletes can progress from incidental participation through sporadic, occa-  
sional, regular, and committed levels all the way to ‘driven’. However, this model is more rel-  
evant to professional and elite athletes. In a modification, Weed and Bull \(2004\) took into  
account the importance of travel to participants, with those at the driven level taking part in  
more sport tourism.  
Getz and Patterson \(2013\) explored the travel career in the context of social world theory and  
examined its potential applications beyond sports, while Patterson, Getz, and Gubb \(2016\)  
specifically applied both constructs to yoga practitioners and their travel. Getz et al. \(2014\)  
examined the travel careers of foodies, and Goh et al. \(2019\) applied the ETCT to artists.  
Many of the pertinent studies concern runners and triathletes. Shipway and Jones \(2007, 2008\)  
examined the careers of amateur distance runners, concluding they collected subculture capital  
from participation in events, leading to “the desire to travel and collect places” \(2008, 72\). Lamont  
and Kennelly \(2011\) concluded that various constraints have to be taken into account, as event  
travel careers are not necessarily linear. Lamont, Kennelly, and Wilson \(2012\) claimed that the  
choice of events is contingent upon their availability and the intensity of competing priorities.  
Those highly involved might still participate in local and low-profile events as preparation for  
more challenging events or as a consequence of ‘pulsation’ \(p. 1077\).  
Buning and Gibson \(2015\) proposed an elaboration, reflecting a social world perspective, being  
a six-stage model consisting of initiation, introduction, expansion, peak threshold, mainte-  
nance, and maturity. In support of the ETCT, Buning and Gibson \(2016a\) studied cyclists and  
detected “…an escalation in motivation related to intellectual, social, mastery competence, giving back,  
and competition against others with career progression”. They observed that travel behaviour linked  
to events changed with career progression, but concluded that “…preferred characteristics related  
to destinations and travel style remained relatively stagnant”. Buning and Gibson \(2016b\) concluded  
that the travel preferences of active cyclists “… vary based on travel conditions and that attractive  
destinations only become advantageous if event participants are traveling with non-cyclists or on trips involv-  
ing longer distances”. These findings reflect only one sport, and together indicate the need for  
ongoing research across a range of sports, events, and destinations.  
Researching three types of sport tourists, cyclists, runners and triathletes, Newland and Aicher  
\(2018\) determined that travel behaviour varied with both the type of sport and the individual  
athlete’s motivation. They pointed out the need for careful targeting of the mix of event and  
destination attributes. Event Tourism 375  
*Main Hypotheses for the ETCT*  
According to Lee et al. \(2016, 493\), a number of studies have provided support for the exis-  
tence of event travel careers. They concluded the six dimensions hypothesised by Getz and  
Andersson \(2010\) were widely acknowledged.  
H1 \(Motivation\)\: highly involved event tourists will be motivated significantly more by  
higher-order needs related to self-actualisation. In the context of competitive sport, this  
translates into personal motivations like meeting challenges and self-improvement, as  
opposed to social and relaxation motivation. By implication, motivations should be revealed  
to change over time.  
H2 \(Travel Style\)\: highly involved event tourists will be significantly different from others  
participating in the event. They should travel to more events, possibly more with partners  
and family, and combine events with general holidays.  
H3 \(Temporal\)\: highly involved event tourists will exhibit less seasonality in their travel, as  
they seek out specific events; destinations employ events to counter normal demand peaks  
and troughs.  
H4 \(Spatial\)\: highly involved event tourists will travel farther, longer, and more by air. An  
advancing career in their leisure pursuit should result in higher-level competition at the  
national and international levels.  
H5 \(Event Types\)\: highly involved event tourists will participate in different types of events,  
related to their prestige, novelty, or perceived challenge. Certain events are iconic within  
social worlds; experienced runners, for example, should also be novelty-seekers.  
H6 \(Destination and Event Choice Criteria\)\: the importance of various criteria when select-  
ing events and destinations will differ significantly between higher- and lesser-involved  
event tourists. The ideal holiday destination for the highly involved will provide the oppor-  
tunity to participate in an event and to satisfy partners or family members.  
Figure 15.2 illustrates the ETCT, reflecting the six basic hypotheses and suggested modifica-  
tions arising from the literature reviewed above.

better performance? How do they combine their interest in running, art, or any other pur-  
suit with more general leisure and travel preferences? How can event designers maximise the  
desired experiences of the highly involved as well as those for whom the event is only of general  
interest?  
One study by Andersson, Armbrecht and Lundberg \(2019\) tested the ETCT on five different  
participation sport events that are part of the Swedish Classics and provided additional evi-  
dence that the hypotheses are sound, although it was also revealed that there are differences  
among athletes, types of events and the specific appeal of individual events \(see the Classics  
website\: https\://ensvenskklassiker.se/en/\).  
The key findings were\:  
l International event respondents were more active than Swedish participants; that is, they  
planned to attend more events in the subsequent year.  
l Participants in the five sports were significantly different in a number of important ways;  
there are dynamic and diverse styles of event and destination choices in the world of ama-  
teur sport event tourists.  
l The more active travel to significantly more events and travel longer distances; they are  
also involved with social worlds and travel to a larger extent with teams or clubs; they have  
participated in more events and plan to continue this tendency.  
l The more active respondents were significantly more motivated by self-development; chal-  
lenge is important to all, and can be considered a general identifier of the event sport tourist,  
and this corroborates earlier data from the Gothenburg half marathon \(Getz and Andersson,  
2010\).  
# Economic Impact Assessment for Event Tourism  
There have been well-documented problems with economic impact assessments for events  
\(Crompton, 2006; Crompton and McKay, 1994; Getz, 2013; Matheson, 2002; Matheson and  
Baade, 2003; Tyrell and Ismail, 2005\), pertaining to both how they are done and the purposes  
they serve. Dwyer and Jago \(2014, 130\) identified criticisms associated with the assessment  
of the economic impacts of events, highlighting the exaggeration of benefits owing to either  
deliberate manipulation or faulty methods. The state-of-the-art economic impact assessments  
for events have progressed to the point where we can say there is no excuse for invalid and  
unreliable studies. The first comprehensive economic assessment of a major Australian event,  
by Burns et al. \(1986\), laid most of the foundations, including economic cost-benefit eval-  
uation. Burgan and Mules \(1992\) reported on the economic impacts of sport events, while  
Crompton’s \(1999\) report for the National Parks and Recreation Association provided specific  
guidelines for municipalities to conduct valid event impact studies. Two studies by Dwyer et  
al. \(2000a, 2000b\) laid out the requirements for assessing and forecasting event impacts; they  
were based on a meta-analysis of Australian event impact studies, as well as economic theory.  
The Cooperative Research Centre in Sustainable Tourism in Australia has also published a  
series on event impacts including Economic Evaluation of Special Events\: A Practitioner’s Guide \(Jago  
and Dwyer, 2006\).  
Models and Multipliers\: Numerous IA’s for tourism and events have employed models and mul-  
tipliers, although we argue this practice has done more harm than good by exaggerating pur-  
ported benefits and downplaying or ignoring costs. The multiplier effect is mostly expressed in  
terms of income or value added to the area. Many authors have used multipliers, which are Event Tourism 377  
problematic in both theory and practical application \(see, for example\: Archer, 1982; Burns  
et al., 1986; Crompton, 1999; Crompton and McKay, 1994; Dwyer et al., 2000a, 2000b; Flem-  
ing and Toepper, 1990; Jago and Dwyer, 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Tyrrell and Johnston, 2001;  
Vaughan, 1979; Yu and Turco, 2000\). Dwyer et al. \(2006\) have recommended the use of com-  
putable general equilibrium models for assessing the economic impacts of events beyond the  
local area, rather than input–output models. The input–output approach, they argued, contains  
an upward bias if used for broad regions or nations.  
Direct Economic Contribution \(DEC\)\: There is general agreement that the estimation of direct eco-  
nomic contribution is the starting point for all economic IA’s for events \(Dwyer et al., 2010\), but  
we argue that it is all that is needed and desirable. A DEC calculator is provided at the website  
EventImpacts.com but because nothing is ever as simple as a calculator makes it appear, you  
MUST read the Guidance Notes \(a downloadable PDF\) provided by EventImpacts. Getting the  
right data, avoiding invalid assumptions, and knowing how to interpret forecasts and post-  
event impact assessments are crucial \(Figure 15.3\).  
Several terms require explanation.  
New Money \(or incremental income\) has to be attributable to the event. In other words, if there was  
no event this money \(e.g., tourist spending, grants, sponsorship, revenue from sales\) would  
not enter the local economy. Direct, secondary, and tertiary impacts must be estimated for spe-  
cific areas, usually the locality of the event. This requires detailed surveys of tourist spending  
and documentation from event organisers and possibly local authorities. The critical data from  
tourists are\: reasons for travel; length of stay; party types and size; spending within the area  
being studied. Most of the DEC from event tourists comes from overnight stays, as travel costs  
might very well accrue as income to airlines, tour operators, and others outside the area. Event  
organisers have to provide data on their income sources and expenditures.  
Leakages\: Not all the direct income or new money stays in the local area. The event has possibly  
spent money outside the area for advertising, travel, supplies, etc. Local businesses are often  
externally owned, and their profits are sent away. Many local economies must import goods. An  
estimate has to be made of how much of the new money actually stays and circulates.

Backward Linkages\: To maximise local economic benefits, events should buy from local suppliers  
and employ local workers, so the money stays and circulates locally. Events can spend locally  
by policy, and donate money as well, thereby achieving local economic growth. The same logic  
applies at the regional and national levels where the multiplier is higher because of less leak-  
age. The smaller the economy, the smaller will be the economic contribution.  
Secondary Impacts are due to the circulation of new money within the area. There will be leak-  
ages, and the size of the secondary impact will be substantially smaller than the DEC.  
Induced impacts, at the tertiary level, are attributable to increased consumer spending as money  
circulates and generates economic activity. In small economies, this contribution can be tiny.  
# Education and Careers in Event Tourism  
Once the preserve of marketing professionals, now numerous DMOs and special purpose event  
development agencies are employing event tourism professionals who understand the roles  
events can play in destination development and marketing.  
An educational background in tourism, events, and marketing is a suitable basis for employ-  
ment, but increasingly there will be specialisations within event development agencies and  
DMOs. Table 15.2 lists a number of positions, with sample titles, and key associated tasks.

STUDY GUIDE  
Event Tourism is an optional career path for event management professionals but is distinctive  
in several ways. Destinations can be defined in different ways, so it will be useful to look at  
the hierarchy in your area – from local to national – to find out which agencies are involved.  
Are they public, private, or a mix? Do they have an events strategy? What roles for events are  
made explicit, and do they explicitly manage an event portfolio? If there is a plan, examine it  
to determine if goals for events apply to multiple policy areas, and what methods are used to  
achieve them. As to event tourists, there should be data to examine, such as origins, length of  
stay, spending, motivation, and trip purpose. Has there been original research? What you want  
to look for is evidence of target marketing, the value of dedicated event tourists, and possibly  
of event travel careers. Finally, consider possible careers in event tourism. What will you need  
in the way of education, training, and experience to advance in this sector?

STUDY QUESTIONS  
Define destination from the perspective of event tourists and governments.  
When is an event the actual destination?  
Of the various roles events can play in developing tourism, which do you think will be most  
effective in generating economic benefits? social and cultural benefits? Explain.  
What is the difference between image and reputation? How can they be managed?  
Regarding an event tourism portfolio, what is the potential role of one-time events won  
through bidding?  
Are mega-events more important than hallmark events in destination development and  
marketing? Why?  
In the event travel career trajectory, explain the concept of highly involved and specify its  
implications for marketing events as tourist attractions.  
Consider an international trip you might make to attend an event. Work through the initial  
costs and trip-related spending to determine how much would stay in the local area where  
the event is held. What would be your DEC?  
Define and give examples of leakages and backward linkages in the context of a specific event.  
Provide goals for a strategy to maximise the local economic benefits of events in your area.

Upon completion of this chapter students should know the following\:  
l Contributions of foundation disciplines \(Anthropology; Sociology; Philosophy; Religious  
Studies; Psychology; Social Psychology; Economics; Political Science; Law; History; Human  
Geography; and Future Studies\) to understanding the roles, meanings, importance, and  
impacts of events in society and culture.  
l Contributions of closely related fields to Event Studies, such as Leisure, Sport, Visitor, Hos-

l How to relate the theory and methodological contributions of disciplines and fields to issues  
and management functions discussed previously in the book.  
# Introduction  
Tables are provided for each discipline, profession, and field, providing a short description of  
its focus and major contributions to the nature and meaning of event experiences, antecedents,  
planning and producing events, outcomes and patterns, and processes. A selection has been  
made, which inevitably means that other useful contributions are left out. Readers should  
relate the following discussion to earlier chapters where specific theoretical contributions have  
been incorporated. Selected Readings provide an introduction to the pertinent literature in  
each field and discipline.

# Cultural Anthropology  
This foundation discipline is typically defined as the scientific study of culture and society and  
how they develop, including language and religion, with ethnographic research as its distinc-  
tive methodology. We draw on cultural anthropology for explanations of the origins and rea-  
sons for festivals and celebrations, and for providing the theoretical framework of rituals and  
liminality. Ethnology is defined as the systematic comparison of cultures \(Table 16.1\).  
*The Meaning and Dimensions of Culture*  
Schultz and Lavenda \(2005, 4\) defined culture as “sets of learned behaviour and ideas that human  
beings acquire as members of society”. Culture is learned and passed on. It evolves and takes on  
different dimensions reflected in belief systems, symbols, and ritualistic behaviour. Culture is  
“central to the explanations of why human beings are what they are and why they do what they do” \(Schultz  
and Lavenda, 2005, 4\). Holism is the principle of studying cultures as complex systems, the  
implication being that the study of events has to be placed in a very broad context. For example,  
events may contain highly symbolic representations of importance to a culture or sub-culture.  
Culture and its study are often contested – even becoming highly political or involving conflict.  
Who speaks for disenfranchised groups, and how does history judge the winners and losers  
of war or colonisation? Indeed, some anthropologists have a mission, or at least a particular  
agenda. Mitler et al. \(2004\), in their text on cultural anthropology, insist that this discipline  
should be relevant to contemporary issues.  
*Ethnography*  
Fieldwork, often an ethnographic description and analysis of one cultural group, still domi-  
nates cultural anthropology. Traditional ethnography involves living among people to gain a  
deep understanding of their culture and ways of life. Although the early development of this  
discipline was marked by a distinct bias, separating so-called civilised cultures from primitive,

today’s anthropologist values cultural relativism – the belief that cultures should not be studied,  
let alone devalued, through the lens of their own belief system.  
Holloway et al. \(2010\) reviewed the use of ethnographic methods in Event Studies, arguing for  
a more qualitative approach to experience-related research. Ethnography enables researchers  
to better explore structures and interactions within their cultural context, as well as the mean-  
ings people give to events and their environment. Such research is inductive, often starting  
without a theoretical perspective or proposition, and often includes case studies, participant  
observation, and interviews. Purposive sampling is favoured over random sampling, in order to  
talk to or observe people of specific interest.  
Attention has been given to rites and rituals in explaining the origins, forms, and meanings of  
festivals and carnivals in particular, and to the importance of communitas in potentially all event  
experiences. Anthropological exchange theory was discussed, pertaining to the importance of  
symbolism. Cultural antecedents and meanings are an important topic, as is cultural impact  
assessment. We discussed authenticity and commodification in these contexts.

# Sociology  
Sociology is concerned with interactions between people \(i.e., social life\) including a focus on  
how relationships are patterned in the form of groups, organisations, and whole societies.  
Social rules and process are examined, together with social behaviour, and large-scale social  
processes. Social behaviour is mostly learned, and sociologists study the totality of behaviour  
as influenced by all facets of life including economic and political systems, family and friends,  
institutions, and entertainment. The subject has a wide-ranging impact and influence upon the  
study of events \(Table 16.2\). Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields 383

According to the online source www.sociology.org.uk, major themes in this discipline include the  
following\:  
l ‘Socialization process’\: learning how to become human and to behave in ways that accord with  
the general expectations of others \(in short, to be socialised\).  
l The structure of ‘social life’\: values, norms, roles, and status \(social controls\).  
l ‘Values’ are beliefs that we have about what is important, both to us and to society as a whole.  
l ‘Norms’ are expected, socially acceptable, ways of behaving in any given social situation.  
l ‘Role’ – social roles we expect people to play.  
l ‘Status’ – earned or assigned.  
l ‘Social groups’\: communities of interest; ­ relationships within groups.  
l ‘Culture and identity’\: influencing factors on cultural identity include age, gender, ethnicity,  
and regionalism.  
l ‘Subcultures’\: groups sharing a particular way of life.  
*Research Traditions and Methods*  
Sociologists use the scientific method and have a long tradition of positivistic methodology. How-  
ever, there has also been a tradition of humanistic sociology, which stresses the understanding of  
cultural values, meanings, symbols, and norms. Multicultural comparisons are important. Both  
quantitative and qualitative methods are used, as is ethnography – which is very much akin to  
cultural anthropology. There are several clear perspectives or theoretical approaches that shape  
both research methodology and what is studied by sociologists. Alternative, competing tradi-  
tions of research are now widespread in sociology \(Veal, 2006\). 384  
Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields  
Veal \(2006\) assessed the evolution of sociological research pertaining to leisure and tourism  
and concluded that the early modelling/prediction emphasis, based on large-scale social sur-  
veys and quantitative analysis \(within the ‘functionalist’ tradition\), had not worked well. More  
qualitative methods became fashionable in the 1970s and 1980s, with a shift towards learning  
more about why people did what they did, and what it meant to them, rather than just mea-  
suring and forecasting what they did. This era gave rise to research and theory development on  
leisure benefits and constraints.  
*Social and Cultural Capital*  
The sociologist Bourdieu \(1972, 1986\) distinguished between economic, social, symbolic,  
and cultural capital. Economic capital refers to a command of cash or other assets that can be  
invested for profit, while social capital consists of the possession of resources that derive from  
group membership, relationships, networks of influence, and support. Cultural capital consists  
of knowledge, skills, education, and other advantages possessed by a person that results in  
higher social status. Parents are said to transmit such advantages to their children. Symbolic  
capital accrues to individuals as resources on the basis of honour, prestige, or recognition – that  
is, some people stand out as icons. These concepts are in tune with a long tradition of philo-  
sophical thought and sociological theory on the value of networks, and the need to foster social  
cohesion through institutions and policy. There are clear conceptual links to notions of civil  
society and the power of communitas through celebration. In other words, social networking  
has value, and festivals and events can foster it – they also lead to the establishment of events  
for many social worlds and groups.  
Reciprocity and trust are the foundations of social capital, and to some extent, these qualities  
of social life are found in all communities and societies. Where social capital is high, people  
are more likely to be polite, talk to strangers, interact as equals, and perform random acts of  
kindness. In other words, we invest social capital in our community and expect others to do  
the same \(this is similar to social exchange theory\). Voluntarism can be viewed as a form of social  
capital at the community level, as can community-based decision-making, informal business  
transactions, and spontaneous celebrations. Putnam \(2004\) placed more emphasis on benefits  
accruing to the community, while others \(e.g., Bourdieu, 1986; Coleman, 1988, 1990\) con-  
ceptualised social capital at the individual level. When a person develops a substantial social  
network of friends, allies, and collaborators, their social capital increases, and when invested it  
can result in a variety of economic, social, psychological, and emotional benefits. Some people  
pursue the accumulation of social capital through deliberate networking, while others acquire  
it unconsciously.  
Social capital was discussed in Chapter 14 with regard to social impact assessment.  
*Social Worlds*  
Unruh \(1980, 271\) used the term social world to describe “the notion that actors, events, prac-  
tices, and formal organizations can coalesce into a meaningful and interactional important unit of  
social organization for participants”. Involvement in social worlds is voluntary, even though  
‘guidelines, expectations, and rules certainly exist’ \(1980, 277\). It can be partial, so that order  
within a social world is negotiated and its bounds are those of the ‘universe of discourse’. Total  
involvement in one social world is highly unlikely, given that leisure choices can lead to Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields multiple affiliations. Interactions are mediated because of reliance on various channels of  
communication rather than spatial, kinship, or other formal ties. Nevertheless, some meet-  
ing places are usually important \(these can be events\), and some places are associated with  
social worlds because of their concentration of actors, practices, or events \(a destination  
could become a mecca for runners, for example\). Communication centres are vital, being  
the points where a great deal of the involvement is focused; communication sets limits  
on the extent of the discourse that defines a social world. Withdrawal from social worlds  
might carry a cost in terms of loss of one’s interpersonal contacts. Unruh provided a very  
useful framework for assessing social worlds. The analysis examines participants \(‘actors’\),  
what they do \(‘practices’\), important events in their social world activities, and organisations  
involved in or influencing social worlds. Consider social world theory in the context of  
online communities and special interest tourism, the social experiences that motivate event  
attendance, and serious leisure.  
385  
*Social Exchange Theory*  
Hormans \(1958\) suggested that social action is different from straightforward economic  
actions within a marketplace \(i.e., buying and selling\) because social actors expect and receive  
rewarding reactions. Resource exchanges \(as well as the bestowal of prestige or support\) are,  
in this context, the result of free, personal choice based on the assessment of expected costs  
and benefits. People can feel pressure to give, but exchanges should balance out over time.  
The theory also embodies the concepts of power and dependency within relationships and  
social networks. In the context of Event Studies, this theory has been used to explain variation  
in resident perceptions of, or attitudes towards, events. For example, people benefiting from  
event tourism will tend to be positive in their attitudes towards the event and its continuance,  
while people perceiving no benefit tend to be more critical and less supportive. See the section

# Philosophy  
Philosophers use reasoning, not empirical research, to theorise about the meaning of life and  
belief systems. However, the nature and scope of philosophy are subject to influence by chang-  
ing societal values and scientific discoveries. People who contemplate the meaning of life gen-  
erally fall into two categories\: those who adopt religious or spiritual meanings, and those who  
search elsewhere, inside their own minds and value sets. Philosophy is concerned with the  
nature of religion and spiritualism but does not embrace faith or divine revelation, only reason-  
ing. However, philosophy provides a firm foundation in the analysis of event phenomena, and  
in the meaning of event experiences.  
Professional and personal codes of ethics are philosophically based as are many of the politi-  
cal positions taken on policies affecting events. Our entire discussion of sustainability can be  
reviewed in the light of philosophical discourse and positions, with reference to the meaning  
and practice of stewardship. Aesthetics and the meaning of art have major implications for event  
design. One’s personal philosophy impacts the drive for self-development \(or self-improvement\)  
and well-being. All our discussions of values and valuing events or event experiences have a  
foundation in philosophy, even if people cannot articulate how their beliefs shape experiences  
and meanings \(Table 16.3\). How values affect politics and policies is clearly important, and this  
came into focus during and immediately following the pandemic – just how valued are events?

# Religious Studies  
The study of religion includes attention to its origins and evolution, the comparison and anal-  
ysis of belief systems, and the evaluation of impacts on society. The rites, rituals, and celebra-  
tions of various religions are scrutinised, including the use of anthropological methods, and  
this has direct relevance in Event Studies. Theologians hold religious belief systems and apply  
their specific beliefs and related values to interpreting or criticising all aspects of human soci-  
ety. Since so many events are religious in origin or theme, or contain programmed elements  
that hold religious meaning \(even something as common as an opening prayer or blessing\),  
theology contributes to Event Studies. In some societies, it is more a matter of spirituality,  
or even mysticism, that one finds reflected in modern events. Pilgrimage has been discussed  
in this context, and it also relates to the notion of transformative experiences \(Table 16.4\).

# Psychology  
The study of the human mind, thought, and behaviour constitutes psychology. There are many  
sub-fields and specialised applications, such as you will encounter in education and interpre-  
tation \(the psychology of learning\) and industrial psychology, applied to management. There  
are also divisions in psychology, notably humanistic psychology, represented by the works of  
Maslow, which takes a phenomenological approach that is in direct opposition to the scientific  
or positivistic paradigm that dominates the subject area. Needs and wants were given consid-  
eration earlier in the book, linked to motivation to attend events. Also, review the effects of  
personality and perception in the decision-making process.  
In this section we examine two mainstream branches, cognitive psychology and the psychology  
of personality, then we turn to two blended sub-disciplines of particular relevance to Event  
Studies\: environmental psychology and social psychology. Their significance in the wider  
debates on the contribution of psychology to Event Studies is demonstrated by Benckendorff  
and Pearce \(2012, 165\), who provide the most comprehensive review of the field and address  
the principal questions facing psychologists.  
A major question facing event planners and designers is that of personal development and  
transformation through event experiences. Psychological factors must also be considered when  
evaluating engagement with events, whether as volunteers, staff, participants, or spectators,  
and their training and learning processes \(Table 16.5\).

*Environmental Psychology*  
Environmental psychology has considerable potential for enhancing Event Studies, as it has  
done in tourism research \(Fridgen, 1984\). It is an interdisciplinary field focusing on the per-  
ception and cognition of natural and built environments \(see Moser and Uzzell, 2003 for an  
explanation of its scope and application to leisure\). The environment is viewed as both the  
context for behaviour and a determinant of behaviour \(see, for example, Plate 16.1\). Environ-  
mental psychologists also examine the consequences of human behaviour on the environment.  
We have discussed the interactions of setting, people, and management on the event experi-  
ences and environmental factors affecting perceptions of the special place and mood designers  
attempt to create \(Table 16.6\).  
*Social Psychology*  
Mannell and Kleiber \(1997, 25\) wrote that “Social psychology is the scientific study of the behaviour  
and experience of individuals in social situations”. For the purposes of Event Studies, social psy-  
chology helps us understand the nature and causes of behaviour at events, based on studying  
the relationship between the mind, groups, and behaviours. Social psychology has a range of  
theories and concepts it uses to study these themes. A great deal of Leisure Theory is based  
on social psychology, discussed specifically in this book in the context of generic social motiva-  
tions and benefits \(linked to communitas and well-being\), crowd behaviour and management,  
and values and meanings placed on events \(Table 16.7\). 390

# Economics  
Craven \(1990, 3\) argued that within economics the principal challenge is how we allocate  
resources, given that many resources are scarce. Therefore, economists look at how these  
resources need to be allocated and the ways in which they are distributed. A key term in this  
debate is the term scarcity, meaning that most resources in society are finite, and decisions  
have to be made on the best way to use and sustain them. Economists define resources in  
terms of\:  
l Natural resources \(e.g., the land\).  
l Labour \(e.g., human resources and entrepreneurship\).  
l Capital \(e.g., synthetic aids to assist in producing goods\).  
Collectively these resources constitute the factors of production that are used to produce both  
goods and services. The way in which goods and services are divided amongst people has been  
examined by economists in terms of the distribution of income and the degree of equality and  
efficiency in their distribution.  
An economic perspective on event tourism has dominated, including marketing to combat  
seasonality and events staged for destination development. Economic impact assessment is  
covered in Chapter 15, emphasising the process of estimating a direct economic contribution  
to a given area. Opportunity costs, externalities, and costs and benefits are of great impor-  
tance. Additional topics covered in this book are economic forces and trends \(macroeconom-  
ics\), leveraging and the legacy, the use of events in economic and urban development, event  
finances, and budgeting \(which can be thought of as microeconomics\). Also refer to discus-  
sions of value, with utility value representing many economic considerations such as value for  
money \(Table 16.8\). 392

# Political Science  
Political science is the theory and practice of politics, political systems, and political behaviour.  
Political scientists study government and its processes, public institutions, power and poli-  
cymaking, politics, intergovernmental and international relations. Political philosophy, on the  
other hand, is more concerned with values and political ideas, such as the differences between  
Marxism and capitalism, or the meanings of rights and justice.  
The policy implications of the pandemic have been discussed in this book, including regulations  
and funding. Governance is important both at the micro level \(the event organisation\) and in bring-  
ing all stakeholders together, including governments. Political meanings attached to events can be  
significant, and there is a separate category we identified called political and state events. Protests  
often accompany them. Mega-events in particular attract political controversy \(Table 16.9\). Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields 393

# Law  
Governments at all levels pass a multitude of laws, each of which is enforceable by the police  
or other formal action. Laws either forbid actions or mandate them. They govern how persons  
and organisations interact, and what happens in cases of violations and disputes. There is a vast  
legal system for lawmaking and law enforcement, including layers of courts, the law profession,  
and law enforcers. A central tenet of democratic societies is the rule of law, in which justice  
is based on law and the courts rather than arbitrary decisions. This is all supposed to prevent  
abuses and protect fundamental rights. Laws and regulations have come to the fore not only  
because of the pandemic but also because of periodic disasters at mass assemblies. Human  
Rights has been identified in this book as a topic of concern. We have not paid attention to  
contracts and other legal aspects of event management, which will require specific legal advice  
within each jurisdiction. Legal ramifications of event management must be fully evaluated  
within the risk management process, and we have detailed how that links to disasters, resil-  
ience, health, and safety \(Table 16.10\). 394

Events operate within political and legal systems that at once facilitate, constrain, and hold  
accountable the people and organisations producing them. What events can be held, and what  
activities can be allowed, remain a legal matter. Every event producer understands the need to  
obey laws, satisfy regulatory agencies, involve the police in security matters, and obtain the  
advice of lawyers when it comes to contracts, risk assessment, and many other technical matters.  
Event-producing organisations need to be legally sanctioned or incorporated. Taxes have to be  
paid and audits filed. One source is Becker \(2006\) The Essential Legal Guide to Events. However, the  
legal system and the laws it creates and enforces are different in every country, and laws change.  
Distributive justice is a principle that applies to economic development and impact assessment,  
raising the question of who benefits and who pays. Within welfare geography, it adds the addi-  
tional concept of territorial justice, whereby who benefits and pays has the added dimension  
of who is affected, where, and why. ‘Legal justice’ is another relevant concept, tied closely to  
constitutions and the courts. If something goes wrong, can the aggrieved party find justice?  
The section on Human Rights in Chapter 2 and the expert opinion by Adam Talbot in Chapter 3  
deal with this important legal and moral topic.

# History  
History does look at dates and chronologies, but historical facts are only the starting point.  
According to the American Historical Association \(www.historians.org\), history studies the  
human condition and social change. The ability to assess evidence, and to assess conflicting  
interpretations, is essential to what historians do. Because historians are usually researching  
a topic or theme, and often from a disciplinary perspective, it is common to speak of historical  
geography, historical sociology, etc. All of the disciplines we talk about in this book can be  
studied through the lens of historical fact-finding and interpretation \(Table 16.11\). Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields 395

# Human Geography  
In the study of events, the predominant focus is on human geography with a focus on people  
and their activities - although there is also a role for physical geography, with the growing  
interest in environmental sustainability and the impact of hosting events on the natural envi-  
ronment and in resource use such as our carbon footprint and climate change. Geographical  
analysis can be linked directly to any of the other social sciences, and what is particularly rele-  
vant to the study of events can be described as economic/developmental, cultural/social, his-  
torical, political, or behavioural geography. Geographical analysis can also be applied to almost  
any form of human endeavour or a particular environment so that we can also speak of urban  
and rural geography or event geography. Links to physical geography, or the environmental  
sciences, are always present \(Table 16.12\). 396

# Future Studies  
Human fascination with the future is at least equal to our curiosity about the past. Visioning  
and goal setting are totally future-oriented. When we talk about planning events, we are actu-  
ally seeking to shape the future. General research enables us to say more about probable future  
conditions, while marketing research gives us greater confidence that our plans will succeed. It  
is no wonder, then, that futurism and future studies have become so popular. Future Studies is an  
interdisciplinary approach to gaining an understanding of how today’s conditions and trends will  
likely shape the future \(in part, it is therefore impact forecasting\), and how future conditions  
could be shaped by policies and actions taken \(or not taken\) today – as in how we need to reduce  
greenhouse emissions to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Trend analysis, forecasting,  
environmental and future scanning, and scenario making are tools of future studies \(Table 16.13\). Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields 397

This is a neglected research theme in Event Studies, with few contributions. Much more  
­ scenario-thinking has occurred, however, as a result of the pandemic and the need for building  
greater resilience in the system. Our examination of forces, trends, and issues in this book, plus  
the research agenda, should act to encourage more event-specific future studies.

# Leisure Studies  
The history of leisure studies has been reviewed by Page and Connell \(2010\), with land-  
mark studies identified in Page and Connell \(2006\). Its modern-day roots can be traced to  
the parks and recreation movement in North America in the mid-nineteenth century. The  
pursuit of different forms of leisure research informed by sociology continued from the early  
twentieth century \(1920s and 1930s\). Development of the outdoor ethos towards recreation  
saw a significant boom in Europe in the early twentieth century, albeit constrained by the  
availability of leisure time. In many countries professionals working in recreation and park  
management are responsible for the provision and management of parks, recreation facilities,  
and leisure programmes and services. Their skill sets range from venue planning, manage-  
ment, and marketing to community development and therapeutic recreation programming. 398

Commercial recreation requires knowledge of business management and tourism. Hospitality  
services are often integrated into leisure facilities, and events are both users of these facilities  
and elements in leisure programming. The important contributions of leisure studies to Event  
Studies begin with our understanding of event experiences, and the importance of intrinsic  
and extrinsic motivation, as not all event experiences are necessarily considered to be leisure  
by those involved.  
We looked at serious leisure, a theory that helps explain engagement and involvement in  
events, as well as the event travel career trajectory. It applies to hobbyists, volunteers, and var-  
ious social worlds associated with all leisure pursuits. The basic differences between intrinsic  
and extrinsic motivations are important, especially when it comes to business events versus  
leisure events – and how they often overlap. Leisure constraints and how they are negotiated  
or overcome are an important part of our discussion of antecedents and the decision-making  
process. Also consider how substitution works, with many leisure and other benefits of events  
being generic and therefore available through other outlets \(Table 16.14\).

The study of sport as it relates to events has many foundations in the traditional disciplines,  
especially psychology and sociology, with additional grounding in physical sciences when  
examining athletes and their performance. Sport management focuses on sport organisations,  
such as professional clubs and public facilities, with specific interests in sport marketing,  
human resources, finance, organisational structure, organisational behaviour, ethics, informa-  
tion technology, policy development, and communications \(North American Society for Sport  
Management; www.nassm.com\). NASSM’s Journal of Sport Management carries articles on sport  
events and sport tourism, which are of particular interest to Event Studies. This covers partici-  
pation sports \(including the event travel career trajectory\) and sport venues. Mega-sport events  
often dominate political and economic discussions of events, given their scale and cost, and we  
looked closely at purported benefits and the nature of legacy planning. Discussions of health  
and personal development benefits figure prominently in sport and recreational events, both  
as motivators and potential outcomes. Sport event volunteering is a huge area \(Table 16.15\).

# Visitor Studies  
Visitor studies is an interdisciplinary theme, and a set of methods, with its own professional  
association and research journal. The Visitor Studies Association \(www.visitorstudies.org\)  
focuses on all facets of the visitor experience in settings like museums, zoos, nature centres,  
visitor centres, historic sites, parks, and other informal learning settings. The purpose of related  
research and evaluation is to understand and enhance visitor experiences in informal learning  
settings. Obviously, tourism, hospitality, leisure, arts, and Event Studies are all concerned with  
visitors and their experiences \(Table 16.16\).

grammes are integrated within business schools, and in some cases with sport and leisure as  
well \(Table 16.17\).

# Gender Studies  
This is a diverse, interdisciplinary field, in that many foundation disciplines contribute and are  
informed by it. Definitions of the field vary according to the content of pertinent university  
programmes, and where researchers and commentators choose to focus. It is widely suggested  
that the origins lie in women’s studies and have subsequently expanded to include the following\:  
men’s studies; sexuality, power, and identity; queer studies, and expansion to include LGBTQ+.  
Many contributors to this diverse field concentrate on gender roles and related themes of  
power, inclusion, and discrimination, thereby linking with wider aspects of critical studies and  
social justice. Others focus on self-perception, that is whether one identifies as male, female or  
other \(i.e., LGBTQ+\). Researchers study constructions of gender in society, including politics  
and power, gendered representation, and gender identity \(socially constructed\) related to race,  
ethnicity, sexuality, religion, reproduction, and reproductive rights. Others focus on norms and  
cultural values related to “being” a boy, girl, man, or woman.  
The terms gender and sex are often confused or used interchangeably. To be clear on what is  
being discussed, the following distinctions are important\:  
Gender\: According to the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) \(https\://www.who.int/health-  
topics/gender\),  
Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially  
constructed. This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being  
a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other. As a social  
construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time.  
Sex refers to physical distinctions, or natal sex \(i.e., sex organs and chromosomes\). Sex in the  
modern world can be changed, resulting in controversy – such as competition in sports labelled  
male or female.  
Sexuality refers to sexual orientation and behaviour, and is therefore a highly personal, evolving,  
and potentially diverse state of being.  
LGBTQ+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, questioning/queer, and sexual/gender diverse;  
IA, when added, means intersex and asexual.  
A number of themes are beyond the scope of this book, but we examine several of particular  
importance to events. The first is inclusiveness versus exclusion, or who is involved, who ben-  
efits, and why some are excluded. For example, Denison, Bevan, and Jeanes \(2021\) reviewed  
the literature on sport organisations related to exclusion and discrimination experienced by  
LGBTQ+ people, finding strong evidence of widespread discriminatory behaviour that causes  
harm.  
Representation\: This issue pertains both to the ability of women or LGBTQ+ to gain employ-  
ment, or be part of the programming on equal terms and to how they are portrayed at events.  
Crees et al. \(2022\) studied media influences on perceptions of LGBTQIA+ pride in the UK,  
documenting a shift in representations that were positive and influential.  
Sexual Harassment and Violence at Events\: This has emerged as a major issue for many outdoor  
music festivals, requiring not only the education of attendees but in many cases police action.  
Wadds et al. \(2022\) linked sexual violence and harassment to drugs, alcohol, and a culture of  
‘hedonistic self-indulgence’ at large, camping-oriented, Australian music festivals. The researchers  
aimed to uncover reasons for transgressive behaviour, in the form of sexual violence, related  
to ‘situational, environmental and gendered dynamics’. Their review of the literature suggests that Table 16.18 Gender Studies

# Health Studies  
The relationships between events and health came to the fore at the beginning of the pandemic  
in 2020, with the term superspreader quickly entering the vernacular. One of the first to attract  
international media attention was the New Orleans Mardi Gras, with scientists confirming  
that it resulted in a rapid spread of Covid-19. “Our findings show how a single, large-scale social event  
can play a major role in kick-starting a viral epidemic when no restrictions are in place”, source\: https\://

elements of risk management, security, customer service, and regulations. Event tourism is  
obviously impacted by disease, real or threatened, and this highlights the major role of travel  
medicine in informing event management and hosting \(Table 16.19\).

STUDY GUIDE  
Foundation disciplines and closely related professional fields were discussed as to their links  
with, and contributions to, Event Studies. The related academic fields and associated pro-  
fessions all involve events to some extent, so the discipline of Event Studies, as it develops,  
can feed back important concepts to them. Note how each field has to draw upon foundation  
disciplines for theory and methodology, and how the ways in which they apply theory suggest  
possibilities and direct applications for Event Studies. Leisure studies offers the most in terms 406  
Foundation Disciplines and Closely Related Fields  
of theory and philosophy because that field is specifically concerned with events and experi-  
ences. Several leisure theories and methods are vital in helping to explain motivations to attend  
events and event tourism. They have also developed a philosophy of leisure service that might  
be applicable to events. Refer to previous chapters in linking theory from disciplines to Event  
Studies and event management.

ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
# Introduction  
This is not a chapter on research methods, although many are mentioned. It is intended to  
provide an overview of the entire knowledge creation and research process, starting with a  
conceptual model, and then proceeding to a discussion of basic research paradigms, methodol-  
ogies, and methods. Research lies at the heart of knowledge creation for the purposes of devel-  
oping theory, but researchers are not the only ones creating knowledge. Most event-related  
research has stemmed from sheer curiosity, or from a management or policy need. As Event  
Studies is a relatively new field, a lot of pertinent research has been within well-established,  
disciplinary lines of inquiry and closely related fields. To progress towards interdisciplinarity,  
wherein Event Studies will have its own theories and methodologies, we will have to focus  
more on the core phenomenon and related themes.  
# Sources of Knowledge  
Figure 17.1 depicts the various ways in which knowledge can be created, and also points to  
where a research project can begin. At the centre is our field of Event Studies, showing that  
we rely on established disciplines and closely related professional fields for ideas, theories, and  
methods. Knowledge creation also follows from the needs of managers who conduct research,  
evaluations, impact studies, and engage in observation and reflective thought about issues  
and problems. Policymakers need input, leading to research and stakeholder engagement. The  
think-tank approach is often used in other fields where future scenarios are commonly made,  
but seldom applied to events. Grounded research is singled out from other methodologies for  
the reason that it is seldom applied in its true form, being research without foreknowledge or  
assumptions.  
As discussed in previous chapters, methodologies from foundation disciplines have dominated  
in their contribution to Event Studies, sometimes filtered through the lens of applied fields like  
leisure studies. Event researchers have in many cases followed interdisciplinary approaches

tions back to the foundation disciplines and other fields.  
Pernecky \(2023\) has examined the alternatives and pointed to the postdisciplinary approach as  
being by far the most contentious because it is based on abolishing disciplinary knowledge.  
This approach is found in the creation of new focal points of research and theory building, such  
as gender studies, that are not rooted in any one discipline. The idea is to examine the phenom-  
enon in question, as opposed to being constrained by the methods or modes of inquiry that a  
disciplinary approach uses. In the context of re-examining the co-creation concept for events,  
Pernecky \(2023\) made the following argument against reliance on traditional methodologies\:  
Despite their place and use in disciplinary lines of inquiry, they are often inadequate for  
comprehending changeable and complex webs of relation. Postdisciplinary approaches  
to knowledge seek to overcome these limitations by promoting disciplinary flexibility  
and methodological freedom to think anew\: to think creatively, out of the box, and  
even disobediently.

# Philosophy and Knowledge  
What is knowledge? How do we know anything? These questions are at the heart of epistemol-  
ogy, methodology, and ontology. Disciplines have their own perspectives on ways to conduct  
research, often reflected in one or more research paradigms. Science and the pursuit of knowl-  
edge are not the same. Scientific method is all about a prescribed process and theory building,  
whereas knowledge can be developed from original thinking \(creativity\), synthesis \(reflective  
thought by informed, wise people\), and serendipity \(unplanned discovery\). In this section, a  
number of important terms and concepts are examined so that event researchers will under-  
stand where their work fits into the bigger picture of science and knowledge creation. It will  
become clear that there is a lot of disagreement about the very meaning or usefulness of science  
and scientific method.  
Philosophy of science consists of the philosophical foundations, assumptions, and implications of  
natural and social sciences. It seeks to explain such things as the nature of scientific statements  
and concepts, and the formulation and use of the scientific method.  
Epistemology specifically deals with knowledge, the relationships between the knower and that  
which is to be known, and the justification of knowledge claims. Modern science is dominated  
by empiricists who believe that all knowledge is ultimately derived from some experience that  
requires research and analysis. Adapting Tribe’s \(1997, 639\) approach to tourism studies, the  
epistemology of Event Studies should be concerned with creating knowledge about planned events,  
the sources of such knowledge, the validity and reliability of claims of knowledge, the use of  
concepts, the boundaries of Event Studies, and the categorisation of Event Studies as a disci-  
pline or field. If we limit Event Studies to the use of scientific methods, we will miss out on large  
parts of the world of planned events that are not scientifically quantifiable. Event Studies needs  
greater epistemological breadth, encompassing philosophical, moral, aesthetic, historical, and  
sociological inquiry and discourse.  
Ontology is a branch of philosophy concerning the origins, essence, and meaning of being, or  
what it means to exist. It can also be defined as dealing with conceptualisations of reality. In  
research, ontology usually refers to how knowledge is represented, and the vocabulary being  
used to describe it. In the social sciences, there are four main ontological approaches. Realism is  
based on the idea that the truth is out there, or that researchers can indeed discover facts and 410  
ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
establish a true picture of reality. For example, marketing researchers might believe they can  
determine exactly who prefers certain types of events, and why. This leads to empirical research,  
and it can be said that empiricism entails making observations about the real world, which can  
be evaluated in relation to facts.  
Empiricism is what separates science from philosophy or theology. Positivism is the scientific  
approach most associated with experimentation, quantitative techniques, and the assumption  
that researchers are discovering the truth. The fourth ontological approach, post-modernism,  
rejects the notion that we discover the truth through empiricism, and proclaims that every  
observation or measurement is open to interpretation.  
*Discourse and Critical Discourse*  
Discourse can be narrowly defined as a conversation, or in a more formalised way as a rule-based  
dialogue among parties. An event can be interpreted as a discourse, or forum for discourses,  
with Crespi-Vallbona and Richards \(2007\) viewing festivals as “arenas of discourse enabling people  
to express their views on wider cultural, social and political issues”. Foucault \(1969\) saw discourse  
as a system of ideas or knowledge, with its own vocabulary. This can result in the power to  
monopolise communications and debate, and to enforce particular points of view. Following  
the arguments of Foucault, we can view discourse as a system, or structured line of reason-  
ing, ideas, and approaches to knowledge creation, including theory development and practical  
applications. Meaning is assigned within a discourse, based on researchers’ values, so that the  
language and concepts define and delimit what is legitimate or expected of those contributing  
to it.  
In academic and political discourse some understandings can be marginalised or ignored com-  
pletely. For example, Tribe \(2004, 57\) argued that “the business discourse” in tourism has “some  
coherence and structure, and a framework of theories and concepts \(borrowed from the field of business  
studies\)”, and that tourism studies tends to crystallise around this interdisciplinary approach.  
Translated into the subject of this book, the business discourse becomes event tourism and is  
also applicable to the profession of event management.  
Discourse on any subject, such as a political process for determining support for cultural festi-  
vals, involves two-way or multi-stakeholder communications, with the aim of ensuring mutual  
understanding. It is a rule-based process in which arguments are evaluated for their validity,  
and it facilitates shared decision-making or consensus-building. Stating one’s opinion is not  
discourse, nor is propaganda and advertising. Argument without rules is not discourse. Allow-  
ing statements to be made that cannot be verified as fact or source violates the principles of  
discourse.  
Proof and evidence  
As covered within the context of evaluation and impact assessment, the nature of the evidence  
is a critical point. Often it will be a social construct, which is an agreed-upon set of measures and  
methods \(including key performance and impact indicators\) by stakeholders in the evaluation  
process. These are ideally formulated within logic or theory of change models. Those inclined  
towards extrinsic valuation, as with the economics of event tourism, usually want quantifi-  
ables, often expressed in monetary terms, while those more interested in social and cultural  
goals and impacts might very well accept the voices of people as valid evidence. These voices  
can be in the form of opinions, stories, attitudes, and arguments. ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies In terms of theory building, accumulating evidence will have to be subjected to meta-analysis,  
and that requires the use of standardised methods and measures. Meta-analysis involves statis-  
tical analysis of many studies that explore the same phenomenon, and it is the gold standard in  
medicine and drug testing. To date, we have seen limited scope for this methodology in Event  
Studies because of a lack of standardisation.  
411  
*Research Methodologies and Methods*  
Each discipline has its traditional and favoured methodologies, but they are not rigidly applied.  
In contemporary academics, inter-, multi- or trans-disciplinary research is often preferred,  
using mixed methods, while postmodernists and critical theorists will reject all notions of the  
right way to do research or build theory.  
Methods are the ways in which research is done, or actions accomplished. The traditional sep-  
aration of quantitative and qualitative methods still holds, but as mentioned above, mixed  
methods are often preferred, and more revealing.  
*Research Purposes and Methods*  
Veal \(2006, 3\) provided a typology of research from the perspective of its purpose or utility, and  
examples can be found throughout this book.  
Exploratory or descriptive research seeks to uncover facts or describe a situation. This simplest type  
of research is commonplace in emerging fields and might consist of inventories, mapping, and  
classifications of events, case histories, profiles of event organisations, or compilations of facts  
about policies and regulations affecting the event sector. A trend analysis of demand for events  
is descriptive, whereas an analysis of factors causing the trend is explanatory.  
Explanatory research seeks understanding. In a positivist tradition, there is often an assumption  
of cause and effect, such as the growth in demand for entertainment events is explained by the  
rise of disposable incomes enabling more people to engage in hedonistic pursuits. If we can  
explain why something happens, then a predictive model should be possible.  
Evaluative research is essential in event management and in policy development. As discussed in  
the context of a systems model, internal evaluation of an organisation’s effectiveness \(in attain-  
ing goals\) and efficiency \(the best use of its resources\) is the responsibility of management.  
External evaluation is conducted by stakeholders who want to know if their investment or sup-  
port for the event has been worthwhile, or for stakeholders and experts to examine the impacts  
of events. Theory of change models can be used for evaluation and theory building, with each  
iteration of the model \(incorporating feedback and revisions, new goals, and action pathways\)  
contributing to a better understanding of reality \(i.e., theory development\).  
Quantitative methods are associated with positivism, and qualitative with interpretivism, but  
there is absolutely no reason why both cannot be combined in any given piece of event-related  
research or evaluation. The difference is not one of good technique, but of what you need to  
know and how best to find it out. Often an exploratory, qualitative stage, using focus groups,  
interviews, and observation, precedes a more quantitative stage.  
Qualitative methods generally do not attempt a numerical analysis and are more focused on  
­ discovering people’s attitudes, feelings, motives, or perhaps meanings attached to an event  
experience. Often the numbers of respondents involved are small, as the appropriate methods 412  
ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
\(e.g., participant observation, interviews, focus groups\) are time-consuming. Of special inter-  
est might be the interactions between people in a focus group setting, which need to be  
recorded and later interpreted, or perhaps the language used by people in a self-reporting  
situation.  
Grounded Research \(Glaser and Strauss, 1967\), also known as grounded theory, is a methodolog-  
ical approach that emphasises inductive reasoning, data collection, and analysis. The basic idea  
is to generate theories from empirical data, starting with either a question or some qualitative  
data – not with a theory or disciplinary methodology. In three stages, data are coded and cat-  
egorised, and emergent theory is identified and explored. Grounded research emphasises the  
importance of context and the subjective experiences of individuals. There is potential to con-  
tribute to Event Studies, but so far this challenging methodology has been used infrequently  
\(see\: Biaett, 2013; Sun et al., 2019; Werner et al., 2020\).  
# Review of Review Articles  
Periodic reviews of the event-specific literature have been published, each of which provides  
insights into the development of the field and its three main discourses. This supplements the  
discussion in Chapter 1 of how the field of Event Studies has evolved, but in this section we  
are particularly interested in the maturing of research and theory development, with a view to  
establishing a research agenda.  
Table 17.1 summarises the available articles, most being from accessible journals, while a few  
are from book chapters and conference proceedings. In the fourth edition of this book, more  
detail was provided in each review, whereas in this edition the focus is on the topical summary.  
Most of these reviews pertain to planned events in general, and a minority are specific to either  
festivals or business events. Sports have been rather neglected, in terms of systematic reviews.  
The reviews have concentrated on published journal articles in English, and while that is some-  
what of a limitation, it does accurately reflect the research and theory development dimensions  
of Event Studies while omitting the wisdom of book and chapter authors. The obvious limita-  
tion is that other languages are not included.  
Collectively these reviews shed light on the nature and evolution of Event Studies, specifying  
research topics and methods employed, with most authors also identifying perceived gaps and  
desired lines of research. Unfortunately, there has been little attention given in these reviews  
to the theories being used in Event Studies, although the identified research gaps and recom-  
mended research topics and methods do suggest avenues of theory development.  
There were very few articles specific to events published before 1993, as that year saw the  
establishment of the journal Festival Management and Event Tourism \(renamed to Event Management  
in 1999\). The first review articles were therefore published in the 1990s. Since the year 2000,  
there has been a documented surge in event-specific articles in both event-specific journals and  
elsewhere. The most recent reviews bring us up to literature published in 2022, although in  
this fifth edition of Event Studies, you will find many citations of books and articles from the  
first third of 2023.  
As with new academic fields, the early years were marked by a great number of descriptive  
studies, as well as quantitative papers with data collection by surveys from single events.

*Summarising the Reviews*  
Review articles only partially explore the evolution of Event Studies, as books and other  
material are generally omitted. As a supplement, it is suggested that a systematic review be  
conducted of professional and academic associations and their publications, conference pro-  
ceedings, technical manuals, published and online expert sources \(much of which is opinion  
based on practical experience\), and other inputs. Covering languages other than English will  
be necessary for a complete overview, but that is a very challenging goal.  
There will always be a lag in the published literature, as it can take years to get reviews con-  
ducted and published, and it does appear that the evolution of the field is accelerating in terms  
of scope and sophistication. Indicators of this acceleration include the growing number and  
diversity of books, growth in the number of research articles and journals that accommodate  
event-themed articles, and the emergence of areas of specialisation \(or research themes\) such  
as Critical Event Studies. 416  
ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
Festivals  
The Getz review \(2010\) of festivals was the largest conducted in terms of the number of jour-  
nals and articles, systematically covering 17 journals and using bibliographic searches to find  
articles on festivals wherever they had been published. It was a thematic review, first placing  
analysis into the categories of antecedents, planning/management, experiences, outcomes, pat-  
terns and processes, then into three discourses\: festival tourism, festival management, and dis-  
ciplinary perspectives. The following ‘classical’ themes were identified, largely drawing from the  
anthropological and sociological disciplines and applied to festivals to varying extents\: myth,  
ritual, and symbolism; ceremony and celebration; spectacle; communitas; host-guest interac-  
tions \(and the role of the stranger\); liminality, the carnivalesque, and festivity; authenticity  
and commodification; pilgrimage; and a considerable amount of political debate over impacts  
and meanings. Dominating the festival tourism discourse was the assessment of economic  
impacts, planning and marketing for destinations, and studies of festival tourism motivation  
and various segmentation approaches. The negative impacts of festivals and festival tourism  
were identified as a more recent line of research. A number of research gaps were pinpointed,  
including\: cross-case and cross-cultural studies \(see Getz, Andersson and Carlsen, 2010\);  
whole populations of festivals; longitudinal research; experiences or the meanings attached to  
them; phenomenological \(hermeneutics\) and experiential assessment; both experimental and  
participant observation techniques; using environmental psychology theory; and choice mod-  
elling. Greater interdisciplinarity in theory development was needed. As well, Getz concluded  
that the three discourses do not generally inform each other, and cross-over research is rare.  
Wilson et al. \(2017\) found the dominant themes in the literature to be motivation, experience,  
place, impacts, and the management of festivals. They noted increasing attention to qualitative  
and mixed methods. The authors called for more longitudinal research, paradigmatic diversity,  
and theory building drawing from social sciences. More testing and refinement of scales \(e.g.,  
social impact\) was said to be needed. Wilson et al. developed a graphic model for explaining  
their research agenda, containing four themes\: pre-festival; partnerships; resources; and pro-  
cesses in staging festivals.  
Gouthro and Fox \(2019\) searched the literature on festivals and found that 33 countries were  
covered in published articles. They noted the dominance of quantitative methods, particularly  
using surveys to gather data, but showed that qualitative methods are receiving greater accep-  
tance. Some of the pioneering methods being used reflect the trend to incorporate mixed meth-  
ods in research projects, including elicitation of memories about festival experiences, personal  
meaning mapping, having respondents write empathy-based stories, role-playing, focus groups,  
and netnography pertaining to online communications about events. As to challenges for fes-  
tival research, Gouthro and Fox pointed to the requirements for data protection, especially in  
relation to ‘big data’, and discussed the ethics of research - as this is an issue of increasing con-  
cern both to academics and the participants. They also raised concerns about how the academic  
community may be influenced by the demands of governmental monitoring and measurements.  
Sports  
More thorough reviews of the sport event literature are definitely needed, as it tends to be a  
sub-theme within sport management, and is only a major theme in the journal Sport and Tour-  
ism. Many research articles published in tourism, hospitality, sport, leisure, and event-specific  
journals pertain to sport events, so the issues cross over many perspectives. There is no argu-  
ment with the fact that large-scale, international sport events \(i.e., mega-events\) have attracted  
the most attention, with Olympics-related research arguably being a distinct sub-field. Parent ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies and Chappelet \(2015\) based their comments on the contents of the Routledge Handbook of  
Sports Event Management, concluding that more attention is needed by researchers on small-  
scale and community sport events. They called for more critical approaches and argued that  
a greater diversity of theoretical lenses should be employed. That Handbook adopted a stake-  
holder perspective, so is somewhat limited in its coverage.  
Gibson \(2017\) discussed theory development for sport tourism, much of which applies to  
Event Studies. She noted \(p. 154\),  
Concepts such as leverage \(Chalip, 2004\), applications of Turner’s \(1969\) ­ theory  
of ritual process in the form of the social leveraging of communitas \(Chalip, 2006\),  
and more recently the concept of the event portfolio \(Ziakas, 2010; Ziakas & Cos-  
ta, 2011\) have been used to build knowledge with a particular focus on events and  
­ maximizing the outcomes of events by changing the mindset from ‘impact’ to a  
­ process of maximization of benefit, or what has come to be known as event leverage  
\(Chalip, 2004\).  
Getz \(2008\) with an application of serious leisure \(Stebbins, 1982 – leisure stud-  
ies\) and the travel career ladder/pattern \(Pearce, 1988; Pearce & Lee, 2005 – tourism  
studies\) proposed the idea of an event travel career which has subsequently been used  
to understand participation in active sport tourism contexts \(e.g. Buning & Gibson,  
2015; Getz & Anderson, 2010; Getz & McConnell, 2011\).  
One glaring need identified by Gibson \(2017\) was research on women’s experiences, for which  
a feminist perspective would be informative.  
Gammon et al. \(2017, 69–70\) also commented on sport tourism theory\:  
Whilst inter-disciplinarity is a key feature of sport, tourism and sport tourism  
research, what is lacking is any significant evidence of theoretical reciprocity from  
those situated within business schools \(e.g., economist, marketing and management  
scholars\), the humanities \(geographers and historians\) or the social sciences  
\(e.g., psychologists, sociologist, anthropologists\).  
Gammon also argued that the field of sport tourism has been slow to develop because theories  
have not been used to reveal something new about the field – a caveat that is certainly applicable  
to Event Studies in general. Theories from outside the field should be adapted or augmented,  
and in turn that will contribute to a wider understanding of behaviour and experiences.  
The most recent and thorough review of sport events was published by Bazzanella et al. \(2023\),  
revealing major themes in the research literature\: risks; characteristics and attributes of sport  
events; brand; image; hosting; impacts, and legacy. Mega-events tend to dominate. The authors  
called for more research on sustainability efforts, using sport events to transform destinations  
into attractions, the event tourism experience from different stakeholder perspectives, and media  
technology to enhance experiences. New methods and metrics are needed for small and medium-  
sized events. The links between event image and destination image should be examined in  
different contexts, and project management was almost completely absent from the literature.  
417  
BusineSS events  
The MICE sector \(Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions – or Events\) has been  
a focal area for many researchers and academically tends to be tied mostly to hospitality and  
tourism studies. Mair \(2012\), however, noted that the I in MICE, usually standing for incentive  
travel, has mostly been ignored by researchers. It should also be remembered that the Journal 418  
ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
Festival Management and Event Tourism excluded business event papers by editorial policy through  
five volumes, and only in 2000 – with the new name Event Management – did it seek to include  
all types of planned events.  
Carlsen’s review \(1999\) was confined to Asia and Australia. The literature he canvassed was  
heavily oriented towards economic impact studies, leading Carlsen to propose a more com-  
prehensive research agenda. Subsequent reviews of business event research by Yoo and Weber  
\(2005\) and Lee and Back \(2005\) were more comprehensive. Yoo and Weber determined that  
marketing and consumer behaviour topics dominated, with a focus on meeting planners. Event  
administration and strategy were other important topics. Those authors said there is a need for  
more conceptual pieces and a triple-bottom-line approach to impacts. Lee and Back noted that  
descriptive research had dominated, and major themes in the literature were site selection by  
associations, destination marketing, and economic impacts.  
Mair \(2012\) observed a lack of rigour in business event research and lamented there has been  
little research on social or environmental impacts. One review of exhibition-related research  
was conducted by Lee and Lee \(2014\). They noted that most research was conducted on trade  
shows, focusing on exhibitors and organisers, as opposed to consumer shows. Four themes  
were assessed\: motives to attend; the role of visitors in the buying centre; service marketing,  
and site selection criteria. Lee and Lee proclaimed the need for more research on visitors and  
their perceptions of exhibition quality.  
In the Routledge Handbook of Business Events \(2023\), Le’s review suggests the need for theoretical  
development in the study of business events. He noted an increasing interest in exhibitions,  
including site selection and design to improve visitor experiences. Planning, evaluation, and  
technology are contemporary themes of note, and in particular, Le pointed out the rise of  
hybrid and virtual events resulting from the pandemic. These trends might result in changes to  
consumer behaviour, with implications for destinations.  
Event tourism  
The reviews by Getz \(2008\) and Getz and Page \(2016\) covered the event tourism research  
literature in-depth – conceptually, chronologically, and thematically. Getz \(2008\) identified  
key research questions and related, possible methods. The literature review was updated and  
expanded by Getz and Page \(2016\) who utilised the framework for understanding and creat-  
ing knowledge about events. Particular attention was given to established research themes  
and concepts, constraining and propelling forces, ontological advances, contributions from key  
journals, and emerging themes and issues. This review presented a roadmap for research activ-  
ity in event tourism and the research questions have been incorporated in this chapter.  
A separate review by Kim, Boo, and Kim \(2013\) observed that event tourism articles were  
dominated by the impact of international scale sport events, but increased interest was noted  
in participants, residents, and event tourists. Those authors called for more attention to  
behavioural and psychological factors of event tourism, and for non-economic impact studies.  
Duignan \(2023\) reviewed articles published in the Annals of Tourism Research and its companion  
research journal. Trends were documented, such as a pronounced shift from the early emphasis  
on economic impacts, marketing, and motivations to attend events, through a growing focus on  
social impacts and benefits, to a more recent theme on events as platforms for social critique  
and protest. Duignan stressed that events have become central to the experience economy, and  
research on events contributes to theory development in tourism and other fields because they  
are unique organisations and occur in diverse spaces. ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies 419  
*Pandemic-Specific Review*  
Pandemic-related research began quickly in 2020, as it was obvious that major disruption was  
occurring, with potentially long-lasting structural changes. The researchers could build upon  
previous work concerning SARS, but SARS was internationally a minor disruption and 2020  
introduced a worst-case scenario. Many publications were already available in early 2023, and  
no doubt more will come. As argued elsewhere in this book, researchers need to look at a  
number of potential structural impacts, including effects on the event population \(how many  
failures occurred, were new events created?\), funding \(have government policies and corpo-  
rate sponsorships changed?\), consumer demand and behaviour \(have preferences and patterns  
changed?\) and the nature of event experiences \(especially related to virtual and hybrid events\).  
A review of literature by Seraphin \(2021\) found that most of the early Covid-related publica-  
tions were not specifically about events, while in the tourism literature there were many. That  
review identified two themes, the first on negative impacts, most of which have been obvi-  
ous, and the second on opportunities. What could be the positive outcomes? Re-consideration  
of how things work or do not work \(e.g., why events and organisations failed\), determining  
the best methods of resilience planning, or identifying new education and training needs and  
methods might emerge.

EXPERT OPINION 17.1\: By Dr. Sandra Goh  
Event Sector Recovery in New Zealand  
Sandra is a Tourism & Event Senior Lecturer; Programme Leader, and Bachelor of  
Arts in Event Management, at School of Hospitality & Tourism, Auckland University of  
Technology.  
While things in New Zealand may look like they are back to normal after the travel  
restriction was lifted in September 2022 \(see Plate 17.1\), the impact of the pandemic  
and ongoing challenges with climate change calls for a new strategy from the govern-  
ment and event organisers to remain sustainable.  
A Delphi study conducted with event experts revealed that jobs lost in the event envi-  
ronment were more than in other industries. This affects the supply chain of events  
bringing about a shortage of labour and forcing the shutdown of smaller companies  
that were unable to withstand the impact of the pandemic. The loss of labour was seen  
by the exit of event talent, as organisations restructured to remain viable. Higher oper-  
ating costs are expected as the services of event specialists become available under the  
operation of fewer competitors.  
Condé Nast Traveler \(2022\) named Auckland, New Zealand one of the best places to  
visit in 2023 because of an eventful year. Many of these events were postponed due

to the lockdown and received funding that was granted pre-Covid. However, funding  
for events under the New Zealand Government’s national tourism recovery is limited.  
To compete for visitors post-Covid, competition for international events is keener than  
ever between countries that depend on events to boost their economies. Bidding for  
international events requires a big budget. To compete on a more sustainable means,  
New Zealand business experts and the government urged the private sector to build  
on homegrown events instead of international events. Among the suggestions are fresh  
ideas to attract visitors \(Williams, 2022\).  
On a more positive note, Tourism New Zealand and Auckland Convention Bureau seem  
to be heading in the right direction in terms of wooing international business visitors  
to New Zealand with the support of industry leaders and academics. Tourism New  
Zealand’s Conference Assistance Programme is available to any association or organ-  
isation, including universities, that wants to bid to host an international conference in  
New Zealand with a minimum of 200 international delegates \(ttgmice, 2022\). With  
this strategy, bidding for the right event is just as important as getting the tourist traffic  
through to New Zealand. For example, a host destination for a Rotary International  
Convention in 2024 would expect 25,000 delegates \(Mui, 2017\).  
Even after the pandemic, New Zealand is witnessing new challenges with climate  
change.  
A recent study \(Frame et al., 2020\) found that \$140M of the total \$470M in damages  
from the 12 worst flood events in New Zealand over the period 2007–2017 were directly  
attributable to climate change. Elton John’s final show in Auckland was cancelled less  
than half an hour before he was set to take to the stage as torrential rain wreaked havoc  
across Auckland in January 2023.  
Moving forward, change is necessary to bring about transformation within the event  
economy without compromising on event risk management. The debate continues on  
whether events should be offered under a hybrid model – to allow both in-person and  
virtual experiences.

ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
# Research Agenda and Major Challenges  
This section is shaped by our framework for knowledge creation \(Figure 1.3\), starting with the  
core of planned events and event experiences and followed by antecedents, planning and man-  
agement, outcomes and the impacts, and finally patterns and processes. The research agenda  
builds on those published in previous editions of Event Studies by incorporating ideas from  
review articles and our own coverage of the literature. Themes and questions remain important  
over a long time period, but new ones do keep appearing. Suggested theoretical foundations  
can apply to more than one of these agendas. New theoretical perspectives and methods also  
keep appearing, and that is definitely a good sign for the advancement of Event Studies.  
*Event Experiences and Meanings*  
This is the core of Event Studies and therefore demands constant attention from researchers  
and theorists. The core separates Event Studies from other fields, but also brings several closely  
related fields to the table. According to Borrie and Birzell \(2001\), there have been four common  
approaches to studying visitor experiences, namely, a focus on satisfaction, benefits, experi-  
ences, and meanings. The satisfaction approach is really about using surrogate measures, as it asks  
if people were satisfied with their experiences – not what those experiences were or what they  
meant. Expectation-confirmation theory lies at the heart of this line of research, recognising  
that many event attendees \(but not all\) will have expectations of quality and experiences, and  
these are shaped by both past experience, marketing, and other personal or cultural antecedents.  
An alternative is to indirectly measure satisfaction through observation or technology that per-  
mits the monitoring of what people do and where they go – leading to conclusions about what  
appealed to them and what did not \(e.g., hot and cold spots\). The literature on services mar-  
keting has informed many event-specific studies, the more sophisticated of which employ tech-  
niques like importance-performance, service mapping, and technology-based tracking. In line  
with the generic marketing literature, many papers have been published linking satisfaction  
with antecedents \(i.e., motivations, expectations, involvement, demographics, past event expe-  
riences, and lifestyle\) with quality perceptions and forward to future intentions \(i.e., loyalty,  
repeat visits, personal recommendations\). Structural equation modelling has been a favourite  
tool, but it has to be remembered that this does not develop new theory, it serves to confirm  
hypotheses that must emerge from theory.  
The benefits approach asks respondents to indicate their level of agreement with statements  
regarding the benefits they might have received, such as escaping, relaxing, learning, etc.  
It is similar to asking about motivations to attend an event. A priority here is examining and  
comparing motives/benefits at all types of events, in different cultures and settings. Leisure  
researchers have paid particular attention to benefits, partly to justify leisure services by  
demonstrating the personal, social, and cultural benefits – and this leads to the issue of how  
events might be transforming experiences, or to consideration of cumulative impacts. We can  
also observe this line of research in recent work on event experiences and quality of life, but  
mostly it is manifested in comprehensive impact assessments that take into account different  
stakeholders and value perspectives. Asking “what is the value or worth of this event” brings  
benefits and meanings to the fore.  
Experience-based methods involve reporting on thoughts, feelings, or moods during daily life,  
a trip, or event. Phenomenological approaches should be a top priority in Event Studies, par-  
ticularly for gaining a better theoretical understanding of immediate conscious experience.  
Experiential sampling and the various forms of experience and meaning mapping should be  
utilised in a variety of event circumstances. Autoethnographic methods have emerged as a way ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies to explore the meanings of experiences. A big question for theorists has been to ask how events  
can be a transforming experience for attendees and other participants, and that links to involve-  
ment, engagement, and meanings. A meanings-based approach requires deep insights obtained  
through participant observation or interviews, or the application of hermeneutic phenomenol-  
ogy wherein life-enriching stories are elicited. We need considerably more research on social  
and personal constructs of event meanings, and how these vary over time and cross-culturally.  
Virtual and Hybrid Experiences can no longer be ignored, thanks in large part to the pandemic.  
Researchers will have to continue looking at possible structural changes in the events and  
tourism sectors arising from the pandemic, including the event population, how event port-  
folios are being affected, and changes in consumer behaviour, funding, and sponsorship. As  
to the experience, there is no doubt that live events offer different, and for many people pre-  
ferred social experiences and quite possibly better educational experiences. How virtuality can  
enhance social experiences, especially networking, and provide more and different value prop-  
ositions to users is a very practical challenge for designers.  
Technology continues to evolve and offer new opportunities for enhancing event experiences.  
This is both a research challenge and a very important element in contemporary event design.  
Obviously, virtual and hybrid event experiences are directly influenced by available technology,  
and therefore designers will be looking for enhancements. Live events will also be exploiting  
technology for communications and marketing improvements, direct and live interaction with  
guests, and augmentation of on-site experiences \(Table 17.2\).  
423  
*Antecedents and Choices*  
Motivation to attend events, and for event tourism, has been a well-explored topic, with recent  
theory development specific to events including a fuller adoption of leisure theory which in  
turn draws upon social psychology. Consideration of serious leisure, social worlds, ego involve-  
ment, identity, and constraint negotiation have informed the Event Travel Career Trajectory.  
Leisure constraints theory offers considerable scope for examining why some people attend  
events and others do not. Constraint negotiation applied to intrinsically and extrinsically moti-  
vated event attendance should be examined. Economic theories and methods should be applied  
to gain a better understanding of supply and demand issues that influence event attendance,  
particularly willingness to pay and pricing.  
A new issue has emerged, being the option of avoiding live events and attending only virtual  
events \(Table 17.3\). This makes some sense in the workplace for meetings and conferences,  
even exhibitions, but does it have any prospect of taking hold in the realms of celebration and  
entertainment? Will the metaverse offer some people better choices than live events?  
*Outcomes and the Impacted*  
An over-emphasis on the economic impacts of events and event tourism impeded comprehen-  
sive theory and methodological development for many years. However, growing acceptance of  
the sustainability and social responsibility paradigm has led to considerable attention to the  
greening of events, the meanings of sustainability and how to achieve it, the roles of events in  
sustainable development or sustainable cities, and new methods for social, cultural, and envi-  
ronmental impact assessment. Claims about the economic benefits of mega-events in particular  
are no longer accepted at face value, largely because of a history of unaccountability, corruption,  
violations of human rights, flawed methodologies, and a clear bias on the part of advocates  
towards development at any cost. A more critical examination of costs, ­ benefits, and their dis-  
tribution \(i.e., the equity issue\) is now an essential task for researchers and practitioners. 424

Professionalism is required in the practice of evaluation and impact assessment for events,  
event portfolios, and event populations. It is essential to build comprehensive evaluation into  
event organisations, and to work with stakeholders on external evaluation and impact assess-  
ment. Professionalism requires theory, skills, and a code of conduct that will augment those of  
existing event management and event tourism practitioners \(Table 17.4\).  
There have been specific and substantial contributions to our understanding of the social and  
cultural impacts of planned events, but it cannot be said that there is a comprehensive or sys-  
tematic approach. Anthropologists and sociologists have paid a lot of attention to festivals in  
particular, and to certain event-related issues, but they have had their own theoretical agendas.  
Their collective contributions do not constitute sufficient knowledge about the real or potential  
outcomes of all planned events as agents of change. 426

*Management, Planning, Design, and Operations*  
Getz \(2018, viii\) has argued that the application of mainstream management theory has been  
lagging. There has been a tendency to think of event management as the design and production of  
events, rather than viewing it as an application of management theory to a field of practice. With  
the pandemic came a realisation that the entire events sector, along with leisure, tourism, and  
hospitality, were vulnerable to major disruptions. Resilience, agile management, risk manage-  
ment, security, and health/safety have of necessity come to the fore. A real challenge is to balance  
competent management, including events as businesses, with design and creativity \(Table 17.5\).  
*Patterns and Processes*  
Patterns represent geographical or spatial dimensions, and processes encompass history and  
policy. The environment in which events and tourism exist is constantly changing. A major  
gap in theory development remains\: what are the dynamics of event populations and managed  
portfolios, and how can policy and strategy foster sustainability? So little historical and histo-  
riographical research has been undertaken on planned events that it is practically an untouched  
theme. How has the profession of event management evolved, from the earliest times? The  
Olympics have been over-analysed, but what about other forms of events that have a long lin-  
eage? Multi- and cross-cultural studies are essential.  
Geographical research on planned events has been given a solid foundation by Robert Jani-  
skee \(1980, 1985, 1991, 1994, 1996\) and a few others, but there has been no consistent 428

spatial-temporal approach. In cities, what has been the distribution and evolution of events, and  
how are they to be explained? Have resources, culture, or strategy been most responsible for the  
observable portfolios of events in any given area? When or how does an area or ­ community reach  
saturation level in terms of the numbers and types of events? How do events interact? What are  
their cumulative impacts? Some of the answers will assist in event-strategy formulation, policy-  
making, and marketing. They tie in with the concepts of place marketing and the eventful city,  
but with the proviso that overtourism is a serious issue in many places \(Table 17.6\).

# Future Perspectives  
Did the global pandemic change everything? Many people talk of a new normal as if we have  
put Covid and its variants behind us, and learned everything there is to be learned from the  
disaster. If there is a new normal, it is one in which we should all be alarmed by the pros-  
pect of ­ accelerating climate change, ongoing wars, mass migration, economic and supply chain  
problems, poverty, human rights violations, inflation, and recurring diseases. The new normal  
might be defined by the term permacrisis.  
Those involved in events understand that people and businesses need the experiences and  
positive outcomes, therefore event management will continue to be important – perhaps more  
so. Events meet fundamental human needs, so whatever the challenges and setbacks, the event  
sector will move forward and in many cases lead the way. That is especially important in terms  
of environmental sustainability, equality and human rights, and celebration of all things that  
bring people together peacefully and for the common good.  
The fourth edition of this book contained a number of propositions about the future of  
events, and this is a good time to re-visit them, and in some cases make changes. This is an  
­ exercise in scenario making, part of future studies. That means we could be wrong. Seraphin’s  
\(2021\) review confirmed those future propositions, but added two - related to future event  
­ professionals and their competence in dealing with crises. We agree that these are relevant.  
FP 1 \(Future proposition 1\)\: Planned, live events, both personal and societal in scale and meaning, will  
always be a prominent feature of civilisation, in all societies and cultures.  
Update\: Events bounced back as soon as pandemic restrictions were lifted \(in some  
areas prematurely\), showing the enduring importance of this sector of society and the econ-  
omy. Unfortunately, there are more parts of the world where war, repressive regions, pov-  
erty, disease, and natural disasters restrict or eliminate the planning of celebrations, sports,  
and business events. This very constraining trend shows no signs of relenting, and in many  
cases has been accompanied by protests, riots, and mass migration.  
FP 2\: Virtual events will gain in frequency and importance in response to advances in global technology,  
and because of globalisation forces and the costs or risks of travel, but they will be in addition to, and not  
a substitute for, live event experiences.  
Update\: Hybrid and virtual events are now likely to be a permanent feature, thereby  
requiring designers to enhance the experience and provide new value propositions.  
The metaverse is developing with AI and other new technologies that will make virtual  
and hybrid events more engaging and, perhaps, a preferred choice for some people for  
some purposes. Strong demand for live events, however, will not be diminished unless cir-  
cumstances actually impede travel at the local level – if that happens, we will all be going  
virtual.  
FP 3\: Corporate influence on the field of planned events will continue to increase, especially in terms of  
events produced as manifestations of marketing and branding.  
Update\: The nature of experiential marketing has shifted somewhat, with online or  
metaverse experiences gaining in popularity in the corporate world. Online influencers have  
become a force shaping demand, and online communities of interest are generating their  
own travel and event experiences, thereby potentially reducing the power of corporations  
and travel mediators such as destination marketers.  
FP 4\: The strategic justifications for public sector involvement with events, especially mega-events ­ bearing  
heavy costs, will be increasingly scrutinised and more difficult to defend, while social, cultural, and envi-  
ronmental justifications will become more acceptable. ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies Update\: Slow to change, the International Olympic Committee is finally showing signs  
of adopting sustainability principles as opposed to its long-standing habit of encouraging  
excessive competition and extravagant waste. Numerous cities do not want mega-events,  
and protests against bids are commonplace. Eventually, politicians, proponents, and govern-  
ing bodies will get the message – sustainability and mega-events are incompatible. Debate  
on the so-called legacy will shift from promises made \(often ignored, and sometimes noth-  
ing but bold lies\) to planning events as agents of change. In this regard, the emphasis must  
shift from one-time events to permanent event portfolios.  
FP 5\: Cities and destinations will become more aggressive and sophisticated in creating and managing  
portfolios of events for multiple purposes, and in facilitating synergies among events, venues, tourism,  
and other policy areas.  
Update\: It is not yet clear if the pandemic caused cities and destinations to rethink their  
event-related strategies. However, the argument that managed portfolios are more resilient  
has been strengthened by the pandemic, as many inherent weaknesses were revealed in the  
sector.  
FP 6\: The event professional of the future will be competent in event management theory and applications,  
knowledgeable about the importance of events in society, an effective advocate for event-related policy,  
and a constant learner within the field of Event Studies. Leaders of the future will be adaptable, creative,  
and devoted to excellence. They will be agile, able to deal effectively with crises, and will foster long-term  
resilience.  
Update\: These points remain valid. However, the pandemic did cause changes in the  
nature of work \(e.g., working from home, telecommuting and virtual conferencing, part-  
time versus full\) as well as perceptions of what kind of work and working conditions are  
desirable or acceptable. It remains to be seen how the event sector will adapt, and in par-  
ticular, whether professionals and volunteers will remain committed. Will student demand  
remain high? The well-being of volunteers and workers has become a priority. As AI makes  
many jobs redundant, event-related professions and jobs will remain vital to the economy  
and the well-being of society. For creators, dreamers, mentors, and experienc designers, the  
future is yours. Regarding competent business/organisational managers, you will always be  
needed.  
FP 7\: Even if travel and tourism collapse, possibly because of the cascading effects of global warming,  
another energy crisis, war, terrorism, or pandemics, events will still remain important globally because  
they meet fundamental human needs.  
Update\: We believe this proposition remains valid, however, the event sector will have  
to continue to adapt, taking a more community-based, bottom-up, and inclusive approach to  
development and management. If travel becomes impossible, a real prospect in some areas,  
virtuality will permit people to communicate, celebrate, stay informed, and be entertained.

STUDY GUIDE  
Before beginning research, it is important to consider a number of philosophical issues regard-  
ing the meaning and creation of knowledge, hence a discussion of epistemology, ontology,  
positivism, and alternative paradigms. Research in Event Studies should not be confined to any  
particular research paradigm or methodology, rather it should be inclusive and integrative. Pos-  
itivism, associated with quantitative, scientific methods \(including experimentation\) has led  
to substantial theory development in the foundation disciplines, much of which is necessary  
for Event Studies. Yet the experiential nature of events, and the diverse meanings attached to  
them, necessitate alternative approaches such as phenomenology, ethnography, and inductive, 432  
ResearCH and Knowledge Creation for Event Studies  
grounded research in general. An interpretivist perspective, recognising socially constructed  
realities, will definitely help progress the field. Research and evaluation purposes and methods  
were then discussed, revealing the broad range of approaches that can be useful. Throughout  
the book, examples of many methods have been provided, hopefully making it clear that no  
particular approach or technique should have pre-eminence.  
Give some thought to the future propositions, especially as the impacts of the pandemic con-  
tinue to play out. Where do professional event careers go from here? Are they still attractive  
and feasible? Think about your own career plans.  
STUDY QUESTIONS  
l Is Event Studies a ‘discipline’, ‘multidisciplinary’, or ‘interdisciplinary’? Why?  
l Explain the ways in which knowledge can be created for Event Studies.  
l Define these terms and explain how they affect the creation of knowledge\: ‘epistemology’;  
‘ontology’; ‘positivism’; ‘post-modernism’; and ‘critical theory’.  
l Why are ‘theories’ needed in Event Studies? How are they developed?  
l Show how ‘deductive’ and ‘inductive’ methodologies are both appropriate in Event Studies.  
l What are the main purposes and uses of research and evaluation?  
l Give examples of established research methods from foundation disciplines that can be  
applied in Event Studies.  
l Illustrate ‘quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ research that has been applied to the study of  
planned events.  
l Explain ‘phenomenology’ and why it is important in Event Studies.  
l Choose one of the suggested research questions and develop an idea \(or a full proposal\) for  
a research project.  
l Critically examine the future propositions and provide an alternative scenario.
