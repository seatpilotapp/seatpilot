Jim Kalbach Praise for Mapping Experiences  
# Second Edition  
Jim Kalbach demystifies the visual logic that underlies every possible “design thinking” or  
“UX workshopping” artifact with the intellectual enthusiasm of Edward Tufte. Kalbach gives  
meaning and studied attention to the ginormous service blueprint that covers an entire  
wall of your office all the way down to the humble sticky note that’s fallen to the floor.  
—John Maeda  
Technologist and author of How To Speak Machine  
This is the book I wish I’d had years ago. I’ve made hundreds of alignment diagrams and  
maps while working with clients and startups, and it can feel mucky and murky. Jim  
crystallizes the benefits, clarifies the processes, and provides inspiring visual examples  
that will motivate design and business leaders to better serve their customers.

How do you know that something \(music, movie, book\) is really great? Each time you  
listen to it, watch it, or read it, you find something new\: new thought, new insight,  
new perspective. It just keeps ringing the bell again and again, and again. This book is  
exactly like this. It is the most comprehensive guide about creating value through maps  
and diagrams I know and recommend to my colleagues, our students, and partners.  
—Yuri Vedenin  
Founder, UXPressiaMapping Experiences is the essential guide to using human-centered mapping methods  
to align stakeholders across silos in any organization. Kalbach expertly provides both  
a framing philosophy and practical instruction, with a healthy thread of hard-won,  
practical advice, in an immediately accessible and actionable package. It is a necessary  
reference for any individual or team creating products and services in the 21st century.  
—Andrew Hinton  
Author of Understanding Context  
In this second edition, Jim expands on the topic of mapping that he had  
already crushed in the first edition. Jim’s insights bring clarity to what, previous  
to this book, had been a confusing jumble of boxes and arrows.

It’s easy to approach projects from the inside out. By mapping out an experience, you uncover  
details about the people using your products and services that can change your viewpoint  
to look outside-in, and ultimately result in more thoughtful and impactful solutions.

Design lead, Open Systems Technology  
We can’t make a UX until we know the story that brings the user and  
experience together. Mapping Experiences helps people choose the right  
maps, processes, and structures to do the essential work of storytelling.  
—Torrey Podmajersky  
Author of Strategic Writing for UXThis book is a treasure trove of diagrams. If you are searching to find one suitable for your  
specific needs, reading this book is the right first step. This book teaches you to focus on  
the basic concepts of alignment so that you don’t get trapped in the labyrinth of jargons.

# First Edition  
Mapping Experiences will help both designers and consumers of design services  
understand how to visualize experiences and the system ecology in which products  
and services exist with the all-important customer. His approach to the subject is both  
broad and deep. The analytical and practical/practice chapters speak directly to the  
current interest in visual artifacts associated with strategy and service design.  
—Paul Kahn  
Experience Design Director, Mad\*Pow  
Author of Mapping Websites  
As designers grapple with ever more complex services and systems, the need to  
visually map them is paramount. There are hundreds of different ways of mapping and  
diagramming experiences and they are locked away in hundreds of different books  
and academic papers. Jim Kalbach has pulled them all together in an excellent book  
that should be on the desk of everyone involved in UX, service design and business.  
—Andy Polaine  
Design Director, FjordAdopting an outside-in perspective, developing empathy with the people you support,  
and creating visualizations of these perspectives is the power-trio for the future of your  
organization. The trio allows you to support people, internally and externally, in a more  
nuanced, coordinated manner. It also enables you to see new paths ahead, so that  
you can branch away from your competition. Jim’s book is an excellent explanation  
of this trio, and includes a collection of tools that you can put to immediate use.

With Mapping Experiences, Jim Kalbach has done a terrific service for anyone  
tackling complex, systemic design challenges. He not only documents the best  
approaches to experience mapping, but also pushes the topic forward, by sharing  
his insights and hard-won experience about this rich, still-evolving area of design  
practice. Mapping Experiences will be an essential guide for many years to come.  
—Andrew Hinton  
Author of Understanding Context  
We live in an age where images are more powerful than words. Everyone working  
in the areas of customer experience and strategy will benefit from learning how  
to express ideas visually, and Mapping Experiences is a great place to start.  
—Victor Lombardi  
Author of Why We Fail\: Learning from Experience Design FailuresThis book offers the right approach to using maps as a tool in experience design and  
execution, and that is, there is no one-size-fits-all. Instead of offering just one idea around  
how to best align your teams around the idea of better experiences, Kalbach offers several  
tips, tricks, and processes to actually get things done. This is the down-to-earth manual that’s  
been missing. Readers will find the right way for their unique challenges, not one unique  
process to try to make fit for their situation. Everyone can benefit from reading this book!

Our experiences interacting with faceless companies often make us ill. Mapping  
Experiences, wielded properly, might actually do something to eliminate the all-  
too-typical shoulder shrugging and buck passing we face—and help designers  
and decision makers alike become customer experience heroes.

xii Contents Second Edition Preface  
My journey with mapping experiences began around 2005,  
while I was working for LexisNexis. At the time, we were  
intent on understanding the workflows of legal professionals.  
There was only scattered literature on the topic of mapping  
back then, and I was forced to navigate different approaches  
myself. In many ways, the first edition of Mapping Experienc-  
es is the sum of my mistakes and observations along the way.  
Mapping has become mainstream over the past decade or so.  
Stakeholders are now asking for “customer journey maps”  
by name, even if they don’t know exactly what they are  
requesting. Mapping experiences and associated fields, such  
as experience design, service design, and customer experience  
management, are maturing quickly to keep up with demand.  
As I continue to watch the field, I’ve noticed five trends since  
Mapping Experiences was published in 2016.  
PREFACE  
First of all, mapping is moving from an activity focused on a  
deliverable to one of actionability. It’s not about the map \(the  
noun\), but about the mapping \(a verb\). The mapmaker nec-  
essarily becomes a facilitator , and the map becomes a spring-  
board into collective sense making around human experience.  
Chapters 8–9 have been rewritten to better reflect this trend,  
and many of the case studies included in this edition highlight  
how to make mapping more actionable.  
A second trend is an increased focus on multichannel experi-  
ence design and ecosystem mapping. Although I touched on  
those topics in the first edition, the demand has risen greatly.  
I’ve reframed an entire chapter \(Chapter 14\) to provide more  
detail on multiple alignments.  
Third, I’ve also been seeing mapping applied to noncommer-  
cial settings. The notion of diagramming experiences has been  
used in social arenas, government, and beyond. For instance,  
at the end of Chapter 1, I summarize my involvement in map-  
ping the experiences of former violent extremists. But I’ve also  
xvseen mapping being used in fighting homelessness, helping  
tornado victims, and even fighting domestic violence. In the  
end, mapping experiences isn’t just for software design or  
commercial applications; it’s about understanding the human  
condition.  
Fourth, we’re seeing the expansion of mapping as a manage-  
ment activity. Customer experience \(CX\) measurement has  
matured quite a bit, with a range of tools on the market. I  
discuss this progress in Chapter 3 at a high level. The type of  
mapping I advocate in Mapping Experiences is a generative  
one, starting with team alignment and creative exploration of  
possibilities. Managing CX contrasts with this by focusing on  
the quantification and tracking of the experience over time.  
Finally, there has been a dramatic increase in focus on the  
employee experience \(EX\) as a driver for great customer  
experiences. Since mapping plays a role in EX, I’ve included  
a completely new chapter on the topic. It’s a rich field with  
a growing body of literature and research—enough to fill an  
entire book. Accordingly, my focus is limited to some of the  
core concepts of mapping the EX\: in particular, aligning the  
EX and CX.  
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has changed  
the way we work in general, and along with this has changed  
the nature of experience mapping. First, mapping research  
and workshops need to happen remotely. As a longtime  
advocate of remote collaboration, I had already included some  
perspectives on remote work throughout the book in the first  
edition. In a post-pandemic world, mapping online and facil-  
xvi Preface  
itating remote sessions will be part of the new normal; the  
way we collaborate at work will be changed forever.  
Perhaps more importantly, the pandemic has forced busi-  
nesses to be more resilient in many ways—from managing  
employees to finding new avenues to success. Here again,  
mapping can help teams reprioritize existing customer  
journeys and create entirely new experiences. For instance, a  
supermarket could leverage mapping to plan and accelerate  
a new online pickup journey, or a large corporation could  
map new office space and employee interactions for a safer  
employee experience.  
This second edition of Mapping Experiences has been signifi-  
cantly updated to include current information reflecting these  
trends, as well as new examples and extended references.  
# First Edition Preface  
“Then the Ping-Pong match begins.”  
That’s what a customer told me about his experience with the  
billing process of the company I was consulting. After digging  
deeper and having conversations with other customers, it  
became clear to me what he meant.  
Apparently, the company was known for sending incorrect  
invoices. Finding a resolution often proved difficult for  
customers. They instinctively called the support hotline first,  
but agents there weren’t empowered to fix problems with  
invoices. Customers then called their sales representative,  
who wasn’t responsible for billing issues. Relatively quickly, customers fell into an aggravating communication loop with  
the company.  
But it got worse.  
The collections department didn’t suspend its scheduled  
warning notices. And they didn’t know if a customer may  
have questioned an incorrect bill. So amidst customers’  
frustration troubleshooting an incorrect bill, they received a  
past-due notice.  
That not only added insult to injury, it also made the reso-  
lution exponentially more complicated\: three or four parties  
were now involved, and the customer was caught in the  
middle. Ping-Pong, indeed.  
This was not rare. I easily uncovered similar stories with just a  
handful of additional customer interviews. One person I spoke  
with recalled how absolutely livid she was when this hap-  
pened. She was ready to cancel a service vital to her business  
just out of principle.  
As a designer, I find it disheartening to hear such stories. But  
it’s not surprising. I’ve seen it over and over again\: in large  
organizations, one hand does not know what the other is  
doing.  
My research was part of a larger experience mapping project  
I was conducting. The effort resulted in several diagrams to  
illustrate customers’ current condition\: a map of the end-to-  
end journey and a series of workflow diagrams illustrating  
their experiences step-by-step.  
To conclude the project, I held a workshop with various  
stakeholders from a variety of functions\: sales representatives,  
marketing specialists, business managers, designers, and  
developers. Walking through the illustrations allowed us to  
comprehend the customer experience in detail.  
I intentionally put myself in the breakout group examining the  
billing workflow—just to see what would happen. Everything  
went fine until we got to the point where an incorrect bill and  
past-due warnings were sent out. Then came the collective  
outrage\: “How is this possible?” they asked. They were un-  
aware their company was capable of inflicting so much pain  
on customers.  
A clear action item emerged\: implement the ability to place  
a hold on bills that customers have challenged. This would  
prevent collection notices from being sent out until the issue  
was resolved. The head of customer care had a draft propos-  
al for this procedure by the end of the day. Initially, this was  
to be done manually, but eventually an automated hold was  
needed.  
Of course the real problem was sending incorrect invoices  
in the first place. But even if that were corrected, a larger,  
more fundamental issue emerged in our team discussion\: the  
organization wasn’t able to handle customer complaints and  
requests across departments.  
From this particular incident, the sales manager was eas-  
ily able to recount additional stories of troubleshooting  
non-sales-related issues with customers. This distracted him  
from his sales duties. And the customer care representative  
Preface xviidescribed how their team often couldn’t help customers on  
the phone immediately, yet would have to take the brunt of  
their anger.  
By coming together and having a conversation around the  
actual experience, we were able to reflect on the company’s  
performance as a service provider across functions, beyond  
this one particular incident. It became obvious\: the organi-  
zation faced larger, systemic issues. These only came to light  
after we focused on the experience from the customer’s point  
of view.  
# Aligning for Value  
Few organizations deliberately want to create bad experi-  
ences for the people they serve. Yet experiences like the one  
described previously happen all the time.  
I believe the fundamental problem is one of alignment\: or-  
ganizations are out of sync with what the people they serve  
actually experience.  
Misalignment impacts the entire enterprise\: teams lack a  
common purpose, solutions are built that are detached from  
reality, there is a focus on technology rather than experience,  
and strategy is shortsighted.  
Aligned organizations have a shared mental model of what  
they are trying to accomplish. They are obsessed with deliver-  
ing amazing experiences for the people they serve.  
xviii Preface  
More and more, people select goods and services based on  
the total experience they have. To meet market expectations,  
it’s imperative to align around the end-to-end experience.  
To achieve alignment, I see three imperatives organizations  
must follow\:  
1\. View your offerings from outside-in rather than  
inside-out.  
From my work with dozens of companies, I have seen  
teams with the best intentions focused too much on  
internal processes. They are wrapped up in a type of  
organizational navel gazing. Many simply don’t know  
what customers actually go through.  
What’s needed is a change in viewpoint—from inside-out  
to outside-in. Organizations must have a clear under-  
standing of the experiences they create. This is not limited  
to just frontline personnel. Everyone must empathize with  
the individuals they serve.  
In this sense, gaining empathy isn’t only about feeling the  
same emotions as another person. Instead, it refers to the  
ability to grasp what others are experiencing—the ability  
to put yourself in their shoes. Empathy for others comes  
with the recognition that their perspective is valid even  
if it’s different from your own. A little empathy is not  
enough\: teams must deeply care about their customers  
and what they experience. More than that, members of an organization need to  
internalize people’s desires and motivations, and advocate  
on behalf of the people they service in everything they  
do. They need to be able to turn empathy into compas-  
sion by taking action toward creating a better overall  
experience.  
2\. Align internal functions across teams and levels.  
Organizational silos prevent alignment. Aligned organi-  
zations instead work across functional boundaries. They  
have a relentless focus on doing whatever it takes to  
ensure their constituents have great experiences.  
Alignment is not just about superficial improvements. It’s  
about the collective actions of the entire group, at all lev-  
els. An organization’s backstage processes have as much  
to do with the overall experience as the visible points of  
interaction that individuals encounter.  
On his TV show, top chef Gordon Ramsay saves failing  
restaurants by realigning the whole establishment. He  
usually starts by fixing the kitchen. He’ll chastise cooks for  
improper food storage or for having a dirty exhaust hood  
above the stove. The actions in the kitchen influence the  
experience diners have.  
Aligned organizations have their kitchens in order. They  
move together in the same direction, for the same  
cause—to create brilliant experiences. And they don’t  
focus on parts of the experience. They consider the end-  
to-end interaction. The sum of local optimizations does  
not guarantee optimization at the global level.  
Note that “alignment” is already an inherent part of the  
business strategy vernacular. Typically, managers speak of  
upward alignment—getting everyone in the organization  
to work toward a stated strategy from above. My inter-  
pretation of the term focuses on value alignment\: looking  
first at the value an organization needs to create from the  
individual’s perspective, and then figuring out the strat-  
egy and technology needed to deliver that value.  
3\. Create visualizations as shared references.  
The challenge of alignment lies in the difficulty of seeing  
interdependencies across the organization. Each depart-  
ment may be functioning fine on its own. But from the  
users’ perspective, the experience is a patchwork of inter-  
actions they have to navigate themselves.  
Visualizations are a key device to break down siloed  
thinking. A diagram of the individual’s experience serves  
as a tangible model for the teams to rally around. More  
importantly, visualizations allow the viewer to grasp inter-  
locking relationships at once.  
In the story opening this preface, sales managers and cus-  
tomer care agents had separately shared their obstacles  
and inefficiencies with their managers. But it was not  
until decision makers could see connected factors that  
both the problem and the solution became apparent.  
Reports and slide decks full of text and numbers tend not  
to have this causal effect. Visualizations do.  
Preface xixBut visualizations don’t provide answers outright—they  
foster conversations. Diagrams are compelling artifacts  
that draw interest and attention from others in the orga-  
nization. They are a means to engage others in discourse.  
Visualizations point to opportunities and serve as spring-  
boards into innovation.  
In a broader sense, visualizations inform strategy. They are  
a key way of seeing the market from the customer’s per-  
spective. Mapping experiences isn’t a nice-to-have design  
tool; it’s a must-have for strategic alignment.  
Finally, as practices like lean product development take  
hold in organizations, the need for alignment only  
increases. Small, empowered teams need to be on the  
same page as the rest of the organization. A compelling  
visualization gets everyone moving in the same direction  
for the same reasons. Your organization’s agility depends  
on shared purpose.  
# This book is about possibilities.

# your thinking and approach  
# toward mapping in general.  
xx Preface  
# Scope of This Book  
This book is about a type of tool that provides organizations  
insight into their broader product and service ecosystems. I  
call these tools alignment diagrams—an umbrella term for any  
map that seeks to align how individuals in a system engage  
with that system and its provider. Note that there is no one  
method or approach for creating alignment diagrams. Instead,  
you’ll find a range of options depending on the problem  
you’re solving. Chapter 1 explains this concept in more detail.  
This book deals with various techniques for mapping experienc-  
es, not a single method or output. The focus is on the category  
of diagrams that collectively seek to describe the human experi-  
ence. Many related techniques are included here as well.  
These diagrams have already been an implicit part of the de-  
sign and creative disciplines for decades. In fact, you may have  
already used alignment diagrams as part of your work.  
Reframing these approaches as tools for organizational align-  
ment emphasizes their strategic relevance. They help flip an  
organization’s perspective from inside-out to outside-in. In  
doing so, they help build empathy and provide a model for  
decision making that is inclusive of the human condition.  
Alignment diagrams also offer a common vision throughout  
an organization. They aid in creating consistency in thought  
and action across departmental lines. This type of internal  
coherency determines success. To be clear\: alignment diagrams are no silver bullet and only  
part of organizational alignment. However, I believe the story  
they tell goes a long way in achieving alignment, particularly  
in larger organizations.  
The concept of mapping helps us understand complex  
systems of interaction, particularly when we’re dealing with  
abstract concepts like experience. But mapping experiences is  
not a singular activity limited to one type of diagram over an-  
other. There are many possible perspectives and approaches.  
In this sense, this book is about possibilities. My hope is that  
the book expands your thinking and approach toward map-  
ping in general.  
There are many types of diagrams covered here, each with  
different names and backgrounds. Don’t get hung up on  
labels. Many of the distinctions are historical and based on  
which term was coined first. Instead, focus on value align-  
ment, not one specific technique over the other. It’s entirely  
possible to create a new type of diagram that continues to  
evolve the practice. I encourage you to do so.  
# What This Book Is Not About  
This book is not about customer experience management,  
service design, or user experience design. It is about dia-  
grams—conceptual models that span those fields of practice.  
The approach I describe here is not a design process but rath-  
er a process for mapping independent of specific discipline.  
This is also not a comprehensive book about formal tech-  
niques in graphic design, information design, or illustration.  
There are volumes of resources about graphic design and  
illustration that go into much more detail than I can here.  
Finally, I realize that there is a technical difference between  
the words map \(an illustration of where things are\) and  
diagram \(an illustration of how things work\). However, this  
book does not distinguish between the two. In practice, terms  
like customer journey map and experience map are, in fact,  
misnomers. But they are so widely used that the distinction  
between map and diagram becomes irrelevant.  
# Audience for This Book  
This book is intended for anyone involved in the end-to-end  
planning, design, and development of products and services.  
It’s for people who need a holistic view of the ecosystem in  
which their offerings are situated. This includes designers,  
product managers, brand managers, marketing specialists,  
strategists, entrepreneurs, and business owners.  
Regardless of your skill level in mapping, there is something  
for you in this book. The steps and processes outlined here  
are basic enough for beginners to start creating diagrams. The  
related techniques should provide new insights for experts as  
well.  
# A Note on the Diagrams  
I’ve taken painstaking care to provide a range of diagrams in  
this book that reflect different approaches to mapping expe-  
riences. My interest is in providing complete, whole examples  
so you can view them in their entirety. Although I’ve given the  
Preface xxiutmost attention to the display and clarity of each diagram, in  
some cases, not all texts are legible. Please see the references  
in the image credits and throughout the book to locate the  
originals online, where available. I also encourage you to find  
and collect your own examples for inspiration and guidance.  
# Book Outline  
The second edition of Mapping Experiences is divided into  
three parts.  
# Part 1\: Visualizing Value  
Part 1 provides an overview and background on the concept  
of alignment diagrams\:  
•  
Chapter 1 introduces the term alignment diagram as a  
class of document that seeks to visually align an individual’s  
experience with the services of an organization. It focuses  
on the concepts of value alignment and value-centered  
design.  
•  
Chapter 2 looks at the key elements of mapping experi-  
ences, breaking them down into individual components.  
•  
Chapter 3 introduces the broader topic of experi-  
ence design with a particular focus on the employee  
experience.  
•  
Chapter 4 deals broadly with the topic of strategy in gen-  
eral and the role of visualization in strategy creation.  
xxii Preface  
# Part 2\: A General Process for Mapping  
Part 2 details a general process for creating alignment dia-  
grams, broken into four phases\: initiate, investigate, illustrate,  
and align. After understanding and empathizing with the cur-  
rent experience, we envision what future experiences can be\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Chapter 5 details how to initiate a mapping project,  
including the key considerations in effectively framing the  
effort.  
Chapter 6 outlines how to investigate and perform  
research before creating a diagram.  
Chapter 7 provides an overview of how to illustrate a  
diagram.  
Chapter 8 deals with how to use diagrams to align teams  
in a workshop to explore and understand the problem to  
be solved before developing a solution.  
•  
Chapter 9 presents a range of complementary techniques  
used in conjunction with alignment diagrams to envision  
future experiences and make mapping actionable through  
experimentation and eventually design and development. Part 3\: Types of Diagrams in Detail  
The final part of the book looks at some specific types of dia-  
grams in detail, including a brief historical overview of each\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Chapter 10 introduces service blueprints, the oldest type  
of diagram covered here.  
Chapter 11 focuses on customer journey maps, includ-  
ing investigations into decision making and conversion  
funnels.  
Chapter 12 deals with experience maps, including a dis-  
cussion of job maps and workflow diagrams.  
Chapter 13 looks at mental model diagrams, as pioneered  
by Indi Young. There are also discussions of grounded  
theory, information architecture, and related diagrams.  
Chapter 14 discusses ecosystem maps, or diagrams that  
seek to visualize a broad system of entities and interac-  
tions between them.

Preface xxvThe above diagram is a blank model for a multichannel experience map created by Chris Risdon and the folks at Adaptive Path, leaders in experience  
mapping techniques \(taken with permission from “Anatomy of an Experience Map”\).  
In this book, we’ll look at how to complete this and other illustrations to help you shift team alignment from an inside-in to an outside-in perspective. I’ve seen it over and over again\: organizations get wrapped up in  
their own processes and forget to look at the markets they serve.  
Operational efficiency is prioritized over customer satisfaction.  
Many simply don’t know what their customers go through.  
But we’re witnessing a shift of Copernican proportions.\*  
Nowadays, customers don’t revolve around the business;  
rather, businesses must figure out how they fit into the lives  
of their customers. This requires a change in mindset—one  
that this book can help you achieve.  
Part 1 covers some of the fundamental aspects of the map-  
ping process.  
Alignment diagrams, introduced in Chapter 1, are a category of  
diagram that reorients organizations. They help you move from  
an inside-out view of the market to an outside-in perspective.  
\*  
See, for example, Steve Denning, “Why Building a Better Mousetrap Doesn’t  
Work Anymore,” Forbes \(Feb 2014\).  
# PART 1  
# Visualizing Value  
Chapter 2 deals with the overall approach to mapping experi-  
ences. Although the concept of “experience” is slippery, there  
is a systematic way to capture an experience in a diagram.  
The best way to create a great customer experience is to focus  
intently on fostering an exceptional employee experience. This  
is the topic of Chapter 3, which shows how you can use map-  
ping techniques to improve and innovate; to go beyond mere  
satisfaction and create a sense of purpose among employees.  
Chapter 4 looks at how diagrams point to new opportunities  
that inform strategy . They represent a new way of seeing the  
market, your organization, and your market position. “You’ve got to start with the  
# customer experience and work back  
# toward the technology.”

# Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In  
People expect some benefit when they use the products and  
services an organization provides. They want to get a job  
done, solve a problem, or experience an emotion. If they then  
perceive this benefit as valuable, they’ll give something in  
return—money, time, or attention.  
To be successful, organizations need to capture some worth  
from their offerings. They need to earn profit, maximize reach,  
or improve their image. Value creation is bidirectional.  
But how do we locate the source of value in such a relation-  
ship? Simply put, value creation lies at the intersection of  
human interaction with the provider  
of a service. It’s where the experiences  
of individuals in a given market  
intersect with the  
Individuals  
offerings of an organi-  
zation \(Figure 1-1\).

Organization  
A number of years ago, I was struggling to determine what  
type of diagram to use on a project\: a customer journey map,  
mental model diagram, service blueprint, or something else.  
After some comparison of several examples, a similar set of  
principles became apparent\: these diagrams all illustrate the  
value creation equation in different ways.  
Viewing the commonalities of various diagrams opened up  
possibilities. I wasn’t locked into one method over another. I  
realized the focus should not be on a specific technique but  
rather on the broader concept of alignment.  
More importantly, I was better able to connect the dots  
between human-centered design and business objectives.  
Concentrating on alignment allowed me to talk with business  
leaders and stakeholders about how mapping experiences  
could help them reach their goals. Within a short time, I was  
running workshops with senior leaders and showing my dia-  
grams to CEOs.  
Creating solutions by focusing on the interaction between  
individuals and organizations represents a perspective referred  
to as value-centered design. In his article “Searching for the  
3Center of Design,” service design expert Jess McMullin de-  
fines value-centered design as follows\:  
Value-centered design starts a story about an ideal  
interaction between an individual and an organization  
and the benefits each realizes from that interaction.  
In this chapter, I introduce the concept of alignment diagrams  
to describe a class of diagrams that visualize the story of inter-  
action between individuals and an organization. By the end  
you should have a firm grasp of how to model value align-  
ment, some of the core commonalities underlying different  
diagram types, and the benefits of value alignment.  
# Modeling Experiences  
In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO. In a town hall meet-  
ing, he responded to a question about the company’s technology  
from an Apple employee by saying, “You’ve got to start with the  
customer experience and work back toward the technology.”\*  
With this he gave insight into how he was going to turn Apple  
around\: by reversing the standard equation for providing  
software. Instead of inventing a technology and then market-  
ing it to customers, he wanted to begin by imagining an ideal  
experience and then fitting the technology to that experience.  
The strategy worked, for Apple at least. Other companies  
were slow to adopt this mindset, and yet others are still

working toward that position. Although simple in principle,  
traditional organizations struggle to adopt a new view of  
creating value.  
Part of the struggle is that the concept of “experience” defies  
precise definition. Organizations aren’t set up to manage such  
fuzzy concepts. How, then, should a team start with an expe-  
rience and work back toward the technology?  
A key way to understand “experience” is to create a model  
that visually represents the experience. Models are already a  
common part of innovation and design. For example, a perso-  
na represents people in a given market and a business model  
represents how an organization can be profitable.  
Hugh Dubberly, renowned designer and business consultant,  
believes models are an antidote to complexity in modern busi-  
ness operations. By illustrating all the moving parts at once,  
they can help organizations better understand their playing  
field and their markets. He explains\:  
\[In the internet age,\] there is a virtually infinite number  
of combinations, and no one customer ever does quite  
the same thing as another. And these things are never  
finished; they just keep growing and changing and be-  
ing constantly updated on the fly. A model is what you  
get when you put it all into one view to understand  
what’s going on. It can be a great tool for managing  
the teams of people necessary.†  
† From an interview with Hugh Dubberly conducted by David Brown. See David  
Brown, “Supermodeler\: Hugh Dubberly,” GAIN\: AIGA Journal of Design for the  
Network Economy \(May 2000\). It stands to reason, then, that a model of an experience can  
align the perspectives of the people who have to enable that  
experience. This is the role of mapping experiences\: a form of  
visual storytelling that allows teams to find solutions together.  
Overall, diagramming coordinates insights from the outside  
world with the teams inside an organization who create  
products and services to meet market needs. In other words,  
a model can serve as a hinge upon which we can pivot from  
the problem space into the solution space.  
# Alignment Diagrams  
I use the term alignment diagram to refer to any map, dia-  
gram, or visualization that reveals both sides of value creation  
in a single overview. It is a category of models that illustrate  
the interaction between people and organizations, making an  
otherwise invisible, abstract circumstance—a human experi-  
ence—tangible and actionable.  
# Individuals  
# Interactions  
# Organization  
FIGURE 1-2. Alignment diagrams have two parts\: a description of an  
experience and a description of an organization’s offerings, with the  
interaction between the two.  
Logically, alignment diagrams have two parts \(Figure 1-2\).  
On the one side, they illustrate aspects of the individual’s  
experience—a depiction of aggregate behavior across ar-  
chetypal users. On the other, alignment diagrams reflect an  
­ organization’s offerings and processes. The points of interac-  
tion between the two are the means of value exchange.  
Such diagrams are not new and are already used in practice.  
Thus, my definition of alignment diagrams is less of a prop-  
osition for a specific technique than a recognition of how  
existing approaches can be seen in a new, constructive way.  
You may have already used some of the following common  
examples\:  
•  
Customer journey maps  
•  
Service blueprints  
•  
Experience maps  
•  
Mental model diagrams  
Take, for instance, customer journey maps \(CJMs\). They  
illustrate the experiences of an individual as a customer of an  
organization. CJMs typically include three key phases\: be-  
coming aware of an offering, deciding to acquire it, and then  
either staying loyal or discontinuing use.  
Figure 1-3 shows a simple CJM of a search service for finding  
architects internationally. This is a modified version of a dia-  
gram I created for a project a number of years ago, concealing  
the name of the product and company. The intent was to map  
the current state experience customers had with the service.  
Alignment Diagrams 5Individuals  
Interactions  
Organization  
FIGURE 1-3. A simple customer journey map aligns the individual’s experience with enabling activities across an organization.  
6 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In Phases of interaction are listed across the top, starting with  
“Become Aware” and going on to “Renew/Upgrade.” The  
rows show various facets of the customer experience\: actions,  
feelings, desired outcomes, and pain points.  
The bottom half shows key departmental activities to support  
or respond to the customer. An analysis of strengths, weak-  
nesses, opportunities, and threats appears below that. The  
primary means of interaction are listed in the middle row.  
Overall, moving from left to right through the chronology  
shows alignment between the customer’s experience and the  
processes that intersect with  
that customer experience.  
The team I was working with  
at the time used the diagram  
to identify opportunities for  
innovation and improvement  
in the journey. We were able to troubleshoot some major  
barriers to consumption that were previously unknown.  
Service blueprints are another type of diagram showing the  
chronology of a service interaction. Figure 1-4 shows an  
example of what is called an “expressive service blueprint,”  
created by Susan Spraragen and Carrie Chan. This diagram  
illustrates the interactions a patient has when going to an  
ophthalmologist.  
The intent was to explicitly show the human emotions of a  
service encounter. In this example the patient is left confused  
about their prescription, an effect caused by two emotive  
states\: distraction and anxiety.  
# The focus should not be on a  
# specific technique but rather on the  
# broader concept of alignment.  
Again, we see the two halves of the equation\: the individual’s  
frontstage experience \(in pink and purple\) and the backstage  
processes of the organization \(in green and blue\). The dia-  
gram serves as a diagnostic tool to pinpoint service inefficien-  
cies and sources of improvement for the customer.  
Experience maps are a relatively new type of alignment  
diagram compared to CJMs and service blueprints. Figure 1-5  
shows an example of an experience map created by Chris Ris-  
don, author and thought leader in experience mapping. These  
maps illustrate experiences people have within a given topic,  
in this case touring through  
Europe by train.  
In the top portion, the map  
shows the experience people  
have when traveling. At the  
bottom are opportunities  
for the service provider. The interactions between the two are  
embedded in the middle of the diagram. Teams can use this  
view to understand how a range of services might fit into an  
individual’s broader objective. In this case, Rail Europe’s offer-  
ings are mapped back to the traveler’s experience.  
Other kinds of diagrams can also be considered types of  
alignment diagrams. For instance, a mental model diagram  
is a broad exploration of human behaviors, feelings, and  
motivations. The approach was pioneered by Indi Young and  
detailed in her book Mental Models. These are typically very  
large diagrams that, when printed, can cover an entire wall.

FIGURE 1-6. Mental model diagrams seek to hierarchically align customer behavior with business support, shown in two halves.  
10 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In The example in Figure 1-6 shows a close-up of a mental mod-  
el diagram for going to the movies.  
A horizontal line in the middle divides the diagram into two  
parts. The top shows the individual’s tasks, feelings, and  
philosophies. These are grouped by topic into what are called  
“towers,” which are then sectioned off into goal spaces \(e.g.,  
“Choose Film” and “Learn More about a Film”\). The boxes  
below the center line show support for achieving those goals  
from various products or services.  
Alignment diagrams communicate an aggregate story of typical  
behavior and emotions across a similar group of people. The  
way that story is told differs from diagram to diagram. A cus-  
tomer journey map is useful  
for improving the customer  
experience by showing a  
breadth of touchpoints across  
time; a service blueprint  
details the steps in a service  
episode and is well suited to optimizing the service provision  
process; an experience map shows a broader context to help  
identify how offerings integrate; and a mental model diagram  
reveals unmet needs that can serve as the impetus for com-  
pletely new solutions.  
Note that in general, terminology around different types of  
alignment diagrams is inconsistent\: what one person might  
# A key way to understand “experience”  
# is to create a model that visually  
# represents the experience.  
call a customer journey map, another calls an experience map  
or service blueprint. The lines between these examples are  
often blurred. Don’t be overly concerned with the labels. In-  
stead, focus on the desired outcome of your mapping effort\:  
alignment.  
The notion of alignment diagrams finds common ground in  
these examples. As the fields of customer experience, user  
experience, and service design evolve and overlap, it becomes  
increasingly important to have a range of approaches to solve  
unique problems in order to adapt to new challenges.  
In the end, alignment diagrams represent a range of tech-  
niques for mapping experiences. When alignment diagrams  
are crafted from an out-  
side-in perspective, they  
build empathy and align  
decision making. Like eth-  
nographers, we observe the  
outside world and encode  
it. But unlike ethnographers, the result we produce isn’t a  
lengthy written work but instead a relatively compact visual-  
ization that serves as a springboard into action.  
It’s up to you to select the approach most appropriate for  
your situation. This book is designed to help you do just that,  
and in the following chapters I’ll help you navigate how to  
best map the experiences most relevant to you.  
Alignment Diagrams 11Multiple Alignment  
Mapping tends to focus on a single actor and single expe-  
rience. However, modern business complexity motivates  
us to be more inclusive in the scope of mapping efforts.  
Multiple alignment \(i.e., alignment across multiple actors  
and/or multiple touchpoints\) is possible, but techniques are  
still ­ developing.  
One way that I’ve found to map the experience of multiple  
actors is to create a series of related but separate diagrams for  
each target segment. For instance, eBay targets two distinct  
user groups\: buyers and sellers. It’s possible to illustrate sepa-  
rate interactions as two interlocking experiences, as reflected  
in Figure 1-7. A visual comparison between the two experi-  
ences is possible by looking at the top and bottom of a single

Feelings  
Decide to sell List item Take order Ship product  
Search for item Place order Wait for shipment Use product  
column spanning the diagrams \(e.g., compare “Take order” to  
“Place order” in Figure 1-7\).  
It’s also possible to show the interaction between three or  
more actors in a single diagram, placing a focus on the overall  
process rather than a given individual’s experience. Andy  
Polaine, a leading service design expert, has expanded on  
service blueprints by mapping multiple actors simultaneously.  
His approach is straightforward\: add a row in the diagram for  
each new role involved in a service ecosystem, as shown in  
Figure 1-8.  
Another issue with multiple alignment is how to show the  
interaction across multiple touchpoints. Gianluca Brugnoli, for  
one, suggests creating a touchpoint  
matrix, as shown in Figure 1-9, in  
his article “Connecting the Dots of  
User Experience.” He overlays a sin-  
gle actor’s interactions on possible  
touchpoints in a chronology that  
doesn’t move from left to right, but  
rather in a circular motion through  
the touchpoints. By showing a  
sequence and the locations of inter-  
actions, Brugnoli provides context  
for touchpoints in a journey.  
FIGURE 1-7. To align the experience of multiple actors, create separate but related diagrams that can be  
displayed together.  
12 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In FIGURE 1-8. This expanded service blueprint by Andy Polaine includes multiple actors, each on a separate row.  
Multiple Alignment 13FIGURE 1-9. This multichannel experience diagram for photography created by Gianluca Brugnoli shows a sequence of interactions.  
14 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In Brugnoli believes that the system is the experience. It’s the  
sum of all touchpoints, as well as the connections between  
them. He writes\:  
The challenge that logically follows is to design con-  
nections. In the system scenario, design should be  
mainly focused on finding the right connections within  
the network and its parts, rather than in creating  
closed and self-sufficient systems, tools and services.  
Consider also the cross-channel blueprint \(Figure 1-10\) created  
by Tyler Tate, an entrepreneur and expert in search system de-  
sign. While it doesn’t include the visual richness of other types  
of alignment diagrams, it does align user behavior \(along the  
top of the chart\) with channels \(vertically on the left\) and sup-  
port from the organization \(the bottom row\). In this simple  
yet insightful example, a product taxonomy spans all channels,  
highlighting the need for cross-departmental collaboration.  
Regardless of the approach, the same core principles of  
alignment still apply. The aim is to visually coordinate internal  
and external factors of the context you’re operating in. The  
result will help align the perspectives of the teams that have  
to enable the intended experience. Chapter 14 discusses both  
multichannel design and ecosystem mapping in greater detail.  
# Value is a perceived benefit.  
# Focus on Aligning for Value  
Business magnate Warren Buffett once said, “Price is what  
you pay, value is what you get.” In other words, from the  
individual’s perspective value is a much richer, more dynamic  
concept than cost, involving human behavior and emotions.  
Value is a perceived benefit.  
Existing frameworks help us understand the subjective nature  
of the concept. Marketing professors Jagdish Sheth, Bruce  
Newman, and Barbara Gross\* identify five types of customer  
value\:  
•  
Functional value relates to the ability to perform a utilitar-  
ian purpose. Performance and reliability are key consider-  
ations with this type of value.  
•  
Social value refers to the interactions among people,  
emphasizing lifestyle and social awareness. For instance,  
Skype in the Classroom is a program aimed at inspiring  
students with prominent speakers who lecture from  
remote locations.  
•  
Emotional value emphasizes the feelings or affective  
responses a person has while interacting with an orga-  
nization’s offerings. For example, personal data security  
services tap into the fear of identity theft or data loss.  
\*  
Jagdish Sheth, Bruce Newman, and Barbara Gross, Consumption Values and  
Market Choices \(South-Western Publishing, 1991\).  
Focus on Aligning for Value 15FIGURE 1-10. This cross-channel blueprint by Tyler Tate aligns user behavior with channels and organizational support.  
16 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In •  
Epistemic value is generated by a sense of curiosity or a  
desire to learn. This type of value emphasizes personal  
growth and the acquisition of knowledge. The Khan  
Academy, for example, provides online courses that allow  
people to learn at their own pace.  
•  
Conditional value is a benefit that depends on specific  
situations or contexts. For instance, the perceived value of  
pumpkins and monster costumes increases conditionally  
just before Halloween in the US each year.  
Beyond these types, design strategist and educator Nathan  
Shedroff points to meaning as a form of what he calls “premi-  
um value.”\* This exceeds mere novelty and delight and looks  
at the purpose products and services have in our lives. Prod-  
ucts and services that provide meaningful experiences help us  
make sense of the world and give us personal identity.  
Together with coauthors Steve Diller and Darrel Rhea, She-  
droff identifies 15 types of premium value in the book Making  
Meaning\:  
1\. Accomplishment—The sense of pride in achieving goals  
2\. Beauty—The appreciation of aesthetic qualities that give  
pleasure to the senses  
3\. Community—A sense of connectedness with others  
around us  
4\. Creation—The satisfaction of having produced something  
\*  
See Nathan Shedroff’s talk at Interaction South America on the topic of design  
and value creation\: “Bridging Strategy with Design\: How Designers Create  
Value for Businesses” \(Nov 2014\).  
5\. Duty—The satisfaction of having fulfilled a responsibility  
6\. Enlightenment—The gratification of learning about a  
subject  
7\. Freedom—A sense of living without constraints  
8\. Harmony—The pleasure of balance between parts of a  
whole  
9\. Justice—The assurance of just and fair treatment  
10\. Oneness—A sense of unity with people and things that  
surround us  
11\. Redemption—Deliverance from past failure  
12\. Security—A freedom from worry about loss  
13\. Truth—A commitment to honesty and integrity  
14\. Validation—External recognition of one’s worth  
15\. Wonder—Experiencing something beyond  
comprehension  
Diagrams illuminate the human dynamics of value creation at  
all levels. When they embrace the subjective nature of value,  
they provide organizations an outside-in view of the value  
they actually create. Strive to include an indication of how  
value is perceived from the individual’s perspective.  
As a class of documents, alignment diagrams allow you to  
visualize and locate value within your offering ecosystem.  
From this you can ask\: What is your value proposition at each  
point in the experience? How is the organization meaningfully  
unique from the customer’s perspective? What meaning can  
you create for customers?  
Focus on Aligning for Value 17Principles of Alignment  
Understanding the common aspects of alignment diagrams  
opens up possibilities—you’re not limited to one approach  
over another. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind\:  
Show the big picture.  
Alignment diagrams focus on human behavior as part of a  
larger ecosystem. They are not about product research. As  
much as possible, look at what individuals do, think, and feel in  
a given context.  
Include multiple dimensions.  
Alignment diagrams illustrate multiple facets of information  
simultaneously. This is what the “alignment” part of the tech-  
nique is really all about. Common aspects on the user side  
include actions, thoughts, feelings, states of mind, goals, and  
pain points. On the organization side, typical elements include  
processes, actions, objectives, and metrics, as well as actors or  
roles involved.  
Show how value is exchanged.  
Alignment diagrams expose touchpoints and the context of  
those touchpoints. The multiple layers of information come  
together to show an exchange of value. As a result, alignment  
diagrams prototype experiences. It’s easy to walk through the  
touchpoints in slow motion, analyzing the broader circum-  
stances around each interaction.  
Visualize the experience.  
Alignment diagrams show a composite view of experiences in a  
graphical overview. It’s the immediacy of an all-at-once visual-  
ization that makes them powerful. A 10-page report or bulleted  
slides with the same information won’t have the same impact.  
Visualizations make otherwise abstract and invisible concepts  
like “user experience” tangible.  
Make it self-evident.  
Alignment diagrams should need little or no explanation.  
People can walk up to one and orient themselves relatively  
quickly. Keep in mind that a visual format itself does not guar-  
antee simplicity\: you’ll still have to work hard to reduce infor-  
mation to just the most salient points.  
Ensure relevancy to the organization.  
Alignment diagrams must be relevant to the organization. As  
the mapmaker, you must investigate and understand the goals,  
challenges, and future plans of the organization.  
Do the research.  
Alignment diagrams are grounded in investigation, not made up  
in isolation. They require some contact with the people in the  
real world through research and observation.  
18 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In Benefits of Alignment  
# Diagramming  
Alignment diagrams are no panacea. They do not provide immedi-  
ate answers outright. Instead, alignment diagrams are compelling  
visualizations that draw others into important conversations about  
creating value. Your ultimate goal is creating an inclusive dialogue  
within the organization, not creating the diagram itself. From this  
perspective, mapping experiences has many potential benefits\:  
Alignment diagramming fosters compassion for  
customers.  
It’s often amazing how little organizations know  
about the actual experiences of the people they serve.  
Alignment diagrams shed light on real-world human con-  
ditions. In doing so they not only instill empathy into an  
organization, but more importantly lead to compassionate  
action aimed at fulfilling individuals’ needs.  
Bruce Temkin, a leader in customer experience manage-  
ment, stresses the relevance and importance of such  
mapping activities. He writes in a blog post\:  
Companies need to use tools and processes that rein-  
force an understanding of actual customer needs. One of  
the key tools in this area is something called a customer  
journey map. … Used appropriately, these maps can shift  
a company’s perspective from inside-out to outside-in.\*  
\*  
Bruce Temkin, “It’s All About Your Customer’s Journey,” Experience Matters  
blog \(Mar 2010\).  
Looking into the organization from the outside causes a  
change in perspective, one that is more sensitive to peo-  
ple’s thoughts and feelings.  
Alignment diagramming provides a common “big  
picture.”  
Diagrams serve as a shared reference, helping to build  
consensus. In this sense, alignment diagrams are strategic  
tools\: they influence decision making at all levels and lead  
to consistency in actions.  
For instance, Jon Kolko, now partner at Modernist Studio,  
believes diagrams help address what he calls “alignment  
attrition”—the tendency for people to get out of sync  
with one another. He writes\:  
A visual model becomes one of the most effective  
tools for minimizing alignment attrition. A visual model  
captures and freezes a thought in time. By building a  
visual model together, alignment is offloaded to and  
“frozen in” the diagram. Your thoughts, opinions,  
and views will change, but the diagram won’t, and so  
you’ve added a constraining boundary to the idea—  
and a tool for concretely visualizing how the product  
vision is changing.†  
† Jon Kolko, “Dysfunctional Products Come from Dysfunctional Organizations,”  
Harvard Business Review \(Jan 2015\).  
Benefits of Alignment Diagramming 19This type of alignment is crucial in designing broad infor-  
mation architectures and shared information environ-  
ments. Alignment diagrams can provide a type of concep-  
tual scaffolding that allows organizations to conceive of  
services at scale.  
What’s more, diagrams also help retain a common big  
picture as organizations change personnel. Team mem-  
bers may come and go, and diagrams help maintain  
continuity. In this sense, maps also play a knowledge  
management role.  
Alignment diagramming breaks down silos.  
People experience a product or service holistically. Ideal  
solutions can easily cross an organization’s department  
lines. Illustrations of the customer experience typically  
reveal divisional joints in an organization. Discussion  
around them sparks cross-department collaboration.  
But be warned\: alignment diagrams often bring incon-  
venient truths with them. Silo busting is rarely a simple  
affair. Pointing out flaws and unknown phenomena may  
be met with resistance. Alignment begins by first expos-  
ing inconsistencies and then convincing others to embrace  
them, not necessarily for their own gain, but to the bene-  
fit of the customer.  
For large enterprises, a view across functions from the  
individual’s perspective is crucial for creating great cus-  
tomer experiences.  
20 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In  
# Alignment diagrams are compelling  
# visualizations that draw others  
# into important conversations  
# about creating value.  
Alignment diagramming brings focus.  
In a study in 2011 by Booz and Company,  
\* a majority of  
the 1,800 executives surveyed indicated they were unable  
to focus on business strategy\: they were being pulled in  
too many directions. As a result, many companies lack  
coherence.  
Coherence in business strategy—or incoherence, as is  
often the case—is the subject of The Essential Advantage  
by Paul Leinwand and Cesare Mainardi. After years of  
research in corporate strategy, the authors conclude\:  
To unlock the benefits of coherence, you need to take  
deliberate steps—to reconsider your current strategy,  
overcome the conventional separation between your  
outward-facing and inward-facing activities, and bring  
your organization into focus.  
Alignment diagrams represent such a deliberate step\:  
they inherently match outward- and inward-facing  
endeavors. In doing so, they bring focus and coherency to  
organizations.  
\*  
Booz and Company, “Executives Say They’re Pulled in Too Many Directions and  
That Their Company’s Capabilities Don’t Support Their Strategy” \(Feb 2011\). Alignment diagramming reveals opportunities.  
Visualizations offer an immediacy of comprehension,  
providing insight into previously unnoticed value-creation  
opportunities. Indi Young describes this potential in a  
common response to her mental model diagrams from  
stakeholders\:  
I have invited executives to presentations 15 minutes  
earlier than other folks, so they can stand in front of  
the diagram on the wall and walk from the left to  
right, asking me questions as they go. As I answer  
their questions, I explain how it will be used to direct  
product design. This kind of walkthrough is quick, to  
the point, and stays in the context of “missed” and  
“future” opportunities that executives usually focus  
on. Many executives have told me that they’ve never  
before seen all this information collected so succinctly  
in one place.†  
While the diagrams themselves don’t give an immediate  
solution, their presentation to the team often has an aha  
effect. They pinpoint areas for improvement in both oper-  
ational efficiency and experience design, as well as expos-  
ing opportunities for growth. Good diagrams are both  
compelling and engaging, providing an outside-in view of  
the organization.  
† Indi Young, Mental Models \(Rosenfeld Media, 2009\).  
Alignment diagrams enjoy longevity.  
Mapping an experience is a foundational activity. Because  
alignment diagrams uncover fundamental human needs  
and emotions, the data is not volatile. Once completed,  
diagrams tend not to change very quickly; they generally  
remain valid for years. From this perspective, mapping is  
best viewed as an investment with ongoing, long-term  
benefits rather than a project-level activity.  
Alignment diagramming goes beyond commercial  
settings.  
In the broadest sense of the word, an “experience”  
reflects the human condition, not just a customer’s rela-  
tionship with a service provider. While this book focuses  
on commercial contexts, mapping techniques can be used  
in a range of situations, including social arenas, govern-  
ment, and beyond. I’ve seen mapping used in learning  
design, urban planning and improvement, and helping  
protect the environment. The possibilities are endless.  
Benefits of Alignment Diagramming 21Summary  
This chapter introduced the concept of alignment diagrams,  
a category of diagrams that visually align individuals’ experi-  
ences with an organization. It is an umbrella term for various  
contemporary approaches. Thus, alignment diagrams are not  
a specific method but rather a reframing of existing practices.  
Examples of alignment diagrams include customer journey  
maps, service blueprints, experience maps, and mental model  
diagrams. There are more examples, shown throughout this  
book. Like other models used in business design, such as per-  
sonas, alignment diagrams make the abstract concrete.  
There are many benefits to alignment diagrams\:  
•  
When properly crafted, they build empathy and ultimately  
compassion, shifting an organization’s view from inside-  
out to outside-in.  
•  
Alignment diagrams give teams a common big picture.  
•  
Mapping experiences helps break organizational silos.  
•  
Visualizations bring focus to organizations.  
•  
Alignment diagrams point to opportunities for improve-  
ment and innovation.  
22 Chapter 1\: Visualizing Value\: Aligning Outside-In  
Alignment diagrams also enjoy substantial longevity. They are  
based on fundamental human needs and emotions. Once  
completed, they tend not to change quickly. Finally, alignment  
diagramming goes beyond commercial settings and can be  
applied to a wide range of situations in which understanding  
experiences is required.  
Alignment diagrams are foundational. They don’t provide  
answers or solutions directly, but facilitate conversation and  
stimulate deeper reflection. As complexity in business increas-  
es, such approaches are no longer nice to have\: they are im-  
perative tools for organizations to learn about the experiences  
they create. Further Reading

This full-length book makes end-to-end service design  
actionable with a wealth of examples and hands-on,  
practical techniques. While creating a diagram plays a  
large role in the process, the authors’ approach looks  
far beyond mapping into the complexity of aligning  
modern organizations. This is a highly recommended  
resource.  
Gianluca Brugnoli, “Connecting the Dots of User Experience,”  
Journal of Information Architecture \(Apr 2009\)  
Brugnoli provides some practical tips on how to map  
systems. The highlight of the article is his customer  
journey matrix. He observes\: “The user experience  
takes shape on many interconnected devices and  
through various interfaces and networks used in many  
different contexts and situations.”  
Jess McMullin, “Searching for the Center of Design,” Boxes  
and Arrows \(Sep 2003\)  
In this article, McMullin calls for us to think beyond  
user-centered design and embrace value-centered  
design. This fundamental principle underlies the basic  
notion of alignment diagrams.

greatly helped develop the concept of alignment  
diagrams.

Benefits of Alignment Diagramming 23CASE STUDY  
# Fighting Violent Extremism with Alignment Diagramming  
In November of 2016, I was asked to lead a mapping workshop  
for Hedayah, a nongovernmental organization \(NGO\) based  
in Abu Dhabi involved in countering violent extremism \(CVE\).  
The project was focused on understanding the experience of  
ex-violent extremists, called “formers,” after they disengage  
from their hate groups.  
Formers are valuable to CVE efforts. They can hear “dog whistles”  
\(or encoded messages that appear normal to the general public\)  
and see the extremist groups from the inside out. Additionally,  
people currently looking to leave hate groups often confide in  
formers because they understand what it means to disengage.  
My sponsor came to the idea that mapping formers’ experienc-  
es would provide insight into how to recruit more of them. A  
search for “mapping experiences” led them to my work, and  
they invited me to lead the workshop. I accepted the job on a  
pro bono basis and started planning my trip to Abu Dhabi and  
the workshop.  
# Getting the Right Scope  
Not knowing much about violent extremism, I did some initial  
investigation into formers ahead of the event. At a minimum, I  
wanted to understand enough to be able to keep up with ex-  
perts in the field, as well as sketch out a hypothesis experience  
map to be validated and completed in the workshop.  
But my preliminary exploration turned out to be off track. I  
had misunderstood the brief and defined the experience to be  
mapped at the wrong level. The top half of Figure 1-11 shows  
the overall experience I started mapping erroneously, from  
becoming radicalized to disengaging and then integrating back  
into society—basically all of violent extremism.  
It dawned on me that this was too broad for a single workshop,  
and I wouldn’t be able to facilitate a conversation on such a  
wide range of topics. My hunch was right, and I clarified the  
scope with my stakeholder in a follow-up call.  
The lower part of Figure 1-11 shows the updated focus. It’s  
much narrower, centered specifically on why some formers get  
involved in fighting hate and others don’t. Setting the right  
scope with the main stakeholder was critical to the project’s  
success.  
# Running the Workshop  
At the workshop in Abu Dhabi there were seven formers from a  
range of groups, including ex-white supremacists, ex-Al Qaeda,  
and ex-gang members, who had all chosen to get involved in  
fighting hate. In addition, there were nine other participants  
from various CVE organizations, including the US State Depart-  
ment and other NGOs. It was nerve-racking for me, as I was  
unsure any of it would work.

FIGURE 1-11. Two preliminary experience maps show different levels of granularity.  
Case Study\: Fighting Violent Extremism with Alignment Diagramming﻿ 25CASE STUDY  
I planned the workshop as I would a typical experience mapping  
workshop. The focus was, of course, a group mapping exercise to  
foster a broad discussion about how the formers got involved in  
CVE themselves \(see the images in Figure 1-12\). They indicated  
their actions, thoughts, and feelings during their journey to involve-  
ment. Together, we identified key moments to concentrate on and  
moved into ideation before developing concrete solutions together.  
Overall, the workshop was a success and garnered very positive  
feedback. One participant representing an NGO said, “This was  
the best hands-on workshop I’ve ever attended.” And a former  
who participated said about the workshop, “Experience mapping  
changed the way that I look at counter violent extremism. Culti-  
vating empathy by mapping an experience elevates the technique  
beyond just optimizing business performance and makes it an asset  
to building a more peaceful world.”  
# The Final Results  
My primary output from the multi-day session was a map of a  
former’s journey toward involvement, which was included in an  
in-depth analysis created by Hedayah. Figure 1-13 shows the path  
from guilt \(a common emotion after leaving an extremist group\) to-  
ward atonement, a primary motivation for getting involved in CVE.  
Overall, the session was an exploration of  
new ground\: no one had ever investigat-  
ed formers’ paths to involvement. In this  
sense, the project contributed to a broader,  
long-term understanding of why some  
formers get involved in CVE and others  
don’t.  
From my perspective, the effort reaffirmed  
the notion that techniques from mapping  
experiences can have a broader application  
outside of commercial settings. Indeed,  
after sharing my story in presentations at  
conferences and meet-ups, this example  
has inspired others I’ve met to consider  
social applications of creative techniques  
like mapping experiences in their own work  
and lives.

# Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
The cause of the great cholera outbreak in London in 1854  
was initially unclear. Prior to Louis Pasteur’s germ theory,  
many thought the disease was in the air. John Snow, a  
London physician, had a different explanation. He believed  
cholera was in the water. After microscopic examinations  
were inconclusive, Snow instead analyzed the spread of  
cholera to prove his hunch.  
To do this, Snow mapped cholera cases in Soho, London  
\(Figure 2-1\). The resulting patterns demonstrated causality\:  
proximity to a certain water pump correlated to cholera  
cases with high predictability. The decline of cholera is  
credited to Snow’s recommendation to shut down that  
pump.  
Snow’s map contained multiple layers of information—  
streets, houses with cholera cases, and water pumps—just  
enough to reveal previously undetected evidence \(in this  
case, the cause of a disease\). The approach was simple  
but effective, and Snow was able to generate a hypothesis  
based on his map\: if the city shut down a specific pump,  
then cases of cholera would decline.  
FIGURE 2-1. John Snow’s map of London during the great cholera outbreak of  
1854\. The red circle highlights the water pump that was the source of the disease.  
31Visualizations offer an immediacy of comprehension and help  
us arrive at such hypotheses. Maps show interrelationships in  
an ecosystem.  
It may not be immediately apparent, but I would argue  
that there is alignment in Snow’s example\: water \(a service  
provided by the waterworks department\), water pumps \(the  
touchpoints to that system\), and households with cholera in  
Soho \(individuals\). What Snow showed was that the means  
of treating and storing water miles away affected people in  
central London. This conclusion is generally credited with the  
start of public health practices around the world.  
This is why I love maps of all kinds\: they provide an overview  
and, with some creative imagination, show new relationships  
leading to new insights. Armed with only a map and a few  
data points, John Snow was able to see what the best micro-  
scopes of the time couldn’t. That’s powerful.  
Similarly, this is what experience mapping offers\: new insight.  
It starts with an investigation and illustration of the human  
condition and then works out ways to support people’s  
needs.  
Diagrams provide a systematic overview of the experiences  
people have. By fostering conversations across the organi-  
zation, the process of mapping helps avoid disjointed inter-  
actions and promotes coherency. Regardless of the specific  
diagram type you create, there are overarching aspects to  
consider in mapping experiences, covered in this chapter.  
These include\:  
32 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
1\. Framing the effort clearly. Determine the point of view,  
scope, and focus, as well as the structure of the diagram  
and how you intend to use it.  
2\. Identifying the various touchpoints in the system, as well  
as critically charged points, called “moments of truth.”  
3\. Focusing on creating value. Use the diagram to improve  
and to innovate your offering and your business.  
By the end of this chapter, you should have a greater understanding  
of the key decisions in mapping experiences.  
# Frame the Mapping Effort  
The term experience defies precise definition. Still, we can  
point to some common aspects to better understand it\:  
Experiences are holistic.  
The notion of an experience is all-encom­ passing, includ-  
ing actions, thoughts, and feelings over time.  
Experiences are personal.  
An experience is not an objective property of a product or  
service; it’s the subjective perception of the individual.  
Experiences are situational.  
I like riding on roller coasters, but not immediately after  
eating a large meal. In one case, the experience is exhila-  
rating; in the other, it’s a dreadful few minutes of nausea.  
The roller coaster doesn’t change; the situation does.  
Experiences differ from situation to situation. FIGURE 2-2. Harry Beck created his iconic map of the London Underground in 1933.  
Frame the Mapping Effort 33How, then, do we approach mapping experiences? Put simply,  
it’s a matter of selection. Maps are purposefully focused.  
As the mapmaker, it’s up to you to decide which aspects to  
include and which to leave out.  
Cartographic maps, for instance, are selective in what they  
show. Consider Harry Beck’s famous map of the London  
Underground, first published in 1933 \(Figure 2-2\). It is sparing  
in what it includes\: Tube lines, stops, exchanges, and the River  
Thames—nothing more.  
This map also distorts the train lines, relying only on horizon-  
tal, vertical, and 45-degree angled lines. Stops are spaced  
equidistantly as well, when in reality the distances vary greatly.  
That’s OK\: maps are abstractions of the real world.  
Beck’s map has remained virtually intact for over 70  
years, with only minor updates. Its brilliance lies in  
what it doesn’t show\: streets, buildings, curves in  
lines, and actual distances between stops. The lon-  
gevity of Beck’s map is due to its appropriateness—it  
fulfills a specific need extremely well.  
Likewise, mapping experiences requires choice. Dis-  
tortions will necessarily occur, but if your definition  
of the effort is on target, the overall message will be  
valid. And of course, the framing of your project must  
be relevant to the organization and address its goals.  
Before starting the mapping effort, there are three fundamen-  
tal aspects to define, shown in Figure 2-3\:  
1\. Point of view—Whose experience are you mapping and  
which experiences are included?  
2\. Scope—When does the experience begin and end?  
3\. Focus—What types of information will be included?  
4\. Additionally, the structure of the diagram should best be  
determined in advance, along with the intended uses.  
As the mapmaker, it’s your responsibility to get agreement  
on each of these aspects from the key stakeholders who will  
ultimately be the audience of the diagram. Each is discussed in  
detail in the following sections.  
1\. Point of view  
2\. Scope  
3\. Focus  
FIGURE 2-3. Define every mapping effort by addressing three key criteria up front.  
34 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences Point of View  
The point of view of a diagram should answer the question,  
“Whose perspective are you taking in the diagram?” In  
some cases, this may be obvious. But in other contexts—for  
instance, more complex B2B situations—there may be half a  
dozen or more actors involved in a given experience with a  
variety of interdependent interactions. You’ll need to first sort  
out which experiences to map.  
News consumption  
Another point of view might be to look at how readers  
consume news in general. This would situate the mag-  
azine within a broader spectrum of human information  
behavior. This point of view could be beneficial if the  
magazine is looking to expand its offering. A mental  
model diagram could be useful in this case.  
Day-in-the-life  
Point of view is given by two criteria\: the people involved and  
the types of experiences they engage in. For example, a news  
magazine might serve two distinct audiences\: readers and  
advertisers. The interactions  
each has with the publisher are  
very different.  
You could also look at a day in the life of typical readers\:  
how does a news magazine fit into their daily actions?  
Where do they come in contact with the magazine?  
When? What else do they  
# As the mapmaker, it’s up to you to  
do to find and read news?  
# decide which aspects to include

# and which to leave out.  
appropriate for mapping this  
experience.  
people to focus on—assume  
readers in this example—there are different experiences to  
choose from. Consider these three potential experiences for a  
news magazine reader\:  
Each of these points of view has a different unit of analysis—  
purchasing, consuming news, or a daily routine. And each can  
be beneficial depending on the needs of the organization.  
Understanding the point of view of the diagram is critical in  
Purchasing behavior  
determining your approach and resulting message.  
One point of view is to look at how readers purchase the  
news magazine\: how they first heard of the magazine,  
why they bought it, if they make a repeat purchase, and  
so on. Mapping an experience from this point of view  
makes sense if there is a need to optimize sales. A cus-  
Typically, any given diagram reflects a single point of view. A  
clear perspective generally strengthens the message of a dia-  
gram. It’s common to include a reference to a persona in the  
top corner of an experience map to clarify the point of view  
for the diagram’s audience.  
tomer journey map would be a good fit.  
Frame the Mapping Effort 35But, as mentioned in Chapter 1, a map may coordinate  
multiple points of view. Still, you’ll have to define whose  
experiences and which experiences to include. Oftentimes, a  
primary point of view is defined and secondary perspectives  
are aligned to that.  
There’s no right or wrong answer to the question of how  
to determine a point of view for your mapping effort. What  
you decide to illustrate depends on your stakeholders’ needs.  
Strive to align the point of view of the map with the goals of  
the organization.  
# Scope  
Scope is fairly straightforward to understand\: you need to  
answer the question, “When does the experience begin and  
when does it end?” Think about scope as the left and right  
sides of a chronological diagram. Sometimes the scope of a  
mapping effort may seem self-evident, but additional con-  
cerns can extend the start and stop points you’ll define.  
Consider the previous example of riding a roller coaster. Does  
it begin when you get strapped into the car or while you’re  
waiting in line? Or does it begin before you even get to the  
amusement park, while you’re still at  
home, or even before that? And when  
does it end—when you get out of the  
roller coaster car or when you look at  
the photos of yourself during the ride?  
Or does it end when you look at those  
photos a month later?  
It’s up to you, the mapmaker, to define  
the scope of the experience to be illus-  
trated. There are no right or wrong an-  
swers; it depends on the needs of the  
project. I’ll often find an obvious point  
in time to start and then go back one  
step to include the precursors before  
the beginning of an experience.  
FIGURE 2-4. An experience map can include elements before the main experience even begins, such  
as the “past experiences” in this diagram.  
36 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences For instance, on one project we were seeking to foster a more  
customer-centric mindset in employees of an organization.  
We initially scoped the employee experience to start around  
the first day of employment. However, by going back in time  
to the phases prior to that, including the recruiting and hiring  
phases, we found even more opportunities to increase cus-  
tomer centricity \(e.g., instilling the desired mindset during the  
hiring process or including our intent in the job posting\).  
The diagram in Figure 2-4 shows a close-up of the first part  
of an experience map for different types of gamers created by  
Gene Smith and Trevor van  
Gorp \(shown in full in Figure  
12-4\). Notice that they define  
the beginning of the experi-  
ence as “Past Experiences”—  
an explicit recognition that  
people bring past experiences  
into the one mapped here. The scope of this diagram is broad-  
er than just playing games, which can help point to previously  
unconsidered opportunities.  
But scope is deeper than just the beginning and end of an ex-  
perience. It also requires a tradeoff in granularity. A map of an  
end-to-end experience reveals the big picture but leaves out  
detail. On the other hand, a detailed diagram may illustrate  
specific interactions but cover less ground.  
The equally spaced Tube stops on Beck’s map of the London  
Underground \(see Figure 2-2\), for instance, allow the entire  
system to fit on one page. Actual spacing would have put the  
end stations far off the page. Given his scope—to show the  
entire system—this lack of fidelity was necessary.  
Or, imagine you’ve been contracted by the tourist bureau of  
a city in the US to improve the experience of visiting tourists,  
with a specific goal of increasing the mobile services offered.  
One approach could be to scope the entire visit, starting from  
planning at home, to visiting the city, and all the way to fol-  
low-up actions afterward. This would give you a broad picture  
across different touchpoint types across the entire service  
ecology for multiple stakeholders.  
# Understanding the point of view of the  
# diagram is critical in determining your  
# approach and resulting message.  
In another approach, you  
could limit the effort to only  
experiences in the city with  
mobile services. This journey  
might begin at the point  
of arrival and end when  
departing the city, but would provide greater depth on mobile  
touchpoints for a particular user type.  
Both approaches are valid depending on the needs of the  
organization, as well as its interests and gaps in knowledge.  
Are you focused on a discrete problem or do you need a view  
of the entire system? The point is to be explicit about the  
tradeoffs you’re making up front and set the right expecta-  
tions. Setting the right scope will guide subsequent compre-  
hension of the experience, as well as what strategic opportu-  
nities might emerge.  
Frame the Mapping Effort 37Focus  
What types of information will you include in the diagram?  
What’s the diagram about? Think of the focus as the rows of  
information in a given map. That defines the content you’ll  
include.  
Again, it’s up to you, the mapmaker, to choose which aspects  
to focus on. Strive to make it relevant to your organization  
and stakeholders’ needs.  
There are many types of elements to consider. The ones you  
choose depend on how you’ve framed the effort \(see Chapter  
5\) and what aspects are most salient to the organization.  
I typically start with the actions, thoughts, and feelings of  
the individual as a default way to describe an experience, in  
general. Your project may require emphasis on other foci.  
To make your map relevant to your team, you might include  
some of the following typical aspects\:  
•  
Physical\: artifacts, tools, devices  
•  
Behavioral\: actions, activities, tasks  
•  
Cognitive\: thoughts, views, opinions  
•  
Emotional\: feelings, desires, states of mind  
•  
Needs\: goals, outcomes, jobs to be done  
•  
Challenges\: pain points, constraints, barriers  
•  
Context\: setting, environment, location  
•  
Culture\: beliefs, values, philosophy  
•  
Events\: triggers, moments of truth, points of failure

Elements that describe the organization can include\:

•

Touchpoints\: mediums, devices, information

Opportunities\: gaps, weaknesses, redundancies  
Goals\: revenue, savings, reputation

The question of balance of the above elements comes into  
play as well. I recommend listing a set of target aspects that  
are most relevant to your mapping effort, starting with the Individual

FIGURE 2-5. Focus differs across  
diagram types.

suggestions here. Then, arrange them in a sketch of a map to  
see how they might fit together to meet your goals.  
Also keep in mind that different diagram types naturally  
have different foci \(see Figure 2-5\). For instance, a customer  
journey map may focus primarily on an experience with only  
a minimal description of the organization. A service blueprint,  
on the other hand, may highlight the service provision process  
across channels at the expense of a detailed description of the  
user experience.  
# Structure  
Alignment diagrams also differ in structure. The most com-  
mon scheme is chronological \(Figure 2-6a\), and many of the  
examples in this book have a chronological organization.  
However, other arrangements are possible, including hierar-  
chical, spatial, and network structures \(Figures 2-6b to 2-6d\).  
Figure 2-7 is a map of the guest experience with the service  
Booking.com. It’s an excellent example of illustrating an expe-  
rience using a network-like structure. The focus is on touch-  
points that lead to positive or negative experiences.  
Frame the Mapping Effort 39Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4  
# Time  
FIGURE 2-6a. CHRONOLOGICAL\: Because experiences happen in real  
time, a chronological arrangement provides a natural sequence of human  
behavior. A timeline of some sort is the most prevalent way to structure  
alignment diagrams. See Chapters 10–12 on service blueprints, customer  
journey maps, and experience maps for more.  
# Space  
FIGURE 2-6c. SPATIAL\: It’s also possible to illustrate experiences spatially.  
This makes sense when interactions take place in a physical location—for  
example, in a face-to-face service encounter. Spatial diagrams can also be  
imposed on an experience in a metaphorical sense\: spatial maps represent  
experiences as if they could exist in a 3D space even when they do not.  
# Hierarchy  
FIGURE 2-6b. HIERARCHICAL\: Mapping experiences hierarchically removes  
the time dimension. This can have advantages when there are many aspects  
occurring simultaneously, which is difficult to show chronologically. Chapter  
13 discusses mental model diagrams and other hierarchical arrangements.  
40 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
# Network  
FIGURE 2-6d. NETWORK STRUCTURE\: A network structure shows a web  
of interrelationships between aspects of an experience that are neither  
chronological nor hierarchical. FIGURE 2-7. A network-like arrangement of actors and concepts shows positive and negative experiences with Booking.com.  
Frame the Mapping Effort 41Use  
Keep the intended use of an alignment diagram in mind from  
the very beginning.  
First, consider who will be consuming the information in your  
diagram. The London Underground map is read every day by  
travelers on the Tube. They use it to determine how to travel  
between any two points on the network. But the engineers  
who maintain the switching signals in the London Under-  
ground would likely find Beck’s map lacking in detail—they  
need specifications with a much higher degree of fidelity to  
accomplish their work. Beck’s map is not intended for that  
audience.  
Also consider what you’ll use your diagrams for. Frame the ef-  
fort in a way that is appropriate for your team’s needs. What  
questions does the organization have that a diagram can  
address? What gaps in knowledge does it fill? What problems  
will it help solve?  
Finally, ask yourself how the diagram will be used. Will it  
be used to diagnose problems or improve the design of an  
existing system? Will it be used to create a strategy and plan  
for development? Or does your audience intend to use your  
alignment diagram to discover new opportunities for innova-  
tion and growth?  
The type of mapping advocated in this book is best suited  
for generative activities; that is, teams can use maps of the  
current state of an experience to creatively find opportunities  
42 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
together. From this perspective, a map serves as springboard  
into conversations about what might be possible in the future.  
A future state map may or may not be needed, depending on  
the solutions generated.  
Mapping can also serve a summative function. Journey  
management is a rapidly growing field that coordinates live  
data \(e.g., satisfaction scores, usage metrics\) to touchpoints in  
customer experience for ongoing monitoring. Teams can see  
data about the experience people are actually having in real  
time at each stage in the journey.  
# Identify Touchpoints  
Framing the effort, as outlined above, provides a basis for  
illustrating the overall experience. Within that experience, you  
also need to consider the relationship between individuals and  
an organization. The concept of touchpoints, the means of  
value exchange, allows you to show the interaction between  
the two.  
Typically, touchpoints include a range of things, such as\:  
•  
TV ads, print ads, brochures  
•  
Marketing emails, newsletters  
•  
Websites, blogs, online newsletters  
•  
Apps, software programs  
•  
Phone calls, service hotlines, online chat  
•  
Service counters, checkout registers •  
Physical objects, buildings, roads  
•  
Packaging, shipping materials  
•  
Bills, invoices, payment systems  
Historically, there are three primary types of touchpoints\:  
Static  
These touchpoints don’t allow for users to interact with  
them. They include things such as printed materials, signage,  
or advertisements.  
Interactive  
Websites and apps are interactive touchpoints, often with  
a call to action and workflow to follow.  
Human  
This type involves human-to-human interaction. Examples  
include a sales representative or a support agent on the  
phone, as well as hosted communities and forums.  
Organizations that take an ecological view of the experiences  
they provide have a competitive advantage. For business-  
es, this impacts the bottom line. One study from 2013 by  
Alex Rawson and colleagues found that optimization across  
touchpoints was a strong predictor of business health.\* The  
researchers found a 20% to 30% correlation with improved  
outcomes, such as higher revenue, better retention, and posi-  
tive word of mouth. Reducing friction and providing a coher-  
ent experience pays off.

Experience,” Harvard Business Review \(Sep 2013\).  
Consider the inventory of touchpoints in Figure 2-8. This  
diagram was created by the Swiss-based marketing firm  
Accelerom \(accelerom.com\), an international consultancy and  
research firm based in Zurich, as part of its 360° touchpoint  
management process.† This shows a fairly comprehensive list  
of touchpoints a company has with its customers.  
But some people call for a broader perspective. Chris Risdon,  
for one, defines a touchpoint as the context around an inter-  
action. In his article “Un-Sucking the Touchpoint” he writes\:  
A touchpoint is a point of interaction involving a spe-  
cific human need in a specific time and place.  
Jeannie Walters, a leading customer experience consultant,  
also advocates a broader definition. She is critical of touch-  
point inventories, writing\:  
The challenge with viewing touchpoints this way is this  
approach often assumes the customer has a\) been in a  
linear and direct relationship with the organization and  
b\) reads and engages with these touchpoints in mean-  
ingful ways. In short, an examination of touchpoints is  
often entirely company-focused. \(Sometimes, it is so  
company-focused the touchpoints are categorized by  
org chart\: marketing; operations; billing, etc.\).‡

44 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences But the notion of touchpoint visualization can be useful be-  
yond commercial settings that seek to optimize brand percep-  
tion and profits. Matt Sinclair, Leila Sheldrick, Mariale Moreno,  
and Emma Dewberry have developed a unique tool for look-  
ing at the touchpoints across a broad ecosystem. Working in  
the field of circular design, or the creation of products beyond  
single lifecycles for single users, they wanted to visualize the  
points within an ecosystem where stakeholders can intervene  
in the product’s journey to extend its life. See the case study  
at the end of the chapter for more on circular design and  
Consumer Intervention Maps.  
Alignment diagrams, in general, reinforce an ecological view  
of the interaction with customers. They not only illustrate  
individual touchpoints but also provide an end-to-end picture  
of the experience. The insight from mapping goes beyond just  
delighting customers and optimizing consumption; it has stra-  
tegic underpinnings that can include innovation in means of  
production, product lifecycles, and more sustainable design.  
# Moments of Truth  
Alignment diagrams are not just collections of touchpoints.  
They also provide insight for identifying and understanding  
critical points in the experience. Called moments of truth ,  
these key emotional instances help focus attention on the  
aspects that matter most.  
Moments of truth can be thought of as a special type of  
touchpoint. They are critical, emotionally charged interactions,  
and usually occur when someone has invested a high degree  
of energy in a desired outcome. Moments of truth either make  
or break the relationship—they’re the crux of the interaction.  
For example, when purchasing a new home, the selection of  
which property to buy will likely be a moment of truth.  
The term “moments of truth” was popularized by Jan Carl-  
zon, the then CEO of SAS Airlines, in his book of the same  
name. To illustrate his point, Carlzon starts his book with a  
story of a customer who arrived at the airport without his  
boarding pass. The SAS agents personally drove back to the  
hotel where he’d left it and delivered it to him at the airport.  
This left an indelible impression on the customer.  
Moments of truth point to opportunities for innovation and  
growth. For instance, in their book The Innovator’s Method ,  
business scholars and consultants Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer  
suggest creating what they call “journey lines,” or a brief visu-  
alization of the steps customers take. They write\:  
Create an in-depth visual portrait in which you identify  
pain points to understand how your customers do the  
job today and how they feel while doing it. Visually  
map out the steps customers take to achieve an out-  
come. It helps to assign a customer emotion to each  
step to identify how the customer is feeling.  
They go on to recommend looking for moments “that ignite  
their emotions”—in other words, moments of truth. Solutions  
that address these moments, they claim, are more likely to be  
monetizable\: people are generally willing to pay for services  
that address critical needs. In this sense, moments of truth are  
points of opportunity for the organization.  
Identify Touchpoints 45Focusing on moments of truth allows you to concentrate your  
energy on experiences that matter. The perceived coheren-  
cy of your offering is given by how you handle moments of  
truth. Diagrams provide insight into these points across time,  
allowing organizations to design a more cohesive experience  
and reduce transitional volatility.  
# Summary  
Historically, visual alignment has helped people make sense of  
the world. Take John Snow’s map of cholera cases in London  
in 1854\: he was able to literally see the cause of an outbreak  
by layering different elements in a map. Visualizing experience  
can have a similar effect.  
But unlike physical spaces, experiences are frustratingly intan-  
gible and broad. As the mapmaker, it’s your job to frame the  
diagram and the experiences you’ll be mapping. This includes  
decisions about the perspective, scope, and focus, as well as  
structure and use. Chapter 5 discusses the process of selec-  
tion in more detail.  
46 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
Touchpoints are the means by which interactions between indi-  
viduals and an organization can take place. Typically, these are  
seen in terms of interaction with an advertisement, application,  
or website, or through a service encounter or phone call.  
A broader definition of touchpoints, however, includes the  
whole context in which these interactions occur. An interac-  
tion between an individual and an organization happens at  
a given time and within a given environment. Organizations  
that design for and manage coherency across touchpoints see  
enormous benefits\: greater satisfaction, stronger loyalty, and  
larger returns.  
Moments of truth are critical, emotionally intense moments.  
They are those instances that make or break a relationship.  
Identifying the moments of truth points to potential opportu-  
nities for innovation.  
From the individual’s perspective, value is subjective and  
complex. There are many types of value they may consider\:  
functional, emotional, social, epistemic, and circumstantial.  
Premium value goes beyond these types to include meaning  
and identity. Further Reading

# Case Study Title  
# Consumer Intervention Mapping—Designing  
# Strategies for the Circular Economy  
by tk  
by Matt Sinclair  
Circular design is an approach to the conception and creation  
of products and services that emphasizes looking beyond single  
product lifecycles for single users, and instead treats products  
as entities within systems that allow multiple users and usages.  
The idea of Consumer Intervention Mapping came about when  
our research team was involved in an Engineering and Physi-  
cal Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\) project looking at how  
circular design could be integrated with redistributed manufac-  
turing—the type of manufacturing that can occur when pro-  
duction machinery is smaller, cheaper, and more easily localized  
\(3D printers are probably the best known example of this\).  
We realized that most strategic visions of a circular economy  
see the consumer as fairly disinterested in anything except  
consuming. But there is also this whole other idea of the  
consumer, as someone who is engaged, even if to a relatively  
small degree, in designing, making, repairing, and reselling  
products whose lifecycles do not match those of conventionally  
conceived consumer goods.  
Touchpoint diagrams in commercial settings typically concen-  
trate only on experiences that occur within the value chain  
a brand is able to influence. Consumer interventions such as  
post-purchase modification, repair, lending, and resale often  
receive little attention because brands cannot monetize them.  
We realized there is a whole ecosystem of activities going  
on, carried out by people who are interested in ideas that are  
central to the circular economy that never appear on brands’  
touchpoint diagrams.  
Consumer Intervention Maps were our way of trying to capture  
these activities, partly because we found them interesting in  
their own right, but also because we felt that drawing attention  
to them might encourage brands to think about how to design  
for them. Figure 2-9 shows the underlying framework for Con-  
sumer Intervention Mapping.  
The design of the map follows a conventional brand touchpoint  
wheel, in which touchpoints are defined at the top level as  
pre-purchase, purchase, or post-purchase experiences. These  
are subdivided into a further six categories, including new  
product development \(something brands rarely see as an area  
for consumer involvement\), and then divided again into 18  
categories, including maintenance and disposal \(again, areas  
that brands often leave out of touchpoint diagrams\).  
48 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences CASE STUDY  
FIGURE 2-9. The Consumer Intervention space visualizes the broader circular design ecosystem.  
Case Study\: Consumer Intervention Mapping—Designing Strategies for the Circular Economy 49CASE STUDY  
A further refinement is to add concentric rings that indicate the  
degree of control a brand exerts when a consumer intervenes  
in the product’s lifecycle \(for example, a brand has much more  
control when a consumer uses an authorized dealer for a repair,  
rather than purchasing a gray market spare part and repairing a  
product themselves\).  
A touchpoint on the map refers to an event in which a stake-  
holder actively and intentionally intervenes in a product’s  
intended customer journey model. Passive touchpoints that do  
not involve consumer intervention are excluded \(e.g., seeing an  
ad\). Touchpoints are indicated in their appropriate phases using  
a system of color-coding\: manufacturing \(orange\), communica-  
tion \(pink\), supply \(blue\), and usage \(green\). The darkness of  
the color shows the degree to which a brand allows consumers  
to intervene at this touchpoint.  
Starting in the definition phase of new product development, a  
line connects touchpoints to describe a product’s lifecycle from  
pre-purchase to post-purchase. Figure 2-10 shows an example  
product lifecycle for an imaginary, mass-customized product, in  
which disposal involves extracting materials during remanufac-  
turing and feeding them back into new product development.  
The diagram is populated with touchpoints found from litera-  
ture and from three workshops conducted with experts from  
industry and academia, including one held at the Institute of  
Mechanical Engineers in London and one at the Product Life-  
times and the Environment conference in Delft. Each workshop  
50 Chapter 2\: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences  
allowed participants to question and reposition touchpoints,  
and to add new touchpoints that hadn’t previously been iden-  
tified. In this way, the resulting diagram \(shown in Figure 2-11\)  
was validated and improved.  
In addition, we ran exercises that asked participants to imagine  
scenarios for product service systems within future circular  
economies and to visualize these using the Consumer Interven-  
tion Map.  
To a large extent the value of the tool has been seen in the  
discussions that have arisen from these exercises, and the way  
that alternative visions of product strategies and business mod-  
els have emerged. A number of participants have commented  
that it is refreshing to be asked to consider possibilities, rather  
than constraints, and that the tool’s focus on users introduces  
a perspective that many had not previously considered. This is  
something we are keen to continue through further collabora-  
tions as the tool develops.

# Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside  
There was a deli around the corner from my previous home  
in Hamburg, Germany, that had quality meats and specialty  
items. I used to stop in every so often to get products that  
were otherwise hard to find. But the service was often rude  
and abrupt. I sometimes felt nervous interacting with the  
servers, who might get annoyed if I asked about the different  
types of salami they had, for instance, as if I should already  
know all the subtleties.  
My wife worked in the area and knew a lot of the neighborhood  
businesses. When I brought up the abrasive service I had expe-  
rienced, she immediately said, “Not surprising\: the owners are  
exactly like that too. They are difficult people to deal with.”  
And to be sure, they had a high employee turnover.  
The point is that organizations are often mirrors of the  
customer experiences they deliver. If employees are treat-  
ed poorly behind the scenes, how can they be expected to  
provide good service to customers? If management sets a bad  
example for interacting with customers, why should employ-  
ees act any differently?  
Melvin Conway, a computer programmer, observed that the  
solutions organizations produce reflect their own communi-  
cation structures. Dubbed “Conway’s law,” his observation  
highlights the power of organizational design\: how a compa-  
ny operates is as important as what it produces.  
If great customer experiences are informed from the outside  
in, they are built from an inside-across alignment. It’s a two-  
step process, as shown in Figure 3-1. First, an organization  
has to be deeply attuned to the indi-  
viduals it serves. Then, teams have  
to be aligned not only to the ideal  
customer experience, but also to  
# Individual  
one another.  
# Organization  
# 2\. Inside-across  
# alignment  
# 1\. Outside-in  
# alignment  
FIGURE 3-1. There are two types of  
alignment\: alignment to the experience,  
which happens from the outside in, and  
internal \(inside-across\) alignment between  
the teams that create the experience.  
57This chapter discusses the concept of internal alignment  
through the lens of employee experience. As the customer ex-  
perience \(CX\) becomes more imperative for business growth,  
the employee experience \(EX\) will too be critical for success.  
Said another way, the path to becoming more customer-centric  
is to be more employee-centric by creating a great employee  
experience. The two—CX and EX—are inextricably linked.  
Mapping heightens alignment along both dimensions, helping  
to intentionally coordinate them.  
# Employee Experience  
EX is a relatively new field that goes beyond smooth onboard-  
ing, proper workplace setup, and free perks. It’s about more  
than employee satisfaction, and even more than employee  
engagement.  
Instead, EX takes into the account the sum of the experienc-  
es—thoughts, actions, and feelings—an employee has with  
an organization over time. It’s about how they understand  
and internalize the vision and strategy of the organization, as  
well as the behaviors employees exhibit in working toward the  
company’s mission.  
Employee experience overlaps with existing functions in a  
company, such as HR or People Operations. In many ways,  
EX is an extension of those existing fields and represents a  
modern way to manage a workforce through the lens of the  
overall experience. But it’s broader than the typical scope of  
HR functions.  
58 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside  
EX also overlaps with the notion of company culture, but has  
important distinctions. Culture is the tacit beliefs and philos-  
ophies of a group of people and their collective assumptions  
about how the world is. EX is how employees live the compa-  
ny culture over time.  
Ultimately, EX is an explicit recognition that employees have  
the potential freedom to change jobs. While in reality many  
may be tied to a role and can’t just leave, EX positions itself  
as if there were free choice. In other words, it’s not enough to  
have a workforce that works happily for a company \(i.e., for  
a salary and benefits\). Instead, an enlightened organization  
also create a sense of belonging, so people want to join its  
cause. EX is about the purpose that comes along with em-  
ployment—a purpose that is as strong \(or stronger\) a reason  
to work than money alone.  
With this in mind, a holistic set of contributing factors emerg-  
es, including many of the following\:  
•  
Physical and digital spaces, including tools and equipment  
•  
Internal systems, capabilities, and support  
•  
Flexibility, autonomy, and transparency  
•  
Feeling valued and having a sense of agency  
•  
Coaching and mentorship on the job  
•  
Personal and career growth  
•  
Teamwork and social aspects of work  
•  
Workflow and processes •  
Passion for the brand  
•  
Diversity and inclusion  
•  
Health and physical well-being  
•  
Emotional and psychological well-being  
Variation exists from organization to organization. Your  
perspective may result in different divisions of these topics to  
highlight what’s most important for the organization at this  
point. For instance, a startup may emphasize brand passion  
and workflow more than a large corporation, which might  
focus on coaching and career development.  
Jacob Morgan, the author of The Employee Experience  
Advantage, offers a practical way to grasp EX as a whole. He  
compartmentalizes the key aspects of employee experience  
into three categories\:  
Cultural environment  
This is the biggest and perhaps most important contrib-  
utor to the employee experience. A range of factors are  
at play here\: a sense of purpose, the perceived value of  
employees in the organization, diversity and inclusion, fair  
treatment, growth and mentorship, well-being, and more.  
Technical environment  
The software and hardware employees use make up the  
technical environment. Availability and consumer-grade  
options are key factors in providing a great employee  
experience, as well as alignment of employee needs and  
business requirements.  
Physical environment  
This refers to where employees work, including in offices  
and remote or at-home work. Flexibility and multiple  
workspace options are key factors when considering the  
physical employment environment. Morgan points to a  
desire to bring friends to work as a sign of a good physi-  
cal environment.  
# Employee experience is how employees  
# live the company culture over time.  
The point is that EX is multifaceted, considering multiple char-  
acteristics simultaneously. The important thing to remember is  
that EX is not just nice-to-have, but an imperative for growth.  
Through rigorous research, Morgan shows that organizations  
that invested most heavily in EX were\:  
•

Over 11 times more likely to appear in Glassdoor’s “Best  
Places to Work” list  
More than four times more likely to feature in LinkedIn’s  
list of North America’s “Most InDemand Employers”  
28 times more often listed among Fast Company’s “Most  
Innovative Companies”  
Listed twice as often by Forbes as one of the “World’s  
Most Innovative Companies”  
Twice as often found in the American Customer  
Satisfaction Index  
Employee Experience 59Additionally, Morgan found that “experiential organizations  
had more than 4 times the average profit and more than 2  
times the average revenue. They were also almost 25 per-  
cent smaller, which suggests higher levels of productivity and  
innovation.”  
This message is not necessarily new. As early as 1998, Joseph  
Pine II and James Gilmore showed that we had entered a new  
era they dubbed the “experience economy.”\* We are evolving  
toward an age of networked enterprises, in which the tra-  
ditional hierarchies of the corporation will be supplanted by  
self-organizing systems collaborating on digital platforms.  
The bottom line is that how a company works is as important  
as what it produces. This includes everything from recruiting  
to org charts to collaboration to culture. With so many factors  
to consider, the concept of experience becomes a unifying  
force. In other words, viewing the customer experience with-  
out considering the employee experience misses half of the  
equation.  
# Mapping the Employee  
# Experience  
Organizations concerned with employee experience don’t  
want to just observe and report on it; they want to active-  
ly shape it. As with any experience, we can map EX as a  
sequence of interactions that unfold over time. Logically, a

­ diagram of the EX is a key first step in facilitating a dialogue  
with an actionable outcome.  
The process for creating a map of the employee experience is  
the same as that for creating a map of the customer expe-  
rience. We can apply all that we know about diagramming  
customer experiences and human experiences to understand-  
ing the end-to-end employee experience.  
After determining who will be on the team that runs the  
mapping process, start the effort by determining the point of  
view, scope, and focus. Decide which employee experience  
to map. Not everyone \(for instance, executive management  
versus individual contributors\) will have the same experience.  
To begin with, define the point of view that is most relevant  
to the problem you are trying to solve.  
But just defining whose experience to map can get com-  
plicated quickly. For instance, you may want to consider  
freelancers and how they fit into the organization as related  
to the employee experience. While it’s tempting to exclude  
external contractors from the scope of your EX map, they in  
turn impact the full-time employee experience. And as the  
gig economy takes off and organizations are more and more  
motivated to scale through freelancers, aligning them to the  
organization becomes critical.  
After defining whose experience to map, scope the experi-  
ence. The map in Figure 3-2 shows an example of an employ-  
ee experience provided by UXPressia, an online mapping tool.  
It’s nearly identical to a customer journey map in form and  
format. In this case, the scope of the diagram is broad—from recruit-  
ing to career development. This high-level view could help  
an organization prioritize which aspects of the overall em-  
ployee experience it might seek to improve first. For example,  
addressing issues during recruiting could have a downstream  
effect on later stages. From this diagram it’s also clear that  
onboarding is a weak spot relative to other phases.  
It’s possible to zoom in and map just one section, such as the  
beginning from searching for a job to completing a trial phase  
of employment. At any point in the overall journey, you can  
drill down further and map the experience in more detail. Be  
sure to get the right level of granularity and scope the effort  
to address your team’s most important questions.

Prepare equipment in advance.  
Appoint a tutor for a few weeks to help  
the new hire with daily tasks.  
Take advantage of different types of  
training.  
Ask the new hire for feedback regularly  
and give him performance feedback as well.  
Discuss the goals you set with the new  
employee and change them if needed.  
When giving the employee feedback on the  
probation period, be completely honest by covering  
both positive and negative things about the hire.  
When informing the employee about  
promotion, mention further career  
opportunities in the same company.  
FIGURE 3-2. An end-to-end experience map shows a broad sequence of touchpoints employees have with an organization, from the job search to career  
management.  
Mapping the Employee Experience 61For example, Chris McGrath created a day-in-the-life map  
of an employee for his digital transformation consultancy,  
Tangowork. The top of the diagram in Figure 3-3 shows the  
employee’s workflow across a single day. The middle includes  
an estimation of common thoughts along with emotional  
highs and lows. At the very bottom in the colored boxes are  
concrete tactics to address the employee’s pain points.  
While such a day-to-day view may only lead to local, tactical  
solutions, mapping at this level becomes part of creating a  
more fulfilling employee experience. Such granular views can  
ladder up to a picture of the overall experience employees  
have.  
FIGURE 3-3. An EX map can take a day-in-the-life format rather than mimicking a customer journey map.  
62 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside FIGURE 3-4. Based on a common template for EX, consultants at XPLANE are able to map different employee experiences consistently using the same  
format for each diagram.  
Mapping the Employee Experience 63Or consider the approach taken by Rafa Vivas, creative direc-  
tor at XPLANE, a leading visual business consultancy, shown  
in Figure 3-4 \(in Spanish\). Their template for an employee  
experience reflects common stages of employment along the  
top, from discovery and onboarding to work, rewards, and  
eventually exit. The rows then illustrate the touchpoints they  
have with internal people, tools, and systems, an estimated  
emotional curve, and needs before concluding with insights  
and opportunities. Overall, this reflects alignment across  
multiple aspects of employment and points to actionable  
outcomes for improvement.  
After defining the cornerstones of the mapping effort, re-  
search the experience with data from existing and prospective  
employees. Follow the steps for the investigation outlined  
in Chapter 6. Then, illustrate the experience as outlined in  
Chapter 7. The aim is to tell a story that  
reflects the insights you gathered from  
the investigation in a way that is clear  
and accessible to others.  
# Align the CX to the EX  
I like to think of the relationship of customers to employees as  
a single ecosystem. How companies provide value to custom-  
ers these days is as important as the offering itself. The key is  
to view employees as endpoints in the value creation process\:  
their experience is as important as the resulting customer  
experience.  
Frontstage employees, such as sales representatives and cus-  
tomer support agents, may have direct contact with custom-  
ers. But even backstage employees, such as product develop-  
ers and HR functions, play a role, too\: they either support the  
people who interface with customers or interact with custom-  
ers through the offering. Everyone in an organization is part  
of the experience.

FIGURE 3-5. View the CX and EX

and employees as equal endpoints,

64 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside Figure 3-5 shows a conceptual model for how the employ-  
ee experience and the customer experience are connected  
through direct and indirect relationships.  
The point is that companies must nec-  
essarily be concerned with developing  
the infrastructure that supports experi-  
ence, both inside and outside the orga-  
nization. To be customer obsessed, you  
also have to be employee obsessed.  
Brand leadership expert Denise Lee Yohn discusses the im-  
portance of this type of alignment. She points out that the  
biggest challenge in becoming a customer-centric company is  
creating a structure that enables customer centricity. Lee Yohn  
discusses CX through the lens of a brand, and relates EX to  
company culture. In her book Fusion she uses the metaphor  
of nuclear fusion, writing\:  
When fused, the two nuclei create something entirely  
new. In the same way, you can unleash great pow-  
er when you fuse together your organization’s two  
nuclei\: your culture—the way people in your organiza-  
tion behave and the attitudes and beliefs that inform  
them \(i.e., “the way we do things around here”\)—and  
your brand or brand identity, how your organization is  
understood by customers and other stakeholders.  
I view the customer experience as the brand in action and the  
employee experience as the company culture in action. In oth-  
er words, if the brand represents a company’s overall posture  
# To be customer obsessed,  
# you also have to be  
# employee obsessed.  
in a market, the customer experience is how people perceive  
it over time while interacting with a company. Likewise, while  
culture is the attitudes and beliefs of a company, the employ-  
ee experience is the timeline of how  
employees live that culture from their  
perspective while on the job.  
Many companies have explicitly made  
the connection between CX and EX  
in the manner that Lee Yohn recom-  
mends. For instance, Southwest Airlines made this explicit in a  
blog post on its company culture\: “Happy Employees=Happy  
Customers=Increased Business/Profits=Happy Shareholders!  
We believe that, if we treat our Employees right, they will  
treat our Customers right, and in turn that results in increased  
business and profits that make everyone happy.”  
Seema Jain, my colleague at MURAL, has taken practical steps  
to align the CX with the EX. Her approach is straightforward\:  
map both in a single overview for a visual alignment of the  
two.  
Figure 3-6 shows a basic template for her approach. At the  
top is a very typical map of a customer journey, in pink. Below  
that, in blue-green, is a space to map the employee experi-  
ence. The aim is to enumerate the key defining elements of  
the CX \(actions, attitudes, and touchpoints\) and correlate  
those to the aspects of the EX that support the experience  
\(processes, team interactions, systems, and tools, as well as  
the employees’ attitudes and feelings\).  
Align the CX to the EX 65In workshops with a range of stakeholders, she’s able to fa-  
cilitate a strategic conversation on how to align the employee  
work to better support the desired outcomes on the customer  
experience side. Read more about her approach and view a  
completed example of the CX/EX alignment template in the  
case study at the end of the chapter.  
It’s no easy task to design a holistic employee experience. Over-  
all, many steps require commitment and perseverance. Some of  
the key considerations are how to build compassionate teams,  
how to manage journeys over time, and how to organize  
around experience—these themes are discussed in the follow-  
ing sections.  
FIGURE 3-6. Using standard mapping techniques, it’s possible to visually align the CX and EX using a simple template.  
66 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside Build Compassionate Teams  
Empathy for customers is a starting point on the path to  
achieving customer centricity, but it’s not enough. The over-  
all system of value creation must allow for compassion, or  
the ability to take action toward creating an ideal customer  
experience.  
For instance, looking at a broad employee journey—from  
before a person comes to a company and throughout their  
career development—you can explicitly consider how employ-  
ees internalize the customer experience and become empow-  
ered to contribute to it. Consider some of these approaches to  
empowering employees to be customer obsessed across the  
employee journey\:  
Recruiting  
Give your prospects a sense of what to expect even  
before they join your organization. Indicate your commit-  
ment to the customer experience up front by signaling  
what type of employee you are looking for. Foreshadow  
your desired CX culture in advance to ensure you get  
the right people. The very first contact people have with  
you—as early as coming across a job description—is part  
of their employee experience and can spark their interest  
in customer obsession.  
Interviewing  
Ask prospects about their impression of the CX of your  
company during their job interview. For instance, you can  
ask about the experience they had interacting with your  
brand for the first time or how they might improve your  
customer experience. This can give insight into how they  
think about CX in general and how they may affect it in  
their role.  
Hiring  
Put language in your offer letters and other documents  
that strongly suggest a commitment to providing a world-  
class customer experience. Reinforce your position about  
CX and the expectations you have of employees and indi-  
cate their responsibilities with regard to CX.  
Onboarding  
As new employees enter the company, show them early  
on how their experience at the company will empower  
them to take action to ensure an ideal customer experi-  
ence. For instance, in his book The Year Without Pants,  
author Scott Berkun discusses his first days working  
at Automattic, the makers of WordPress. Every new  
employee there answers support tickets from customers.  
This not only gives them direct contact with customers,  
but also exposes them to the internal and external sys-  
tems that provide the customer experience.  
Align the CX to the EX 67Empowering work  
Build programs that expose all employees to customer  
insight. For instance, tax software giant Intuit has estab-  
lished a company-wide “follow me home” program  
that gets employees out of the building and observing  
customers at their places of work. In another example,  
Hyatt Hotels encourages employees to be themselves  
rather than using scripted texts when speaking to guests.  
They are encouraged to engage in a more authentic and  
empathic dialogue with customers.  
Career development and growth  
Anchor criteria for promotion and advancement in the  
organization around customer experience. Typically,  
monetary incentives permeate organizations like invisible  
girders, driving behaviors and actions from the top down.  
For instance, executives may have quarterly revenue goals  
that guide their strategies and actions. Instead, consider  
how incentives around the customer experience can  
be a motivating force. Explicitly reward people for their  
advances in creating a better CX through bonuses and  
career advancement.  
# The overall system of value creation  
# must allow for compassion, or the  
# ability to take action toward creating  
# an ideal customer experience.  
68 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside  
Living the brand values  
Design ways for employees to experience brand values  
themselves and to step into the shoes of customers as  
much as possible. For instance, Airbnb directly aligns the  
employee experience to its core brand identity\: “belong  
anywhere.” Their flexible office design allows employees  
to move around and work from different desks and areas.  
They also promote remote working in a way that allows  
employees to collaborate from anywhere in the world.  
The “belong anywhere” workplace—both physical and  
virtual—allows employees to live the brand, reinforcing  
the desired customer experience.  
Of course, mapping helps provide insight into the employee  
experience in several ways. Three ways to leverage mapping  
for an overall improved employee experience are\:  
1\. Workshop the employee experience as a team, internally.  
Creating a map is a great first step to designing a better  
employee experience. But to activate the insights from  
the diagram for management and HR teams, you’ll need  
to bring people together for a united effort. Hold a work-  
shop to review the employee experience together and  
come to an agreement on action steps. You can use many  
of the techniques outlined in Chapter 8 to set up and run  
such a workshop.  
2\. Use maps of the experience to onboard new employees.  
During their initial introduction to the company, review  
existing experience maps with employees. Consider 3\. reserving an entire day or more during onboarding to  
focus on customers and the customer experience. Use a  
map to not only describe the customer experience, but to  
engage new employees in thought exercises around how  
they impact the CX from their position in the company.  
Make mapping a regular exercise to get employees into  
a customer-centric mindset. As I’ve said elsewhere in this  
book, it’s not about the map \(the noun\), it’s about the  
mapping \(a verb\). Involve employees in creating various  
maps regularly, perhaps once a quarter. Make sense of  
the customer experience together, for team building and  
for a rich employee experience \(see Figure 3-7\).  
FIGURE 3-7. Make mapping a team activity at regular intervals for an  
engaging EX that puts people in contact with the customer experience.  
# Organize Around Experience  
In his article “Dysfunctional Products Come from Dysfunction-  
al Organizations,” design leader Jon Kolko points to bureau-  
cracy, siloed functions, and a culture of defensiveness as the  
root causes of product failure. He concludes\:  
If the process, culture, and day-to-day experience of  
the organization is chaotic or broken, we can start to  
predict that our customers are experiencing an equally  
broken product or service. … I’ve observed its validity  
in many products and companies. Of course, there are  
exceptions, but on the whole it seems true that bad  
products point to bad alignment.  
He recommends various activities—all of which can be  
seen as elements of an employee experience—to get teams  
aligned, such as regular team-building events and alignment  
workshops. Visual models, such as experience maps, play a  
particularly large role according to Kolko. More importantly,  
building models of the intended experience together aligns  
the understanding of those creating the customer experience.  
But trainings and workshops aren’t enough. They only superfi-  
cially create an experiential mindset across the organization.  
Aligning teams inside-across for an ideal customer experience  
is a structural issue as well, and broad change management  
may be needed.  
Every company with more than a few employees has silos.  
Journey thinking requires cross-silo organization of work.  
Aligning the functions of your organization to aspects of the  
Align the CX to the EX 69customer journey goes a long way toward creating an employ-  
ee experience that directly supports the customer experience.  
It’s more than just symbolic\: org charts that mirror the CX  
reinforce your commitment to a customer-centric ­ company.  
This raises the question, who owns the customer experience  
of an organization? Ultimately, it’s the responsibility of the en-  
tire company. Teams labeled “Customer Experience” or similar  
are there to connect the dots, not to take the responsibility  
off of others. Their job is to enable and empower everyone in  
an organization to take care of the CX.  
If we agree that “everyone owns the customer experience,”  
or at least “everyone impacts the customer experience,” then

how you organize is critical to providing a desired outcome.  
For instance, a previous client of mine at an ecommerce  
provider once introduced himself as a member of the Discov-  
ery group. He explained their job was to help people find the  
products they offered, regardless of channel or medium. They  
also had teams for Purchasing and Success. In other words,  
their organization mirrored the customer journey, not func-  
tional lines or technology types \(Figure 3-8\).  
Diagrams of the customer journey provide the basis for this  
type of organization. They reveal a model to follow that  
mirrors the individual’s experience, and thus serve as a type  
of blueprint for your organization. This leads to a new way of  
seeing your offerings, which in turn fosters innovation.  
What’s more, aligning to the cus-  
tomer experience can also guide  
goal setting and performance  
reviews. For instance, a team could  
use the phases of the custom-  
er journey to form monthly or  
quarterly OKRs \(objectives and key  
results\), or performance reviews  
could have target outcomes for a  
specific phase, such as increasing  
awareness or improving the find-  
ability of products or services. The  
organizing principle of a customer  
journey can appear throughout  
the organization.  
FIGURE 3-8. Organize teams around the customer experience.  
70 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside If the customer experience matters, then you have to orga-  
nize in a meaningful way to deliver it. For example, take how  
USAA, a financial services and insurance provider to military  
veterans in the US, organized around different “experiences.”  
Rather than focusing on functional capabilities and services,  
as they had previously \(e.g., checking accounts, credit cards,  
auto loans, home loans\), they shifted to more human-cen-  
tered lines of business. Now there’s a “daily spending” owner  
responsible for parts of experiences across checking accounts  
and credit cards.  
In another example, a large publisher I once worked for took  
a similar approach. They first identified four logical divisions  
in their offerings that correlated to experiences they wanted  
to create, and then they organized offering teams around  
those. Though not embedded in the top-level org chart,  
the cross-functional teams came together to align around  
the intended customer experiences. Mapping informed this  
structure initially, which resonated with the market and also  
increased internal collaboration.  
Organizing around experience embeds customer centricity  
at a deep level. This is no easy task, but companies that are  
customer obsessed can make the shift, which ultimately al-  
lows them to outperform competitors. Anchoring experience  
at the foundational level of an organization creates a unique  
employee experience, pointing everyone in the same direction  
toward a better customer experience.  
# Manage Journeys Over Time  
One-off efforts are not enough. Driving customer experi-  
ence through a better employee experience is an ongoing  
endeavor. Managing the customer journey needs to be done  
over time to provide insight into progress and how employee  
efforts measurably impact customers.  
The type of mapping advocated in this book in general  
centers on qualitative model creation and activation within  
teams. The aim is to instill empathy and to agree on opportu-  
nities and action plans moving forward. This is a core step in  
overall customer experience management, but it’s not enough  
to keep momentum toward an improved customer experience  
going.  
Active journey management takes a more dynamic view of  
the experience and brings it alive in the employee experience.  
The aim is to monitor the customer journey using live data as  
it happens and to monitor the CX as it unfolds. This requires  
much more than just mapping an experience—namely, inte-  
grating metrics into the journey, e.g., via a dashboard of some  
type.  
A range of tools and solutions allow for the integration of  
real-time data into a journey model for up-to-date insights  
into actual customer behavior. Current examples of such tools  
include BryterCX by ClickFox, Kitewheel, SuiteCX, Tandem-  
Seven, and Touchpoint Dashboard, to name just a few.  
These tools often have a range of functions, from modeling  
journeys to managing and orchestrating customer experiences  
Align the CX to the EX 71over time. Many of them leverage maplike visualizations to  
help make sense of the analytics.  
For instance, Figure 3-9 shows an example of a dashboard  
that Kitewheel provides showing paths through an online ser-  
vice. Key indicators for the journey are shown at the top, with  
a view of the actual pathways through the website below.  
Journey management is part of the broader field of customer  
experience management, which seeks a controlled monitoring  
of interactions through each touchpoint. The objective is to  
deliver the right experience at the right time. The analysis can  
get quite complex and detailed.  
For instance, the Qualtrics XM suite of tools offers real-time  
journey management capabilities. Figure 3-10 shows just one  
dashboard view from the XM Suite to report on the actual  
customer experience.  
As expected, artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly im-  
portant role in customer experience management. Ultimately,  
AI will allow for greater personalization of customer interac-  
tions. But regardless of the technologies involved, customer  
experience management begins with a deep understanding of  
the customer journey, and in most cases it’s rooted in research  
and visualized through customer journey mapping.  
FIGURE 3-9. An example of a customer  
journey management dashboard by  
Kitewheel, reflecting live data and  
interactions with customers.  
72 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside Keep in mind that to gain a view into the live customer expe-  
rience, inputs from across the organization are needed. CX is  
not a single department’s responsibility, and ongoing journey  
management breaks silos.  
FIGURE 3-10. The Qualtrix XM suite is a powerful collection of tools for  
measuring both the customer experience and the employee experience in  
real time.  
Installing a customer journey management program is a  
strategic endeavor requiring buy-in from teams across the  
organization and commitment from the top of the company.  
Broadly, there are five steps involved in monitoring customer  
journeys over time\:  
1\. Define your vision of the end-to-end customer experi-  
ence. This need not be an elaborate analysis. To keep  
it simple, define and agree on the core pillars of what  
you believe makes a great customer experience for your  
business.  
2\. Segment journeys by persona. Not everyone will have  
the same interactions with your offering. New customers  
are different from existing ones; buyers may be different  
from end users; partners will have a different experience  
than suppliers; and full-time employees are different from  
contractors. Decide on which categories of customers you  
want to track.  
3\. Identify key indicators for your customer experience.  
Defining the business metrics to measure experience is  
challenging. There may be a mix of qualitative and quan-  
titative data points to consider that defy being combined  
into a single measure. Journey analytics is an approach  
to insights and measurement that examines customers’  
behavior not just at individual touchpoints, but along the  
paths they take as they attempt to accomplish their goals  
and tasks.  
Align the CX to the EX 734\. Connect data across channels. To implement journey ana-  
lytics effectively, you’ll need a tech platform to aggregate  
data across multiple channels. Net Promoted Score \(NPS\),  
satisfaction survey results, customer effort scores, and  
usage metrics of many kinds are just some of the inputs  
into active journey management. In some cases, new data  
collection mechanisms may be needed—e.g., new cus-  
tomer surveys.  
5\. Orchestrate toward an ideal customer journey. Use the  
insights from monitoring the customer journey to make  
improvements and innovate the experience. Continue  
learning and improving as you make changes and adjust-  
ments. Journey management in an ongoing endeavor.  
Have no doubt\: designing a system to track the customer  
experience of an existing solution in real time is difficult, with  
many challenges and hurdles along the way. To execute at  
scale, you need the right data, the right governance, and the  
right operational model. You also need the right employees  
and the right employee experience surrounding your effort.  
To better make the CX come alive through the EX, customer  
experience leader and author Kerry Bodine advocates for a  
new role—the journey manager—to actively manage the  
customer experience over time.\* She likens this role to that of  
a product manager, or someone who looks after the offering  
of a company. In this case, the offering is the experience. A  
journey manager is someone who brings together disparate  
\*

https\://kerrybodine.com/product/journey-manager-report.  
Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside  
perspectives in an organization, helping reorient the company  
toward a customer experience imperative.  
Journey management is part science and part art, but has  
been shown to have an impactful ROI. CX management has  
been correlated to bottom-line increases. For instance, the top  
companies in Forrester’s Customer Experience Index™ had  
stronger stock price growth and greater returns than compa-  
nies at the bottom of the list.  
The message is clear\: for companies to capture that com-  
petitive advantage and realize its value they must adopt  
“journey thinking.” When it comes to journey management  
and design, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  
This mindset is driven through an employee experience that  
is aligned to the customer experience and managed as such  
over time. Focusing on CX without a plan to optimize the EX  
misses half of the target.  
# Summary  
The concept of EX is about the overall relationship employ-  
ees have with an organization—the sum of their actions,  
thoughts, and feelings over time. It’s not enough to satisfy  
basic requirements of salary and benefits; these days, orga-  
nizations also have to create a sense of purpose so people  
choose to contribute.  
As with customer experiences, the employee experience can  
be mapped for deeper understanding. Visualizing EX helps an  
organization find key opportunities for improvement. More importantly, mapping helps a company align the CX to the  
EX. If you treat employees right, they will treat customers  
right, and your business will grow. If the customer experience  
is the brand in action, the employee experience is the compa-  
ny culture in action.  
Beyond mapping the EX to help encourage passionate em-  
ployees, organizations can also organize around experience  
by forming teams that align to the customer experience.  
Managing journeys over time and bringing customer insight to  
employees on a regular basis then becomes imperative. Jour-  
ney management tools and techniques help inject customer  
centricity throughout the organization.  
The bottom line is that to be customer obsessed, you also  
have to be employee obsessed.

Align the CX to the EX 75CASE STUDY  
# Aligning CX and EX for Strategy Building  
by Seema Jain  
Customer journey maps begin with the first point of contact,  
through purchase, and continue into a long-term relationship  
with a brand. However, if we focus on just the customer experi-  
ence, we are missing half of the story. What traditional custom-  
er journey maps don’t show is what’s beneath the surface\: the  
massive amounts of employee activity that go into creating a  
customer experience \(see Figure 3-11\).  
Evaluating both the customer and the employee sides provides  
a full picture critical to understanding the breadth and depth of  
the journey.  
Creating robust and effective journey maps requires cross-func-  
tional team input, including from customers. It is often challeng-  
ing to bring together geographically dispersed teams and people,  
but 2020 has spurred a radical and involuntary shift to digital  
interaction—even before the coronavirus became a pandemic.  
At MURAL, we’ve refined an approach of explicitly aligning the  
customer experience to the employee experience to find new  
opportunities. The process has four steps\:  
1\. Map the customer journey.  
Through customer research and surveying, begin by mapping  
step-by-step behavior across the holistic customer journey.  
Evaluate customer actions, key interactions, and what attitude  
or emotion the journey evokes. Understanding and connecting  
with emotion is key to designing experiences that connect and  
resonate with customers.  
2\. Map the employee journey.  
We complete our map by going beneath the surface to under-  
stand the employee’s journey. We expose the internal workings  
of the organization, including the business processes, systems,  
tools, and cross-functional teams that facilitate and support the  
customer’s experience.  
Customer

FIGURE 3-11. The customer  
experience is the tip of the iceberg  
above the employee activity  
necessary to create that experience.  
76 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside Inviting representatives from all customer-facing business functions  
to participate will uncover the day-to-day realities of employee  
functions and groups. When employees are frustrated or experienc-  
ing an issue, it often translates to the customer. It’s critical that we  
uncover these emotions to design experiences that connect with  
our internal teams and people to drive satisfaction, engagement,  
and retention.  
Figure 3-12 shows the visual alignment of the CX to the EX in a  
single diagram. In this case, the experience centers on the first part  
of the onboarding flow into MURAL.

3\. Evaluate the journey map.  
By evaluating customer and employee emotions, we can begin  
to easily identify where moments of truth are occurring—that  
is, pivotal moments in the journey that leave lasting positive or  
negative impressions on customers and employees. This presents  
an opportunity to either fix an issue or capitalize on an opportunity  
to drive loyalty and advocacy.  
Identifying moments of truth allows us to reframe the issue or  
opportunity as exploratory questions using the phrase “how might  
we” \(HMW\). HMW questions create an open space for new ideas  
and encourage us to collaborate with others to find the answers.  
They also keep us from jumping to one solution too quickly, shut-  
ting the door on exploration and innovation.  
4\. ‍Prioritize.  
At this point in our digital workshop, we usually have several HMW  
questions that serve as a springboard for successful ideation. We  
can narrow the focus by inviting participants to vote on the most  
compelling HMW question, reaching a democratic consensus on  
where to start.  
We‍use this approach in strategic workshops with our customers to  
define how we’ll work together for the next several years. Specifi-  
cally, we’re able to identify the key levers on the employee experi-  
ence side that will improve the customer experience.  
78 Chapter 3\: Employee Experience\: Aligning Inside  
For instance, at a recent workshop with a large life insurance com-  
pany, this process revealed several issues in the employee journey  
related to an outsourced call center that was creating negative  
moments of truth in the customer journey. The comprehensive  
CX + EX journey map shone a light on the issues, resulting in the  
necessary buy-in and investment from executives to build internal  
capabilities to support customers through important life events.  
By improving the EX and making operations at that point more  
streamlined and pleasant for everyone involved, we created a lift in  
the CX that ultimately improved customer retention.  
Our customers have said of the process, “I didn’t realize how  
much there is to do internally. Your approach helps us get a strong  
direction on addressing our toughest customer experience chal-  
lenges.” Employee satisfaction is the leading indicator of cus-  
tomer experience—simply put, if your employees are happy and  
engaged, they will create better experiences, which translates to  
­ happier customers.

# Visualizing Strategic Insight  
A number of years ago, I facilitated a multiday strategy work-  
shop at the company I was working for. During dinner the  
director of sales explained his perspective on the workshop’s  
purpose\: “We have to figure out how to get customers for all  
they are worth.” He gestured as if wringing a towel. “If the  
towel gets dry, you have to squeeze harder. A good leader  
knows how to do that, and a good strategy makes it easier.”  
He was serious. I was horrified. Our markets are not people  
“out there” that we shake down for loose change. Customers  
are our most valuable assets, I thought. We should strive to  
learn from them so that we can provide better products and  
services.  
The director’s perspective was shortsighted. He believed the  
sole purpose of our business was getting more sales. That  
may be fine in the short term, but ultimately this narrow per-  
spective leads to failure.  
Companies frequently don’t realize that as a business grows,  
it must also widen its strategic field of vision. I call this misstep  
strategy myopia. It happens time and time again\: organiza-  
tions ultimately don’t know what business they are really in.  
Take Kodak. The film giant dominated the market for over a  
century, but filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Many people believe  
that Kodak failed because it missed out on digital camera  
technology. This is not true. In fact, Kodak invented the first  
digital camera in 1975 and had one of largest holdings of digi-  
tal camera patents.  
Kodak failed because it had the myopic view that it was in  
the film business instead of the storytelling business. Lead-  
ers feared digital technology would cannibalize profits. They  
believed they could protect their existing business through  
marketing and sales. It was nearsightedness in strategy, not  
technology, that led to Kodak’s downfall.  
Successful organizations continuously innovate and expand  
their horizons. Incremental improvements are not enough.  
Technical R&D is not enough. Instead, they grow by question-  
ing the value they create.  
Diagrams of experiences offer a type of insight that is often  
overlooked in strategy creation\: a view from the customer’s  
perspective.  
81This chapter shows how mapping experiences can contribute  
missing strategic insight and ultimately serve as a corrective  
lens for strategy myopia. That was the focus of my workshop  
with the sales director. Together, we started to overcome our  
strategy myopia.  
The chapter concludes with a review of some complementary  
techniques that extend experience mapping in order to better  
visualize strategy. By the end of it, you should get a sense of  
how diagrams broaden your field of vision.  
# A New Way of Seeing  
The context of business has changed over the last few  
decades. Consumers have real power\: they have access to  
prices, product information, and alternative providers around

the world. Traditional approaches to sales—wringing a market  
for what it’s worth—do not work anymore for sustained  
growth.  
Instead, organizations need to reverse their thinking.  
Renowned business leader Ram Charan, for one, urges com-  
panies to invert the traditional sales perspective. In his book  
What the Customer Wants You to Know, he illustrates a flow  
of value insight opposite to traditional approaches \(Figure 4-1\).  
Insight about users is not a nuisance, it’s a strategic oppor-  
tunity. The objective is not a push , it’s a pull . You don’t sell  
products, you buy customers.  
This idea runs contrary to typical strategic decision making,  
but it is not new. As early as 1960, renowned Harvard  
Business professor Theodore Levitt discussed the importance  
of focusing on human needs first. In his influential article  
“Marketing Myopia,”\* Levitt writes\:  
An industry begins with the customer and his needs,  
not with a patent, a raw material, or a selling skill.  
Given the customer’s needs, the industry develops  
backwards, first concerning itself with the physical  
delivery of customer satisfaction. Then it moves back  
further to creating the things by which these satisfac-  
tions are in part achieved.  
\*  
Many of the themes and ideas in this chapter were directly derived from  
Levitt’s landmark article, including the term strategy myopia. The article is still  
relevant and highly recommended. Consider the failure of the railroad industry in the US, a favor-  
ite example of Levitt. During their heyday at the beginning  
of the 20th century, railroads were extremely profitable and  
attractive to Wall Street investors. No one in that business  
could have imagined its demise just a few decades later.  
But railroads didn’t stop growing in the middle of the century  
because of competition from the technologies of cars, trucks,  
planes, and even telephones. They stopped growing because  
they let rivals take their customers. The railroad companies’  
intense focus on their own products led to strategy myopia\:  
they saw themselves as in the railroad business rather than  
the transportation business.  
Though no panacea, mapping  
experiences provides insight that  
helps expand the strategic aper-  
ture. For example, Tim Brown,  
CEO of IDEO, describes his com-  
pany’s work with Amtrak in his  
book Change by Design. His firm was brought in to redesign  
the seats of the Acela trains. The goal was to make the travel  
experience more pleasurable.  
Rather than diving into the seat redesign, however, the team  
first mapped an end-to-end journey around train travel. They  
identified about 12 unique stages in the experience, which led  
to different conclusions about their focus and how to improve  
the travel experience. Brown writes\:  
# Successful organizations  
# continuously innovate and expand  
# their horizons. They grow by  
# questioning the value they create.  
The insight that proved most striking was that passen-  
gers did not take their seats on the train until stage  
eight—most of the experience of train travel, in other  
words, did not involve the train at all. The team rea-  
soned that every one of the prior steps was an oppor-  
tunity to create a positive interaction, opportunities  
that would have been overlooked if they had focused  
only on the design of the seats.  
Alignment diagrams are a type of tool that points to such new  
opportunities. They visually align a description of the individu-  
al’s experience with the offerings of an organization.  
Consider the opportunities high-  
lighted at the bottom of the Rail  
Europe diagram created by Chris  
Risdon that I showed earlier in the  
book \(see Figure 1-5 in Chapter  
1\). Some opportunities suggest  
tactical solutions, but overall they  
go beyond that to point to larger, strategic options. Should  
the company become a provider of travel information? Should  
they integrate with retailers and ecommerce partners? How  
can they reinvent support or the ticketing experience? This  
strategic insight is directly tied to the actual experience of  
train travel and shown in context in the diagram.  
In this sense, alignment diagrams offer a new way of seeing your  
markets, your organization, and your strategy—from the outside  
in rather than from the inside out. Logically, they are most effec-  
tive at the initial stages of providing a service \(Figure 4-2\).  
A New Way of Seeing 83I believe the process of mapping helps correct strategy  
myopia. In my experience, the resulting diagrams invariably  
show a much broader picture of customer needs than a busi-  
ness currently addresses.  
But expanding your strategic field of vision requires change.  
The organization as a whole must adapt to a new mindset. In  
particular, there are three aspects involved\:  
•  
Reframing competition  
•  
Creating shared value  
•  
Reimagining value delivery  
The next sections describe these aspects and how mapping  
experiences can play a role in each.

84 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
# Reframe Competition  
Traditionally, firms categorize customers by demographic or  
psychographic attributes \(age, income, race, marital status,  
etc.\), or they look at purchasing behavior or company size.  
In doing so, managers create categories that don’t match  
their actual customers’ needs and motivations. People typi-  
cally don’t buy products because of their age or income. A  
one-size-fits-all approach inevitably fails, causing managers to  
reshuffle their demographic categories arbitrarily.  
An alternative model sees the market from the customer’s  
perspective. Put simply, people buy products to get a job  
done. The outcomes people seek, not the customers them-  
selves, are the primary dimension for meaningful segmenta-  
tion \(Figure 4-3\).  
Recalling Levitt, Clayton Christensen and coauthors Scott  
Cook and Taddy Hall point to the failure of traditional seg-  
mentation practices. In their article “Marketing Malpractice,”  
they write\:  
The prevailing methods of segmentation that budding  
managers learn in business schools and then practice  
in the marketing departments of good companies are  
actually a key reason that new product innovation has  
become a gamble in which the odds of winning are  
horrifyingly low. There is a better way to think about market segmen-  
tation and new product innovation. The structure of a  
market, seen from the customers’ point of view, is very  
simple\: They just need to get things done, as Ted Levitt  
said. When people find themselves needing to get a  
job done, they essentially hire products to do that job  
for them.  
Shifting your perspective on segmentation reframes the com-  
petition. The job, not the industry or category as defined by  
analysts, determines competition in the mind of the user. You  
don’t compete against products and services in your category\:  
you compete against anything that gets the job done from  
the user’s point of view.  
Desired Outcome 1\:  
e.g., maximize privacy Desired Outcome 3\:  
e.g., ensure reliability

FIGURE 4-3. Typical segmentation focuses on demographic and behavioral dimensions \(left\) instead of desired outcomes \(right\).  
A New Way of Seeing 85For instance, Scott Cook, founder of the tax software giant  
Intuit, once said\:  
The greatest competitor \[in tax software\] … was not  
in the industry. It was the pencil. The pencil is a tough  
and resilient substitute. Yet the entire industry had  
overlooked it.\*  
Think about it\: when you’re preparing a tax return, making  
a quick calculation on a pad of paper is a natural action and  
hard to improve on. Cook knew  
his software not only needed to  
outperform other tax software  
packages, it also needed to  
be more effective than and as  
simple to use as a pencil. Seen this way, tax software com-  
petes with pencils and anything else that gets the job done.  
Diagrams can be used to track alternative means of getting  
a job done. For example, Figure 4-4 is an excerpt from a dia-  
gram detailing the workflow of barristers in Australia. It was  
part of a research effort I led while at LexisNexis, a leading  
provider of legal information. The bottom row shows how we  
mapped different ways of getting work done \(in gray\) to the  
steps in the workflow.  
# Insight about users is not a nuisance,  
# it’s a strategic opportunity.  
After visualizing competing solutions across the entire expe-  
rience, I found barristers were as likely to do legal research  
at libraries or with free online resources as with our flagship  
database. This was eye-opening for stakeholders. The dia-  
grams clearly illustrated how and where our product con-  
tended with different services.  
Business leader Rita Gunther McGrath believes markets should  
be seen in terms of what she calls arenas. Arenas are char-  
acterized by the experiences  
people have and their connec-  
tion to a provider. She writes in  
her bestselling book The End of  
Competitive Advantage\:  
The driver of categorization will in all likelihood be  
the outcomes that particular customers seek \(“jobs to  
be done”\) and the alternative ways those outcomes  
might be met. This is vital because the most substantial  
threats to a given advantage are likely to arise from a  
peripheral or nonobvious location.  
Diagrams of experiences challenge assumptions of who your  
competition really is. They reflect the needs of individuals and  
illustrate the broader experience in which they are relevant.  
This in turn enables you to see the market from the per-  
spective of the customer, not by synthetic segmentation and  
traditional industry categorization.

A New Way of Seeing 87Create Shared Value  
After World War II, US corporations assumed a general  
retain-and-reinvest approach to strategy. They put earnings  
back into the company, benefiting employees and making the  
firm more competitive.  
This gave way to a downsize-and-distribute posture in the  
1970s. Reducing costs and maximizing financial returns, par-  
ticularly for shareholders, became a priority. The widely held  
economic policy belief was that profit is good for society\: the  
more companies can earn, the better off we all are.  
This policy has not made America more prosperous.\* As a  
whole, we are not better off. Since the ’70s, American work-  
ers have been working more and making less. At the same  
time, shareholder value in the form of dividends and CEO  
wages has experienced a massive upturn. As a result, trust in  
corporations is at an all-time low. Businesses are increasingly  
blamed for many social, environmental, and economic prob-  
lems in general.  
The good news is that the balance is changing, and we are  
witnessing a shift from shareholder value to shared value. For  
example, the Business Roundtable, an association made up  
of the CEOs of major US companies, released in 2019 a new  
statement on the purpose of a corporation that moved away  
from serving shareholders only. Signed by nearly two hundred  
\*  
For more on the adverse effects of maximizing shareholder value on society,  
see William Lazonick’s critical article “Profits Without Prosperity,” Harvard  
Business Review \(Sep 2014\).  
88 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
CEOs, the statement described the group’s commitment to  
serving “all stakeholders,” including customers, employees,  
suppliers, and communities.†  
In his landmark article “Creating Shared Value,” strategy  
thought leader Michael Porter recognizes a tipping point in  
business\: no longer can companies operate at the expense of  
the markets they serve. He writes\:  
A big part of the problem lies with companies them-  
selves, which remain trapped in an outdated approach  
to value creation that has emerged over the past few  
decades. They continue to view value creation nar-  
rowly, optimizing short-term financial performance in  
a bubble while missing the most important customer  
needs and ignoring the broader influences that deter-  
mine their longer-term success.  
Shared value directly links revenue to creating social benefit,  
which in turn provides a competitive advantage back to the  
organization. It’s a win-win approach.  
Shared value goes beyond social responsibility. It touches the  
heart of an organization’s strategy. The aim of shared value  
is to make every time a customer interacts with a company  
also create value for society. There are three ways of thinking  
about shared value strategically\:

For example, Skype launched a program called “Skype in  
the Classroom” that enables teachers to collaborate with  
other instructors around the world and design different  
learning experiences for their students. In other words,  
Skype is not only in the videoconferencing business,  
they provide educational collaboration opportunities for  
customers.  
Innovate how products and services are produced.  
In 2009, for example, Intercontinental Hotels Group \(IHG\)  
introduced the GreenEngage program to address the  
group’s environmental footprint. To date, they’ve achieved  
energy savings of about 25%, and IHG differentiates itself  
with this program to customers. In  
other words, IHG is not just a pro-  
vider of hotel rooms, they are in the  
business of creating environmentally  
conscious communities.  
Collaborate with partners in new ways.  
Nestlé, for example, worked closely with dairy farmers in  
India, investing in technology to build competitive milk  
supply systems. These simultaneously generated social  
benefits through improved health care. In other words,  
Nestlé doesn’t just produce food products, they are in the  
nutrition business.

The notion of shared value means that an organization needs  
to conceive its value proposition in a way that takes many per-  
spectives into account. Chief among these is a deep under-  
standing of human needs. For instance, in a video interview  
Porter advises\:  
Figure out what your product is and what your  
value chain is. Understand where those things touch  
important social needs and problems. If you’re in  
financial services, let’s think about “saving” or “buying  
a home”—but in a way that actually works for the  
consumer.  
Now consider Figure 4-5, a diagram of buying a home created  
by Sofia Hussain, a leading digital strategist in Norway. It  
shows the services of a fictitious home-list-  
ings company in the inner circle, labeled  
inside activities. The activities of the user—  
the outside activities—are listed in the  
bigger circle. Also included are touchpoint  
types, illustrated with small icons.  
In her article “Designing Digital Strategies, Part 2,” Hussain  
suggests a strategic scenario for the company\: they want to  
expand their business with services that address more cus-  
tomer needs in this domain. The intent is to move away from  
a business for buying a home and moving to one that helps  
people settle into a new home. This diagram can be used to  
illustrate how that expansion fits into the overall experience  
from the customer’s perspective.  
A New Way of Seeing 89 90 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
FIGURE 4-5. This map created  
by Sofia Hussain illustrates the  
experience of “buying a home.” But shared value goes one step further than increasing ser-  
vices or moving into a playing field. It requires the company to  
ask how it might also create social benefit.  
For example, in this case the company might promote health-  
ier lifestyles by coordinating home listings with information  
about neighborhood walkability . In the map in Figure 4-5,  
services around selecting a neighborhood and finding a new  
home are points of interaction where presenting walkability  
information makes sense—but thanks to the potential cost  
savings, it could also be included in determining what you  
can afford . Perhaps the system could show how much money  
could be saved by reducing gas expenses or getting rid of a  
car altogether.  
With shared value in mind, the strategic aspiration of the  
company becomes even broader\: it’s about more than just  
buying a home or even settling into a home; it’s about creat-  
ing a healthier, environmentally friendly lifestyle when buying  
a new home.  
Diagrams help us think through the interactions and customer  
needs in a holistic way—recalling Porter, they view the offer-  
ing in a way that actually works for the consumer. Finding  
shared business value  
relies on such exam-  
inations of the overall  
human experience,  
and visualizations help  
us find opportunities. Reimagine Value Delivery  
As the size of computer chips gets smaller and smaller, it  
becomes increasingly more feasible to embed processing  
power into common objects. Once fitted with a microcontrol-  
ler, physical products can connect to the internet. Dubbed the  
Internet of Things \(IoT\), the resulting network of smart con-  
nected devices expands the possibilities for delivering value.  
Google’s Nest ecosystem, for example, is one of the most  
extensive smart home services available today \(Figure 4-6\),  
connecting speakers, thermostats, smoke detectors, routers,  
doorbells, cameras, and locks.  
In this environment, the design of any one component  
becomes more challenging. An explicit awareness of the  
broader system must also be considered. A firm grasp of  
this ecosystem comes from visualizing it, not only from a  
device and connectivity standpoint, but from an experiential  
perspective.  
As the lines between physical and digital solution design blur,  
an understanding of how services meet the needs of individ-  
uals is more and more imperative. There’s a progression from  
FIGURE 4-6. The Google Nest ecosystem of connected devices includes a range of options that can be combined and used  
in an infinite number of ways.  
A New Way of Seeing 91individual products to connected solutions to solutions that fit  
into an ecosystem. Part of the value that organizations deliver,  
then, is how their offerings integrate with others \(Figure 4-7\).  
For example, the design consultancy Claro Partners previously  
developed a straightforward approach for mapping the vari-  
ous elements in an IoT system. They created a series of cards  
for the different aspects typically involved. Teams fill out cards  
and then arrange them into a diagram of the ecosystem.  
Figure 4-8 shows an example of the resulting map, in this case  
for the Nike FuelBand. It reveals important interdependencies  
in the experience, such as a relationship between FuelBand  
users as well as a connection between physical devices, soft-  
ware, and data services.  
IoT doesn’t just make it harder to conceive and design new  
products. It fundamentally changes strategy. Your service will  
inevitably be part of a system of services. Diagrams help you  
understand the complexities and interrelationships involved.  
Success is determined by how well services fit with one another  
and, more importantly, how well they fit into people’s lives.

A New Way of Seeing 93Mapping Strategy  
Strategy is typically created behind closed doors at the top  
levels of an organization. Leaders then reveal the strategy to  
the rest of the organization, usually as a PowerPoint presen-  
tation, and employees are expected to “get it” and somehow  
be able to magically align their work to the strategy.  
But when things go wrong later on, these same leaders blame  
the failure on poor execution. They overlook the fact that  
strategy and execution are related\: a brilliant strategy that  
can’t be implemented isn’t brilliant.  
Poor communication is only part of the problem. How strat-  
egy gets created also matters. The process must overcome  
gaps in understanding across the entire organization. Other-  
wise, the realization of strategic intent has no chance.  
Business consultant and author Nilofer Merchant has observed  
a disconnect between the top and bottom layers in many  
organizations. She describes it as an “Air Sandwich” in her  
book The New How. Merchant explains\:  
An Air Sandwich is, in effect, a strategy that has a  
clear vision and future direction on the top layer, day-  
to-day action on the bottom, and virtually nothing  
in the middle—no meaty key decisions that connect  
the two layers, no rich chewy center filling to align  
the new direction with the new actions within the  
company.  
94 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
To address the Air Sandwich, companies should view strategy  
creation as an inclusive endeavor. But the traditional tools  
of strategy creation only confound the situation. Words are  
abstract and open to interpretation. Documents bewilder  
and confuse. Emails and communications are unintelligible by  
those who must implement a strategy.  
Diagrams are an antidote. They open up strategy for broader  
involvement across an organization and increase general  
comprehension.  
The next sections describe several tools that complement  
alignment diagrams. They all seek to visualize strategy or parts  
of it. These include strategy maps, the strategy canvas, the  
strategy blueprint, and the business model canvas and value  
proposition canvas. Diagrams of experiences plug in to these  
techniques, informing customer-related aspects.  
# Strategy Map  
A strategy map represents an organization’s entire strategy  
on a single sheet of paper. The technique was made popular  
by veteran business consultants Robert Kaplan and David  
Norton in their book Strategy Maps. This approach emerged  
from research and years of experience consulting with client  
companies and is part of their earlier framework called the  
balanced scorecard .  
Figure 4-9 shows an example of a generic strategy map.

96 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight Learning and growth of employees  
This perspective outlines the knowledge, skills, and sys-  
tems that the organization needs in order to deliver the  
intended value.  
Internal processes  
Goals at this level reflect the capabilities and efficiencies  
of the organization as a whole.  
Customers  
This perspective represents the value proposition. Here,  
alignment diagrams reveal what customers actually per-  
ceive as valuable.  
Financials  
These are the top-level objectives centered on the value  
captured by the organization in terms of financial gains.  
The resulting map is more than just a list of goals. The map  
connects the objectives to show cau-  
sality. From this standpoint, strategy  
is a series of IF-THEN statements, as  
Kaplan and Norton point out.  
Consider a simple example strategy  
map for Patagonia \(in Figure 4-10\),  
created by Michael Ensley, a business  
consultant with PureStone Partners. Environmental goodwill is  
a key strategic objective prominent in the diagram. Anchoring  
it here makes it visible to everyone else in the organization.  
# Diagrams open up strategy for  
# broader involvement across  
# an organization and increase  
# general comprehension.  
The center of this example shows how Patagonia intends to  
create customer value. A key internal process is indicated as  
solve their \(i.e., customer\) problems, which is linked to two  
aspects\: provide extreme gear and protect our clients. Align-  
ment diagrams foster the types of conversations needed to  
arrive at these problems to solve.  
Strategy maps provide a balanced view of the interlocking set  
of strategic choices an organization makes. They illustrate the  
relationships in objectives and allow others to see how their  
activities fit into the strategic whole.  
# Strategy Canvas  
The strategy canvas is a visual tool to both diagnose existing  
strategies and build alternative ones. It was developed by W.  
Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne around 2000 and featured  
in their groundbreaking book Blue Ocean Strategy . Figure 4-11  
shows an example strategy canvas for Southwest Airlines.  
Across the bottom are the primary  
factors of competition. These are  
aspects that create value for custom-  
ers and the dimensions along which  
firms compete. The vertical axis  
indicates relative performance for  
each factor, from low to high. This  
arrangement reveals a picture of how several organizations  
create value compared to one another.  
A strategy canvas reflects the key dynamic in the blue ocean  
strategy approach. Red oceans, Kim and Mauborgne explain,  
Mapping Strategy 97represent fierce competition among existing industries in a  
given domain. As the space gets crowded, market share for  
each organization dwindles, and the waters become bloody.  
Blue oceans represent uncontested market space. Demand is  
created rather than fought over. Their advice is clear\: don’t  
directly compete with rivals. Instead, make them irrelevant.  
To do this you must make hard tradeoffs. Southwest chooses  
not to compete along the traditional factors of airline ser-  
vice. Instead, it focuses on frequent departures from smaller  
airports. In doing so, Southwest competes with car travel\:  
customers who might otherwise have driven between two  
cities may now consider flying with Southwest instead.

98 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
The process for creating a strategy canvas involves the follow-  
ing steps\:  
1\. Determine factors of value creation. It may be easy to  
come up with dozens of potential factors. The key is to  
focus on the most important ones. This is where align-  
ment diagrams come in\: they help identify these factors.  
They show what problems the organization has and how  
value is perceived from its perspective.  
2\. Determine competitor types. The trick is to select a lim-  
ited set of representative competitors. Three is ideal.  
Including more than four competitors reduces the impact  
of the resulting diagram greatly.

FIGURE 4-12. An example of an experience-based strategy canvas  
comparing types of experiences. 3\. Rate performance for each factor. Typically this is esti-  
mated on a relative scale of low to high. It’s also possible  
to get empirical evidence for each rating, such as through  
a survey.  
An alternative approach to determining the factors of value  
creation is to focus on types of experiences individuals have.  
For instance, from a customer journey map you may have  
identified half a dozen or so phases of interaction \(e.g.,  
becoming aware, purchasing, initiating the service,  
using the service, extending and renewing, and getting  
support\). For each you can evaluate how competing  
services perform, comparing your solution to your  
main competitor’s and others \(see Figure 4-12\).  
This approach may not help you find a blue ocean  
per se, but provides valuable insight and an experi-  
ence-based view of the strategic landscape.  
It’s also possible to use the strategy canvas to compare  
the capabilities of specific solutions. For instance, while  
previously working for a content provider, my team  
wanted to understand why people preferred print  
resources over digital resources. After interviewing  
dozens of customers, we found a set of needs that  
reflected the difference.  
On a graph, shown in Figure 4-13, we showed how  
the solutions compared in terms of meeting or not  
meeting each need. We then hypothesized about  
what would need to be true for people to use our online  
content solutions—labeled “New Online Experience” in the  
diagram—more.  
From this visualization, it became clear to the team what  
to focus on. People in our market needed to annotate doc-  
uments and compare sources, and they needed help with  
navigating that was better than what current online content  
solutions were offering.

Mapping Strategy 99Strategy Blueprint  
Strategy is difficult to define precisely. On the one hand, it  
gets confused with analysis. This includes everything from  
market size to technical assessments to financial prognosis.  
The result is often reports that fill up dozens of pages.  
On the other hand, strategy gets conflated with planning.  
You’ve probably witnessed annual strategy retreats in your  
organization, where leaders spend several days forging plans  
for the upcoming year. They then emerge from seclusion with  
detailed roadmaps and financial plans that quickly become  
obsolete.  
Analysis and planning, while necessary inputs and outputs  
in the strategy creation process, are not the core of strategy.  
You can’t analyze your way to strategy—the answers don’t  
magically emerge from data—and detailed roadmaps don’t  
provide the rationale for the activity they organize. Strategy  
does \(see Figure 4-14\).  
Analysis

Planning  
FIGURE 4-14. Strategy

100 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
Strategy is about devising the optimal way to overcome chal-  
lenges to reach a desired position. It is a creative endeavor,  
not based on analysis and planning alone. Strategy represents  
the logic that connects analysis and planning. Ultimately, it’s  
how your organization makes sense of its actions and deci-  
sions over time.  
I developed the strategy blueprint as a tool to visualize this  
central strategic rationale.\* It uses a canvas format to help  
visualize the relationships between elements of the strategy.  
Figure 4-15 shows an example of a completed strategy  
blueprint. In this case, it reflects the strategy of a fictitious  
company\: Einstein Media Company, a publisher of scientific  
journals, books, and information. The company has led the  
industry for nearly one hundred years, and scientists around  
the world trust its brand name.  
The elements in the strategy blueprint are based on research  
in the field. First, it borrows from Henry Mintzberg’s “five  
Ps of strategy,” introduced in 1987† and later elaborated  
on in the book Strategy Safari . These are combined with  
Roger Martin and A.G. Lafley’s “five questions of strategy”  
from their book Playing to Win. \(Both books are highly  
recommended.\)

Mapping Strategy 101Table 4-1 summarizes and aligns these two existing frame-  
works. The last column reveals their thematic intersection,  
yielding six common elements of strategy. Each element is  
given a box in the blueprint. They are\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Challenges. Strategy implies the need for change, a desire  
to move from point A to point B. What are the hurdles to  
doing so? What opposing forces must you overcome to  
be able to reach your goals?  
Aspirations. What kind of organization do you aspire to  
be? What do you want for your customers and for society?  
Focus areas. Setting a scope for your strategy helps you  
concentrate effort on the things that matter most. Who  
will you serve? What regions will you play in? Which jobs  
to be done will you target?  
Guiding principles. These are the pillars of the strategy  
that you believe will enable you to overcome the chal-  
lenges you face. What mantras will unite teams and unify  
decision making?  
Activities. What types of activities are  
needed to implement the strategy and  
achieve your aspirations? Note that  
this is not about making a roadmap or  
plans, but rather identifying the skills  
and capabilities you’ll ultimately need.  
Outcomes. How will you know your  
strategy is on track? How can you  
show progress and success?  
Building strategy is a creative endeavor. The strategy blueprint  
allows you to explore options with no initial risk. Try alterna-  
tives, cross items off, rework ideas, and start over again. The  
blueprint helps you design your strategy. Use it in briefings, in  
workshops, or as a reference document.  
There is no prescribed order for completing the blueprint. Typi-  
cally, it’s best to start with the challenges and aspirations. After  
that you may find yourself moving freely between the boxes.  
You can do this individually at first and then aggregate the  
results in a master version of the blueprint, or you can work on  
one copy of the blueprint at the same time collectively.  
The blueprint helps you see all the moving parts of strategy at  
once, making it tangible and inclusive to others. I recommend  
creating a simple one- or two-page document that outlines  
the main the points you generated during the exercise to cap-  
ture the strategy in words and in a format that can be easily  
shared with others.

102 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight Business Model Canvas  
The business model canvas is a strategic management tool  
that helps business owners and stakeholders discover different  
business models. Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur  
first introduced it in their book Business Model Generation. It  
has become very popular since then.  
The nine boxes of the canvas represent the key components  
of a business model \(Figure  
4-16\). There is logic to their  
arrangement. The boxes  
on the right represent mar-  
ket-facing aspects, called the  
front stage. On the left are  
the backstage elements of a  
business model—the internal  
business processes. The visual  
format of a canvas promotes  
exploration. You can quickly  
try out alternative models  
and evaluate them before  
making a commitment in any  
one direction. It allows you  
to apply creativity to business  
decisions.  
Figure 4-17 shows a visualiza-  
tion of the business model for  
the silicon provider Xiameter  
compared to its parent com-  
pany, Dow Corning. It is based on the article “Dow Corning’s  
Big Pricing Gamble,” by Loren Gary. The green notes repre-  
sent Dow Corning’s core business. The orange notes show the  
Xiameter model. Interestingly, Xiameter seems to have had an  
effect on the core business model, according to the article.  
These aspects are shown in blue notes.

104 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight Figure 4-18 shows a photo of a canvas I completed with  
stakeholders after an ideation session. Using sticky notes, we  
were able to move information around as needed and con-  
sider any possible alternatives. This allowed us to test assump-  
tions about a new concept from a standpoint of business  
viability.  
Working with the business model canvas takes some practice.  
You have to be able to recognize different types of informa-  
tion quickly and sort them into their respective boxes. Once  
you get the hang of it, you can use the canvas to quickly  
discover alternatives. There are many resources online to learn  
more about this useful tool.  
Value proposition canvas  
The basic grid structure of the business model canvas inspired  
the development of similar tools. One such example is the  
value proposition canvas \(see Figure 4-19\), also created by  
Alexander Osterwalder. It is directly related to the business  
model canvas and plugs into two business model elements\:  
the customer segments you wish to create value for and the  
value proposition you believe will attract customers.  
The value proposition canvas allows you to design and test  
the fit between what you offer and what customers want.  
There are two parts. On the right is the customer profile, with  
three components\:  
•  
Jobs to be done. These are the important issues people  
want solved and the needs they are trying to satisfy.  
•  
Pains. These are the barriers, hurdles, and annoyances  
people have in trying to get a job done. This includes neg-  
ative emotions and risks they may encounter.  
•  
Gains. These are positive outcomes or benefits the indi-  
vidual desires.  
# Building strategy is a  
# creative endeavor.  
FIGURE 4-18. The business model canvas is well suited for using sticky  
notes to explore options.  
Mapping Strategy 105The other half of the canvas, on the left side, details the three  
features of your value proposition\:  
•  
•  
•  
Products and services. These represent your offering,  
including the features and support you provide.  
Pain relievers. This is a description of how your offering  
will alleviate the customer’s pains. These show which  
problems you’re addressing.  
Gain creators. These make explicit how your products and  
services benefit customers.  
By mapping the left side to the right side, you can make  
explicit how you are creating value for your customers. When  
the pain relievers and gain creators correlate to the pains and  
gains of customers, you have a potential strong fit. Validate  
your assumptions with your markets once you have formed a  
clear position.

Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight Summary  
As organizations mature, they often develop strategy myo-  
pia—a failure to see the broader landscape of their business  
and how they can continue to create meaningful value—  
unless they actively fight against it. Successful enterprises  
start with insights about customer needs and work backward  
to their strategy. This reverses many existing practices in  
businesses that seek to push products and services through  
traditional sales channels.  
To change, organizations need to consider additional sources  
of insight that are often left out of strategy creation. This  
includes a deep understanding of how customers perceive  
value. Visualizations of various kinds broaden your field of  
vision and offer a new way of seeing.  
First, consider how to reframe competition. In the eyes of your  
customer, anything that gets the job done is your rival.  
Also consider how you contribute back to society and create  
shared value. Shared value is about creating societal benefits  
with every customer interaction, going far beyond corporate  
social responsibility.  
The Internet of Things forces us to reimagine value delivery .  
Connected smart products inevitably become part of a larger  
ecosystem. The value you create is delivered and experienced  
as part of that context.  
Finally, organize to innovate. First, separate protecting existing  
value from creating new value by setting up different divisions  
in the organization. Then, organize teams to align with the  
customer experience.  
Visualizations tend to open up strategy, making it not only  
more understandable but also more inclusive across the orga-  
nization. Several techniques help illustrate strategy graphically.  
These include strategy maps, strategy canvases, the strategy  
blueprint, and the business model canvas and value proposi-  
tion canvas. These tools complement and extend alignment  
diagrams.

108 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight Identifying Opportunities—Combining Mental Model  
# ­ Diagrams and Jobs to Be Done  
by Jim Kalbach, with Jen Padilla, Elizabeth Thapliyal, and Ryan Kasper  
# CASE STUDY  
A key challenge in product development is selecting areas of  
improvement and innovation to focus on. A solid theory is  
needed to connect user insights to development decisions.  
To that end, the GoToMeeting user experience design team at  
Citrix embarked on efforts to provide actionable needs-based  
insight for product development. The approach combined map-  
ping out user behaviors and motivations through a mental model  
diagram and prioritizing the users’ needs using the “jobs to be  
done” theory. This provided a visual map of the landscape as well  
as directions on how to create value for their customers.  
The overall process had six steps\:  
1\. Conduct primary research.  
We started with contextual inquiry. Broadly looking at the  
domain of work collaboration and communication, we con-  
ducted over 40 on-site interviews. Stakeholders and team  
members were included in the interviewing process.  
Data collection included field notes, photos, audio recordings,  
and video. A third-party vendor transcribed over 68 hours of  
audio recordings. This resulted in nearly 1,500 pages of text.  
2\. Create a mental model diagram.  
Following Indi Young’s approach closely, we analyzed the transcrip-  
tions for the jobs people were trying to get done. Through an iter-  
ative process of grouping, we created the mental model diagram.  
This is a bottom-up approach that entails clustering individual find-  
ings into themes, which are in turn grouped into categories.  
Fundamental goals and needs began to emerge. The result was an  
illustration of “work collaboration” based directly on field research.  
FIGURE 4-20. Using a mental model diagram in a workshop with  
stakeholders. \(The author is pictured with expert UX researcher Amber Braden.\)  
Case Study\: Identifying Opportunities—Combining Mental Model ­ Diagrams and Jobs to Be Done 109CASE STUDY  
The process also included the mapping of current products and  
features that support customer goals and needs. This allowed the  
team to see how our current offerings fit into a customer’s mental  
model.  
3\. Hold a workshop.  
In a workshop with a dozen stakeholders from various depart-  
ments, we read through the diagram in breakout groups. Each  
group got about a third of the overall mental model to work with.  
The goal was to have stakeholders first empathize with the current  
user experience \(Figure 4-20\).  
We then brainstormed concepts using scenarios around the “future  
of work.” To do this, we presented each group with key trends  
about the future of work taken from industry reports. At each sec-  
tion of the diagram, we posed the question to the group, “If each  
trend were to come true, what must we do to support customers  
and ultimately to evolve as a company?”  
To help socialize the outcomes of the workshop, we created an  
infographic summarizing the main conclusions. We printed this  
graphic on a single sheet of paper, had it laminated, and sent it by  
regular mail to workshop participants. A year or more later, it was  
still possible to see this infographic on teammates’ desks.  
4\. Map the concepts to the diagram.  
After the workshop, we updated the diagram with comments and  
input from stakeholders. We then mapped various concepts back to  
the diagram below the support towers. This resulted in an extended  
map and composite picture\: the user’s experience on the top, the  
support we currently offer in the middle, and future enhancements  
and innovations at the bottom \(Figure 4-23\).  
110 Chapter 4\: Visualizing Strategic Insight  
But which gaps in people’s ability to collaborate should we aim to  
solve first? Jobs to be done then helped us focus on the concepts  
with the most potential.  
5\. Prioritize jobs to be done.  
We prioritized the jobs represented in the diagram by two factors\:  
– The level of importance associated with getting the job  
done  
– The level of satisfaction associated with getting the job  
done  
Graphed on a chart, the jobs that are highly important but least  
satisfied have the highest chance of customer adoption \(Figure  
4-21\). They fulfill an unmet need.  
High  
Unmet needs =  
Opportunity  
Importance  
Low  
Low  
High  
Satisfaction  
FIGURE 4-21. Solutions that meet unmet needs—or jobs that are  
important but unsatisfied—have a higher chance of succeeding. To find this sweet spot, we employed a specific technique developed  
by Tony Ulwick. For more on this method, see Ulwick’s writings, listed  
in the “Further Reading” section at the end of this case study.  
The technique starts with generating so-called desired outcome  
statements, or the success measures for completing a job success-  
fully. These were based directly on the mental model diagram.  
Next, we launched a quantitative survey with the complete set  
of about 30 desired outcome statements. Respondents were  
asked to rate each desired outcome statement for both impor-  
tance and satisfaction.  
We then calculated the opportunity score for each statement. We  
determined this by taking the score for importance and adding  
the satisfaction gap, which is importance minus satisfaction. For  
instance, if for a given statement respondents rated importance at  
9 and satisfaction at 3, the result for the opportunity score would  
be 15 \(9 + \(9 – 3\) = 15\). See Figure 4-22.  
Importance  
Satisfaction  
9  
Satisfaction  
Gap  
6  
3  
Note that this score intentionally focuses on customer opportu-  
nity, not financial opportunity or market size opportunity. In other  
words, we were looking to solve for customer needs that would  
maximize the chances of adoption by customers.  
6\. Focus innovation efforts.  
The tasks in the mental model diagram, the opportunity scores, and  
proposed concepts were visually aligned, providing a clear picture  
of the opportunity space \(Figure 4-23\).  
Efforts were prioritized against this information. This gave the team  
confidence that we were moving in the right direction—one that  
was firmly grounded in primary insights.  
Product managers, marketing managers, and engineers found the  
information useful to their work. The prioritized list of people’s  
needs turned out to be a highly consumable format for teams to  
engage with the research. One product owner said\: “It’s great to  
have this data to help make informed decisions. I’m looking for-  
ward to incorporating it more and more.”  
Through these efforts multiple concepts have been prototyped,  
and two innovations are being launched in the Apple Store, along  
with several patent submissions. Overall, the approach gives a rich,  
user-centered theory for service development. The combination  
of the mental model and “jobs to be done” methods has served  
as a centerpiece in the process, fostering many conversations and  
gathering consensus.  
Importance + Satisfaction Gap = Opportunity Score  
9 + 6 = 15

# A General Process for Mapping  
A general process for experience mapping consists of four  
iterative modes of activity\:  
1\. Initiate\: Chapter 5 deals with the details of setting up a  
mapping initiative.  
2\. Investigate\: Alignment diagrams must be grounded in evi-  
dence. Techniques for research are detailed in Chapter 6.  
3\. Illustrate\: Visually representing how value is exchanged  
between an individual and an organization is a core  
aspect of alignment mapping. Chapter 7 covers aspects  
of illustrating a diagram.  
4\. Align and envision\: Chapter 8 shows ways to use dia-  
grams in an alignment workshop, which includes propos-  
ing concepts for testing and future development.  
The preceding process results in current state maps\: depic-  
tions of experiences as you observe them today. The aim is to  
get agreement on how your team understands the experience  
and what problems are worth solving. Once a direction is  
decided upon, use mapping techniques to design solutions  
and test your assumptions with planned experiments, dis-  
cussed in Chapter 9.  
Remember\: it’s not about the map \(noun\), but rather the  
mapping \(verb\). Be sure to involve stakeholders and team  
members throughout the process, at all stages. Get their  
feedback on your initial proposal, include them in the inves-  
tigation, create the diagram together, and come together for  
a workshop at the end of the effort. Don’t make mapping a  
solitary effort. “The secret of getting ahead is getting started.  
# The secret of getting started is breaking  
# your complex overwhelming tasks into small  
# manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”

# Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project  
One of the most common questions I get in my workshops  
on mapping is, “How do I begin?” Aspiring mapmakers may  
see the immediate value in these techniques, yet they have  
barriers to getting started.  
Getting stakeholder buy-in is a common challenge. I’ve been  
fortunate to have had opportunities to create diagrams of all  
kinds and have found that stakeholders typically see the value  
in mapping only after the process is complete. As a result,  
initiating an effort requires convincing them up front.  
What’s more, a mismatch of expectations early on can lead  
to problems later. It’s therefore crucial to frame your intent  
clearly from the outset, particularly when multiple stakehold-  
ers are involved. With the range of possibilities, it’s up to you  
to define your mapping effort appropriately. Some key points  
to keep in mind are\:  
Include others in the process.  
The mapmaker has different roles throughout the effort\:  
researcher, interpreter, and facilitator. It’s critical to get  
participation from others at all points in the process.  
Remember\: the objective is not just to create a diagram,  
but to engage others in conversations and develop solu-  
tions together as a team.  
Consider both current and future states.  
This book focuses on creating what can be described as  
current state diagrams\: visualizations of existing experi-  
ences. Envisioned future products, services, and solutions  
are generally seen as an added layer to these diagrams. I  
believe it is important to see both at once\: cause and cure  
visible simultaneously. Some complementary techniques  
that can help flesh out envisioned future experiences are  
discussed in Chapter 9.  
119Realize you can’t control everything.  
Strive for coherency across the entire experience, but also  
understand that you won’t be able to design every touch-  
point. There may be interactions you can’t or choose not  
to control. Also be sure to set expectations around your  
particular scope and what won’t be included. Still, an  
awareness of the interdependencies across actors and  
touchpoints should inform your strategic decisions.  
You start a mapping project as you would any other effort\:  
by determining the goals, scope, costs, and time frame, and  
making them explicit. This exercise need not be lengthy or  
time-consuming—it may only take a single meeting. But get-  
ting off on the right foot increases your chances of success.  
This chapter details some of the pitfalls I’ve encountered and  
lessons I’ve learned when initiating mapping projects. By the  
end, you’ll know what key questions to ask up front and how  
to get a mapping effort off the ground.  
# Start a New Project  
With increasing frequency, managers and clients are directly  
requesting artifacts such as customer journey maps or experi-  
ence maps by name. This makes getting started easier.  
Without an educated audience, however, initiating a mapping  
effort can prove difficult. Stakeholders may not be immedi-  
ately aware of the benefits of mapping. It provides a type of  
insight that organizations can benefit from greatly, but they  
often don’t know this until they go through the process.  
120 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project  
Before embarking on a project, first determine the level of  
formality, then convince the decision makers to get started.  
# Determine the Level of Formality  
Every team can benefit from mapping in some form, whether  
sketching by hand or working with detailed diagrams. The  
scope of the effort can vary greatly. Determine the level of  
formality that’s most appropriate before beginning.  
This book describes a formal approach to mapping. In some  
cases, such as that of an external consultant working with  
a large organization, a rigorous approach makes sense. In  
Experiences  
FORMAL  
Organization  
Team  
Individual  
User  
Interface  
INFORMAL  
Product  
Ecosystems  
FIGURE 5-1. The need for models increases when entire organizations  
design experiences for ecosystems. other situations, a full-blown process may be inappropriate.  
For instance, when you’re working in a startup, an informal  
approach is fine.  
The formality of a mapping effort can be seen along three  
dimensions, shown in Figure 5-1.\* The horizontal axis ranges  
from producing a single product to providing service ecosys-  
tems. The vertical axis indicates movement from the design  
of a discrete interface to the design of holistic experiences.  
The third dimension, in the middle of the graph, shows an  
increase in the group size.  
Efforts tend to become more  
formal as you move up and  
to the right in this chart. For  
instance, a designer working  
alone on a single product  
may not need a formal  
diagram. But a large team  
dealing with an entire ser-  
vice ecosystem likely would.  
Consider where your project falls on this chart.  
The important point is to consider the appropriate level of for-  
mality before beginning. This will determine how much effort  
you put into each of the phases outlined in this book. Only do  
as much work as needed.  
# Convince Decision Makers  
Once you determine the level of formality you need, con-  
vince decision makers to back your effort. Internal employees  
typically encounter different hurdles than external consultants.  
The former need to persuade; the latter need to sell.  
Though your relationship to stakeholders may vary, many of  
the arguments are the same. To be able to convince decision  
makers, you have to know the objections, provide evidence,  
find a champion, and run a pilot to demonstrate the value.  
Also, create a pitch that you can recite at will.  
# Remember\: the objective is not just  
# to create a diagram, but to engage  
# others in conversations and develop  
# solutions together as a team.  
Know the objections  
If you get pushback, be  
ready with persuasive  
arguments. Table 5-1 lists  
some typical objections, the  
underlying assumptions, and  
potential counterpoints to  
make for each. Try creating a similar table for yourself based  
on the specific pushback you’re getting from stakeholders to  
work through the argumentation.  
\*  
This diagram is adapted from Hugh Dubberly’s video talk “A System Perspec-  
tive on Design Practice.”  
Provide evidence  
Know the benefits of alignment diagrams, outlined in Chapter  
1\. But also be able to provide convincing evidence to support  
your effort. For instance, find examples and case studies in  
the literature. Be able to point to those examples and inte-  
grate them into your discussion.  
Start a New Project 121TABLE 5-1. Typical objections that may be raised before you get started, the assumptions behind them, and arguments you can make against them.  
Assumption Argument  
Objection We don’t have time or budget. Creating diagrams takes  
too long and is expensive.  
Mapping needn’t be expensive or time-consuming. Even a formal project  
can be done in a few weeks for about the cost of a usability test or mar-  
keting survey.  
Each department has its own  
process map.  
Functional silos work effi-  
ciently individually.  
Fine. But do they show interaction across channels and touchpoints? Great  
customer experiences cross our department lines.  
We already know all of this. Implicit knowledge is  
enough.  
Great—then we’re off to a good start. But by making that knowledge  
explicit we can keep the conversations going. Also, we don’t lose insight  
when someone leaves. And if someone new joins the team, we can ramp  
them up quickly.  
I was in that target group. Just  
ask me what’s valuable.  
Customers are viewed  
from an inside-out per-  
spective rather than  
outside-in.  
Your input will be invaluable to get an initial hypothesis. We want to sup-  
plement that with a grounded external perspective as well. That’s where  
the best insights for growth and innovation are found.  
Marketing already does  
research.  
Marketing and experience  
research are the same.  
That’s a good thing, but not enough. We need to uncover unmet needs  
and unexpressed feelings and show them in the context of the overall  
experience.  
One good source is Forrester Research, a leading technology  
industry research company that has been writing full reports  
on the benefits of customer journey mapping in particular. Lo-  
cate their studies or similar reports that show strong evidence  
in favor of mapping.  
Evidence of the return on investment is even more compel-  
ling. For instance, Alex Rawson and colleagues show concrete  
increases in revenue when companies design experiences end-  
to-end rather than optimizing individual touchpoints. In their  
article “The Truth About Customer Experience,” they write\:  
Companies that excel in delivering journeys tend to  
win in the market. In two industries we’ve studied,  
insurance and pay TV, better performance on journeys  
corresponds to faster revenue growth\: In measure-  
ments of customer satisfaction with the firms’ most  
important journeys, performing one point better than  
peer companies on a 10-point scale corresponds to at  
least a two-percentage-point outperformance on reve-  
nue growth rate.  
122 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project Mapping customer journeys, the authors conclude, provides  
the insight for the design of better experiences. This in turn  
contributes to revenue growth.  
Finally, if possible, find out what competitors are doing.  
Search for competitors’ names along with keywords like  
“customer journey map” or “experience map.” Showing that  
others are doing this kind of work goes a long way toward  
convincing decision makers.  
Find a champion  
Identify stakeholders who might best champion a mapping  
effort. The more influential, the better.  
For external consultants, this may be a client with whom you  
have a longer, ongoing relationship. Internal employees need  
to know how to navigate decision making in their organiza-  
tion. In both cases a quick stakeholder analysis may help.  
Run a pilot effort  
If possible, run a small pilot project. Diagrams need not be  
complex or detailed to be effective.  
Alternatively, try creating a diagram as part of another effort.  
For instance, if you are running a traditional usability test, add  
simple follow-up questions to elicit the steps in a given pro-  
cess. Map these together in a draft version of an experience  
map, and use that as a discussion point. Demonstrating value  
with firsthand results is often the most persuasive argument.  
Create a pitch  
Finally, create a succinct statement that you can readily recite.  
Include the business problems you’ll address. Why should a  
decision maker invest in a mapping effort of any kind? Here’s  
an example pitch\:  
You’d like to grow beyond your current offerings. By  
mapping the entire experience, you can quickly gain  
a better understanding of the needs and emotions of  
new markets and segments.  
Mapping is a modern technique to improve customer  
understanding that more and more companies are  
using, such as Intel and Microsoft.  
By visually aligning various aspects of the customer ex-  
perience with business processes, you’ll be able to see  
how to best create and capture value across channels.  
It will also yield insight into innovative products and  
services that outperform competitors.  
With relatively little investment, mapping provides  
the strategic insight we need in today’s fast-changing  
marketplaces.  
Start a New Project 123Decide on a Direction  
There are several questions to answer from the outset of a  
project. These may be a simple matter of self-reflection, or  
they may need investigation. The two key areas of concern to  
address are the organizational goals and the types of expe-  
riences you should map. After determining those, select the  
appropriate type of diagram to create.  
# Identify the Organization’s  
# Strategy and Objectives  
Alignment diagrams must be relevant to the orga-  
nization. They need to answer open questions or  
fill current gaps in knowledge. Diagrams are most  
effective when congruent with the organization’s  
strategy and objectives.  
Some questions to explore in this step are\:  
•  
What is the mission of the organization?  
•  
How does the organization create, deliver, and  
capture value?  
•  
How does the organization want to grow?  
•  
What are the strategic goals?  
•  
What markets and segments are served?  
•  
What are the gaps in knowledge?  
# Determine Which Experiences to Map  
Most organizations have relationships with multiple parties\:  
suppliers, distributors, partners, customers, and customers’  
customers. To determine what experiences to map, first un-  
derstand the customer value chain\: a depiction of key actors  
and the flow of value to individuals.  
Figure 5-2 shows a simple example of a customer value chain  
for a news magazine, with the reader as an end consumer. In

124 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project Alignment diagrams must be  
# relevant to the organization. They  
# need to answer open questions or  
# fill current gaps in knowledge.  
this diagram, journalists provide content to publishers, who  
make money from advertisers. Stores distribute the publisher’s  
magazine to readers, who form the audience for the adver-  
tisers. Overall, value flows from left to right in this diagram,  
from journalists to readers.  
Figure 5-2 also indicates some possible diagram types that  
might best illustrate the relationship. A service blueprint  
makes sense to map the relationship between the publishers  
and the stores to help optimize backstage processes. But a  
customer journey map might be better to illustrate the ex-  
perience readers have with advertisers. And from the pub-  
lisher’s perspective, an experience map could be a good way  
to understand the journalists’ relationship to the magazine’s  
content.  
Customer value chains are similar to what are often referred  
to as stakeholder maps or ecosystem maps. You may come  
across these terms in other sources on mapping. The differ-  
ence here is the inclusion of the flow of value.  
There is no right or wrong way to create customer value  
chain diagrams. They are simple concept maps of the actors  
and entities involved in an experience. Ultimately, it’s about  
coming up with a model that fits your purpose. The process is  
straightforward\:  
•  
List all actors and entities involved in the experience being  
investigated.  
•  
Place the primary actor and primary provider in the cen-  
ter, with the provider to the left.  
•  
Place other actors and entities around the two in a way  
that shows their basic relationships.  
•  
Finally, reorder the elements as needed to show how  
value moves from providers to customers.  
Once completed, use the customer value chain map to exam-  
ine the various types of relationships that it’s possible to map.  
For instance, in Figure 5-2 the relationship of the advertisers  
to the publisher is unlike that of the publisher to the stores,  
and the relationship of the journalists to the advertisers is  
different from that of the readers to the stores.  
A customer value chain helps set expectations with your  
clients. You can clarify which experiences to map and which  
to exclude. For instance, in the previous example, if the pub-  
lisher is interested in learning more about the distribution of  
magazines to stores, and you were considering mapping the  
relationship of readers to advertisers, there’s a mismatch in  
expectations.  
Customer value chains can generally be completed quickly—in  
a matter of minutes in some cases—and it’s worth the effort  
to get a view of the ecosystem. This will help you scope the  
effort, select an appropriate diagram type, and also guide  
recruiting for research.  
Decide on a Direction 125Key questions when determining which experiences to map  
are\:  
•  
Which relationships in the customer value chain do you  
want to focus on?  
•  
What point of view do you want to understand in that  
relationship?  
•  
Which types of users or customers are most relevant?  
•  
Which experiences are most appropriate to include?  
•  
Where do those experiences begin and end?  
# Create Personas  
Personas are narrative descriptions of user archetypes reflect-  
ing common patterns of behavior, needs, and emotions. They  
reflect details about a target group in a way that is easy to  
grasp. Creating personas is an in-depth process that has a  
history spanning decades. For more, see some of the books  
on the topic, including Pruitt and Adlin’s The Persona Lifecycle  
and Cooper’s About Face 2.0 .  
Personas are generally short—not longer than a page or two  
each. Figure 5-3 shows an example of a persona document I  
created for a past project.  
When you’re illustrating a specific person’s experience, it’s  
common to include the persona or a shortened form of it in  
the diagram itself. For instance, Figure 5-4 shows a customer  
journey map created by Jim Tincher, founder of Heart of the  
Customer \(heartofthecustomer.com\), a consultancy special-  
izing in journey mapping. In this example, you can see the  
126 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project  
persona he created along the top of the diagram. It reflects  
basic demographic information, motivations, and a quote that  
customer might say.  
Creating personas is not creative writing. Personas should be  
based on actual data. The process consists of the following  
steps\:  
1\. Identify the most salient attributes that distinguish one  
segment from another. You can usually find three to five  
primary attributes to focus on.  
2\. Determine the number of personas that you need to rep-  
resent the range of attributes included. Collect data that  
supports and describes those attributes. Of course, your  
investigation may reveal new attributes to include along  
the way.  
3\. Draft the personas based on the primary attributes. Also  
include some basic aspects to flesh out the persona, such  
as demographics, behaviors, motivations, and pain points.  
4\. Finalize the personas. Create a compelling visualization for  
each on a single page. Develop various formats and sizes  
for different contexts.  
5\. Make the personas visible. Hang them up in brainstorm-  
ing sessions and include them in project documents. It’s  
your job to make them come alive.  
Creating personas is a collaborative process, so be sure to in-  
clude others too so that the resulting documents are remind-  
ers of shared knowledge. FIGURE 5-3. This example shows a persona for an architect.  
Decide on a Direction 127FIGURE 5-4. Diagrams often represent a persona at the top, as seen in this example of a customer journey map.

top-level strategic aspects  
of creating an offering and  
how it fits into a broader  
system of interactions of diagram that’s most appropriate. To do so, consider the  
primary elements of mapping discussed in Chapter 2.  
Table 5-2 summarizes some of the common diagram types  
and the differences between them along these dimensions.  
Another way to determine which type of diagram best suits  
your situation is to consider them along two dimensions\:  
scope and independence. Figure 5-5 plots the main diagram  
types discussed throughout  
this book in a simple matrix.  
The intent is to show the  
differences between types of  
maps, but there will always  
be exceptions. The colors in this figure represent different  
types of diagrams, with some of their alternatives shown. The  
size of each shape reflects the degree of variation within that  
diagram type.  
Diagrams toward the upper left tend to be more concrete.  
For example, user story maps show detailed interactions with  
a specific product. These are more volatile and may change  
with technology, but are great for illustrating an experience  
close to implementation. Moving toward the bottom right,  
the diagrams become more abstract, dealing with broad do-  
mains. Diagrams in this quadrant are stable and foundational,  
and help find broad opportunities for innovation.  
# Don’t rule out any one technique  
# in favor of another in advance.  
The chart in Figure 5-5 also helps answer the question of  
how often diagrams need to be updated. Typically, the more  
solution-independent the approach, the greater the longevity  
of the diagram. For example, if done properly, job maps and  
mental model diagrams can remain valid and stable for a de-  
cade or more. Diagrams toward the top of the chart tend to  
have a shorter shelf life bounded by a short-term project.  
The scope of a diagram  
helps determine how many  
diagrams will be needed.  
In general, the broader in  
scope, the more holistic it  
is and therefore the fewer diagrams are needed. It’s unlikely,  
for instance, that you’ll need more than one ecosystem map\:  
by definition it shows the big picture. But creating multiple  
service blueprints for various customer interactions across the  
organization is likely.  
There is no clear-cut answer to the question of how many  
diagrams you will need and how often they will need to be  
updated. In the end, it really depends on the factors detailed  
in Chapter 2\: point of view, scope, focus, structure, and use.  
Generally, there’s a desire to reduce your effort as well as the  
number of artifacts you create, so I advise creating multiple  
diagrams only if necessary to illustrate significant differences.  
Decide on a Direction 131What’s the Difference? Customer Journey Maps, Service  
# ­ Blueprints, and Experience Maps  
The types of diagrams most often conflated with one another  
are customer journey maps, service blueprints, and experience  
maps. Since these are all chronological and have a similar form,  
the mix-up is understandable. But important distinctions exist  
that should factor into your diagram type selection.  
The primary difference is the point of view of each—in particu-  
lar, the relationship of the individual to the experience\:  
•  
Customer journey maps \(CJMs\) view the individual  
as a customer of the organization. The story is about  
how someone becomes aware of the offering, decides  
to acquire it, and then stays loyal. CJMs help mar-  
keters, salespeople, and customer success managers  
look at the overall customer lifecycle to build better  
relationships.  
•  
Service blueprints detail how a service is experienced  
by a user in real time. The main concern is how well or  
poorly the service performs after it is acquired, so that  
it can be optimized. These diagrams help designers and  
developers improve service delivery.  
•  
Experience maps as I define them take a different  
perspective. They look at a broader context of human  
behavior and depict the sequence of events an actor  
takes while striving to achieve a goal independent of  
any solution or brand. Experience maps are useful to  
find new opportunities for innovation.  
In addition to point of view, there are differences between  
these diagram types in terms of scope. For instance, CJMs tend  
to be scoped very broadly over a long time frame, whereas  
service blueprints often focus on a specific episode but go  
into more depth. Experience maps will vary in scope, including  
everything from a day in the life to ongoing experiences.  
Focus varies across these types as well. CJMs focus on motiva-  
tions and triggers for becoming and staying a customer. Service  
blueprints expose a lot of the backstage processes and are  
light on emotional details. Experience maps are more free-form  
than the latter two types, but strive to get at needs and desired  
outcomes.  
To illustrate the differences, compare and contrast the following  
three examples. Each diagram is based on an imaginary case  
of a chicken crossing a road. The actors and the domain are  
the same for each, but the point of view, scope, and focus are  
noticeably different, as well as the style of mapping.  
132 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project Figure 5-6 is an example of customer journey map for the  
ACME RoadCrossr, a fictitious brand and product. This is an  
app that helps chickens not only find the best point to cross but  
also assess traffic conditions.  
A persona is included at the upper left, reflecting some key demo-  
graphic details. The phases extend from left to right at the top of  
the map, and actions, thoughts, and feelings are along the side.  
Moving left to right, we can see that the chicken in this case  
becomes aware of the app, decides to subscribe, and then  
initiates the service before trying it. Eventually, the chicken  
recommends it to friends. Overall, the plot of this chronology  
is about the go-to-market aspects of the service, from lead  
generation to conversion to advocacy.  
Service blueprints typically illustrate real-time interactions  
with an existing service. They focus on the nuts and bolts of  
service provision and tend to be much less about marketing and  
customer lifecycles than a CJM. As a result, you’ll see in Figure  
5-7 many of the backstage aspects of the ACME RoadCrossr  
service, including third-party and partner interactions. These  
FIGURE 5-6. A customer  
journey map \(CJM\) shows an  
individual’s interaction with a  
company and brand over time,  
highlighting the decisions to  
acquire a solution and stay loyal  
to it.  
Decide on a Direction 133elements are all aligned to the individual’s actions, shown in  
the second line from the top.  
Unlike CJMs and service blueprints, experience maps don’t  
assume the individual is a customer of a service or even needs  
that service. Instead, the example in Figure 5-8 focuses solely  
on the experience of crossing a road as a chicken.  
There is no purchase decision, nor are there details about using  
a given solution. As a result, multiple teams could benefit from  
this diagram\: it allows them to see how they can fit into the  
individual’s world, not how the individual fits into their offering.  
Considering how to get the chicken’s job done better can be a  
source of innovation.  
Compared to experience maps, CJMs offer a rather self-cen-  
tered view of the world\: they assume people want to become  
aware of and purchase the company’s solution and then stay  
around and even advocate for them—a tale of ideal market  
position. The underlying story is really about the company, not  
the individual.  
FIGURE 5-7. A service blueprint  
details the frontstage and backstage  
processes of a service provision  
within a specific episode of  
interaction.  
134 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project Service blueprints are less egotistical but still view the individual  
as a user of a specific solution. Brand and emotions are not cen-  
tral, in favor of an unveiling of the behind-the-scenes machinery.  
Experience maps are different. As I’ve defined them, they flip  
the perspective from viewing people as consumers to looking at  
their experiences independent of a solution.  
Note that my definition of an experience map may differ from  
others. It’s easy to find instances of diagrams labeled “experi-  
ence maps” that are really a combination of CJMs and service  
blueprints, including many examples in this book. But don’t get  
hung up on labels—they’re not that important at the end of  
the day.  
In the end, any or all of these maps may help your situation.  
The point is to understand the nature of the diagram type  
you are targeting before beginning an effort. Know who the  
audience of the map is and its purpose before you get started.  
Then, focus on how you’ll show value alignment visually to  
engage others in your organization in a conversation.  
FIGURE 5-8. An experience map  
can show how the individual goes  
about achieving a goal independent  
of any product or service.  
Decide on a Direction 135Define the Effort  
Once the overall direction of the effort is outlined, assess the  
amount of time needed and approximate costs. In this step  
you’ll also want to ensure you have the appropriate skills,  
equipment, and resources.  
# Estimate Duration  
The time frame for mapping efforts varies greatly. It depends  
on the formality of the project, the type of map you’re target-  
ing, and the depth of information it contains. Small startups,  
for instance, may be able to quickly create a map in a matter  
of days. Formal projects typically run anywhere from a few  
weeks to a few months in duration.  
Here are some relative time frames for various types of efforts  
to give a rough sense of durations\:  
•  
Rapid effort\: one to two days  
•  
Short, full project\: one to two weeks  
•  
Average initiative\: three to six weeks  
•  
Generous program\: more than six weeks  
The time estimate is primarily a factor of the extent of your in-  
vestigation, as well as how many revision cycles and meetings  
with stakeholders are needed.  
136 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project  
# Assess Resources  
The primary resource needed for a mapping effort is staff  
time\: someone to do the investigation, create a diagram, and  
facilitate workshops.  
Skills needed to complete a diagram include\:  
•  
The ability to organize a wealth of information and  
abstract concepts  
•  
The ability to collect data and conduct primary research  
•  
The ability to model and visualize complex information  
Other project requirements include\:  
•  
Access to internal employees. You will need access to  
internal members of the organization. Multidisciplinary  
teams are ideal. Diagrams are not a give-and-go deliver-  
able\: they necessarily involve people within the organiza-  
tion throughout the process. Their active participation is  
required.  
•  
Ability to recruit customers. You will need the ability to  
recruit external participants in your research activities \(as  
outlined in Chapter 6\).  
•  
Ability to travel. Depending on your industry and the loca-  
tions of target groups, some travel may be necessary for  
research.  
•  
Transcription service. Finally, depending on your research  
approach, you may want to record interviews with partici-  
pants and have them transcribed. Estimate Costs  
Costs can vary greatly. Table 5-3 shows high and  
low estimates for an alignment project. The main  
driver is the staff month estimate. This will vary  
depending on your resource cost per month. The  
high estimate assumes one person working two  
full months. The low estimate assumes a person  
completing the project in two weeks.  
Of course, it’s also possible to have larger or  
smaller efforts. These estimates are just median  
guidelines to give a sense of approximate cost  
ranges.  
# Write a Proposal  
Informal efforts may not require a proposal at all. Formal proj-  
ects will likely have a written statement of intent. Don’t be put  
off. A proposal need not be time-consuming or extensive. Keep  
it light by simply listing responses to each of these elements\:  
•  
Motivation. Include the reason why you’re embarking on  
the project with the organization at this time.  
•  
Aim. Include a statement about the aim of the effort and  
the overall timeline.  
•  
Goals. List the objectives and measurable outcomes of  
the project.  
•  
Project participants. List everyone involved and their roles.  
Mention that you will need access to internal stakeholders  
and their involvement throughout.

Scope. Indicate the experiences you’re intending to map.  
You can determine these from the customer value chain,  
like the one shown in Figure 5-2.  
Diagram type. If you have a target diagram type in mind,  
indicate that in the proposal.  
Assumptions, risks, and constraints. Highlight aspects of  
the project that may be out of your control, as well as the  
factors that may constrain the effort.  
In total, a proposal doesn’t have to be more than two pages—  
see the example in Figure 5-9.  
Define the Effort 137**Proposal\: Acme Customer Experience Project**  
The Acme Corp. has successfully extended its product and service offerings  
over the past decade, capturing a significant market share in the process.  
However, the experience customers actually have with Acme has grown  
organically and become disjointed, resulting in declining customer satisfaction.  
This effort intends to align internal activities to the customer journey in order  
to design a more cohesive experience across touchpoints and ultimately increase  
customer satisfaction and loyalty.  
# AIM  
Complete a customer journey mapping project by the end of Q1  
# GOALS  
1\. Involve stakeholders from at least 5 different departments throughout  
the project, from the creation of the maps to running experiments  
afterwards.  
2\. Generate and prioritze at least 100 new ideas to increase customer  
satisfaction.

This book is about possibilities. Throughout, I’ve highlighted  
many of the tools for mapping experiences, shown in Figure  
5-10\. Many of these tools and approaches will be discussed in  
subsequent chapters.  
But with possibilities comes choice. To help you select the  
best approach, consider the types of models that describe an  
experience\:  
1\. Models of individuals. Who are you designing for? Personas  
and consumer insight maps are examples.  
2\. Models of context and goals. Maps of experiences describe the  
circumstances of interaction. What are the jobs to be done?  
What are the individual’s needs, feelings, and motivations?  
3\. Models of future experiences. Finally, create models for the  
envisioned future state. What do solutions look like? How can  
we represent them for evaluation?  
At a minimum, use one of each. More is possible, but be careful  
of model proliferation. Don’t confuse your audience.  
Alternatives for an informal diagramming process might follow  
these sequences of steps\:  
•  
Experience map \> Storyboards  
•  
Personas \> Design map  
A more formal mapping process might include these models\:  
•  
Personas \> Mental model diagram \> Scenarios and  
storyboards \> Value proposition canvas  
•  
Consumer insight maps \> Service blueprint \> Storylines  
\> Business model canvas  
Always keep the intent of mapping in mind\: to tell the story of  
interactions \(past and future\) to align your team.

Define the Effort 139Summary  
Initiating a mapping project begins by framing the effort. Start  
by assessing the required level of formality. Generally, larger  
organizations striving to design holistic experiences across a  
system of touchpoints have a greater need for a formal effort  
than an individual person designing the interface of a single  
product.  
Both internal employees and external consultants may need to  
overcome potential barriers to get started. Know the ob-  
jections and be prepared with evidence to make convincing  
counterarguments. Also, identify a champion to pilot a project  
with. Demonstrating firsthand results goes a long way toward  
winning over others.  
The concept of alignment diagrams opens up possibilities for  
you\: there is more than one way to address a given problem.  
You’ll need to understand the organization and its goals to  
shape the effort in the way that has the most impact.  
It’s up to you to determine which experiences to map. Exam-  
ine various relationships in the customer value chain to narrow  
down possibilities and set the right expectations. Then select  
the diagram type that is most appropriate. Again, there are no  
right or wrong answers here. You’ll have to form a perspec-  
tive that works best for your situation.  
140 Chapter 5\: Initiate\: Starting a Mapping Project  
For formal efforts, define the project and summarize it in  
a written proposal. This should include motivations, goals,  
participants, resources, and approximate costs of the project.  
Be prepared to negotiate the details of the proposal with  
stakeholders to arrive at an appropriate, well-defined effort.  
Informal efforts may not require a proposal or much docu-  
mentation at all.

Simon David Clatworthy, The Experience-Centric Organization  
\(O’Reilly, 2019\)  
This book looks at organizations holistically and  
discusses how to shift companies to become truly  
customer-centric. Despite its grand intentions and  
theoretical underpinnings, the author keeps the text  
approachable and quite practical. The approach is  
based on a maturity model with five steps toward  
experience-centricity. Chapter 5 deals exclusively with  
organizing around experience. Tim Brown, Change by Design \(HarperBusiness, 2009\)  
This full-length book is the definitive work on design  
thinking. Based on his years of experience at IDEO,  
one of the most innovative companies in the world,  
Brown lays out a detailed argument in favor of design  
thinking. The theories are grounded in stories and case  
studies from the field. Though mapping plays only a  
minor role in the book, it advocates a change in orga-  
nizational perspective—one that favors empathy for  
users and a general outside-in philosophy that is core  
to alignment diagrams.

the positive effects of end-to-end experience design  
on the bottom line. Citing articles like this one can  
help convince stakeholders to embark on a mapping  
project.

■ Reviewing existing information  
■ Interviewing internally  
■ Creating a draft map  
■ Contextual inquiry and analysis  
■ Quantitative research  
■ Case study\: Music curation—user research and diagramming at Sonos I’m often stunned by how little some organizations know  
about the people they serve. Sure, they may have detailed  
demographic data, comprehensive purchasing statistics, and  
the like. But they fail to understand the fundamental needs  
and motivations of their customers.  
Part of the problem is that people’s behaviors are often irra-  
tional. They act on emotions and subjective beliefs. These are  
harder to understand and quantify and are generally not part  
of the business vernacular.  
Many organizations simply have a low appetite for under-  
standing the customer experience. These same organizations  
might be willing to spend tens of thousands on market anal-  
ysis reports—but getting out, speaking with customers, and  
observing them directly receives little attention.  
Uncovering deep emotional connections to products and ser-  
vices is a messy endeavor, but this type of investigation gets  
at the why of customer behavior. It favors understanding over  
measuring, quality over quantity.  
CHAPTER 6  
# Investigate\: Make It Real  
Creating diagrams of experiences breaks this pattern of orga-  
nizational navel-gazing. It shifts the mindset from inside-out  
to outside-in. Of course, the diagrams themselves don’t create  
empathy, but they spark and guide the conversations that do.  
It all begins with investigation. Research is necessary to inform  
your effort and provide confidence in your model of the expe-  
rience. Otherwise, conclusions are based on conjecture.  
What’s more, research into the customer experience is typi-  
cally eye-opening. There’s a healthy reality check for everyone  
involved. For instance, on one project I worked on for an ed-  
ucational testing service, my research found educators doing  
extra calculations by hand on paper. Adding a mechanism  
to do these calculations online was simple, but no one was  
aware of this need until we observed it. Users never com-  
plained about the absence of a calculator, nor asked for one\:  
they just accepted the system the way it was. But with proper  
qualitative research, we were able to find opportunities not  
shown in other data.  
143People use products and services in unintended ways. They  
find hacks and workarounds. They invent novel uses and ap-  
plications of the offering. In doing so, they may fabricate their  
own satisfaction. As Peter Drucker, the renowned “father” of  
modern management, famously wrote\:  
The customer rarely buys what the company thinks it  
sells him. One reason for this is, of course, that nobody  
pays for a “product.” What is paid for is satisfaction.  
Strive to uncover the value customers believe they are getting.  
Understanding how your offering gets their jobs done is a  
source of opportunity. Target your solutions to fulfill unmet  
needs.  
This chapter covers the five main steps of investigation in  
mapping an experience\:  
1\. Reviewing existing sources of information  
2\. Interviewing internal stakeholders  
3\. Creating a draft map  
4\. Conducting research externally  
5\. Analyzing the data  
The steps outlined in this chapter present a logical sequence  
to follow. You may find yourself moving back and forth  
between these activities fluidly. The process is typically more  
iterative than linear.  
144 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
# Review Existing Sources  
Take advantage of existing sources of information as a starting  
point. Begin by reviewing insight for patterns across various  
resource types, such as\:  
Direct feedback  
People typically can contact an organization in a variety of  
ways\: via phone, email, contact forms, online comments,  
face-to-face service encounters, and chat. Obtain a sam-  
ple of data for review—for instance, customer emails or  
call center logs for the past month.  
Social media  
Get a sense of what people are saying in social media  
channels in your field. Obtain a cross-section of posts  
that refer to your organization or offering on sites like  
Facebook and Twitter.  
Reviews and ratings  
Tap into reviews and ratings for relevant insight. Amazon.  
com is famous for its reviews and ratings; so are services  
like TripAdvisor.com for travel and Yelp.com for restau-  
rants. Also don’t forget comments and ratings in app  
stores as a source of insight.  
Market research  
Many organizations regularly conduct surveys and focus  
groups and send out questionnaires. These provide details  
that could inform your effort—get ahold of past market  
research to help provide insight. Usability testing  
If your organization has performed tests in the past,  
review them for insight into the overall experience users  
are having.  
Industry reports and whitepapers  
Depending on the industry you are working in, there may  
be reports available from analysts in the field.  
# Consolidate Findings  
You probably won’t find a single existing source of infor-  
mation about the end-to-end customer experience. Most  
industry reports and whitepapers focus only on slices of an  
overall experience. And unless your organization has already  
done work mapping experiences, it’s unlikely you’ll have any  
preexisting research in-house.  
Instead, you’ll have to pick through the available sources and  
identify the relevant bits. This is a bottom-up process that  
takes patience and tolerance for irrelevant information. An in-  
dustry report, for instance, may include only a few facts useful  
for your particular project.  
To help comb through existing data, use a common format to  
review findings across source types. Organize user research  
findings using a simple progression of three steps, focusing on  
evidence, interpretation, and implications for the experience\:  
Evidence  
First, note any relevant facts or observations from the  
sources of information without any judgment. Include  
direct quotes and data points to illuminate the evidence.  
Interpretations  
Explain potential causes for the evidence you identified\:  
why did people behave or feel the way they did? Consider  
multiple interpretations of the observed behavior.  
Implications for the experience  
Finally, determine the impact of the finding on the indi-  
vidual’s experience. Strive to include the emotional factors  
motivating their behavior.  
For each source, consolidate insights into a separate table. The  
consolidation tables help you sort through various information  
types. They then normalize findings for comparison across  
sources. Table 6-1 shows this type of consolidation from two  
different source types for a fictitious software service.

Review Existing Sources 145TABLE 6-1. Examples of consolidation of two different existing sources of information for a fictitious software service.  
Source 1\: Email feedback  
Evidence Interpretations Experience implications  
Many emails indicate trouble with installation\:  
e.g., “After going through the instructions and  
process several times, I gave up.”  
People lack the skills and knowledge to complete  
the installation process and get frustrated.  
People don’t have the time or patience to read  
the instructions carefully.  
Installation is a problematic phase  
in the journey.  
There were frequent questions about having  
admin rights to install the software\: e.g., “I got  
the message ‘Please contact your IT admin’ and  
didn’t know what to do.”  
For security reasons, many companies don’t allow  
employees to install software.  
It may be difficult or time-consuming for employ-  
ees to contact an IT admin.  
For users without admin rights,  
installation ends their experience\:  
it’s a showstopper.  
Some emails praised customer support\: e.g.,  
“The customer service agent I spoke with was  
really knowledgeable and helpful!”  
People like to be able to speak with a “real”  
person.  
People feel like they are getting personal atten-  
tion with live agents.  
Customer support is a positive  
aspect of the current experience.  
Source 2\: Marketing survey  
Evidence Interpretations Experience implications  
Respondents indicated that the top ways of  
becoming aware of the magazine are\:  
1\. Word of mouth \(62%\)  
2\. Web searches \(48%\)  
3\. Internet ads \(19%\)  
4\. TV ads \(7%\)  
Customers seek input from others in their deci-  
sion to purchase our software.  
Advertisements may not be as effective as previ-  
ously assumed.  
Word of mouth plays the great-  
est role in becoming aware of our  
service.  
64% of customers indicated they regularly  
switch between a computer and mobile device  
while using our service.  
People have a need to use the software  
on-the-go.  
Customers experience our soft-  
ware across devices.  
A majority of customers indicated installation  
was difficult or very difficult.  
Installation is not straightforward for some users.  
Instructions for installation are not easy to follow.  
Installation is a source of  
frustration.  
146 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real Make Conclusions  
Next, collect all the implications for the experience in a sepa-  
rate list and group them by topic. Patterns then emerge that  
bring your investigation into greater focus. For instance, from  
the data in Table 6-1, the implication statements are shown in  
the simple list that follows\:  
•  
Installation is a problematic phase in the journey.  
•  
For users without admin rights, installation ends their  
experience\: it’s a showstopper.  
•  
Customer support is a positive aspect of the overall  
experience.  
•  
Word of mouth plays the greatest role in becoming aware  
of our service.  
•  
Customers experience our software across devices.  
•  
Installation is a source of frustration.  
Some of your findings from this exercise will be straightfor-  
ward and not need much validation. For instance, you may  
find that how people become aware of a service may not  
need much further research. From the example in Table 6-1,  
you could conclude that word of mouth is the leading way  
people hear about your service. If you are creating a customer  
journey map, you can readily include this information in the  
diagram.  
Other points you uncover may reveal gaps in knowledge.  
For example, from the list of implications in Table 6-1, it’s  
apparent that frustration during installation is emerging as a  
theme. But you may not know why this is the case and need  
to further research the causes of this frustration.  
Overall, the process is grounded in evidence, moving from in-  
dividual facts to broader conclusions \(Figure 6-1\). By breaking  
down findings in a common format, you can then compare  
themes across different sources.  
Reviewing existing sources of information not only informs the  
creation of a diagram, it also sets up your research agenda for  
the following steps in this investigation phase. You’ll have a  
better sense about what to ask in your next phases of re-  
search, starting with internal stakeholders.  
This step need not take long. Depending on the number of  
sources to review, it may take only a day \(or less\) to complete.  
Try distributing the review of sources across several members  
to work even quicker. Then come together and discuss the key  
findings in a brief meeting.

relevant evidence, group the implications  
for the experience people may have,

Review Existing Sources 147Interview Within the  
# ­ Organization  
Alignment diagram efforts necessarily involve investigation  
with people within the organization. Seek out a range of peo-  
ple to interview. Don’t stop with the primary sponsors of the  
project. Include decision makers, managers, sales representa-  
tives, engineers and technicians, and frontline personnel.  
At this point, your investigation is exploratory\: you want to  
uncover the main themes to research further. The sample of  
people you have access to may be fairly small—only a half  
dozen or so in total. This also means you may only get one or  
two people to interview per function within the organization.  
If this is the case, assume your interview partner can speak on  
behalf of others in a similar function.  
# Conduct Interviews  
Internal stakeholder interviews can be informal and take  
anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. If many of the stakehold-  
ers work in the same location, these may only take a day to  
complete. Phone or online interviews are also possible if you  
can’t meet in person.  
Open questioning works best since you’ll be talking with  
different types of people. This is a technique that allows you to  
have a free-flowing conversation. Your interviews should not  
take the form of a questionnaire but rather a guided discussion  
with participants. The goal is to explore and learn, not to take  
148 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
# Mapping experiences starts  
# with low-fidelity models, not  
# with polished graphics.  
a quantitative poll. See the sidebar “A Brief Guide to Interview-  
ing” later in this chapter for more on open questioning.  
There are three key areas to include\:  
Role and function  
Start by getting the background of the participant. What  
do they do within the organization? How is their team  
organized? Get a sense of where they fit into the value  
creation chain.  
Touchpoints  
Everyone in an organization has some impact on the  
experience people have when interacting with them. In  
some cases, stakeholders have direct contact with cus-  
tomers. In this case, ask them directly about their per-  
spective on the customer experience. Others may only  
have indirect contact. Either way, probe to understand  
their role in the user experience and the touchpoints most  
relevant to them. Experience  
Find out what participants think people experience when  
interacting with the organization. Start by understanding  
the flow of actions\: What do customers do first? What  
happens after that? Also, probe on how the participant  
believes customers feel along the way. When are they most  
frustrated? What delights them? What are the potential  
moments of truth? Keep in mind their understanding may  
not match what customers actually experience. At this  
point, your investigation will generate assumptions that  
need to be validated with subsequent field research.  
Ask participants to draw a diagram of the experience, or parts  
of it, as they describe it. Figure 6-2 shows an example of such  
a diagram from my work. The sketch evolved over the course  
of the conversation and allowed us to point to specific parts  
of the experience and dig deeper. This drawing then served  
as a basis for creating a diagram. Mapping experiences starts  
with low-fidelity models, not with polished graphics.  
Alternatively, try using a template to have a guided conversa-  
tion about the user experience. For instance, Figure 6-3 shows  
an example blank template offered by UXPressia \(uxpressia.  
com\) that outlines a generic customer journey in manufac-  
turing. You can access other blank templates or create one  
of your own. The point is to have interview partners fill in the  
blanks to understand the experience together during your  
interviews with them. FIGURE 6-2. Have participants sketch during stakeholder interviews.  
Interview Within the ­ Organization 149FIGURE 6-3. A simple mapping template can be used to gather existing knowledge about an experience.  
150 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real Create a Draft Model  
At this point, you should be able to draft an initial diagram  
to serve as a preliminary assumption about the experience. It  
won’t be based on research, and is therefore just an educat-  
ed guess. But importantly, the draft diagram will guide your  
investigation by identifying gaps in knowledge and other  
research questions.  
Include others in the creation of a draft map. Assemble a  
small group of stakeholders to create a model of the expe-  
rience together. The goal is not to analyze the experience  
and add data points. Instead, the aim is to get agreement  
on the underlying model of the experience based on your  
assumptions.  
Use sticky notes to work out a preliminary structure for the  
diagram together. The aim is to think about how to tell the  
story of alignment and value creation for your situation. Some  
inference may be involved, and you may have to fill in gaps by  
making educated guesses at this point.  
There may be a tendency to try to propose solutions in this  
initial workshop. Let this happen, and be sure to capture  
those ideas. But don’t make the focus of the workshop brain-  
storming. Instead, concentrate on the diagram and generating  
questions for research.  
Note that in startups and “lean” efforts, creating a draft map  
may be all you need to do. Remember\: you’re looking for  
a common understanding within your organization of how  
you’ll create value for customers. If a small team is focused on  
how it will create user value, more formal activities may not  
be needed.  
# Touchpoint Inventory  
After you have an initial framework for your diagram, take  
inventory of current touchpoints.  
One way to do this is with a type of role playing or so-called  
“mystery shopping.” With this approach, you step through a  
defined process or flow as an individual would experience it  
and record the artifacts and evidence they come in contact  
with. This includes\:  
•  
Physical evidence, such as regular mail sent home, or even  
packaging  
•  
Digital touchpoints, including everything from emails to  
online marketing to use of software  
•  
One-to-one contact, such as a phone call with a sales  
representative or chat with customer care  
Mystery shopping might not touch on edge-case and excep-  
tion flows, however. Go back and find alternative touchpoints  
to complete your inventory. For instance, the emails that a  
solo trial customer gets might be different from those for a  
paid account with multiple users. Look at the broader picture  
so that the breadth of touchpoints is accounted for.  
Figure 6-4 shows an example of a touchpoint inventory from  
Chris Risdon, formerly of Adaptive Path and now at H-E-B.  
This was created for the Rail Europe experience map shown  
in Chapter 1 \(see Figure 1-5\). It’s a simple table with a list of  
Create a Draft Model 151FIGURE 6-4. Take inventory of existing touchpoints to understand the current experience.  
152 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real touchpoints per channel. In this example, each touchpoint is  
described with text, but you can also include a screenshot or  
photo of the touchpoint for higher fidelity.  
Both the draft diagram and a touchpoint inventory will help  
you understand the domain within which you are work-  
ing. This will guide future research. Keep in mind that mere  
inspection of existing touchpoints will not provide a complete  
picture of the customer experience. For that, you need to do  
research with actual customers.  
# Conduct Research Externally  
Research for alignment diagrams typically focuses on qualita-  
tive interviews and observations as a primary source of data.  
The draft diagram you cocreated with the team helps identify  
your assumptions and open questions about the individual’s  
experience. Structure your research to fill in the gaps in your  
knowledge.  
Rely on expert researchers to conduct the interviews if you are  
new to the technique. It takes some skill to be able to drive a  
conversation and get the data you ultimately need. Find prac-  
titioners within your company or through external agencies to  
help get the necessary qualitative insights.  
Conducting interviews and observations on location is the  
gold standard for this type of research. Face-to-face interac-  
tion with participants allows you to see their environment  
firsthand. Conducting remote interviews by phone or via  
teleconferencing software is a viable option that also yields  
quality insights. \(See the case study at the end of this chapter  
for an example.\)  
I view the research needed to map an experience as ethno-  
graphic in nature. As Clifford Geertz, the famous anthropol-  
ogist, shows us, thick description is the process of providing  
cultural context through systematic observation.\* The aim is to  
capture otherwise fleeting human behavior so that it can be  
better understood by others. This is the essence of mapping  
experiences.  
More recently, Tricia Wang has highlighted the importance  
of in-depth qualitative research as a way to gather what she  
calls thick data \(recalling Geertz\). In her TEDx talk in Cam-  
bridge, Wang says\: “I see organizations throwing out data  
all the time because it didn’t come from a quant model or it  
doesn’t fit in one. … \[Instead,\] thick data can help us rescue  
the context loss that comes from making big data usable, and

Approach your mapping effort with a mindset of modeling  
experiences after valid, real-world observations. The next  
section outlines a formal approach for field research, involving  
on-site interviews and observations. Remote interviews follow  
a similar pattern but involve less direct observation.

Conduct Research Externally 153Field Research  
One of the best techniques for investigation is a qualita-  
tive method called contextual inquiry , formalized and made  
popular by Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt in their book  
Contextual Design. This type of interviewing involves visiting  
participants on location, in the context of their experiences.  
Formal contextual inquiry can be time-consuming and ex-  
pensive. Full-blown research of this sort is not required for  
mapping efforts. However, understanding the principles of  
contextual inquiry is valuable for the type of field research  
required in general.  
On-site interviews and observations typically last from one to  
two hours. Longer sessions are possible but are typically not  
needed. Plan on conducting four to six interviews per segment.  
To gather feedback more rapidly, try sending several teams  
into the field simultaneously to collect data. Then debrief  
together at the end of the day.  
Field research can be broken into four steps\: preparing, con-  
ducting the interview, debriefing, and analyzing the data. Each  
is outlined below. Refer to the resources at the end of the chap-  
ter for more in-depth discussions on research techniques.  
# Approach your mapping effort with  
# a mindset of modeling experiences  
# after valid, real-world observations.  
154 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
Prepare  
Interviewing participants on location adds complexity to  
the preparation. It’s not like conducting a survey or remote  
interview. You’ll want to pay particular attention to recruiting,  
incentives, scheduling, and equipment\:  
Recruiting  
Be sure to brief the participants and set expectations.  
Remind them that you will be at their workplace or in  
their home during the interview and that you shouldn’t  
be interrupted. Also, be sure that it’s OK to record audio  
of the session. Use a screener to make sure you recruit  
appropriate participants and that they approve of the  
conditions. Don’t underestimate the time it takes to find  
participants; to take the burden off completely, rely on an  
agency that specializes in recruiting.  
Incentives  
On-location participation may require a higher incentive  
than other research techniques, such as surveys. It’s not  
unusual to offer several hundred dollars. Generous incen-  
tives typically make recruiting easier, so it’s not advisable  
to aim for cost savings here.  
Scheduling  
Since you’ll be going on-site, be sure to schedule inter-  
views with enough time to travel between them. Finding  
multiple participants in a single location is ideal, but not  
always possible. Typically, you’ll only be able to do two or  
three on-site interviews a day comfortably. Equipment  
Prepare thoroughly for each interview. Be sure to go out  
into the field with everything you’ll need\:  
– Discussion guide \(see the sidebar “A Brief Guide to  
Interviewing” on page 159\)  
– Notepad and pens to take notes  
– Sheets of paper for the participant to draw on  
\(optional\)  
– Digital voice recorder or audio recording app  
– Camera \(ask permission before taking any photos\)  
– Business cards  
– Incentives  
Parts of an interview  
Since you’ll be on location for the interview, you don’t want  
to overwhelm the participant with interviewers and observers.  
Research in pairs—no more than two people at a time. More  
than two researchers can create an unnatural atmosphere,  
which in turn can affect participant behavior and the insights  
you get.  
Determine clear roles for each researcher. One is the primary  
interviewer; the other acts as an observer. Maintain these  
roles. This allows the lead researcher to build a rapport with  
the participant and steer the conversation. The observer may  
ask questions at the end or when asked.  
There are four parts to an interview.  
1\. Greet the participant  
Greet the participant, explain who you are, and set the stage  
for the interview. Keep this brief. Confirm that it’s OK to  
record the session before starting the audio.  
Begin by having the participant introduce themselves and  
describe their background as it relates to the study.  
2\. Conduct the interview  
Use a discussion guide for open questioning. Have a naïve cu-  
riosity. The relationship you want to assume is one of master–  
apprentice\: the interviewer is the apprentice, and the inter-  
viewee is the master. In other words, don’t instruct or correct  
them, even if the behaviors they describe seem inefficient.  
You want to learn what they actually do in the situation you’re  
investigating, not what the assumed “correct” way is. Make  
the interview about them and their experiences, not about  
you or your organization. Focus on understanding the current  
experience to form the basis of your mapping effort, and  
avoid projecting future experiences or solutions.  
When asking broad, open questions, you may often get the  
response “it depends.” If that’s the case, try to qualify the  
question by asking about the most common situation or a  
typical situation.  
Conduct Research Externally 155One technique to keep the session moving is called the critical  
incident technique, which has three simple steps to follow\:  
1\. Recall a critical incident. Have the participant remember  
an event that happened in the past that went particularly  
badly.  
2\. Describe the experience. Ask them to describe what hap-  
pened, what went wrong, and why. Be sure to also ask  
how they felt at the time.  
3\. Finally, ask what should have happened and what would  
have been ideal. This typically reveals their underlying  
needs and expectations of the experience.  
The critical incident  
technique not only avoids  
generalizations but also  
gets deep insight into mo-  
tivations and philosophies  
people have about their  
experiences. In general,  
you want to bridge the gap between what people say or think  
they do and what they actually have done or would do.  
# Have a naïve curiosity. The relationship  
# you want to assume is one of master–  
# apprentice\: the interviewer is the apprentice,  
# and the interviewee is the master.  
3\. Make observations  
Take advantage of being on-site and make direct observa-  
tions. Take note of the physical arrangement of the space  
participants are in, what artifacts are present, and how the  
participant interacts with them.  
If appropriate, ask participants to show you how they might  
do a representative task. Keep in mind that some things may  
be confidential. Once they begin, simply observe with as little  
interjection as possible.  
Take photographs. Make sure to ask permission first and avoid  
including confidential information or artifacts in the photos.  
Video recording the  
session is also possible,  
but this is more involved.  
The angle of the camera,  
the sound quality, and  
lighting may distract you  
at the beginning of the  
interview. What’s more, analysis of full-length interviews can  
take a very long time. Don’t video the session if you don’t  
have the resources to review the recordings afterward. Instead  
of the entire session, try video recording short testimonials or  
responses to a few predetermined questions.  
156 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real Finally, also consider asking participants to sketch and draw  
diagrams of their work or activities. This can lead to new,  
interesting conversations and insights.  
4\. Conclude  
At the end of the session, summarize the main points to con-  
firm your understanding. Keep this short. Ask any follow-up  
questions for clarification. Ask if participants have any final  
thoughts about anything that was discussed.  
If you’re recording the session, keep the recording going  
during this part of the session. Often people interject import-  
ant details they previously left out. Even while walking toward  
the door, you may hear a new insight you’ll want to record.  
Make sure you give participants their incentive. It may be  
uncomfortable for them to have to ask you directly. The  
incentive is your way of saying “thank you.” Be sincere and  
appreciative as you hand it to them.  
Finally, ask if you can contact them later for follow-up ques-  
tions or clarification.  
# Debrief  
Schedule time to debrief immediately after each session or  
two. Review notes with your interview partner. Take the time  
to complete and complement each other’s understanding of  
what the participant said and did. You can start to pull out  
some main themes and highlights as well.  
It also helps to make a brief description of the customer’s  
environment immediately after the interview. If you were  
interviewing someone at their workplace, for instance, sketch  
a map of their office. Include tools and artifacts around them,  
as well as interactions they had with others.  
Create an online space to capture thoughts, particularly if  
there are multiple researchers involved. An online collabora-  
tion board such as MURAL \(Figure 6-5\) provides an excellent  
format to accumulate findings quickly. With each interview,  
you can add photos and notes from the field. The intend-  
ed structure of the diagram and elements it will include are  
already reflected.  
Conduct Research Externally 157FIGURE 6-5. MURAL \(mural.co\) is a good online tool to debrief after interviews.  
158 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real A Brief Guide to Interviewing  
Open questioning is a qualitative approach to interviewing that  
is well suited to creating alignment diagrams. The idea is to  
hold in-depth conversations with participants on their terms.  
Don’t read directly from a questionnaire, but instead probe in a  
nondirected way on topics relevant to the effort.  
# Journalist Interviews – Discussion Guide  
Thank you for agreeing to talk with us today. We want to take the next **1 hour** to  
understand your work and how you interact with the publisher. We’ll first ask a few  
questions and then have you do typical tasks using some tools around you.  
It’s important that we hear how you do work from **your** perspective.  
We’re going to record the audio of this session. It’s completely anonymous and just  
for our own reference later.  
We may take some photos—of course with your permission. If there’s anything that  
is confidential, just say so—we’ll respect that at all times.  
The aim is to embrace the uniqueness of the participants and  
their particular situation. What makes them special? What  
concerns do they have? How do they feel while experiencing your  
offering?  
This type of interviewing is an art. The challenge is balancing  
between a nondirected conversation and getting feedback on  
the specific topics you need to learn about. It’s the interview-  
er’s job to drive the conversation, letting go of control at times,  
and jumping in and steering the session at others.  
Use a discussion guide, such as the one shown in Figure 6-6.  
This is a one- or two-page document to refer to during the  
session, in this case for interviewing journalists. It’s a prompt  
for the interviewer, not a survey.  
1. **Background** \(5 mins\)\: Tell us a little bit about yourself and your work as a  
journalist. How long have you been doing it? What are your interests and areas  
of expertise?  
2. **Tell us about the last piece you wrote for the publisher** \(20 mins\)  
a. What were the triggers? What concerns do you have initially? How do you  
feel at the very beginning about a new assignment?  
b. How did you get started? What do you do to prepare to write?  
c. What background investigation did you do, if any? What prerequisite  
knowledge is needed?  
d. What is the writing process like? What concerns you most at this point?  
e. How do you interact with your editor? What is the most difficult part?  
f. What does it feel like when it’s published? Do you take any follow up  
actions?  
3. **What does a typical day look like for you** \(15 mins\)? \(If the participant  
answers “it depends,” ask\: “What was yesterday like?”\)  
4. **Social media**  
a. What role does social media play in the creation of a story? What are your  
experiences with social media?  
b. What role does social media play after a story has been published? How  
do you feel about it?  
A discussion guide typically begins with a standard greeting to  
set expectations. The body of the discussion guide consists of  
questions to prompt a conversation about the topics relevant  
to the study. These prompts should address the questions,  
assumptions, and gaps in knowledge you have.  
FIGURE 6-6. A sample discussion guide for a fictitious interview with  
journalists.  
Conduct Research Externally 159The discussion guide is more of a reminder of topics to cover  
than a script to read from top to bottom. In fact, you’ll rarely  
cover the themes in the same order as in your guide. That’s  
OK. If a participant immediately starts talking about one of the  
topics further down on your list, go with the flow and shift to  
that section of the guide.  
General Interviewing Tips  
•  
Create a rapport. Establish a bond with the participant  
and try to gain their trust and confidence.  
•  
Avoid yes-or-no questions. Strive to ask open-ended  
questions that keep the participant talking.  
•  
Follow the conversation. Use eye contact and affirma-  
tive gestures, such as nodding and feedback, to show  
you’re actively listening. Agree with them, when appro-  
priate \(e.g., “Yes, I can see how that could be frustrat-  
ing for you” or “Yes, that does sound like a lot of work  
for one person”\).  
•  
Listen. Let the participant do most of the speaking. Do  
not lead participants and put words in their mouths.  
Follow their line of thought and use their language.  
160 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Dig deep. Try to understand participants’ underlying  
beliefs and values. They may not offer this information  
immediately. Dig further with simple follow-ups like  
“Why do you think that is?” and “How do you feel  
about that?”  
Avoid generalizations. People often generalize when  
talking about their own behavior. To avoid general-  
izations, ask questions like “How do you personally  
accomplish that task or feel when doing it?” and “Can  
you tell me about the most recent time you did that?”  
Minimize distractions. People may get calls or be inter-  
rupted during the session. Try to restore focus on the  
interview as quickly as possible.  
Respect participants’ time. Be sure to start on time. If  
the interview starts running late, acknowledge that fact  
and ask if it’s OK to continue.  
Go with the flow. The setting for the interview may  
not be what you expected and may not offer the best  
conditions for interviewing. Try to make the best of the  
interview nonetheless. Analyze the Data  
Qualitative research uncovers tacit knowledge—a clear  
strength of the approach. However, the data you collect does  
not come organized. Instead, you’ll be left with a wealth of  
unstructured notes and recordings to plow through. Don’t be  
daunted. Let the overall story of the interaction defined in the  
Initiation stage guide your analysis.  
Diagrams of a current experience are aggregate pictures of the  
people and organizations you are investigating. When synthesiz-  
ing the data you’ve gathered, seek out the common patterns.  
From each interview, extract relevant findings and group them  
by theme. Then, align the conclusions into a flow or pattern  
of your diagram. Figure 6-7 shows the progress of moving  
from unstructured texts to common themes to sequences of  
experiences.  
# Informal Analysis  
One informal way to analyze the data is to cluster sticky notes  
on a wall. Figure 6-8 shows the creation of a mental model  
diagram using sticky notes. This can be done alone, or collec-  
tively in a small group.  
Alternatively, you may start analyzing data in a simple spread-  
sheet. Figure 6-9 shows a spreadsheet used to capture re-  
search findings. This is a modified version of a data collection  
sheet I used on a past project investigating a chronic illness. It  
allowed multiple people to contribute independently.

clusters, and then to the flows that make up a diagram.

FIGURE 6-10. MaxQDA is a qualitative text analysis tool that can be used to derive insights to use in mapping.  
Analyze the Data 163Formal Analysis  
A more formal analysis requires full transcripts of the audio  
recordings for each interview. A 60-minute interview may  
yield 30 pages of transcribed text. Consider outsourcing this  
step, as transcription is a very time-consuming process. There  
are also some modern tools like Otter.ai and others that will  
transcribe calls and recordings instantly, but the resulting texts  
may require some manual cleanup.  
Then, use a qualitative text analysis tool to comb through the  
transcribed texts—for instance, MaxQDA, shown in Figure  
6-10 \(preceding page\). First upload your interview texts \(up-  
per left\), then create a list of themes to code passages \(lower  
left\), and apply the codes to the interview texts \(upper right\).  
You can then view all coded passages across interviews for a  
given theme in one place \(lower right\).  
Reading the coded passages for a particular theme then  
allows for grounded conclusions about the experience. Com-  
pare the themes to your open research questions and incor-  
porate your findings into the draft map. Modern tools such  
as Dovetail and Reframer from Optimal Workshop allow for a  
similar type of analysis with simple online solutions.  
164 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
# Quantitative Research  
When you are creating an alignment diagram, a survey is the  
primary tool to get quantitative data. This will allow you to  
measure the same aspect across phases or touchpoints.  
At a basic level, try to understand what types of experiences  
people are having. For instance, a question could list a series  
of touchpoints and require respondents to select the ones  
they encounter. This would allow you to indicate the percent-  
age of people who encounter a given touchpoint.  
Asking questions on a scale is more powerful. This allows you  
to indicate how much of an aspect people experience, includ-  
ing such things as\:  
•  
Frequency with which phases or steps are experienced  
•  
Importance or criticality of a given touchpoint  
•  
Satisfaction at each touchpoint or phase  
When you create the survey, use a consistent scale throughout.  
If you ask participants to rank satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5  
for one question, don’t change to a different scale for the next. Creating a bespoke survey is no easy task. Consider using a  
standardized survey instead. For instance, NPS \(Net Promoter  
Score\) is a popular measure for customer loyalty, introduced  
by Fred Reichheld in his book The Ultimate Question. Or, in  
software and web applications, there are surveys such as  
SUMI \(Software Usability Measurement Index, sumi.uxp.ie\)  
and SUS \(System Usability Scale\)\* that have been around for  
decades.  
Other sources of quantitative information include\:  
Usage metrics  
Electronically enabled services—everything from online  
software to computer chips in cars—can capture actual  
usage data. Things like web analytics and software tele-  
metrics allow for very detailed measurement of usage.  
Call center reports  
Most call centers record the volume of calls and general  
traffic patterns. There is often a quantitative classification  
of call types as well.  
Social media monitoring  
Quantitative measures of social media activity can be  
considered for a diagram. These may include such things  
as traffic for each social media platform or the volume of  
hashtag uses or mentions.  
Industry benchmarks  
Depending on the sector and industry you are working  
in, there may be benchmark data available. This will show  
how your current service compares to others in the same  
field.  
As you collect data from these sources, think about how you  
might incorporate them into your diagram. Again, rely on ex-  
perts either at your company or through external agencies to  
help you manage quantitative data analysis. Many approaches  
depend on the type of diagram you’re targeting, its structure,  
and its depth. Chapter 7 discusses some specific ways to rep-  
resent quantitative information in an alignment diagram.  
\*  
For a thorough description of SUS, see Jeff Sauro’s article “Measuring Usability  
with the System Usability Scale \(SUS\),” Measuring U \(Feb 2011\).  
Quantitative Research 165Summary  
An experience is something that is constructed in the mind  
of the perceiver. It’s not something an organization owns. To  
map experiences, investigation from the perspective of the  
individual is necessary.  
Begin by assessing existing sources of information. This can  
include email feedback, phone calls, blog comments, social  
media activity, formal marketing studies, and industry reports.  
Extract relevant information that can inform the creation of a  
diagram. This information may be hidden or buried in existing  
sources.  
Also create a touchpoint inventory of existing physical, digital,  
and person-to-person interactions. Note the channel and  
means of interaction as you complete the inventory, and col-  
lect images of each touchpoint.  
Create a draft diagram together with the project team and  
stakeholders. This provides an initial picture of your current  
understanding of the individual’s experience. It also provides  
an overview of knowns and unknowns, which guides subse-  
quent research. In some cases, this may be all that is needed  
for your team to get aligned.  
166 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
Next, interview people internally within the organization.  
Get a mix of roles across functions and levels. Try to include  
frontline personnel in your initial interviews as well\: service  
desk agents and call center workers, for instance, often have  
a clear perspective on the client experience because they are  
serving them.  
Conduct field research to fill in gaps in knowledge and to  
deeply understand the individual’s experience. Go on location  
to the place where participants interact with the service in  
question. Engage them in interviews, but also observe their  
surroundings. Remote research using teleconferencing solu-  
tions speeds up the process but loses the richness of face-to-  
face interaction.  
Qualitative research can validate assumptions. Surveys and  
questionnaires work best here. The results of these methods  
can be included in an alignment diagram for greater impact.  
All of this data needs to be analyzed and reduced to just the  
key points. Only then can you start drawing a map of the  
experience with confidence. The next chapter discusses how  
to take the findings from your research and illustrate a map. Further Reading

In this article Wang introduces the notion of thick  
data, or qualitative ethnography descriptions, to  
contrast the quantifications of big data. With a hat tip  
to Clifford Geertz’s concept of thick description, thick

given context to reveal new patterns and explain why  
people behave as they do.

# Music Curation—User Research and Diagramming at Sonos  
# Case Study Title  
by Amber Braden  
by tk  
Sonos is a leading provider of wireless home audio products.  
From the customer’s point of view, the service is simple\: you  
connect your speakers to your home WiFi and then play music  
through your phone, tablet, or computer.  
The app for Sonos speakers enables control for multiple  
services, multiple rooms, and multiple people. While these  
components are important in making the service work, nothing  
really matters more to the users than playing music. The goal of  
this effort was to illustrate the complexity involved.  
Before attempting to diagram how people curate music, Sonos  
had to first understand how and why people used the product.  
Our research consisted of a series of extensive interviews with  
10 Sonos households over the course of two weeks.  
At first, we conducted interviews remotely. Using teleconfer-  
encing software and webcams we were able to get participants  
to demonstrate how they use the Sonos application on their  
phones. All sessions were recorded to show other stakeholders  
not present during the interviews.  
After that, we asked participants to record interactions with  
the product in a daily diary. The weekly check-ins with each  
household made for the most eye-opening insights. We found  
that when participants recounted stories they often revealed  
their deeper goals.  
Next, we examined all of the data we collected to find common  
themes. Using sticky notes and a whiteboard, we arranged our  
findings into a model that served as the basis for a diagram.  
Finally, we created a complete diagram reflecting the key  
insights from our research, shown in Figure 6-11.  
This simplifies the user’s experience by focusing on five key  
elements\:  
•  
•  
•  
User goals. We sought to uncover underlying motiva-  
tions\: what are customers trying to achieve when play-  
ing music? In each interview, we asked the customer  
why they did what they did.  
Supporting features. Recalling Indi Young’s process of  
creating mental model diagrams, we mapped features  
of our app to the goals. This helped stakeholders under-  
stand what features people used to get the job done. In  
our case, we found there was too much weight on the  
queue functions of the app, for instance.  
Benefits of features. Listing the benefits of the features  
reveals the value of the current features. This also helps  
with stakeholder buy-in. Instead of focusing on only  
negative feedback, show what is working well.

Case Study\: Music Curation—User Research and Diagramming at Sonos﻿ 169CASE STUDY  
•  
Obstructions of actions. The most important aspect  
of the diagram showed that the app didn’t support  
people’s goals. The obstructions got our stakeholders’  
attention.  
•  
Unused items. This section showed features that are  
not used when people are playing music. The list helped  
us decide what could be removed without having an  
impact on user goals.  
Once we’d created the model, we found that it could be used  
in multiple ways to engage with the stakeholders. Here are the  
ways in which we made the model actionable\:  
•  
Show the diagram during meetings and workshops.  
The model is simple enough that others don’t get over-  
whelmed. I showed it in a paper form and in electronic  
form. This helped create a common understanding of  
user motivations.  
•  
Print out the model for colleagues to use at their desks.  
Having the model distributed around the office and  
kept on or near colleagues’ desks helps socialize the  
insight and keep the conversation going.  
170 Chapter 6\: Investigate\: Make It Real  
•  
•  
Map new concepts to the model. Once stakeholders  
saw what the problems were, they came up with solu-  
tions. They saw how they could replace existing fea-  
tures with the new concept’s supporting features.  
Use the new benefits to write user stories. New \(or  
sometimes existing\) benefits served as a basis for writ-  
ing user stories for development teams.  
Creating simple models makes it easy for stakeholders to  
engage. It encourages people to use them as a reference and  
leverage them for various activities to help improve the design.  
We saw product managers, engineers, and designers use this  
diagram to help them understand what problems they were ad-  
dressing and how they could solve them. Since the model was  
based on firsthand investigation, we also had confidence that  
our decisions were grounded in actual customer needs.

■ Layout and form of a diagram  
■ Consolidating the content  
■ Designing the information  
■ Tools and software  
■ Case study\: Mapping the lab test experience “I’m not a graphic designer and can’t draw. How can I possi-  
bly create a diagram?” I get that reaction a lot in my experi-  
ence mapping workshops.  
There’s good news\: mapping is not about artistic talent. It’s  
about bringing all of your findings into a single, cohesive sto-  
ryline. The hard part isn’t the styling; it’s creating an insightful  
narrative of the experience.  
Consider the diagram in Figure 7-1, created by Eric Berkman,  
coauthor of Designing Mobile Interfaces. Visually, it has very  
few elements, but it reveals key insights about both negative  
and positive service aspects at a Starbucks coffee shop. Dia-  
grams don’t need to have elaborate graphics to be effective.  
In some cases, a mere row of sticky notes on a wall may be all  
that’s needed—for instance, in a small startup where you’re  
working closely together informally. Other times, you’ll want  
CHAPTER 7  
# Illustrate\: Make It Visual  
something more polished\: for example, if you’re presenting  
to the CEO of a large bank on a formal project. Regardless of  
the level of fidelity your illustration requires, a few principles  
of design go a long way toward creating a compelling visual  
story.  
This chapter discusses three interdependent factors in illustrat-  
ing experiences\:  
1\. Laying out the diagram, or determining the overall form  
2\. Compiling the content into a reduced format  
3\. Designing the information for a compelling visualization  
There may be movement back and forth between these as-  
pects, so be prepared to iterate. After this chapter, you should  
be able to transform the insights from your investigation into  
a meaningful diagram.

1.a Discussing  
with team the  
local places to

1.b Decid-

Starbucks and  
work on de-  
sign reports.  
1.c Hoping  
to find a close  
parking spot.  
1.d Hoping  
Starbucks is  
not overly  
crowded and  
will have avail-  
able seating.  
1.e Consider-  
ing alternative  
places just in  
case.  
2.a Notice  
that there are  
a couple of  
people in line.  
2.b Notice the  
narrow con-  
fined layout.  
2.c Enjoy the  
aroma of  
roasted coffee  
and mixed  
sweet robust  
smells.  
2.d The light-  
ing is pleasant,  
not overly  
bright and not  
too dim.  
2.e The music  
seems ethnic,  
extended  
vocals, soft in  
style, volume  
too loud and  
not my taste.  
2.f The room  
climate seems  
intentionally  
cold.  
3.a The wait-  
ing line occu-  
pies the main  
traffic way.  
3.b The  
menus across  
the counter  
are hard to  
read while in  
line.  
3.c The line  
moves slow,  
people who  
just ordered  
are still in the  
same area.  
Becomes  
crowded.  
3.d The order-  
ing process  
seems too  
slow. Inconsis-  
tent structure  
of service.  
4.a The Barista  
acknowledges  
me with a  
smile.  
4.b I can see  
the menu bet-  
ter now, but I  
feel rushed to  
order a drink.  
4.c I feel  
forced to  
make a quick  
beverage se-  
lection. I play it  
safe by having  
what I always  
get.  
4.d The baris-  
ta confirms  
my selection  
and asks my  
name to write  
on the cup.  
4.e He writes  
down my  
name and  
some code  
on the cup  
and hands it  
off to another  
barista who  
will make it  
when he is  
finished with  
other orders.  
5.a The barista  
tells me the  
total and I pay  
with my credit  
card. He asks  
me if I want  
my receipt, I  
decline.  
5.b My inter-  
action ends  
with him say-  
ing thank you.  
He doesn’t use  
my name.  
5.c Now I  
move to the  
left of where  
I paid. Once  
again I feel  
crowded and  
out of place.  
People are  
walking by me.  
There isn’t a  
designated  
waiting, sitting  
area.  
5.d As I stand,  
the drink  
maker shouts  
finished orders  
and places  
them on a  
drink stand.  
He screams  
Grande Chai.  
5.e Confu-  
sion. Is this my  
drink? Why  
did he not call  
out my name  
or name and  
drink? I pick  
up the drink  
and see that it  
has Eric writ-  
ten on it.  
6.a Grab my  
drink and look  
for a place to  
sit.  
6.b I need,  
most im-  
portantly, an  
outlet and a  
workspace.  
6.c I notice  
that there are  
only a few  
locations in  
the seating ar-  
eas that have  
outlets. This is  
discouraging.  
6.d Most  
places are  
occupied. No  
outlets are  
available.  
6.e The work-  
spaces seem  
small and  
impractical.  
Most are just  
a small  
round wooden  
table with  
two wooden  
chairs.  
6.f I find an  
empty reclined  
cushioned  
armchair.  
Next to it is a  
small wooden  
table shared  
by another  
person sitting  
in the other  
arm chair.  
6.g The chair  
is comfortable  
and I continue  
to sit in it.  
7.a The cup is  
hot, steaming,  
but withstand-  
ing in my  
hand.  
7.b Smells  
roasty and  
sweet.  
7.c First sip is  
too hot, but  
flavorful. I’m  
happy with  
the taste and  
my choice.  
7.d The  
continued  
sips remain  
satisfying.  
8.a I place my  
drink on the  
table next to  
me and place  
my bag on the  
floor.  
8.b I remove  
my computer  
and accesso-  
ries and now  
am shifting my  
coffee to find  
room for all of  
my things on  
this little cof-  
fee table.  
8.c The table  
is too low to  
work from  
there, so I  
place my  
laptop in my  
lap. My drink  
remains on  
the table, my  
bag on the  
floor.  
8.d I’m feel-  
ing crowded.  
I have no  
room to use  
my wire-  
less mouse. I  
now use the  
surface of the  
arm chair as  
my mouse  
pad. Not very  
effective.  
8.e The crowd  
talking doesn’t  
bother me  
after a while,  
but the music  
is way too loud  
and beginning  
to become a  
distraction.  
8.f I enjoy the  
free wireless  
and the unlim-  
ited use. The  
signal strength  
is adequate.  
8.g The music  
is really both-  
ering me. I put  
my head-  
phones on and  
play my mp3  
songs.  
8.h The bat-  
tery use on my  
computer is a  
concern now.  
I will begin  
looking for  
another table  
to work at.  
8.i The air  
conditioning  
seems inten-  
tional. It’s cold  
outside and  
cold inside. I  
slip my jacket  
on.  
8.j I continually  
finding myself  
people watch-  
ing while I  
work. There  
are interesting  
people here,  
so I’m not too  
bothered. I  
never like feel-  
ing alone.  
9.a The barista  
walks by me  
and makes an  
announce-  
ment to the  
tore that it  
will be closing  
shortly–10pm.  
10.a I pack my  
things up and  
head out the  
door.  
10.b The re-  
maining staff  
tell me to have  
a good night.  
9.b I would like  
to continue  
to work. I feel  
10pm closing  
time is much  
too early,  
especially in a  
college town.  
11.a I head to  
my car and  
wish that I  
could have  
stayed longer  
to work. I  
know that  
once I get  
home, I will be  
in the wrong  
mind state  
to continue  
working.  
9.c I stand  
up and walk  
around until I  
find a hidden  
trash can to  
throw my cup  
into.  
11.b The cof-  
fee was very  
good, but I  
was disap-  
pointed in the  
environment.  
Distracting  
music, small  
workspace,  
lack of power  
outlets.  
FIGURE 7-1. Eric Berkman’s simple but effective diagram of a visit to Starbucks reveals important insights with minimal graphic design.  
174 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Lay Out the Diagram  
Some methods prescribe a layout in advance. Mental model  
diagrams, for instance, are organized hierarchically into tow-  
ers, and a formal service blueprint will have prescribed rows  
of information by default. Otherwise, the layout and structure  
of the diagram are up to you, the mapmaker.  
I recommend a simple table or timeline, which works in most  
situations. But it’s worthwhile considering alternative forms  
as well. As discussed in Chapter 2, typical organizational  
schemes \(chronological, hierarchical, spatial, or a network\)  
will affect the layout of your diagram. Figure 7-2 shows some  
possible layouts.  
Regardless of the layout you use, the important thing to  
consider is how the form of the information can enhance the  
overall message. For instance, Sofia Hussain, a leading design  
strategist in Norway, created the diagram in Figure 7-3. She  
intentionally chose a circular form to show that success of this  
event planning app relies on repeat use. The form amplifies  
the message.

Lay Out the Diagram 175FIGURE 7-3. Make the shape of your diagram meaningful—for example, a circular diagram in this case reflects a desire for repeat use of an event planning app.  
176 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Displaying Chronology  
Chronological maps are simple for others to grasp but pres-  
ent a challenge\: not all aspects of an experience may be  
sequential. Some events are ongoing, some have a variable  
order, and others may have different subflows. You’ll have to  
overcome what I call “the chronology problem,” or showing  
irregularities in a strict timeline. Some tactics are shown in  
Figures 7-4a through 7-4d.

FIGURE 7-4c. ONGOING ACTIVITY\: Indicate the first time that an ongoing behavior  
occurs, and then show that it continues to avoid repetition. For instance, a salesperson  
may continually look for new leads throughout.  
FIGURE 7-4a. REPEAT BEHAVIOR\: Use arrows and circles to  
show repeating actions. For instance, during a sales call, the  
salesperson may alternate between showing a product and  
responding to customer questions.

FIGURE 7-4b. VARIABLE ORDER\: A cloudlike form can  
indicate that activities don’t happen sequentially. For instance,  
a salesperson may generate new leads, maintain existing  
relationships, and maximize reach all at the same time.  
FIGURE 7-4d. ALTERNATE FLOWS\: You may come across distinct subflows in the  
experience. Insert a decision point if needed, but keep this to a minimum to avoid  
overcomplication. For instance, a salesperson may have distinct activities based on the  
customer type.  
Lay Out the Diagram 177Compile the Content  
At this stage in the overall process, your aim is to map the  
current state of an experience. Mapping future states and  
coming up with solutions come later, as outlined in Chapters  
8 and 9.  
Reduce the data you’ve gathered to the most salient points  
and find common patterns. Work both from the bottom up  
and from the top down, alternating between the two \(Figure  
7-5\). Start by clustering and grouping findings repeatedly until  
you’ve reduced your research to just key insights. At the same  
time, work from the top down using your draft map to help  
direct your consolidation.  
Be prepared to shift things around. Your goal is first to create  
a prototype of the diagram, taking qualitative and quantitative  
information into account.

# Qualitative Information  
A majority of information to describe experiences is qualita-  
tive—rich descriptions of the why and the how , rather than  
quantitative data about how many . Here are some guidelines  
for determining the primary qualitative elements to include\:  
Create phases, categories, and divisions  
Determine the major “joints” of the model you’re creat-  
ing. In chronological maps, this means creating phases\:  
e.g., Become Aware, Purchase, Use, Get Support. There  
are typically anywhere from 4 to 12 phases. For spatial  
maps and hierarchical diagrams you need to create cat-  
egories. Try to find what feels natural for you and for  
stakeholders. Also keep in mind that the phase labels  
should be formulated from the perspective of the indi-  
vidual, not the organization. For instance, if you’re map-  
ping the experience of getting a new job, the first phase  
should be Start Search \(what the individual does\), not  
Recruit \(what the organization does\).  
Describe the experience  
Decide what aspects to show to describe the experience.  
Core elements include actions, thoughts, and feelings.  
Consider ways to make the description as rich as possible.  
For instance, you can include direct quotes from custom-  
ers or photos from your investigation. It’s up to you to  
determine what is most relevant for your given effort.  
The aim is to demonstrate what is valuable to both the  
individual and the organization through the condensed  
findings of your investigation. Show touchpoints  
Describe the interfaces between the individual and orga-  
nization for each phase. Think about the context of use.  
Remember, a touchpoint takes place within a given set of  
circumstances. Be sure that the information in the map  
surrounding the list of interfaces provides the context for  
those touchpoints.  
Include aspects of the organization  
Indicate which roles or departments are involved at each  
touchpoint. Other elements you can map are the goals of  
the organization, strategic imperatives, and even policies.  
Show what is valuable to the organization.  
Format the content  
Formatting the content is one of the trickiest parts of map-  
ping. After being steeped in data and research, you may want  
to include everything you’ve found. Resist this urge. Favor  
brevity. It takes practice to be able to express an experience in  
a compact form.  
Table 7-1 lists some of the guidelines to follow and shows two  
examples of the process of iteratively transforming research  
insights into concise content for a diagram. Notice how  
insights from research at the top of the table reduce down to  
concise statements. In this table, assume you are creating a  
customer journey map for a software company.  
The top row of Table 7-1 starts with insights that might be  
found from research. This isn’t what gets included directly in  
the diagram. Instead, the aim is to compress the raw insight  
down to its essence by transforming it with the process sug-  
gested in the table.  
It’s also important to keep the same syntax for each type of  
information. A cohesive system of content will make the dia-  
gram more readable and more unified. You can come up with  
your own patterns, but make sure you stick to the system for  
consistency.  
Here are example formats I often use in mapping for some of  
the most common information types\:  
•  
Actions\: Start each with a verb; e.g., download software,  
call customer service.  
•  
Thoughts\: Phrase as a question; e.g., Are there hidden  
fees? Who else do I need to involve?  
•  
Feelings\: Use adjectives; e.g., nervous, unsure, relieved,  
delighted.  
•  
Pain points\: Start each with a gerund; e.g., waiting for  
installation, paying invoice.  
•  
Touchpoints\: Use nouns to describe the interface; e.g.,  
email, customer hotline.  
•  
Opportunities\: Begin each with a verb that shows change;  
e.g., increase the ease of installation, eliminate unneces-  
sary steps.

Guideline Description Example 2  
Start with  
insights  
Start with clusters of raw obser-  
vations from your research.  
Research cluster 1\: People indicated  
they sometimes hesitate and reconsider  
during the customer acquisition phase  
because of our premium pricing model.  
Research cluster 2\: There is a clear  
pain point around deploying the  
solution, primarily due to lack of  
necessary technical knowledge.  
Use natural  
language  
Use language that reflects the  
individual’s experience in terms  
they would use.  
People reconsider when making a pur-  
chase because they may be nervous or  
anxious about the high cost.  
Users struggle to install the software  
for the first time if they don’t have  
the required technical skills.  
Keep voice  
consistent  
Rewrite the insights in either the  
first person or third person—  
pick one and don’t mix voice.  
I reconsider when making a purchase  
because I’m anxious and nervous about  
the high cost.  
I struggle to install the software for

Omit pronouns  
and articles  
To save space, omit articles and  
pronouns, which are implied.  
Reconsider when making a purchase  
due to anxiousness and nervousness  
over high cost.  
Struggle to install software for first

Reduce the information to reflect  
underlying motivations and  
emotions.  
Feel anxious and nervous when making  
a purchase due to high cost, and then  
reconsider.  
Struggle during installation due to

Be concise Rewrite the descriptions to use  
as few words as possible. Use a  
thesaurus if needed.  
Feel anxious during purchase about

180 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Quantitative Information  
Including quantitative content adds validity to your diagram.  
Consider how to incorporate metrics, survey results, and other  
data into the diagram. There are several ways to represent  
quantitative data, shown in Figures 7-6a through 7-6d.  
+  
# 1\. Word of mouth \(48%\)  
# 2\. Web searches \(26%\)  
# 3\. Internet ads \(19%\)

FIGURE 7-6a. SHOW NUMBERS AS TEXT\: Include numbers  
and figures to show absolute values. For instance, you may  
have quantitative data on how people find your service.  
FIGURE 7-6c. PLOT VALUES ON A GRAPH\: A simple graph shows the rise and fall of a  
given measure across a diagram. For instance, you may have quantitative data for customer

FIGURE 7-6d. USE SIZE TO INDICATE QUANTITY\: It’s also possible to show quantity with  
the size of a shape. For instance, this example could be used to indicate the number of  
customers that move through a typical purchase funnel.  
Compile the Content 181Design the Information  
People like information that is rich in presentation. Content  
that is presented with color, texture, and style has relevance to  
our lives and our work. The visual presentation of a diagram  
influences how others understand the information.  
Strive to create a consistent visual language that enhances  
your overall message. What insights should be highlighted?  
What are the key messages you wish to communicate? How  
can you make the diagram approachable, aesthetically pleas-  
ing, and more compelling?  
Even if you are not a graphic designer, there are some basic  
decisions you can make to help the clarity of the diagram.  
Stay true to these principles\:  
•  
Simplify. Avoid frivolous and decorative graphics. Strive  
for efficiency in display.  
•  
Amplify. The design should intensify the goals of the proj-  
ect and expectations of the sponsors.  
•  
Clarify. Strive to be as clear as possible.  
•  
Unify. Use consistency to achieve a well-rounded appear-  
ance and cohesive visualization.  
The key aspects to pay attention to are typography, graphics,  
and visual hierarchy, as discussed in the following sections.  
182 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual  
# Typography  
Typography refers to the selection of letterforms and the  
general design of text. Since experience maps are mostly text,  
the typography of your diagram is paramount to facilitating its  
practical use.  
Trypographical options can overwhelm. Let function and  
purpose guide your choice. When in doubt, favor legibility  
and intelligibility over flair and expression. Consider typeface,  
size and width, case, and bold and italic styling \(Figures 7-7a  
through 7-7d\).  
# Graphic Elements  
After you have compiled the content, consider how to repre-  
sent it visually. Graphic elements play an important part; you  
may not be able to create the graphics yourself, but being  
aware of a few basics will help you plan and critique the  
outcome.  
Show relationships with lines  
Lines are a principal means of showing visual alignment. They  
have four primary functions in alignment diagrams\: dividing,  
containing, connecting, and showing paths.  
Be careful of unnecessary lines. If every cell in a table-like  
diagram has a line border, for instance, the overall diagram  
will become unnecessarily heavy in feel. As a general rule of  
thumb, use as few lines as possible, and only use lines that  
carry meaning to the diagram. Serif

FIGURE 7-7a. SELECT A TYPEFACE\: There are two major categories of  
typefaces, serif and sans serif. Typically, diagrams use a sans serif typeface  
for the bulk of the information, but you can find serif typefaces being used  
as well. It’s best to use only one or two different typefaces in a diagram.  
Different font widths

FIGURE 7-7b. CONSIDER FONT SIZE AND WIDTH\: You will be motivated  
to use a small font size to get more information into the diagram. Avoid  
making the size so small it can’t be read. Instead, work with the content to  
reduce it to its most meaningful essence.  
Also, be aware of the overall width of the font you’re using. For instance,  
Verdana is a very wide font and not recommended. Instead, try a condensed  
or narrow font. Pair these with their regular versions for greater consistency.  
All caps\: full sentence vs. short label

BECOME AWARE  
DECIDE  
FIGURE 7-7c. PAY ATTENTION TO CASE\: Generally, longer texts are harder  
to read in capital letters than in mixed case. They will take up more space  
as well. Single words or short phrases, however, such as the title of a phase  
in a journey, may work well in uppercase. Use all caps sparingly to add  
emphasis or show differences.  
Different font styles for emphasis

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Frutiger Light Italic  
FIGURE 7-7d. EMPHASIZE WITH BOLD AND ITALIC STYLES\: Use bold and  
italics to help distinguish different information types, but do so sparingly.  
Generally, the information will be more readable if you keep the same  
weight and style. A mix of bold and italics can get messy quickly.  
Legibility also changes with bold and italics. Making a text large and bold  
may not necessarily make it more readable. For instance, Frutiger Ultra  
Black draws attention but doesn’t make the text easier to read. Likewise,  
long texts in Frutiger Condensed italics are less legible.  
Design the Information 183Convey information with color  
Color is more than just decoration. It helps create a sense of  
priority and facilitates overall understanding. Two key uses of  
color in experience mapping are color-coding and showing  
background regions, as illustrated in Figure 7-8\:  
•  
Color-coding allows viewers to see individual facets of  
information across the diagram. This is crucial for creating  
a sense of visual alignment. For instance, pain points or  
moments of truth may have a consistent color through-  
out the diagram. Even if they are not on the same line of  
sight, color will visually connect different facets of infor-  
mation throughout the diagram.  
•  
Note that color-blind viewers may not be able to dis-  
tinguish colors well, and also that colors have different  
meanings in ­ different cultures.  
Use color to create backgrounds within the diagram. This  
avoids unnecessary use of lines. For instance, the phases of a  
journey may each have a different color to distinguish them.  
You can also accomplish dividing and containing by using  
values of a single color, rather than introducing new colors.  
The use of too many colors can have diminishing returns.  
Use color purposefully for emphasis, and be sure to make it  
consistent.

FIGURE 7-8. Convey information with color.  
184 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Add icons for efficiency  
Icons not only communicate a great deal of information in a  
small amount of space, they also add visual interest. Typical  
icons found in maps of experiences include people, physical  
evidence of touchpoints, emotions, and moments of truth  
\(see Figure 7-9\).  
There are many directions you can take, with near endless  
variation \(e.g., solid backgrounds versus outlines only, as seen  
People  
Physical Evidence  
Emotions  
Moments of Truth  
in the first row of Figure 7-9\). Come up with your own style  
for icons, and keep that consistent throughout the diagram.  
Keep in mind that not all information types can be represent-  
ed as icons. If there’s a chance of ambiguity, create a key to  
explain the icons. Also keep in mind that if there are too many  
icons it will be difficult to comprehend the diagram\: the read-  
er will constantly have to refer back to the key to understand  
the information. Strive to represent the  
content of the diagram in such a way that  
it can be read without reference to a key or  
further explanation.  
Also note that icons can have different  
meanings in different cultures. Consider  
how you might express the thought or con-  
cept you’d like to iconize with as little bias  
and as few cultural implications as possible.  
The Noun Project \(thenounproject.com\) is a  
website that aggregates icons and symbols  
from contributors around the world. The  
images are readily accessible for use, either  
in the public domain or with a Creative  
Commons license. It’s a great resource for  
icons that can help you achieve consistency  
in your diagrams.  
FIGURE 7-9. Add icons for efficiency.  
Design the Information 185Visual Hierarchy  
Not all information in a diagram is of equal importance.  
Create a visual hierarchy to direct how the eye perceives the  
experience you’re mapping. As illustrated and explained in  
Figures 7-10a through 7-10d, techniques for this include good  
alignment, different visual weights for emphasis, layering, and  
avoiding chartjunk.  
FIGURE 7-10a. ALIGN ELEMENTS\: Visual alignment is critical to your  
diagram. A grid is an invisible structure of equally spaced lines to which  
elements are justified. This creates clear lines and guides readers’ line of  
sight vertically and horizontally. Strive for alignment even if you are using a  
spreadsheet or mapping sticky notes on a wall.  
FIGURE 7-10b. CREATE EMPHASIS\: The weight and size of both text and  
graphic elements provide focus and differentiation. For instance, in this  
image the phase headers \(“RUN,” “FOLLOW-UP,” etc.\) are larger than the  
rest of the text, providing a sense of hierarchy. There are also different sizes  
of arrows to show different aspects of the experience.  
186 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual FIGURE 7-10c. LAYER INFORMATION\: Make some  
elements stand out more than others by layering  
different sized texts and different shading. In this  
example, “uncertainty” is shown with background  
shading, and specific emotions are shown as positive  
or negative, all within a small space on the diagram.

FIGURE 7-10d. AVOID CHARTJUNK\: “Chartjunk,”  
a term coined by information design expert Edward  
Tufte, is anything unnecessary in an information  
display. Make every mark count.  
Design the Information 187Example Diagramming Process  
Overall, the process of illustrating an experience in a single dia-  
gram is iterative. The insights you’ll map drive the visualization,  
and the visualization will impact the form of those insights.  
Figure 7-11 shows an example draft diagram for organizing a  
conference event. It reflects a first pass at consolidating the  
research observations to include in the map. Thought has  
been given to the chronological phases, the wording and  
formatting of text, and the balance of content in general.  
FIGURE 7-11. Before adding graphic detail, find the right layout and consolidate the insights from your investigation into a draft diagram.  
188 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual FIGURE 7-12. Use visual design elements to tell a more compelling story and guide your audience through the experience.  
Design the Information 189The next step is to add a more visually compelling narrative.  
Figure 7-12 shows an updated version of the draft diagram  
created by Hennie Farrow, VP of design and UX.  
Various aspects of design come together in Figure 7-12 to  
guide the audience through the experience in a more engag-  
ing and compelling way\:  
Typography  
In addition to a regular font \(Frutiger\), this diagram also  
uses a condensed font \(Frutiger Condensed\) to make the  
best use of space. All capitals are used for row headers  
for emphasis and to set  
them off from other  
text. The text has even  
size and weighting for  
the most part, with bold  
and italics used sparingly  
for emphasis.  
Hierarchy  
Horizontal and vertical alignment creates a sense of rows  
and columns across the diagram. Different background  
shadings set the row and column headers and the phases  
\(“Plan,” “Run,” and “Follow-Up”\) off from the main con-  
tent of the map.  
# People like information that is rich in  
# presentation. The visual presentation  
# of a diagram influences how others  
# understand the information.  
Content  
There is a consistent use of syntax—for instance, verbs for  
the main phase and adjectives for feelings. The voice is  
consistent as well.  
Graphic elements  
Color is used to distinguish the different facets of infor-  
mation in the rows. The first column with the row labels  
has darker backgrounds, providing depth to the overall  
diagram and giving that information priority.  
Icons are added for visual interest. Each information  
type also includes a unique  
element to help provide  
a sense of cohesion. For  
instance, the organizational  
goals have arrows to show  
the desired direction of the  
outcome, pain points have a  
square bullet, and key ques-  
tions have a line. The moment of truth in this experience  
is indicated with a graphic element in the middle.  
190 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Showing Your Emotions  
Emotions play a critical role in the experiences we have. Some  
description of the individual’s emotive state of mind is neces-  
sary when mapping experiences, but emotions aren’t easy to  
represent in a diagram.  
The simplest approach is to indicate emotions with text. It’s  
also possible to show emotions using icons of facial expres-  
sions. Figure 7-13 shows a simple but highly effective diagram  
created by Craig Goebel for Intuit.  
Notice also how the emotional journey in Figure 7-13 is plotted  
on a line that moves up and down with the different states of  
feeling. This is a common approach that has emerged over the  
past few decades. Figure 7-14 is an early example from a 2004  
report by Ed Thompson and Esteban Kolsky titled “How to  
Approach Customer Experience Management”; it’s an excerpt  
from a diagram assessing the experience of business passen-  
gers on a major US airline.  
One problem with the plotted-line approach is that it suggests  
some kind of quantification. However, rarely is this information  
derived from quantitative investigation—typically, it’s estimat-  
ed intuitively. Be careful what you communicate and how.  
What’s more, the plotted-line approach oversimplifies the emo-  
tions. It’s unusual for us to have just one emotion at a time. For  
example, when checking out of a hotel resort after a two-week  
vacation, you may be delighted with the service but sad to  
leave or even anxious about going back to work on Monday—  
all at the same time.  
An approach that I typically take focuses on a range of possible  
emotions by indicating the most prevalent positive and nega-  
tive emotion at each phase of the experience. The “Feelings”  
row in Figure 7-12 is an example of this\: notice that the curved  
line specifically reflects “uncertainty,” which drives a lot of the  
emotions uncovered during research.  
Understanding and representing emotions is a challenge.  
Consider the tradeoffs you’ll have to make and how best to  
characterize the emotional aspects of the experience you’re  
illustrating.  
Design the Information 191FIGURE 7-13. This journey map created by Craig Goebel consists primarily of emotional states shown with icons plotted on a curve.  
192 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual FIGURE 7-14. The idea of plotting emotional highs and lows is common in mapping and appeared as early as 2004.  
Design the Information 193Tools and Software  
There are a range of tools and software you can use to  
illustrate a diagram depending on your skills and need. For  
informal efforts, a simple whiteboard with sticky notes may  
suffice. In other cases a more polished diagram may be for-  
mally presented to clients and stakeholders.  
This section reviews various types of tools you can use for  
mapping.  
# Desktop Software  
There are a range of desktop tools avail-  
able. These include\:  
Diagramming tools  
Omnigraffle for Mac and Visio for  
Windows are often used to create  
workflow diagrams, flowcharts, and  
site maps. They have rich diagramming  
capabilities that can yield high-quality  
final diagrams.  
High-end graphics applications  
The programs from the Adobe Creative  
Suite—in particular, Illustrator \(shown  
in Figure 7-15\)—are widely used  
applications. Sketch is a more recent  
tool that has become very popular,  
and Figma offers a powerful online graphics editing environment directly through a browser.  
These programs require training and practice to use  
properly.  
Spreadsheets  
It’s also possible to create diagrams in programs like  
Microsoft Excel. The important thing to look for in alternative  
programs like this is the ability to work on a large, near-  
limitless canvas. Presentation programs, such as PowerPoint  
or Keynote, generally don’t extend far enough in width or  
height to be able to accommodate a full alignment diagram.  
FIGURE 7-15. The experience map example in Figure 7-12 was created with Adobe Illustrator, a  
high-end graphics program.  
194 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual Web-Based Mapping Tools  
Web-based tools for mapping are becoming more powerful.  
They have the benefit of easy sharing and high portability. If  
you’re working with people in different locations, an online  
tool can support remote collaboration. Here are some of the  
types of tools that are available\:  
Touchpoint management programs  
Touchpoint Dashboard \(touchpointdashboard.com\) is a  
leading example of an online tool specifically for managing  
touchpoints \(see Figure 7-16\). This type of tool is best suited  
to tracking changes to touchpoints over time. Because it’s  
database-driven, it also allows for multiple views of infor-  
mation. For instance, you can filter and change views to see  
your data from multiple perspectives. This isn’t possible with  
graphics programs and other desktop software.  
FIGURE 7-16. Touchpoint Dashboard is an online tool used to manage  
touchpoints.  
Online mapping tools  
UXPressia \(uxpressia.com\) is a leading for-purpose online  
mapping tool that offers many templates to get you  
started, as well as the ability to collaborate with col-  
leagues directly in a map. Others include Smaply \(smaply.  
com\) and Canvanizer \(canvanizer.com\).  
Online diagramming tools  
Lucidchart \(lucidchart.com\) is an online diagramming  
tool akin to Omnigraffle or Visio. It has the advantage of  
being integrated directly into Google Drive.  
Online whiteboards  
Online whiteboards such as MURAL \(mural.co\) and other  
similar tools work well for all aspects of the mapping  
process. Their flexibility and large canvas area allow for  
the creation of detailed diagrams, all online. This opens  
up the process for active contributions from others on an  
ongoing basis.  
Figure 7-17 shows a mapping exercise I completed using  
MURAL. There are several things to note here. First, multi-  
ple activities can be included in one diagram\: value chain  
mapping, personas, empathy maps, and experience maps.  
Second, the large virtual service allowed us to compare  
two different experiences—in this case, going to the  
supermarket by bicycle and by car. Finally, working online  
allows for the integration of images to make the descrip-  
tion of an experience even richer. MURAL also allows for  
multiple people to collaborate in real time in the cloud.

The goal at this stage in the process is to assemble the in-  
sights from your investigation into a single diagram. Mapping  
the experience not only captures a great deal of information  
in a compact space, but provides a compelling form of story-  
telling that stakeholders want to engage with.  
The shape of your diagram conveys meaning. Typically, a  
chronological diagram will have a table-like or timeline layout.  
But there are alternatives as well, such as circular layouts,  
spider-like networks, and “snakes and ladders.” Consider how  
the form of the diagram amplifies the overall message.  
Getting the content to fit in a condensed format is challeng-  
ing. This is an iterative process of clustering and grouping and  
clustering the groups. Your goal is to reduce the information  
to representative aggregate behavior for the target group.  
Thinking from the top down helps with this process. Use the  
form and structure of your diagram to guide you in compiling  
the content.  
It’s important to understand the basics of information de-  
sign and the importance of visualization, even if you are not  
a graphic designer. Typography is critical since much of the  
body is text. Graphic elements add visual interest and efficien-  
cy. Lines, shapes, icons, and colors enhance comprehension.  
Visual hierarchy also plays a role. Not all elements are of equal  
importance. Use layering and different sizes to bring some  
aspects to the foreground and to push others into the back-  
ground. If you need to hire a graphic designer, you should be  
able to discuss some of these basics with them.  
There are a variety of tools for illustrating a diagram. Using  
spreadsheets and diagramming tools provides an easy start  
and quick results. High-end graphic applications can produce  
polished maps, but require expert skills to operate. There are  
more and more online tools available, including for-purpose  
mapping solutions and multipurpose whiteboarding solutions.

# CASE STUDY  
Mad\*Pow was approached by an international laboratory and  
diagnostics company to improve the patient’s lab test expe-  
rience. Our process for creating compelling user experiences  
always starts with research. To improve a service, we need to  
understand that service from the customer’s point of view.  
We start by mapping out the current experience, using a com-  
bination of stakeholder and user interviews, along with direct  
exposure to the service, staff, and operations to produce the  
materials and insights.  
From the research we build a narrative that describes how  
a customer interacts with the service. The narrative may be  
generic or may represent a scenario associated with a specific  
persona developed through the research. We organize the  
steps of the customer’s experience in a chronological sequence,  
and then group the steps into stages that identify meaningful  
transitions.  
For example, in this case our research showed that several  
stages precede scheduling the appointment. The first stage,  
FIGURE 7-18. The first step is to map user journey stages and touchpoints.  
Case Study\: Mapping the Lab Test Experience﻿ 199CASE STUDY  
Awareness of a Health Problem, is followed by Evalu-  
ation of Whether or Not to Seek Medical Help, when  
most users independently search for an evaluation of  
their symptoms. This approach produced a customer  
journey map showing the stages, steps, and patient  
touchpoints associated with each step \(Figure 7-18\).  
This allowed us to show our client how their service fit  
into their customer’s larger health care journey.  
The stages of the journey are also the structure for  
building individual customer scenarios. We can select  
a persona developed through the research \(Figure  
7-19\) and build a scenario for that character, adding a  
layer of customer emotions to the journey.  
These emotional responses help us identify steps  
where the experience could be improved. The perso-  
na’s moments of concern, discomfort, and anxiety can  
be made visible through a combination of emotional  
symbols and quotes, bringing the customer’s experi-  
ence to the forefront.  
In this example, we have encoded the persona’s  
emotions with a single color and variations of facial  
expressions. Color variation is used only to call  
attention to the two moments in the journey where  
changes could have a positive impact. We broke the  
anxiety-producing step of waiting for test results into  
three additional steps to emphasize the amount of  
negative activity and feeling the waiting period can  
produce for this persona \(see Figure 7-20\). FIGURE 7-19. In the second step, select a persona to build an individual journey.  
200 Chapter 7\: Illustrate\: Make It Visual In this scenario, the customer is interacting with staff at the offices  
of both the health care provider and the testing lab. By adding  
frontstage processes for both locations, then aligning these with  
backstage processes needed to support the customer’s touch-  
points, the map can be expanded to include elements of a service  
blueprint \(Figure 7-21\).  
This approach produces a highly readable and condensed cus-  
tomer journey map, with the option to add more complex service  
blueprint information as needed to illustrate current gaps and  
opportunities for changing the offering to produce the desired  
improvement.

# Alignment Workshops\: Find the  
# Right Problem to Solve  
I’m lucky\: throughout the majority of my career I’ve had the  
fortune to come into direct contact with the customers of  
the companies I worked for. I’ve observed hundreds of peo-  
ple at their workplaces or in retail stores or in their homes,  
across many industries. I’ve observed what they experience  
in context.  
Ideally, everyone in an orga-  
nization would get firsthand  
contact with customers.  
But for many this type of  
exposure is limited. Even frontline personnel, such as customer  
support center agents, may see only a few of the experiences  
customers have. Anecdotes come in without context.  
A broader picture is needed in order to connect the dots, or  
varying perspectives about the customer experience across  
the organization. Diagrams provide such a view. But creating  
a diagram is not the ultimate goal. Rather, it is a means to  
# A diagram is a means to engage  
# others in a conversation.  
engage others in your organization in a conversation. It’s your  
job to make that happen.  
You have to take the story of what customers actually experi-  
ence back to the organization. Consequently, your role switches  
from mapmaker to facilitator at this point in the process. Your  
aim is to get alignment on  
the current situation and  
on how your organization  
comprehends the notion of  
customer experience. If the  
team members don’t agree on where they currently are, how  
can they agree on the best future direction? Your diagram will  
help calibrate a common understanding.  
An alignment workshop is an event that brings others to-  
gether to focus on the experience from the outside in. The  
concepts you’ll envision will frame the problem to be solved,  
but will not necessarily be implementation-ready.  
207This chapter outlines the four stages of the session, shown in  
Figure 8-1\:  
•  
Empathize\: Gain a shared understanding of the individu-  
al’s experience from an outside-in perspective.  
•  
Envision\: Find opportunities and imagine future solutions.  
•  
Evaluate\: Articulate ideas quickly and test them for imme-  
diate feedback.  
•  
In a final stage, you’ll plan experiments to test  
your hypotheses.  
In the next phase, discussed in the next chapter, you’ll run  
the experiments you plan and move into designing concrete  
solutions.  
Empathize  
Envision Evaluate Plan Experiments  
FIGURE 8-1. The main parts of an alignment workshop are to empathize,  
envision, and evaluate, and then plan experiments around concrete  
solutions.  
# Empathize  
It’s not enough that you empathize with the experiences  
people have. You need to ensure that others gain that same  
deep understanding. Strive to spread empathy throughout the  
organization. The type of empathy I’m referring to here is one  
of understanding and comprehension. It’s about seeing the  
world through someone else’s eyes.  
More than that, strive to motivate others to turn their empa-  
thy into compassion by taking action to address issues and  
create an overall positive user experience. The goal is to devel-  
op an implicit sense of what an experience is like, what people  
value, and what emotions are involved. Diagrams allow you  
to walk through an experience in slow motion, bringing that  
type of compassion into your organization.  
The process begins by first understanding the current experi-  
ences. Then, assess how well you support those experiences  
before finally finding opportunities to create unique value.  
To kick off the workshop, review the findings from your investiga-  
tion together as a group. Make the diagram the focal point. Com-  
plement it with other artifacts you’ve created, such as personas.  
You can also play video clips from interviews to highlight a  
specific state of mind or pain point, or have coresearchers tell  
stories from the field that bring the experience to life. Portray  
a rich description of the world as you’ve observed it in a way  
that is relevant to the organization.  
After setting the stage, have the participants engage with  
the diagram. Display it prominently so a group of people can  
208 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve stand around it \(Figure 8-2\). The aim is to immerse the team  
in the details of the experience by examining the map togeth-  
er. If there are many sections to the diagram, break the team  
up and have each group read through a different part.  
The workshop is not a presentation for passive consumption.  
Instead, participants are active contributors. There are several  
techniques you can use to engage them from the start\:  
Mark up the diagram  
Invite people to comment on, correct, or add information  
directly to the diagram \(Figure 8-3\). Even if you have a  
polished graphic version of the map, keep it open for  
feedback. For instance, create empty rows for people to  
make additions from their own observations.  
Foster discussion  
Prompt the group with directed thought exercises. For  
instance, have them identify moments of truth and dis-  
cuss the relative importance of each touchpoint.  
Tell stories  
Have everyone in the group recount stories from the field  
research. What have they heard people saying at each stage  
in their experience? What evidence can they add? Role-play  
scenarios from the experience to bring them to life.  
Empathy doesn’t come from the diagram itself, but from  
the conversations that create a deeper understanding of an  
experience. As the facilitator, you have to ensure a meaningful  
dialogue happens. I have found it is usually not difficult to get  
people talking, and conversations happen naturally.

around.

Business origami is a specific mapping technique to build empa-  
thy and understanding. It uses physical \(paper\) representations  
of journey map elements that participants can move around in  
a physical space. The aim is to map interactions between the  
various actors, objects, and other service components, as seen  
in Figure 8-4.

210 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Identify Opportunities  
Maps of an experience tell a story in a way that helps you  
uncover opportunities for improvement and innovation. To  
do this, compare the organization’s actions to the individual’s  
experience at each step. Activities to engage a group in iden-  
tifying opportunities include\:  
Identify moments of truth  
Collectively identify the points in the experience that are  
most important to individuals. Give everyone some col-  
ored dot stickers, and have them indicate the most critical  
moments. Discuss the areas that got the most votes.  
Vote on importance to the organization  
Look at what’s valuable to the organization. Use dot vot-  
ing to find the most important points in the experience.  
Rate your own performance  
One of my favorite activities to run is to ask the workshop  
participants to rate how well their product or service sup-  
ports customers at each stage. Using school grades pro-  
vides a familiar scale that most can relate to, or you can  
devise a simple scoring system \(one-to-five or similar\). If  
you are working in multiple groups, compare the ratings  
after you come back together. Discuss the phases that got  
different scores across the groups.  
For instance, Figure 8-5 shows ratings from two separate  
groups working on the same section of a diagram in a work-  
shop I once ran. The scale was 1 to 6, with 1 being the best score and 6 being the worst. At one point the scores between  
breakout groups diverged\: one group gave a 6, while the  
other gave a 3.  
FIGURE 8-5. In this example, rating performance reveals a discrepancy  
between two workshop breakout groups.  
Empathize 211It turned out that some of the members of the group that  
gave a lower rating were closer to actual customer feedback  
at that point. They had just recently uncovered major com-  
plaints and issues that the other group were unaware of. The  
ensuing conversation was enlightening for the whole group,  
building both consensus within the team and empathy for  
the customer.  
These types of activities serve to align  
different views on the optimal points of  
intervention. Strive to make your oppor-  
tunities explicit by highlighting some or  
all of the following aspects\:  
•  
Weaknesses\: Look for points of  
failure. How can you better sup-  
port users? When are their needs  
least satisfied?  
•  
Gaps\: Find where no support is  
offered. What pain points are not  
addressed? What moments of truth  
are potentially overlooked?  
•  
Effort\: Identify the points where  
people have to expend the most  
energy to get to the next step. How  
can you increase or decrease the  
individual’s effort? What can be  
done to provide less friction? •  
Competitors\: Look at what other providers are doing at  
each step in the journey. Where are you underperform-  
ing? When do your competitors provide more satisfy-  
ing experiences?  
Visualizing opportunities on top of the map allows the team  
to take a step back and consider them in the context of the  
organization’s offering. For example, you can add a star  
FIGURE 8-6. A simple pattern emerged from an experience map for authors\: their involvement  
decreased during the production phases.  
212 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve or other icon to the most impactful points of intervention.  
Broader patterns will typically emerge.  
For instance, I once consulted with a publisher to improve  
their relationship with their authors. We noticed a trend  
during the workshop\: the publisher didn’t stay in close con-  
tact with authors after the manuscript was submitted.  
Figure 8-6 shows this pattern overlaid on the map. The bars  
show our relative estimated level of involvement at each  
stage. The team then focused on ways to increase contact  
with authors throughout the journey. How could they make  
authors feel more connected? How could they create a sense  
of belonging?  
Exploring the problem space this way shifted our conversation  
away from attracting new authors and the editing process  
with existing authors to the phases after a manuscript was  
submitted—something the publisher had previously neglect-  
ed. Mapping allows you to better frame and reframe the  
problem to be solved.  
Independent consultant and design sprint master Jay Melone  
leverages mapping in his problem framing method.\* “Problem  
framing helps us validate there’s a problem worth solving,”  
says Melone. His approach has five steps\:  
•  
Problem discovery—Identifying the key problem areas to  
refine in subsequent reframing exercises  
\*  
See Melone’s four-part article on his approach to problem framing, “Problem  
Framing v2\: \(Parts 1-4\),” on the New Haircut blog \(Aug 2018\).  
•  
Business context—Investigating the commercial aspects  
of the business and the business needs  
•  
User perspective—Thoroughly understanding customer  
needs and experiences  
•  
Business-to-user mapping—Aligning the business context  
and user perspective in a unified map  
•  
Problem reframing—Generating a clear and actionable  
problem statement  
The exercises at each of these steps help teams dig deeper  
into understanding the challenges they face and their root  
causes. But the team has to be open to questioning\: are you  
focused on the right problem to be solved? As the facilitator,  
carefully guide the discussion in a productive way to get con-  
sensus. Often this type of introspection leads to a new expres-  
sion of the problem statement, also called a point of view.  
Melone recommends explicitly focusing on four elements to  
include in the reframed problem statement\:  
•  
Who is having the problem?  
•  
What is the problem about?  
•  
When is it happening; aka what is the context?  
•  
Why is it important to solve; will users care?  
To then launch into brainstorming, rephrase the point of view  
as a question. If needed, break the problem up into small-  
er actionable pieces. Here are a few useful techniques to  
explore\:  
Empathize 213How might we…?  
Seeding ideation with clear statements focuses the team  
on finding a specific solution. The language used is  
important\: starting questions with “How might we…”  
provides a sense of safety for exploring a range of options  
together without fear of failing. It’s an admission that the  
team doesn’t have the  
answers from the out-  
set but is committed to  
finding them together.  
For example, based on  
the pattern in Figure  
8-6, I asked workshop participants, “How might we bet-  
ter involve authors during each phase of the publishing  
process after they submit their manuscript?”  
What if…?  
Asking “What if…” often focuses the ideation on a specific  
solution direction and can be used to limit brainstorm-  
ing. For example, in the publishing scenario you might  
ask, “What if we focus only on face-to-face contact with  
authors?” The phrase can be used to shift attention as  
well, for example by asking, “What if we leverage alumni  
authors to help new authors?” Putting such constraints on  
the team’s focus encourages them to dig deeper.  
Make it worse first  
Another technique I’ve had success with is to spend some  
time considering how you might exacerbate the problem.  
Once you agree on the point of view, have people individ-  
ually or in groups come up with specific ways to worsen  
the experience. Sharing these ideas with the group is  
engaging and generally leads to laughter. After you have  
a list of ideas, consider how the opposite of those effects  
could be achieved.  
# Innovation often comes without epiphany.  
# Don’t expect to be able to recognize  
# an innovation as such immediately.  
Mapping in general, and  
the alignment workshop in  
particular, ultimately helps  
frame the problem your  
organization is trying to solve  
in a way that is aligned with  
customer needs. The outcome is a shared point of view that  
becomes a springboard to finding solutions that are grounded  
in real-world ­ observations.  
# Envision  
In my experience, diagrams inspire ideas almost instantly.  
Typically, stakeholders are teeming with ways to enhance their  
offering. Ideas pour out after just an initial inspection of a  
diagram. It’s your job as the facilitator to direct their attention  
and focus this energy.  
At this point in the session, move from understanding the cur-  
rent experience to envisioning possible solutions. The process  
is one of “going wide” in terms of ideas and concepts. This  
mode of working is commonly called divergent thinking \(Figure  
8-7\). The aim at this point isn’t to decide on a single solution or  
direction to follow, but to explore the art of the possible.  
214 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Then, set the right expectations with the team. Ensure that  
the transition from empathizing to envisioning happens. Com-  
municate the rules of divergent thinking\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Go for volume. Aim to cover a breadth of ideas. Keep the  
details to a minimum at first. Avoid filtering ideas as you go.  
Withhold judgment. Create a safe place for people to be  
creative. Participants should be comfortable contributing  
ideas, even if they are not fully thought through.  
Build on ideas. Get the group to say “Yes, and…” instead  
of “But…” to ideas as they emerge. Find the underlying  
value of ideas and build on that.  
Find alternatives. Strive to come up with variations and  
alternatives to initial ideas. Don’t discard them too soon.  
Encourage crazy ideas. Refrain from censoring yourself  
during ideation. There will be plenty of opportunities to  
prioritize and evaluate ideas later.  
Be visual. Work on whiteboards and flipcharts to map out  
ideas as they come. Uncover new relationships and con-  
nections as you brainstorm.  
The intent is to protect ideas in their infancy. Create an  
environment that embraces a range of possibilities and that  
recombines ideas to arrive at innovative ones.  
After collecting initial ideas from the group, conduct di-  
rected exercises for more innovative concepts. Two specific

FIGURE 8-7. Begin by exploring different directions and ideas with

approaches I’ve had success with are removing barriers and  
challenging industry assumptions.  
# Remove Barriers  
A particularly good way to spot opportunities for innovation and  
improvement is to look at what’s holding people back in their  
current experience. Identify the obstacles to getting the jobs done  
at each stage in the diagram. Table 8-1 summarizes key types of  
barriers to overcome, with examples and tips on how to identify  
each type.\*  
Be sure to consider emotional and social aspects as well. For  
instance, if you are looking at the experience of attending a  
conference, you may find that people fear embarrassment  
when asking a question of a speaker. How might you over-  
come this emotional and social barrier?  
\*  
This table is adapted from The Innovator’s Guide to Growth by Scott Anthony  
and colleagues. See this book for more on barriers to innovation.  
Envision 215TABLE 8-1. Types of barriers that prevent individuals from getting value.  
Barrier Example Access\: Some experiences are limited to  
specific times or places, or they pose physi-  
cal or cognitive barriers.  
Mobile phones gave access to telephoning  
even on-the-go.  
Smartphones now give access to the inter-  
net and data from anywhere.  
Skill\: People may lack the ability to perform  
a necessary task.  
Computing prior to 1970 was reserved for  
trained users until the graphic user interface  
and mouse came along in 1982.  
Photography in the late 19th century,  
before the Kodak camera simplified taking  
pictures, was a complex art.  
Time\: Interacting with a product or service  
may simply be too time-consuming.  
Prior to eBay, buying and selling collectibles  
was prohibitively time-consuming.  
Money\: People may lack the financial means  
to afford a product or service.  
Airline travel prior to 1970 was only for the  
wealthy.  
Effort\: Improvements come from looking at  
ways to reduce friction.  
Before Uber came along, getting a taxi was  
hit-or-miss, leaving riders standing in the  
cold or rain, and payment required people  
to fumble around through their wallets in  
the back seat of a car.  
216 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve  
How to identify  
Look at the instances in which an individual  
is not able to consume a product or service  
at all. Are they locked out of getting value?  
Having to take many steps in a process is  
a sign that skill may be a barrier. How can  
you make tasks simple enough for anyone  
to complete?  
Look for high dropout rates within a pro-  
cess and assess if lack of time is the root  
cause. What can you do to shorten the  
process?  
Identify points where a service has high  
costs. Ask, how might you offer that same  
service for free?  
Look for ways to reduce the customer’s  
time to task completion and how to remove  
as much friction as possible from the overall  
experience. Challenge Industry Assumptions  
Another source of meaningful change comes from breaking  
the rules. To help foster a disruptive mindset, identify the  
prevailing industry assumptions, or those unwritten rules that  
define an industry, and then challenge them.\*  
First, generate industry assumption statements using  
this formula\:  
Everyone in \<the industry or category\> knows that  
\<assumption\>….  
Have everyone do this individually at first. Go for volume by  
using phases of the experience to uncover additional industry  
assumptions. Then vote on the assumption most relevant to  
your project or problem to be solved. Figure 8-8 shows an  
example of collecting and prioritizing industry assumptions  
during a workshop I once ran.  
After that, think of ways to change or overturn each by  
considering how you’d do the opposite. What can be turned  
upside down? What conventions and clichés can you break?  
What if a step or element was completely eliminated?  
FIGURE 8-8. Challenge industry assumptions in a workshop.  
\*  
For more, see Luke Williams’s book Disrupt, which details a complete approach  
to challenging industry assumptions.  
Envision 217To illustrate, consider these examples of game-changing inno-  
vations and how they broke industry assumptions\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Everyone in the mop category knew that a mop was a  
one-time purchase, until P&G introduced disposable mops  
with the Swiffer.  
Everyone in the airline industry knew passenger seats  
were preassigned, until Southwest made seat selection  
first come, first served.  
Everyone in the car rental busi-  
ness knew you rented by the  
day and had to complete a lot  
of paperwork in person, until  
Zipcar made it possible to book online and pay by the hour.  
Everyone with minor health concerns knew they had to  
be seen by a doctor, until CVS’s MinuteClinics started  
treating a limited number of conditions that don’t require  
a doctor to diagnose.  
To change the game, you have to first know what game  
you’re in. The map provides a backdrop to uncover common  
industry assumptions from the individual’s point of view.  
Inverting or denying common conventions in a market forces  
the team to think outside the box.  
# Diagrams don’t provide answers;  
# they foster conversations.  
# Evaluate  
By this point in the alignment workshop, the team should  
have generated a lot of concepts. That’s just the first step.  
Don’t end there. Instead, integrate evaluation activities directly  
into the workshop. In other words, switch from divergent  
thinking to convergent thinking \(Figure 8-9\).  
Prioritize your ideas, articulate the  
details of each concept, and test  
them quickly for immediate feed-  
back.

FIGURE 8-9. After divergent thinking, converge ideas into concepts and  
prioritize them.  
218 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Prioritize  
Use the “feasibility versus value” matrix for an initial prioritiza-  
tion, as shown in Figure 8-10. On one axis, consider how easy  
an idea is to implement, or its feasibility . On the other, consid-  
er its impact on the individual’s experience. Use the map and  
your identification of opportunities to help assess impact.  
The aim is to sort the output of ideation into these quadrants.  
Once sorted, you can then do subsequent prioritization within  
each quadrant. Additionally, when the feasibility of an idea is low  
\(i.e., that concept is harder to implement\), you can find ways to  
move it up the matrix by either changing it to be easier to imple-  
ment, considering alternative ways to implement it, or both.  
Figure 8-11 shows an example of a prioritization matrix from  
a workshop I once conducted. We used a window for the  
matrix grid. We quickly identified five high-impact ideas that  
the engineering team could implement immediately—literally  
the next day—with no extra funding or resources.  
After finding the quick wins, move to the ideas that are of  
high value but are harder to implement. These generally take  
planning, design, and development effort. Select the concepts  
to develop further that have the most potential and that peo-  
ple feel passionate about. Have a product owner make these  
selections, or do dot voting to get group consensus.

Evaluate 219Articulate  
Innovation often comes without epiphany. Don’t expect to be  
able to recognize an innovation as such immediately. You’ll  
have to first develop your ideas iteratively. Focus on light-  
weight artifacts that represent each concept, but leave them  
open to interpretation and learning.  
As quickly as possible, articulate the concept you want feed-  
back on. Within just a few hours, you can create representa-  
tions of your leading ideas for evaluation. The resulting arti-  
facts help “debug” your thinking and can prove or disprove  
the value of an idea quickly. Here are a few techniques\:  
Write scenarios  
Write out the details of a concept in  
prose. Be as detailed as possible in terms  
of the anticipated experience. Even the  
simplest of concepts can easily lead to  
multiple pages of text. Let others read  
and critique it.  
Create storyboards  
Represent the intended experience in a  
series of graphic panels. Then critique  
the idea as a group. Figure 8-12 shows  
an example of a simple storyboard cre-  
ated during a workshop. In this case,  
we decided to put one concept on hold  
based on this initial assessment.  
Draw a flowchart  
Quickly express your idea as steps in a flowchart. This  
will help you make connections and see all of the moving  
parts at once.  
Sketch ideas  
Quickly draw an image of the product or service to share  
with others.  
Wireframe solutions  
Create simple versions of screens that outline the pro-  
posed interaction \(Figure 8-13\).  
FIGURE 8-12. Storyboards represent ideas visually with fairly low effort to test concepts.  
220 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Build a low-fidelity prototype  
With online tools such as InVision, it’s easy to create sim-  
ple prototypes of software in a matter of hours. Show  
just enough to be able to get feedback on a key flow.  
Even physical products can be prototyped in a day-long  
workshop. For instance, in one workshop I conducted, we  
tested an idea for improving the shipping experience for  
a large ecommerce website. We went to the local postal  
supply store, bought a box with the approximate dimen-  
sions we needed, and mocked it up to look like we had  
envisioned it. This was then used to get immediate feed-  
back from potential customers.  
FIGURE 8-13. Wireframes created during an alignment workshop quickly  
bring ideas to life.  
# Concept Feedback  
Get feedback on your concepts as quickly as possible, even  
during the workshop. This will not be controlled, rigorous  
research, but instead serves as a quick way to understand  
your assumptions about an ideal solution. Does your concept  
address the problem in the right way? Are you moving in the  
right direction?  
To refine your evaluation with feedback from potential end  
users, try some of these lightweight techniques\:  
“Hallway” testing  
Get feedback from people close by who are not part  
of the workshop. Colleagues in other departments, for  
instance, can provide quick initial reactions to your con-  
cepts. In remote settings, have colleagues who weren’t  
workshop participants give feedback on your concepts via  
teleconferencing.  
Online tests  
There are many online services that provide feedback on  
concepts and prototypes—for example, Usertesting.com.  
You’ll usually get results within a matter of hours.  
Focus groups  
Recruit people in advance of the workshop to give direct  
feedback. Present the concepts to a small focus group of  
two or three people and watch how they react.  
Evaluate 221Think-aloud interviews  
Ask participants to think aloud in moderated sessions  
as they interact with your prototype or artifact. As with  
focus groups, you have to recruit participants in advance.  
Figure 8-14 shows a concept test during a workshop I  
once led. The tests were conducted in a separate room,  
viewable by the workshop team via video camera.  
Hold team discussions on the feedback you gather. Decide if  
changes are needed or if the concept needs to be discarded  
entirely. Either way, be sure that you integrate the learning  
from the evaluation rounds into your thinking.  
The overall aim at this point is to first understand the prob-  
lem you are solving, then—using the artifacts created in the  
workshop \(storyboard, diagrams, concepts, etc.\)—get rapid  
feedback on the concept you’ve come up with. You want  
to have confidence you’re solving the right problem before  
developing a full-fledged solution.

potential solution users.  
Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Presumptive Design Aligns Teams on the Problem to Be Solved  
by Leo Frishberg  
# CASE STUDY  
As a UX strategist, whether within product teams or as an  
outside consultant, I’ve observed organizations failing to drive  
problem validation with as much nuance and sophistication as  
they drive solution development. What if we could apply the  
same kinds of processes we use in executing our work \(agile,  
iterative experiments\) in our strategy and problem validation  
work? How might we “experiment” with strategy  
before we spend resources executing on it?  
I and my coauthor Charles Lambdin wrote Pre-  
sumptive Design\: Design Provocations for Inno-  
vation to address those questions. Presumptive  
Design \(PrD\) is a design-based research method  
focused on validating problems, whether at the  
strategic or feature level. It starts with crafting  
artifacts that embody the problem \(the creation  
session\).  
Teams then take those artifacts to users who  
\(presumably\) suffer from the problem. In these  
evaluation sessions, users attempt to address the  
problem using the artifact. Within a few sessions,  
the team learn what users’ real problems are and  
pivot, repeating the process until they are satisfied  
they’ve identified a problem worth solving.  
At the UXStrat 2015 conference in Athens, Georgia, Charles,  
Jim, and I had an opportunity to apply PrD in a paired workshop  
engagement \(Figure 8-15\). In Jim’s workshop on experience  
mapping, attendees created a map that embodied a presumed  
strategic problem\: a hypothetical city’s tourism bureau believed  
revitalizing its website would improve its mission and outreach.  
FIGURE 8-15. UXStrat15 attendees evaluating a map to provide immediate feedback on  
a proposed concept.  
Case Study\: Presumptive Design Aligns Teams on the Problem to Be Solved﻿ 223CASE STUDY  
In our sister workshop immediately afterward, attendees offered  
their maps to potential travelers to evaluate with a simple prompt\:  
“Please imagine you are taking a trip. Using the diagram, indicate  
the steps you would take to plan your trip.”  
Within the span of these two brief workshops, the tourism office got  
actionable feedback on its web revitalization strategy\: don’t do it!  
The website wasn’t the problem. Instead, the bureau would better  
serve its mission by looking at other parts of the visitor’s experience.  
Overall, PrD is a twist on the usual user-centered design approach.  
Rather than starting your design process with a research effort,  
PrD begins by crafting artifacts for users to react to—whether a  
journey map, a sketch, or a model made from pipe cleaners. Those  
artifacts then become the focus on your experimental inquiry to  
validate the right problems to solve.  
PrD aligns teams on the right problem to solve by\:  
1\. Engaging leadership and internal stakeholders in crafting “solu-  
tions” that embody their assumptions. In the UXStrat15 example,  
the tourism office assumed it needed to revamp its website.  
2\. Quickly getting the internal team’s presumptions \(assumptions,  
problem statements, possible solutions\) in front of stakeholders  
who matter \(key customers or users\). In the UXStrat15 exam-  
ple, actual travelers diverged from the teams’ maps in ways that  
showed the original strategy was flawed.  
3\. Reducing the impact of the HiPPO \(highest paid person’s opinion\)  
on problem validation. Even if the design team knows the proposed  
approach is wrong, PrD rapidly captures data the team needs to  
illustrate to what extent and in what ways it is wrong.  
4\. Increasing the team’s understanding of the problem space  
\(“unknown unknowns”\) through a series of iterative experiments.

224 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve Facilitating an Alignment ­ Workshop  
Diagrams don’t provide answers; they foster conversations.  
As the facilitator of the workshop, it’s your job to make those  
conversations happen. Whether in person or working with a  
remote team, your role begins with careful preparation, then  
moves into moderating the session, and continues with a  
strong follow-up.  
# 1\. Prepare  
Organize the alignment workshop well in advance. In many  
organizations, getting people to commit for a whole day or  
multiple days is difficult. Include the workshop in your initial  
proposal, and schedule the  
event early on—even before  
you’ve started creating the  
diagram. The workshop is part  
of the mapping process.  
# The alignment workshop is an  
# inclusive activity, so plan to invite a  
# range of stakeholders with different  
# functions in your organization.  
An alignment workshop can  
be conducted in person or  
with distributed participants.  
I recommend avoiding a mix of remote and in-person partici-  
pation\: it’s very difficult to balance the interaction in a hybrid  
situation. Either all in person or all remote is best.  
Think about the environment you’re creating for the discus-  
sion. For in-person workshops, it’s preferable to secure a  
space outside of the normal workplace to avoid distractions. I  
prefer an oversized room to allow for a lot of movement.  
In-person sessions can typically be scheduled for an entire  
day, or even span multiple days. For remote workshops, consid-  
er splitting the workshop into smaller chunks of time; for exam-  
ple, instead of one eight-hour session, schedule two four-hour  
sessions on consecutive days for better engagement.  
Plan for breaks, catering, and social activities. For instance,  
planning a lunch outside of the workshop room can refresh  
the group and help keep them focused in the second half.  
Good facilitation also involves having the right tools, materi-  
als, and workflow. Consider all the details that go into creat-  
ing the workshop experience for participants.  
The alignment workshop is an  
inclusive activity, so plan to  
invite a range of stakeholders  
with different functions in your  
organization. The aim is to get  
broad buy-in and input from  
diverse perspectives, including  
industry experts from outside  
the organization. From this standpoint, remote sessions are  
advantageous because they typically open up participation to  
colleagues who might not be able to travel. Groups of 6–12  
participants work best, although larger groups are possible.  
Facilitating an Alignment ­ Workshop 225Assign roles and clarify what’s expected from everyone up  
front. This is particularly important for remote sessions. Some  
key roles are\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Facilitator\: This is the person moderating the workshop,  
who ideally is also the mapmaker, but may have cofacilita-  
tors helping guide the session.  
Breakout-group leaders\: If you plan to break out into  
smaller groups, enlist one person per group to keep the  
discussion moving and the team on task.  
Decision makers\: Include senior stakeholders to be able to  
make business decisions in terms of resources or funding,  
as well as to serve as a tiebreaker if needed.  
Designers\: Include designers and others that can help  
articulate the envisioned concepts.  
Industry experts\: Consider introducing outside voices into  
the workshop, and point out their role to everyone else in  
advance.  
Test moderator\: Also include someone who can moderate  
user tests, if needed.  
Contributors\: This encompasses everyone else in  
the group.  
Plan an agenda for the workshop to mirror the desired shape  
of the interaction, as outlined earlier in the chapter. It’s OK  
to improvise and go off schedule, but having an agenda will  
keep the session on track. When working with distributed  
teams, consider how you can have work done asynchronously  
both before and after the real-time session to maximize the  
efficiency of your time together.  
Keep the desired outcomes of the session in mind to guide  
the flow\: understand the experience \(empathize\), explore  
solutions based on the insights you prioritize \(envision\), and  
select a direction to pursue moving forward \(evaluate\). The  
key is to move through all three modes of working during the  
session to ensure you’ll meet your goals. Figure 8-16 shows  
what a day-long workshop might look like at a high level.  
It’s also possible to run multi-day workshops, as shown in  
Figures 8-17 and 8-18. The intent is to move through the  
three modes of thinking—empathizing, envisioning, and eval-  
uating—several times before deciding on which solutions to  
move forward with in experiments in the next phase.  
For remote groups, you might split a day-long workshop into  
two separate half-day sessions. When working with distribut-  
ed teams, break these components up into smaller sessions,  
such as four two-hour sessions. Also try to assign more  
pre-work and post-work for remote workshops to make your  
real-time sessions more efficient  
I recommend holding a short call a week before the alignment  
workshop to kick off before the session begins. Distribute  
materials, introduce everyone to one another, and set expec-  
tations during the call to get some of the housekeeping out of  
the way in advance. Assign pre-work to accelerate the agenda  
of the main session and get people thinking about the topic  
before they show up.

Facilitating an Alignment ­ Workshop 2272\. Run the Workshop  
Once assembled as a group, set expectations. Review the  
shape of the workshop again with the team and be sure to let  
them know that follow-up work will be required. The conver-  
sation does not end with this workshop—it’s ongoing.  
After a warm-up exercise, focus on the experience represent-  
ed in your diagram. The map should be the centerpiece of  
the session. Then follow the format outlined above of moving  
from empathizing with the experience to exploring concepts  
to evaluating them\:  
•  
Understand the current experience. Start with exercises  
that help people internalize, such as having them read  
through and assess the experiences people currently have.  
•  
Facilitate divergent thinking. Brainstorming is the principal  
way to generate new ideas. Use the diagram as a spring-  
board for ideation with some of the techniques discussed  
in this chapter.  
•  
Create artifacts. Sketch, draw, and prototype your ideas  
quickly. The space you’re using should look more like a  
project war room than a boardroom. Alignment work-  
shops are working sessions.  
•  
Select concepts. Focus on ideas that have high value to  
customers and to the organization.  
•  
Run tests. Quickly evaluate the leading concepts, out-  
lined above.  
Additionally, plan social activities. In many cases, the group of  
people you bring together may never have worked together  
before. For in-person sessions, include a social event such  
as an evening dinner. When working remotely, schedule a  
team-building exercise into the agenda. It’s important for con-  
tinued collaboration that people get to know one another on  
a personal level. This helps build trust and respect, which goes  
a long way toward the success of the effort.  
# 3\. Follow Up  
An alignment workshop is a creative endeavor that results in  
actionable outcomes. Alignment activities do not end with the  
workshop. Make sure that you keep the momentum going af-  
ter the session has ended. Consider ways to continue working  
with the team, and share the results of your effort\:  
•  
Get feedback on the session. Follow up with a brief sur-  
vey on the effort itself. This can be done verbally at the  
end of the workshop or by a short online survey. The  
intent is to learn how you can improve this type of effort  
in the future.  
•  
Update the diagram. Take the feedback you get from  
the session and update the diagram. Include on it the  
additions and comments others made. You can also map  
other outcomes from the diagram.  
•  
Distribute materials. Collate the output of the work-  
shop and distribute it to others who didn’t participate.  
Schedule a meeting to present the workshop results to a  
wider group of stakeholders.  
228 Chapter 8\: Alignment Workshops\: Find the Right Problem to Solve •  
Make the diagrams visible. Create different forms of the  
diagram and make them visible. Print out large copies for  
the office space. Create flyers or handouts of the diagram  
that colleagues can keep by their desks. Integrate it into  
presentations and other documents internally. If working  
online, distribute a PDF of the diagram or link to your map  
throughout your communications with the team.  
You also need to ensure that the planned experiments are  
actually conducted, as discussed in the next chapter. Keep the  
momentum going with an action plan and assigned owners  
for each experiment. Hold weekly checkpoints to track prog-  
ress if needed.  
# Summary  
A diagram is a means to an end—to get team alignment  
around the experience. But diagrams don’t provide the an-  
swers; instead, they spark conversations. They are like camp-  
fires that people gather around to share stories and to make  
sense of the experiences they create.  
In this stage of the process, your role switches from research-  
er and mapmaker to facilitator . The goal is twofold\: align the  
internal perspective of the organization to the outside world,  
and use that insight to generate new ideas. In an alignment  
workshop you’ll alternate between three modes of activity\:  
empathizing, envisioning, and evaluating.  
Think of a diagram as a prototype of an experience. It allows  
team members to put themselves in the user’s shoes. In the  
alignment workshop, first read through the diagram together  
and assess your performance at each stage. Then find oppor-  
tunities by looking at weaknesses, gaps, and redundancies, as  
well as where competitors perform well. Diagrams help you  
frame the right problems to solve.  
Envision possible solutions. Select ideas with the most po-  
tential and represent them in some way. This can be done  
quickly with scenarios, storyboards, and wireframes. Use  
these artifacts to get input from others. Evaluate the results,  
and iterate.  
Even within a single-day workshop you can run lightweight  
tests. Invite a few outsiders to critique storyboards and  
sketches, for instance. Iterate as many times as possible, and  
plan to continue iterating after the workshop. If you’re work-  
ing with a remote group, break the sessions up into smaller  
chunks and do testing or get customer feedback in between  
your meeting times.  
Running a workshop is not an easy task—it requires a lot of  
planning. And alignment doesn’t stop with the diagram, or  
with the workshop. After you generate excitement, consider  
how to keep the momentum going. The next chapter discuss-  
es how to move into planning and eventually development.

provides a good overview for running workshops.

# CASE STUDY  
Working with multiple stakeholders is a challenge. They may  
each have a different vision of the world driven by their individ-  
ual goals and perspectives, whether coming from engineering,  
business, or public policy backgrounds.  
We Design Services \(WDS\), a leading service innovation firm,  
developed the customer journey mapping game to facilitate  
communication in such complex environments. The game uses  
the customer journey as a catalyst for team interaction.  
While several configurations of the game are possible, a typical  
process has the following steps\:  
1\. Prepare the game. Before the game session, create a blank  
journey worksheet with swim lanes for relevant touchpoints  
and information types. Then furnish a set of cards representing  
possible touchpoints. These will vary depending on the domain  
and situation involved.  
2\. Select personas. Start the game by having the participants  
choose a persona. Ask, “Whose journey are you going  
to map?”  
3\. Set goals. Define a goal for this persona. What is the overall  
need? What are they trying to get done?  
4\. Add touchpoints. Then, for the selected persona, place the  
touchpoints in the order they might experience them. Do this  
step as a team.  
5\. Reflect. Find patterns in the experience across the different  
touchpoints. Where are there gaps and problems? Where are  
the emotional highs and lows? Where are there opportunities  
for the organization?  
6\. Repeat. Select a different persona or change the goals, and  
repeat the process. How do the journeys differ? What are com-  
mon patterns across them? How would extreme users experi-  
ence the touchpoints?  
We piloted this technique for a major French city that wanted  
to gather stakeholders for a co-creation exercise. The goal was  
to reinvent urban transportation.  
This project was a challenge because of the widely different  
perspectives of the different people around the table \(Figure  
8-19\). As well as users of the system, there were participants  
from car manufacturing companies, large commercial firms,  
public transit companies, and labor unions.

Case Study\: Customer Journey Mapping Game﻿ 233CASE STUDY  
Introducing this new methodology allowed us to develop a com-  
mon language shared by everyone and dominated by no one. This lan-  
guage helped identify shared value among the different stakeholders.  
This initial workshop confirmed that mapping the user journey  
as a group is an efficient way to visualize common touchpoints,  
interests, and ways to create value. It proved to be eye-opening  
for participants.  
In this case, participants reported an increased sense of team  
alignment and cross-functional collaboration, in general, after our  
workshops. Unfortunately, this technique is rarely used by local  
governments looking to reenergize their local ecosystems.  
The underlying problem is siloed thinking. The journey mapping  
game breaks down those departmental barriers and allows compa-  
nies to think holistically and collaboratively.  
We tested our approach with other companies and have invariably  
found that aligning disparate points of view allows them to uncov-  
er new business opportunities.  
The customer journey mapping game was originally developed by  
Christophe Tallec and Paul Kahn. Figure 8-20 shows an example of a  
customer journey game board and its elements. Tallec and Kahn also  
created an online version of the journey game; you can access the  
template at http\://prezi.com/1qu6lq4qucsm/customer-journey-map-

# Envisioning Future Experiences\:  
# Build the Right Solution  
In the preface, I urged you to empathize with the people you  
serve. The way to do this is clear\: view your offering from  
the outside in rather than the inside out. It’s also important  
to develop empathy before conceiving new solutions. Dis-  
tinguish gaining empathy from applying empathy as an act  
of ­ compassion.  
I’ve experienced this trap in the past. At a prior company I  
worked for, for example, a small team spent two months be-  
hind closed doors developing a new concept that helped peo-  
ple plan events. They had no contact with potential ­ customers.  
To anyone who already had close contact with our target  
users it was immediately clear this solution had serious flaws.  
It didn’t address actual users’ needs, and it didn’t match their  
mental model. Despite the team’s passion, their fully fledged  
product concept was doomed from the outset. They could  
have spent their time more wisely if they had better defined  
the problem to solve first. Note that I am not advocating big  
up-front research. It need not take long, and mapping helps  
teams develop a common understanding of an individual’s  
experience and frame the problem. For this reason, this book  
has so far focused on current state visualizations—diagrams  
of the world as it exists today.  
But after gaining empathy and tying that to the right opportu-  
nities to target, you then have to design concrete solutions to  
implement. This is all part of your role as the mapmaker—it’s  
not just about doing the research and creating a diagram. You  
also have to plan for a strong follow-through into the solu-  
tion space.  
This chapter discusses some ways to make mapping action-  
able. First, run the experiments that were planned at the end  
of the alignment workshop. Then, consider how to design fu-  
ture experiences with storylines, design maps, and user story  
mapping. Finally, devise ways to keep the mapping effort alive  
and ongoing—empathizing with customers should never end.  
237Run Experiments  
Creating new value brings uncertainty. Although you may al-  
ready have gotten some initial feedback on your ideas during  
the alignment workshop, you still don’t know how the market  
will react to the proposed innovation in the proposed context  
of use.  
It’s important to set the right expectations with your team  
and stakeholders coming out of an alignment workshop. The  
results aren’t implementation-ready ideas, but instead hy-  
potheses that need testing. There is still a lot of work needed  
to flesh out your leading concepts and prove their business  
viability with experiments.  
Start by creating explicit hypothesis statements for each of the  
concepts you’ve decided to move forward with. Structurally,  
there are three parts to these statements\:  
We believe that providing \[solution, service\] for \[indi-  
vidual, customer, user\]  
will likely result in \[desired outcome, assumed effect\],  
and we will know this when we see \[result, measur-  
able impact\].  
Notice that the hypothesis is phrased as a belief . You won’t  
know the actual impact until you introduce it to the market.  
Also note that if there is not a measurable outcome, you don’t  
have a testable hypothesis. Be sure to include a metric.  
Next, create a plan of experiments to be conducted over  
the following weeks. Some specific approaches include  
the following\:  
•  
Explanatory video. Create a video explaining your service  
and circulate it on the internet. Measure interest via traffic  
and response rates.  
•  
Landing page. Creating a landing page \(sometimes called  
a “fake storefront”\) announcing the fictitious launch of  
your proposed service.  
•  
Prototype testing. Simulate a functioning version of your  
concept. Test this with potential customers and measure  
concrete aspects such as task completion and satisfaction.  
•  
Concierge service. Start with a simulated version of your  
service. Invite a very limited set of potential customers to  
sign up, and then provide the service manually.  
•  
Limited product release. Create a version of your service  
with only one or two functioning features. Measure the  
success and appeal of those features.  
Combinations of the above are also possible. Those familiar  
with the current literature on “Lean” techniques will recog-  
nize some of these approaches. For more on defining and  
running market experiments, see Eric Ries’s Lean Startup, Ash  
Maurya’s Running Lean, and Lean UX by Jeff Gothelf and  
Joshua Seiden.  
The point is that you need to have prior commitment to  
follow through after the workshop. For instance, I once con-  
ducted a multi-day alignment workshop that started with an  
238 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution exploration of an experience map. We easily generated dozens  
of ideas that we prioritized and narrowed down to a few that  
got further developed and tested quickly during the session.  
One of the participants of the workshop was a project man-  
ager, who focused on creating a project plan of experiments  
to be conducted. We also secured some time to continue  
working on the concepts afterward. So, instead of ending the  
workshop with only concepts and rough proto-  
types, we also had a plan to move forward with  
additional experimentation and the resources to  
do so.  
For one of the leading concepts, the project team  
enlisted a professional graphic artist to create a  
storyboard. This was then made into a video with  
a voice-over audio track. In creating both the  
storyboard and the video, the original concept  
morphed and expanded. By simply fleshing it out,  
we learned a lot and made changes.  
Then we put the video on the landing page,  
where visitors could also sign up to be noti-  
fied about a beta release \(Figure 9-1\). Those  
who signed up were presented with a short  
three-question survey. Some of the parts we’d  
thought would be most beneficial got a cool  
reception by visitors to the page, and other parts  
we hadn’t emphasized received more attention.  
We adjusted our priorities and modified the con-  
cept accordingly. From these touchpoints we were able to measure traffic  
to the website over a given period of time, the number of  
signups, and responses to our survey. We also spoke with se-  
lected individuals to better understand their motivations and  
what excited them about our value proposition. In the end,  
SnapSupport morphed into something different than it had  
started out as in the workshop.  
FIGURE 9-1. SnapSupport began as a concept video and landing page to test market  
reactions to the idea before a working prototype was even built.  
Run Experiments 239Michael Schrage offers a formal method for proving business  
value through experiments he calls the 5x5 technique. The  
idea is to take five teams of five people each and give them  
five days to come up with a series of experiments. Then, each  
team gets \$5,000 and five weeks to run their experiments.  
The purpose of such experiments is not to launch a product,  
service, or feature, but to learn about which solutions address  
your problem best. Often, small tests can provide insights  
that have big impacts. So not only does your role switch from  
mapmaker to facilitator, but you also have to be responsible  
for making sure the right follow-through motions are in place.  
# Ideas Are Overrated  
Generating ideas is fun—addictive, even. I should know\:  
working as a design lead, I’ve facilitated many ideation  
sessions in my career. You could say I’m an ideaholic of sorts.  
You’ve probably experienced this, too\: a team gets together  
for a few hours or days to brainstorm ideas. “Go for volume,”  
they’re instructed. In the end, there may be hundreds of ideas  
on the workshop room wall \(Figure 9-2\). And success is tacitly  
measured by the number of sticky notes used.  
But the volume of ideas is rarely the problem. I’ve never come  
across an organization that doesn’t have enough ideas. In fact,  
most are swimming in ideas they don’t know how to act on.  
Yet, we continue to engage in exercises that add more and  
more ideas to the pile.  
Part of the problem is an erroneous Darwinistic view of the  
idea lifecycle. We assume that the best concepts will simply rise  
to the surface on their merit. If you can just collect enough of  
them, so the logic goes, the chances of a few of them surviving  
will increase mathematically.  
But that’s not how most organizational decision making works.  
The best ideas don’t just emerge from the pile. Instead, natural  
forces within any organization act to keep ideas down, re-  
gardless of whether they’re good or not. Chief among these is  
uncertainty, a leading idea antibody within enterprises.  
Simply put, new concepts represent a gamble to risk managers,  
even if they are well expressed in a high-fidelity prototype.  
Many ideas seem great at the time we have them. “This is it!  
We’re going to save the company!” we think with confidence.  
But when hard decisions need to be made and those innocent  
ideas hit reality, even the best ones wither quickly.  
240 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution Good ideas overpromise and underdeliver. They  
distract our energy away from the “ugly duck-  
ling” ideas that could turn into swans, if given  
the attention.  
Part of the problem is that it’s difficult \(if not  
impossible\) to recognize a great idea in its infancy.  
We assume there will be some “aha” moment  
when everything just feels right. But what does  
innovation feel like? How do you know you’re on  
to something big?  
The history of innovation shows that even the most  
profound, life-changing innovations often weren’t  
recognizable as such at first. As Scott Berkun  
reminds us in his book The Myths of Innovation,  
most innovations come without epiphanies.  
Take the Wright brothers’ first flight. There were  
only a handful of people watching the historic  
event, and it took them six years to even sell the  
first airplane. No one foresaw a multibillion-dollar  
industry stemming from their invention.  
We’re obsessed with the origin of ideas, but we  
need to consider where ideas end up in organiza-  
tions as much as where they come from. We must  
be honest about the natural lifecycle of ideas and  
how the organization moves forward.  
FIGURE 9-2. It’s easy to generate a lot of ideas, but that shouldn’t be the end of  
your work.  
Run Experiments 241The point is that it’s up to you to set the right expectations.  
This starts with an admission that an idea on a sticky note is  
just the beginning of a long iterative process. You won’t go  
from sticky notes on the workshop room wall directly to imple-  
mentation, and generating cash flow from your idea may take  
several years.  
Of course, organizations strive to shorten the long nose of in-  
novation. But innovation is a process of continuous reinvention  
at all levels\: conceptual, technical, and business development.  
Luckily, there are some fairly simple things you can do to keep  
the momentum going\:  
•  
Manage ideation as an ongoing project. Invite a project  
manager to your ideation or brainstorming session.  
After participating in the action, their primary function  
is then to break down the outcomes into actionable  
steps. Have them create a plan for the continued devel-  
opment of ideas as they emerge.  
•  
Aim for experiments as outcomes. Make experiments  
the result of your alignment workshop. This takes some  
humility, but sets the right expectations.  
•  
Make small bets. Avoid only aiming for breakthrough  
innovation. Sure, everybody wants to create the next  
iPod for their industry—but bigger isn’t always better.  
Instead, make a lot of small bets. You don’t know how  
big an idea will turn out to be.  
•  
•  
Commit resources before you start. Get a commitment  
for continued experimentation in advance, even before  
you start generating ideas. Line up small teams who’ll  
have dedicated time to conduct experiments. Clarify the  
budget in advance as well. A cheap experiment may  
only take four to eight weeks to complete and require a  
budget of a few thousand dollars.  
Conduct cheap tests. Be prepared to reinvent over  
and over again. After getting and acting on real-world  
feedback, your original idea may not even resemble the  
initial concept.  
Long Live Ideas!  
All of this is not to say you shouldn’t do any free-form brain-  
storming. Generating ideas is a healthy part of the employee  
experience, bringing people together and providing a safe  
forum to exercise creative muscles.  
The point is to keep in mind that the ideas themselves are over-  
rated. Business decisions don’t get made based on a sketch.  
Instead, set realistic expectations and be prepared to prove  
your ideas from a business standpoint if you want a chance of  
succeeding.  
242 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution Design the New Experience  
# with Maps  
Mapping is a key way to capture observations from the real  
world and represent them visually. But mapping can also be a  
generative technique to describe the experience of new solu-  
tions, particularly in more complex or overarching experiential  
contexts. Teams need to see the end-to-end experience so  
they can design products and services that fit in, even if they  
are not in control of all of the parts.  
There are several techniques that draw on a mapping mindset  
that you can apply to get a grasp of the overall experience.  
These include to-be mapping, storylines, design maps, and  
user story mapping.  
# To-Be Mapping, or Target State  
# ­ Blueprinting  
As mentioned, this book focuses on as-is maps\: understand-  
ing an experience as it currently exists to provide empathy  
and understanding, which leads to identifying opportunities.  
At some point, however, you’ll want to consider to-be maps,  
also called future state maps or target state blueprints, among  
other terms.  
As the name suggests, the future state map outlines the expe-  
rience of a solution that doesn’t yet exist. Unlike current state  
maps, future state maps aren’t based on research. Instead,  
they represent a vision of a potential experience and serve as  
a communication tool for a team building a new service of  
some kind.  
There are a couple of ways to map future experiences. I often  
try to avoid creating a separate diagram. Instead, it’s frequent-  
ly possible to include future experiences within the current  
state map—for example, at the bottom of a diagram \(see Fig-  
ure 9-3\). This highlights the transition needed to move from  
the present to the future. Both cause and cure are captured in  
one place.  
Sometimes, however, the future state will represent a differ-  
ent flow of interactions, and the chronology of steps is dif-  
ferent. For instance, a map of a taxi-riding experience would

Design the New Experience with Maps 243have a different chronology than using Uber. With Uber, the  
payment method is determined before riding, the destination  
is given to the driver before the rider gets in the car, and tips  
are given much later. In this case, envisioning this future state  
would be best represented in a entirely separate diagram.  
IBM’s Enterprise Design Thinking toolkit includes a specific ex-  
ercise to create a to-be scenario map. According to the web-  
site \(https\://www.ibm.com/services/business/design-thinking\),  
it’s intended to be a draft of a vision of the user’s future  
experience to show how ideas address their current needs.  
First, draw four rows and label them “Phases,” “Doing,”  
“Thinking,” and “Feeling.” Then, either individually or as a  
group, imagine an ideal experience by filling out the rows  
using sticky notes. Compare the idealized to-be state to the  
current state and find the highs and lows. Where are your  
opportunities? Where is the aha moment that might differen-  
tiate your solution? See the “magical moment” in Figure 9-4.  
# Storylines  
Storytelling is not only a means of communicating a vision—it  
helps make sense of complex problems. According to digital  
product strategist Donna Lichaw, author of The User’s Jour-  
ney\: Storymapping Products That People Love, you can use  
the principles of storytelling to guide the design of products  
and services.  
To do this, Lichaw uses a structure common to most stories  
called the narrative arc \(Figure 9-5\). This structure can be  
traced back to Aristotle. It is a timeless form used to tell sto-  
ries over thousands of years and across cultures.  
The elements of the narrative arc are\:  
•  
Exposition\: Good stories establish the context and intro-  
duce the characters and situations at the beginning.  
•  
Inciting incident\: This is the point where something goes  
wrong or there is some change to the situation.  
•  
Rising action\: A good story builds over time. Intensity and  
action increase as the story unfolds.  
FIGURE 9-4. IBM’s simple approach to to-be mapping includes identifying  
a target “magical moment” in the intended experience.

FIGURE 9-5. The archetypal narrative arc shows the rise in action before the resolution.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Crisis\: The story culminates at the point of maximum fric-  
tion. This is the point of no return.  
Climax/resolution\: The climax is the most exciting part  
of the story and the point at which the audience realizes  
that all might be well again. This is when the problem  
that was surfaced by the inciting incident is resolved.  
Falling action\: But wait, there’s more! After the climax,  
the story comes back down in action and begins to end.  
End\: This is the very end of the narrative. Typically, there is  
a return back to the original state.  
The point of storylines is not storytelling, but rather building  
products and services as if you are crafting a story. In other  
words, apply the narrative arc to the design process itself.  
To do this, Lichaw recommends first mapping out an ideal  
journey against the narrative. Then you  
design your product or service based on  
that flow.  
Figure 9-6 shows an example of using  
a narrative arc to plan the content of a  
digital service. The intent is to make the  
user’s journey into a dramatic, engaging  
story. The result is a strategy for con-  
tent and features that engagingly meet  
audience needs.  
Applying narrative arcs in design work-  
shops is straightforward. Together with  
Lis Hubert, Lichaw describes the process  
in her article “Storymapping\: A MacGyver Approach to Con-  
tent Strategy”\:  
1\. Hold a workshop with a broad set of stakeholders.  
2\. Draw the user’s journey as a narrative arc on  
a whiteboard.  
3\. Map individual pieces of content users would need at  
each stage.  
4\. Below that, record existing content.  
5\. Identify gaps and weaknesses in the existing content.  
6\. Prioritize and plan a broader content strategy.  
Following these steps results in a content strategy with focus  
and meaning. It aligns teams to a common purpose and yields  
more engaging services in general.

246 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution Aspire to Transform  
Products and services that merely connect, delight, and provide  
positive experiences don’t go far enough. What’s needed is a  
better way to envision users as they may act.  
Enter “The Ask,” a single question outlined by MIT professor  
Michael Schrage in his book Who Do You Want Your Customers  
to Become? Successful innovations, Schrage contends, don’t  
merely ask users to do something different\: they ask them to  
become someone different.  
For example, George Eastman didn’t just invent an affordable,  
easy-to-use automatic camera at the end of the 19th century;  
he created photographers. His innovation allowed everyone to  
do something only trained professionals could previously do.  
Through the lens of The Ask, Google is not just a sophisticated  
search algorithm. It lets everyone become expert researchers.  
Or consider eBay. The popular trading platform has created a  
new breed of entrepreneurs.  
However, innovations that ask people to become something  
they don’t want to become typically fail. Take the Segway.  
What does it ask us to become? A mad, helmeted scientist  
racing down the sidewalk? Or an authority figure \(e.g., a police  
officer\) extending a few feet above other pedestrians? Or may-  
be just a weirdo on a scooter \(Figure 9-7\)?  
McDonald’s “super size” cam-  
paign is another example. From  
a business standpoint it was  
very effective. For a few extra  
cents in cost to the organization,  
customers got what appeared  
to be a good deal. But it asked  
them to become unhealthy . That  
ended up hurting the reputation  
of the company.  
Table 9-1 summarizes the  
preceding examples. It shows  
the transformative effects  
these products and services  
had on people, both positive  
and ­ negative.  
FIGURE 9-7. The Segway  
asks us to become someone  
we don’t want to.  
TABLE 9-1. A summary of the transformations selected innovative  
products and services had on people, both positive and negative.  
Kodak = Camera \> Photographers  
Google = Search engine \> Expert researchers  
eBay = Trading platform \> Entrepreneurs  
but…  
Segway = New vehicle \> Weirdos on scooters  
Super size = Value for money \> Unhealthy people  
Design the New Experience with Maps 247Here is how to apply The Ask to alignment diagrams\:  
•  
At each major division in the diagram pose the ques-  
tion, “Who do we want our customers to become?”  
•  
•  
•  
Collect potential answers and decide which is best.  
Continue for each major division of the diagram.  
Finally, brainstorm solutions.  
For example, Figure 9-8  
shows the service blueprint  
from the previous chap-  
ter, created by Brandon  
Schauer. Overlaid on top of  
it are hypothetical answers  
to The Ask at each phase in  
the journey.  
The Ask opens the door for truly aspirational thinking and  
transformative innovation. It starts with the outcome, not the  
solution. Brainstorming around outcomes generally yields new  
ideas that stand out from previous exercises in the align-  
ment workshop.

248 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution Design Maps  
Design maps are simple diagrams of an ideal experience  
created by a team. The technique is described by Tamara  
Adlin and Holly Jamesen Carr in Chapter 10 of the book The  
Persona Lifecycle.  
Creating a design map is a simple practice that requires only  
sticky notes and a whiteboard. The result is a map of an ideal  
future experience. There are four basic elements in the map,  
each with a different color note\:  
•  
Steps\: Blue notes denote the steps a given persona takes  
in a process.  
•  
Comments\: Green notes provide more details about each  
action, including thoughts, feelings, and pain points.  
•  
Questions\: Yellow notes capture questions a team has  
about the experience. They highlight gaps in knowledge  
and assumptions about the proposed experience.  
•  
Ideas\: Pink notes are used to capture ideas on how to  
provide a better service.  
Figure 9-9 shows an example of a design map for a fictitious  
app. The steps, in blue, form the basis of the chronology  
across the top of the map. Comments, questions, and ideas  
appear below each step, forming an interlocking grid of  
sticky notes.  
Adlin and Carr recommended using design maps asynchro-  
nously. The idea is to place a map in a common office area  
and invite colleagues to contribute to it individually. Over the  
FIGURE 9-9. An example of a design map, modeled after the technique outlined in The Persona Lifecycle.  
Design the New Experience with Maps 249course of days or weeks, team members can add questions  
and ideas as they come to mind. The map thus grows organi-  
cally over time.  
Design maps can also be used in workshops to envision a fu-  
ture experience. For instance, I once used this technique in an  
alignment workshop with three breakout groups. First, each  
group created an ideal flow of steps  
for one of the three experiences we  
were targeting. They also added  
comments to describe the steps in  
greater detail.  
Then, I rotated the groups so that  
they were each working with anoth-  
er group’s design map. They read  
the steps and comments on the new  
design map and posed questions  
about each step on different-colored  
sticky notes.  
Finally, I rotated the groups once  
more. After they had read all of the  
steps, comments, and questions of  
the preceding groups, their task was  
to brainstorm new ideas at the bot-  
tom of the map. They also sketched  
the best ones as wireframes. Each  
group engaged with all three  
diagrams and got to build on their  
colleagues’ thoughts.  
Figure 9-10 shows part of one whiteboard used for this exer-  
cise. Note that the color-coding of the sticky notes varied from  
what Adlin and Carr set out—we used yellow notes for steps,  
blue for comments, pink for questions, and green for ideas—  
but the process for creating the design map was the same.  
FIGURE 9-10. A section of a design map created in a workshop shows the various types of information  
on different-colored sticky notes.  
250 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution User Story Mapping  
My childhood neighbor had a Mr. Potato Head toy. If you’re  
not familiar with this toy, it’s a featureless plastic head to  
which you add various facial features. The resulting combina-  
tions can be humorous—e.g., Groucho Marx glasses with big  
red lips.  
Producers of software typically want to avoid creating prod-  
ucts that look like Mr. Potato Head. But without a common  
vision of what you are building, it’s possible to unknowingly  
combine elements that don’t go well together.  
Agile development—the leading approach for software  
development—strives to break the product down into small  
chunks, called user stories. These are short descriptions of a  
feature told from the user’s perspective. User stories typically  
have a common format\:  
As a \<type of user\>, I want \<some goal\> so that  
\<some reason\>.  
While utilizing user stories makes development more manage-  
able, it can also cause teams to lose the big picture of what  
they are building. Focusing on individual features gives a team  
tunnel vision, making it hard for them to keep the overall end  
goal in mind.  
To avoid the Mr. Potato Head effect in software development,  
Agile coach Jeff Patton came up with a technique called user  
story mapping. He advises development teams to not assume  
everyone has the same view of the final product. In his book  
User Story Mapping, Patton describes this phenomenon and  
how to overcome it\:  
If I have an idea in my head and I describe it in writing,  
when you read that document, you might quite pos-  
sibly imagine something different. … However, if we  
get together and talk, you can tell me what you think  
and I can ask questions. The talking goes better if we  
can externalize our thinking by drawing pictures or or-  
ganizing our ideas using index cards or sticky notes. If  
we give each other time to explain our thoughts with  
words and pictures, we build shared understanding.  
A strength of user story maps is that they are simple to  
comprehend. Figure 9-11 shows an example created by Steve  
Rogalsky, an expert Agile coach with the company Protegra.  
You can see the alignment of user activities \(in orange and  
blue sticky notes\) to planned features \(in yellow\).  
User story mapping has its roots in task modeling, as pio-  
neered by Larry and Lucy Constantine.  
\* The technique is flexi-  
ble, with different ways to approach creating a map. The main  
elements that most user story maps include are as follows\:  
•  
User types. A brief description of the different roles the  
system is designed for. These are typically listed at the top

Backbone. A sequence of user activities, listed across the  
top of the diagram. Frequently, a more granular descrip-  
tion of user tasks that form a flow across the phases  
accompanies them; these are listed horizontally just below  
the phases of the backbone.  
•  
User stories. The body of the map contains stories needed  
to achieve the desired outcomes. These are typically prior-  
itized and separated into releases.  
The backbone is similar to the chronology in an experience  
map. A user story map, however, tends to lack much of the  
detail and context of an experience map, such as thoughts and  
feelings. Instead, it focuses on software product development.  
The process of user story mapping requires team participation  
from the very beginning. Follow these steps to involve every-  
one in the map’s creation\:  
Frame the idea  
As a team, discuss why you are building the product.  
Identify and record the benefits and problems it solves.  
Also decide on who you are building the product for.  
Write your responses down at the top of the map.  
Map the big picture  
Illustrate the flow of the solution chronologically, includ-  
ing details about specific actions. If possible, include the  
pains and joys users have today to inform your develop-  
ment decisions.  
Explore  
Use the map to facilitate conversations about desired out-  
comes and the intended experience. Describe the features  
to support users and record them as stories on the map.  
Sketch solutions as needed, and go back and interview  
customers as well.  
Create a release strategy  
Break the user stories into different releases, start-  
ing with the minimum that’s necessary to reach the  
desired outcome.  
Build, measure, learn  
As development progresses, track the team’s learning  
against the user story map. Keep it in a visible place and  
refer back to it often.  
A user story map illustrates how user stories relate to one an-  
other in an overarching model. This allows teams to grasp the  
entirety of the system. More importantly, they align planning  
and development with actual user experiences. Ultimately, it’s  
about developing a shared understanding of software a team  
intends to build to guide decisions, improve efficiency, and  
result in better outcomes.  
Typically, the exercise is done offline, using sticky notes and a  
whiteboard. Figure 9-12 shows an example created in a team  
workshop.  
It’s also possible to map stories visually online using software  
such as MURAL. I once facilitated a user story mapping for a  
Design the New Experience with Maps 253FIGURE 9-12. This example of a user story map created by a team in a face-to-face workshop reveals the prioritization of efforts into releases.

large publisher with people spread out geographically from  
Chicago, Illinois, to Dublin, Ireland. We used conferencing  
software to establish an audio and video connection for the  
conversation and then used the MURAL virtual whiteboard to  
map the user stories \(Figure 9-13\).  
The bottom line is this\: don’t assume that everyone has the  
same mental image of what a project or effort is about.  
To highlight the importance of making the process visu-  
al, Jeff Patton uses to the image in Figure 9-14 in his book  
and ­ elsewhere.  
Visualizations—whether maps of the current state or some  
to-be scenario—go a long way toward establishing a shared  
reality and getting teams aligned and on the same page.  
FIGURE 9-14. Don’t assume everyone has the same picture of the  
solution in their minds.  
Design the New Experience with Maps 255Design Sprints  
Design sprints are a popular format for bringing teams through  
a structured series of activities to design a specific solution.  
Once you have a direction to follow from the alignment work-  
shop, outlined in the previous chapter, run a design sprint to  
maximize agreement on a solution in a short amount of time.  
The use of the word sprint borrows from Agile methods,  
which organize development work into short one- to four-  
week units of time. Design sprints then focus on solving  
conceptual challenges before development begins.  
There are a lot of similarities between multi-day alignment  
workshops and design sprints. For instance, a map of the user  
journey is a core part of design sprints, as outlined in Jake  
Knapp’s bestselling book Sprint. Figure 9-15 shows the basic  
flow of a design sprint.  
FIGURE 9-15. Design sprints typically begin with a map of the experience  
to understand the context of the solutions a team will devise within the  
next week.  
256 Chapter 9\: Envisioning Future Experiences\: Build the Right Solution  
The authors of Design Sprints, Richard Banfield, Todd Lom-  
bardo, and Trace Wax, also highlight the function of maps in  
the sprint process. They write\: “\[Mapping\] will add context to  
your project and highlight opportunities you may have other-  
wise missed.”  
But where the focus of an alignment workshop is to get  
agreement on the right problem to solve, a design sprint aims  
to produce a concrete solution. Sprints may use a map of the  
experience as a starting point to set the context, but quickly  
move into specific design activities. Alignment workshops and  
design sprints complement each other, representing different  
modes of thinking.  
# Summary  
Most of the techniques described throughout this book have  
focused primarily on current state mapping, or visualizing  
an experience as it can currently be observed. Future state  
mapping seeks to diagram an intended experience as it is to  
be created.  
First, plan experiments to validate assumptions about a future  
state experience. These can be lightweight tests to gain feed-  
back from simulated scenarios, relying on Lean techniques.  
Then, map out the desired future experience. In many cases,  
a separate diagram may not be needed\: the future state can  
be appended to an existing map. If necessary, however, an  
additional map can be created to allow a team to reflect on the target experience. Techniques for illustrating an intended  
experience include storylines, design maps, and user story  
mapping. A design sprint is a concentrated format to solve  
specific design challenges and emerge with solutions to move  
forward into implementation.  
Overall, visualizing the experience—whether the as-is state  
or the to-be state—helps align teams by forming a common  
understanding and instilling collective empathy.

# Rapid Online Mapping and Design Workshop  
by Jim Kalbach  
MURAL \(mural.co\) is a leading virtual whiteboard for design  
collaboration. It’s a cloud-based service that lets you work visu-  
ally online, from wherever you are. I joined the MURAL team in  
March 2015.  
We used our product to examine the onboarding experience at  
MURAL and make improvements. To do this, we held a one-  
and-a-half-day workshop in Buenos Aires with a group of eight  
people with different roles. The workshop had three parts.  
# Part 1\: Empathize  
The aim was to first understand the user’s experience. To do  
this, I mapped out elements of the experience using MURAL in  
advance of the session \(Figure 9-16\). There were three main  
sections to the mural I created\:  
•  
Value chain. To understand the flow of value, I mapped  
the customer value chain \(upper left\). This provides an  
overview of the actors involved and their relationships  
to one another.  
•  
Proto-personas. In the upper right of Figure 9-16 you’ll  
see three proto-personas. These were based on the  
actors in the value chain diagram. Sofia, the design  
lead, was our primary persona for this exercise.  
•  
Experience map. In the middle was an experience map,  
based on prior research I’d conducted on team collabo-  
ration as well as recent customer interviews. The circu-  
lar shapes represent repeat behavior.  
A space was left below these for the results of the second part  
of the workshop.  
As a group, we discussed each of these elements to understand  
the broader experience. The digital format of the diagram  
allowed us to add and update it on the fly. For instance, we  
added details to the proto-personas as we discussed them.  
# Part 2\: Envision  
We then brainstormed about barriers to consumption. We  
asked, “What is keeping the primary persona from using our  
service repeatedly?”  
With a large virtual area to work on, it was easy to record  
answers right below the experience map. These were clustered  
and prioritized using the dot voting feature built into MURAL.  
We then conducted an exercise to find solutions, called a design stu-  
dio. For each barrier we identified, participants individually sketched  
possible solutions. The sketches were photographed and uploaded  
to another mural for everyone in the workshop to see \(Figure 9-17\).

# Part 3\: Evaluate  
After lunch, the team broke into two groups. Each focused on  
consolidating the sketches into a single solution. Our aim was to  
create testable artifacts by the end of the day.  
Using Usertesting.com, an online unmoderated remote testing ser-  
vice, we quickly got feedback on our proposed solutions. The tests  
ran overnight, and by the next morning we had initial results.  
Some of our assumptions were validated, while others were dis-  
proven. We took the test feedback and iterated on the proposed  
designs. In a final step, we created a concrete plan for implementa-  
tion over the next few months.  
# Conclusion  
This rapid approach allowed us to go from understanding the expe-  
rience to prototyping to testing in less than two days. There were  
no written proposals, reports, or other documents.  
Experience mapping does not have to be a lengthy process. Using  
an online tool like MURAL makes the process even quicker. More  
than that, working online enables different elements to be combined  
in one place for a better overview. It also makes it easy to loop in  
others later who were not present at the workshop. Creating the ex-  
perience map online makes the process an ongoing one rather than a  
static, one-time event, regardless of where people are.

a team to come to a final solution together \(in this

# Primary Diagram Types in Detail  
Part 3 discusses the most commonly used diagram types  
in detail. Related techniques are introduced and discussed  
alongside each of these archetypes to provide a broad context  
to mapping.  
•  
•  
•  
Service blueprints are one of the oldest formal techniques  
and set the tone for other diagrams. Chapter 10 looks at  
service blueprints and ways they’ve been extended.  
Customer journey maps are perhaps the most popular  
type of diagram. Chapter 11 details the current practice of  
customer journey mapping and related techniques.  
Experience maps resemble service blueprints and cus-  
tomer journey maps closely, but with some important  
differences, discussed in Chapter 12.  
•  
Mental model diagramming is a unique technique created  
by Indi Young. I encourage you to read her book, Mental  
Models, but Chapter 13 summarizes key aspects of this  
method and related approaches.  
•  
Chapter 14 focuses on ecosystem models, or diagrams  
that provide a big-picture view of an overall system and  
how its parts relate to each other and permit or inhibit  
the flow of value between entities.  
Mapping experiences isn’t a single method; it’s a way of  
telling the story of value alignment. There are many ways that  
can be done. This book is thus about possibilities, not a spe-  
cific technique. Understanding these basic tools and their vari-  
ants is core to knowing which map to use in which situation. IN THIS CHAPTER

■ Case study\: Facilitating collaborative sessions with practical service  
blueprinting In my first book, Designing Web Navigation, I discuss the  
principle of transitional volatility. First described by David  
Danielson in 2003, transitional volatility is the degree of re-  
orientation a person experiences when moving from page to  
page on a website. If there is too much volatility, they get lost  
in hyperspace.  
Figure 10-1 shows this pattern of interaction. It’s a sequence  
of becoming accustomed to one location \(habituate\), forming  
an expectation about the next point \(predict\), and then ad-  
justing to a new position \(reorient\). The pattern then repeats.  
Predict  
Habituate  
Reorient  
FIGURE 10-1. The pattern of transitional volatility across points of  
interaction.  
CHAPTER 10  
# Service Blueprints  
We see a similar effect on a larger scale when individuals  
interact with an organization. Instead of page to page, they  
move from touchpoint to touchpoint. At each interaction  
there is a reorientation period, even if brief. If there is too  
much reorientation at each touchpoint, the experience  
feels disjointed.  
A high degree of transitional volatility arises from an inconsis-  
tency in touchpoints. You’ve probably experienced this your-  
self. For instance, I once had an unpleasant incident with my  
credit card. The card issuer and the bank backing it seemed  
to disagree about who was responsible for my problem. Each  
blamed the other, and I got caught in the middle going back  
and forth.  
My experience spanned months and used various means of  
communication. For some things I used their website; for  
others I had to call. There were emails, regular mail, and even  
a fax. The degree of reorientation at each point was high.  
Apparently, it was my job to figure it all out. Needless to say,  
they no longer have my business.  
265Or, more recently I had a bad experience with a recorded  
music publishing platform. Their online business is separate  
from their pressed CD business, even though there are shared  
resources, such as file uploads. Trying to sort out issues across  
the two meant repeating myself a lot and restarting conver-  
sations with each. The burden was on me, costing hours of  
my time.  
The advice is clear\: don’t force people to bridge gaps of your  
offering. That’s your job. Mapping experiences allows you to  
locate transitional volatility within a broader system of interac-  
tions and find innovative solutions to address it.  
This is not to say, however, that you must design every touch-  
point. In many situations, aspects will be beyond your control.  
However, understanding multiple factors that make up an  
experience allows you to determine which parts to focus on  
as well as how to avoid negative experiences, even if beyond  
your control.  
What’s more, the aim isn’t for uniformity across the board.  
Rather, strive for coherency in the conception and design  
of the overall system. Create a balanced perception of your  
organization, but still give people control to shape their  
own experiences.  
Although we live in a service-based economy, good service  
design remains elusive. Part of the challenge is that, unlike  
physical goods, the transitions between touchpoints in a  
service are intangible. They unfold in real time, and then those  
moments are gone.  
266 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints  
Service design is a growing field that seeks to prevent unin-  
tentional service experiences. The objective of service design is  
to take deliberate actions that create, deliver, and sustain posi-  
tive service experiences over time, consistently and repeatedly.  
Mapping out the experience in a service blueprint is a primary  
activity in the field.  
This chapter provides an overview and historical background  
to service blueprints. It also touches on related and extended  
techniques, such as Lean consumption and expressive ser-  
vice blueprinting.  
# Visualizing Services  
Service design is not new. It can be traced back to the writ-  
ings of G. Lynn Shostack in the early ‘80s. A cornerstone of  
service design is a map of the service process. Shostack refers  
to these as service blueprints in her original articles. Figure  
10-2 shows an early example from Shostack’s 1984 article  
“Designing Services That Deliver.”  
This blueprint is rather plain and resembles a flow diagram.  
Yet it yields valuable insight into the experience of dealing  
with a discount broker. For instance, there are about a dozen  
steps that are required just to “prepare and mail statements.”  
Shostack also includes an indication of potential fail points  
\(noted with an “F” in a black circle\). These are critical points  
where the service may show issues of inconsistency or break  
down completely. Shostack stresses the overall importance of map-  
ping activities in service design. She writes\:  
The root of most service problems is, in  
fact, lack of systematic design and control.  
The use of a blueprint can help a service  
developer not only to identify problems  
ahead of time but also to see the potential  
for new market opportunities.  
FIGURE 10-2. An early example of a service blueprint by G. Lynn Shostack shows the  
complexity of providing a service.  
...  
A blueprint encourages creativity, preemp-  
tive problem solving, and controlled imple-  
mentation. It can reduce the potential for  
failure and enhance management’s ability  
to think effectively about new services.  
The blueprint principle helps cut down the  
time and inefficiency of random service  
development and gives a higher level view  
of service management prerogatives.  
Since then, service blueprints have become widely  
used. For instance, the British Standard Institution  
provides general guidelines for service design  
in BS 7000-3\: 1994. This gives direction on the  
management of the design of service across  
industries from the customers’ perspective. The in-  
tent of blueprinting is to isolate fail points—steps  
where the service may go awry—and address  
these ­ accordingly.

FIGURE 10-3. This service blueprint of a hotel service created by Bitner et al. represents a standard way of creating the diagrams.  
268 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints FIGURE 10-4. An example of a service blueprint for a conference attendee visually aligns frontstage and backstage activities.  
Visualizing Services 269Mary Jo Bitner and colleagues developed a more structured  
and normalized approach to service blueprinting. Figure 10-3  
shows an example of a blueprint for a hotel, created by Bitner  
and her team.  
The separate rows of information and color-coding make this  
map easier to read than Shostack’s example. It borrows from  
swim lane diagrams found in business process modeling. In  
doing so, this arrangement also makes both the service expe-  
rience and the service provision more comprehensible, better  
revealing the opportunities for improvement.  
Specifically, this arrangement highlights the separation of  
frontstage interactions, which are what the individual expe-  
riences, and backstage interactions, the processes necessary  
to provide a service. The notion of frontstage and backstage  
is found throughout service design literature, and it reflects  
the basic principles of value alignment presented in this book.  
The metaphor recalls a theater, where the audience sees only  
what’s on the stage. Everything backstage is invisible to them  
and goes into supporting the frontstage experience.  
Modern versions of service blueprints follow the pattern set  
out by Bitner and colleagues. Figure 10-4 shows a service  
blueprint created by Brandon Schauer, previously a strategist  
with Adaptive Path, a leading user experience design group,  
and now Senior VP at Rare, a climate change advocacy group.  
It depicts the experience of a conference attendee.  
270 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints  
# Extending Service Blueprinting  
Service blueprinting techniques continue to evolve. For  
instance, Thomas Wreiner and colleagues modified Bitner et  
al.’s standard format by adding multiple providers, as outlined  
in their 2009 article “Exploring Service Blueprints for Multiple  
Actors.” Figure 10-5 shows interactions between three actors  
in a public parking lot\: the motorist, the operator, and the  
owner of the lot.  
Their approach shows that although on the surface a park-  
ing service may look trivial, underneath is a more complex  
structure, as visualized in their diagram. As services become  
more and more complex, with a blend of offline and online  
touchpoints, diagram techniques that reveal intricate behind-  
the-scenes relationships \(like that in Figure 10-5\) will become  
more and more relevant.  
Erik Flowers and Megan Miller, founders of the Practical  
Service Design community, have also modified the standard  
service blueprinting technique. Their approach seeks to coor-  
dinate frontstage and backstage actions, but with a broader  
range of aspects to consider.  
Additionally, their model gets away from a strict swim-lane  
approach in favor of color-coded stacks. This saves space and  
makes for easier viewing online, in particular. The stacks are  
arranged in columns and can be of varying heights.  
The definition of the step or stage in the service interaction  
goes at the top of the stack, followed by the touchpoint  
description. This can be a screenshot or photo, if available. Blueprint 3

FIGURE 10-5. An extended approach to service blueprinting maps multiple stakeholders in one diagram.  
Extending Service Blueprinting 271Below that come descriptions of the actors and systems  
involved. In most cases, there is some piece of information to  
indicate for these top four layers.  
The next elements are optional and may vary in number; they  
include details on relevant policies and rules, observations  
and facts, metrics and data, and critical moments. To engage  
others, you can also record open questions from the team  
and even start generating ideas to solve the identified oppor-  
tunities. Figure 10-6 shows the basic practical service blue-  
print template.  
The approach is flexible and free of dogmatic “thou-shalt-  
nots.” It can be adapted and extended to different situations.  
You can see a completed example and learn more about this  
approach—including how to facilitate practical blueprinting  
sessions—in the case study at the end of the chapter.  
# Service Blueprint Template  
FIGURE 10-6. An alternative approach to service  
blueprinting—the practical service blueprint—  
presents different aspects of a service encounter in  
color-coded stacks rather than using swim lanes.  
272 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints Expressive Service Blueprinting  
A common criticism of service blueprints is that they don’t  
explicitly include information about the individual’s emotional  
state. To address this gap, Susan Spraragen and Carrie Chan  
added the dimension of feelings to service blueprints, in an  
approach they call “expressive service blueprinting.”  
Figure 10-7 shows an example \(also seen in Chapter 1, Figure  
1-4\) of a patient’s visit to the ophthalmologist. The key com-  
ponents of an expressive service blueprint that are distinct  
from a traditional service blueprint are as follows\:  
•  
Emotive responses. Consumer emotions are clearly stated  
and graphically shown either through icons, photographs,  
graphs, or other elements.  
•  
Layout. More space is allocated to the onstage customer  
journey than the backstage activities, as this stage of the  
blueprinting and design process emphasizes the consum-  
er’s perspective.  
•  
Provider identity . The roles of the service participants are  
stated in terms of their function relative to the service  
domain. So, rather than using generic terms like provider  
and consumer , use terms that will resonate with actual  
team members in the provider organization.  
A fundamental challenge illustrated here is one of prescrip-  
tion compliance. In this example, the patient is left confused  
about their prescription and concerned about the cost of the  
medicine. The expressive blueprint illustrates the source of  
the confusion by tracking two emotive states\: distraction and  
anxiety, aspects which might have been overlooked using  
traditional blueprinting techniques.  
# Related Approaches  
“Lean” is a broad term that gets used in a variety of ways. All  
of the uses, however, have one thing in common\: the notion of  
reducing waste. James Womack and Daniel Jones, pioneers in the  
Lean movement, outline the fundamental principles in their land-  
mark book Lean Thinking. The steps they recommend taking are\:  
1\. Specify the value. State what value you are creating from  
the customer’s perspective. Define this in terms of the  
whole experience, not just individual interactions.  
2\. Identify the value chain. The value chain is all of the  
actions and processes needed for an organization to  
deliver that value. In Lean, the goal is to eliminate steps  
that do not add value.  
3\. Optimize flow. Lean is about increasing the efficiency of  
production. This means optimizing the backstage service  
processes.  
4\. Create customer pull. After flow is established, let the  
customer pull value upstream. Start with the customer  
demand or need, and align your offering to that.  
Diagrams are an inherent part of Lean practices. Value stream  
mapping is a specific technique for illustrating the value  
chain—see point \#2. These graphs focus solely on the back-  
stage processes needed to deliver value to the customer, as  
seen in Figure 10-8.  
Related Approaches 273 Expressive service blueprint for opthalmologist visit  
FIGURE 10-7. An expressive service blueprint integrates emotive response into the diagram for a more experiential view of the interaction.  
274 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints This diagram resembles the bottom half of a typical service  
blueprint. And while it doesn’t appear particularly custom-  
er-centric in nature, the intent of a value stream map is to  
understand how value is delivered. Authors Karen Martin and  
Mike Osterling explain the benefit of this tool in their book  
Value Stream Mapping\:  
In most organizations, no one person can describe  
the complete series of events required to transform a  
customer request into a good or service. … This gap  
in understanding is the kind of problem that leads to  
making improvements in one functional area only to  
create new problems in another area. … It’s the kind  
of problem that propels well-meaning companies to  
implement experience technology “solutions” that  
do little to address the true problem or improve the  
customer experience.  
FIGURE 10-8. This example of a value stream map reveals a focus on time and efficiency.  
Related Approaches 275Being Lean is being aligned. Alignment diagrams, then, not  
only fit into the Lean canon, but they potentially extend it by  
including a rich description of customer experience.  
# Lean Consumption  
One goal of value-centered design is reducing complexity on  
behalf of the customer. To illustrate this, G. Lynn Shostack ex-  
amined the specific timings of each interaction in her original  
mapping studies in the 1980s.  
Figure 10-9 shows precise timings for a service encounter  
Shostack offers as an example—in this case, getting a corner  
shoeshine. Since service encounters happen in real time,  
service designers should establish a standard and acceptable  
timeline, indicated directly on the blueprint.  
James Womack and Daniel Jones coined the term “lean  
consumption” in their 2005 article of the same name. In it,  
they describe the potential for positive business returns and  
increased value creation for both sides of the equation\:  
FIGURE 10-9. This simple blueprint for a shoeshine includes timings down to the second.  
276 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints Companies may think that they save time and money  
by off-loading work to customers, making it the cus-  
tomer’s problem to get the computer up and running,  
and wasting the customer’s time. In fact, however,  
the opposite is true. By streamlining the systems for  
providing goods and services, and making it easier for  
customers to buy and use them, a growing number  
of companies are actually lowering costs while saving  
everyone’s time. In the process, these businesses are  
learning more about their customers, strengthening  
consumer loyalty, and attracting new customers who  
defect from less user-friendly competitors.  
FIGURE 10-10. BEFORE—inspecting and registering a vehicle takes the customer 210 minutes across two service providers.  
Related Approaches 277To visualize lean consumption, the authors recommend creating  
a map of the steps customers go through to consume products  
and services. They call these diagrams lean consumption maps.  
Figures 10-10 and 10-11 show lean consumption maps cre-  
ated by Pete Abilla, a service design and business consultant.  
Compare the before \(Figure 10-10\) and after \(Figure 10-11\)  
states of a service encounter for a yearly car inspection and  
registration in the US.  
The bar chart shows that the process takes the customer a  
total of 210 minutes, with touchpoints across two providers\:  
the auto mechanic and the Division of Motor Vehicles \(DMV\).  
After combining inspection and registration at Jiffy Lube, a  
national chain of service stations in the US, the process is  
reduced to just 65 minutes.  
From the lean consumption perspective, the imperative for  
service providers is clear\: don’t waste the customer’s time.  
Making their experience as lean as possible improves satisfac-  
tion and loyalty. This ultimately gets reflected in the bottom  
line of the business.  
FIGURE 10-11. AFTER—a redesign of the service reduces the time investment for the customer to just 65 minutes.  
278 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints Elements of a Service Blueprint  
Service blueprints consist of several layers of information. It’s  
the interaction between these layers that provides a systems  
view of the service experience. A service blueprint has five key  
components, shown arranged in Figure 10-12\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Physical evidence. These are the manifestations of the  
touchpoints that customers interact with. They can  
include physical devices, electronic software, and face-to-  
face interactions.  
Customer actions. These are the main steps a customer  
takes to interact with an organization’s service.  
Onstage touchpoints. These are the actions of the pro-  
vider that are visible to the customer. The line of visibility  
separates onstage touchpoints from backstage actions.  
Backstage actions. These are the internal service provi-  
sion mechanisms of the organization that are not visible  
to the customer, but that directly impact the customer  
experience.  
Support processes. These are internal processes that indi-  
rectly impact the customer experience. Support processes  
can include interactions between the organization and  
partners or third-party suppliers.  
Table 10-1 summarizes the main aspects that define service  
blueprints using the framework outlined in Chapter 2.  
TABLE 10-1. Defining aspects of service blueprints.  
Point of  
view  
Individual as the recipient of a service.  
Typically centered on a single actor, but may  
also include multiple actors when examining  
an entire service ecology.  
Structure Chronological.  
Scope Examples typically illustrate a discrete service  
encounter, but also include overviews of a  
whole service ecosystem.  
Focus Focus on service provision processes in a ser-  
vice encounter with emphasis on backstage  
actions and touchpoints. Extensions of service  
blueprinting add emotive information.  
Uses Used for diagnosis, improvement, and man-  
agement of existing service systems.  
Good for analyzing specific timings of service  
interactions, down to the minute in some cases.  
Strengths Simple, predefined structure with a clear focus  
of attention.  
Relatively light research and investigation  
needed.  
Suitable for cocreation with teams and  
stakeholders.  
Easy for others to understand from a single page.  
Weaknesses Lack many of the contextual, environmental  
cues of an experience \(e.g., “noisy setting” or  
“great-tasting food”\).  
The metaphor of a blueprint is a misnomer\:  
they are more like flow diagrams than archi-  
tectural blueprints.

# Facilitating Collaborative Sessions with  
# ­ Practical Service Blueprinting  
by Erik Flowers and Megan Miller  
Service blueprints provide an all-at-once view of how a company  
actually works, resulting in actionable insights that build consen-  
sus and empathy. We found traditional blueprints tended to focus  
on individual interactions, often missing the big picture. That’s  
why we set out to evolve the blueprinting format into a more  
practical application that provides a better overview.  
We see it like the difference between trying to build a house  
using an artist’s watercolor rendering \(traditional blueprints\)  
and an architect’s actual blueprint \(practical service blueprints\).  
They both tell a story, but only one really lets you take action.  
Our blueprinting format borrows its DNA from many other  
sources, including aspects of the classic service blueprint, cus-  
tomer journey maps, and empathy maps, as well as elements  
from storytelling. The approach evolved while we were solving  
real-world problems with customers, so its applicability was  
validated as we iterated on the approach. The practical service  
blueprint is rooted in the ethos of taking elements of what is  
around us and combining them into something greater, leverag-  
ing input from thousands of people around the world.  
We’ve helped banks, health care providers, technology compa-  
nies, video-streaming companies, and even governments learn  
to use the format, as well as develop workspace facilitation  
techniques. The key, we’ve found, is to ensure that insights are  
actionable in the moment—during the session, as a part of the  
facilitation itself. Don’t walk away from a practical blueprinting  
session without action items for tangible change. It’s not a  
workshop, it’s work.  
Overall, there are six steps to practical service blueprinting that  
will guide you through the process\:  
•  
Explore the opportunity space. First, define the oppor-  
tunity you want to work on. This can be a known issue  
or stem from a desire to fill a gap that may span chan-  
nels, team, and contexts.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Choose the scenarios. Choose a collection of important  
or particularly painful scenarios to blueprint.  
Blueprint the scenarios. Using our blueprinting  
technique, map the end-to-end view of the service  
experience.  
Collect critical moments and ideas. Potential service  
improvements come from the interpretation of the  
insights that your team has together.  
Identify themes. Cluster the critical moments into  
themes that apply across scenarios for a view into lon-  
ger-term holistic improvements.  
282 Chapter 10\: Service Blueprints •  
Take action. Create a service improvement roadmap that  
includes tactical fixes you can implement immediately along  
with strategic innovations that may unfold over time.  
Figure 10-13 shows an example of a completed practical service  
blueprint created by a cross-functional team at Intuit using the  
preceding process. You can see a critical moment indicated in the  
middle of the diagram, as well as several arrows and circles high-  
lighting key points in the service experience to address.  
When people get together to build a practical service blueprint,  
there are two constants. The first is that there is some cohort of  
people who are initially resistant to the activity and grumble about  
how they’ve done things like this before. The second is that when  
those same people thank the facilitators, they gush about how  
different this process is, how much insight it uncovered that was  
previously untapped, and how wrong they were.  
We’ve personally witnessed multibillion-dollar companies pivot to  
take action and make meaningful changes to their systems, process-  
es, and experiences on the same day of the activity. Practical service  
blueprinting is the opposite of theory or a laboratory experiment; it’s  
a practical, proven tactic designed to advance and take ground.  
The uptake of practical service blueprinting by practitioners has  
been enormous. People from major companies, universities, and  
governments on every continent have used our approach. At the  
same time, startups and small companies use the format as a way  
to hone in on what could make their offering better. The broad use  
and appeal is a testament to the technique’s underlying value.  
Toby Wilcock, CEO at Cloudwerx, a cloud services company in Austra-  
lia, said of Practical Service Design\: “Your courses have been great for  
Cloudwerx. We’ve massively leveraged blueprinting in the Salesforce  
ecosystem. It’s the backbone of our business. Erik and Megan smash it!”  
Practical service blueprinting is an open source technique. We’re not  
an agency and we don’t do this commercially. Instead, we shepherd  
collective wisdom back into the format. We believe this is what has  
made it so successful. In the end, the real kudos go to the people  
who took the process and format of the blueprint and applied it in  
real-world situations. The outcomes speak for themselves.

■ Case study\: Value story mapping—an alternative view to CJMs The exact origin of the term customer journey map \(CJM\) is  
unclear. The basic idea of looking across touchpoints seems  
to have its roots in Jan Carlzon’s concept of moments of  
truth.\* Carlzon advocated an ecological view of the customer  
experience, but he never explicitly talked about a map of the  
customer journey as such.  
It wasn’t until the field of customer experience management  
came into focus just before the turn of the century that  
journey mapping emerged. For instance, in a seminal article  
appearing in Marketing Management in 1994, authors Lewis  
Carbone and Stephan Haeckel speak of an experience blue-  
print, which they define as “a pictorial representation of the  
experience clues to be engineered, along with specification  
that describes them and their individual functions.”†  
\*  
See Jan Carlzon, Moments of Truth \(Reed Business, 1987\).

riences,” Marketing Management \(Winter 1994\).  
CHAPTER 11  
# Customer Journey Maps  
In 2002, customer experience pioneer Colin Shaw introduced  
the concept of what he calls moment mapping, recalling  
Carlzon.‡ The resulting diagram \(Figure 11-1\) uses an arrow to  
map the phases of the customer experience.  
From this, analysis opportunities for creating a positive cus-  
tomer experience can be derived, shown in Figure 11-2.  
The contemporary style of CJMs seems to have come about  
in the mid-2000s. Bruce Temkin, a central figure in customer  
experience, is one of the early advocates for CJMs and greatly  
promoted their use in the US. In a 2010 Forrester report titled  
“Mapping the Customer Journey,” Temkin defines CJMs  
as “documents that visually illustrate customers’ processes,  
needs, and perceptions throughout their relationships with  
a company.”  
‡ Colin Shaw and John Ivens, Building Great Customer Experiences \(Palgrave  
Macmillan, 2002\).  
287Temkin also highlights the significance of CJMs in his blog  
post “It’s All About Your Customer’s Journey”\:  
Companies need to use tools and processes that rein-  
force an understanding of actual customer needs. One  
of the key tools in this area is something called a cus-  
tomer journey map. … Used appropriately, these maps  
can shift a company’s perspective from inside-out to  
outside-in.  
Figure 11-3 shows an example of a customer journey map,  
in this case for a broadband provider. This CJM was created  
by Effective UI, a leading digital experience consultancy. It  
includes a very prominent emotional curve in the center. This  
suggests that many factors come into play, chief among these  
the emotional experience.  
FIGURE 11-1. Colin Shaw’s 2002 description of the elements of a moment map resembles a contemporary CJM.  
288 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps CJMs are organization-centric, viewing individuals as consum-  
ers of the organization’s products and services. They tell the  
story of how a company goes to market. As a result, three key  
elements define CJMs as such.  
First is an initial phase where the individual becomes aware of  
the service or brand. Phase labels such as “Become Aware,”  
“Discover,” or “Inquiry” \(as seen in Figure 11-3\) are common  
to mark the beginning point in the journey.

290 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps FIGURE 11-4. The customer journey canvas created by Marc Stickdorn and Jakob Schneider is a variation of the typical CJM.  
291Next there is a decision point, typically around a purchase. It’s  
common to have a phase labeled “Buy,” “Select,” or “Ac-  
quire” in the middle of the journey. In the previous example  
\(Figure 11-3\), there is a clear phase marked “Purchase.”  
Finally, CJMs need to show why a customer would stay loyal  
and continue to use the service. This is often indicated simply  
with a phase called “Use” or similar, but there may be addi-  
tional interactions such as “Get Support,” “Renew,” or even  
“Advocate,” all of which reflect how individuals get value  
from the solution.  
CJMs help answer such questions as\: How can an organiza-  
tion better engage customers? How can it provide value that  
keeps them coming back? How can it make services more  
relevant?  
The answers to these questions show that creating great ex-  
periences is not about individual touchpoint optimization but  
rather how touchpoints come together into a unified whole.  
CJMs are a strategic tool to visualize touchpoints to manage  
them more effectively.  
The customer journey canvas \(Figure 11-4\) is a variation of  
a CJM that is particularly good for getting input from the  
entire team. The open canvas arrangement invites others  
to contribute. The customer journey canvas was created by  
service design experts Marc Stickdorn and Jakob Schneider  
for their influential book This is Service Design Thinking. The  
canvas-style template allows teams to audit their customer’s  
journey together.  
The basic format of the customer journey canvas reveals  
both frontstage and backstage components to the service  
experience. It aligns such things as pre-service actions of the  
provider to customer expectations, as well as how the pro-  
vider will manage customer relationships over time after a  
service encounter.  
But CJMs don’t have as many hard-and-fast rules of format-  
ting and formulation as a traditional service blueprint \(as  
outlined in the previous chapter\). The approach is versatile. It’s  
easy to find examples that represent exceptions.  
# Customer Lifecycle Maps  
Some practitioners also make a distinction between CJMs  
and customer lifecycle maps.  
\* The latter are broader still and  
deal with the lifetime relationship between a customer and  
an organization. Customer lifecycles typically include slightly  
more abstract phases that reflect an overall relationship rather  
than a specific journey.  
The history of customer lifecycle planning can be traced back  
to the early 1960s. For instance, in 1961 Russell Colley de-  
veloped a framework for evaluating advertising success in a  
book titled Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Adver-  
tising Results \(the technique is referred to as DAGMAR for  
short\). Colley’s model had several phases of interaction, from  
\*  
See, for example, Lavrans Løvlie, “Customer Journeys and Customer Lifecy-  
cles,” Livework blog \(Dec 2013\).  
292 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps FIGURE 11-5. John Jenkins’s model of the customer lifecycle \(1972\) represents perhaps the earliest example of a journey map.  
Customer Lifecycle Maps 293awareness to action. His contemporaries Robert Lavidge and  
Gary Steiner offered a similar model that same year.\*  
From these models and others formed during the 1960s, John  
Jenkins developed one of the earliest comprehensive lifecycle  
diagrams in his 1972 book Marketing and Customer Be-  
haviour . Figure 11-5 shows his original model, which he calls  
the market continuum model .  
Customer experience leader and author Kerry Bodine offers  
a modern format for customer lifecycle maps. Her proposed  
structure looks at stages from recognizing an initial need to  
selection to use to advocating or leaving. Figure 11-6 illus-  
trates these phases with arrows to show an approximate  
overall experiential motion. At first there is a divergent motion  
of seeking that resolves in a  
convergent selection, reflected  
in the arrows on the diamond  
on the left. Use of a solution  
\(as well as fixes\) is ongoing and  
circular, reflected in the circle  
on the right.  
I see the distinction between customer lifecycle maps and  
CJMs as one of hierarchy. If we include service blueprints in  
the comparison, there is a laddering effect between the three.  
Lifecycle maps look at the overall relationship of an individual  
to a brand over time. CJMs look at acquiring a specific solu-  
tion in more detail. Service blueprints detail specific interac-  
tions within the customer journey, most often after a service  
is acquired.  
Figure 11-7 illustrates the approximate relationship between  
customer lifecycles, CJMs, and service blueprints, in this case  
for the experience of buying and owning a car. Other inter-  
pretations of these diagram types exist in practice. This rep-  
resents just one way to view the relationship between them.

Knowledge Persuasion Decision Implementation Confirmation  
FIGURE 11-8. The innovation–decision process, first described by Everett Rogers, is an early model upon which CJMs are based.  
Customer Lifecycle Maps 295Related Models  
Outside of commercial settings, Everett Rogers uncovered  
the complexity of adoption of new products. In his landmark  
book Diffusion of Innovations, Rogers outlines his innovation–  
decision process, based on decades of research \(Figure 11-8\).  
Though dating back to the 1960s, this process resembles the  
typical structure of modern CJMs. The key identifying phases  
are present in both flows\: there’s a phase around awareness  
at the beginning, a decision point in the middle, and then  
phases to confirm the decision and stay loyal to adopting an  
innovation. There’s no doubt that Rogers’s process has the  
same underlying framework as a modern CJM. In fact, John  
Jenkins cites Rogers’s model as a direct influence on the early  
map shown in Figure 11-5.  
The attitude of the individual during the Persuasion phase, in  
particular, is critical. Rogers was able to narrow down pre-  
dictors of decision making in this phase to a set of five basic  
principles. These are the questions decision makers ultimately  
ask before adopting a new product or service\:  
•  
Relative advantage—Is it better than existing alternatives?  
•  
Compatibility—Is it appropriate? Does it fit into my beliefs  
and values?  
•  
Complexity—Is it easy to comprehend and use?  
•  
Trialability—Can it be tested without penalty?  
•  
Observability—Can it be observed and understood?  
296 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps  
If most are answered affirmatively, the chance of adoption is  
higher. In other words, these are the key factors that influence  
the decision-making process.  
Keep in mind that these are perceived characteristics. That is,  
the perception of value is in the mind of the customer, not  
an absolute property of a product or service. Similarly, CJMs  
seek to understand how an offering is actually perceived by  
customers, from their vantage point.  
# The Conversion Funnel  
The decision to make a purchase is typically seen as a funnel  
\(Figure 11-9\). The exact phases or steps along the way can  
vary, depending on how the funnel is conceived.  
The metaphor suggests that people enter into a wide open-  
ing and get funneled into making a purchase. But at various  
points decisions to leave the process can be made, thereby  
reducing the number of people that continue all the way  
to conversion.  
Market researchers at McKinsey and Company suggest a new  
model, which they call the consumer decision journey.  
\* Figure  
11-10 reflects their updated decision-making model.  
The circular arrangement of this model reflects a need to  
reevaluate how consumers go through the decision-making  
process. In this age of empowered consumers, the process  
\*  
See David Court et al., “The Consumer Decision Journey,” McKinsey Quar-  
terly \(Jun 2009\), and David C. Edelman, “Branding in the Digital Age\: You’re  
Spending Your Money in All the Wrong Places,” Harvard Business Review  
\(Dec 2010\). is more circular. One person’s experiences after purchase  
become the next person’s evaluation criteria. With this model,  
there is no more “top of the funnel” where consumers enter  
en masse.  
Awareness  
Consideration  
Intent  
Purchase  
Loyalty  
Advocacy  
What’s more, the authors believe consumers are increasingly  
changing the way they research and buy products and ser-  
vices. They do much more up-front research and comparison  
than ever before, particularly online.  
Traditionally, there are three main touchpoint types in com-  
merce situations\:  
•  
Stimulus—The very first time customers become aware of  
a given product or service  
•  
First moment of truth—The decision to buy a product or  
service  
•  
Second moment of truth—The first experience customers  
have using a product or service  
More and more, consumers read reviews from other consum-  
ers. They look at sites like Amazon to inform their decisions,  
or they ask Twitter followers for opinions. They look at who’s  
behind a service as well, researching profiles on LinkedIn and  
even Facebook. Regardless of industry or sector, customers  
are far more informed today than just a decade ago.  
In addition to the first and second moments of truth, market  
researchers at Google have identified a new critical touch-  
point\: the “Zero Moment of Truth,” or ZMOT for short.† It falls  
between the stimulus and the decision to buy \(Figure 11-11\).  
Content is critical at the ZMOT. But it can’t come across as  
marketing fluff\: information at the ZMOT touchpoint must be  
meaningful and valuable. Successful companies converse with  
FIGURE 11-9. A typical marketing funnel showing progression through the  
customer journey.

their markets and engage in a dialogue. They position them-  
selves not as “buy me!” banners, but as trusted advisors.  
Notice that product recommendations feeding into the ZMOT  
come after someone has already used a product. The usage  
experience is now relevant before the purchase decision.  
More importantly, people increasingly find meaning in the  
products and services they buy during the ZMOT. They want  
to know about the company and the people behind an offer-  
ing. They want to know how it fits into their value system and  
how it will define them personally.  
You may rightfully point out that people have always engaged  
in conversations with brands. Markets are conversations,  
indeed. What’s different now is a combination of the breadth  
of content available and the speed at which consumers can  
access it. Now, it’s expected that a customer researches  
various aspects of your business before even coming in direct  
contact with you or your offerings.  
In any event, the various parts of a product or service expe-  
rience are now much more interrelated than they were just a  
decade ago. A holistic mindset is needed to connect moments  
of truth and design meaningful experiences for people.  
# Elements of CJMs  
CJMs aren’t mere inventories of touchpoints. They include  
deeper insight into the motivations and attitudes of custom-  
ers. What makes them purchase? What keeps them satisfied?  
These are the types of questions a CJM needs to address.  
CJMs are decidedly less formulaic than service blueprints. They  
can include several different elements and information types.  
The creator of a CJM should include aspects appropriate to an  
organization’s needs. Some typical elements of CJMs include  
actions, goals, emotions, pain points, moments of truth, touch-  
points, brand perception, satisfaction, and opportunities.  
Figure 11-12 shows a CJM template created at Heart of the  
Customer \(heartofthecustomer.com\), a prominent CX and  
journey mapping consultancy. It includes additional elements  
related to a journey map, including a persona, customer pro-  
filing, and importance and satisfaction metrics.

journey maps using the framework outlined in Chapter 2.

302 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps Value Story Mapping—An Alternative View to CJMs  
by Michael Dennis Moore  
# CASE STUDY  
Traditional customer journey maps are naturally transaction-ori-  
ented. They show a series of events over a period of time, and  
even the customer’s thoughts and feelings are usually associat-  
ed with those discrete events.  
But, like any good story, a customer journey actually has two  
storylines. The first is the plot line of events, which I call the  
“transactional storyline.”  
The second is a character arc about a hero \(the customer, not  
you\) who faces some challenges, makes some pivotal decisions,  
and ultimately changes who they are and how they relate to  
others \(even if only in some small way\). They become a brand  
lover, a brand hater, or something in between. They actively  
recommend, actively trash, or just don’t bother to mention your  
products or services to others.  
For most companies, a positive customer transformation is  
the ultimate strategic CX/UX goal. Fortunately, that business  
goal also aligns nicely with the deepest inner goal of most  
customers\: to be the hero in a story full of wise choices, with a  
happy ending.  
When you first review a newly constructed customer journey  
map, you’re likely to find some low-hanging fruit in the form  
of obvious friction points. It can be tempting to immediately  
start brainstorming tactical improvements to smooth out the  
customer’s experience.  
But jumping directly into tactical thinking often has the unin-  
tended effect of prematurely drawing team members back into  
that familiar comfort zone of an insider’s perspective. This can  
be a slippery slope as the initial surge of customer empathy  
fades and the holistic, value-centric story becomes just a series  
of discrete transactions.  
Quick tactical fixes may be what’s needed in the short term.  
But to get the most out of your customer journey maps, you  
need a strategic framework to focus your thinking. Value story  
mapping is a way to overlay a transformational storyline on top  
of the transactional storyline by inserting key pivotal decisions  
into a journey map \(if not already there\).  
The process has three steps.

– Rational approach  
– Social influences  
– Emotional drivers  
2\. How does your archetype customer filter and prioritize these forces  
into a sensemaking story that motivates and justifies?  
304 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps  
If you ask customers directly why they made a certain decision,  
they will tend to give you an explicit sensemaking story that  
justifies their decision based on their functional goals and ratio-  
nal approach.  
However, there is almost always a deeper, implicit sensemaking  
story that motivates their decision. This often includes social influ-  
ences and emotional drives that the customer may not be willing to  
share \(or may not be aware of themselves\). Unless your customers  
are unusually candid, you will have to make an educated guess  
about the implicit story based on themes you find in your qualita-  
tive research.  
# 3\. Evaluate Your Story Roles  
Finally, it’s time to evaluate how each of the touchpoints in your  
focus phase contribute to \(or detract from\) a positive pivotal—  
decision. Be careful here. Once you start looking at the design and execu-  
tion of touchpoints, it’s easy to get sucked back into your insider  
perspective. Instead, approach your evaluation using a customer  
value–centric question\: what roles do we play in the customer’s  
sensemaking stories?  
Some of the roles are universal\: Expert, Provider, and Enabler. But  
to stand out from the competition and transform more prospects  
into loyal brand advocates you can add some phase-specific roles  
that build on each other, as seen in Figure 11-14\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Empathizer \(begin the trust-based relationship\)  
Storyteller \(envision the hero’s payoff\)  
Guide \(ensure the full value of the outcome and experience\)  
Partner \(prove you are consistently trustworthy\)  
Framing a customer journey as a value story map has many bene-  
fits, but two are especially important.

306 Chapter 11\: Customer Journey Maps First, it helps team members stay focused on the strategic goal of a  
customer transformation, even while pursuing quick tactical wins.  
Yes, marketers will still mostly focus on the early phases while de-  
signers and service managers will focus on later ones. But everyone  
can also easily see how they are contributing to the brand’s long-  
term success.  
Second, instead of simply tracking the ups and downs of custom-  
er sentiment from one transaction to the next, it frames those  
thoughts and feelings in terms of a pivotal decision outcome. In  
other words, it goes beyond the who, what, where, when, and  
how of a transactional journey and drills into the most important  
question of all\: why? After all, it’s the moments that take place in  
the mind of the customer that ultimately matter the most.

solution for companies.

■ Overview of experience maps  
■ Related models\: day-in-the-life diagrams, workflow diagrams, and  
job maps  
■ Elements of an experience map  
■ Case study\: Mapping the domestic violence journey We tend to consider a map of an experience in relation to the  
use of a product or service, as seen with service blueprints  
and customer journey maps. For sure, much of this book fo-  
cuses on mapping commercially oriented experiences. But that  
need not be the case. It’s also possible to map experiences  
independent of a given product or service.  
In particular, experience maps \(as defined in this book\) look at  
the broader context of human activity, beyond the offerings  
of just one organization. They show the connections be-  
tween people, places, and things, and they aid in the design  
of ­ ecosystems.  
In other words, experience maps as defined here have a  
completely different point of view than, say, customer journey  
maps. Rather than seeing the individual as a consumer of a  
brand or offering, you can instead focus on their objectives  
and goals regardless of the solution.  
For instance, consider the diagram in Figure 12-1, created  
by Sarah Brooks, chief design officer at the US Department  
CHAPTER 12  
# Experience Maps  
of Veteran Affairs.\* This is a map of a military veteran’s life  
experiences, reflecting a wide range of disparate goals and  
objectives over time. There is no “Awareness” or “Purchase”  
phase here because the map takes a different point of view  
from a classic customer journey map. This diagram tells a story  
of experiences, not a story of transactions. It’s quite literally  
the life story of a military service member.  
Consider also the map shown in Figure 12-2, created by  
design strategist Diego S. Bernardo. His aim was to illustrate  
the ups and downs of growing food in the city. Negative  
experiences \(in red\) indicate reasons why someone might  
stop the activity. Dropout points are indicated with red lines  
pointing down.  
The positive experiences \(in blue\) show the good things about  
growing food in the city. This diagram reminds us to look not  
only for pain points, struggles, and fears in an experience,

tizen-Centered Design Is Changing the Ways the Government Serves the  
People,” Fast Company \(Jul 2016\).

313FIGURE 12-3. An experience map can compare several personas mapped to the same timeline in one overview.  
314 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps but also aspects that motivate and encourage. The loops in  
the diagram indicate positive feedback loops and increased  
engagement throughout the experience.  
Overall, the diagram in Figure 12-2 tells the story of an indi-  
vidual’s relationship to an activity—urban gardening—not  
the relationship to a product, service, or brand. Importantly,  
looking at the experience in this way points to opportunities.  
Rather than illustrating how individuals consume a product,  
experience maps allow organizations to ask the question,  
“How do we fit into the lives of individuals?” The answers  
often lead to new opportunities for growth.  
It’s also possible for a single experience map to show the ex-  
periences of multiple actors. The example in Figure 12-3 was  
created by Tarun Upaday, cofounder and CEO of Gallop.ai  
\(gallop.ai\), an AI-powered travel assistance service. It aligns  
three separate personas to a common timeline, in this case for  
traveling. To enable comparison across the different traveler  
types, each row has the same types of descriptive informa-  
tion\: goals, pain points, and forces \(or motivating factors that  
drive behavior\).  
# Hybrid Experience Maps  
But be warned\: although I have a fairly strict definition of an  
experience map, as outlined above, in many cases the use of  
the term experience map overlaps significantly with custom-  
er journey map. In practice, the two terms are often used  
interchangeably. You may even find a mashup of terminology,  
with phrases such as “customer experience maps” and “expe-  
rience journeys.”  
Commercially oriented experience maps combine a view of  
the individual’s fundamental experience with a specific solu-  
tion. For instance, one of the earliest examples of an experi-  
ence map comes from Gene Smith and Trevor von Gorp of  
nForm, a leading experience design agency in Canada. Figure  
12-4 shows their map for a video game enthusiast.  
This map includes a clear “Purchase” phase, signaling that it’s  
a consumer journey, although the purchase is not the focus  
of the diagram. Smith describes how their motivation was to  
understand the context of gaming in greater depth in his blog  
post titled “Experience Maps\: Understanding Cross-Channel  
Experiences for Gamers.” He writes\:  
The solution we came up with was an experience  
map—a diagram that combines a persona with an  
abstracted story about the gamer’s journey from  
researching games to purchasing, playing to sharing  
experiences about that game. The story includes the  
details on the different channels where gamers get  
their information along with supporting quotes from  
our research.  
Hybrid Experience Maps 315FIGURE 12-4. This experience map for social gamers shows a clear chronology from left to right.  
316 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps Hybrid Experience Maps 317FIGURE 12-5. This map captures visitors’ experiences visiting the Exploratorium in a single overview.  
318 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps Experience maps fundamentally recognize that people interact  
with many products and services from a multitude of provid-  
ers in many situations. These experiences shape their behav-  
iors and their relationship with any one organization. Exam-  
ining this broader context will become increasingly crucial as  
products and services become connected.  
Figure 12-5 shows another example of an experience map—in  
this case, visiting a museum called the Exploratorium—created  
by Brandon Schauer and designers at Adaptive Path. There is  
no purchase decision phase in this diagram, as would be ex-  
pected in a customer journey map. Rather, it seeks to illustrate  
the actions and thoughts of museum goers, both inside and  
outside of the museum. Though much of this map could apply  
to visiting any museum, it centers on an experience with a spe-  
cific one, the Exploratorium. Hence, I call this a hybrid map.  
Experience maps—whether hybrid or not—help provide an  
outside-in view of your organization. For instance, working  
through the diagramming process had a positive impact on  
the Exploratorium team, as Schauer indicates\:  
What we found impressive was how quickly this  
diverse group aligned by using the maps on a small set  
of opportunities that could yield the most impact on  
the visitor experience.\*  
With maps as a centerpiece for the conversation, the team  
was able to find consensus and alignment.

# Related Models  
Experience maps are concerned with how the provider’s offer-  
ing fits into a person’s experience, not the other way around.  
They provide a view of a given domain from the user’s  
perspective. Related types of diagrams also take this point of  
view, including day-in-the-life-diagrams, workflow diagrams,  
and job maps.  
# Day-in-the-Life Diagrams  
One common way to map the experiences an individual has  
is to create a so-called day-in-the-life diagram. As the name  
implies, these maps illustrate a typical day or “average” of  
typical days.  
Figure 12-6 shows an example of a day-in-the-life diagram  
created by Stuart Karten of Karten Design. It highlights the  
different modes of thinking an individual goes through during  
a day, indicated by the different colors. For this reason, Karten  
calls this approach “mode mapping.” For instance, in Figure  
12-6, information seeking is indicated in light blue and com-  
municating with others is in dark purple. The line of modes  
extending across the diagram moves up or down to reflect  
positive or negative emotional states, respectively.  
Related Models 319FIGURE 12-6. A day-in-the-life diagram can reflect the different physical, cognitive, and emotional modes a person goes through in a day.  
320 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps Related Models 321In the second edition of their book Contextual Design, Karen  
Holtzblatt and Hugh Beyer recommend using day-in-the-life  
models to show how people complete an activity in the real  
world. They suggest building up the diagram over time as you  
conduct research. In this sense, a day-in-the-life diagram is  
also a type of data-gathering mechanism.  
For example, if you’re investigating how people commute to  
work, Holtzblatt and Beyer suggest setting up a simple frame-  
work like the one shown in Figure 12-7. As insights emerge,  
U01 Day in the life

FIGURE 12-7. Holtzblatt and Beyer recommend capturing real-world  
insights about an individual’s day-in-the-life story with a simple framework  
as you conduct research.  
322 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps  
you can add them to the chart until a full story emerges and  
you can consolidate the information into a single model,  
such as the one in this figure. “Capture little life stories—real  
instances not abstractions,” they recommend.  
Day-in-the life diagrams can easily be combined with personas  
to help gain empathy. They typically include struggles and  
challenges that the individual has to overcome but can’t. The  
aim is to show types of work and tasks, their frequency, and  
how they interlock during a typical day. Insights can be gained  
about context switching and other workflow patterns that  
can be optimized.  
I’ve found that when interviewing people about a typical day,  
you’ll very often get the answer\: “I don’t have a typical day.”  
In that case, ask what they did yesterday and then compare  
that to previous days until a pattern emerges.  
Alternatively, to get around the difficulty of discussing a  
single typical day, you can map out a typical week. This gives  
a broader view of how activities interlock to form an over-  
all workflow.  
Figure 12-8 shows a typical work week diagram for litigation  
lawyers in France, created while I was working at LexisNexis  
on a project described more fully later in this chapter. Despite  
hearing frequently that there is no “typical day,” some overar-  
ching patterns emerged. The people in our study tended to be  
away at court in the mornings, saw clients in the afternoon,  
and worked after hours to catch up on client matter work  
and research. FIGURE 12-8. To avoid having to find a typical day to map—something participants are often unable to describe—consider a typical work week.  
Related Models 323FIGURE 12-9. The experience map shows a one-year journey of a person playing a health behavior change game.  
324 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps Unlike customer journey maps, which break an experience  
into phases that may be of varying lengths and even have  
repeated or ongoing interactions, day-in-the-life diagrams or  
week-in-the-life diagrams appear in a strict chronology mea-  
sured by specific units of time. In Figures 12-6 and 12-8, the  
unit is hours of a day. Think of these diagrams as portraying a  
specific scenario in a mini-storyboard fashion.  
You can also extend the  
chronology to tell a story  
across a broader period of  
time. Consider the perspec-  
tive taken in the diagram in  
Figure 12-9, created by Jamie  
Thomson of Mad\*Pow, which illustrates the experience of  
reducing cholesterol over the course of a year. There is a clear,  
linear journey of equal units of time, measured in months in  
this case. Though not a day-in-the-life diagram by definition  
\(i.e., it’s not a day\), this diagram has a similar narrative extend-  
ed over a year.  
# Workflow Diagrams  
Related to experience maps, workflow diagrams break down  
the steps taken to achieve a goal. These diagrams focus on  
how a sequence of tasks fits together, often among multiple  
actors. They are more akin to service blueprints than customer  
journey maps.  
A swim lane diagram is a specific type of document that is  
widely used to show workflow. Typically, these diagrams show  
# Experience maps allow organizations  
# to ask the question, “How do we  
# fit into the lives of individuals?”  
the steps of an interaction between a user and different parts  
of a system in a very mechanical way. The columns or rows  
of the diagram—depending on its orientation—make up the  
“swim lanes.” This aids in seeing different actors and compo-  
nents in an interaction.  
Figure 12-10 shows a typical swim lane diagram with parallel  
actions with a system—in this case, for the workflow of plac-  
ing a purchase order with a  
sales agent.  
It’s clear that this diagram  
does not explicitly include  
contextual information or  
details about customer emo-  
tions. Instead, swim lane diagrams focus on the flow of tasks,  
materials, and information chronologically. Often, a workflow  
diagram may accompany an experience map to show detailed  
interactions of a specific phase within a broader context.  
Swim lane diagrams can be expanded to include information  
about an individual’s experience. Figure 12-11 shows an exam-  
ple diagram created by Yvonne Shek of nForm that includes  
a graphic storyboard and details about the person involved in  
the interaction. This approach extends the swim lane tech-  
nique by adding experiential context.  
While employed at LexisNexis, a provider of legal news and  
business information, I led an effort to map the workflow of  
lawyers in five international markets—France, Australia, New  
Zealand, Germany, and Austria.  
Related Models 325The approach in each country was to follow the lifecycle of a  
client matter from the perspective of the lawyer. We wanted  
to understand the complex series of actions lawyers take to  
complete a client matter, from beginning to end. This was  
strategically relevant for the business at the time.

After reviewing existing research and speaking with business  
stakeholders in each country, I conducted many interviews  
with customers in our market. From this investigation, I was  
able to create detailed workflow diagrams for each region.  
The diagrams included three different types of  
actors simultaneously\: lawyers, secretaries, and  
all other actors in the workflow. As a result,  
they consisted of many rows of information,  
seen labeled on the left side of Figure 12-12.  
This diagram represents only a small portion  
of the overall workflow, which was about 20  
times this excerpt in length.  
Pain points and goals are also included, as  
well as notes on state of mind and emotion.  
Personas, typical workweek charts \(like the one  
in Figure 12-8\), and org charts accompanied  
the diagrams for a complete description of the  
lawyer’s experience.  
I led several workshops to review the diagrams  
in detail with each country’s business unit  
leads. Together, we found new opportunities  
for improvement and growth. Overall, the  
workflow mapping efforts in each country  
provided a deep view into the daily experience  
of lawyers.

328 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps  
**No** Jobs Maps  
The concept of jobs to be done provides a lens through which  
to understand value creation. The framework looks at cus-  
tomer motivations in business settings. The term was made  
popular by business leader Clayton Christensen in his book  
The Innovator’s Solution, the follow-up to his landmark work  
The Innovator’s Dilemma. It’s a straightforward principle\: peo-  
ple “hire” products and services to get a job done.  
For instance, you might hire a new suit to make you look  
good at a job interview. Or, you hire Facebook to stay in  
touch with friends daily. You could also hire a chocolate bar to  
relieve stress. These are all jobs to be done.  
From this perspective, people are seen as goal-driven individ-  
uals seeking to achieve some desired outcome. ­ Supporting  
those outcomes is ultimately the value that organiza-  
tions ­ create.  
Tony Ulwick has done some of the most advanced work  
in applying “jobs to be done” theory in practice. His com-  
pany, Strategyn, bases its consulting offering on jobs to be  
done. Together with his colleague Lance Bettencourt, Ulwick  
proposes a model for understanding jobs to be done as a  
sequence of steps. They call these job maps.  
\*  
A person’s job to be done can be seen as a process, which  
according to Ulwick and Bettencourt has universal stages  
\(shown in Figure 12-13\)\:  
Define Locate Prepare Confirm  
Execute Monitor Modify Conclude  
FIGURE 12-13. The  
job map, as proposed by  
Bettencourt and Ulwick, has  
eight universal phases, which  
can be customized to specific  
situations.

Map,” Harvard Business Review \(May 2008\).

planning the approach to getting the job done.  
2\. Locate\: Before beginning, people must locate inputs,  
gather items, and find information needed to do the job.  
3\. Prepare\: In this step, people set up the environment and  
organize materials.  
4\. Confirm\: Here, individuals make sure the materials and  
the environment are properly prepared.  
5\. Execute\: In this step, individuals perform the job as  
planned. From their perspective, this is the most critical  
step in the job map.  
6\. Monitor\: People evaluate the success of the job as it is  
being executed.  
7\. Modify\: Modifications, alterations, and iterations may be  
necessary to complete a job.  
8\. Conclude\: This step refers to all of the actions taken to  
complete and wrap up the job.  
These stages are not necessarily meant to be labels in a job  
map diagram, but rather categories of steps that might be in-  
cluded. Think of the universal job map categories as a kind of  
reminder to cover the entire process, from beginning to end.

330 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps  
With a job map in hand, organizations can better create prod-  
ucts and services that people actually need. Bettencourt and  
Ulwick urge teams to use job maps collaboratively to identi-  
fy opportunities\:  
With a job map in hand, you can begin to look  
systematically for opportunities to create value. … A  
great way to begin is to consider the biggest draw-  
backs of current solutions at each step in the map—in  
particular, drawbacks related to speed of execution,  
variability, and the quality of output. To increase the  
effectiveness of this approach, invite a diverse team  
of experts—marketing, design, engineering, and even  
some lead customers—to participate in this discussion.  
Innovation opportunities can come at any step in the job map.  
Consider these examples\:  
•  
WW \(Weight Watchers\) streamlines the “Define” stage  
with a system that does not require calorie counting.  
•  
To gather items during the “Locate” step while moving  
house, U-Haul provides customers with kits that include  
different types of boxes that may be needed.  
•  
Nike helps joggers evaluate the success of the job in  
the “Monitor” step with a sensor in the running shoe  
that provides feedback about time, distance, pace, and  
calories burned via a connection to an iPhone or Apple  
Watch.  
•  
Browser-based SaaS software updates automatically so  
users don’t have to install new versions, thereby reducing  
complexity in the “Modify” step. Figure 12-14 shows an example of a job map for the main job  
of retrieving scientific information. Notice that there are no  
emotional or aspirational elements. Job maps focus solely on  
the steps of getting a job done. Desired outcomes, emotion-  
al jobs, and social jobs—while critical to understand—are  
gathered elsewhere and handled separately. A job map is the  
bare-bones process described in the preceding steps.  
Because both job maps and experience maps are based on a  
chronology that is independent of any technology or solu-  
tion, you can use the former as the basis of the latter. That is,  
create a simple job map with the bare-bones steps, as seen  
in Figure 12-14. Then, arrange it in a swim-lane fashion on  
the page and add rows below or above that chronology to  
include more experiential and emotional aspects of a journey.

The elements of experience maps are very similar to those of  
a customer journey map, although experience maps tend to  
be even more free-form, with facets of information included  
or not depending on the story being told. Conventions are  
emerging, however. Typical elements of experience maps  
include some or all of the following\:  
•  
Phases of behavior  
•  
Actions and steps taken  
•  
Jobs to be done, goals, or needs  
•  
Thoughts and questions  
•  
Emotions and state of mind  
•  
Pain points  
•  
Physical artifacts and devices  
•  
Opportunities  
Experience maps tend to break away from a focus on the  
purchasing decision—a key distinguishing factor of custom-  
er journey maps. Although a purchase may be part of the  
experience, the focus of an experience map is not necessarily  
making a decision.

ence maps using the framework outlined in Chapter 2.

# Mapping the Domestic Violence Journey  
by Dr. Karen Wood  
Domestic violence is a widespread problem that causes suffer-  
ing throughout Canada, where I’m from, and indeed around the  
world. Approximately two-thirds of the Canadian population  
either have personally experienced or know at least one woman  
who has experienced physical or sexual abuse. And 70% of  
children who have witnessed spousal violence saw or heard  
assaults against their mothers. In the worst cases, victims are  
murdered—at a rate of one woman every six days in Canada.  
In the majority of these cases, the perpetrator is male and is ei-  
ther known to or directly related to the victim. There is a widely  
held belief that the Domestic Violence Service System \(DVSS\),  
responsible for keeping women safe, is failing to adequately  
protect them.  
However, research shows that the majority of domestic violence  
incidents are never reported. Quantitative data thus does not  
tell the whole story. The circumstances around any one domes-  
tic violence case are complex, involving decisions, failures, and  
errors that unfold over time.  
Together with a team of psychologists, the DVSS saw an oppor-  
tunity to better understand and fight domestic violence using  
mapping techniques. We wanted to investigate the broader system  
of interactions, decisions, and emotions that typically lead up to  
critical events, as well as understand what happens afterward.  
The domestic violence system is multifaceted, with multiple en-  
try points and multiple factors that play a role throughout the  
journey. For instance, it’s very common for rural women not to  
leave their homes. There is also a multitude of support services  
available, from government agencies to nonprofit providers.  
Navigating this system alone is a challenge for victims.  
FIGURE 12-15. Mapping the domestic violence journey made use of a  
preformatted grid, colored pens, and sticky notes to illustrate individual  
experiences.  
334 Chapter 12\: Experience Maps So how do victims make sense of it all? What identifiable patterns  
can we learn from to help prevent domestic violence in general?  
We set off to explore these deep waters in context through journey  
mapping. It was clear that we could no longer afford to focus our  
evaluation efforts only on the individual parts of the system, but  
needed to have an end-to-end overview. We wanted to know,  
what does it feel like to travel through the domestic violence sys-  
tem, focusing on the interaction with support services?  
Note that the process we took was well controlled with trained  
domestic violence experts and psychologists leading the effort. When  
mapping traumatic and emotional events, it’s critical your participants  
and your team are safe and feel safe. Do not try this on your own!  
We invited seven women to our sessions. These were held in safe  
rooms that were guarded and had an escape exit separate from  
the entrance where they came in. A clinical psychologist led the  
interviews, and I guided the mapping activity.  
To make it simple, we laid out a grid in advance that was presented  
to each woman in the study. Participants began at the start of their  
journeys, indicating steps, needs, expected actions, stress levels,  
and their thoughts and emotions at each point \(Figure 12-15\). We  
continued to build the journey map as we talked through their  
experience with domestic violence as it unfolded.  
# Findings  
One of the biggest surprises of this project was the number of ser-  
vices the women interacted with—a combined total of 61 services  
and supports were identified. On average, women experiencing  
domestic violence interacted with 22 different services or supports.  
We found three typical domestic violence journey stages across all  
participants\:  
•  
Journey type I\: Living with the perpetrator. At this point,  
victims need basic safety information, as well as validation  
by others to address their fears.  
•  
Journey type II\: Living away from the perpetrator. Victims  
need help navigating the system and access to resources  
after they’ve left the home of the perpetrator. They are  
driven by a desire for personal change and empowerment.  
•  
Journey type III\: Perpetrator removed from home. In latter  
stages of the journey, victims need financial and emotional  
support. They seek compassion and understanding from  
others.  
We mapped these types to various service interactions and aspects  
of the domestic violence ecosystem, as shown in Figure 12-16. Each  
service category has a separate code in this diagram, allowing the  
research team to gain a relative sense of perceived value. Overall,  
the research showed that the system was fairly robust and offered  
honesty, but the victims ultimately wanted more compassion.  
One very important unintended outcome of the mapping sessions  
was that victims indicated that the mapping process was empower-  
ing. We left them alone with their illustrated journeys so they could  
each make better sense of their own journey. Many of the women  
thanked us for helping them understand the buildup to a cata-  
strophic event and how to move forward after it happened.  
Overall, the study was a success. Experience mapping proved  
to be an effective tool, enabling us to rank service effectiveness

across the journey rather than on an individual basis. This gave the  
research team a more holistic view of the victims’ experiences. As  
Donella Meadows, author of the book Thinking in Systems, has  
said\: “The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing  
the elements of which the system is made.”

■ Background and overview of mental models  
■ Rapid mental model diagrams  
■ Deriving structure  
■ Elements of mental model diagrams  
■ Case study\: A mental model for a forward-thinking insurance company The term mental model has its roots in psychology. It refers  
to someone’s thought process about how the world works—  
their frame of reality.  
Mental models allow us to predict how things work. They are  
cognitive constructs built on beliefs, assumptions, and past  
experiences. But a person’s mental model is a perception  
of how a system functions, not necessarily how it actually  
may work.  
For instance, say you come into your house in the US on a  
cold day. To get warmed up quickly, you turn the thermostat  
way up. Your assumption is that the higher the thermostat  
setting is, the more heat will come out.  
But an American thermostat does not work like a faucet valve.  
It’s more like a switch\: the heat goes on or off depending on  
whether the set temperature has been reached \(see Figure  
13-1\). In this scenario, your mental model of how the system  
works is wrong. The room won’t get warmer faster if you turn  
the temperature setting up. Instead, the heater will simply stay  
on longer, until the house reaches the desired temperature.  
CHAPTER 13  
# Mental Model Diagrams  
The lesson for providers of products or services is profound\:  
your understanding of the systems you create differs from the  
users’ understanding. You have far more knowledge about  
how the system actually works than others do.

339The difference in mental models is a key point Don Norman  
makes in his landmark book The Design of Everyday Things.  
Figure 13-2 shows his now-iconic graphic of three different  
models at play\: the model the designer has of the system, the  
actual system model, and the mental model the user has of  
the system.  
The goal of design is to understand the mental model of the  
people you are designing for. To do this, you need a feedback  
loop, indicated by the two arrows on the right side of Figure  
13-2\. It requires the ability to put your perspective to the side

model is not the same as the user’s mental model.  
340 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams  
and to view the system as a user might. In a word, designing  
requires empathy .  
The diagrams explored in this book help you understand the  
feedback loop between the user and the system. The mental  
model the user has of the system is framed by that system.  
If you explore the mental model of a person who is trying to  
achieve a purpose, rather than a user of your system, then  
you can break out of the system frame. You can discover  
aspects of how a person thinks that have nothing to do with  
the system, but everything to do with how that person ac-  
complishes their intent.  
Mapping is a key way to understand mental models and  
make them visible to your organization. In practice, mapping  
experiences is effectively mapping someone’s mental model.  
The approach discussed in this chapter focuses on a specific  
technique developed by Indi Young, called the mental mod-  
el diagram. Diagramming Mental Models  
In 2008, Indi Young published a formal method for visualizing  
mental models in her book of the same name. Figure 13-3  
shows an example of a mental model used in the book. This  
instance examines “movie going.”  
Mental model diagrams are typically very long documents  
and can extend 10–15 feet across a wall when printed. The  
diagram in Figure 13-3 has been broken into two parts to fit  
on the page.  
The top half of the diagram describes the mental model  
patterns across a set of people. There are three basic levels of  
information in this portion of the diagram \(Figure 13-4\)\:  
Boxes  
These are the basic building blocks, shown as small  
squares. The boxes contain a person’s thoughts, reac-  
tions, and guiding principles. \(Originally, Young referred  
to these as “tasks,” but she has since moved away from  
that language to avoid confusion with physical actions  
only.\)  
Towers  
Boxes form groups based on affinity, called towers. These  
are the areas with colored backgrounds in the diagram.  
Mental spaces  
Towers, in turn, form affinity clusters called mental  
spaces. These are delineated with dark vertical lines and  
labeled above the towers.  
A dark horizontal line in the center of the diagram separates  
the mental model from “support”—all of the products and  
services that address the thought process within a tower.  
From this arrangement, we see the basic principles of align-  
ment at work.  
Overall, this approach of describing mental models focuses on  
people, not tools. For instance, instead of writing “Filter im-  
age colors in Photoshop,” focus on the root task, which might  
be “Alter image colors” or “Improve image color.”  
The diagrams also don’t reflect personal preference or opin-  
ion. Instead, you should strive to focus on what goes through  
a person’s mind—their internal voice—and capture that in  
your diagram.  
As a result, of all the diagrams covered in this book, the top  
half of a mental model diagram is the most person-focused in  
nature. This provides an advantage in terms of flexibility\: these  
diagrams can be applied to any domain or situation. Mental  
model diagrams also enjoy longevity\: once completed, a men-  
tal model will change only slowly, often remaining relevant  
for years.  
One risk with mental model diagrams is that they may over-  
whelm others with detail. I have seen business leaders ask for  
a simpler model. However, that detail is also a strength for  
those looking to deeply understand people’s state of mind.

344 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams Combing the Transcripts  
The process for creating mental model diagrams is similar to  
the steps outlined in Chapters 5–8 of this book. One main  
difference is the normalization of research findings into a  
standard format. This normalization makes the process of  
finding affinities between items much easier.  
You begin the analysis by combing interview transcripts  
for relevant information. The time spent combing gives the  
researcher a much stronger understanding of what each par-  
ticipant meant. This process stands at the heart of the mental  
model technique. For every element in the diagram, follow a  
similar format\:  
1\. Start with a verb, to focus on the thinking, rather than  
the goal.  
2\. Use the first person to put yourself in the participant’s  
shoes.  
3\. Add one idea per box, for simplicity and clarity.  
Each element comes from the thinking you hear from partici-  
pants. If you record the listening session and get a transcript,  
you can draw each element from the transcript as a quote. To  
make it easier to find affinities between the elements, write a  
summary of each quote using this form\:  
\[I \(optional\)\] \[verb\] \[noun\] \[qualifiers\]  
This strict uniformity allows for the arrangement of elements  
hierarchically\: boxes are grouped into towers, towers are  
grouped into mental spaces. The process begins with distilling  
elements from the transcripts. The aim is to get the essence of  
people’s mental models into the prescribed format.  
Formatting tasks takes practice. It’s not merely a process of  
copying phrases from the raw texts gathered during research.  
To illustrate, Table 13-1 shows some hypothetical quotes  
about drinking coffee. On the right are example summaries in  
the prescribed format that you might derive from this data.

think I can almost do that in my

Diagramming Mental Models 345Rapid Mental Model Method  
Creating a mental model diagram can take a lot of effort. For-  
mal projects with 20–30 participants take weeks or months  
to complete. It’s a valuable up-front investment, but some  
organizations don’t want to take the time.  
After Mental Models was published, Young developed a meth-  
od for creating diagrams quickly—within days. She describes  
this approach in a blog post titled “Try the ‘Lightning Quick’  
Method.” It centers on a single workshop with stakeholders.  
Here is a summary of Young’s rapid approach to gathering  
data and finding affinities\:  
1\. Solicit stories in advance.  
Collect short stories about a particular topic from your  
target audience a week in advance. This can be done  
through email or short listening sessions, as well as via  
social media and other online sources. The stories are  
accounts of how people reason their way toward a pur-  
pose, captured on one to two pages. If you need to,  
rewrite these stories using the first person so all of the  
texts have a similar perspective.  
2\. Comb and summarize.  
Read through the stories aloud in the workshop. Using  
large sticky notes or working in a shared document, have  
different team members record summaries as you read.  
Within a few hours, you should be able to produce one  
hundred discrete summaries.  
346 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams  
3\. Group by patterns.  
Once the summaries begin to accumulate, start grouping  
them by the intent of the story writer. Many of these first  
groups will change as you add summaries. As you get fur-  
ther in, you can begin to organize the towers into mental  
spaces. You should be able to create a provisional struc-  
ture within an afternoon.  
4\. Brainstorm.  
Use the remainder of the workshop to brainstorm solu-  
tions. Where are the gaps between how people are rea-  
soning and how your organization supports that reason-  
ing? What opportunities do you see?  
The rapid method is ideal for teams that need to act on  
results quickly. The result is a first-generation diagram that  
reflects what you have collected at this point. It may need  
further validation. But since people’s stories are collected up  
front, this diagram is nonetheless grounded in reality.  
# From Construct to Structure  
The hierarchical nature of mental model diagrams makes  
them particularly relevant to the practice of information  
architecture. The process can be described as grounded\: a  
bottom-up approach starting with summaries of how people  
describe their reasoning, reactions, and guiding principles as  
they accomplish a purpose larger than your offering. Then, it’s  
a matter of successively grouping information into higher-level  
categories \(Figure 13-5\). The result is a categorization that matches the actual mental  
model of the people you serve and reflects the vocabulary  
that people have used in interviews. App and web designers,  
for example, can then use this scheme as the basis for naviga-  
tion. This greatly improves the usability of the navigation and  
ensures its longevity as well.  
Young describes the process of deriving structure and map-  
ping it to navigation in detail. Figure 13-6 is an example of  
the process outlined in her book. It shows how mental spaces  
can be grouped into categories that then serve as the main  
navigation for a website.

# Related Approaches  
The origins of investigation into mental models date back to  
the work of Kenneth Craik in his 1943 book The Nature of  
Explanation. He offers a concise, simple-to-understand defini-  
tion of mental models\:  
The mind constructs small-scale models of reality to an-  
ticipate events, to reason, and to underlie explanation.  
Later, Philip Johnson-Laird did some of the most significant  
research on the subject, resulting in the publication of a full-  
length book titled Mental Models in 1983. Early attempts  
at representing mental models visually reflect a hierarchical  
arrangement of information. For instance, Johnson-Laird’s  
approach looked at how a meaningful story builds up across  
events and episodes. His approach was grounded in textual  
analysis, which he then visualized \(Figure 13-7\).  
Broadly speaking, this represents the technique of ladder-  
ing\: showing layers of causality from granular evidence to  
high-level conclusions. Mental model diagrams are also based  
on a type of laddering.  
Consider the laddering in the goals-means framework, shown  
in Figure 13-8. This shows a hierarchy of goals and means for  
pregnancy, created by designer Beth Kyle. At the top is the  
primary goal of having a healthy child and mother. The means  
of achieving that are listed on the next level. The process  
iterates until specific solutions and features are determined at  
the lowest level.  
348 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams FIGURE 13-7. An example of a diagram by Philip Johnson-Laird reflects the hierarchical nature of mental model analysis.  
In another example, Figure 13-9 shows the new business  
activities of an architectural firm. This is a diagram I created  
during a previous project, modified to conceal the identities of  
both the firm and our client.  
Because new business activities can happen in any order,  
using a hierarchical representation made sense in this case. It  
allowed me to show relationships between actions without  
putting them on a timeline. Through laddering, higher-level  
goals and needs can then be identified.

# ­ Diagrams  
Of the types presented in Part 3 of this book, mental model  
diagrams represent an archetype for hierarchical illustrations.  
Indi Young’s book provides a step-by-step guide to creating  
these diagrams, as well as tips on ways to use them in practice.  
Broadly speaking, mental model diagrams reflect the concept  
of laddering—a grounded, bottom-up approach to creating  
models of human experiences based on observations.  
Table 13-2 summarizes the main aspects that define mental  
model diagrams using the framework outlined in Chapter 2.  
TABLE 13-2. Defining aspects of mental model diagrams.  
Point of  
view  
Thoughts, emotions, and guiding principles  
that go through a person’s mind in a given  
context as they achieve a purpose.  
Structure Hierarchical.  
Scope Very broad and inclusive of multiple  
perspectives across individuals.  
Focus Behavior, reasoning, beliefs, and philosophies  
of individuals.  
The support organizations offer.  
Uses To develop empathy by understanding what  
goes through people’s minds.  
To find opportunities for innovation based on  
a deep understanding of human behavior.  
To derive navigation and high-level  
information architecture.  
To guide the flow of your offering so that it  
supports the thinking captured in the diagram.  
Strengths Normalized formats provide consistent results.  
Deep insight into human thinking with respect  
to the scope of the purpose the person is  
trying to achieve.  
Weaknesses Final diagrams can be overwhelming in detail.  
Lack of chronological flow.

Elements of Mental Model ­ Diagrams 353CASE STUDY  
# A Mental Model for a Forward-Thinking Insurance Company  
by Indi Young  
This particular case study represents a common scenario where  
a product or service already exists, and the organization is  
seeking a way to make incremental improvements.  
The example organization is an insurance company.\* The compa-  
ny offers auto insurance and home insurance. There is a group  
within the company, separate from any of these businesses,  
tasked with strategic direction and new products. The group was  
created two years ago by a few of the executives in response to  
discussions in the boardroom about competition and innovation;  
they wanted to experiment with something beyond traditional  
industrial methods. This group has conducted a few person-fo-  
cused studies, one of which was about what goes through  
people’s minds during and immediately after an auto accident.  
Because of what they discovered, the group suspects there might  
be something to learn from thinking patterns during near misses.  
They want to conduct another study as a twin to the accident  
study, so they have a stronger foundation from which to de-  
velop their potential ideas for new directions. The group hopes  
to use the discoveries to guide the way the company provides  
services to the individuals it insures.  
The scope of their subsequent study is\: What was on your  
mind during and after a memorable near-miss accident? This  
scope is not restricted by the type or location of the incident.  
The team will hear stories from people who have nearly had  
accidents in the kitchen or on the road, by themselves or in a  
crowd, where someone is at fault or no one is at fault. Because  
this is person-focused research, the accident does not have to  
relate to the product—home and auto insurance—that the  
company provides. The goal is to gather information on ways  
of thinking and manners of decision making during a near miss,  
whether or not it has to do with automobiles. The patterns of  
thinking can then be used as a framework for new ideas about  
auto insurance.  
# Near-Miss Accidents  
The team began by conducting listening sessions with 24 peo-  
ple. They began each session with the question, “What was on  
your mind during and after a memorable near-miss accident?”  
Then they let the participant take the conversation wherever  
they wanted, within that scope.  
Here is the first part of one of the stories. The listener digs into  
various things that were mentioned so as to better understand  
the reasoning and reactions that went through the participant’s  
mind at the time.  
354 \*  
Because it’s difficult to get legal permission to use genuine studies and  
transcripts, the insurance company case study is fake. The 24 participant  
stories that were collected are true, but the ideas that emerged from the  
findings were invented based on a foundation of two decades’ experience.  
Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams 17\: Bracket Fell Off the Work Truck—Transcript  
Listener\: I’m looking for stories that will help me understand  
what goes through people’s minds in near accidents or  
injuries. Do you have any near accidents or near injuries that  
you remember?  
Speaker\: I guess this counts as a near accident, because it  
was an actual accident, but it could have been much worse.  
So I think it counts as both. It wasn’t recent—it must have  
been when my daughter was four or five. These don’t have to  
be car things, right?  
Listener\: Right.  
Speaker\: This is one of those things when you’re driving on  
the freeway, and you’re going 65 miles per hour. I was right  
behind a fencing company truck. An aluminum bracket tum-  
bled off the little storage cabinet above the truck. I wasn’t  
even that close behind it—just a normal distance. I was driv-  
ing my Honda Odyssey, and the bracket struck the windshield  
right in front of my face. Instant spiderweb! It was one of  
those things that happen in a flash. I had all this adrenaline.  
So, I’m going to pull up to this other car and tell them to pull  
over. So I get in the other lane and I pull up next to them. I  
look over and it is four men, and three of them are asleep!  
I’ve got to stop them to get their insurance. I was gesticulat-  
ing at them. There was another some sort of a service car,  
or some sort of county-related government car. I tried to flag  
them down, and they just looked confused. Finally, I drove  
home and looked at it. Boy, am I glad for tempered glass.  
If this had happened 50 years ago, I would be dead. And  
my daughter was in the car seat in the back going, “What’s  
going on, mom?”  
Listener\: Wow! Yes, thank goodness for tempered glass.  
That’s so scary to think about! You said the word “adrena-  
line.” What do you mean?  
Speaker\: That’s the part where you kind of panic a little bit.  
Everything’s happening fast but sort of slow at the same  
time. Your heart’s beating fast, and you’re not quite sure  
what the right thing to do is, but you have to do something.  
You have a smidgeon of common sense to not veer off the  
road. But this sort of thing has never happened before, so  
some of the adrenaline is from being in unfamiliar water. I  
wasn’t sure what to do next. Maybe I should get the name  
of the company. I tried to get the license plate. I remember  
looking them up on the internet when I got home. I was  
thinking, “Can I just call them and tell them, ‘You guys did  
this to my car’?” I was upset.  
Listener\: You were upset?  
Speaker\: It’s a good \$500 when something happens to your  
car! But the adrenaline was also knowing it could have  
been worse. You just get scared. Everything on that truck  
should have been packed up and strapped down. This stuff  
happens all the time, though, which is what’s scary. In a  
perfect world, nothing would ever happen like this. So it was  
adrenaline to do something\: fight or flee. Or a little of both.  
\[laughs\]  
# CASE STUDY  
Case Study\: A Mental Model for a Forward-Thinking Insurance Company﻿ 355CASE STUDY  
Listener\: You say you looked them up on the internet when  
you got home?  
Speaker\: I looked them up to make sure it was a company.  
I thought about calling them, but what would I have said?  
How can I prove that anything happened? It happened on a  
freeway going 65 miles per hour. There were no witnesses.  
All I have is a car that needs a new windshield and is undriv-  
able. I decided I guess there’s nothing I can do about this,  
except chalk it up to one of life’s experiences. Try to learn  
from it. Never drive behind a work truck like that. Tell my  
teenagers never to drive behind a truck. There are all sorts  
of scary scenarios; you can drive yourself crazy with it. When  
my husband got home he said I got lucky. He said, “That was  
in a really bad spot. You could have really gotten hurt.”  
Listener\: What was going through your mind when he told  
you that?  
Speaker\: That I completely agree, “Yeah, you’re right.” “Oh  
yeah, it wasn’t just my imagination.” It was a validation. I am  
as lucky as I think I am.  
356 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams  
# Writing Summaries  
After collecting the stories, the team sat down to go over the de-  
tails in the written transcripts. Making sense of what a person said  
from the transcript provided them double the depth of understand-  
ing than simply listening. It involved corralling messy, meandering  
dialog, picking out certain quotes to put with other parts of this  
person’s dialogue, and forging a better idea of what they meant  
to convey. This work allowed the team to absorb participants’  
thoughts, reactions, and philosophies. The team developed deep  
cognitive empathy with the participants.  
Here are some example quotes the team worked through. They  
strung together several quotes from one transcript that represented  
the same concept, jotted down whether it was reasoning/thinking,  
a reaction, or a guiding principle, tried out a few verbs that could  
possibly star as the first scintillating word of the summary, and  
then wrote the summary for that concept.  
Maybe I should get the name of the company. … get the  
license plate. … if that happened to someone else, and they  
were telling me about it, I’d ask, “Who did it?” … to get  
information about them … I remember looking them up on  
the internet when I got home. … I looked them up to make  
sure it was a company.  
\(thinking\) Verbs\: Get, Find, Look, Identify…  
Summary\: Identify who made this accident happen, by the  
name of the company or the license place, because I want to  
know who did it.  
Finally, I drove home. … I decided I guess there’s nothing I can  
do about this, except chalk it up to one of life’s experiences.  
\(thinking\)  
Verbs\: Drive, Decide, Think, Chalk, Realize, Conclude…  
Summary\: Decide to drive home because there was nothing I  
could do  
# Finding Patterns  
After summarizing all the concepts in all 24 transcripts, the team  
looked for patterns across the summaries. As patterns started to  
form, they found surprises, as well as things they expected. Both  
the surprises and the nonsurprises became extremely useful later  
for reframing their thinking.  
When the team was finished, they went through all the piles a sec-  
ond time to see if they could organize the items into bigger groups.  
Here is a list of all the piles they labeled \(the indented a, b, c level\)  
and the groups they formed based on these piles \(the 1, 2, 3 level\).

# The Mental Model Diagram  
The labels from the piles the team put together are the titles of the  
towers in the mental model diagram. The boxes within each tower  
are the summaries themselves. The affinity groups that formed are  
the mental spaces for the diagram \(Figure 13-10\). Zero In on Current Business Goals  
The team found quite a few patterns in the summaries. Their next  
step was to bring attention to some of the behaviors related to  
priorities articulated in this year’s business goals. These are the  
business goals\:  
•  
Increase membership—attract more insurance customers  
\(a perennial goal\)  
•  
Reduce claims \(a perennial goal\)  
•  
Leverage the company’s social capital \(has been a goal for  
four years\)  
•  
Offer more services via mobile apps, phone or tablet—to  
help people “on the scene” \(has been a goal for the past  
two years\)  
•  
Increase employee pride in what the company does \(new  
this year\)  
With these organization-wide goals in mind, the team went  
through the list of patterns and chose those of most interest. These  
are the patterns that the team thinks might be able to affect some  
of the goals.  
Patterns that Seem Associated with Yearly Goals  
•  
Reassure people I am not hurt  
•  
Confront the person so they won’t do it again to anyone  
else  
•  
Try to defuse the tension between me and the other person  
involved  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Feel upset with myself about my role in the incident \(being  
partially to blame\)  
Feel embarrassed at my reaction, lack of skill  
Spend some time getting the adrenaline out of my system  
Report the incident \(or not\) to authorities so they know  
what happened  
Convince someone in charge to do something to prevent  
this from happening again  
Change my actions so this doesn’t happen again  
Feel compelled to do things I don’t think need to be done  
because of the insurance process  
Prevent an accident by following safe habits  
Figure the accident could have been worse, which qualifies  
it as a near miss  
# CASE STUDY  
# Get Started Inspiring Ideas  
Finally, during some working sessions with key stakeholders, the  
team used these patterns to touch off some ideation. Using the  
actual stories they heard in the listening sessions, the team helped  
the group cycle through extensions that might end in various ways  
for the organization. They guided the working session so that the  
ideas were not limited to an existing product or service.

all those years  
ago  
Praise the  
woman's  
rescue  
directions,  
since she  
sounded  
confident but  
needed to  
know how she  
did  
*Feel relieved the*  
*danger is over*  
Feel relieved I  
didn't have to  
figure out how  
to get his car  
off the highway  
Feel thankful to  
reach the street  
I recognized  
from the last  
meeting I had  
at that building  
Feel safer  
because the  
guy won't try to  
steal my bag  
on these less  
crowded, wider  
sidewalks  
*Feel surprised I*  
*reacted this way*  
Feel surprised  
I’m not taking  
his rage  
personally  
perhaps  
because it was  
luck of the draw  
Feel amazed  
how much the  
shock and daze  
slowed down  
my thinking and  
communication  
s to my wife  
and parents  
Realize my  
message to my  
wife was not  
clear, because  
she knows I  
often work in  
the Tower and I  
might have  
been in it when  
I called, before  
it collapsed  
Feel angry at the other person involved  
# Feel angry at the person who could  
# have avoided causing this  
Feel angry  
while thinking  
of all sorts of  
things to say to  
him about the  
possible  
consequences  
Feel annoyed  
the driver  
forced me out  
of the  
crosswalk,  
even though I  
had the walk  
signal  
Feel angry that  
the big guy with  
the plastic hand  
paddles willfully  
endangered me  
by splitting my  
lane without  
letting me know  
Feel annoyed  
at my team for  
putting me in  
the position of  
making up  
ground with the  
client  
Feel upset that  
their neglect  
has put me out  
in a big way,  
with my car  
undrivable and  
a \$500 repair  
Feel angry at  
the guys for  
accusing me  
when they  
could have said  
something to  
prevent or help  
the situation  
*Confront the other person \(or not\) so he*  
*knows he put me out*  
Make the life  
guards feel  
remorse for not  
paying  
attention  
Try to enlist the  
help of an  
official looking  
car to flag  
down the work  
truck, since  
they may not  
pay attention to  
me  
Struggle to  
decide whether  
I should remain  
my non-  
confrontational  
self, or go up  
there and tell  
him what he  
almost did  
Decide to drive  
home because  
there was  
nothing I could  
do  
Realize that my  
crazy impulse  
to get the driver  
of the official-  
looking car to  
help me pull  
the perpetrator  
over did not  
make sense to  
that person  
Hope I can yell  
at them  
because I need  
to direct my  
aggression at  
someone and  
they should  
know better  
than to leave  
loose bracket  
on top of their  
truck  
Confront the person so he won't do it  
again to anyone else  
Make sure  
someone  
knows the  
rules, if he acts  
in a self-serving  
way  
Remind awful  
drivers that we  
pedestrians  
exist so they  
will driver safer  
Decide it is my  
public service  
to go up there  
and tell the  
young man  
what he did so  
he doesn't do it  
again over the  
next five  
months of  
working here  
Feel angry that  
he is so  
offhanded  
about making  
assumptions  
when he could  
hurt someone  
Try to defuse the  
tension between me  
and the other person  
involved  
Try to try to  
downplay the  
fact that I got  
angry  
Show the  
guards I could  
see their point  
of view, as a  
sort of apology  
Keep the  
situation from  
escalating by  
using a calm  
tone of voice  
and getting out  
of there  
Avoid adding  
tension to the  
situation by not  
accusing him of  
being over the  
yellow line  
Wonder what the other person involved  
was thinking  
Attempt to see  
things from his  
point of view,  
as someone  
who does not  
do flip turns  
Wonder what  
drives the kind  
of anger that  
causes a  
person to strike  
out violently at  
a stranger  
Realize based  
on her story,  
the guard was  
paying  
attention but  
made an  
assumption  
Assume the  
guy who  
jumped in the  
deep end could  
swim, because  
an adult would  
be smarter than  
that  
*Feel upset that the person who did this*  
*probably wasn’t paying attention, doesn't*  
*care*  
Feel astounded  
the life guards  
were chatting,  
not paying  
attention to the  
situation  
Imagine the  
young guy was  
not paying  
attention  
because he  
was listening to  
music as he  
drove his truck  
fast  
Feel frustrated  
that the driver  
and occupants  
of the work  
vehicle appear  
to have no idea  
the damage  
they caused  
me  
Feel upset  
again replaying  
the scenario  
and words in  
my head  
Doubt the guy  
cares about  
what others  
think about his  
lack of safety  
etiquette  
Feel angry  
replaying the  
scenario from  
his eyes and  
seeing myself  
in the middle of  
the lane on my  
back, clearly  
unaware of him  
Feel upset with myself  
# Feel upset with myself about my role in the incident  
# \(being partially to blame\)  
Feel terrified  
that I'd hurt our  
2-year-old  
daughter when  
I fell because  
she was crying  
Feel guilty  
about putting  
my sister  
through all the  
doctor visits  
and hearing  
test  
Feel disgusted  
that I let an  
accident almost  
happen, when I  
know better  
Feel remorseful  
about  
jeapordizing  
both our lives  
with my  
negligent  
driving  
Feel angry at  
myself for not  
recognizing it  
sooner than  
when I see him  
lunge for his  
friend in that  
awful way,  
which means  
he is truly  
drowning  
Feel  
irresponsible  
for not  
watching where  
the pool gets  
deeper,  
because the  
mom had to  
sprint from  
across the deck  
to rescue her  
kid  
Feel upset  
enough to say,  
"Oh sh-t!" when  
I dropped and  
broke all 12  
bottles of Pepsi  
in the garage  
Feel embarrassed at my reaction, lack of  
skill  
Feel  
embarrassed  
about yelling at  
the guard  
Feel  
embarrassed  
that I could not  
control the car  
during the slide  
Feel  
embarrassed  
that my  
husband heard  
me say a swear  
word for the  
first time  
Wonder why I  
swore at such a  
minor thing,  
when I've only  
sworn three  
times in my life  
Feel  
embarrassed to  
immediately flip  
the fancy kayak  
this woman let  
me try out  
Keep driving so  
that if there  
was any cop  
who saw me, I  
would be too  
far gone before  
he could react  
Return home/to what I was  
doing  
Get back home  
Make the car  
safe enough to  
drive home by  
getting the door  
open and  
struggling to  
push the stuff  
down on the  
windshield  
Decide to walk  
to a friend's  
house in New  
Jersey rather  
than take the  
train home  
because the  
transfer station  
is probably  
damaged  
Carry on with what I  
was doing  
Finish what I  
had started,  
even if I'm  
scared  
Feel mad that I  
can't go to the  
gym now  
because I  
slipped on the  
ice and  
sprained my  
wrist  
Review the  
reasons I  
should keep  
riding a bike,  
after nearly  
being hit by a  
car, such as  
dedicated,  
happy, helpful  
fellow  
triathletes

that he had  
stopped and  
we should

Feel frustrated  
that I can't  
cheat the  
medical  
industry and  
just borrow an  
otoscope from  
a doctor I work  
with, because it  
is Sunday  
Feel dismayed  
to find out that  
by filling in a  
field, I have set  
off a long  
process  
involving  
laywers for this  
little accident  
Decide to take  
our daughter to  
the clinic in  
Kroger,  
because it's  
cheaper than  
the emergency  
room copay of  
\$150, which I  
don't want to  
pay  
Struggle to  
decide that the  
responsible  
thing to do is  
pay the  
emergency  
room co-pay,  
rather than wait  
until Monday to  
take her to the  
doctor  
Feel compelle  
to fill in all the  
fields on the  
claim form, to  
tell how I saw  
Feel frustrate  
that we could  
have saved th  
\$150 becaus  
the doctor at  
the emergenc  
room said  
exactly what  
predicted  
Double chec  
with the  
pediatrician o  
call if we real  
need to go to  
the emergenc

nurse said, or  
we can wait a

Case Study\: A Mental Model for a Forward-Thinking Insurance Company﻿ 361CASE STUDY  
Here are a few of the ideas the group came up with, along with  
notes about feasibility and questions to further explore before  
deciding whether to pursue an idea.  
Idea\: Warn Others of This Hazard or Error  
Pattern\: Some customers want to report the incident so that  
authorities know what happened, so they are aware of a  
hazard or the process not working right.  
Idea\: Choose a few details to describe the hazard or error. If  
these details don’t cover it, type in a description. We’ll get  
the information to people who can warn others.  
Goals Met\:  
Reduce future claims\: Getting the message out to the  
channels that customers already use, such as traffic reports  
or Google Maps, will help them become aware of a road  
hazard. They can drive a safer route.  
Build social capital\: If we can get the message out that the  
customers are supplying these valuable hazard reports, and  
we’re getting it to the right people, that would certainly build  
our reputation.  
Increase membership\: Customers will feel satisfaction in  
helping others avoid what they experienced. They may pass  
on the word to others.  
Idea\: Claim-Lite  
362 Chapter 13\: Mental Model Diagrams  
Pattern\: Several of the near misses are minor accidents.  
People are thinking, “It could have been so much worse.”  
The subsequent interaction with the insurance process  
become too entangling when people think of their incident  
as a near miss.  
Idea\: Create a new kind of claim for when the people in-  
volved consider it minor and they don’t want the process to  
become too involved.  
Goals Met\:  
Increase membership\: If it is a positive experience, customers  
will talk about this kind of claim. Once the new process seems  
to be working and stable, we can use it in our marketing.  
Reduce future claims\: This should read “reduce claims,” since  
we’ll replace a certain percentage of claims with the “lite”  
version.  
This insurance company example demonstrates the way  
person-focused research can reframe how an internal group  
approaches improvements to a company’s offerings and in-  
ternal processes. Not every idea should be pursued. The team  
will want to test them. Some of the ideas will be shelved until  
later; others will never see any more attention. It’s even possi-  
ble that none of the ideas make sense for the organization to  
pursue. Try not to become too attached. What’s key is to use  
your empathic understanding of the people an idea supports  
to judge whether to invest more resources in it or let it wither.  
Successful organizations know the difference. About the Contributor

■ Ecosystem models and diagrams  
■ Service, multi-device, and content ecosystem mapping  
■ Case study\: Building a service ecosystem map from the ground up As the internet continues to grow and evolve, service ecosys-  
tems become more complex. Products are connected. The  
idea of a standalone offering is already something of the past.  
Building the proverbial better mousetrap is no longer neces-  
sarily the path to success.  
Instead, thinking in terms of ecosystems is the new competi-  
tive advantage. Steve Denning, a popular business writer with  
Forbes magazine, puts it this way\:  
Even better products can disappear with alarming  
rapidity. By contrast, ecosystems that delight custom-  
ers are difficult to build, but once built, are difficult to  
compete against.\*  
Successful organizations will be determined by how well their  
services fit with one another and, more importantly, how well  
they fit into people’s lives.

CHAPTER 14  
# Ecosystem Models  
Thinking about ecosystems doesn’t apply only to large  
organizations. GOQii, for example, is a small company that  
makes a wearable fitness band. But unlike other brands, theirs  
is connected to a trainer, who provides personalized health  
feedback. Meeting daily goals set by the trainer earns Karma  
points, which users can then donate to good causes.  
By connecting activities around the field of fitness, GOQii  
created an ecosystem of experiences. This is an integral part  
of the GOQii value proposition, reflected in the brand’s  
customer-facing materials, as seen in Figure 14-1.  
Keep in mind that thinking about ecosystems doesn’t mean  
you need to actually create an ecosystem. On the contrary,  
it’s about understanding how your solution fits into a broad-  
er context of service interactions from a human perspective.  
The idea is to consider the experience when moving through  
touchpoints in an ecosystem, even if you don’t control each  
touchpoint.  
This chapter focuses on various types of ecosystem models  
and multichannel maps, pointing out some key techniques  
and uses.

# Ecosystem Maps  
Ecosystem maps tend to favor a network-like arrangement  
of information rather than a chronological timeline, differ-  
entiating them from customer journey maps and experience  
maps, for instance. The general intent is to show relationships  
between multiple entities that comprise an experience. This  
embraces the complexity of modern business offerings and  
how they must be compatible with their surrounding offer-  
ings, including with competitors.  
Ecosystem mapping also provides a view at a higher level  
of granularity than, say, customer journey maps, typically  
zoomed out to include a broad range of factors that may  
only indirectly affect the individual’s experience. As a result,  
ecosystem mapping often precedes other types of mapping,  
368 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models  
which may focus on just one aspect in more detail. Models of  
the ecosystem provide a framework for organizing and inter-  
locking with other types of diagrams.  
Chris Risdon and Patrick Quatelbaum advocate starting with  
a view of the broader ecosystem in their book Orchestrating  
Experiences. The authors write\:  
The basic process includes identifying what makes up  
the ecosystem, identifying the relationships. … An ex-  
perience ecosystem complements other models, such  
as personas and customer journeys, which provide  
insights into your customers and their experiences.  
Figure 14-2 shows an example of an ecosystem map from the  
book. This particular diagram deals with health care in the US,  
showing various entities and their primary relationships with  
one another. The concentric circles reflect immediacy and  
the direct influence of those aspects on the individual, who  
stands in the center.  
The goal is to look at touchpoints and the interactions an  
individual has while moving along the pathways in the system.  
Points of integration between various parts of the model  
emerge, leading to team discussions about opportunities  
and solutions.  
Visualizations offer an immediacy of comprehension and help  
us arrive at strategic conclusions. Maps show interrelationships  
in an ecosystem.  
In biology, an ecosystem is a community of living organisms  
interacting with one another and with nonliving elements in their environment. Think about plants, animals, and insects,  
and how they move in air, in water, and on land. The sum is  
greater than its parts\: ecosystems are diverse sets of rela-  
tionships. We can view organizations and the individuals  
they serve similarly, as a whole rather than a collection of  
­ disparate parts.  
Ecosystem mapping applies what is called systems thinking, or  
a consideration of multiple entities within a complex environ-  
ment in a holistic way. Basically, systems thinking is a way of  
viewing the relationships between multiple components as  
a whole. This allows teams to identify leverage points—or  
points they can influence or impact—to find opportunities for  
change and improvement.  
For instance, based on the model in Figure 14-2 a team might  
discuss the role of health standards in the individual’s overall  
health and how there could be a more direct impact. There’s  
FIGURE 14-2.  
An ecosystem  
map provides a  
high-level view of  
the relationships  
between elements  
in a broader system.  
an intentional oversimplification of each aspect in the diagram  
to be able to focus on the connections between them, rather  
than the complexities within each.  
Cornelius Racheriu, managing partner at the Canadian-based  
consultancy Ampli2de, has also done extensive work with  
ecosystem maps and systems thinking in commercial settings  
and beyond. His approach combines systems thinking with  
design thinking, or creative problem solving.  
Ecosystem diagrams can have a distinct point of view, or a fo-  
cus on one aspect of the system over another. Racheriu points  
to several different perspectives ecosystem maps can take,  
including service ecosystems, device ecosystems, and content  
ecosystems, discussed in the following sections. For additional  
details about Rachieru’s ecosystem mapping process, see the  
case study at the end of this chapter.  
# Service Ecosystems  
Service ecosystem diagrams focus on interactions and touch-  
points within a broad service environment. The aim is to  
understand the goals and needs of individuals in the system  
and how to better provide service to them.  
Figure 14-3 shows an example of an ecosystem map ap-  
pearing in the book Service Design by Andy Polaine, Lavrans  
Løvlie, and Ben Reason. This is a visualization of a car-sharing  
service created for Fiat.  
Each “pie slice” in the diagram represents a different consid-  
eration in the system—in this case, who, what, where, when,  
Ecosystem Maps 369FIGURE 14-3. An ecosystem  
map for car sharing reflects  
interactions at different levels  
of granularity, from the in-car  
experience to cars in the  
community and beyond.  
370 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models why, and how. The concentric circles reflect different levels or  
orders of magnitude of the factors involved.  
The center of the diagram illustrates the relationship of the  
driver to the car. Moving outward, the relationships start  
including passengers, other cars, other services, communities,  
society, and the planet as a whole. Such diagrams allow teams  
to see and discuss the various relationships in a tangible way.  
Kim Erwin, associate professor at the Illinois Institute of Tech-  
nology, Institute of Design, offers an alternative approach. She  
developed an information-dense format called the consumer  
insight map, which she describes as follows\:  
Consumer Insight Maps promote emotional contact  
with research, showcase important complexity in con-  
sumers’ lives and support persistence of the consumer  
voice throughout \(and often beyond\) a design process.  
… Consumer Insight Maps are designed to take the  
complexity of consumers’ lives—the dense, messy,  
interconnected ambitions, activities, anxieties that  
thread throughout their days—and flatten them out  
so that we might examine them more systematically.\*  
Figure 14-4 shows an example of a consumer insight map.  
According to Erwin, the key to their effectiveness is how the  
information is arranged. The technique relies on principles  
from cartographic maps by showing relationships between  
information types.

372 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models For instance, Erwin defines different zones of information,  
seen in Figure 14-5—mindset, activities, anxieties, attitudes,  
and product opportunities. Within each zone, subgroups of  
information provide refinement and depth to the overall story  
told by the map.  
The result is an easy-to-understand overview that exposes the  
diversity of aspects of an experience without an oversimplified  
portrayal. Borrowing from principles of cartography, consum-  
er insight maps present information in context, allowing the  
reader to orient to the territory and consume the information  
at micro and macro levels as desired.  
In another example, the map in Figure 14-6 shows a combi-  
nation of a service ecosystem model at the top in the form  
of a spatial map and a typical customer journey in the lower  
part of the diagram. With this, a team can both discuss the re-  
lationships between different elements in the system and see  
how the experience unfolds over time.  
Overall, service ecosystem mapping is a broad approach with  
few standards or rules to follow. The aim is to provide insight  
into a network of various factors to reduce complexity and to  
make strategic decisions.

Ecosystem Maps 373Device Ecosystems  
These days, it’s common to have interactions with multiple  
devices in our day-to-day lives \(see Figure 14-7\). Two-thirds of  
us shop online across devices, starting on one and finishing  
the transaction on another. Similarly, a banking transaction  
may begin on a mobile phone, move to an ATM, and end on  
a computer. And using a car-sharing service begins by book-  
ing a car \(perhaps on a laptop\), moves to a card reader in the  
vehicle, and ends with an interaction on a mobile phone.  
Though ideally seamless, in reality our experiences are often  
disjointed. People have created hacks, like emailing themselves  
URLs or screenshotting information on one device’s screen  
for use on another. Ultimately, customers lose patience, and  
businesses potentially lose money in the gaps between de-  
vice experiences.  
FIGURE 14-7. The system of connected devices is ever-growing,  
demanding more and more clarity through mapping interactions between  
them.  
374 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models  
The new opportunity is less about designing individual  
touchpoints and more about designing interactions between  
them, whether physical, digital, voice, or otherwise. From this  
standpoint, the product architecture becomes the new user  
experience when interacting with different device touch-  
points fluidly.  
And as the number of devices increases, it becomes more dif-  
ficult to grasp and design coherent experiences. Tearing down  
device silos is a common challenge for any ecosystem ­ designer.  
But there are many factors to balance, and being able to com-  
prehend them at once is imperative. Wolfram Nagel, author  
of the book Multiscreen UX Design, suggests that designers  
focus on four elements\:  
Devices  
A deep understanding of the hardware and its capabilities  
is necessary from the outset.  
Users  
You must also be aware of the users and their goals  
and needs.  
Context  
The environment in which a device is used is critical to the  
design of the system.  
Content  
Information has to be modeled and architected in such  
a way that it can easily traverse different devices and  
screen sizes. FIGURE 14-8. A touchpoint matrix can be used to study the flow of interactions and information across different devices.  
Ecosystem Maps 375To view all of these factors at once, Nagel recommends  
visualizing the interaction in a touchpoint matrix, as shown in  
Figure 14-8. This example shows a day in the life of a perso-  
na, with all of the devices and interactions used. It’s a simple  
but effective approach to see the movement from screen to  
screen and the user requirements necessary at each transition.  
Alternatively, consider how these elements come together in  
Cloudwash, an experimental prototype of a reimagined wash-  
ing machine created by Berg.\* The system integrates a variety  
of services involved in washing clothes, such as contacting a  
plumber, scheduling use of the washing machines, and order-  
ing detergent \(Figure 14-9\). Berg has no direct stake in those  
complementary services, yet the envisioned system combines  
them seamlessly.  
The approach to multi-device design can vary from situation  
to situation. In some cases, the intent may be to provide a  
uniform experience from device to device. In other cases,  
there may be complementary experiences that differ between  
devices. As applications, functions, screen sizes, context, and  
user needs change, so too should your design across devices.  
Michal Levin has done some of the most extensive work  
with multi-device design. In her book Designing Multi-De-  
vice Experiences, she points to three distinct approaches for  
­ creating experiences\:  
Consistent  
In this case, the same basic experience is replicated  
between devices, keeping the content, flow, structure,  
and core features the same as best as possible. Twitter is a  
good example\: layouts may change across different screen  
sizes, but the overall experience is seamless across devices.  
Users can execute a full range of tasks from any device.

\*  
See Bruce Sterling, “‘Cloudwash,’ the BERG Cloud-Connected Washing Ma-  
chine,” Wired \(Feb 2014\).  
376 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models Continuous  
This approach centers on an experience that is passed  
on from one device to another, continuing an activity  
or progressing through a sequence. For instance, using  
Amazon’s Kindle Cloud Reader, customers can stop read-  
ing on one device and continue at the same point they  
left off on another.  
Complementary  
With this approach, devices complement one another,  
with different experiences on each one. The Zipcar app  
is a good example\: while logging into zipcar.com on a  
laptop gives the user access to the full range of account  
and booking options, the mobile app only offers a small  
subset, focused on the driving experience. The options  
are tailored to the device\: there’s even an option to beep  
the car horn from the mobile app to find a parked Zipcar,  
something not available in  
the browser experience.  
There’s an untapped opportunity  
in the gaps between gadgets.  
Multi-device design can unlock  
a lot of potential for customer  
loyalty and business growth. As  
this trend continues, the need  
for visualizing experiences in the form of diagrams will only  
increase, to shine a light on an otherwise invisible aspect  
of design.  
# Content Ecosystems  
Models of an ecosystem can provide the organizational  
underpinnings for information architecture and taxonomy  
development. Specifically, content ecosystem maps focus on  
how information is created and how it flows between end-  
points in a system. That is, they illustrate how information will  
be experienced, both for content creators and consumers.  
For instance, Figures 14-10a through 14-10d show a series  
of diagrams created by Paul Kahn, Julia Moisand Egea, and  
Laurent Kling. These illustrate the ecosystem of content pro-  
duction at the Institut National de Recherche et de Sécurité  
\(INRS\), a large French government organization.  
In Figure 14-10a, each colored carpet represents a different depart-  
ment within the organization, forming a base diagram. Content  
formats and systems are overlaid on the carpets, or colored back-  
ground regions, to provide insight from multiple perspectives.  
# Visualizations offer an immediacy  
# of comprehension and help us  
# arrive at strategic conclusions.  
# Maps show interrelationships  
# in an ecosystem.  
Figures 14-10b to 14-10d then  
show variations of the base  
diagram with additional layers  
and types of information. Figure  
14-10b illustrates the flow of  
content between departments,  
in particular the duplication of  
content from one to another. Fig-  
ure 14-10c uses the same model to look at research activities  
across the organization, using a different color scheme across  
the diagram, and Figure 14-10d shows access to the websites,  
also using a different color scheme.

FIGURE 14-10c. Extending the base map to show various search engines  
and indexes.  
FIGURE 14-10d. This version shows that a portion of the website was  
duplicated to make it available to Google for search indexing. Note also that Figures 14-10a to 14-10d represent a type  
of diagram called an isometric projection. This is a method  
of illustrating three-dimensional objects in two dimensions.  
Isometry is achieved by rotating the angles at which objects  
appear in the diagram. When all line angles are kept the  
same, the sense of a plane is created.  
The point of content ecosystem models is to be able to archi-  
tect information in a way that can be used across mediums.  
The content model defines a pattern for how information in  
an ecosystem will be described and tagged.  
Figure 14-11 shows an example of a content model for attend-  
ing a professional conference, modeled after a diagram created  
by Jonathan Kahn. Each element in the content model can be  
derived from an element in the content ecosystem map.  
Having a diagram of the overall system allows providers to

better understand how concepts and topics relate to one  
another when organizing the content for that system. This  
insight can be used to develop database models, website site

FIGURE 14-11. A content ecosystem is a conceptual model that describes the relationships between the people and things in the information system.  
Ecosystem Maps 379Elements of Ecosystem Models  
Ecosystem maps contrast chronological and hierarchical  
models. Instead of showing a timeline or laddering of ele-  
ments, they reveal relationships in a network-like arrange-  
ment. Insights come from the spatial layout of information,  
for instance by using concentric rings to show priority moving  
inward.  
An ecosystem model aims to provide an overview so the  
system can be viewed as a whole. Taking a step back, view-  
ers can get the big picture quickly, or they can zoom in to a  
section for more detail. Frequently, overlays or variations of  
the diagram provide different snapshots of insight that tell  
multiple stories of value creation.  
Core elements are entities, whether actors, physical objects,  
or content, and the relationships between them. The aim is to  
show the flow of value from one point to another.  
Table 14-1 summarizes the main aspects that define ecosys-  
tem models using the framework outlined in Chapter 2.

This full-length book is dedicated to understanding  
the device ecosystem when designing cross-channel  
experiences. It focuses quite a bit on the mobile expe-  
rience, but not at the expense of other modes, such as  
PCs, TVs, and more.  
Kim Erwin, “Consumer Insight Maps\: The Map as Story Plat-  
form in the Design Process,” Parsons Journal for Information  
Mapping \(Winter 2011\)  
Professor Erwin presents a technique that directly  
draws on the predictable structure of geographic  
maps, called the consumer insight map. This frame-  
work helps teams make sense of experiences in a  
direct and immediate way. She focuses on four aspects  
of cartographic maps to incorporate in visualizations\:  
zones, elevations, topographies, and blueprints. The  
spatial combination of information results in a platform  
for delivering powerful, visual stories that speak to  
diverse stakeholders.

In this pair of articles, design expert Hussain discusses  
approaches to mapping ecosystems. She favors circu-  
lar diagrams that get away from a linear, left-to-right  
depiction of chronology. The focus on behaviors and  
motivations recalls Young’s mental model diagrams.  
Hussain’s maps are very compact and present a clear  
overview at a glance.  
Elements of Ecosystem Models 381CASE STUDY  
# Building a Service Ecosystem Map from the Ground Up  
by Cornelius Rachieru  
Service ecosystem mapping visualizes complex business  
challenges, allowing strategists to find solutions together with  
stakeholders. The approach is domain-agnostic and encourages  
the use of any relevant data lens that can shed light on the  
problem to be solved.  
This process has been successfully used for the past few years  
by my firm, Ampli2de Inc. \(ampli2de.com\), a strategic design  
consultancy in Canada. The method combines techniques from  
both design thinking and systems thinking and integrates  
aspects of previous approaches and readings from Rosalind  
Armson, Peter Checkland, Russell Ackoff, Sofia Hussain, and  
Jim Kalbach.  
Our process reflects a bottom-up approach in two phases, each  
with three steps.  
# Phase 1\: Research and Definition  
We begin with at least two weeks of research into the problem  
space. This includes not only user research but also compet-  
itive research in the industry vertical, along with occasional  
­ market research.  
Next, we start sketching a rich picture of an ecosystem. It’s  
important to keep this low-fidelity as data is collected to allow  
for iterations and adjustments along the way.  
Third, we identify the primary and secondary actors. For the  
purpose of service ecosystem mapping, both human and non-  
human actors are considered. Figure 14-12 shows a sketch of  
these first three steps for an ecosystem map around the topic of  
“retirement.”  
# Phase 2\: Synthesis and Visual  
# Exploration  
In the next phase we apply techniques from systems thinking to  
create a map of the ecosystem. This begins with an underlayer  
of services from the perspective of the primary actor. Borrowing  
from jobs to be done \(JTBD\) practices, we map their objectives  
to each service cluster in the model, as shown in Figure 14-13.  
The JTBD become the main units of analysis in the service  
ecosystem, reflecting what needs are to be supported by the  
provider from the individual’s perspective.  
It’s then possible to expand the area of focus by identifying  
additional clusters. These are considered secondary services,  
but are important to the overall model for comprehending  
the ecosystem holistically. Figure 14-14 shows how we inves-  
tigated further clusters of concern beyond the core model of  
­ primary goals.

FIGURE 14-15. Overlays of strategic factors to consider—or data lenses—provide insight into opportunities and points of intervention.  
386 Chapter 14\: Ecosystem Models Service ecosystems are expansive in scope. The service provider  
must then put boundaries around what to consider for future initia-  
tives. Drawing a line around the service areas in the diagram limits  
the focus of subsequent efforts strategically.  
The last step—and the most important one—consists of choos-  
ing and calibrating various data lenses, or factors that are most  
relevant to the business and the situation. For instance, in the  
example ecosystem map for retirees, we focused on gaps in service  
provision \(shown in red in Figure 14-15\) and cost to acquire the  
service \(in green\). In this case, service providers can then decide  
strategically which gaps to fill based on the cost of delivery.  
The key is to step back and consider a range of areas in the orga-  
nization\: business strategy, enterprise risk management, human re-  
sources, diversity, product, and more. Relying only on familiar data  
lenses may cause you to miss strategic opportunities. Also keep in  
mind that multiple data overlays can be applied, each resulting in a  
unique view into opportunities within the service ecosystem.  
Finally, we end our ecosystem mapping process with a work-  
shop. Armed with a robust ecosystem map that we’re confident  
is grounded in research, the team is able to facilitate a variety  
of conversations to clarify our stakeholders’ strategy. These are  
typically day-long sessions with structured activities that encourage  
discussions and interaction across a diverse stakeholder group.
