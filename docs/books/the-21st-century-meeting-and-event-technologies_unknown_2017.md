This book is dedicated with appreciation and love to my family  
who has been the best supporters from my day one in this world. My  
mother, Young-Ae Kang, and father, Dong-Bok Lee, who was also an  
educator, have supported my education and, most of all, taught me the  
importance of working hard with respect to others. My special heartfelt  
words of thanks to my wife, Young-seon Nam, my daughter, Jiyoon,  
and my son, Brandon, who have been always next to me with warm  
and endless love. In addition, I want to express my sincere apprecia-  
tion to my two academic advisors from my doctoral and master degree  
studies. Dr. Mahmood Khan from Virginia Tech and Dr. Joe Goldblatt,  
who is also co-author of this book, have guided me throughout every  
steps of my academic journey in both sunny days and rainy days. They  
deserve far more credit than I do for the publication of this book. I  
consider myself to be blessed beyond description to dedicate this book  
to all of the above-mentioned people.

George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA  
I want to dedicate this book to my beloved family. They support  
me in the journey and have been there to help me at any time. Warm  
thanks to my husband, Edi, to my son, Andi, to my daughter, Dimana  
and to my mother, Rumi.  
Two more persons have a big impact on my passion for spe-  
cial events and communication. In the year 1998 Professor Vladimir Mihaylov invited me to become part of the Department of Mass Com-  
munication at the New Bulgarian University. He has opened for me the  
door to the great world of teaching, and I am so thankful for this. At the  
beginning of the 21st century when translating from English to Bulgar-  
ian for a book with Dr. Joe Goldblatt, I discovered not only an inspiring  
teacher, but also a great friend. I would not be part of this book if those  
two professors had not crossed my world.  
At the end I want to dedicate this book to all students who will find  
inspiration in it for their future careers.

New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria  
Dr. Seungwon “Shawn” Lee and Dr. Dessislava Boshnakova are not  
only my co-authors, they are also my former students. Therefore, I ded-  
icate this book to the next generation of meeting and event technology  
students who will hopefully emulate the remarkable achievements of  
Seungwon and Dessislava and indeed the thousands of former students  
that I have had the privilege to introduce to the boundless world of  
planned events.  
My first book was written by myself nearly 30 years ago and has  
served as a primer and introductory text for event planning for many  
years. Therefore, I am exceedingly pleased and proud that this book is  
the work of three pairs of hands that include my brilliant students and  
now esteemed colleagues, Seungwon and Dessislava.

Case Studies. ......................................................... 331 Foreword  
These are exciting times. Half the scientists that have ever lived are alive  
today and, thanks to the Internet, they are far better connected than at  
any other time in history. Consequently, we are going through a renais-  
sance of discovery in science, medicine, and technology, which will  
affect all of our lives and transform most industries, including meetings  
and events.  
The rate of technology change is accelerating with thousands of  
ideas, apps, and innovations bubbling up to help meeting planners,  
exhibitors, venues, and other meeting participants to do their jobs bet-  
ter. This digital revolution is profoundly changing events. It is stream-  
lining many logistics tasks, improving collaboration, driving down  
costs, and greatly enriching the attendee experience.  
The challenge for many meeting professionals, however, is how  
does one keep up? This is where The 21st Century Meeting and Event  
Technologies can help. The contents cover a broad range of events tech-  
nology issues with thoughtful insight. This book fills a substantial need  
for meeting professionals to make sense of the rapidly changing pleth-  
ora of choices available.  
Starting with the history of event technology, this important work  
covers the strategic use of technology. It progresses through an analy-  
sis of several technology product categories, It covers many important  
marketing issues and then looks to the future. It is full of case studies,  
additional video content links, and more.  
ix x ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
I heartily commend the efforts of Drs. Lee, Boshnakova, and Gold-  
batt in putting together this important academic work that will be  
highly useful for both students and the meeting professionals wishing  
to advance their career.  
If you are looking for well-rounded coverage of a wide range of  
events technology issues with lots of specific ideas for adoption, selec-  
tion and implementation, I highly recommend this book.

This new and first ever book in the field of meeting and event man-  
agement is emblematic of the rapid changes occurring throughout the  
world with regard to research, communications, planning, coordina-  
tion and evaluative technologies. This book could not have been writ-  
ten twenty years ago because at that time these technologies simply  
did not exist.  
During the past two decades the three authors responsible for  
developing this textbook have had the opportunity to witness from a  
front row seat the sweeping technological changes that have changed  
the meetings and events landscape forevermore. These changes encom-  
pass increased speed in decision making, advanced access to infor-  
mation and data, and the ability to automate many functions within  
meeting and event management that at one time would have required  
substantial human labor.  
WHY WE WROTE THIS BOOK FOR YOU  
Despite the wide differences in age and culture and experience, the  
authors share a strong interest in and commitment to developing  
knowledge about the future of meeting and event technology. The rea-  
son why we have invested nearly two years of our life to research and  
writing this book is actually quite simple. We believe that for you to  
earn your first job and to continually be promoted in the meetings and  
events field, it is essential that you master the fundamentals and as well  
as some advanced skills in technology.  
xi xii ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Only three decades ago technology for meetings and events was the  
equivalent of an electronic typewriter. In the intervening thirty years  
technology has become all pervasive in every function of the meeting  
and event planning job description. Therefore, for you to get in the  
game, stay in the game and grow financially in the future, you must stay  
ahead of the game that is rapidly developing around technology.  
In order for you to be successful in obtaining an entry-level job, you  
will need to master basic technology skills in data entry, research, analy-  
sis, and report writing, as well as be able to enumerate the financial plan  
for your meeting or event through the development and management of  
a budget. In addition to these basic skills, you will need specialized train-  
ing in computer-assisted design and drawing to create floor plans and  
diagrams as well as the ability to develop applications for mobile devices  
that will be used by your attendees to monitor the programs you create.  
Perhaps most importantly, in order for you to progress in your  
career, you will need to be able to use technology to carefully measure  
and evaluate the return on investment \(ROI\), return on marketing  
investment \(ROMI\) and return on objective \(ROO\) for every meet-  
ing and event. Therefore, mastering programs such as SurveyMonkey  
and MeetingMetrics may be in the future just the tip of the iceberg  
of what you will need to know to demonstrate to your superiors that  
your meeting and event is successful and to promote continuous  
improvement.  
While social media is perhaps the most dramatic technological  
change in meeting and event marketing, it is also one of the most diffi-  
cult to measure and evaluate. Therefore, in the future not only will you  
be programming applications that are already commercially available,  
you may indeed be working with future software designers to create  
custom apps for your meeting and event so that you may more care-  
fully measure your outcomes.  
The term ‘event’ is derived from the Latin term ‘e’ meaning out and  
‘venire’ meaning ‘come’. Therefore, every time you create a meeting orPreface ² xiii  
event, you are in fact designing an outcome. Meeting and event tech-  
nology will allow you to better achieve these outcomes with much great  
efficiency, speed, consistent overall quality and improved success for  
your organization.  
STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK  
This book is structured in four parts. Part One explores the traditions  
and upward trajectory of meeting and event technology. The chapters  
in this first part examine how technology has developed and where it  
may be going in terms of future development.  
Chapter 1 examines in detail the 75-year history of meeting and  
event technology and discusses how the tools for research, design, plan-  
ning, coordination and evaluation have dramatically changed through  
miniaturization of design and speed of broadband.  
Chapter 2 discusses how to use the right technology for the right  
purpose. In this chapter you will learn how to conduct internal research  
to see where your technology gaps are within your organization and  
then how to identify the proper technologies to close these gaps in the  
future.  
Chapter 3 explores the concept of search engine optimization  
\(SEO\), which is so important if you want the content about your event  
to be accessible and easy to find online. SEO strategies will help you to  
position your meeting and event at the very top of Google and other  
search engine rankings.  
Chapter 4 discusses the importance of using search engines to con-  
duct your preliminary destination and venue research. In this chapter  
you will learn how to not only search for venues but also how to use  
computer software to design your meeting and event space.  
Part 2 follows on from chapter four by further introducing you to  
practical technological skills in design, planning and evaluation.xiv ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Chapter 5 provides additional techniques for designing and dec-  
orating your meeting and event space to achieve the outcomes you  
desire from your attendees.  
Chapter 6 provides you with the critical tools for developing the  
meeting and event budget and monitoring your performance in real  
time through advanced technological tools.  
Chapter 7 explores the new frontier of virtual events. In this chapter  
you will learn about synchronous as well as asynchronous communica-  
tion and learning opportunities to grow the educational opportunities  
for your stakeholders.  
Chapter 8 describes how technology may be used to create and exe-  
cute a 360 degree evaluation of your meeting and event. It also discusses  
how you may use a mixed evaluation \(pre and post, on site\) to produce  
more high quality information for you for future decision making.  
Part 3 enters the extremely important meeting and event domain of  
marketing. This part demonstrates how you may use the multi-expand-  
ing platforms in social media to increase attendance and engagement  
your meeting and event.  
Chapter 9 demonstrates how to develop, design, and manage wikis,  
websites, audio and video blogs and podcasts to further engage your  
participants before, during and after your meeting or event.  
Chapter 10 provides you with tools and techniques you will need to  
conquer and expand the new frontiers of social media. Not only will you  
learn about the basic social media platforms used in meetings and events  
and business in general, you will also learn how to integrate these mar-  
keting channels to improve the return on your marketing investment.  
Chapter 11 enables you to go mobile with your communications  
through a thorough introduction to numerous new applications and  
the challenges and opportunities you will face in a unplugged meeting  
environment.Preface ² xv  
Chapter 12 focuses on how to encourage, grow, monitor, manage  
and develop user-generated content to promote deeper engagement  
among your participants.  
Chapter 13 carefully and thoughtfully introduces you to registra-  
tion and transaction systems to ensure that you make it easy for your  
participants to join your meeting and event and that you are able in real  
time to monitor your progress.  
Chapter 14 concludes Part 3 with one of the most recent developments  
in meeting and event technology as it explores the many opportunities  
available to you through crowdsourcing potential attendees.  
The final part of the book allows you to pick up the crystal ball  
crafted by the authors to look at the potential future developments in  
meeting and event technology. Part Four also includes over 50 case  
studies from actual meeting and event technology situations and the  
best practices the organizers employed to improve the outcome through  
technological innovation. This final part concludes with a wide range  
of additional resources to assist you in your further study.  
Chapter 15 previews the current and future developments in holo-  
grams, robotics and other technological innovations that may reduce  
the carbon footprint for your event while creating the excitement you  
need to differentiate your program from competitors.  
In some chapters you will find brief anecdotal case studies called  
“Screenshots” to further illustrate the information you are reading.  
These case studies are based upon real-world examples that were part  
of the development of technology for the modern meetings and events  
instrument during the past half century.  
HOW TO BEST USE THIS BOOK  
Each chapter includes carefully selected and prepared endnotes to  
encourage you to discuss, problem solve and direct you to additional  
resources. Make certain you take time to complete the questions andxvi ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
discussion at the end of each chapter and then refer to the additional  
resources you may need for further study.  
The authors have also video-captured interviews of many of the key  
individuals featured in this text. You are strongly encouraged to visit the  
video links available from the publisher \(http\://www.appleacademic-  
press.com/video\_interviews/9781771880237\) to help you better under-  
stand the principles and personalities associated with the individuals  
who are helping lead the development of these new meeting and event  
technologies.  
Finally, Part 4 features numerous case studies and additional  
resources. When you read the case study, pause and reflect before you  
read how the meeting and event organizer used technology to turn a  
challenge into a gainful opportunity. Compare your observations with  
those of others to practice your problem-solving skills. With regard to  
the additional resources, set a schedule to master one new technology  
platform per month. At the end of the year you will be able to add ten  
new skills to your growing resume!  
THE TROUBLE WITH THE FUTURE  
The French poet Paul Valery \(1871–1945\) famously wrote that “The  
trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be.”  
The same is true for meeting and event technology. Whilst research-  
ing and writing this book, several knowledgeable technology experts  
told us that before we entered the words in the computer, the concepts  
would be outdated. We do not agree. In fact, we have found that, in  
fact, the past 75 years of meeting and event technological develop-  
ment have proven that from the manual typewriter to the smartphone  
and even Google Glass and Samsung Smart Watch, the needs of meet-  
ing and event professionals and their participants have remained very  
much the same. The need to conduct research to avoid future error and  
improve performance, the need to communicate, the need to design  
and plan with creativity and precision, and finally and perhaps most  
importantly, the need to measure and evaluate performance are even Preface ² xvii  
more important today than they were nearly one century ago. What has  
changed is the speed and intensity of these increasingly challenging  
demands.  
According to Dan Berger, CEO of the Washington, DC-based event  
technology company Social Tables,  
At its core use case, meeting and event technology eliminates  
inefficiencies, maximizes collaboration, generates actionable  
reports, and engages participants. This, however, is only the tip  
of the iceberg. Advanced meeting and event technology should  
leverage data, identify patterns, and apply thought leadership to  
enhance meetings and events.  
For example, the subject of meeting design and effectiveness  
has been studied for years, and yet planners continue to use inef-  
fective room sets \(e.g. theatre for continuing education sessions  
or traditional U shapes for boardroom style meetings\). This is  
mostly because hotels have always been in control of the diagram  
and—quite frankly–aren’t incentivized to ensure the success of a  
meeting.  
Today’s diagramming solutions \(e.g. Social Tables\) are finally  
liberating the hotel from the responsibility of owning the floor  
plan. They allow planners to create the room set that aligns with  
their meetings’ objectives. But this is only the beginning.  
Smart diagramming solutions have a recommendation engine to  
make intelligent, research-backed meeting design suggestions  
to the planners using them in order to further drive their ROO  
\(return on objectives\).  
Taking this concept one step further, future iterations of such  
software can leverage machine learning to drive meeting effec-  
tiveness by comparing survey results to room setups in order  
to identify the most effective meeting design concepts. \(Don  
Berger, personal communication\) xviii ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
In 2014, Berger’s three-year-old meeting and event technology busi-  
ness received \$8 million in Series A funding to promote further growth.  
When asked what has helped fuel Social Tables’ phenomenal growth,  
he stated that “There are two things I’m very passionate about, and I  
believe they are actually one and the same\: meeting design and mean-  
ingful connections. So many meetings and events are poorly designed  
\(from the content they include to the way they are set-up\), and so many  
people leave these experiences feeling unfulfilled. This is the problem  
we are working on solving at Social Tables.”  
Therefore, we hope that you will use this and other tools to advance  
your career and perhaps even develop tools yourself to improve the  
overall profession of meeting and events in the near future.  
That is why we wrote this book\: Not just for your needs today or  
tomorrow but to provide you with a basic reference that might serve as  
the foundation for your thinking about how to invent the technologies  
that are still unknown but will be needed in the near future. Good luck  
as you re-think and re-invent the future of meetings and events through  
these and many future emerging technologies.

xix About the Authors  
The authors of this book are representative of the changing landscape  
of members of the meetings and events industry. The three authors  
of this book represent three home countries \(South Korea, Bulgaria,  
and the United States\) and have a combined expertise in meetings and  
events of nearly 75 years.  
The lead author, Dr. Seungwon \(Shawn\) Lee, from Fairfax, Virginia  
in the USA, and originally from Seoul, Korea, earned his masters and  
doctorate degrees in the United States. Dr. Lee worked as a computer  
programmer, an association meeting planner, and a director of special  
events for international organizations in Korea and USA before start-  
ing his academic career. He is now an associate professor who leads  
the meetings/events management and technology program at George  
Mason University.  
The second author, Dr. Dessislava \(Dessi\) Boshnakova, from Sofia,  
Bulgaria, is the founder and owner of her PR agency. She is also a  
professor of public relations and events for the first private university  
in Bulgaria, New Bulgarian University. She met the third author when  
she translated one of his textbooks into Bulgarian.  
The third and final author is Professor Joe Goldblatt, from Edinburgh,  
Scotland. Joe is the author, co-author, and editor of 33 books in the  
field of planned events. He recognizes that he is older than the lead  
and second author and, therefore, has less experienced with regard to  
developing technologies because of his late introduction to the Internet.  
xxi xxii ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
While Shawn and Dessi may be digital natives, Joe describes him-  
self as a curious and enthusiastic digital immigrant. The blend of the  
authors’ cultural backgrounds, life experiences, and meeting and event  
technology experience and skill have greatly contributed to the final  
outcome of this book. Introduction  
Welcome to the 21st Century and Beyond\:  
The World of Meeting and Event Technology  
The way people conduct business and communicate in the meeting and  
event industry has drastically changed over the last decade. Meeting  
and event technology used to be elemental to the event management  
and marketing. However, increased use of technology to research,  
plan, market, deliver, and evaluate events is very significant in modern  
meeting and event planning. Modern meeting and event management  
utilizes a model of integrated database systems to simplify and ensure  
greater accuracy for event management and marketing works. That  
SCREENSHOT  
Five steps to acquire and maintain the right technology \(Goldblatt  
2013\)\:  
1\. Identify the technology needs within your organization.  
2\. Review and select appropriate technology.  
3\. Establish a schedule for implementation.  
4\. Provide adequate training for all personnel.  
5\.  Review your needs systematically on a quarterly basis and adapt/  
adopt new technologies as required.  
xxiii xxiv ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
means that event research, development, marketing, coordination and  
evaluation have integrated into one interconnected complex but very  
efficient system to automate and expedite event management activities.  
The meeting and event industry is a global business. According to  
the World Economic Forum \(2008\), it is important for event organiza-  
tions to have core competencies \(it has listed a total of twelve pillars\)  
to effectively compete in the global marketplace. One of the twelve  
pillars of competitiveness within the global economy is “technological  
readiness.” Such effort to lead in technology goes long way back some-  
what sparingly. A concept of “eventology” was first explored 20 years  
earlier by the Institute for Eventology in Japan. It incorporates previous  
studies in sociology, anthropology, psychology, business, communica-  
tions, theology, and “technology.” Goldblatt \(2002\) has developed his  
“four-pillar approach\: foundation for success,” which suggests time,  
finances, human resources, and technology are what one needs to be a  
successful event professional.  
While many technologies become relatively easier to operate,  
understanding the fundamentals of technologies and developing core  
competency in selecting the proper tools for meeting and event man-  
agement is now critical to be a successful modern event planner than  
ever. Today’s and tomorrow’s event planners must remain current with  
all emerging technologies to create greater efficiency and increase over-  
all quality of events.  
TRENDS IN MEETING AND EVENT TECHNOLOGIES  
Fast development of hardware along with affordable prices of tools,  
such as smartphones, tablets, PCs and devices using wireless fidelity  
\(Wi-Fi\) and radio frequency identification \(RFID\) lead the technology  
phenomenon. Wi-Fi is widely used in most tourism and hospitality  
businesses \(hotels, convention centers, restaurants\) as an alternative to  
a wired local area network \(LAN\). Many airports, hotels, and fast-food  
facilities offer free public access to Wi-Fi networks. In addition, tech-  
nological infrastructure, such as fast and secured broadband equipped Introduction ² xxv  
by latest fiber optic cables and hardware, has enabled many applica-  
tions. They include social media, virtual meeting technology, three-di-  
mensional event venue tours, cloud-based event floor design, and  
sharing, and so on. Social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Linke-  
dIn, and Instagram are transforming the way in which event attendees  
communicate before, during and after events and meetings.  
Changing demographics in the event and meeting industry is one of  
key factors that influence future directions of the meeting and event  
industry. It is well recognized that multiple generations are now attend-  
ing meetings and events. They include pre-boomers, baby boomers,  
and Gens X, Y, and Z. Each generation has a very diverse way of  
doing business and communicating. Their wants and needs are also  
very diverse. Therefore, modern event professionals must be flexible  
and accommodate the various types of customers in terms of contents  
and delivery channels in their events. Plus, there is one more growing  
factor—the event and meeting industry is increasingly diverse in cul-  
tural background as meeting and event attendees are coming from all  
around the world.  
The rapid technological development in the field of meetings and  
events will accelerate even more. Technology can create many new  
positions for modern event planners while bringing technological chal-  
lenges to many event professionals at the same time. It is in this realm  
that modern event planners and those who are about to get into the  
field of event management need to improve their technological skills  
along with the fundamental skills of traditional event management.  
Fields related to the meeting and event industry, such as the tourism  
and hospitality industry, have experienced both high-tech and high-  
touch, which will be key to successful meeting and event management.  
This textbook will help both students and entry-level meeting/event  
industry professionals better understand this critical topic\: technology.  
Therefore, this book aims to provide you with the technological tools  
and resources you will need to thrive in the global meetings and events  
marketplace. This book seeks to serve as the first of hopefully many xxvi ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
future volumes to come that will explore and expand the opportunities  
for meeting and event technologists to disseminate new information  
to promote greater access to education and encourage collaboration  
across many markets throughout the world.

“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits, the rebels, and the  
trouble-makers. The round pegs in the square holes.  
The ones who see things differently . . . they change things.  
They push the human race forward.  
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.”

The meetings and events technology field has been painstakingly  
built by technology luminaries such as Reggie Aggarwall, Corbin Ball,  
Michael Boult, John Chang, Bruce Freeman, J’Michelle Keller and edu-  
cators such as Pauline Sheldon, Patti Shock, and many others, whom  
future generations may also refer to as the crazy ones, the misfits, the  
rebels and even the trouble-makers. These individuals and their col-  
leagues used their experiences in many other related fields to bring a  
new industry into being in less than one half of a century.  
According to Professor Robert Rausch, former U.S. Secretary of  
Labor, individuals such as those who worked together bring something  
new into being may be referred to as symbolic analysts.  
“We are living through a transformation that will rearrange the  
politics and economics of the coming century,” says Robert Reich. As  
we move into the borderless economy, the notion of national prod-  
ucts, national technologies, and national corporations will become  
increasingly meaningless. The only thing that will remain rooted  
within national borders are the people who make up a nation. This  
shift has enormous political implications, according to Reich. It  
means that the traditional idea of national solidarity and purpose  
can no longer be defined in purely economic terms. It also leads to  
fragmentation, Reich argues, as “those citizens best positioned to  
thrive in the world market are tempted to slip the bonds of nationalThe History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 5  
allegiance, and by so doing disengage themselves from their less  
favored fellows.” \(Rausch,1992\)  
Traditionally, meetings, events and universities have been referred  
to as marketplaces of ideas. The marketplace was historically a geo-  
graphically fixed place. This is no longer true. These marketplaces do  
not manufacture traditional goods and products in one place; rather  
they create information, provide education and transform thinking  
through collaboration in many different places. In order for these  
global market places to continue to thrive in the future, a new gener-  
ation of meeting and event technologists is needed who understand  
the fluent nature of events and will be better prepared to design the  
applications and software that will promote even greater collaboration  
in the future.  
In little more than half of a century, just about the length of Steve Jobs’  
life, the meetings and events industry has experienced dramatic change.  
Table 1.1 provides a brief example of some of these significant changes.  
Harry Baum of Great Britain, is a long-time leader in the inter-  
national meetings, incentives, conventions and exposition industry.

\(Goldblatt, 2014\) 6 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
In the mid 1990s, Harry gave a lecture one evening at the George  
Washington University in Washington, DC, for a group of sleepy-  
eyed graduate students. Many of these students had just completed  
a ten-hour working day and now were in a dark and dusty graduate  
lecture hall to listen to their guest speaker from England.  
Baum began his talk by slowly and carefully announcing in a  
deep, sotto British voice, “The modern meetings industry was created  
through warfare.” With those profound and intriguing words his audi-  
ence was soon fully awake and most attentive. Baum explained that  
most of the computers and aviation innovations used in the modern  
meetings and events industry that were developed in the previous fifty  
years were the result of technologies developed for advancing warfare  
in World War II.  
For example, Baum related the development of international airline  
travel to the need to develop airplanes for long haul troop transporta-  
tion during World War Two. Further, he stated that electronic comput-  
ing was developed and subsequently used to fire artillery. According to  
Baum, the development of the modern global meetings industry was  
directly related to the development of solutions for creating weapons  
and strategies for effective warfare.  
There may indeed be a technological connection between meet-  
ings, events and warfare, and the strange and winding story stretches  
as far back as the mid-nineteenth century in Scotland. In this chapter  
we will explore the relatively brief but fascinating traditions and history  
of technology and will look forward to the future trajectory current and  
still undeveloped discoveries that may chart the twenty-first century  
meetings and events industry.  
From Analog to Digital\: How War Helped Invent  
Modern Technology for Meetings and Events  
It is commonly believed that actual research on finding solutions to  
equations using mechanical devices started as early as 1836 with aThe History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 7  
mechanical analog computer called the “differential analyzer.” This  
wheel and disk system may have been one of the first computing  
devices.  
The first description of this device is from James Thomson in 1876.  
Thomson was from Belfast, Ireland, but lived in Scotland from the  
age of 10. He called his device the “integrating machine,” and with his  
brother, the famous Lord Kelvin, he published additional descriptions  
of this early computer. Lord Kelvin later became a renowned mathe-  
matical physicist and engineer.  
Lord Kelvin recommended that the integrating machine be first  
used for fire control. Various other scientists were also developing  
integrating machine technology at this time; however, the first widely  
practical differential analyzer was constructed by Harold Lock and  
Vannevar Bush in the United States at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology \(MIT\) between 1928–1031. The number of integrators  
used in these machines continued to grow, and scientists in Norway  
developed a system with 12 integrators in 1938. Only a few years later,  
once again in the United States, researchers would exceed this func-  
tionality through the development of the world’s first programmable  
computer.  
ENIAC\: The U.S. Army and the Age of Modern  
Computing  
During the 1940s researchers Mauchly and Eckert lead a team at the  
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia to develop a programma-  
ble computer that would calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S.  
Army. In 1946 they announced the development of the first Electronic  
Numerator Integrator and Computer, or more commonly known as  
ENIAC.  
If you were to enter a room to inspect the ENIAC, you would find  
huge cabinets containing 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes,  
1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, and around 5 million8 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
hand-soldered joints. The ENIAC unit weighed more than 30 tons and  
was over 100 feet in length and required a room of 1800 square feet.  
The ENIAC computer was programmable, and this was accom-  
plished using punch cards and tape punched with holes. One of the  
first major tasks required over 1 million punch cards, and the ENIAC  
was involved in the development of the hydrogen bomb in Los Alamos,  
New Mexico.  
SCREENSHOT  
Early Meetings and Events Computer Technology  
Although most students today have been using computers since early  
childhood, the baby boomers \(today’s students’ parents\) may only  
have been exposed to computers in their early thirties. Some grad-  
uated from a manual and later electric typewriter to a simple com-  
puter manufactured by firms such as Tandy™ which was a brand of  
the large technology retailer named Radio Shack. Tandy was one  
of the first companies along with Commodore and Apple to launch  
the personal computer revolution. In 1976, my first computer was a  
Tandy 1000. It was a competitor of the IBM personal computer but  
was more affordable for small and medium enterprise business use.  
My small events company needed an automated system to maintain  
a database of suppliers, create and store contracts, and perform sim-  
ple mathematical computations. The Tandy 1000 solved many of our  
business problems. However, the on-screen and printed typeface was  
somewhat fuzzy, it required the use of large stacked sheets of paper  
with perforated holes on each side \(that frequently jammed in the  
printer\), and it took up significant space in our small office. For many,  
including our small events firm, it would be our first encounter with a  
personal computer as an essential business tool. Little did we know  
that this was only the beginning of what would continue today to be  
a rapidly expanding presence for technology in the meetings and  
events industry. The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 9  
Given the early involvement of the U.S. military in the development  
of programmable computers, it is now easy to understand why Harry  
Baum remarked that the history of the global meetings and events  
industry is also the history of modern warfare.  
Between the 1940s and the dawn of the twenty-first century com-  
puter technology changed dramatically in two dimensions. First, the  
component parts of computer technology became significantly smaller  
with the full capacity of the ENIAC system, reduced by 1995 to a silicon  
chip measuring 7.44 mm by 5.29 mm. This 20 mega-hertz chip was also  
20 times faster than the now ancient ENIAC.  
Between the 1930s and the final decade of the twentieth century  
computers became smaller, faster and had much greater capacity  
for complex computational functions. While the U.S. military may  
have been the birth mothers and fathers in the development and use  
of complex computer systems, global business, including meetings  
and events, became the experienced parents who would set the stan-  
dards for future productivity through an increased reliance upon  
technology.  
The Real Technology Wars\: Hewlett Packard,  
IBM™ and Apple ™  
The Macro Technology Environment  
After approaching Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, for  
a job in 1968, Steve Jobs incorporated Apple computers only eight years  
later. Jobs and his partner Steve Wozniak \(Woz\) developed and marketed  
their personal computing products Apple I, II and III and Lisa widely.  
In 1979, Jobs discovered the graphical interface technology developed  
by Xerox in their laboratories in Palo Alto, California, and adopted this  
system to dramatically expand the functionality of Apple products.  
Just after Apple became a publicly traded corporation in 1981,  
IBM launched their first personal computer and simultaneously10 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
seriously threatened Apple sales. In 1983, Time Magazine selected  
the computer as its machine of the year, much to the disappointment  
of Steve Jobs who had lobbied and hoped for this honor. During this  
same period of time, thanks in part to the rapid development of per-  
sonal computers and the competition between the major manufac-  
turers, the meetings and events industry rapidly adopted computer  
technology for basic tasks including word processing, registration,  
finance and accounting and computer-assisted design and drawing  
to create diagrams and room set-ups.  
The invention of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in  
the early 1990s enabled the rapid expansion of communications in the  
modern meetings and events industry. In 2012 Tim Berners Lee par-  
ticipated in the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony and  
tweeted “This is for everyone,” which was simultaneously projected on  
the backs of 80,000 stadium seats \(Friar, 2012\).  
In 1993 America Online \(AOL\) and CompuServe combined opera-  
tions to create a global standard for Internet e-mail service. In the mid-  
1990s the search engine and social media site that would later become  
Yahoo was established by two Stanford University Students as “Jerry’s  
Guide to the World Wide Web” \(Clark, 2008\).  
The first weblog was posted by Justin Hall in 1994 and now has  
resulted in, according to Technorati, 60 million blogs with many tar-  
geting the meetings and events industry.  
By the turn of the twentieth century, many technology pundits had  
predicted the worldwide collapse of computer systems due to Y2K \(the  
predicted inability of computers to cope with change in clocks as the end  
of the millennium\). There was, however, little to no disruption reported.  
In 2003, Intel Corporation first included Wi-Fi in its Centrino  
chip, and this greatly accelerated the mobility in computer networking.  
Wi-Fi would soon be incorporated in the design of most hotels, air-  
ports and convention centers.The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 11  
The phrase Web 2.0 was coined in 2004 by O’Reilly Media to define  
the rapidly developing interactivity opportunities that were now pres-  
ent within the World Wide Web.  
Despite a period of strong economic productivity in the meetings  
and event sector, a series of dramatic setbacks were looming large on  
the horizon.  
First, in 2008, the financial collapse of the investment banking firm  
Lehman Brothers created a domino effect throughout the global finan-  
cial markets, and soon many of the world financial centers including  
the United States, Great Britain and others were plunged into a wide-  
spread economic recession.  
In 2009 the huge multinational insurance and financial services  
firm, AIG, hosted a lavish party while using US government TARP  
\(Troubled Asset Relief Program\) funds. The widespread publicity that  
resulted from this event led to the US government and others chastis-  
ing the meetings and events industry for irresponsible spending. Even  
President Obama stated that government meetings should not be held  
in Las Vegas and, this resulted in an immediate reduction in revenue  
for this destination. The term “AIG Effect” was coined to describe the  
new scrutiny meetings and events were receiving by government and  
other key stakeholders.  
However, once again the industry was able to recover by incorpo-  
rating more technology to compensate for the lack of ability to travel  
as in times past. Lee and Goldblatt \(2012\) conducted a study in 2010  
of nearly 400 festival event managers, and their findings determined  
that many event professionals were now turning to social media and  
websites to replace and lower their advertising costs.  
Although the use of holography had first been introduced by Gabor  
in 1972, it was used for the first time nationally in the presidential elec-  
tion of 2008 as broadcast by CNN. The host, Wolf Blitzer, conducted  
a life-like television interview with a hologram of the reporter Jessica12 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Yellen, and it was seen by millions of viewers throughout the world.  
In 2012 the Coachella Music Festival in California introduced a holo-  
gram of the late Tupac Shapur who performed a duet with the very live  
Snoop Dog before over 100,000 people. According to hologram indus-  
try experts, this technology had finally reached its zenith during this  
astonishingly real performance.  
Despite the promise of increasing global technologies, the discov-  
ery of high security data being leaked by reporters and whistle blowers  
Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, and Edward Snowden revealed the  
further potential for disruption through the expanding accessibility of  
technology.  
The technological developments by the entertainment industry con-  
tinue to lead the way through film, television, and Internet. One of the  
latest developments by the Walt Disney Company is titled 3Disney and  
provides the ability not only to touch but also FEEL in three dimensions  
as the user touches a textured computer screen. This is accomplished  
by the process called “tactile rendering of 3D features.” According to  
The Washington Post in 2013, engineers at Disney Research developed  
a rendering algorithm that uses small electronic pulses to trick your  
fingers into feeling bumps and texture—even though the surface is flat  
\(Dewey, 2013\).  
Developments in Meetings and Event Technology  
During this same period of global advancement in technology, the  
Braehler company of Germany introduced in 1961 the first single line  
system for conference communications. Prior to this revolutionary  
invention dozens of cables needed to be used for conference delegates  
to communicate with one another. Later, in 1976, Braehler used their  
rapidly development technologies for 300 delegates to simultaneously  
communicate at a meeting of the United Nations.  
As Apple was introducing the first Mac computer in 1984, Brae-  
hler simultaneously introduced European conference delegates to itsThe History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 13  
DIGIVOTE system. The DIGIVOTE system enabled conference dele-  
gates to vote on proposals and candidates from their seating location  
in the congress center.  
A few years later, the trade association Meeting Professionals Inter-  
national \(MPI\), founded in 1972, introduced just fifteen years later its  
first Computer Special Interest Group. This group enabled meeting and  
event professionals to communicate about issues of common concern  
regarding meeting and event technology. During this same period the  
first computer-generated name badges made their first appearance and  
plastic lead retrieval cards were used by trade show exhibitors to track  
buyer relationships.  
In 1988, the hospitality industry recognized they needed a  
common technology platform, and they developed The Hospital-  
ity Industry Switch Company \(THISCO\). Later THISCO would  
become Pegasus and result in processing upwards of 300 million  
transactions each month. The first 1D barcode was also introduced  
at this time and further advanced the lead generation system for  
trade shows.  
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, meeting and event technology  
firms such as PC Nametag and Lasers Edge developed software for  
printing name badges for delegates. In the early 1990s as the first lap-  
top computers began to appear, a new technology entrant, PlanSoft,  
introduced a web-based tool to standardize meeting and event com-  
munications. Due in large part to the rapid development of technology,  
MPI established the first online discussion group for meeting and event  
technology professionals, called MPINet.  
In the mid-1990s the travel company McGettigan created a web-in-  
terfaced software product called Real-Planner. By the end of that decade  
this product would be further redeveloped and renamed StarCite.  
In a unique partnership with MPI and the American Society  
of Association of Executives \(ASAE\) PlanSoft began work in 199514 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
on the first comprehensive searchable facilities database. The final  
product was finally launched in 1997. During this same period the  
Holiday Inn Corporation developed and launched the first online  
system for purchasing hotel rooms. Simultaneously, San Francisco’s  
Miyako Hotel developed the first online request-for-proposal sys-  
tem in collaboration with Cardinal Communications, and in 1996  
Motley and Layton founded Pass-Key, the first online group reser-  
vations system.  
By the end of the 1990s EventSource and StarCite were providing  
the first online auctions for sale of meeting space. The HotRatesHot-  
Dates website was the first to offer for sale distressed last-minute hotel  
inventory to planners in 1999,while seeUthere.com and Eventbrite.  
com launched the first commercial and consumer meeting and event  
reservations sites.  
By the start of the twenty-first century there were only a few appli-  
cation service providers \(ASP\); however, they grew in number expo-  
nentially during the dawn of this era. As a result of this exponential  
growth in technology, the first online trade show, ExpoExchange, was  
conducted in 2000. Delegate networking experienced a huge improve-  
ment with the development of ShockFish, which allowed individuals to  
see pictures and details of other delegates within 20 feet of where they  
were standing. GetThereDirect launched the first group space reserva-  
tions tool, and this led to Google and Hotel Planner creating the first  
small group reservations tools in 2003.  
The meetings and events industry was also realizing the need for  
standardization of processes due to the rapid developments in tech-  
nology. The Convention Industry Council \(CIC\) \(originally named the  
Convention Liaison Council\) was founded in 1949 as super association  
\(similar to the United Nations\) to represent the interests of associations  
within the meetings and events industry. It subsequently grew to repre-  
sent over 30 different meeting and events industry associations whose  
combined membership was over 100,000 people.The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 15  
In 2000 the U.S.-based Convention Industry Council established a  
committee to develop accepted practices for the meetings and events  
industry. This committee developed the Accepted Practices Exchange  
\(APEX\), which has been responsible for developing standardized forms  
and most recently standard reporting practices.  
In many ways the turn of the millennium was a major turning point  
for the development of meeting and event technology. On September  
11, 2001, acts of major terrorism occurred in the United States, result-  
ing in the immediate disruption of many businesses, including the  
meetings and convention industry. Thanks in large part to technologi-  
cal advancements of the recent past, the industry was able to commu-  
nicate and recover its operations.  
Despite the disruptions of 2001, the meeting and event technol-  
ogy industry continued to grow and improve rapidly. E-mmediate was  
introduced by Hyatt Hotels Corporation in 2002 as an online booking  
tool for small meetings. The web-based meeting and event network-  
ing tools powered by Rio and IntroNetworks were introduced to help  
people of similar interests connect. Mobile weblogs \(McLogs\) were  
introduced during this same time period to rapidly accelerate real-  
time communications during conferences and exhibitions. At the same  
time, StarCite and Outtask, Inc. introduced the first real-time airline  
booking product.  
By the early to mid-2000s, new tools were entering the meeting and  
event technology marketplace. Radio Frequency Identification \(RFID\)  
name badges were introduced in 2003 to enable the specific movement  
of delegates to be tracked by planners.  
The Convention Industry Council’s \(CIC\) Accepted Practices  
Exchange \(APEX\), the initiative having been first established three  
years earlier, delivered its first product, the APEX online glossary of  
terms, edited by Professor Patti Shock of the University of Nevada at  
Las Vegas.16 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
By 2004, the Hilton Hotels Corporation reported that online book-  
ings for the first time exceeded the reservations received by telephone  
call centers. This period was also a time of acquisition and merger  
for the meetings and events technology industry, with PlanSoft and  
seeUthere merging in 2004 to form OnVantage.  
The CIC APEX released its first technology and standardized form  
product through Toolbox 1.0 in 2005. American Express and Travent  
Ltd. along with OnVantage cooperated to make tracking of corporate  
travel much easier and more accurate with the development of the first  
corporate procurement card.  
Two of the oldest meeting and event planning software firms, Peo-  
pleWare and Amlink, joined the long list of acquisitions and mergers.  
The following year, two largest meeting and event technology firms,  
OnVantage and StarCite, finally merged. At the time of the merger,  
Corbin Ball, an industry expert, described this as the meetings and  
events technology equivalent to Microsoft and Apple merging.  
The CIC APEX project developed the XML data map in 2006 to  
move toward the development of an electronic data exchange that  
would for the first time allow the establishment of true data standards  
for the meetings and events industry.  
The Braehler company once again demonstrated its market lead-  
ership through the creation and launch of the first wireless conference  
system that eliminated the need for even a single line as they estab-  
lished in 1961.  
Established meeting and event technology firms such as Cvent,  
MeetingMatrix, and others continued to grow in mid- to late-2000,  
with Cvent raising nearly \$118 million dollars through its first public  
offering. MeetingMatrix was sold for an undisclosed sum to hospitality  
industry technology market leader Newmarket International Inc.

WHAT IS NEXT?  
According to the leading journalists reporting on trends in the meet-  
ings and events industry, we are experiencing the tip of a very deep ice-  
berg in terms of future developments in this rapidly evolving industry.  
Barbara Palmer and Michelle Russell are experienced trade journal-  
ists with a combined 50-plus years of experience. Russell is the editor-  
in-chief of one of the meeting and event industry’s most recognized  
publications, Convene magazine, which is published monthly by the  
Professional Convention Management Association \(PCMA\). Accord-  
ing to Palmer and Russell\:  
We need to develop the ability to collect implicit data about our  
attendees. People read and share differently. Perhaps the further  
use of RFID badges to create a heat map using Google and, the  
ability to observe human behavior during meetings and events will18 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
be increasingly important. Also the ability to instantly conduct  
data through polls and surveys will also be important. The link to  
education is finding and developing systems to best use your time  
for what suits your educational needs the best. Perhaps the fur-  
ther development of language translations systems will be dramat-  
ically improved allowing for instantaneous communication during  
meetings and events. \(Palmer and Russell, 2014\)  
Betsy Bair is the experienced content director of a group of meet-  
ings and events magazines published under the banner of Meetings-  
Net. Her magazines include specialist content for medical, insurance,  
religious and other types of meetings. Bair states that\:  
One important innovation would be a surveying application to  
enable you to instantaneously capture other people’s responses  
to speakers and content. At the 2014 PCMA conference they  
have invited three students from MIT and three from Harvard  
to observe the conference and make recommendations regarding  
the future architecture of this conference. Who knows what bril-  
liant ideas they may come up with that will improve the experi-  
ence of all participants, both face to face as well as virtual. \(Bair,  
2014\)  
These three experienced journalists all agree that while it is difficult  
to predict the future of technology for meetings and events, the devel-  
opments will be rapid and will profoundly influence the way planners  
and their participants engage with content and experience their future  
meetings and events.  
There is a sign over the door of the United States Archives that  
states “Where Past is Prologue.” If the past is our prologue to the future,  
then one common function of all meeting and event technological  
innovations appears to be the role of communications. Following the  
development of the printing press and later the Internet, the most pro-  
found development in twenty-first century technology is the mobile  
telephone.The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 19  
THE 10-YEAR REVOLUTION OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY  
It may be hard to believe that the first Apple iPhone only became com-  
mercially available less than a decade ago in 2007. However, one of its  
many predecessors, beginning in 1973 was the Motorola model that  
was the size of a shoebox. Later in 1993, the Bell South IBM Simon  
model was developed, and this was followed very quickly in 1996 by  
the Nokia Communicator and in 1997 by the Ericsson GS88, which  
first coined the term “smartphone.” The Ericsson revolution continued  
in 2000 with the first touch screen and was followed by the develop-  
ment of the Palm mobile phone series \(Palm, Palm Treo, Palm One\),  
the first to include a full operational keyboard and to become widely  
used. Microsoft soon entered the mobile technology race with the Mic-  
rosoft Pocket, which was the first to use the Windows operating system  
in mobile technology. In 2002, RIM introduced the Blackberry, which  
was the first mobile device to allow wireless e-mail capability. In 2007  
the iPhone became the first to offer multi-touch interface technology  
through a highly interactive touch screen. Finally, in 2008, the develop-  
ment and launch of Android system would further accelerate the use of  
smart mobile telephones throughout the world, with HTC creating the  
first Android mobile phone.  
As a result of these technological developments, mobile phone  
usage worldwide rose rapidly. For example, between 1990 and 2011  
global mobile phone subscriptions increased from 12 million to over  
6 billion. Today’s modern meeting and event professional relies on the  
smartphone to communicate, enumerate, and evaluate a wide range of  
tasks. Many meeting and event professionals consider the smartphone  
an essential tool for their business use.  
The rapid rise of personal computers and mobile technologies has  
enabled meeting and event professionals to not only work smarter  
but in some cases also work faster. As computer technology rapidly  
developed between the 1940s and 1990s, according to McGrattan  
and Rogerson drawing on U.S. census data, the number of working  
hours of U.S. workers actually decreased from 41 to 37 hours per20 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
week. However, other statisticians contest their analysis and actually  
state that women were working 300 hours per year more than their  
male counterparts who were estimated to be working an additional  
SCREENSHOT  
Early Mobile Communications  
A meeting and event company invested in the later 1970s in a device  
known as a digital pager. This device sent a text message to a box about  
the size of a pack of cigarettes. The message was usually a telephone  
number that would need to be called to retrieve a message. Within a few  
years the digital capacity of pagers grew and more detailed messages  
could be sent. By the early 1980s we invested in a mobile telephone.  
The unit was the size of a shoebox, and the one installed in my auto-  
mobile filled the trunk of the car and required a large exterior antenna  
affixed to the vehicle. It also required placing the telephone call through  
a central operator. By the start of the twenty-first century the pager had  
disappeared and been replaced, thankfully, by the multi-functional and  
much smaller mobile phone. This allowed meeting and event planners  
to truly become less reliant on their physical office premises for com-  
munications. Throughout each of these technological changes, meeting  
and event planners have been able to improve their level and quality of  
customer service as well as increase revenue through more rapid com-  
munications. As a result of these developments local, state, and federal  
laws have been enacted, for good reason, regarding the use of mobile  
devices while driving motor vehicles. I recall once receiving a mobile  
telephone call from a large client while driving on a major highway. The  
client agreed to approve my \$500,000 proposal. I was momentarily  
dazed by this announcement and almost caused an accident. Accord-  
ing to the U.S. National Highway Safety Administration, about 6000  
deaths and half a million injuries are caused by distracted drivers each  
year. In 2011, it was estimated that 900 deaths may have been directly  
caused by mobile phone usage while driving; however, this number  
could be much higher \(National Highways Traffic Safety Administra-  
tion, 2013\). The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 21  
100 hours. Technology, during the past half century, has either given  
us an opportunity to work more efficiently and perhaps increase our  
leisure time or to as shown by the example above concerning using  
the mobile phone while driving, simply work all the time due to the  
utility of evolving technologies.  
THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET  
During the opening ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympic Games,  
the scientist Tim Berners-Lee was saluted for having helped invent the  
World Wide Web and then giving it away freely for the world’s benefit.  
The history of the Internet actually began with the introduction of elec-  
tronic computers in the 1950s.  
ARPANET was the first Internet network at the University of Cali-  
fornia, Los Angeles \(UCLA\), and the first message was sent from Pro-  
fessor Leonard Kleinrock’s laboratory. Later in the 1960s and 1970s,  
this packet-switched network introduced the development of Internet  
protocols for linking multiple networks.  
The U.S. National Science Foundation \(NSF\) provided greater  
access in 1981 to ARPANET through the introduction of the Com-  
puter Science Network \(CSNET\). By 1982 the full Internet protocol  
suite known as TCP/IP was fully functional, and the introduction of  
the worldwide Internet was complete.  
The 1990s provided revolutionary change in communications  
technologies through the Internet introduction of e-mail, instant mes-  
saging, voice over Internet protocols \(VoIP\), two-way Internet video,  
weblogs, social media, online shopping, and of course, the World Wide  
Web in 1989.  
Figure 1.2 depicts Internet penetration worldwide in 2012 and also  
reveals the digital divide that still exists between the developing and the  
developed worlds.22 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

SCREENSHOT  
Early Internet Technology  
CompuServe was the first major commercial Internet service provider  
\(ISP\) in the United States. It was the leading provider of Internet ser-  
vices in a not very crowded field throughout the 1980s. However, a  
new start-up called America On Line \(AOL\) disrupted its dominance  
through the introduction of new fixed rate monthly fees instead of the  
CompuServe hourly charges. I used CompuServe for my personal  
home computing at that time. A small electronic modem connected the  
computer to a telephone line in order to access the Internet. When the  
modem was connected it was not possible to make a traditional tele-  
phone call unless the line was dedicated for the Internet.  
One late evening I noticed a string of white text slowly creeping across  
the black screen. The message stated\: “This is Miss Ying in Beijing.  
How are you?” I stared intently at the screen and then ran to my wife  
and said, “China is calling!” My excitement reminded me of the first The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 23  
time Alexander Graham Bell placed the first telephone call or Thomas  
Alva Edison illuminated the first light bulb.  
Although the dial-up modem was a slow connection, nonetheless,  
it was an exciting time where, not unlike the invention of the print-  
ing press and later the telegraph, one could expand the footprint of  
global communications with a few key strokes.  
The Internet was in some ways a direct descendant of the digital  
technology developed in the nineteenth century through the invention  
of the telegraph. The telegraph was first used as early as 1809 in Bavaria,  
but the most successful and universally accepted form was demonstrated  
by the American and New York University Professor Samuel Morse in  
1838\. Morse demonstrated his ability to send messages using “Morse  
Code” over a telegraph wire, but it took the U.S. Congress another five  
years to find a telegraph wire between Washington, DC, and Baltimore,  
Maryland \(about 40 miles distance\). Six years later Morse used his  
device to send the announcement of the political party nominee from  
midway between Baltimore and Washington, and the message was tele-  
graphed to the U.S. Capitol. In a later message from the U.S. Supreme  
Court, Morse used his code to ask, “What hath God Wrought?” The  
technology pioneers from the United States and the United Kingdom  
who developed Internet protocols with universal standards and later  
the World Wide Web perhaps did not anticipate the rapid change these  
innovative technologies would bring to global society.  
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEARCH ENGINES\: CANADA,  
USA AND SWITZERLAND  
The first tool used for web searching was called Archie, a name that  
represents archive without the v. It was invented in 1990 by computer  
science students at McGill University in Canada. Archie downloaded  
public file transfer protocol \(FTP\) data but it did not have the ability to  
index this data.24 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
In 1991 at the University of Minnesota, Gopher was created, which  
led to additional search engines called Veronica and Jughead \(additional  
characters in the Archie comic book series\). The major advantage of  
Veronica is that is allowed the use of keyword searching for the first time.  
By the summer of 1993, Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of  
Geneva, Switzerland, created an Internet script called PERL, which led  
to the development of the world’s first primitive search engine in the  
autumn of the same year. Simultaneously, the world’s first web robot  
was being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
\(MIT\) in Boston, and this tool was used to generate a web-based index  
of data that could be retrieved.  
In 1994 the first all-text crawler-based search engine called Web-  
Crawler was developed and was soon followed by the first commercial  
search engine service, called Lycos. Within the following two to three  
years search engine names that are familiar today were first introduced.  
These included Yahoo, which became one of the most popular search  
engines as users could browse its entire directory as well as use its key-  
word search function.  
Netscape selected five search engines, Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Info-  
seek, and Excite, to operate in rotation on its web browser commencing  
in 1996. However, the major entrant was soon to arrive and further dis-  
rupt and expand the functionality of search engine technology.  
Google arrived in the early days of the twenty-first century, and its  
major contribution was the incorporation of an algorithm that allowed  
page rankings \(PageRank\). Google also featured a simple minimalist  
search page design that made it very popular with web users.  
The primary competitor at that time was a Microsoft search engine  
product first called MSN Search in the late 1990s and then rebranded in  
2009 as BING. MSN Search first used AltaVista as its search engine and  
then later in 2009, through BING, agreed that Yahoo! Search would be  
powered by Microsoft BING technology.The History of Meeting and Event Technology ² 25

SCREENSHOT  
The Early Search Engines\: The Library Card Catalogue  
The Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford in the United King-  
dom is one of Europe’s oldest libraries. A researcher visited the  
Bodleian to research early graduation ceremonies at the University of  
Oxford. The octogenarian library research assistant suggested they  
first search the card catalogue. The card catalogue was a filing sys-  
tem developed in the late-nineteenth century to contain all of the bib-  
liographic records in the modern library. When using this tool, one  
would manually search thousands of cards filed by the name of the  
author, title of the record, the subject, and the category.  
The research assistant squinted at the handwritten records reaching  
back to over 150 years of graduation ceremony records. Finally, in  
exasperation he turned to the visiting as said, “Let’s just Google it.”  
The pair adjourned to the research assistant’s office and, in a few sec-  
onds, found all of the records needed using the Google Drive search  
engine technology. As the research assistant led the visiting researcher  
to the actual bibliographic materials needed for his research, he mur-  
mured, “These tired ancient eyes really appreciate the Google search  
engine. The type is brighter, larger and it is easier to access than the  
card catalogue. Who would have imagined?”  
In just a few minutes, the nineteenth century had morphed into the  
twenty-first century with the Oxford octogenarian research assistant 28 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
leading the visiting researcher from the past to the future of searching  
for knowledge.  
However, the major advancement in Internet search engine devel-  
opment was still to come. In 2012, through Google Drive searches  
using cloud-based technology were finally possible. Google described  
this innovation as “a collective encyclopedia project based on Goo-  
gle Drive public files and on the crowd sharing, crowd sourcing, and  
crowd-solving principles.”  
Table 1.2 depicts the historical timeline of the development of  
search engines.  
THE MEETINGS AND EVENTS TECHNOLOGY GOLDEN  
TRIANGLE  
Figure 1.4 depicts the key forces that have contributed to the dra-  
matic increase in technology development and use during the past  
half century.

ADVANCEMENTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA  
The golden triangle of advancement in meeting and event technol-  
ogy must finally include the development of social media. With Face-  
book now connecting to over one billion “friends” worldwide \(a 300%  
growth in five years\) and LinkedIn growing from 0 to over 225 million  
members in ten years and Twitter tracking over 340 million tweets per  
day, and finally, YouTube’s one billion users watching over six billion  
hours of video each month, this is a major cornerstone that will pro-  
mote future grown in this sector.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
During the past half decade, meeting and event technology has rap-  
idly developed and is now moving toward standardization through  
the influence of APEX and others. Meetings and events are essen-  
tially a social as well as educational enterprise and therefore advance-  
ments in technology should enhance and not replace the face-to-face  
experience of delegates. Future innovations will occur in each of the  
three cornerstones of the golden triangle, as shown in Figure 1.4.  
These developments will expand the ever-growing technology pie  
and enable future meeting and event technologists to more quickly  
reach more people with higher quality experiences at potentially  
lower costs.

INTRODUCTION  
In Chapter 1, seventy-five years of meeting and event technology his-  
tory were explored to better understand the rapid development of this  
field of study. This chapter also began to look forward to better under-  
stand those emerging technologies that will impact meetings and  
events in the near future. In Chapter 2, we will examine the various  
options that you have in selecting the most appropriate technologi-  
cal solutions for your future current and future meetings or events.  
According to The Economist in 2010, Apple announced that their App  
Store listed 225,000 applications and that they were downloaded five  
billion times. Therefore, the technological options for potential use  
in research, designing, planning, coordinating, and evaluating your  
potential meeting are growing exponentially. As Dr. Seuss, the famed  
children’s author \(whose books have sold over 200 million copies to  
date\), suggests, thinking ahead is essential if we are to know which  
way to turn and not be left behind.  
GAP ANALYSIS AND DECISION MAKING FOR  
MEETING AND EVENT TECHNOLOGY  
How do you avoid putting a technological square peg into a meeting or  
event solution’s round hole? The owner of a family hardware store once  
taught his son that the most important task is first to understand how  
to select the appropriate tool to perform the job in the most high qual-  
ity and efficient manner. When the son asked for a practical demon-  
stration of this advice, his father placed before him a hammer and a  
screw driver and a screw along with a nail. The father asked his son toUsing the Right Technology for the Right Purpose select the tool to affix the screw to the wall. The son selected the ham-  
mer and said, “This will get the job done in record time.” The father said  
“Yes, however, the screw will be damaged and it will not be as securely  
affixed as if you had taken the time to screw it into the wall.” He then  
demonstrated this action and the negative reaction as the screw bent in  
half and refused to adhere to the wall.  
With the millions of mobile applications and software now available  
to improve your professional practice and the attendee experience in  
the meetings and events industry, it is important to know how to select  
the right tool for the right job. One way this is conducted is through a  
process developed by Yakov Ben-Haim in the 1980s and known as Gap  
Analysis Decision Making \(Ben-Haim, 2010\).  
UNCERTAINTY MODEL  
According to Ben-Haim, decision making may be seen through three  
models. The first model is called uncertainty. Starting from the esti-  
mate, an uncertainty model measures how distant other values of the  
parameter are from the estimate\: as uncertainty increases, the set of  
possible values increase—if one is this uncertain in the estimate, what  
other parameters are possible?  
MEETING AND EVENT TECHNOLOGY EXAMPLE  
If you are planning a city-wide meeting that will require most of the  
accommodations in a city or region, and these arrangements and con-  
tracts must be signed five years in the future, there is a high degree of  
uncertainty of the technological needs and requirements that may be  
needed. One example of this future planning was the construction of  
the Washington, DC Convention Center, when pipes and tubes were  
planned by the architect for future technologies that has not yet been  
invented. The architect and convention center planners were indeed  
looking to the future, one that at that time was uncertain in detailing  
the types of technologies that would be needed, but certain that they  
must anticipate future needs.

ROBUSTNESS/OPPORTUNENESS MODEL  
The second model of decision making as stated by Ben-Haim is one  
that assumes there is a certain degree of robustness of information  
available and opportuneness. Given an uncertainty model and a min-  
imum level of desired outcome, then for each decision, how uncer-  
tain can you be and be assured of achieving this minimum level?  
\(This is called the robustness of the decision.\) Conversely, given a  
desired windfall outcome, how uncertain must you be for this desir-  
able outcome to be possible? \(This is called the opportuneness of the  
decision.\)  
MEETING AND TECHNOLOGY EXAMPLE  
If you are planning a recurring meeting or event and have significant  
data available from which to make a decision, you may wish to make  
a decision based upon this data. Furthermore, if you have the strong  
potential of receiving new revenue through commercial sponsorship  
or in-kind contributions of technology to foster experimentation with  
technological solutions for your meeting or event, this is known as a  
desired windfall outcome. One example of this is the wide range of  
technology providers that support the annual Professional Convention  
Management Association \(PCMA\) Convening Leaders conference.  
Through the data collected over many years by PCMA, they are able to  
make a robust decision regarding the educational needs of their mem-  
bers and satisfy these needs in part through enhanced technologies.  
As a result of providing these technological platforms, a large number  
of technology companies have stepped forward to provide educational  
programs and demonstrations to enable PCMA members to experi-  
ment with new solutions for their business challenges. The windfall  
of this outcome is increased sponsorship funding for PCMA and new  
opportunities for their members to explore emerging technologies at  
low to no cost.  
According to Michelle Russell, editor in chief of the PCMA’s  
magazine Convene, “We need to collect explicit data from eventUsing the Right Technology for the Right Purpose participants. People now read and share differently, so we need to  
find new ways through technology to build better profiles about our  
participants.”  
DECISION-MAKING MODEL  
The third and final decision model is concerned with having sufficient  
information and the essential time frame in which to make this deci-  
sion. According to Ben-Haim, in order to decide, one optimizes either  
the robustness or the opportuneness on the basis of the robustness or  
opportuneness model. Given a desired minimum outcome, which deci-  
sion is most robust \(can stand the most uncertainty\) and still give the  
desired outcome \(the robust-satisfying action\)? Alternatively, given a  
desired windfall outcome, which decision requires the least uncertainty  
for the outcome to be achievable \(the opportune-wind falling action\)?  
\(Ben-Haim, 2010\)  
MEETING AND TECHNOLOGY EXAMPLE  
In an opportune technology environment, the meeting and event pro-  
fessional would always have the time frame and information needed  
to make the best decision. For example, when your meeting and event  
organization is considering refreshing your website, the project scope  
will specify a period of time to accomplish the tasks required to reach  
this milestone. Furthermore, within the given time frame the decision  
will be robust and may result in a desired windfall \(such as additional  
revenues from commercial advertising or sponsorship or philan-  
thropy\). Therefore, the decision-making model as argued by Ben-Haim  
requires sufficient information \(research\) and an essential time frame  
\(specified to satisfy the aims and objectives of the meeting and event  
planning organization\).  
The scientist Stephen Wolfram \(2002\) further states that decision  
making is also based upon careful analysis of patterns. Wolfram,  
who conceived the mathematical software program Mathematica,  
argues that the mathematical is split into two parts, the kernel and  
² 37 38 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
the front end. The kernel interprets expressions \(mathematics\) and  
returns the resulting expressions. In “A New Kind of Science,” Wol-  
fram explains through his analysis of millions of computations that a  
problem may be solved and decisions made if it meets the following  
five characteristics\:  
1\. Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical  
illustration  
2\. It can be completely explained in a few sentences of human  
language  
3\. It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few  
lines of code  
4\. The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all  
of them can be computed  
5\. Patterns \(outliers\), processes \(community\), probable outcomes  
\(change\) are predictable. \(Wolfram, 2002\)  
It may therefore be further argued that by applying Wolfram’s the-  
ory of cellular automata to meeting and event technology, some future  
technology developments are predictable. Vorob describes this mathe-  
matical predictive process as eventology.  
Professor Oleg Vorob is known in the field of mathematics as the  
‘“father of eventology.” According to Vorob, Goldblatt, and Finkel,  
eventology is a new direction of probability theory and philosophy that  
offers the original event approach to the description of variability and  
ignorance, entering an agent, together with his/her beliefs, directly in  
the frameworks of scientific research in the form of eventological dis-  
tribution of his/her own events \(Goldblatt et al, 2009\).  
Further supporting Ben-Haim’s decision-making model, the more  
robust the information, the closer the distribution of factors in terms  
of decision making. The key application for the meetings and events  
industry is the importance of robust record keeping by meeting and  
event planners to reduce uncertainty and to promote robustness andUsing the Right Technology for the Right Purpose windfall outcomes and lead to improved and more rapid decision  
making.  
Once you have learned how to make the right meeting and tech-  
nology decision at the right time by using the appropriate tool for your  
meeting or event task, it is important to link these decisions to actual  
meeting and event technology products and services. Table 2.1 depicts  
a few examples of the most common technology decisions that must be  
made for your meeting or event in each of the five phases identified by  
Goldblatt \(2013\).  
The number of potential meeting and event technological solutions will  
continue to grow rapidly. Your task will be to know how to frame the  
correct questions to ensure that the decisions you make are informed  
by the best research, evidence, and potential sustainable outcomes for  
your organization. The following five questions and potential answers  
in Table 2.2 provide guidance on how to frame these future questions  
to best serve the current and future technological needs of your meet-  
ing and event organization.  
Asking the right question at the right time is equally important to  
finding the right tool for the right job. It is critically important that you  
take the time to conduct the needed research, to ask the right questions

SCREENSHOT  
A meeting planner in the 1980s decided to design his own custom-  
ized event management software to solve several business problems.  
The problems included maintaining a list of suppliers, managing his  
clients, and controlling revenue and expense. He hired a computer con-  
sultant who devoted many months to creating a customized system.  
The meeting planner soon learned that there were similar systems  
were available at a fraction of the cost of the customized program. If  
the meeting planner had first researched available software and then  
engaged the consultant to adapt the commercially available software,  
he would have saved thousands of dollars and been able to use the  
system several months earlier. Always check and see what software  
systems may be available before seeking a custom program for your  
organization.  
through each phase of the work flow which tool will best serve your  
future needs.  
The key meeting and event technological tools for  
event marketing, request for proposals, planning,  
registration, on-site management, attendee  
applications and evaluation  
According to Silvers \(2012\) there are six dimensions of the meeting and  
event attendee experience. These dimensions encompass anticipation,  
arrival, atmosphere, appetite, activities, and amenities. Technology may  
positively impact each one of these six critical attendee experiences.  
The pre-event research that you conduct using electronic question-  
naires may help determine the attendee’s future needs, wants, and desires  
while attending your meeting or event. This research will help you better  
anticipate their needs. The firm MeetingMatrics describes this phase of  
research on their dashboard as discovery. Through discovering the pref-  
erences of your attendees, you may better plan for the future needs.42 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Once you have identified your attendees’ needs, wants, and desires,  
you may then proceed to designing the offer that will attract their  
interest and motivate them to attend your meeting or event. This is  
the moment when your marketing research conducted through tech-  
nology is transformed into strategic actions \(tactics\) through advertis-  
ing, promotion, and public relations. Each of these tactics is conducted  
using meeting and event technological systems.  
Advertising is the message about your meeting and event that you  
control. One critical way to control this message is through the design  
and management of an effective website. The website becomes the cen-  
tral portal through which your prospective and future attendees may  
discover, explore, recommend to others, and ultimately register for  
your meeting and event.  
Promotion is the opportunity to use an online survey, poll, or other  
interactive tool to deeply engage with your prospective meeting and event  
attendees. The results from these surveys, polls, or other tools may then be  
published in real time on your official meeting and event website.  
Public relations is based on research that you disseminate through  
traditional media, such as radio, television, and the Internet, to fur-  
ther persuade your prospective meeting and event attendees to register.  
According to Preston \(2012\), public relations may be used effectively  
to positively influence your prospective attendees to register for your  
meeting or event.  
While your meeting or event may be marketed to prospective  
attendees several years in advance, the elements that will produce a  
successful outcome are acquired through a request for proposal \(RFP\)  
process. This process may take place many years in advance if the meet-  
ing or event is large in scope or just a few days in advance depending  
upon the size of your program.  
Traditionally, the request for proposal process was conducted by  
meeting and event planners through a combination of recommenda-  
tions, research, telephonic interviews, and finally postal solicitations ofUsing the Right Technology for the Right Purpose proposals. Over time, as the Internet rapidly developed, the RFP pro-  
cess moved to a seamless and real-time electronic platform.  
Cvent is one online provider of RFP management systems. Their  
database network of 75,000 meeting and event venues helps create a  
seamless system for conducting the RFP process. According to Cvent,  
their planner-friendly supplier search engine provides detailed sup-  
plier profiles with extensive facility descriptions, meeting space capac-  
ity charts, floor plans, and amenities, as well as exclusive promotions,  
images of venues, virtual tours and more \(Cvent, 2008\).  
Peppermill Resort in Reno, Nevada, uses MeetingMatrix to allow  
potential meeting and event planners to download to scale venue dia-  
grams and submit immediate request for proposals. According to Pep-  
² 43  
SCREENSHOT  
At one time the standard operating procedure for requesting a pro-  
posal from a meeting and event supplier was to pick up the telephone  
and ask for their proposal. The proposal was later sent by facsimile  
to the meeting planner. This was a cumbersome and time-consuming  
process. It was also fraught with error because the meeting and event  
planner’s needs could be miscommunicated to the supplier. One time  
an event planner requested a RFP from a hotel. Within a few days the  
proposal was received, and following agreement by all parties a con-  
tract was issued by the hotel. However, the meeting and event plan-  
ner used a third party to negotiate the contract; the wrong start time  
for the opening event was included in the final banquet event order  
\(BEO\) at the hotel. The guests arrived early, one hour in advance of  
the start time on the invitation. Fortunately, the hotel staff sprung into  
action and received the guests as though they were on time. The elec-  
tronic RFP process not only promotes efficiency and speed, but it also  
helps to ensure accuracy through transparency. All parties should  
have access to the critical information to be able to check and recheck  
important details such as start times. 44 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
permill sales staff, MeetingMatrix allows planners to plan their meetings  
and events directly online \(Peppermill Resort, 2014\). The ability to  
reduce travel expense and time and to receive accurate information in  
real time is why tens of thousands of meeting and event venue as well  
as other suppliers have made the transition to the online RFP system.  
Dan Berger is the founder and chief executive of the diagramming  
software solution Social Tables, technology that plays an increasingly  
important role during the event planning phase. Berger states\:  
Today’s diagramming solutions \(such as Social Tables\) are finally  
liberating the hotel and venue sector from the responsibility of own-  
ing the floor plan. These new technological solutions allow planners  
to create the room set that aligns with their meetings’ objectives.  
Smart diagramming solutions have a recommendation engine to  
make intelligent, research-backed meeting design suggestions to the  
planners using them in order to further drive their ROO \(return on  
objectives\).  
Taking this concept one step further, future iterations of such soft-  
ware can leverage machine learning to drive meeting effectiveness  
by comparing survey results to room setups in order to identify  
the most effective meeting design concepts \(Berger, 2014\).  
Therefore, one key potential outcome of the rapid expansion of  
technology for event planners is the opportunity to rapidly promote  
symbiosis between different technological platforms. For example, as  
Berger suggests, in the near future your participant seating decisions  
may be directly driven by previous feedback that is recorded in a totally  
separate but symbiotic technological platform.  
What are the appropriate levels of training that will  
be needed for new technologies?  
Every new technological solution should have a prescribed training  
period to ensure careful universal adoption by all critical stakeholders.Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose The type of training and its length will be determined by the level of  
technological sophistication of the stakeholders and the complexity  
of the new software being adopted. Table 2.3 provides a list of key  
questions to ask when negotiating training for your new technological  
programs.  
Before scheduling your first training session, conduct an internal  
assessment of the technology experience and confidence level of those  
who will be trained. Share this assessment information with your train-  
ing provider so that the training is offered at the appropriate level. Table  
2.4 provides a simple survey instrument to identify the level of staff  
confidence and skill.

the modules you need or must you learn everything all at once?  
10\. Know the accessibility of upgrades to your current software.

When negotiating costs for training there is often a wide range  
of options. Some firms include some complimentary, free training  
with the purchase of their software. However, other firms will charge  
by the participant or a flat rate for the day or entire training period.  
SCREENSHOT  
“My eyes are killing me!” groaned the meeting and event planner  
after several hours of training in new event management software.  
The trainer had failed to enlarge the typeface that was projected on  
the screen, and after several hours of squinting he had a splitting  
headache. Looking down at his laptop screen, he noticed that there  
was a bright glaring gleam that made it difficult to see his work.  
Between the projection screen and his personal screen, he was slowly  
going blind. When arranging technology training, try to experience  
it from the potential students’ view and make them as comfortable as  
possible for the rigorous training they will soon undertake. Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose Remember, this is always negotiable and you should ask other meet-  
ing and event professionals who have used the same supplier about  
their payment levels and conditions.  
Adapting new technologies for specific meetings  
and events purpose  
Several new technologies have been developed in other fields such  
as Quick Response \(QR\) codes and Radio Frequency Identification  
\(RFID\) chips and scanners. These technologies were first developed to  
maintain accurate inventory for millions of retail products. In recent  
years they have been adapted for the meetings and events industry with  
some degree of success.  
It is rarely possible to take a technology from another industry and  
assume that it will work just as effectively in the highly complex and  
variable industry of meetings and events. Because the meetings and  
events industry is essentially the people industry, there will always be  
nuances and variances as no two delegates are alike.  
For example, when using RFID technology some attendees may  
refuse to wear a chip for religious purposes or simply because they  
² 47  
SCREENSHOT  
While attending a large convention in Dallas, Texas, the attendee did  
not realize his name badge included a microchip that was being read  
by QR scanners throughout the convention center. When he rose to  
go to the toilet in the middle of a large plenary session, his name sud-  
denly flashed on the large screens at the front of the room. His name  
badge had signalled the scanner that he was leaving the room and  
he was embarrassed as several attendees laughed at his grand exit.  
When using QR codes and scanners, notify attendees during the reg-  
istration and ask them to tick a box confirming their acceptance of the  
microchipped badge. Always let them know what you will be doing  
with the data you collect and how it will be protected in the future. 48 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
do not wish to be followed and tracked by the ubiquitous scanners  
throughout the venue. Still other attendees may not wish to use their  
mobile device to scan a QR code as this requires an additional step  
in their delegate experience. Therefore, before introducing these tech-  
nologies into your meeting or event, it is important to conduct pilot  
tests and receive feedback from your attendees so you may make any  
necessary adjustments prior to the full roll out of the technology for all  
attendees.  
Table 2.5 provides examples of how to use QR codes and RFID  
scanners effectively to manage your meeting or event.  
There are now hundreds of thousands of mobile applications now  
available, and to many meeting and event planners the choice of an  
appropriate application for their meeting or event may appear to be  
confusing. However, this process may be simplified by first following  
these guidelines.  
Table 2.5. Opportunities for Using QR Codes and RFID Systems  
1\. The QR code may be used to provide detailed information from a  
website for the delegate about poster presentations, new products  
and services at an exhibition, and other critical elements within your  
meeting and event.  
2\. The QR code may be used to provide the attendee with additional  
sources, references, and other material that will enrich their learn-  
ing experience.  
3\. The RFID system may be used to monitor attendance at individual  
sessions.  
4\. The RFID system may be used to monitor the flow of your attendees  
through the meeting and event.  
5\. The RFID system may be used to monitor the interest levels of your  
attendees by tracking which trade show booths they visit and for  
how long they remain in each booth.  
\(Adapted from Montgomery, 2013\) Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose Always begin by surveying your attendees to determine the types of  
technology they are using \(Android or iPhone\).  
Ask your attendees about their needs, wants, and desires for tech-  
nology before, during, and following the meeting or event.  
Finally, investigate the Wi-Fi capacity for your meeting or event  
venue in advance to determine if your attendees can easily to access  
your applications.  
² 49  
SCREENSHOT  
A medical conference was held in Barcelona for over 10,000 doctors,  
scientists, and researchers. The professional conference organizer  
\(PCO\) decided to use a mobile application for the attendees to access  
the program. This would be the first ever paperless program for this  
conference.  
During the first hour of the conference 10,000 attendees received  
ERROR messages on their mobile application. Following an investiga-  
tion, the planners discovered that the number of users had exceeded  
the Wi-Fi capacity for the venue.  
To resolve this problem, the planners immediately sent an e-mail to  
all users with a PDF attachment of the printed program. Although the  
attachment was not searchable, it did allow the attendees to find their  
seminar rooms.  
For application access your attendees will need 3G or 4G connec-  
tions throughout their mobile devices \(telephones, tablets, laptop com-  
puters\). According to Diffen.com the definition of second generation,

3G \(or 3rd generation\) was launched in Japan in 2001. As recently as  
mid-2010, the networks for most wireless carriers in the U.S. were 3G.  
3G networks were a significant improvement over 2G networks, offer-  
ing higher speeds for data transfer. The improvement that 4G offers  
over 3G is often less pronounced. Analysts use the analogy of stan-  
dard vs high-definition television to describe the difference between  
3G and 4G \(Diffen.com, 2013\). Table 2.6 compares the development  
and capacity of 3G versus 4G technology.  
Wi-Fi  
According to The Wi-Fi Alliance, Wi-Fi is defined as any wireless local  
area network \(WLAN\) that are based upon the Institute of ElectricalUsing the Right Technology for the Right Purpose and Electronics Engineers 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi is therefore a syn-  
onym for WLAN \(Webopedia, 2014\).  
According to Scott Reeves of Ruckus Wireless, to deliver seamless  
Wi-Fi for 10,000 persons, you must consider using Wi-Fi applications  
positioned throughout the venue.  
If you’re expecting 10,000 or even 20,000 people to attend a huge  
exhibition, you can also be fairly sure that not all of them will  
be accessing the wireless network at the same time. If you think  
about the WOMAD \(World of Music, Arts and Dance\) festival  
that took place at the end of July, the event attracted some 40,000  
visitors, but there were never more than 500 concurrent users  
on the Wi-Fi network, with around 2,000 unique users in total.  
Traffic on the guest network never exceeded the 100MB back-  
haul connection.  
At the WOMAD festival, we were able to guarantee reliable  
Wi-Fi access for both guests and organizers using 35 APs \(access  
points\) positioned at various points throughout the 350-acre  
site, with more near the main stage and in other densely pop-  
ulated areas. This meant that each AP had to support no more  
than 100 users at any given time; with the back-up, it could scale  
to support 200 users during peak times. Load balancing like this  
is key to ensuring that no single AP becomes overloaded and  
impacts on the user experience. Another factor to consider is  
RF \(radio frequency\) management—using beamforming tech-  
nology, it is simple to maximize throughput from each AP and  
minimize the impact of interference from neighboring devices.  
\(Diffen, 2013\)  
Therefore, when planning to incorporate mobile applications  
within the context of your meeting or event, extensive pre-planning is  
required to ensure seamless delivery. You may also wish to incorporate  
signage as shown in Figure 2.1 below to identify Wi-Fi hot spots where  
connectivity is stronger for your attendees.

with their mobile applications, it is important to consider the type and  
range of applications that you may wish to use for your meeting or event.  
The first question you must ask is why you want to incorporate an  
AP or several APs into your meeting or event experience. For example,  
do you wish to try and reduce your event’s carbon footprint? Do you  
want to use an AP to increase the convenience level for your attendees  
\(an electronic program versus a larger bulky paper one\)? Do you want to  
send \(push\) announcements to your attendees? Finally, do you want to  
increase the networking capacity among your attendees before, during,  
and after the meeting or event?  
According to meeting and event technology expert Corbin Ball  
\(2014\), Certified Meeting Professional \(CMP\) and Certified Special  
Events Professional \(CSP\), you should incorporate the following con-  
siderations into your decision making\:  
■  
Data connection\: All apps should include an offline mode,  
meaning no data connection is needed once the application is  
installed or saved within the browser. However, for updates or  
push notifications, the apps require some data connection. If a  
connection is not available onsite, a hybrid or native app would  
be more stable on most phones.  
■  
User experience\: Because hybrid and native apps are downloaded,  
many prefer their faster, smoother access to information such as■

■  
Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose speaker bios and agendas. For polling, audience response and sur-  
vey tools, they also provide a better user experience. If there is no  
signal when taking surveys, for instance, both hybrid and native  
apps hold the data and send it when there is a connection.  
Community involvement\: Developers of hybrid and native  
apps have made great strides in social interaction by allowing  
push technology to be used within the apps. For example, many  
developers now embed the use of the device’s camera within the  
app to post pictures more efficiently than web apps.  
Cost\: While hybrid and web-based apps are typically faster to  
deploy and less expensive, the newest technology for these options  
have made it possible to develop apps that offer many of the same  
experiences as native apps. So if you do not require advanced pro-  
gramming, it is likely the best way to go. Native apps tend to cost  
more because they require custom coding of features, use of the  
device hardware, and GPS \(Global Positioning System\).  
Design elements\: The beauty of apps in today’s market is that  
look and feel, branding, menu/navigation, and sponsorship  
options can all be customized and can function similarly no  
matter the app platforms.  
Content\: Both static content and dynamic content, such as reg-  
istration, can be formatted for hybrid, web-based, and native  
apps. Attendees’ needs and planner recommendations should  
determine the app content. At a minimum, most audiences  
expect agenda/speaker information and meeting room maps.  
Audience demographics\: Knowing your audience is crucial  
when deciding on what app to deploy. If you are in an industry  
that relies heavily on tablets or iPads, your audience is probably  
most familiar with native apps. If this is the case, hybrid apps  
can be a great option to offer a native app experience without  
the custom programming cost. In contrast, if your audience is  
a late adopter to mobile devices, using a browser to view the  
content is likely preferred. \(Ball, 2014\)  
² 53 54 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Once you have considered these key points, then you should begin to  
consult with a wide variety of application providers to identify those that  
provide the best value for your investment and offer the strongest tech-  
nical support for your attendees. It is important to note that every day  
hundreds or perhaps thousands of new applications are being developed.  
Therefore, you should proceed carefully to identify the best provider for  
your meeting and event today as well as for the next few years. Attendees  
prefer to use an application that is familiar rather than having to learn a  
new application every year.  
The main aim in adopting new technology for your meeting or  
event is to increase overall productivity for planners and their attend-  
ees. This may be accomplished through continuous evaluation and  
analysis to demonstrate improvement year upon year.  
Continually evaluating and analyzing meeting  
and event technological productivity to promote  
continuous improvement  
There are several methods for evaluating and analyzing meeting and  
event technological productivity. Traditionally, this measurement has  
been decentralized and therefore the results are not always valid and  
reliable. Figure 2.2 depicts a model for comprehensively evaluating  
Figure 2.2. Comprehensive Evaluation Elements of Various Stakeholders  
\(Source\: Goldblatt, 2014\). Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose meeting and event technological productivity that will join up all of the  
feedback from the stakeholders within your organization.  
The methods that you use to evaluate these outcomes may vary  
widely depending upon the individual needs of your meeting or event.  
However, it is important to avoid the mistake of looking for simple  
solutions to this process. The potential hierarchy of meeting and event  
technological evaluation is depicted in Figure 2.3.  
As Figure 2.3 depicts, the user engagement outcomes are the high-  
est level of evaluation desired from the measurement process. How  
many times do your users engage with the technology you have intro-  
duced and how long to they engage each time they log in? The next  
level of measurement is the user experience. How easy and friendly do  
your users find the new technology you have introduced? Finally, while  
connectivity and speed are important metrics of evaluation, this is only  
the gateway to the higher levels of experience—which is experience  
and engagement.  
The introduction of new meeting and event technologies brings  
new risks for your meeting and event organization. However, nothing  
² 55  
Figure 2.3. User Technology Hierarchy of Evaluation 56 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
ventured, nothing gained. Indeed, a new technological advancement  
is a new venture for your organization and should be welcomed as an  
opportunity to find new and better ways of delivering a better experi-  
ence for your staff, suppliers, and attendees.  
Traditionally risk is managed by controlling three variables. The  
term ART means avoid, reduce, and transfer and may be applied to  
your technology decisions.  
You may wish to avoid certain risks by not using certain technolo-  
gies. For example, if you are using Wi-Fi technology in a public build-  
ing, you may wish to avoid using unsecure public servers and instead  
use a secure, private server to help ensure your data is not available to  
others.  
However, you may be able to reduce some risks by incorporating  
your meeting and event technology supplier as a consultant through  
the testing process. Furthermore, you may wish to include a security  
statement on your registration page notifying your attendees that their  
information is being encrypted for security purposes. Finally, you may  
wish to use a decoding device to authenticate that the person signing  
into your registration website has the capacity to complete the neces-  
sary fields. Figure 2.4 provides examples of a security certificate and a  
decoding window.  
Internet security has become a major concern for meeting and event  
organizations due to the increased number of cyber attacks. Therefore,  
Figure 2.4. Examples of a Security Certificate and Decoding Window Using the Right Technology for the Right Purpose reducing the ability of unscrupulous individuals to access your website  
and information infrastructure is extremely important.  
The third and final method of controlling risk is to transfer some  
or all of the risk to others. You may do this with a statement on your  
website that limits your risk and transfers some or all of the risk to  
the user or to your security partner. You may wish to include a state-  
ment with a tick box as show below that informs the user of their  
future risks, such as\:  
² 57  
Every reasonable effort has been made to protect your secu-  
rity. However, it is impossible to guarantee one hundred per-  
cent security. Therefore, the user understands and accepts that  
by submitting their data they are also accepting these inherent  
risks.  
❑  
Tick the box above to confirm your under-  
standing and acceptance of this risk.  
It is important to note that many countries and regional govern-  
mental bodies, most especially the United Kingdom and the Euro-  
pean Union, have strong data protection laws that may require more  
stringent protections be provided by meeting and event planners  
when accepting and guarding attendee data. \(For more information,  
visit\: http\://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index\_en.htm.\)  
SCREENSHOT  
In 2000, as a result of the clocks changing due to the start of the new  
millennium, many insurance companies specifically excluded com-  
puter technology as a risk they would cover in the instance of a tech-  
nological malfunction at midnight.  
Even today not every insurance policy will cover data security and  
other issues related to meeting and event technology. Therefore,  
before you transfer the risk to an insurance company, check carefully  
for all exclusions that may involve your technological assets. 58 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Selecting and effectively using the appropriate technology for your  
meeting and event is one of the great challenges of the twenty-first cen-  
tury for planners. However, the range, scope, breadth, and depth of  
applications and solutions that are now available helps ensure that you  
will find the right tool for the right job. Once you have selected the right  
tool, it is essential that you learn how to use it confidently, and that is  
why training and support from your technology provider is extremely  
important. Finally, with new emerging technologies come new risks.  
Therefore, you must avoid, reduce, and transfer these risks whenever  
possible to reduce injuring your attendees as well as diminishing the  
reputational advantage of your organization.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. How do you know which technology tools will provide the  
most efficient and effective outcomes for your meeting and  
event organization?  
2\. How do you select a proper technology provider and assess  
their ability to provide training and support?  
3\. How do you avoid, reduce, and transfer the risk when  
adopting new meeting and event technologies?  
TASK  
Create a request for proposal \(RFP\) to submit to three technology pro-  
viders \(suppliers\) to provide a meeting and event registration appli-  
cation for use by your attendees. Your attendees are located in ten  
different countries and use three different currencies \(British Stirling,  
Canadian dollars, and U.S. dollars\).

INTRODUCTION  
Let’s start with one question\: Where do you go if you need infor-  
mation? Without any doubt the majority of people today will open  
a search engine site. Billions of searches are conducted every sin-  
gle day on popular search engines and social networking websites  
by people all around the world. For many that is not only the first  
place for information, but the only one, so we have to do our best to  
make our sites visible and accessible if we want our potential guests  
to find us quickly and easily. “Google continues to dominate the list  
of most used search engines. Asked which search engine they use  
most often, 83% of search users say Google” \(Purcell, Brenner, and  
Rainie, 2012\). However, this is not the only important thing to bear  
in mind. Studies show that most users, in fact, skip to the organic  
results, without paying attention to the advertisements on the top.  
Usually the first three results receive attention. This phenomenon is  
called the Golden Triangle. Of course, it is difficult to get there, but  
not impossible.  
Around 83% of the people are a serious enough reason to start  
thinking about SEO long before we start the communication of our  
event. This is especially true if the event website plays a pivotal role  
in selling tickets, getting new registrations, or spreading the word for  
your event. SEO is an acronym for “search engine optimization”. It is  
the process of increasing the number of visitors to a website by achiev-  
ing high rank in the search results of a search engine. The higher a  
website ranks in the results of a search, the greater the chance that  
users will visit the site. It is common practice for Internet users not  
to click past the first few pages of search results, therefore high rank  
in SERPs \(search engine results pages\) is essential for obtaining traf-  
fic for a site. SEO helps to ensure that a site is accessible to a search  
engine and improves the chances that the site will be indexed andMeeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 63  
ranked favorably by the search engine \(LaFerney, 2007\). It is obvious  
that nowadays we cannot ignore the importance of having high rank.  
Although there are numerous tactics to achieve this, most specialists  
agree that interesting and involving content is still a very important  
element for success.  
THE ANSWERING MACHINE  
From users’ point of view search engines have to provide answers—  
quickly and precisely. Most of us have neither the time nor realize the  
necessity to reflect on how to approach this task. What we want are  
answers. We have to remember that the primary responsibility of those  
engines is to offer relevant results to their users. If they manage to do  
it, users will come back again and again when they need answers. To be  
able to supply us with answers, the right ones, they have a very com-  
plicated system, which will not be discussed here. However, we will  
presently talk about the steps we need to take, considering some small  
details in order to receive a better rank.  
If you consider more carefully what you are searching for, you will  
come up with the following three main reasons\:  
■  
To do something\: You want to buy tickets, clothes, books, mov-  
ies etc. You know what you want, but you need either a better  
offer or a cheap or fast delivery.  
■  
To gain further knowledge\: You need information about a topic,  
problem, etc.  
■ To open a particular page\: With all those new technologies no  
one can remember the address of the pages they visit.  
That is why it will be not exaggerated to say that many of us do those  
things every single day. Now we can search even for pictures, to find  
out who is in the picture, get the name of a song. In fact, search engines  
influence not only our online behavior but what we do offline as well.  
So, if we want more guests at our event, we have to do our best to come  
out on top in search results.64 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
WHAT SEO CAN DO  
With the development of technology the algorithm of these machines  
changes. Yet, there is something that comprises a significant part and  
influences results—the popularity of the page. If a lot of people spend  
time on your page, if they come back and share with their network, that  
means popularity \(or importance\), and search engines want to offer that  
great page to its users. Search engines offer information about their rules.

\#1  If you use an online form, accessible after login, it cannot be reached  
by search engines.

the search engines will ignore it, as they are searching for unique  
content.

at risk not to be indexed.  
Figure 3.2. A Few Important Limitations for Event Planners Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 65  
Of course there are limitations. In Fig. 3.2 you can see some of the most  
important limitations, according the event management profession.  
It is important to know exactly what to expect from SEO, what we  
can do better, and what has to be done by experts. The difficulty here  
is that each single page of your website should be easy to use both  
for consumers and search engine robots. In many cases not being  
specialists, we tend to focus more on the user’s experience than on  
the search engine itself. The main goal of SEO is to make each page  
accessible and readable for robots. Since robots collect information  
about your pages, if the information is not given in the proper way,  
it will be ignored.  
THE BASICS OF SEO  
The father of modern public relations, Edward L. Bernays, said that in  
times of mass communication, to be modest is a personal virtue and a  
public vice. Therefore, we have to do our best to let people know about  
our event. Some experts call search engine specialists the lobbyists of  
the future because assisted by them you can be on the top of organic  
results—those that are not paid. They know much better than we do  
how those engines work.  
We can find out how search engines see our site by using seo-  
browser.com. The simple analysis is free. It is enough to get an impres-  
sion of what you have done right, or what is wrong. Sometimes to  
have a great look means to be invisible for the search engines. The best  
combination is to have plain text, with your keywords, and pictures  
or video that are supplementary to the content. Do not rely only on  
visuals.  
WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR BETTER SEO  
Of course, the best way is to have a budget for working with the best  
professionals in order to get the best results, though sometimes that  
is not possible. We hope that you will have the opportunity to work66 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
with the top specialists. However, if in some cases you have to count on  
yourself, here are some helpful insights.  
KEYWORDS  
“It’s only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away”. You  
may remember those words from the Bee Gees song. We can say that  
regarding all technologies and advances in computer programming\:  
words, especially keywords, are still the main tool by which people  
search. That means we have to walk in users’ shoes and see how to use  
those keywords in the best possible way. Since good, attention-grab-  
bing content is the most efficient way to get a good ranking, we have to  
focus on that, as we are responsible for writing the content for our web-  
site. It goes without saying that keywords are fundamental for search-  
ing. The first thing we do when we want to search is type a combination  
of words in the browser. So, if you want your page to appear in a higher  
position for “events”, you have to be sure that the word “events” is part  
of your content that will be indexed. The first thing you have to do is  
to think about your keywords. After that, it is a good idea to try to  
imagine what words your potential guests will be using to search about  
DEFINITION\: Metadata describes other data. It provides infor-  
mation about a certain item’s content. For example, an image may  
include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color  
depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, and other  
data. A text document’s metadata may contain information about  
how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was  
written, and a short summary of the document.  
Web pages often include metadata in the form of meta tags. Descrip-  
tion and keyword meta tags are commonly used to describe the web  
page’s content. Most search engines use this data when adding pages  
to their search index. \(Techterms.com, 2014\) Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 67  
your event. It is precisely from those two lists that you have to make up  
your own keywords. If you decide to choose general keywords as event,  
special event, conference, your work will be very difficult, as everyone  
in the industry is using them. Moreover, there is a very small chance for  
users to search for those general terms without any additional word. So  
the best idea is to choose more specific words that describe your unique  
event and use them naturally in the text on the pages of your website.  
The best you can do for the optimization of your pages is to make sure  
keywords are used naturally in titles, texts, and metadata.  
Relying on our experience as SEO specialists, we would suggest  
that you take the following steps\:  
■ Put the keyword in the title tag  
A title tag, the main text that describes an online document,  
is the second most important on–page SEO element \(the most  
important being overall content\). It appears in three key places\:  
browsers, search engine result pages, and external websites  
\(Moz, 2014b\). Careful choice and application of keywords  
is crucial because the closer the result to the first page is, the  
greater chance you stand to be spotted by users.  
Usually search engines have a limited number of characters that  
appear in the results. At the moment this number is between  
65 and 75. The rest will appear as … So if you want users to  
have a chance to see your keywords, you have to fit your title  
tag in these limitations. Except for the precisely chosen key-  
words, if your brand has good reputation, you have to use it  
here, as people are more likely to trust brands with which they  
are already familiar. In terms of event management, the title  
tag can be viewed as an invitation, the first time your potential  
guest has any contact with your event. We are well aware that  
there is only one opportunity to make a first impression, so we68 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
cannot afford to spoil it. We have to put an effort to make this  
first meeting as emotional as possible, because even though  
people are rational, in most cases they tend to take decisions  
emotionally.  
■ Use it in the first paragraph  
Text is, in fact, the content people are looking for. That is why  
including the information users most probably need is a must.  
A frequent mistake we are inclined to make is to write the text  
only to meet the requirements of our boss. Yet it will not be the  
boss who will be inquiring about the event in different search  
engines, so we have to write for those who are unfamiliar with  
our event and who will be willing to join in after reading the  
text. Consider carefully what kind of information your poten-  
tial guests will need in order to come to the event. Give them  
at least three reasons to attend. Thus, writing your compelling  
text, you have to use your keywords as early as possible.  
■ Say it 2 or 3 times in the body of the text  
The power of words gives us the opportunity to use them in  
different combinations and variations. Bearing this in mind,  
we have to integrate words naturally into our content wher-  
ever they fit best. Talking about keywords, we can include  
phrases too. While working on our first presentation of the  
book, we decided to use “Events without end” as keywords,  
which we then repeated in various parts throughout the book.  
Each of us had the freedom to contribute by making our own  
suggestions. In the end, all guests were well aware that today’s  
events are without end \(just one of all possible variations of  
our keywords\).  
■ Include it in the URL address  
No doubt everyone has seen URL like this\: http\://tedxnbu.com  
/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D  
1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-tedxnbu-2014/.Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 69  
According to all criteria it does not look good at all, so the  
creation of such a URL must be avoided. Although most web  
interfaces give us opportunities to write our URL, we do not  
frequently avail ourselves of these possibilities. In case you find  
it difficult to write your precise URL every time, think of using  
software for short links, which has at least two benefits\: \(1\) the  
link looks much better \(for example, http\://goo.gl/JMvidk\), and  
\(2\) you have access to see where people clicking on your link  
come from. See Figure 3.3 for sites that can provider shorter  
URLs.  
Fortunately, there is technology to help us in every single task  
we want to do. Moreover, there are sites which can help you  
with writing good-looking, relevant URLs. You can use Apache  
Module mod\_rewrite, which provides a rule-based rewrit-  
ing engine to rewrite requested URLs on the fly \(http\://httpd.  
apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod\_rewrite.html\) \(see Fig-  
ure 3.4\) or ISAPI\_Rewrite, which is a powerful URL manip-  
ulation engine based on regular expressions \(see Figure. 3.4\).  
Although its functions are quite similar to those of the Apache’s  
mod\_Rewrite, it is specifically designed for Microsoft’s Internet  
Information Server \(IIS\).

The mod\_rewrite module uses a rule-based rewriting engine, based on a  
PCRE regular-expression parser, to rewrite requested URLs on the fly. By  
default, mod-rewrite maps a URL to a file system path. However, it can also be  
used to redirect one URL to another one, or to invoke an internal proxy fetch.  
Mod\_rewrite provides a flexible and powerful way to manipulate URLs  
using an unlimited number of rules. Each rule can have an unlimited  
number of attached rule conditions, to allow you to rewrite URL based on-  
server variables, environment variables, HTTP headers, or time stamps.  
Mod\_rewrite operates on the full URL path, including the path-info section.  
A rewrite rule can be invoked in httpd.conf or in .htaccess. The path gen-  
erated by a rewrite rule can include a query string, or can lead to internal  
sub-processing, external request redirection, or internal proxy throughput.

What you can do with ISAPI-Rewrite\:  
■ Optimize your dynamic content, like forums or e-stores, to be  
indexed by popular search engines.  
■ Block hot linking of your data files by other sites.  
■ Develop a custom authorization scheme and manage access to the  
static files using custom scripts and database.  
■ Proxy content of one site into a directory on another site.  
■ Make your Intranet servers accessible on the Internet by using only  
one Internet server with very flexible permissions and security options.  
■ Create dynamic host-header based sites using a single physical site.  
■ Create a virtual directory structure of the site hiding physical files  
and extensions. The latter also facilitates switching from one tech-  
nology to another.  
■ Return a browser-dependent content even for static files.  
What’s more, a wide range of other problems could be solved if we take  
advantage of the regular expression engine built into the ISAPI-Rewrite.  
\(Helicon Tech, 2015\)  
Figure 3.5. Description of ISAPI–Rewrite Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 71  
■ Use it in meta tags  
In general, meta tags have to provide search engines with  
information about the content on the website. It is obvious  
from Figure 3.6 that all we can see while searching are meta-  
tags\: meta titles and meta descriptions. That’s the reason to  
give them all due attention. In most cases all a search engine  
will show is the first 155 characters of your meta description,  
so try to fit all you want to say in that space. Provided that  
you are used to the Twitter standard of 140, 155 will be quite  
sufficient.  
In writing a meta title tag your goal should be to fit within 65  
characters. Everything after this number will appear as … You  
can always search for help online. As for meta title tags and  
meta descriptions, you can use SEO tag counting tools. Just do  
a search on those keywords to see how many of the available  
suggestions you will find convenient to use.  
“Words are all I have to take your heart away”  
Now let’s talk a little bit more about words. In May of 1929, General  
Electric and Westinghouse approached Edward L. Bernays with the  
Figure 3.6. How SEO Works in Google Search 72 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
task of handling the 50th anniversary of the first incandescent light, a  
celebration which would honor both Thomas Edison and his invaluable  
invention. Edward L. Bernays spent a lot of time searching for the right  
words to name the event. Today it is known as the Light’s Golden Jubi-  
lee \(http\://www.prmuseum.org/blog/2015/8/24/lights-golden-jubilee\).  
For him even in those days, when search engines didn’t exist, words  
had the same potential to impact on human behavior. Thus, being a  
powerful instrument as well as a starting point on the search box, they  
require our special attention. To get inspiration and a real-time pic-  
ture, visit www.google.com/trends/ where you can see what people all  
over the world are searching for. Furthermore, we can also read Bing  
Blog \(http\://www.bing.com/blogs/\) for information about what people  
there are searching for. That information has to be used as a guideline,  
to avoid copying the most popular terms. In most cases the right key-  
words may not attract a huge number of visitors to your page, yet they  
are bound to involve the right type of potential guests. If you focus on  
people’s needs and what words they will use to find your event, you will  
get the right visitors. Remember that your event is aimed at fulfilling

some need. Think about that need, what words they will use to find a  
solution, focus on those words and explain in the body text why your  
event is the best solution for their problem. To get a good idea of what  
the best keywords for your event are, you can try some of the available  
webmaster tools.  
It is a good idea while searching for the most suitable keywords  
to invest a small amount of money in sample campaign in Google  
Adwords and/or Bing Adcenter. Be very careful and track down the  
impression and conversation rate for those words, which have 2–3000  
clicks. These are bound to be your best keywords.  
A well-known fact about searching is that the most popular words  
make up less than 30% of the searches performed on the web. The  
remaining 70% are related to searches for specific words or a combina-  
tion of words, which are, in fact, a closer and more accurate represen-  
tation of the needs of users. The full story of the “long tail” \(Anderson,  
Figure 3.8. The Search Demand Curve \(Source\: Fishkin, 2009. Used with  
permission.\). 74 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
2006\) is something that has to be read, yet for the purposes of our study,  
it is important to point out that those who search for popular terms are  
not the ones who make purchases. They are just passing down infor-  
mation, while those who know what they need and want are the people  
who search for specific keywords.  
EXPERIENCE ON THE WEBSITE  
No one knows exactly the whole algorithms used by search engines.  
What is certain is that they supply users with the best possible results  
in their aim to meet users’ needs. In doing so, they monitor how people  
interact and engage with your content, collect information, which they  
analyze, and offer the best answers. In order to make your site more  
attractive and useful to users, you have to find the answer to the follow-  
ing questions\:  
■  
Is the website easy to use and understand?  
■ Is the information relevant to what we promise to be?  
■ Is it accessible to modern browsers?  
■ Is the content unique and credible?  
As in real life, people dislike things that make them feel uncom-  
fortable.  
In 2011 Google introduced its Panda algorithm as a way of  
improving the quality of its search results, as well as a convenient  
means of providing users with higher quality content. Since the  
initial launch, Google has implemented lots of updates of vary-  
ing degrees, aimed at perfecting the algorithm to ensure that  
search queries always produce results most likely to satisfy the user.  
In 2012 Google introduces Penguin, a code name for a Google algorithm  
update. The update is aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of web-  
sites that violate Google’s Webmaster Guidelines by using the currently  
declared black-hat SEO techniques involved in increasing artificially the  
ranking of a webpage by manipulating the number of links pointing toMeeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 75  
the page. It is obvious that Google is constantly changing its algorithm to  
guarantee its users the most precise answers and put a stop to all manip-  
ulation. The only thing to be claimed with certainty is that if you have  
useful, unique and relevant content, those changes will not affect you in  
the least.  
Thus, what you should do is consider carefully what the intent of  
the search is, so as to be able to offer the best answer. With regard to  
events, there are a few important points worth mentioning\:  
1\. People want to identify a local event, make a reservation, buy  
tickets, or register online.  
2\. People want to find your event on the web to get information,  
details or to share it.  
3\. People just want to get more information.  
We have to work out our pages in a way to meet those needs step  
by step. We can respond to the needs of our users who, in fact, are our  
guests. We can offer them content in a variety of forms—text, audio,  
pictures, video, and charts—due to the popularity they have gained in  
multimedia communication nowadays. Last but not least, we have to  
make the whole content easy to share.  
Links, links, links  
In brief, link building is the process of establishing relevant, inbound  
links \(incoming links\) to your website, which help the latter achieve a  
higher ranking with the major search engines and drive targeted traffic  
to your site. The successful link-building campaign may not bring you  
fast results. In such a campaign the main goal is not simply to have links  
to your website but to build links from credible sources. Even though  
it is a key element, link building on its own cannot help your site to  
achieve its natural ranking. However, provided that it has become an  
incorporated part of your SEO approach, your site will gain the full  
benefits from links. Here are some suggestions for link building\:76 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
\#1 Include links to and from websites that are popular in a city in  
which the event will take place, such as city guides.  
\#2 Use clickable links in the anchor text, link label, link text, or  
link title, and make the hyperlinks visible. The words con-  
tained in the anchor text can determine the ranking that the  
page will receive by search engines. Not all links have anchor  
texts because it may be obvious where the link will lead, due to  
the context in which it is used. Anchor texts normally remain  
below 60 characters.  
\#3 Choose carefully which websites you need to put links to; the  
more credible the site is, the better it is to have a link to it.  
\#4 Keep your content fresh. Practice proves that links in fresh con-  
tent have a more significant impact on rankings, which means  
we have to aim constantly for links in new content.  
Figure 3.9. Social Media as Factors in SEO Rankings 2015 \(Data from  
SmartInsights\: http\://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisa-  
tion-seo/seo-strategy/seo-correlation-studies/attachment/seo-ranking-fac-  
tors-2015\). Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 77  
\#5 Aim for social shares. Here we can share links on our pages,  
profiles, etc., which may also stimulate users to share with their  
networks.  
Although link building may seem very complicated, actually it is  
not. We can take some small steps to increase the number of links to  
our website. As long as we have created the best content on the topic, we  
will receive natural links from other websites, which strive to make the  
life of their own users easier. Firstly, we have to submit our website to  
directories and include the URL in our signature in every single e-mail  
we send. We can ask bloggers to link to us. In addition, we can create  
links by ourselves when we comment in forums, blogs, and in our user  
profile.  
In planning our link-building strategy we have to work closely  
with our content creators and communication experts. The best way  
to gain links is to create a newsworthy content that people are eager to  
share. First and foremost, we must have the content available to create  
the easiest way for people to share instantly. If there is a person in your  
team who loves writing, creating a blog is a good idea for generating  
links.  
All search engines are constantly trying to detect those who pay for  
links in order to diminish their significance, so it is not reasonable to  
invest money in that practice. On the contrary, invest in creativity and  
resources to create content that people will be willing to share.  
Share this!  
We are all familiar with that button. And we know that when we  
find something interesting, we want to share it with our networks. A  
more advanced way to increase shares is to add social share buttons to  
individual pieces of content on your website or blog. If we look care-  
fully at the results of the research “SEO Ranking Factors—Rank Cor-  
relation 2013 for Google USA” \(Buuteeq + Skift, 2014\), we will find out  
how important social shares are. Of course, we must not forget that the78 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
research has laid its focus on Google, so G+ is on the top. Nevertheless,  
we have to be on the major networks and share links there. Although  
social media and networks will be discussed further in the chapter, it  
is important to point out, even at this stage, that we have to be where  
our potential guests are, impossible as it is to be everywhere at the same  
time. What’s more, we have to be on G+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest,  
Youtube, and Flickr at least. The wider scope of our video content will  
enhance the potential and impact of our page rank.  
We would like to draw your attention to a few guidelines for better  
social media presence in terms of SEO.  
\#1 Step. Optimize your profile in social media  
Take advantage of any opportunity to write about your event, which  
means you need to fill in the “About” or “Information” sections of any  
social media platform. Use your keywords and phrases because they  
describe your event precisely. Moreover, they are also terms individu-  
als would use to search for your event. Think globally but act locally.  
Although you may have heard this advice frequently, have you actually  
followed it? You should not forget to show your address, city, state and  
zip on your event page on Facebook. Always include links from your  
social channels back to your business’s website \(and links from your  
website to your social channels\).  
\#2 Step. Optimize your social media content/updates  
This means you should use your keywords once more in your posts,  
updates, and descriptions of photos and videos. Share all new content  
from your event website in all social channels. Sharing new content  
on Twitter is especially important because it helps Google to add your  
URL to its database. One more tip\: It will help if you use your business’s  
name in your social posts. In that way Google can easily associate the  
keywords you use with your business’s name.Meeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 79  
\#3 Step. Optimize the opportunity to share  
Shareability is all about what the post does to people\: it affects them  
in such a way that they want to share with others. +1s, likes, repins,  
retweets, comments, etc., all improve the reliability of your links. The  
more share you get, the more inbound links are created. People share  
not only written content; it is just the opposite. “Content” doesn’t  
always have to be as elaborate as a blog post or whitepaper; content  
can also refer to tweets or Facebook posts as well. By posting engaging  
social content, you’re improving your SEO value. To review\: Quality  
content leads to more shares, which is equivalent to more links, and  
they result in a higher SEO value. Simple, isn’t it? In their study, “The  
Psychology of Sharing,” The New York Times Insight Group \(Brett,  
2014\) found that\:  
■  
75% of the respondents say sharing helps them understand bet-  
ter and process news they’re interested in  
■ 85% claim that the responses they get from posting and sharing  
on a social media site are an important source of thought  
■ 94% consider how helpful a link would be to another user  
before posting it  
■ 68% see sharing as a way to promote themselves and as a means  
to give other people a better idea of who they really are  
■ 73% say it helps them find people with common interests \(Brett,  
2014\)  
If social media and sharing is important to your event, you have to  
plan carefully your social content, keeping in mind why people share,  
give +1, retweet, etc.  
If we do a thorough research into the type of content people share  
most often, we can come up with the top seven functions of highly  
shared post. Highly shareable posts do at least one of the following\:80 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
1\. GIVE\: Offers, discounts, deals or contests that everyone can  
benefit from, not just one sub-group of your friends.  
2\. ADVISE\: Tips, especially about problems that everyone  
encounters; for example, how to get a job or how to beat the flu.  
3\. WARN\: Warnings about dangers that could affect anyone.  
4\. AMUSE\: Funny pictures and quotes, as long as they’re not offen-  
sive to any group. Sometimes humor may not be quite as strong  
or edgy, it still has to appeal to a general audience.  
5\. INSPIRE\: Inspirational quotes.  
6\. AMAZE\: Amazing pictures or facts.  
7\. UNITE\: A post that acts as a flag to carry and a way to brag to  
others about your membership in a group that’s doing pretty  
darned good, thank you very much. \(Carter and Marketto.com,  
2014\)  
\#4 Step. Share visuals  
Pinterest is a great tool for link building and improving the keyword  
strategy for your event. When possible it is a good idea to use high-qual-  
ity images on Pinterest, as Google prefers high-resolution images. Goo-  
gle indexes pages from websites with heavy traffic faster and higher.  
What’s more, Pinterest is just one of those pages that you can add a  
link on to. However, do not forget to add keywords within the title of a  
Pinterest board and the board’s description.  
As a bonus you have up to 500 characters to describe an individual  
pin connected with your event. And here again you have to use your  
keywords. From an SEO perspective, Pinterest allows you to do a few  
things that other networks don’t, so take advantage of it.  
\#5 Step. Spend time in Google+ every day  
As Google is the number one search engine, we have to take into con-  
sideration its preferences. Sign up for a Google+ Business Page. Fill inMeeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 81  
as many fields as you can in the “About” section. Do not forget to use  
your keywords and phrases to describe your event. Google allows you  
to add customized links to your profile. Use this opportunity to link  
back to your website, blog, and additional social channels. Share all  
your new content with your Google+ page, which will increase your  
chances to appear within Google’s SERP. If you are doing your event on  
a regular basis, your presence on the local listing is obligatory. Accord-  
ing to Google, 97% of the consumers search for local businesses online.  
Google Places for Business gives you access to free tools that help your  
business get online, or to be found on Google Search and Maps, and get  
closer to your customers. It’s the easiest way to manage your business  
across Google and it’s free.  
As social media and networks are quite new to all of us, we can—  
and do—make mistakes. However, the good news is that most of them  
can easily be corrected. So, if you have done a Facebook profile for your  
event, instead of Facebook Page, you can fix it \(Lucey, 2014\). If you  
have not added a customized Facebook URL, you can fix it \(Pinkham,  
2014\). Check the name of all files you upload—text, pictures, and vid-  
eos. Those names can be part of your SEO, so use keywords and/or  
phrases in their names \(Secure a Vanity URL, 2014\).  
MEASURING  
One of the greatest benefits of new technologies is that they give us  
unlimited opportunities for measuring what used to be immeasurable  
in the past. You can use the analytic data that is most convenient to  
your event’s needs. In its review about 2014 Web Analytics Product  
Comparisons, Brian Lee says that, “Your customer has an itch, and your  
website needs to be able to scratch that itch. Knowing exactly how to do  
that is the key to getting visitors to take action on your site. You can use  
information gathered from web analytics to maximize revenues from  
pay-per-click advertising, improve click-through on email campaigns,  
or even increase your search engine ranking. The possibilities are end-  
less” \(Lee, 2014\). There are free tools for measuring, which give you  
an accurate picture of what is happening and you have to find out why82 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
this is so. You can start by creating Google Alerts for all important key-  
words and phrases for your event. In fact, Google has a lot of tools, and  
most of them are free or have a free version\: They include\:  
Google Alerts  
Google Analytics  
Google Insights for Search  
Google Webmaster Tools  
Google AdWords Keyword Tool  
Google Trends  
Google website Optimizer  
DoubleClick Ad Planner  
Google Page Speed  
Merchant Center  
Google Site Map  
Google+  
You can use tools from Yahoo!, such as Yahoo Web Analytics and  
Advertising Insights. It is important to point out that whatever can be  
measured can be improved. The focus lies on technologies and on the  
tools they offer us, yet there is a human being in front of every single  
computer. As humans, we tend to behave in the same way as we used  
to hundreds of years ago, which makes the following advice for better  
SEO by the “Father of Public Relations” quite relevant. The campaigns  
of Edward L. Bernays are still an example for those who want to change  
public opinion toward a cause, product, or event. Working long before  
the invention of the Internet, he had used some principles which can be  
applied to SEO even today. The essential lessons that Bernays teaches  
about link building can be summarized as follows\:  
Influencing the influencers. This means finding online influenc-  
ers on the topic of the events and creating personal relationships withMeeting and Event Search Engine Optimization ² 83  
them. What is even more important is creating content, significant to  
them, which they will be willing to share with their networks. Those  
influencers have networks of followers who trust them, and that’s the  
best way to spread information in our network society.  
Help people express themselves by linking to you. The best way to  
do this is to make your content \(event\) a tool of self-expression. It is by  
far our greatest advantage that with the help of new technologies and a  
dose of creativity it’s easy for people to express themselves by linking to  
our event. Walking in our potential guests’ shoes, we can create numer-  
ous opportunities to offer them content—high quality, relevant, person-  
alized, and delivered in context. PicBadges \(www.picbadges.com\) is just  
one among a bulk of possibilities at our disposal. It is a meteoric social  
platform, which offers people and businesses an engaging and viral way  
to reach their audience by creating and sharing ideas, activities, events,  
and interests on top of profile pictures on Facebook and Twitter. How-  
ever, there are virtually no limits to the process of creation of different  
platforms as well as other ways to engage guests as early as possible.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Before coming to any conclusion about your SEO plans, try walking in  
the shoes of your guests. Try to learn as much as possible about them  
and what they will need. After that you have to focus on finding the  
best keywords and phrases for your event. Try to find out whether  
they work with either friends or friends of your friends. When you are  
ready, integrate those keywords on all possible occasions and start put-  
ting effort in creating the most relevant content for your event, which  
deserves to be shared.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. How do you make up your list of keywords and phrases?  
2\. How do you decide where to focus your link-building strategy?  
3\. How do you improve the shareability of your posts in social  
media?84 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
TASK  
Create a post for your profile on any social media, following the advice  
in this chapter. Note how people react to your posts. Share if there are  
differences in people’s reaction on different social media platforms.

As a result of reading this chapter, you will learn how to\:  
■ Access an accurate and up-to-date global database of meeting  
and event venues  
■ Streamline site selection and sourcing process  
■ Research destinations, and find and compare meeting  
facilities faster and more easily than relying on traditional  
search engines  
■  
Search venues and send request for proposals \(RFPs\)  
■ Source meeting space with ease and effectively use online  
venue search services  
87 88 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
INTRODUCTION  
Choosing a meeting/event venue is one of the most delicate decisions  
that event professionals face. A venue search was traditionally done in  
person—often known as MBWA \(management by walking around\), as  
being on site for the search used to be known as the best and only way.  
However, due to rising fuel costs and costs associated with staff time  
\(planning, traveling, and attending\), accommodation, and meals, the  
demand for an economical but effective venue/supplier search method  
has increased. An exponential increase in hardware capabilities is driv-  
ing progress in all domains of IT and computing in meeting and event  
management.  
Systems are more powerful than before and can share more infor-  
mation digitally. Also, advances in computers, CPUs \(central pro-  
cessing units\), and Internet broadband along with more information  
\(video, image\) of meeting venues are now easily shared via online  
sources \(website, social networking sites \[SNSs\]\).  
ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING  
Most companies in today’s event and meeting business are constantly  
strategizing and finding new ways to streamline operations to gain a  
competitive advantage. More and more event/meeting organizations are  
now using technology for their meetings and events, and the motivation  
usually comes down to “will it make a big enough difference?”  
An industry-specific search engine database is a breakthrough for  
the meeting and event industry as it integrates technology with tradi-  
tional event management tools to create more effective meeting/event  
planning. Today’s meeting and event management experts rate demo-  
graphics as one of the most significant challenges for event planners  
and suppliers. With a wide variety of pre-boomers, baby boomers,  
and Generations X, Y and Z, as well as a variety of cultural back-  
grounds, satisfying everyone is impossible. Event and meeting pro-  
fessionals are coping with demographic diversity by providing moreVenue and Suppliers Search Technology ² 89  
options in technology, scheduling, meeting spaces, and even food and  
beverage choices.  
Meeting Professionals International \(MPI\) \(2014\) found sev-  
eral changes in venue selection as well. Most notably, public percep-  
tion—once a key factor in picking a city—has become one of the least  
considered elements for selecting an event destination. Just 14 per-  
cent of respondents say it plays into their thought process, while 42  
percent name overall cost as the most important factor. In addition a  
strong move toward green \(or environmentally sustainable\) meetings  
is another force influencing event management, including venue and  
supplier search procedures. Excessive use of paper can be eliminated by  
utilizing an event management service such as venue/supplier search  
technology to communicate with venues. Site search software can be  
used for all facets of event management.  
Other technologies that support green meetings include technolo-  
gies that allow for stability and ease of business operations, for cost sav-  
ings, for reduction of the carbon footprint, for adding value for clients,  
for innovation, for competitive advantage, and for staff motivation.  
The computer integrated system \(CIS\) is the integration of multiple  
programs/applications to achieve a streamlined process of information  
and increased productivity as well as for reducing a redundancy of data  
and avoiding multiple entries of the same data.  
INTERNET  
Online communication and information dissemination over the Inter-  
net have significantly impacted the organization of meetings and  
business in general, all of which is made possible by the widespread  
availability of high-speed online access \(initially ISDN \[integrated ser-  
vices digital networks\] and later fiber-optic cables\).  
The annual growth of broadband is between one percent and two  
percent for most countries, which will lead to even wider availability in90 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
the future. Fiber-optic cables, which have mostly been used for Internet  
backbone networks, are increasingly also used by private customers.  
In other words, Internet bandwidth will continue to grow, with con-  
sequences for many of the technologies relevant for meetings; video  
and multimedia will be more accessible and practical, enabling more  
effective forms of technology-based venue/suppliers search. Increas-  
ingly, the Internet has served as the backbone for a faster and media  
rich online venue search.  
While improved Internet access was the most or second most  
demanded technology by both planners and suppliers, it was rated the  
10th most difficult demand to meet by planners and the eighth most  
difficult by suppliers—representing one of the largest discrepancies  
between supply and demand.  
In 2010, the penetration of broadband connection for businesses  
in 30 countries was more than 75 percent, and even in private house-  
holds, many countries had a broadband penetration of between 60 per-  
cent and 80 percent, topped by Korea at 98 percent, according to data  
from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  
\(OECD, 2011\).  
Despite the conveniences of forgoing in-person site visits, the  
online venue search is still daunting, labor-intense work. For exam-  
ple, if an inexperienced event planner searches using general search  
engines \(e.g. Google, Yahoo\) for his event venue, it will surely over-  
whelm him. Further, if the search involves an unfamiliar destination,  
the challenge will be even bigger. One of the strongest focuses of  
technology providers over the past years revolved around facilitat-  
ing this change. Venue search engines have popped up all over the  
place. Websites where event planners looked for a new destination  
or venue could find considerable information about potential can-  
didates. Some companies automated the request for proposal \(RFP\)  
process. With the RFP, planners collectively prompted venue owners  
to reply to their demands. Undoubtedly this is one of the hottest areasVenue and Suppliers Search Technology ² 91  
of technology where innovation could result in multi-million dollar  
revenues.  
BENEFITS OF VENUE AND SUPPLIER SEARCH  
TECHNOLOGY  
Search technology, such as Cvent Supplier Network, can let meeting/  
event planners source, manage, and budget events using a single toolset.  
By storing key contacts, supplier notes, quote history, and other detailed  
reports in the same system, search technology makes the event planning  
process more efficient and transparent. The tool also manages cancelled  
space, preferred suppliers, and negotiated rates, and allows planners to  
find venues near precise locations with interactive maps. Some functions  
of this technology estimates capacities and converts between standard  
and metric units.  
Easier site selection  
Online venue search technology allows for the search of tens of thou-  
sands of hotels globally for meeting services from a single location.  
Event planners can quickly view property details and room specifica-  
tions as well as surrounding attractions.  
Easy and efficient RFP management  
The RFP can save time by using established digital templates \(eRFP\).  
The eRFP allows meeting planners to send a request to multiple prop-  
erties with one click. It also permits users to add a new venue or dese-  
lect an existing venue from the initial eRFP. The eRFP tool allows easy  
and quick comparisons of proposals from hotels side by side, allowing  
planners to gauge the most competitive bids simultaneously.  
Contract management  
This technology enhances efficiency in contract management by  
viewing details of contract rate history with a hotel, which allows for92 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
benchmarking against previously negotiated rates. It also allows an  
event organization to use established terms and conditions to existing  
eRFPs to prevent unwanted attrition fees.  
For venues and suppliers  
Venue staff can easily review, manage, and respond to eRFPs. An indus-  
try report says that this technology can respond up to 70% faster than  
before. It also saves time by reviewing all RFPs via a single page. Finally,  
it stores some pre-generated RFP context and answers that can save  
time to respond, which allows sales staff to spend more time evaluat-  
ing RFPs for fast and accurate replies in order to win a bid. Table 4.1  
provides a brief summary of advantages of online venue and supplier  
search applications for event organizations.

Venue and supplier search technology process  
A typical meeting/event venue and supplier search can follow various  
routes but can be summarized as follows\:  
Step1\: Search  
■ Enter the area you want to search, and the technology provides  
a list of venues in that area immediately.  
■ Filter the local venues to find the room perfect for your func-  
tion. Find event space based on relevant meeting criteria such  
as metro area, venue or service type, and total meeting space or  
chain affiliation.  
Step 2\: Creating RPFs  
■ Creating a request for proposal \(RFP\) is simple with technol-  
ogy that is easy to follow and provides guides and time-saving  
features.94 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 4.1. Diagram Digital Venue Search vs. Traditional Venue Search  
Process Venue and Suppliers Search Technology ² 95  
■ Once planner and organization information is uploaded one  
time, future forms are pre-populated from existing account  
profile information  
■ Copy previous RFPs to eliminate data re-entry  
■ Attach key documents to the RFP  
Step 3\: Sending RFPs  
■ Select the venues that you want to send an inquiry to and the  
system will forward your details  
■ Save time by submitting RFPs directly to multiple venues at  
once, the National Sales Office, or both, enter in some contact  
details and any other quick details that will help with the venue  
response  
 Step 4\: Receive bids and compare quotes from venues and service  
providers  
■ Compare bids side by side and select the best venues and ser-  
vice providers for your next event.  
■ Review multiple quotes side by side to analyze details such as  
availability, cost and meeting space.  
■ Notify suppliers of your decision to accept or decline their  
proposal

Connect+ at Hilton Worldwide  
The Hilton created Connect+, a dynamic collection of more than 100  
of its largest hotels combined with their planning and event expertise  
and support. Every hotel in the Connect+ collection is in a destina-  
tion city, with large-scale features including approximately 450+ rooms  
or 40,000 sq. ft. or more of meeting space. It believes in the power of  
bringing people together to share, engage, and connect for memorable  
events at exceptional destinations. Connect+ delivers results—return  
on investment in the form of both value and the valued connections  
that only face-to-face experiences can provide.  
Further, virtual reality and 3D views of venues are easily accessible  
by a personal computer. These virtual site visits have drastically helped  
meeting/event planners save time during the initial stage of their search  
for a venue. Event venues’ website contains image of the venue, decora-  
tions, and food and beverage options/price/photos. Thanks to advances  
in hardware and ICT \(information and communications technology\),  
now many event venues provide 365 degree panoramic views or vir-  
tual walk-throughs of the venue using virtual reality \(VR\) technology.  
Virtual reality has been a domain of mostly technical simulation. With  
immersion, 3D graphics and sound, the user experience simulates  
aspects of reality.98 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
For meetings, virtual reality can replicate parts of an actual meeting  
venue and simulate interactions that are customary at face-to-face site  
inspections. Simulating meeting spaces online through graphic illusion  
simulates the face-to-face experience. Figure 4.3 shows an example  
from Hilton Chicago.

CIC APEX and Venue Selection/RFP Standardization  
The meetings and events industry was realizing the need for stan-  
dardization of processes due to the rapid developments in technol-  
ogy. In 2000 the CIC \(Convention Industry Council\) established a  
committee to develop accepted practices for the meetings and events Venue and Suppliers Search Technology ² 99  
industry. This committee developed the Accepted Practices Exchange  
\(APEX\) that has been responsible for developing standardized forms  
and, most recently, standard reporting practices.  
The benefits of implementing industry-wide accepted practices include\:  
•  
Time and cost savings  
•  
Ease of communication and sharing of data  
•  
Streamlined systems and processes  
•  
Enhanced professionalism  
•  
Superior results  
APEX developed the standard venue/destination checklist that is widely  
used by many meeting event planners and venues to create their RFPs.

removing as much unnecessary or duplicative information  
as possible and providing simple, drop-down menus and  
auto-populating fields where possible.  
Benefits of new APEX RFP Workbook for all meeting professionals\:  
n Save time by reducing retyping of basic event information  
n Quickly create RFPs using drop-down menus and auto-  
matic calculations  
n Produce clean, professional documents  
n Stay organized with all major RFPs in one place  
2\. CIC APEX meeting and site profiles initiatives  
The purpose of the initiatives were to develop recommended  
industry accepted practices for consistent and thorough pro-  
file formats for sites, as well as meetings, conventions, and other  
events, that include both core and unique information. After a  
great deal of research and discussion it was decided that the APEX  
meeting profile portion of the document is better suited to be con-  
tained within the request for proposals \(RFPs\) Panel rather than  
as a stand-alone panel \(Convention Industry Council, 2014\).  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
The meeting/event venue and supplier search technology is a combi-  
nation of WWW, Wi-Fi, and cloud technology in the Meetings and  
Events Technology Golden Triangle.  
The meetings and events industry has experienced dramatic change.  
Venue and supplier search technology provides the details meetings  
and event professionals need to compare venues and suppliers, helping  
planners to identify the optimal location or suppliers providing ser-  
vices for their next event. An exponential increase in hardware capabil-  
ities is driving progress in all domains of IT and computing in meetingVenue and Suppliers Search Technology ² 101

LEARNING OUTCOMES  
As a result of reading this chapter, you will learn how to\:  
■ Apply event and meeting floor design technology  
■ Evaluate available meeting and event design technology  
■ Apply event and meeting floor plans for better attendee service  
before/during/after an event or meeting  
■ Forecast future trends in event and meeting design technology  
INTRODUCTION  
Today’s event and meeting venues are getting larger and more tech-  
nologically advanced. Their layout is not only getting efficient but also  
consistently being renovated to accommodate various requests from  
105 106 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
planners and attendees. For example Walter E. Washington Convention  
Center, opened in 2003 in Washington, DC, has 2.3 million-square-foot  
space of all sizes, from space for small groups and break-out meetings  
to events for 500 to 42,000 attendees. It includes a range of mixed-use  
exhibit spaces, 198,000 square feet of flexible meeting space with a total  
of 77 break-out rooms. Imagine you are the event planner at this venue  
and design all necessary logistics for keynote sessions, breakout ses-  
sions, an exhibition, an award banquet, a rooftop reception. There are  
many factors to consider for a layout of event/meeting room assign-  
ments, including room set-up, number of expected attendees, topics  
of session, time that it takes to go from one meeting room to another  
meeting room, number of doors to enter/exit, and so on. Planning  
for all this will certainly entail a tremendous amount of work and will  
require support from professional floor diagram design professionals  
and technology.  
Not long ago, an official event floor diagram was drawn by a com-  
puter-aided design \(CAD\) specialist. CAD is very useful to create a  
professional scaled floor plan. It is a hard-copy-based professionally  
drawn blueprint or an electronic file that can only be accessed or mod-  
ified using CAD software. A sample of a hard-copy blueprint printer  
can be seen in the Figure 5.1 below. As details of an event often can  
be changed until the day of event, consequent changes on the floor  
diagram had to be made via multiple back and forth communications  
between an event planner and the CAD professional. Unfortunately  
event/meeting/tradeshow planners were not able to do any revisions on  
their own for every need as it required the high-priced CAD software, a  
plot printer, and most of all, special expertise in CAD operation. There-  
fore any minor ad hoc changes or urgent needs of changes in the event  
floor often had to bypass the CAD company and were communicated  
using verbal or a non-scaled brief drawings of floor plans. Most of all,  
changes in exhibitor booth or session changes made on a master blue-  
print were not automatically updated to those who share a copied floor  
plan. It had to be done via multiple phone calls or e-mails to inform any  
changes made on the master blueprint.Meeting and Event Design Technology ² 107  
Figure 5.1. CAD Software Drawn Floor Plan on Printer  
One of the top trends that has impacted the meetings and events  
industry is a greater utilization of technology, and new technology-based  
event floor design software came to the meeting/event market. These  
programs let event/meeting planners use pre-installed extensive interac-  
tive venue diagrams for easy drawing or for creating an original diagram  
if a venue is not in the database. As these diagrams are electronic files, it  
is easy for planners to create as many diagrams as needed for clients and  
to communicate with key event staff \(e.g. venues’ banquets and catering  
staff\). It is also capable of rendering a 3D event diagram and printing,  
saving and sending it via e-mail to anyone who needs the diagram.  
These event diagram design software programs are easy to use to  
create professional looking diagrams without extensive CAD training.  
These programs are personal computer-based and adopt user-friendly  
graphic interface applications, which means all operations are easy to  
see and perform, with most of functions using a simple click, drag, and  
place system. For an example of graphic user interface-based event dia-  
gram design software, see Figure 5.2.108 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 5.2. Pre-Designed Icons and a Sample Event Diagram \(Source\: MeetingMatrix, 2015; used with permission\). Meeting and Event Design Technology ² 109  
More and more event diagram design applications are going online  
so event/meeting planners and key stakeholders have full access to these  
software packages and diagrams as long as they have Internet access.  
As cloud computing becomes a standard in many IT systems, software  
does not need to be installed on computers but can be accessed by  
everyone involved via cloud computing, which is the practice of using  
a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage,  
and process data.  
Virtual reality venue tour \(3D\)  
There are companies that offer 3D virtual reality that can create photo  
realistic tours from blueprints and interior design specifications. As a  
result of these programs the event venue sales professionals are able to  
show current and prospective clients exactly what their venue would  
look like when an event is hosted.  
BENEFITS OF EVENT AND MEETING FLOOR DESIGN  
SOFTWARE  
1\. For planners\:  
Event floor diagram software can facilitate better event plan-  
ning coordination. Planners can e-mail event set-up diagrams  
directly to their clients for effective discussion on set-up and  
specifications. Planners also can print out diagrams to share  
with key stakeholders. Professionally drawn and scaled dia-  
grams are shared with venues for accurate room layout as these  
diagrams reduce guesswork and unnecessary back and forth  
communications between planners and venues. When imple-  
menting event diagram design, technology can shorten the  
planning process.  
More and more event/trade show and meeting planners suc-  
cessfully create, manage, and market their events on diagram  
design tools on platforms that range from the desktop to the  
Internet to mobile devices.110 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Online-based event floor diagram design tools are used by most  
show organizers and general service contractors in the today’s  
event world. These products include exclusively designed ver-  
sions for general service contractors \(e.g. GES, Freeman, etc.\)  
and professional event/meeting/trade show organizers in the  
trade, corporate, consumers, and festivals and fairs industries.  
What is the most impressive about today’s diagram design tools  
is that they can be seamlessly integrated with dimensionally  
accurate and rich revenue creating features.  
2\. For event and meeting venues\:  
Event diagram tools allow meeting/event venues to market and  
sell their event space online in a dynamic and engaging way.  
They provide a virtual tour of venues that their sales team can  
use onsite or remotely to engage and close event business. It’s an  
online interactive experience that event planners use to discover  
a venue’s capabilities. Venues can showcase their properties in

MAJOR EVENT/TRADE SHOW DIAGRAM DESIGN  
SOFTWARE  
1\. EXPOCAD  
EXPOCAD was the first graphical exposition management \(GEM\)  
software that was created specifically for show management and  
operations teams in 1999. It implemented the very first, real-  
time, Internet-based trade show floor design. It enables event/  
meeting/trade show managers immediate access and total con-  
trol over inside and outside exposition space and offers the abil-  
ity to share the floor plan with all staff from the first contact  
to the final invoice. It enhances streamlining of management  
of events by its automation and by maintaining all exhibitor  
content. Once floor plans are designed and approved by the  
general service contractor, sales or operations teams start sales  
activities by renting, un-renting, modifying, and reorganizing  
the floor plan space to reflect any changes. This type of online-  
based real-time trade show floor diagram design software allow  
the organizers to sell exhibition booths either live on-site or live  
online with accurate real time inventories.  
Today over \$1 billion \(USD\) of exhibition floor is managed  
by EXPOCAD annually \(EXPOCAD, 2015\). 80% of US based112 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
expos are designed using EXPOCAD software. EXPOCAD is  
used by major show contractors including Freeman Compa-  
nies \(global\), Global Exposition Specialists \(global\), The Expo  
Group, Hargrove, and so on. Figure 5.3 shows several screens

NEW TRENDS\: MOBILE-BASED EVENT DESIGN  
DIAGRAM APPLICATION  
As many meeting/event technologies are shifted to cloud- and mobile-  
device-based applications, event diagram software are also developed  
for mobile devices. Mobile event diagram apps let meeting/event plan-  
ners easily and dynamically review venues on mobile devices \(e.g,  
iPhone or iPad\). These mobile apps provide interactive floor diagrams  
so planners can evaluate and preview event spaces and other features  
of the venue via easy-to-carry mobile devices. PlanView.mobile™ is  
an iPhone application that gives meeting planners and guests mobile  
access to venue floor plans and room diagrams. It allows easy, instant  
access to a venue to planners with an iPhone.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Creating easy and accurate event and meeting floor design was what  
meeting/event/trade show planners sought to help them execute effec-  
tive meeting and event logistics design and boost exhibition sales by  
accessing real-time inventory. Today’s meeting/event design tools areMeeting and Event Design Technology ² 117  
operated at the personal computer level and designed with user-friendly  
graphic interface applications so meeting/event planners can operate  
them easily with a basic skill set. Today, these tools are moving to a  
cloud-based mobile application format, which provides meeting/event  
planners mobility on top of easy and up-to-date event diagram sharing.

INTRODUCTION  
In most cases when we choose a carrier in the field of events, we dream  
about the creative part of the work, not about the administrative duties  
119 120 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
surrounding each project. In fact it is impossible to organize an event  
without administrative work. We are happy to live in times when tech-  
nology can make that administrative much easier, faster, and, thus, more  
enjoyable. This type of work can also be creative.  
In short the main goal of administration is to organize people and other  
resources efficiently and to direct activities toward common goals and  
objectives. If we go back in time, we can find that the word administra-  
tion is derived from the Middle English word administracioun, which  
came from the French administration, itself derived from the Latin  
administratio—a compounding of ad \(“to”\) and ministrare \(“give ser-  
vice”\). Hence, administration is “to give service”. If we have that mean-  
ing in mind, we can accept that giving services can be a fascinating job  
and full of great ideas and challenging tasks.  
According to The International Dictionary of Event Management,  
administration is “the group that determines budget, staffing required  
\(organization chart\), and flow of communications, as well as develops  
the timetable and production schedule for and event” \(Goldblatt and  
Nelson, 2001\).  
As you see, good administration is an integral part of any event.  
Planning the event would be much more difficult and create more pres-  
sure without good administration. The team or the person responsible  
for the event administration, in fact, supports the planning process,  
helps in the implementation of the event, and assists in the evalua-  
tion of the event. It is not exaggerated to say that the administration of  
events plays a pivotal role in the success or failure of any event today.  
Of course, not each event team has the chance to have a dedicated  
event administrator with special skills and knowledge of the specific  
field. But we have to keep in mind that that role is pivotal and should  
be executed by a professional. It is very common to see the use of event  
administration and event management as synonyms. In fact they are  
not. We have to know that there are significant differences between the  
duties of both functions. As event management is the clearer one, weMeeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 121  
Figure 6.1. The Duties of the Event Administrator  
will focus here on the event administration. The event administrator  
has to support the event from the beginning of the planning process  
by keeping documentation and tasks in perfect condition. Nowadays  
the event administrator needs a combination of administrative and IT  
skills to successfully complete tasks. We all know that each event entails  
a huge amount of documentation, which is in fact the history of the  
event. The event administrator is the person responsible for the task  
and at the same time she or he has to be able to conduct research, iden-  
tify necessities, and keep in contact with vendors. Figure 6.1 shows the  
duties of the event administrator.  
As you see the event administrator has many duties, and they are very  
different. This role is very important if we want to a produce great event.  
DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
Data is one of the most important assets a business has, but the rapid  
growth of data can make it increasingly difficult to manage. Today’s  
business administrator handles a large amount data; therefore, effec-  
tive and accurate data management is a critical part of great adminis-  
tration work. The converging trends of big data, modern apps, cloud,  
and bring-your-own-device \(BYOD\) represent challenges to many122 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
meeting/event organizations. It’s clear that more efficiency and tighter  
automation of data management are needed for meeting/event admin-  
istration to move forward.  
Previously most data-documents were created in a hard copy and  
stored in filing cabinets. To access the data, an event administrator had  
to access them physically and make updates on the hard copy. Later,  
personal computers were adopted in event business administration,  
and data were stored in electronic format \(e.g. MS Word, Excel, etc.\).  
While it provided professional and accurate data management at a per-  
sonal level, there were growing issues in company-level data manage-  
ment. For example there are multiple files that include common fields,  
but updating the information in one file system did not automatically  
update the same field in other files that were managed by other staff or  
departments.  
The following section discusses the disadvantages of the old data-  
base management system, known as a traditional file system, and solu-  
tions to those problems with a contemporary file system \(enterprise  
system\).  
Problems of traditional database management system include\:  
1\. Data redundancy and inconsistency\: Data redundancy is the  
presence of duplicate data in multiple data files so that the  
same data are stored in more than one place or location. Data  
inconsistency occurs when the same attribute may have differ-  
ent values.  
2\. Program-data dependence\: The coupling of data stored in files  
and the specific programs required updating and maintaining  
those files such that changes in programs require changes to the  
data.  
3\. Lack of flexibility\: The traditional system cannot deliver ad hoc  
reports or respond to unanticipated information requirements  
in a timely fashion.Meeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 123  
Figure 6.2. Traditional Information System of an Event Organization  
\(Source\: Rainer, Watson, and Prince, 2013\)  
4\. Poor security\: Because there is little control or management of  
data, management will have NO knowledge of who is accessing  
or even making changes to the organization’s data.  
5\. Lack of data sharing and availability\: Information cannot flow  
freely across different functional areas or different parts of the  
organization. Users find different values for the same piece of  
information in different systems, and hence they may not use these  
systems because they cannot trust the accuracy of the data. Figure  
6.2 illustrates a traditional system with these issues.  
Solution\: A contemporary file system \(enterprise database manage-  
ment system\)  
A contemporary file management system was developed to address  
the before-mentioned issues with the traditional system. Software now  
permits firms to centralize data, manage the data efficiently, and pro-  
vide access to the stored data by an application program. It also acts as  
an interface between different application programs and physical data  
files As a result contemporary file management systems solve many  
problems encountered with the traditional data file approach.124 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 6.3. Contemporary Information System of Event Organization  
Contemporary data management systems have following advan-  
tages\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. More uniform organization\: Similar processes and information  
structure will improve administration management among  
various event meeting staff and suppliers.  
More efficient operations\: Contemporary file management can  
support efficient meeting/event administration by integration  
of multiple file management systems.  
Customer-driven business processes\: A contemporary system  
allows meeting/event administration system to connect cus-  
tomer input resulting in better meeting/event customer service.  
Unified platform\: The contemporary system used unified tech-  
nology for various meeting/event administration systems.  
The DBMS \(database management systems\) solved many headaches  
of event administration work-related data management; however, as data  
grows, it requires more space to save those electronic data, typically a server  
to save data. Servers require hardware, space to install them, and skilled IT  
professionals to manage them. Many meeting/event management firms  
are small businesses with limited staff and no designated IT specialist onMeeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 125  
hand most of time. Therefore the new wave of technology to change the  
game of database management has arrived to most business sectors, which  
is cloud computing.  
ADMINISTRATION IN THE CLOUD  
What Is Cloud?  
The idea of cloud computing is surprisingly not new; it was first  
launched in 2000. Oracle’s Larry Ellison launched the New Internet  
Computer \(NIC\) company to lead the industry forward to that goal.  
His concept was simple\: the required equipment is simply a personal  
computer with just a processor, a keyboard, and a monitor. The com-  
puter does not require a hard drive or a CD/DVD player. The com-  
puter connects via the Internet to a remote supercomputer, which  
would host all necessary programs and files. The idea, however, was  
too advanced at the time, and there was a shortage of fast broadband  
in the U.S. back then. As a result the NIC closed in 2003.  
Many business organizations try their best to make sure all of their  
administrative employees have the right hardware and software they  
need to do their jobs. This includes not only hardware \(computer\) but  
also software to give employees the tools they need. Cloud computing  
is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby  
shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers  
and other devices as a utility \(like the electricity grid\) over a network  
\(typically the Internet\). Instead of installing software for each com-  
puter, one application allows workers to log into a web-based service  
that hosts all the programs the employees need to perform their jobs.  
The needed software is stored in remote machines owned by a com-  
pany that runs needed software and data-management programs. With  
the fast advancement of faster Internet with broadband at work and  
at home, cloud computing has grown in popularity. Cloud computing  
eliminates installing software on the computer of each employee. This  
decreases demand for hardware and software on the end user’s level.  
As long as an end user has interface software \(often a web browser126 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
with Internet access\) to access the cloud computing system, he/she can  
access the system that is managed by a remote company with 24/7 tech-  
nical maintenance from anywhere as long as there is Internet access.  
CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS  
Microsoft Cloud Services  
Microsoft delivers the broadest array and depth of cloud computing  
solutions to businesses. Its key areas are  
■ Cloud computing platform\: It provides a unified platform, which  
is called Microsoft Azure, which allows an open and flexible cloud  
computing platform that enables users to quickly build applica-  
tions using any language, tool, or framework, and to deploy and  
manage apps across a global network of Microsoft-managed data  
centers. Figure 6.4 shows Microsoft’s cloud system.  
■ Cloud computing productivity suite\: Office 365 offers produc-  
tivity experience, spanning business intelligence, unified com-  
munications, e-mail, collaboration, and social capabilities.  
■ A private cloud solution\: A suite of business solutions, Micro-  
soft Dynamics helps organizations grow while managing costs.  
Figure 6.4. MS Cloud Meeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 127  
Google Cloud Services  
If you have a Google account, which is nearly a must in today’s online  
environment, you are certainly familiar with Google Cloud \(https\://  
cloud.google.com/\). Google Cloud Platform is a portfolio of cloud  
computing products by Google, which is offering hosting on the same  
supporting infrastructure that Google uses internally for end-user  
products like Google Search and Youtube. One of the unique benefits is  
that when using Google Cloud, you have access to other Google infra-  
structures. As with all others cloud services, Google cloud offers the  
following benefits\:  
■ Secure and safe\: Your data is protected through redundant stor-  
age at multiple physical locations.  
■ Flexible access.  
■ Competitive and flexible pricing\: You pay for only for what you  
use.  
One feature that can be very useful for event administrators is Goo-  
gle Cloud Print. This is a new technology that connects your printers to  
the web. Using it, you can make your home and work printers available  
to you and anyone you choose from the applications you use every day.  
Google Cloud Print works on your phone, tablet, Chromebook, PC,  
and any other web-connected device you want to print from.  
Apple’s Cloud Service  
Apple’s cloud storage product, iCloud, is designed to work seamlessly  
with all your Apple devices connected to the Internet. For example,  
you can upload photos from your iPhone and access them from your  
MacBook, upload music from your MacBook to listen to from your  
iPod Touch, or upload an important document from your Mac desktop  
to access from your iPad when you’re on the go. iCloud’s biggest advan-  
tage is that it’s integrated into Apple software. At the same time, that  
can be a disadvantage if most of your team are not on Apple devices.128 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
iCloud’s features give you access to your data, from important con-  
tacts to fun photos, anywhere you’re connected to the Internet. You can  
authorize up to ten devices to access and use iCloud with your Apple ID.  
This is a leap beyond the iTunes Store authorization, which is limited to  
five devices. Plus, iCloud authorization extends beyond iTunes to touch  
all apps capable of connecting and to use iCloud from that device.  
Perhaps the biggest advantage of the iCloud service is how you can  
use it to back up and store data on your Apple iOS devices. iCloud is capa-  
ble of taking daily backups of your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch when it’s  
connected to the Internet using Wi-Fi. These aren’t full backups, which  
would include all the data stored on each device. Instead, these are par-  
tial backups that store only the data you’ve changed on the device.  
SERVICES FOR ONLINE STORAGE  
Google Drive  
Google Drive is a cloud storage service that allows you to store your  
documents, photos, videos, and more online in one place. From Drive,  
you can also access Google Docs, where you can create, share, and col-  
laborate on documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and more from  
anywhere while online. From an administrator’s point of view, Docs is  
a very useful service, because you can  
■  
Create and edit documents  
■ Share your documents  
■ Revert to an older version of a document  
■ Merge PDF files  
■ Export documents into Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, PDF, and  
other formats  
■ Export files as Microsoft PowerPoint, PDF, JPG, and other for-  
mats to create presentations  
■ Create a blank spreadsheet that can be exported as Microsoft  
Excel, OpenOffice, PDF, CSV, and other formatsMeeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 129  
■ Create forms that can be filled out online. Forms can be exported  
to CSV files  
In other words you can do you many jobs by using Google Docs  
and Google Drive. You need to have constant online access; otherwise  
your documents will not be available.  
Another advantage of Docs in the field of event management and  
administration is the opportunity for people to collaborate when work-  
ing on one document. You can decide which documents to share with  
whom, and you will see each person’s changes and comments. Work-  
ing together has never been so easy. Many event professionals use the  
option to create forms at the different points of the event process. It  
could be used to create different forms, such as  
■  
Preliminary questionnaires for the event  
■ Registration forms for speakers  
■ Registration forms for guests  
■ Questionnaires for event evaluation  
Google Docs also offers ready-to-use templates for event manage-  
ment, planning, budgeting, and more. It is possible to adapt the tem-  
plates to your specific needs.  
Microsoft Hybrid Cloud Storage  
Microsoft is the pioneer of automated administrative technology. Every  
administrative employee with a computer spends a lot of time acquir-  
ing data and then trying to find a way to store it. MS Hybrid Cloud  
Storage integrates on-premises storage systems with cloud storage  
services. Its Windows Azure Backup Service provides a way for users  
to automate their nightly backup processes using Windows Azure  
Storage as the location for storing that backup data. This means that  
data no longer has to occupy on-premises storage, which frees storage  
administrators from the time-consuming and error-prone tasks of  
running and managing backups.130 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Advantages of MS cloud storage include\:  
1\. Convenience\: If you store your data on a cloud storage system,  
you’ll be able to get to that data from any location where you  
have Internet access.  
2\. Flexibility\: With the right storage system, you could also allow  
other people to access the data, turning a personal project into  
a collaborative effort.  
The MS Office package provides various tools for administrative  
tasks \(word processing, spreadsheet, e-mail management, etc.\). MS  
Office is the most widely used administrative package in the world. It  
includes the programs Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook, and  
OneNote. Other MS desktop applications included in Microsoft Office  
suite include Microsoft InfoPath, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Proj-  
ect, Microsoft Visio, and SharePoint sites. It also offers clouding com-  
puting-based MS Office Online, which is a suite of web-based versions  
of Microsoft Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint.  
Other Alternatives  
Depending on the needs of your event team, there are other tools  
as well.

Zoho Docs\: This online document management program offers  
a free edition that gives users 1 GB of free space. Organiza-  
tions with a broad diversity of operating systems, browsers, and

SECURITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION  
IN THE 21ST CENTURY  
Considering the wide adoption of cloud computing and database  
management, system security of information is increasingly critical.  
As mentioned, in the cloud system the cloud-based administrative  
management system decreases the probability of information stealing  
at the office level. The remote centralized data centers provide high  
security and 24/7 monitoring of any unauthorized attempts of system  
intrusion.  
While key security management will be performed by trained secu-  
rity professionals, it is still important to have a good understanding of134 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
basic principles and mechanisms that have been successfully used by  
practitioners in actual products and systems.  
PREVENTION, DETECTION AND TOLERANCE  
The objective of data security can be approached in two distinct and  
mutually compassionate ways.  
■  
Prevention\: It ensures that security breaches cannot occur.  
Access control is performed by the system to examine every  
action and check its compliance with the security policy before  
allowing access to occur.  
■  
Detection aims to detect any security breach after it occurs. The  
auditing process uses histories of recorded activity in the sys-  
tem to detect security breaches after the fact.  
While prevention is the more fundamental technique, every informa-  
tion system employs various combinations of these two techniques.  
BASIC SECURITY CONCEPTS  
The objective of data security can be divided into three distinct but  
interrelated areas, as follows\:  
■  
Integrity\: This is concerned with improper modification of  
information or processes.  
■ Secrecy\: This is concerned with improper disclosure of infor-  
mation. The terms confidentiality or nondisclosure are syn-  
onyms for secrecy.  
■  
Availability \(denial of service\)\: This is concerned with improper  
denial of access to information.  
These three objectives arise in almost every information system,  
including meeting/event administration database management sys-  
tems \(DBMS\). For example, in the case of a payroll system, secrecy is  
concerned with preserving the confidentiality of salaries; integrity isMeeting and Event Administration Technology Solutions ² 135  
concerned with preventing an employee from changing his or her sal-  
ary; and availability is concerned with ensuring that the paychecks are  
printed on time as required by law.  
The relative importance of these three objectives varies among dif-  
ferent DBMS. For example most commercial DBMS, including meeting  
and event organizations’ DBMS, place higher importance on integrity  
as it handles customers’ both personal and financial information.  
SECURITY POLICY  
Security policies are established to clarify the before-mentioned three  
security objectives. A statement of security policy mainly consists of  
defining improper handling of the system. In general, a security policy  
is mainly determined within an organization rather than imposed by  
outside, but the proper handling of information is sometimes defined  
and mandated by law. For instance, legal and professional requirements  
apply to sensitive personal information \(such as medical information\)  
about individuals.  
CONCLUSION  
At the end of this technological chapter, we want to mention that we—  
as event specialists—are not in a position to solve one the biggest prob-  
lem in 21th century\: the security of information. Digitalization has  
made it much easier to reach a global audience, but it has also given  
rise to greater security dangers. There are some important steps we can  
take to help reduce security risks. These include\:  
■  
Reviewing carefully to whom we send e-mails. Sometimes it  
happens that we write the first name, and the computer finishes  
the e-mail address, and it may be that our intended recipient is  
is not the person by the computer.  
■  
Sharing information only with people we trust.136 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ Signing out from important apps on mobile devices when we  
finish using them. If the device gets in other people’s hands,  
they will not be able to access our information.  
When using mobile devices you have to keep in mind the following  
security measuress\:  
■  
Use security software  
■ Avoid phishing e-mails  
■ Be wise about Wi-Fi  
■ Lock up your laptop  
■ Read privacy policies  
The most underrated threat to online security is, according to  
Duncan Unwin, Chief Information Security Officer at Your Digital  
File \(2014\)\: yourself. He says\: “It’s security from your own mistakes.  
Being secure online should mean not just protection from hackers  
but it should also mean protection from someone making a mistake  
with their own data management, for instance losing passwords or  
private keys.”

INTRODUCTION  
Technology continues to open up new ways to collaborate, share,  
engage, and discover. The way that people work has never been more  
dynamic. Meeting attendees and planners are sharing information  
quicker and getting feedback faster. As the mentioned ancient Chi-  
nese proverb suggests, visual is the most effective way of experiential  
learning and networking—which are two main goals of any meeting.  
The proverb “Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once”  
can be explained by the media richness theory \(MRT\), which argues  
that face-to-face communication, a typical synchronous communica-  
tion, is a rich medium and that it reduces uncertainty as it is a real-  
time visual communication. Kock \(2005\) argued that passing on and  
observing facial expressions and body language contributed to psy-  
chological arousal. Therefore, synchronous communication is consid-  
ered as the most effective channel of communication. The Robert and  
Dennis’s \(2005\) cognitive model of media choice \(MMC\) suggests that  
synchronous communication increases an individual’s motivation and  
helps one to process messages. MMC also argues that high synchronic-  
ity increases motivation and decreases ambiguity. Specifically, remotely  
located learners are more easily distracted.  
Synchronous communication is assumed to be more natural to  
all parties involved since it resembles face-to-face interaction. Kock’s  
media naturalness hypothesis \(MNH\) \(2005\) assumes that natural  
communication involves co-location, synchronicity, and the ability  
to convey and observe facial expression, body language, and speech.  
Therefore, rich context of face-to-face communication is highly con-  
sidered as an effective class communication and content delivery.  
Hrastinski \(2008\) introduced the concepts of personal participation  
and cognitive participation to describe the dimensions of participa-Virtual Meeting and Events ² 141  
Figure 7.1. The Concepts of Cognitive and Personal Participation \(Kock,  
2001\).  
tion that are supported by synchronous and asynchronous commu-  
nication \(see Figure 7.1\). An increase in the degree of synchronicity  
improves personal participation while a decrease allows more cog-  
nitive participation.  
Innovative Internet communication technology \(ICT\) applica-  
tions coupled with improved videoconferencing capabilities have led  
to the proliferation of VMT in recent years. There have been signifi-  
cant advancements in meetings and events through virtual/distributed  
digital technologies, such as teleconferencing, web conferencing, and  
Skype or Facetime. While many think virtual meetings and events are a  
very recent invention, there has been a long history of virtual meetings  
and events, as can be seen in Figure 7.2.  
WHAT IS A VIRTUAL EVENT/MEETING?  
While there is no universal definition of virtual events/meetings, this  
chapter frames the concept as an online event occurring at a specific  
point in time, live or simulated live, which engages a unique, targeted  
audience. Digital events are a relatively new and rapidly changing ele-  
ment in an organization’s event marketing mix. According to an MPI  
report titled “Lesson Learned\: The Strategic Value of Virtual Meetings  
and Events”, many companies are beginning to add virtual meetings  
to their core business processes, particularly for education. According142 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

to Goldblatt \(2013\), the range of digital events can be defined along  
an experience and complexity continuum—ranging from a relatively  
simple one-hour webcast or webminar to complex multi-day hybrid  
events running concurrent with face-to-face meetings, and ultimately  
to robust digital experiences serving as immersive and interactive year-  
round online communities.  
WHY VIRTUAL EVENTS/MEETINGS?  
Today’s business world is global and needs a medium to connect peo-  
ple around world. Virtual events can reach the global marketplace. AsVirtual Meeting and Events ² 143  
the Internet has become the universal communication channel, vir-  
tual events often delivered via the Internet can provide a strong tool  
to reach out to global event audiences. Advancement in technology is  
happening faster and cheaper than ever before. Technology tools allow  
key players to communicate using audio, video, and even chat tools,  
which shrink the distance between companies and their employees and  
clients for the most personal attention.  
There are advantages in adopting virtual events and meetings. The  
top reason is reducing costs when compared to face-to-face meetings.  
Decreased travel budgets are common in today’s business world, and  
more and more organizations consider virtual events. Global corpo-  
rations consider virtual meetings for reducing the travel demand on  
executives, supporting last-minute meetings and sharing informa-  
tion across multiple markets and time zones. The key advantages are  
listed below\:  
■ Cost saving \(travel\)  
■ Reducing time out of office  
■ Enabling session speakers and attendees to communicate in  
real time  
■ Keeping a meeting that would be cancelled due to budget  
■ Convenience  
■ Information-sharing across multiple markets  
■ Global business operations  
■ Business continuity  
■ Supporting last-minute meetings  
Wang and Lee \(2013\) listed additional advantages of VMT espe-  
cially in regard to educational events/meetings\:  
■ Synchronous interaction\: Videoconferencing has the unique  
ability to simulate the richest form of human interaction,  
namely, face to face. Previous studies in the area of human144 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
communications show that more than 60% of all commu-  
nications are derived from nonverbal behaviors, such as  
using gestures, emotions, body language, etc. Therefore,  
live instruction via VMT offers opportunities for learners to  
develop a high level of interaction and allows them to become  
more engaged during lectures, thereby enhancing the quality  
of learning.  
■ Ease of use and convenience\: VMT applications are mostly easy  
to use, especially for today’s learners who are comfortable with  
technology and can learn a new tool quickly. With minimal  
equipment \(e.g., computer, webcam, microphone, Internet con-  
nection\), a learner can log into a live lecture session and fully  
participate in the discussion from any location. Some VMT  
applications are sophisticated and cross-platform compatible,  
allowing users to access using mobile devices, such as smart-  
phones and tablet computers. Using VMT not only brings con-  
venience to students but also exposes them to additional tools  
that they may use in their continued education and in their pro-  
fessional careers.  
■ Green technology\: VMT is not just good for attendees; it is also  
good for the environment. Since video communications are  
completely digital and transmitted over the Internet, classes  
that utilize VMT help the reduction of gasoline consumption  
and emissions and save time by reducing the number of stu-  
dents, instructors, and experts who have to commute to event  
venue.  
TYPES OF VIRTUAL MEETINGS AND EVENTS  
There are various formats, or categories, of technology for virtual meet-  
ings. Each format is unique but can be sometimes interchangeably used  
at the same time. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly review each  
and determine which type works best for a class/educational session.  
Here are several ways to consider types of technology\:Virtual Meeting and Events ² 145  
By virtual event happening time of occurrence\:  
1\) Synchronous = real time  
Synchronous VMT enables speakers and attendees to commu-  
nicate in real time, meaning “synchronous” beyond geographi-  
cal distance.  
2\) Asynchronous = recorded and flexible in time  
Asynchronous virtual event provides flexibility of time as it  
is recorded materials \(video, audio\). It emphasizes its conve-  
nience as attendees can access the virtual event any time and at  
any pace that attendees want.  
By communication method\:  
The most commonly accepted formats include 1\) audio conference;  
2\) video conference; 3\) telepresence; and 4\) 2D/3D immersion. Each  
VMT format is served with multiple major VMP service providing  
vendors and offers the following functions\:  
1\) Audio/Teleconferencing  
Audio/teleconferencing requires a traditional telephone line or  
the lowest Internet bandwidth. Visual materials are often deliv-  
ered in electronic files \(e.g. PDF or PowerPoint\). When organiz-  
ing the audio conference, there are several key considerations  
to be made in planning and coordination. First, an audio con-  
ference includes a facilitator and an audience. It is important  
to control audio input when the facilitator speaks as multiple  
audio inputs can create howling or noisy background noise that  
may reduce audio quality. Second, it is critical to address which  
page of a shared document is being discussed by all attendees as  
there is no video function on audio-only conferencing. Third,  
if the audio meeting includes new attendees, it is ideal to have  
participants state their name first so all attendees know who is  
speaking, and it also can help a note taker of the conference.146 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

Over all this is the least expensive and lowest level of technol-  
ogy required for a virtual meeting. PolycomTM \(Figure 7.3\) and  
AVAYATM manufacture high definition \(HD\) audio/teleconfer-  
ence equipment.  
2\) Video Conferencing  
Videoconferencing facilitates a face-to-face meeting environment  
across borders, clearing the way for efficient communication and  
collaborative decision-making both within and between organi-  
zations. Today, more than ever, it is proving to be an extremely  
powerful business tool, transforming day-to-day business oper-  
ations by helping to increase effectiveness, maximize resources  
and optimize productivity. Cost of video conference systems var-  
ies. Some professional systems can be expensive, but simple and

Figure 7.5. Viewable Angle of a Video Conference Room  
free solutions \(e.g. SKYPE, ooVoo\) with limited functionality are  
available. It is not necessary to purchase high-end systems if you  
can organize a video conference using cloud-based video confer-  
encing vendors \(e.g. CISCO Webex, GoToMeeting\).  
Advantages of video conferencing include\:  
■ Provides the ability to see rich content \(facial expression, body  
language\) of other attendees, which improves effectiveness of  
communication  
■ Allows participants to make more frequent contact with col-  
leagues, partners, suppliers, and customers without having to  
leave the office  
■ Reduces travel time, stress and expenses  
■ Allows for ad hoc meetings, which permits the discussion of  
urgent matters promptly, including immediate decisions  
■ Allows the sharing visual presentations  
Components of a videoconferencing system include\:  
■ Camera and microphone\: captures the image and sound of  
speakers and materials148 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ Monitor and speaker\: displays and plays video and audio  
■ Codec\: converts the video and audio into a digital signal and  
compresses it before sending it out over the network. At the  
other end, the codec decompresses the signal and feeds the pic-  
ture to a monitor and the sound to a loud speaker. \(This may  
sound complicated but the user sees none of this.\)  
As a video camera captures images of each location, logistics \(room  
set-up\) must consider a viewing angle as seen in Figures 7.4 and 7.5.  
3\. Teleprescence  
Telepresence is an immersive style of videoconferencing that emulates  
the experience of having all participants, typically between 5 and 20, in  
the same room \(see Figure 7.6 for an example\). The difference between  
telepresence and traditional videoconferencing is that more senses are  
involved. The technology transmits crystal-clear audio and high-defi-  
nition video in real-life size between rooms that are designed to match  
and appear as an extension of each other. Eye contact, facial expres-  
sions, and nonverbal cues are experienced the same way as in real life,  
making telepresence an immersive, life-like communications experi-  
ence and engaging, rich-media learning environment.  
Components of a Telepresence Room  
A telepresence room requires a more advanced and permanent instal-  
lation, and therefore, it has high infrastructure costs. These include\:  
■ a telepresence system with built-in touch screen control panel  
■ multiple room-size LCD screens that deliver high-definition  
images with robotic camera clusters that are placed at eye level  
■ integrated microphones that provide shielding to block audio  
interference  
■ high-end speakers for reproducing fine acoustic details and thin  
light reflectors that provide integrated lighting with reduced glare  
■ furniture \(executive desks and chairs\)Virtual Meeting and Events ² 149

Companies such as Cisco and BrightCom are leading providers for  
telepresence solutions in today’s market.

of the speaker, which is the closest reproduction of real person interac-  
tion. Some of the telepresence conferencing are shown here\:

VIRTUAL MEETING TECHNOLOGY \(VMT\) AND  
POPULAR SYSTEMS  
Innovative Internet applications coupled with improved videocon-  
ferencing capabilities have led to the proliferation of VMT. VMT  
represents the tools for facilitating interactive and synchronous com-  
munications that take place over the Internet using features such as  
audio and video, instant messaging, and application sharing.150 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Selecting a Virtual Meeting System  
Video and telepresence conferencing systems often require a tremen-  
dous amount of investment. Therefore, it is even more important to  
select a reputable vendor.  
The following list includes important items that influence the selec-  
tion of a video and telepresence conferencing system vendor\:  
■ A sound financial profile and a good business model  
■ A strong company history  
■ Proven customer service and support and satisfied customers  
■ Cost-effective maintenance programs  
■ Ethical business practices  
■ Enterprise-wide application solutions  
■ A true global presence for effective implementation around the  
world

■ Customer service \(explaining technology to users\)  
■ Organization \(multi-tasking several virtual meetings\)  
■ Flexibility \(last-minute needs\)  
■ Thinking quickly, inventively and with passion  
In addition, it is very crucial to work closely with in-house or out-  
side IT professionals throughout the virtual event planning and coor-  
dination effort. If there is no expert in these areas, hiring a virtual event  
professional \(e.g. digital event specialist\) or instructional design spe-  
cialist is recommended.  
NEW TREND\: HYBRID MEETINGS  
A hybrid meeting involves a mixture of physical events with elements  
of a virtual event, usually running simultaneously and with overlap-  
ping content and interactive elements. Figure 7.7 shows a diagram of a  
hybrid meeting.  
Hybrid meetings have grown rapidly with their combined advan-  
tages of both physical and virtual meetings. According to an MPI study  
Figure 7.7. Diagram of a Hybrid Meeting \(Source\: MPI Foundation,  
2012; used with permission.\). Virtual Meeting and Events ² 153  
\(2012\), this particular meeting format is predicted to grow into an  
\$18.6 billion industry by 2015. Also, it is considered to be an important  
part of the meeting industry’s future as it is considered as a new means  
of content delivery and engagement.  
Advantages of hybrid meetings include\:  
■ broadcasts to remote delegates and remote speakers  
■ connects remote locations to a main event  
■ connects multiple sites to a broadcast studio  
■ creates a legacy after the event  
New Professional Designation for Digital Event  
Planning  
As virtual meetings/events are increasingly utilized in the meeting  
and event industry, the industry seeks skilled event planners who can  
effectively engage event attendees and others through digital tech-  
nology. More and more event and meeting professionals express that  
there is a strong need for professionals who are trained to plan, pro-  
duce, and measure the results of digitally produced event efforts. To  
address this need, the meeting and event industry stakeholders have  
partnered to develop a unique certification. It is titled “Digital Event  
Strategist \(DES\)” and designed for professionals who work for various  
organizations, including associations, corporations, government and  
academia.  
The certification program consists of an application process, an  
online learning program and an exam administered by VEI. Applicants  
must fulfill several prerequisites, including\:  
■ current or recent \(within 12 months\) employment in events,  
meetings, conventions, marketing, or learning industries  
■ membership in a professional event management association,  
such as the Professional Convention Management Association154 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
\(PCMA\), Meeting Professionals International \(MPI\), Interna-  
tional Association of Exhibitions and Events \(IAEE\), Ameri-  
can Society of Association Executives \(ASAE\), Corporate Event  
Marketing Association \(CEMA\), Virtual Enterprises Interna-  
tional \(VIE\), or three years’ experience in event, meeting, con-  
vention, exhibition, or learning management  
■ experience in various virtual and digital environments, such  
as attending, producing, or exhibiting at online events or  
meetings  
■ completion of \(or will complete\) 25 clock hours \(or 2.5 CEUs\)  
worth of digital-related continuing education programs in 16  
key areas of focus within 12 months of application  
The DES Online Learning Program covers the key areas of focus  
in the exam through a 16-module course in digital event planning and  
production. Applicants earn CEU credit for each completed module,  
for a total of 16 hours in digital event training. Applicants must pass the  
exam, administered online, within 12 months of application. Because  
digital technology is constantly evolving and changing, all participants  
must recertify every two years and fulfill the continuing education  
requirement of 20 hours over two years. No exam will be required if  
certification is maintained.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
This chapter contributes toward a better understanding of the emerg-  
ing VMT technologies that will impact meetings and events in the near  
future. The role of virtual meetings is evolving although doubters wor-  
ried that this technology faced too many challenges. In an era of fast  
broadband, mobility, and flexibility, VMT offers an effective, affordable,  
green solution to many challenges faced by today’s IT educators. MoreVirtual Meeting and Events ² 155  
and more organizations are organizing virtual meetings, and others are  
showing interest in hosting one.  
As the industry continues to experiment and gain more experience  
with virtual events and meetings, this format of virtual events will pro-  
vide a tool for event professionals to offer new and creative events that  
add value to their businesses. The various VMT options and formats  
are utilized by meeting/event planners according to goals, set-ups and  
the profile of attendees. The successful application of VMT in different  
event/meeting set-ups and exemplifying the use of VMT as an effective  
technology can be an enabler of active engagement.  
In an era of fast Internet and mobility, VMT can offer an effective  
and affordable solution to challenges, such as inviting keynote speakers  
and the latest version of training to a physical session room. Therefore,  
today’s planners should consider and utilize VMT in terms of ways to  
connect attendees beyond the four walls of meeting rooms as it can  
open a door to provide effective tools for improved attendees’ meeting  
experiences.

INTRODUCTION  
The Walt Disney Company planned to create one of the most techno-  
logically advanced attractions in the world through the development  
of the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow \(EPCOT\).  
Walt Disney envisioned EPCOT as a place where people would live and  
work with the best technology provided by industry. Although EPCOT  
was first conceived by Walt Disney in the 1970s along with the plan-  
ning of Walt Disney World when it finally opened in 1982, EPCOT was  
a vastly different proposition.  
Following Walt Disney’s death, the planners at Walt Disney World  
did not believe they could bring to fulfillment Disney’s original  
dream without his inspiration. Therefore, they redesigned EPCOT to  
both showcase technology \(Future World\) along with world cultures  
\(World Showcase\) through a series of pavilions sponsored by individ-  
ual companies.  
The iconic centerpiece of the attraction is the geodesic dome enti-  
tled Spaceship Earth, which is based on the designs of the legendary  
U.S. architect Richard Buckminster Fuller. Spaceship Earth has fea-  
tured for over thirty years early demonstrations of Skype and Google  
Hangouts as well as other futuristic communications technologies.  
Fuller once recalled seeing a giant ship sail by and experiencing an  
epiphany\:  
Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little  
man could do. Think of the Queen Mary cruise ship—the whole  
ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there’s a tiny thing  
at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab.  
It’s a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds  
a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no  
effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab.Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 159  
Society thinks it’s going right by you that it’s left you altogether.  
But if you’re doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you  
can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state  
is going to go.  
So I said, call me Trim Tab. \(Buckminster Fuller Institute,  
2014\)  
Although EPCOT evolved from Walt Disney’s early dream of a  
prototype community of tomorrow, it continues to educate, innovate,  
and transform public opinion regarding technology through its state-  
of-the-art information architecture. The “imagineers” at Walt Disney  
World recognized early on that constant evaluation and interven-  
tion \(trim tab\) was required to ensure the positive evolution of their  
world-renowned attraction. The same thinking must apply to your  
approach to meeting and event technological evaluation.  
Measure the return on investment of your meeting  
and event technology decisions  
According to Jack Phillips, co-author of Return on Investment in Meet-  
ings and Events\: Tools and Techniques to Measure the Success of all Types  
of Meetings and Events \(Phillips, Breining, and Phillips, 2007\), ROI is  
the financial measure classically defined as the earnings divided by the  
investment, times 100, expressed as a percent. Essentially, this shows  
the monetary return on investing in a particular project or program.  
A meeting or event is both a project and a program. Therefore,  
when you measure the ROI of your meeting or event, you are finding  
out as precisely as possible what your meeting or event is costing and  
what your organization is receiving in return for this investment.  
Technology enables you to measure the ROI of your meeting and  
event through calculating the exact costs and the expenditures by all of  
your stakeholders \(suppliers, sponsors, as well as attendees\) and com-  
pare these expenditures to the return you are receiving from hosting  
this meeting or event.160 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
ROI % = \(Return – Cost of investment\) x 100  
Cost of investment  
Figure 8.1. Return on Investment Formula  
The basic calculation for ROI is shown in Figure 8.1.  
When you invest in new technology for your meeting or event, the  
rate of return should be higher than the meeting itself. For example,  
achieving a 200% rate of return over a four-year period is optimal.  
AXIA Consulting \(2014\) recommends that you also remember the fol-  
lowing additional benefits when measuring the return on investment  
from new technology, such as  
■ travel reduction through online meetings replacing face-to-face  
meetings, with remote support replacing onsite support,  
■ time saved because of increased productivity and reduction in  
time to complete tasks  
■ time saved from reduced length/number of customer service  
calls  
■ time saved from reduced numbers of errors  
■ time saved from improved system reliability and having less  
maintenance or fewer problems to resolve  
■ time saved with improved software vendor support and, there-  
fore, quicker responses and faster fixes.  
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives \(ACTE\) reported  
in 2013 that nearly 90 percent of travel executives stated that mobile  
technology was having a moderate to significant impact on their travel  
program \(AXIA Consulting, 2014\).  
The survey conducted by ACTE also confirmed that nearly twen-  
ty-five percent of corporate travel departments have a mobile policy for  
corporate travel. Nearly 40 percent of corporate organizations provide  
mobile devices for their employees.Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 161  
However, according to the ACTE respondents, only 24 percent of  
the corporate organizations surveyed actually encourage their employ-  
ees to use travel applications. Nearly 32 percent of the companies do  
not have a policy for the use of travel applications.  
The ACTE study also confirmed that using a mobile application to  
look for and book travel is just one piece of a highly complex corporate  
travel puzzle. The respondents stated that often they are more comfort-  
able using e-mail or contacting the travel desk of their corporation to  
conduct the travel booking transaction. However, using a mobile appli-  
cation is preferred for simple or last-minute travel booking.  
ACTE officials concluded from this study that as more employ-  
ees use smartphones to manage their leisure time, the demand for  
mobile in business travel is higher than ever. By participating in policy  
development, corporate travel executives can ensure mobile use does  
not become excessively costly or unwieldy to manage. Governed by a  
well-developed policy, mobile can then become a hugely valuable asset  
to their business, keeping their employees informed and giving them  
unparalleled flexibility when traveling to and within their destination.  
In addition to these tangible benefits, there are many other intan-  
gible benefits that accrue from the use of technology to measure the  
effectiveness of meetings and events.  
Brynjolfsson and Hitt argued in 2000 that computers are not merely  
number crunchers; rather they are symbol processors. They are used  
to organize, transmit, and algorithmically transform any type of infor-  
mation that may be digitized, including numbers, text, video, music,  
speech, programs, engineering diagrams, and much more.  
As computer technology has rapidly and exponentially grown since  
2000, so have the intangible impacts and benefits for meeting and event  
participants. The terms “user friendly” and “user experience” are fre-  
quently used in the vernacular of personal and mobile computing tech-  
nology to signify the overall importance of satisfying the needs, wants,  
and desires of the end user.162 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Abraham Maslow is well known for his psychological theory of a  
hierarchy of human needs. Maslow \(1954\) places self-actualization at  
the apex of this hierarchy. However, today self-actualization may also  
be measured in terms of connectivity, bandwidth, and data download  
speed. Therefore, when designing and selecting appropriate technology  
for your meeting and event, it is equally important to remember to  
measure the human needs and feelings that will result from the incor-  
poration of this technology. In order to measure the human experience  
as related to technology, you may wish to consider the following key  
questions\:  
■ First, what are the expectations of your meeting and event par-  
ticipants? Do they expect to experience Wi-Fi everywhere or  
are they content to use Wi-Fi zones only for stronger connec-  
tivity?  
■ Second, what hardware and software will your participants be  
using? The types of applications they may use could determine  
speed of your Wi-Fi signal and could also lead to creating chal-  
lenges with their connectivity and speed.  
■ Third and finally, what are the key performance indicators for  
each participant in terms of their individual return on invest-  
ment and return on objective?  
The term “return on objective” is relatively new in terms of perfor-  
mance measurement and encompasses a wide range of factors. These  
factors may include but not be limited to networking, education, recog-  
nition, and reward. The factors may directly relate to the technological  
resources available before, during, and after your meeting and event.  
Figure 8.2 depicts how at every stage of Maslow’s well-regarded  
and often-cited hierarchy of needs, the technological return on objec-  
tive may be measured in human terms. Therefore, it is increasingly  
important that you consider identifying the key factors each of your  
participants identifies as important prior to finalizing the technological  
resources for your meeting and event.Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 163

One tool for conducting this measurement satisfaction with tech-  
nology is MeetingMetrics. MeetingMetrics, based in New York City,  
provides thousands of questions for meeting and event planners to  
measure return on objective, as well as return on investment. The sys-  
tem they use is similar to those that are available for free \(SurveyMon-  
key and Zoomerang\) or at reduced cost; however, MeetingMetrics  
provides thousands of pre-written questions that allow you to com-  
pare your meeting or event to thousands of others that are recorded  
by this firm.  
Furthermore, the MeetingMetrics system includes a pre-survey  
and a post-survey as well as a pulse phase to allow you to recheck your  
results the closer you are to the actual meeting or event date.  
Regardless of which electronic survey system you use, it is criti-  
cally important that you comprehensively collect the information you  
need to make smart technology decisions to effectively measure the164 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
return on investment, return on objective, as well as return on market-  
ing investment for your meeting and event.  
Evaluate the return on marketing investment of your  
meeting and event technology decisions  
Colin Loveday is Managing Director and founder of 4G Scotland.  
According to Loveday \(2013\), one of the major challenges in mobile  
technology will be great collaboration among former competitors. The  
Global System for Mobile Communications \(GSM\) is a universal stan-  
dard for mobile communications, and by 2005 this standard included  
75 percent of the worldwide mobile networks. The GSM standard is  
for 2 G and does not include 3 and 4 G. The city of Macau \(Special  
Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China\) has decided that  
in June 2015 they will decommission 2 G to concentrate entirely on  
the faster 3 and 4 G standard. The University Mobile Technology Sys-  
tems \(UMTS\) is a third general mobile standard that is used widely  
in the United States and the United Kingdom. Loveday believes that  
more and more former competitors will work together to achieve a  
common standard to improve operations and marketing performance  
for mobile technology.  
The use of technology to make us become more human is, accord-  
ing to Loveday, one of the future developments we may expect from  
meetings and events technology. This may include interaction with 3D  
printers, robotics, and other emerging technologies before, during, and  
after the meeting and event. He states that the successful meeting and  
event marketer must first understand human nature and then develop  
the technological platforms and solutions to support future needs,  
wants, and desires.  
According to Christopher Preston, author of Event Marketing\: How  
to Successfully Promote Events, Festivals, Conventions, and Expositions,  
2nd Edition \(2012\), there are six Ps that impact the effectiveness of your  
marketing plan. These include\:Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 165  
1\. Product\: Your meeting, event, exhibition, incentive program, etc.  
2\. Place\: The physical location \(destination and venue of your  
event  
3\. Price\: The price \(registration fee, exhibitor fee, other fees\) as  
determined by perceived value and competitive forces  
4\. Public Relations\: The research and information you dissemi-  
nate to create interest and build credibility about your meeting  
or event  
5\. Promotion\: The advertising and direct sales activities that will  
promote sales transactions for your meeting or event  
6\. Positioning\: The unique position your event secures in the mar-  
ket place.  
The first five Ps may each be linked to emerging technologies by  
creating a strong brand \(product\), a sense of physical space \(floor  
plan\), an added value to promote price acceptance \(free application  
use\), a third-party endorsement \(social media\), and electronic trans-  
actions \(website\).  
However, the most powerful for the modern meeting and event  
planner is the sixth P where you may position your meeting and event  
as the most technologically advanced, friendly, and valuable among all  
of the similar choices they may have in terms of meeting and event  
investment. Positioning your meeting or event as a unique value due to  
your investment in the most effective and valuable technology will best  
serve your guests and exhibitors.  
The measurement of this value is often represented as return on  
marketing investment \(ROMI\). ROMI systematically measures the  
percentage of return on your meeting and event technology invest-  
ment. For example, if you invest \$1000 in marketing your new technol-  
ogy application to your guest and exhibitors, you may also budget to  
generate new sales \(registration fees, exhibitor fees\) that provide a five166 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
to seven or more return on this original investment. It is the responsi-  
bility of the meeting and event planning organization to establish the  
desired return on marketing investment.  
However, there are two types of return on marketing formulas.  
Short term is a simple index measuring the return of marketing dollars  
for every one that marketing spends. Long term may be used to deter-  
mine less tangible benefits of marketing. For example, it could be used  
incrementally to measure brand awareness over time or to recall the  
names of key sponsors for your meeting or event.  
Meeting and event technology will most often use a long-term  
approach to measuring return on marketing investment as this will  
measure the tangible as well as intangible benefits you derive from your  
technology marketing investment. Table 8.1 provides an example of the  
long-term intangible and tangible benefits that you may measure using  
different sets of metrics.  
In most cases, due to the rapidly expanding use of technology  
in meetings and events, you must use the long-term approach to  
accurately and comprehensively measure your return on marketing  
investment. You must also be aware of the exogenous variables, such

Auxiliary events Increased sales Faster sales  
\(tours, etc.\)  
Virtual education Increased registrations Improved learning Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 167  
as the macro economy may also impact your sales and registration  
growth year upon year. Therefore, it is often better to measure ROMI  
over a multiyear period such as three, four or five years to determine  
an average return from which you will set new realistic targets in the  
future.  
One way to continually increase your return on marketing invest-  
ment through technology is to plan to provide the most optimum user-  
friendly experience for your guests and others. This may be challenging  
due to the wide range of technological experience that your partici-  
pants bring to your meeting and events as well as the limited technol-  
ogy architecture that is available for your use.  
Analyze the user friendliness and usage of your  
meeting and event technology operations  
The term “user friendliness” was probably coined in the late 1970s and  
early 1980s as geek speak for “keep it simple, stupid.” The reality is that  
no matter how effective or efficient your technological solution may be,  
someone must first want to engage with it, and when they do they must  
find the experience simple, easy, and successful.  
Is It Simple?  
When designing technological solutions for your meeting or event,  
you may wish to ask yourself if your new application, software, or  
other solution will pass the “elevator test”. Imagine you are on the  
first floor of a five-story office building. By the time the elevator rises  
from the ground floor to the fifth floor, can you simply explain the  
purpose, function, and applicability of your technological solution  
to others? If you find this difficult, you may need to simplify your  
technological solution so that your board, your staff, and all of your  
stakeholders appreciate the value of your decision. Here is one exam-  
ple of how to simplify the description of your new technological  
solution\:168 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
“We are using Cvent’s CrowdTorch system so that we have one over-  
all solution for ticketing, mobile communications, engaging with  
our participants, managing our website, improving networking for  
our members, and collecting comprehensive data that will help us  
make better decisions in the future.”  
Is It Easy?  
Some of your stakeholders may understand the purpose and function  
of your new technology, but they may face a severe obstacle when it  
comes to applying this technology to their daily needs. Therefore, it is  
helpful if you provide a short tutorial, webinar, or other instructional  
opportunity to introduce the new technology to your stakeholders. It is  
also helpful to identify technology champions who appear to be more  
confident so that they may mentor others.  
Are We Successful?  
Success is a relative condition based upon the growing confidence  
your participants demonstrate through repeated use of your technol-  
ogy. However, to develop this courage within your participants they  
will need encouragement. Therefore, as soon as you begin using the  
new technologies, share your success stories to all users through your  
website, a blog, e-mail, or other communications. It is also helpful to  
have group face-to-face meetings and have people discuss the benefits  
of using this technology and to ask any questions regarding challenges  
they may be experiencing. Finally, you may wish to begin collecting  
user data as soon as possible and share this quantitative and quali-  
tative feedback with all participants so that they see that your new  
technology is being embraced and is achieving the goals and objec-  
tives you have established. Further, you may wish to express these suc-  
cessful outcomes in terms of return on marketing investment so that  
your stakeholders recognize the business case for adopting this new  
technology.Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 169  
Strategize new ways to invest in meeting  
and event technologies at lower cost  
and higher return on investment  
Recently, Janet Yellen, the first female chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve,  
was asked about perceived economic recovery taking place in the United  
States. She soberly stated that “The recovery still feels like a recession to  
many Americans” \(2014\). Although there has been some recovery and  
stabilizing of financial markets, most meeting and event planners are  
being asked year after year to continually do more with less.  
There are five ways that you may systematically reduce your overall  
costs when investing in meeting and event technology.  
■ First, you may wish to use freeware and/or shareware. Accord-  
ing to the Free Software Foundation \(2015\), an organization  
designed to promote the use of free software and defend user  
freedoms, freeware is a loosely defined category that has no  
accepted definition although it is distinguished from free soft-  
ware. Some popular examples of closed-source freeware include  
Adobe Reader, Free Studio, and Skype.  
Shareware is similar to freeware; however, usually after a pre-  
scribed trial period, you must pay for some additional func-  
tionality. Still another form of shareware is available only for  
educational or personal usage.  
■ Secondly, you can purchase off-the-shelf technology products  
that may be easily customized for your meeting and event busi-  
ness needs. For example, you may wish to purchase contact  
management software to manage your registration and then  
customize this product with data fields that are specific for your  
organization’s needs. If you have a limited budget, you will not  
want to invest in hiring a software developer to create a custom-  
ized solution for you from scratch.  
■ Thirdly, you may wish to partner with other meeting and event  
organizations to reduce your costs. The International Festivals170 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
and Events Association offers an evaluation technological sys-  
tem for festivals that was first developed in Australia. This sys-  
tem is offered at a lower cost because it is jointly shared by many  
festivals and event organizers throughout the world. Further, if  
you use this Encore Evaluation System software, you will then  
be able to make some direct comparisons with the results from  
other festivals and events.  
The cost of new technology generally declines over time. This is  
caused by the factors of supply and demand. As rival products enter  
the marketplace, the original products often lose market share and  
must lower their prices to remain competitive. For example, when the  
first tablet was introduced by Apple, the cost was well over \$700. How-  
ever, in 2014 similar Android tablets were available at a cost of under  
\$100.00.  
Although costs will generally be reduced over time in the market-  
place, the user experience must continue to be improved if you are to  
develop loyal and committed meeting and technology stakeholders.  
Continuously improve the user experience through  
meeting and event technology  
To improve any customer experience it is important that you and your  
meeting and event organization continually look to the future to see  
what is on the horizon in terms of future stakeholder needs. One way  
to do this is to monitor the external environment and scan for changes  
in global business and popular culture.  
The rapid movement from the personal computer to the tablet and  
mobile telephone has been well chronicled. What has been given less  
attention is how these tools will continue to support the needs of a rap-  
idly aging group of users. According to the United States Department  
of Health and Human Services \(2014\), persons over 65 years old num-  
bered 39.6 million in 2009 \(the latest year for which data is available\).  
They represented 12.9% of the U.S. population, about one in every eightEvaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 171  
Americans. By 2030, there will be about 72.1 million older persons,  
more than twice their number in 2000. People 65+ represented 12.4%  
of the population in the year 2000 but are expected to grow to be 19%  
of the population by 2030.  
How will these tools be adapted to support a population whose eye-  
sight may be diminished and who may not have the motor skills for  
rapid texting as is the norm today? Technology developers are certainly  
aware of these demographic shifts and are preparing products that will  
provide additional support for these aging baby boomers. For example,  
the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation \(2013\), UK, in conjunction with  
Independent Age, reported in 2013 that there in some areas, a startling  
70 percent of people over the age of 65 had never used the Internet.  
Therefore, technology usage is different among demographic  
groups and is characterized most often in the popular media with two  
subgroups, called digital natives \(those in Generation X and the Millen-  
nials who were born after the development of key computer technolo-  
gies\) and the digital immigrants who were born before the development  
of key technologies. However, what is often overlooked is that many of  
the digital immigrants were also the inventors and developers of these  
technologies.  
Regardless of whether your meeting and event participants are dig-  
ital natives or digital immigrants, one thing is for absolute certain\: they  
will all age and their technology needs will change over time as a result  
of the aging process. Therefore, it is important to practice the ABCs of  
growing the user experience over the working lifetime of the meeting  
and event participant.  
■ A is for Access. It is important that you provide the widest  
possible meeting and event technology. The same application  
that works well on your personal computer does not necessar-  
ily work as well on the mobile unit. Therefore, it is important  
to make certain your pre-, during and post-meeting and event  
technology applications are designed for the widest possible  
usage.172 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ B is for Broadband. Connectivity and speed will continue to  
dominate the needs of meeting and event participants. There-  
fore, you must plan to satisfy these key needs by conducting a  
thorough assessment of the numbers of users and the types of  
applications they will be using, and then provide the broadband  
capacity needed to support these applications.  
■ C is for Communications. According to Independent Age \(2013\),  
the number one desire of older people for technology is to con-  
nect with others. This may result from the often-reported sense  
of isolation and loneliness that results from aging. As we age we  
often experience physical distance from our children and other  
family members, and in some cases users may suffer the loss  
of a partner or spouse. Therefore, the opportunity to connect,  
communicate and collaborate with others becomes a paramount  
need in our lives. Your online education, communication, and  
other relationship-building tools may result in not only improv-  
ing the user experience but also in expanding the number of  
participants in your meetings and events in the future.  
While these ABCs of growing and improving the user experience are  
not comprehensive, they do demonstrate how important it is to promote  
relevance and speed when designing future technologies for meeting  
and event participants. The number, range, and cost of new meeting and  
event technologies will most likely expand more rapidly in the next five  
years than they have in the past fifty years. Your guests will have many  
different choices. Therefore, to remain a preferred provider of meeting  
and event experiences for an aging population, you must pick up your  
pace. One way to do this is to identify the future mobile and broadband  
needs and capacity for future generations of mobile users.  
Anticipate the future mobile and broadband capacity  
for meeting and event technology users  
According to Corbin Ball, in 2014 there were more smartphones in use  
on planet earth than people. As the number of mobile devices expandsEvaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 173  
exponentially in developing countries such as Africa, it is also import-  
ant to provide the broadband infrastructure to support these growing  
needs.  
Toby French \(2015\) observed that at the end of March 2013, there  
were 654.6 million fixed broadband lines across the world. This rep-  
resents a growth of 2.0% in the quarter, which was broadly consistent  
with growth in the previous three quarters. There has been a signif-  
icant drop in copper cable lines and a rising demand for fiber optic  
services.  
This global broadband growth is not evenly distributed throughout  
the world. The fastest growth in broadband capacity is in East Asia.  
However, when these statistics are analyzed by technology within each  
region, it becomes obvious that fiber optic transmission is rapidly  
expanding globally, although in the Americas most broadband is deliv-  
ered via cable.  
The top five broadband countries in 2013 were China, the United  
States, Japan, Germany, and the Russian Federation. China was the  
dominant country, with 184 million subscribers, followed by the United  
States, with 94 million. The global growth in broadband subscribers  
between Q3 2011 and Q1 2013 was 2.5 percent, and in 2013 the fastest  
broad band growth was in Asia and the East, followed by Europe and  
then America \(Point Topic, 2013\).  
Of the top ten broadband countries in the world, India was in tenth  
place, with 15 million subscribers \(Point Topic, 2013\).  
From this dramatic growth in broadband usage in the developing  
world, North American and European meeting and event profession-  
als must recognize the significant potential future threats to their pro-  
grams if they do not continue to place pressure upon national and local  
governments to increase broadband capacity to benefit their delegates.  
Perhaps one future lobbying issue for the modern meetings and events  
industry will indeed be technological infrastructure as the meetings and174 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
events industry recognizes that they must clearly and convincingly con-  
vey to government leaders the need for this expansion.  
While in the period from 1970 through 2000 the main effort placed  
in lobbying by the hospitality industry in North America may have  
been upon the need for the physical expansion of conference centers, in  
the twenty-first century the new and even greater effort may need to be  
placed upon the need to significantly increase broadband capacity for  
visiting delegates. The competitive edge for destinations may no longer  
be physical space but instead will be the ability to provide stable, wide-  
spread, and fast and unlimited broadband connectivity and storage  
space for meeting and event technology users. The meeting and event  
planners’ ability to forecast and satisfy these future demands from their  
participants may determine the winners and losers in the race for dom-  
inance as best destinations to conduct meetings and events throughout  
the twenty-first century.  
Forecast future demand for meeting and event  
technology by your staff, attendees, and suppliers  
Historically, future demand has been predicted through historical data  
and a strategic audit of the external environment in which meetings  
and events take place. This may no longer be true in the future when  
major external global forces such as technology, global warming, and  
economic uncertainty and migration patterns strongly influence the  
growth of the modern meetings and events industry.  
Figure 8.3 depicts how these forces may impact future demand fac-  
tors in the global meetings and events industry in the next ten years.  
TECHNOLOGY  
As technology continues to grow and dominate our lives, it is import-  
ant for meeting and event professionals to anticipate this demand by  
seeking opportunities to provide differentiated, unique, fast, and easy-  
to-use as well as stable products and services to improve the lives of  
their participants.Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 175  
GLOBAL WARMING  
The well-documented rise of global temperatures has resulted in  
dramatically changing weather patterns, higher energy costs, and  
the potential relocation of meetings that are associated with chang-  
ing business and leisure travel patterns. Therefore, meeting and  
event professionals will need to respond to these changing patterns  
by providing alternative locations and venues, and wherever possi-  
ble, by reducing travel distance to demonstrate their commitment  
to reducing the global carbon footprint. Technology may be used  
where appropriate to reduce the damaging effects of global travel.  
However, technology must not be used as a replacement for those  
critical face-to-face meetings and events that require human con-  
tact to achieve the best outcomes. Therefore, in the future, meet-  
ing and event professionals will need to carefully balance the need  
for face-to-face experiences with the damaging impacts of global  
travel. Meeting and event attendees in the future will be better edu-  
cated about the damaging impacts of travel and energy costs and  
Figure 8.3. Global Forces and Their Impacts on Meetings and Events  
\(Source\: Goldblatt, 2014\) 176 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
therefore will consider these factors when selecting which meet-  
ings and events they will support. Therefore, there may be growing  
opportunities for technology to assess, project, forecast, and deter-  
mine the negative and positive impacts of global travel to meetings  
and events. Used properly, these technologies may also be able to  
increase the demand for more appropriate face-to-face meetings  
supplemented by technology.  
MIGRATION PATTERNS  
Warfare, famine, economic deprivation, and other forces have  
increased the level of global migration to unprecedented levels in the  
past decade. As a result of these increased migration patterns, neigh-  
boring nation states who receive asylum seekers are often hard pressed  
to provide for their needs in a sustainable manner. This may impact  
the future of global meetings and events by changing the resources  
that are available within certain countries \(a recent example would  
be Jordan\) as they seek to cope with providing for complex health,  
education, and other needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees.  
Meeting and event technology may be leveraged by meeting profes-  
sionals to forecast where future migration patterns may develop, and  
this may determine the future location of their meetings and events as  
well as the content of their programs. Through the use of sophisticated  
algorithm monitoring systems, meeting and event professionals and  
their supplier partners may be able to better predict these changes and  
anticipate the need for future development of venues, accommoda-  
tions, and workers to meet this demand.  
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY  
Perhaps the most overarching force that will impact technology, global  
warming, and even migration patterns, is the continuing economic  
uncertainty throughout the world’s financial markets. While there is  
no assurance that long-term stability will be achieved along the same  
lines of the 1950s postwar period, there is the opportunity to use meet-  
ing and event technology to reduce some costs associated with labor,Evaluation of Meeting and Event Technology ² 177  
shipping, equipment, instruction, travel, and other key expenses his-  
torically associated with meetings and events. Furthermore, in addi-  
tion to reducing costs, meeting and event technologies, especially those  
linked to continuing professional education, may generate even greater  
financial benefits than the traditional face-to-face experiences of the  
past. Who knows, perhaps one day virtual meetings and events will  
provide the greater economic lucre to subsidize and ensure the future  
of face-to-face meetings. Regardless, the modern meeting and event  
professional must embrace technology as a tool for lowering costs and  
driving new future revenues to ensure economic sustainability for their  
meeting and event organization.  
While these are certainly not the only four forces that will most  
likely determine the future sustainability of global meetings and events,  
they are important considerations with regard to developing technol-  
ogies. Future technologies will not only provide greater opportunities  
to forecast demand for meeting and event services but will, even more  
importantly, provide the flexibility, rapidity, and creativity to address  
and solve future global problems that will impact meetings and events.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
The evaluation of meeting and event technology must be an ongo-  
ing process. This process may begin with the great unknown about  
what technological needs, wants, and desires your future meetings  
and events participants will have to select your meeting and event as  
a preferred provider for their education, networking, and other pro-  
fessional and personal requirements. However, this great unknown,  
through the use of appropriate meeting and event technologies, may  
provide you and your organizations with significant long-term savings  
as well as increased revenues to support other aspects of your mis-  
sion and vision. Therefore, meeting and event technology, while not a  
panacea for all of the ills of meetings and events industry in the twen-  
ty-first century, is certainly a key and critical factor to help continually  
improve your competitive position through providing the very best  
user experience.178 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

“The Internet has become a remarkable fount of economic and social  
innovation largely because it’s been an archetypal level playing field,  
on which even sites with little or no money behind them—blogs, say,  
or Wikipedia—can become influential.”

LEARNING OUTCOMES  
As a result of reading this chapter, you will learn how to\:  
■ Be part of the power of Wikipedia  
■ Plan your website structure for better success  
■ Create website strategy  
■ Establish and maintain a company web blog  
■ Use your company blog for marketing purposes  
■ Use the advantages of podcast as well as the reasons why those  
forms of creating content matter for your event  
183 184 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
WIKIPEDIA  
It is nearly impossible to imagine the world without the Internet. For  
all kinds of information we search online and expect to find the right  
information with just one click of a button. It is this situation that forces  
organizations to create content in different forms and upload it online  
for consumers who are searching. In the beginning it was easy as the  
information online was not so huge in quantity. Nowadays one of the  
biggest challenges is not just to find information, but also to find the  
right information you need. If you do a search online, it is impossible  
to miss the enormous bulk of results that lead you to the website of  
the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. As statistics show, Wikipedia articles  
are a constituent part of 95% of all Google searches. Even poor quality  
pages in Wikipedia get millions of hits because they benefit from the  
popularity of the site \(King, 2011\).  
“Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclope-  
dia project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on an  
openly editable model. The name ‘Wikipedia’ is a portmanteau of the  
words wiki \(a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the  
Hawaiian word wiki, meaning ‘quick’\) and encyclopedia. Wikipedia’s  
articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with  
additional information” \(Wikipedia\).  
While this chapter was written, Wikipedia was comprised of  
4,508,631 content articles, with 32,828,738 pages in total, 831,041  
uploaded files, 21,299,258 registered users, including 1,409 adminis-  
trators. All those users work for Wikipedia without any payment at all.  
In addition to this, Wikipedia has versions in 285 languages. Before  
going into details about how to use Wikipedia for an event, we need  
to mention some basic facts and rules for using Wikipedia for busi-  
ness purposes. First of all, we must bear in mind that it is not a social  
media service, in spite of the fact that its content is user-generated. It is  
an encyclopedia, and that’s why its materials should contain reference  
information. Virtually speaking, everyone can add articles, although  
not all articles will be published. In most cases other people will editMarketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 185  
your article or add more information. You should be prepared that  
there is no ownership of the information on Wikipedia.  
The fundamental principles on the basis of which Wikipedia  
operates can be summarized into five major “pillars”  
\:  
1\. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia—not a free platform for  
advertising.  
2\. Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view—which  
means that it does not include editors’ personal experiences,  
interpretations, or opinions.  
3\. Wikipedia provides free content that anyone can edit, use,  
modify, and distribute—including you.  
4\. Editors should treat each other with respect and civility—  
that is, actually, the only means to pave the way for efficient  
collarative work.  
5\. Wikipedia does not have any firm rules—it has policies and  
guidelines, but they are not carved in stone. \(Wikipedia\)  
As we strive to learn how to create content for our event in this enor-  
mous online encyclopedia, we have to review the three core content  
policies which we have to follow or be well-informed if someone breaks  
them in connection to our event, speaker or topic\:  
Neutral point of view\: All Wikipedia articles and other  
encyclopedic contents must be written from a neutral point of view,  
representing significant views fairly, proportionately, and without  
any bias.  
Verifiability\: Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and  
all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source. In  
Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the  
encyclopedia can check that information comes from reliable sources.  
No original research\: Wikipedia does not publish original thought;  
all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published  
source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of186 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
published material that serves to advance a position not clearly  
advanced by the sources \(Wikipedia, 2014\).  
In most cases people will go to Wikipedia to find basic information  
about your organization, your speaker, your topic, etc., and in case they  
don’t, they may ask themselves why they should consider your event at  
all. Of course, it is not possible to create a wide range of articles about one  
event there. Although each event is usually created by an organization,  
the articles in Wikipedia should be focus on the organization and not  
the events themselves. The spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation  
says, “Wikipedia is a complex culture, and sometimes it can feel like the  
free encyclopedia everyone can edit—except me” \(Zetlin, 2012\). In the  
beginning many feel a similar disappointment. Nevertheless, it is not  
very difficult to understand the rules and principles so that you can  
start writing for Wikipedia.  
What kind of information can we add about events?  
Of course, it is not possible to expect that each event will attract people’s  
attention and will result in a separate article in Wikipedia, yet if you  
look at your event bearing the three core content policies in mind, you  
will find different opportunities. Here are a few of them\:  
■ The speakers \(provided you have some\) are experts in their  
field. Check to see if there are already any articles about them  
and if so, you can add information about their next activities  
with your meeting.  
■ The topic of your event might be the crossing point. There may  
be enough information at your disposal that you can summarize  
in an article.  
■ The location, providing that it is an important location with  
historic, architectural, or cultural significance, can be an entry  
point. You can either check for some interesting articles, add  
information, or create your own material.  
■ The technology, if you use new technology, can be a perfect  
opportunity to write about. You can add information to aMarketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 187  
published material, for example, if you are doing 3D mapping  
on an imposing building or you can look up for an article about  
the building and add a picture as well as some other interesting  
information.  
There are various other opportunities for contributing to Wikipedia  
to indirectly promote your event. The Chartered Institute of Public  
Relations \(2014\) published recently an online guide for PR professionals  
about the use of Wikipedia. In fact, as this is an encyclopedia, if people  
are searching for your information, someone among the huge army of  
editors will add some materials about your topic. As we have already  
discussed, it is not a social media but a network of people working  
together, so if you are interested in improving Wikipedia, either you  
or some of your team members should become a volunteer. By far  
the best way is to start with articles about something that you love or  
are passionate about. Think about some factors which will increase  
notability. In most cases three factors can be outlined\:  
■ Biographical articles\: People consult the encyclopedia to find  
biographical information about companies and people. So be  
ready to offer it, though it should be informative, not marketing-  
orientated.  
■ Trade publications\: These give credibility and support from  
the professional field.  
■ Authority publications\: These will help if you have been men-  
tioned in the well-known publications, such as The New York  
Times, although other popular media will help too.  
As you can see, Wikipedia prefers to publish materials about top-  
ics that have already been covered by other media and have become a  
point of interest to people. In any case, your event contains points of  
interest for broad audiences. You have to consider carefully which facts  
related to your event can be described and then write it follow Wikipe-  
dia’s rules closely for adding information.  
However, Wikipedia can also be a source of problems, such as when  
it contains misleading information connected to your events. If you188 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
find some inaccurate information, there are a few things you can do.  
First, you can fix it yourself! Anyone can edit Wikipedia. Just click the  
“edit” button on the top righthand corner of the page, make the correc-  
tion, and press “Save page.”  
In case you are not willing to correct an error yourself, you can go  
to the topic “How to report a problem with an article, or find out more  
information” and follow the guidelines. Bear in mind that the correc-  
tions will not happen immediately.  
By way of a summary, we should point out that Wikipedia is a free  
encyclopedia that can be used by your potential guests as a referable  
source of information. To make your information referable, you need  
to be sure that there is enough accurate and relevant information con-  
cerning your events. If one of the major principles of lean management  
is to be applied here, we can say\: Genchi Genbutsu, which means “go  
and see” in Japanese. According to this principle, in order to under-  
stand a situation fully, one needs to go to the ‘real place’—where work  
is done. That means that to start writing for Wikipedia, edit articles on  
topics that are related to your professional qualification and contrib-  
ute to Wikipedia by writing articles that will help other people. Using  
Wikipedia a as source of information about your event is simple if you  
dedicate a little of your time.  
WEBSITES  
Even if you have managed to publish interesting materials in Wikipe-  
dia, your event still needs its own website. Nowadays websites are an  
important tool for potential guests to get in touch with your event. The  
basic rule for designing a good website is closely linked with your abil-  
ity to meet the immediate needs of your visitors. According to research,  
55% of the small businesses use online marketing for events, whereas  
98% use their website to reach customers \(Barnatalent, 2011\). Why do  
they do this? In short, online marketing is less expensive than tradi-  
tional marketing, and although it requires time and creativity, it puts  
small companies on equal ground with larger ones.Marketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 189

Your event must have its own website. You must plan carefully the  
content of the site from a visitor’s point of view. A good starting point  
is to focus on its usability and not its look. In fact, most of websites  
are created with one-way communication in mind. For the most part  
we provide the information our visitors will supposedly find necessary  
and useful, we publish it, then design the layout, and even add pictures  
and graphs, hoping that this will be sufficient. However, your content  
must be planned in such a way so as to take full advantage of all two-  
way communication opportunities available. This means offering visi-  
tors tools to interact with you. In Table 9.1 shows some of the available  
tools, though this does not show all the tools at your disposal.  
According to an article by Tony Haile \(2014\), CEO of Chartbeat, a  
stunning 55% of users spend less than 15 seconds actively on a page,  
which means that it is necessary to create content and a design that  
will attract an average user who will be willing to spend time on your  
website. Haile also states that numerous facts that we have taken for190 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
granted about the web just aren’t true. Haile identifies the three myths  
that should be taken into consideration when planning a web presence.  
The goal is to create content not just for its own sake but that will prove  
useful to your potential guest. It is advisable to be aware of the myths,  
as listed in Figure 9.2.  
Although the mere fact of having shares in social media doesn’t  
mean that people have actually read the content they share, a well-de-  
signed website offers easily shared options. In Table 9.2 you can see the  
most popular sharing buttons available. It will prove useful for you see  
what kind of sharing options your potential guests used most, so as to  
offer them the same choice. As you will see for yourself, including share  
buttons is very easy. Data shows that sharing options creates more traf-  
fic to your website than “like” buttons.  
However, if the content of your website is static, it is not likely to invite  
people to come back again and again. Finding ways to attract attention

visitors tend to be actual news.  
Myth 2\: The more we share, the more we read. Fewer than 100  
likes and fewer than 50 tweets can create engagement with the content.  
Myth 3\: Native advertising is the savior of publishing. On the  
native ad content only 24% of visitors took pains to scroll down the page,  
compared with 71% for normal content \(Native advertising is a form of paid  
media where the ad experience follows the natural form and function of  
the user experience in which it is placed. It frequently manifests as either an  
article or video produced by an advertiser with the specific intent to promote  
a product.\)

time and again is a must. Although it depends on the particular kind of  
event, whose variety is great, we can summarize the following\:  
■ You can encourage visitors to share, setting the goal of  
collecting special prizes.  
■ You can ask visiters to subscribe to watching special videos  
before anyone else.  
■ You can stimulate registration by offering greet and meet  
opportunities.  
■ You can ask visiters to subscribe to receive special materials.  
■ You can promise to share snippets of important information  
on a daily basis, etc.  
The goal here is to plan your content, keeping in mind the fact that  
people need to have a reason to return, and that reason is, doubtless, to  
find something they consider important.  
Thus, everything should be as easy as possible and secure.  
Once people give you their e-mail addresses, use them carefully  
and only for the purpose of sending useful information. As was192 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

already mentioned, your content should be presented in a variety  
of forms; a short video, however, is more likely to grab attention  
than a written text. Your website is your place on the web, and  
using it shrewdly, bearing in mind your visitors’ needs, is of par-  
amount importance. Still, many websites are built for the conve-Marketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 193  
nience of their owners, not of visitors. Provided that everything  
you work hard for is done for the sake of His Majesty, the user,  
even without too many special effects, flashy animations etc., your  
website will be a good place to spend some time.  
BLOGS  
Research has shown that if you can hold a visitor’s attention for just  
three minutes, they are much more likely to return than if you only  
hold them for one minute. Though visitors come to get new content,  
websites, by default, are not created for frequent updates. Many of the  
traditional sections like—for example, about us, contact us, what we  
do—are not subject to daily update. To get around that, many compa-  
nies create company blogs as a place for sharing regular updates and  
insights. Corey Eridon \(2014\) from HubSpot says about business blogs\:  
“Business blogging is a marketing channel that helps support business  
growth. It does that by driving traffic to your website and providing  
opportunities for that traffic to convert in some way”.  
At the heart of business, blogging is the unique opportunity to pro-  
vide a place for conversation between the representatives of the com-  
Table 9.3. Blogging Terminology  
Blog \(noun\)\: a journal or diary that is on the Internet  
Blogger \(noun\)\: a person who keeps a blog  
Blog \(verb\)\: to write a blog  
Blogging \(verb\)\: the action of writing a blog  
Blog category \(noun\)\: categories allowed for a broad grouping of post  
topics  
Labels \(noun\)\: a way to categorize your posts easily. When you’re writing  
a post, click Labels on the side and enter the labels you like, separating them  
with commas.  
Tags \(noun\)\: similar to categories, but they are generally used to describe  
your post in more detail 194 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
pany and the potential or real customers \(between event organizers  
and potential guests\). The smart choice is to use a URL in the following  
format\: blog.eventcompanyname.com/\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \(specific blog title\). By  
doing so, each single blog post becomes a new page of your website and  
search engines will welcome that regular activity.  
The decision to establish a blog has to be taken carefully. In the first  
place, a blog needs regular updates—a new post on a daily or biweekly  
basis. Most professionals agree that companies should publish daily on  
their blogs, yet most do not manage to. Experience proves that publish-  
ing at least twice per week can be effective.  
As with all business activities, your event blog needs to establish  
the right goals. Your next step is to discover what kind of information  
your visitors want that is not currently available on your website. Then  
you have to find the right person or persons from your event team who  
enjoy writing and who will agree to prepare the blog content. Together  
you have to create a list of potential topics as well as some directions  
for where to look for topics. In the beginning you need to fix a sched-  
ule for your blog posts. Visitors like to have some sense of security;  
knowing that they can find a new post every Monday and Thursday,  
for example, will definitely make them feel better. Thus, start with goals  
that are not so ambitious, but focus on the number of posts per week.  
It is better to increase the number of posts while the opposite would be  
bad for your reputation. To grab people’s attention, you have to learn  
how to write catchy headlines as well as present great graphic illustra-  
tions, making this part of your regular practice. A very important step  
is to create a way to measure your success and establish exactly what  
will be accepted as success\: number of visitors, number of comments,  
numbers of shares, numbers of likes, etc. Unless you establish a mea-  
surement system before your start, it will be difficult to know how well  
your blog is going.  
If you are not sure that blogging is for you, consider Figure 9.3.  
It will be quite reasonable of you to consider carefully everything  
that will happen before, during, and after your event as an opportu-Marketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 195  
Figure 9.3. Effective Blog Strategy  
nity to create content for a blog and spread the word about your event  
through the blogging platform. What is more, as data show, daily posts  
are the best choices, yet our advice is you to start with two posts per  
week, allowing you time to adapt to the new channel and to find topics  
for blogging, as well as to encourage other members of your event team  
to start offering topics and even writing posts.  
One of the essential differences between your website and your  
blog is the writing style. In the beginning you will doubtlessly have to  
write and rewrite your posts. Keep in mind that you can write in an  
informal style just as if you are talking to your visitors. Actually, your  
blog is a place for conversations, not for monologues. So a good post  
should inspire readers to share their thoughts with you and for you  
to respond. That’s how the conversation begins. Take time to consider  
precisely your blog categories.  
What does writing a good blog post involve?  
Here are some guidelines to help your blog become an efficient tool for  
the marketing of your event.196 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

Call on Fewer Guest Bloggers and Staff Writers. \(Source\: State of Inbound

1\. The title, stupid. Because your title is the first thing people will  
see, it should be attractive, provocative, attention-grabbing, and  
descriptive. At the same time your title must contain your key-  
words for SEO purposes. It is a well-known fact that the shorter  
the title, the better its impact on the reader. Fifty-five charac-  
ters is a reasonable title length limit in accordance with the new  
design of Google. But consider very carefully where to use capi-  
tal letters. And if you can fit your title in 50 characters, it will be  
even better.  
2\. Fast reading, the need for short text. We live in a world in  
which everything is very fast. People don’t have time to read  
long articles, so divide a long text into many posts, each one no  
longer than 600 words.Marketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 197  
3\. The picture is worth more than a thousand words. Dedicate time  
to finding or making a cool picture. Carefully name the title of  
the picture. You can name the picture after the title of the post.  
4\. Format makes your text easy to read. Include different colors,  
fonts, quotes, tables, etc.  
5\. Categories, labels, tags. These are there to help your visitors  
find what they want in your blog, and they also help search  
engines to “read” your post. Make sure you choose these accu-  
rately bearing your SEO in mind.  
6\. Linking is the key. Use your post to guide readers to previous  
posts or to the content on your website by inserting hyperlinks.  
7\. Description. Use the description as a subtitle whose main goal  
is to make your post attractive to readers, and, of course, repeat  
your keywords.  
8\. A call for action. End your post with something that will make  
people eager to share their thoughts with you. It could be a  
question, a provocation, or an encouragement to share personal  
insight.  
9\. No one is perfect, even you. It is a well-known fact that when  
we write passionately, we often make mistakes. Allow your-  
self time to read your post and edit. Don’t forget that editing is  
absolutely necessary as well as using a spellcheck program.  
10\. Share with the world! You can use systems to share your blog  
post on different social media platforms, but make it a habit to  
make sure your posts are correct.  
There are many ways that you can automatically share your content  
on the Web, and bufferapp.com is just one of them.  
As far as blogs and events are concerned, one should think about  
applying different strategies to cover the event in your blog, as well as to  
get some bloggers who attend your event involved in various activities.198 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
In most cases people want to share where they are and what is  
happening. If you prepare a few posts and schedule them to be  
published every day of your event, adding only new details and photos,  
this will provide your guests with an opportunity to check in regularly  
and to share with their friends and followers in their networks. One  
of the main advantages of blogs is the opportunity to create Internet  
links, and those links make word-of-mouth contact much faster and  
more effective in comparison with traditional forms of publicity. It is,  
in fact, when people trust bloggers that they are inspired to read and  
share interesting information they come across in blogs. Covering  
events in this way helps you to create steady traffic to your site and  
gain credibility. Many of your guests, or at least a few, will write about  
your event in their own blogs. Take care to offer them support, such  
as photo opportunities or access to professional photos, and provide  
them with opportunities for conducting interviews with your keynote  
speaker or event manager. The latter will make their posts better,  
which, eventually, results in effective coverage of all your activities and  
events.  
Furthermore, one shouldn’t forget that 61% of U.S. online consumers  
have made a purchase based on recommendations from a blog, and  
81% of U.S. online consumers trust information and advice from blogs  
\(Liubarets, 2013\). Your blog is the voice of your event or event company  
in the online world. It will create a community of people interested in  
all of your events, rather than only one event.  
PODCASTS  
Having discussed blogs in detail, it’s time to focus our attention on one  
more channel—the podcast. At the begining of the 21st century, the  
term “podcast” was coined from the words iPod and broadcast. As its  
name suggests, its content can be used on mobile devices. In general, a  
podcast is a digital audio \(or video\) file made available on the Internet  
for downloading to a computer or portable media player.Marketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 199  
Table 9.4. Podcast Terminologies  
Podcast \(noun\)\: The content in a single episode. The episode contains a  
digital audio \(video\) file.  
Podcast \(verb\)\: The action of sending the episode’s content out through  
syndication.  
Podcatcher\: A software application that automatically checks podcast feeds  
and automatically downloads new items.  
Punchcast\: A podcast that is sent directly to a smartphone or another  
mobile device, without being sent to a laptop or desktop PC.  
Vodcast\: A video podcast.  
Mobcast\: An audio program that can be received on cell phones or mobile  
devices.  
Juice\: A free program that can automatically download new episodes/  
shows when they become available and can synchronize them with portable  
digital audio players.  
Here are some statistics about podcast users, which are important  
to consider\:  
■ The percentage rate of Americans who have ever listened to an  
audio podcast amounts to 29% overall.  
■ Similarly, 26% of Americans aged 12+ have viewed a video  
podcast.  
■ The podcast audience is significantly more likely to have viewed  
television programming through nontraditional means.  
■ One in four podcast consumers plug their MP3 players or  
smartphones into their car audio system “nearly every day.”  
\(Webster, 2012\)  
Those who listen to podcasts are not as numerous as those who log  
in on their Facebook profile, yet podcast listeners are more focused  
and will dedicate more time and attention. They will listen to your200 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
content for at least 10 minutes. Most podcasts last from 10 to 60 min-  
utes. Imagine what it takes to attract attention for one hour with other  
media.  
Unlike blogs, podcasting is not for everyone because it requires  
more investment in time, technical skills, and content creating. In the  
end it does not attract a huge audience, big traffic, or new business.  
Yet, if you have interesting content to share and a small but enthu-  
siastic group of people willing to listen, it will be worth all efforts. To  
start, what you need most is dedication and some equipment.  
Equipment includes\:  
■ Audio software. There are different choices according to your  
preferences  
■ Microphone  
■ Mixer and audio interfaces  
■ Portable recorder/mobile voice recording  
However, you can start with just a microphone, a computer, and  
some audio software; it all depends on your intentions. Besides the

technical requirements, you need to have good reasons to start your  
event podcast. And, last but not least, be patient when you are trying to  
attract listeners. You have to apply the same strategy for your podcast  
as for blogging.  
First of all, try to learn some of the typical personality traits of your  
event guests in order to create audio \(or video\) content that will grab  
their attention. In most cases interviews with people build better rela-  
tionships within the community. Moreover, you can tape an interview  
via Skype or Google Hangouts. Remember that a lot of people who  
don’t have time to read blogs are willing to spare some time listening  
while commuting, which they are bound to do provided that you offer  
them exciting content. As for events, there is always something to be  
shared before and after the event is over. The podcast, when you get  
used to that format of content, is an easy way to generate guest con-  
tent. People prefer talking to writing, so even the busiest person will be  
able to spare ten minutes for a talk with you. If you are well prepared  
for the interview, you will not need to do much editing. For editing,  
you can always turn to free options, such as Audacity \(http\://audacity.  
sourceforge.net/\), for example. When you have an MP3 file, you need  
just a few minutes to post on your blog, site, Facebook page, G+ page,  
or wherever you want. Last but not least, the audio content can easily  
be transformed into written content with the application of transcrip-  
tion software, such as Express Scribe \(http\://www.nch.com.au/scribe/\).202 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
However, do not forget that you have to proof your transcript before  
posting it on your site.  
Podcasts attract influential listeners. What is more, the human  
voice can have a much greater impact on users in comparison with the  
printed word. As with all tools in marketing, a podcast has some cons  
as well\:  
■ It could be costly to create high-quality audio content.  
■ At the moment all known tools for tracking ROI can’t be applied  
to podcasts.  
■ If you do not create content on a regular basis, you will lose  
your listeners  
■ You may need a dedicated person from your team for production.  
■ To a certain extent preparing content for a podcast requires cre-  
ativity and equipment; as a result, not every person from your  
team will be keen on working on podcast projects.  
If creating audio content is not easy for you, you will find video  
content even more challenging. Like the podcast, a video podcast \(or  
vodcast\) is a regular video installment to broadcast messages about  
your event to the world. The difference is that usually vodcasts are  
shorter, as they are planned to be watched and, generally, people can-  
not spare much time. Optimally, video podcasts should be about two to  
nine minutes long. In addition to this, vodcasts can help you cultivate a  
base of potential guests for your event. All in all, people enjoy watching  
short videos. In a blog post titled “25 Amazing Video Marketing Sta-  
tistics,” we can see the following useful information \(Mincher, 2014\)\:  
■ Videos increase people’s understanding of your product or ser-  
vice by 74%  
■ A third of all online activity is spent watching video  
■ 50% of users watch business-related videos on youtube once a  
weekMarketing with Wikis, Websites, Blogs and Podcasts ² 203  
■ 80% of your online visitors will watch a video, while only 20  
percent will actually read content in its entirety  
The numbers mentioned above prove the importance of video con-  
tent. However, it is very important to make a distinction between a vodcast  
and video content. Thus, if you decide to produce a vodcast, you should  
produce do it on a regular basis, as otherwise you will lose your audience.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Wikis, websites, blogs, podcasts, and vodcasts are just a few of the numer-  
ous opportunities you can take advantage of to generate content and start  
a conversation with your guests. It goes without saying that we cannot be  
everywhere we want. This means that we have to organize our event by  
utilizing the new technologies available, which will help not only to make  
our work easier and faster but will help to establish new expectations  
from us as event organizers. Online users are not patient enough to wait  
for information. They want it at a moment’s notice and in the format that  
they prefer. We need to find out who our potential guests are, where they  
spend their time online, what kind of information they need, and in what  
format they prefer to get that information.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. What is your attitude about Wikipedia articles?  
2\. What kind of information do people look for at event websites?  
3\. What topics do you find convenient to post on an event com-  
pany blog?  
4\. What is the attitude of your peers about audio content?  
TASK  
Produce an audio interview for a podcast of an event company. How will  
you go about the interview? How can you convert the audio content into a204 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
blog post? What is your idea of a suitable title? Think about how this audio  
content can be transformed into a vodcast. What are the differences?

INTRODUCTION  
It was the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in  
London on the 29th of April 2011 that showed to the world for the first  
time how new channels of communication have changed the field of  
special events. The whole world was watching via the official YouTube  
channel online, and people read and wrote comments, sent video mes-  
sages to the couple, and did plenty of others things that made the world  
part of the event.  
Nowadays it’s very difficult to imagine how people lived in the  
past without these new ways of communication. Today no one has the  
patience to wait for the postman to bring the news. We want all infor-  
mation exactly at the moment—the news, the pictures, and the video.  
Social media and social networks have become the essential platform  
for social interactions and a permanent means of communication  
between people. Before going in depth on how to use social media and  
social networks for the success of your planned event, it is important to  
look back at its historical development.  
Of course everything began with the invention of the technology to  
send e-mails. As you will see in Figure 10.1, the time frame between the  
introduction of new social networking technology is getting shorter  
and shorter. In just four years \(2002–2006\) four social networks  
appeared on the landscape, changing not only the way people spend  
their free time, but also how they communicate or decide what to buy,  
which events to attend, and in general, how they conduct themselvesMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions ² 209  
Figure 10.1. The History of Social Networking.  
as citizens. It is indeed a very short period for such significant changes.  
The good news is that in this situation we are all equally unprepared.  
There is no time for research on what is efficient and why, and why peo-  
ple react or do not react to specific messages, images, and incentives.  
While this text is being written, Facebook has, as of June 2015, 968 mil-  
lion daily active users on average, 844 million mobile daily active users  
on average, 1.49 billion monthly active users, and 1.31 billion mobile  
monthly active users \(Facebook, 2015\).  
The average friend count is 190 \(Backstrom, 2013\), and Facebook  
is a terrific absorber of audiences’ time and attention, with 114 billion  
minutes a month in the U.S. alone spent on that network. It is difficult  
to imagine how much time each one of us dedicates to social media  
and networks. Yet we know that we are there, and we communicate  
with friends. That is one of the reasons for many event planners to do  
their best to use social media and social networks in their work\: our210 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
potential guests are there, and if we want to communicate effectively  
with them, we have to be there too.  
SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL NETWORKS  
We get used to using social media and social networks as two terms,  
which seem to be interchangeable. The truth is that they are differ-  
ent, and realizing the difference will help us to use them better for the  
needs of our planned event. According to Social Media Today \(Harts-  
horne, 2010\) the differences between social media and social networks  
are numerous and as vast as the contrast between day and night. We  
can group all significant differences into five major categories\:  
What we do when we use both\:  
Social media\: share information with a large audience  
Social networks\: it’s all about creating relationships  
Communication model  
Social media is a two-way asymmetric model, which means that there  
is a source of information and people who react to that information lik-  
ing, commenting, sharing, etc. However, the source remains the same  
and does not change during to process of communication.  
Social networks are a two-way symmetric model as well, with con-  
versations taking place depending on the topic and various interests.  
In fact, people become engaged. At any time anyone can initiate a new  
conversation.  
We can find one of the simplest explanations of the differences  
between social media and social networks in the blog by Lon S. Cohen  
\(2009\), which explains that “social media can be called a strategy and  
an outlet for broadcasting, while social networking is a tool and a util-  
ity for connecting with others.”Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions ² 211  
Social media and social networks are welcomed by  
the events planner  
Findings from the “Social Media & Events Report 2011” \(Amiando,  
2011\) imply that Facebook and Twitter are the most important social  
media platforms for event organizers. There are different strategies  
for using social media and social networks in planned events, yet if  
we go deep into the strategic management of planned events to see  
the details, we will discover that in most cases new ways of commu-  
nication are used for nearly the same purposes. These purposes are  
as follows\:  
■ Creating anticipation about the event is, in fact, a perfect way  
to share information with potential guests at an early stage of  
the planned process. If used properly, social networks can help  
you spread the news at very low cost.  
■ Enhancing mutual contacts between guests before the event.  
One of the main reasons for people to attend special events is  
to get in touch with new people, to share ideas with similarly  
minded people, in other words, become part of a community.  
With social networks that is easy, and if you succeed in creating  
a community, you will see that your event will last much longer  
in the online world.  
■ Receiving information from guests in advance. An event  
planner sets up the event process by collecting information  
about the needs and expectations of potential guests. Via social  
media and networks we can ask questions, collect opinions,  
and start the conversation with our guests long before the  
event itself, which will provide a unique opportunity to create  
an event that best matches the needs and expectations of our  
guests.  
■ Generating excitement and recreation. Our potential  
guests can be encouraged to participate in quizzes, award  
programs, and such, and there are numerous different ways212 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
to take part in the preparation process and participate in  
spreading the news about our event. It’s not necessary to  
give monetary awards.You can award top places, meet with  
keynote speakers, offer special gifts, etc. What is essential  
is to use the guest’s enthusiasm to generate excitement and  
expectation.  
■ Preparing guests for the event. Sharing the right information  
with potential guests in advance—video with speakers, words of  
welcome, data and any kind of useful information, allows you to  
prepare guests for what to expect during the event. In that way,  
we will not fall into the trap of wrong expectations, which is a  
serious mistake for every event planner.  
■ Prolonging the life of your event. Thanks to social media and  
social networks we can maintain the community created by  
the event until our next event. Those people who are satisfied  
with our last event and actively participate in online discus-  
sions are the best ambassadors for our next event. Keeping the  
community alive is a challenge that event planners have been  
confronting for a long time, but today there are easy ways to  
accomplish it.  
The basic truth about social networks is that, as they are a form  
of engagement, you need to be part of the network before spread-  
ing the news about your event. This means that each event planner  
has to take part in online conversations if they want to use that  
channel for the needs of the events they are planning. You have to  
choose which networks are most suitable for the kind of events you  
work on and invest time to create an effective network of people  
who will be your potential guests one day. Let’s have a closer look  
at some of the most popular sites on the web. Among the most  
important decisions are which networks to use for the particular  
event and how to involve guests in taking part in the process of  
generating content.Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions ² 213  
PRACTICAL USAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA  
AND SOCIAL NETWORKS  
FACEBOOK  
Of course, we will start with the most popular social network at the  
moment of the writing of the book. According to eBiz Facebook has  
900,000,000 estimated unique monthly visitors \(eBizMBA, 2015\).  
That’s a huge number, and among all those 900,000,000 the majority  
of our guests are to be found. As Facebook is changing very often, we  
will not go into detail over the steps in creating events on Facebook.  
The truth is that with the new ways of communication, more and more  
people find new friends as well as new people sharing similar views  
as their own, and they want to gather and organize an event. There  
are currently more than 16 million events created in Facebook each  
month. The majority of those events are offline events, from class-  
mate meetings to political protests. When you decide which social  
network \(or networks\) to choose for your event, it is a good idea to  
search where your potential guests are. Although Facebook is the most  
popular network, sometimes the potential guests of our event can be  
found in quite a different place, such as a less popular network but  
one that attracts people with specific interests. One example is www.  
networkingforprofessionals.com, a business network that combines  
online business networking and real life events.The variety is great,  
but you have to think choose carefully, keeping the purpose of your  
event in mind.  
Since Facebook changes its features frequently, it is helpful to visit  
the page on Facebook containing “How to” advice for the latest updates  
about Facebook. However, whatever the new features are, you have to  
keep in mind some basic rules\:214 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ Start early. The right way is first to set up your personal net-  
work, then create a page for your company and get people to like  
it, and only after that should you get on with creating events on  
behalf of the company. The sooner you start, the better chance  
you will have to build a strong network and spread the news  
about the events to the right people.  
Provided that your event is significant enough or will be  
repeated in time, it will be of vital importance to create a page  
for the event with its name and create events on behalf of the  
page. This will help you to create the community around your  
event and maintain relationships with those who like your  
page.  
■ Fill in all the details about the event. Give users as much  
information as possible during the early stages and add details  
as they become available. Don’t forget to add an event photo.  
\(For detailed information on how to add photos, visit the page\).  
■ Decide on some very important details. Will all guests be able  
to see who is invited and who plans to attend and who chooses  
not to attend? Think carefully, because people may not wish to  
attend an event to which more than 1000 people have already  
refused to come. One of the most popular approaches is to  
show only the guests who will attend, though you have to take a  
decision depending on the event.  
■ Upload photographs. People are attracted by pictures, so don’t  
miss that great opportunity. Make sure that all uploaded photo-  
graphs have arranged copyrights. You can upload pictures con-  
nected with the upcoming event such as keynote speakers, art-  
ists, place, city, billboards, posters, etc. It is best to upload your  
photographs immediately after the event; otherwise somebody  
else may do it. Arrange the photos into albums so they are easy  
to find and share. Write carefully the name of the event and the  
date and add a description. It is a good idea to let people tag  
themselves to some of the pictures, and note not all people will  
want their names on their photographs. Give them the choice.Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions ² 215  
Figure 10.2. Top 10 Most Popular Social Networks . \(Data from eBizMBA  
Rank, http\://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-networking-websites,  
accessed 10/19/2015.\)  
■ Upload video. Video information is a must in today’s communi-  
cation process. People are addicted to motion pictures, and they  
really expect to watch video materials before and after the event.  
You can tape some welcome words by the organizers, a few words  
by participants, a video about the place and many other topics.  
Don’t be afraid to experiment. Post a few statutes before starting  
the invitation process.  
Other suggestions\:  
■ Post links to your official website or blog. Share links with infor-  
mation related to your events.  
■ When the page of your event contains all kinds of information,  
you are ready to send an invitation.216 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ Encourage your guests to invite their friends.  
■ Answer and comment on the questions posted on the event  
wall. That is very important.  
■ And don’t forget that paid advertising is an option here too.  
You can promote your event with targeted advertising on  
Facebook.  
At the time this book is being written, from an event planner’s  
point of view, there are two main downsides of the Facebook event  
application. In the first place, the applications do not offer an oppor-  
tunity to create an event that can be repeated each month, for exam-  
ple. If you have that kind of event, you have to create a new event  
each time and repeat all steps mentioned above, which is easy yet  
time-consuming. Secondly, the application doesn’t support ticket  
sales. When you create an event from your business’s Facebook Page,  
you’ll have the option to add a link to a website where people can buy  
tickets for your event.  
By far Facebook has been the most popular social network in  
the last few years. It is still very crowded, with more than 16 mil-  
lion events created on Facebook each month \(https\://newsroom.  
fb.com/Products/\) competing for the user’s attention every month. If  
you want to manage your event successfully, you have to encourage  
friends to spread the news. That’s what the power of social networks  
is all about.  
LinkedIn  
While this text is being written, LinkedIn is the biggest professional  
network in which people connect based on professional goals. It is  
the place where people look for professional meetings, seminars,  
conventions, training, etc. “Most people use LinkedIn to ‘get to some-  
one’ in order to make a sale, form a partnership, or get a job . . . How-  
ever, it is a tool that is under-utilized” \(Kawasaki, 2011\). LinkedIn  
has currently 259 million active users monthly as of October 2013.Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions According to Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, they “continue to deliver  
value to professionals through investment in core products and strate-  
gic initiatives such as mobile, students and the professional publishing  
platform.”  
Thus, if the main purpose of your event is to meet a professional  
body, LinkedIn is the right place to find your potential guests, though  
it no longer supports the LinkedIn events application. However, there  
are still many ways to spread the word about your upcoming events.  
You can always share links about events from your home page or post  
a discussion in relevant groups. The first thing to do is to create your  
personal profile and establish your network. A reasonable step after  
creating your account is to search for some professional groups in  
LinkedIn related to the topic of your event. Since this is a professional  
network website, the level of communication noise is much lower than  
in Facebook or Twitter, for example. Here people do not receive tons of  
information about events, so your message stands a much better chance  
to be noticed. You have to create a home page for your organization and  
fill it with information before you start to invite people. Think carefully  
how many discussions can be handled in different groups, as people  
will be raising professional questions.  
Due to the professional nature of the users, it is necessary to send  
targeted guests a customized message inviting them to your event. As  
in all computer-based communications, standard messages are not  
the best way to invite people to your unique event. Take some time  
to think about what to write and make sure you tick the box to hide  
recipients’ names on the message in case you send one message to a  
number of people. It is not a good idea to show whom you are inviting  
or show details of people who may not want their profile to be avail-  
able to others.  
Since in 2012 LinkedIn acquired the professional content sharing  
platform SlideShare, you have the opportunity to link your Slideshare  
account and presentation, which is a great way to attract guests.  
² 217 218 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
TWITTER  
Twitter is the most popular microblogging platform. “Twitter is based  
around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept. You say what you’re  
doing in 140 characters or less, and people who are interested in you  
get those updates. If they’re really interested, they get the update as  
a text message on their cell phone,” explains Evan Williams \(2013\),  
co-founder of Twitter. In short, Twitter is an Internet-based service that  
allows people to share short messages \(140 characters, called “tweets”\)  
to everybody willing to listen. Those who want to listen are people who  
follow your account on Twitter. So, as in any social network, if you  
want to use it effectively, you have to start early and set up your net-  
works of followers in Twitter here. The main purpose is to create a solid  
network of people who follow you. To do this, you can start following  
other people who you think are interested in your topic. One important  
term on Twitter is “Twitterfeed”, meaning someone’s tweets. One of the  
viral effects of Twitter is to inspire your network to retweet \(share\) your  
tweet, thus spreading your message to their own network. In that way  
your message gets to far more recipients in the form of a recommen-  
dation by people who have a good reputation in their own network. In  
the planning process of your event, you can use Twitter in each step.  
In fact, we can automatically publish on Twitter from Facebook and  
LinkedIn. Yet that does not make much sense, as you miss the specific  
way of communication each network uses. You can use Twitter in the  
beginning to collect preliminary information. After that, check ideas  
and topics as part of the planning step.  
One of the most popular ways of using Twitter for planned events  
is during the event itself. People share thoughts, quotes, citations, and  
opinions during the event. Those tweets reach guests as well as people  
who are not at your event but are curious to find out what is happen-  
ing there. Many events use Twitter to collect questions to be answered  
during a Q&A session. Actually, this is an opportunity that can open  
up your event to an audience much larger than the guests actually pres-  
ent. Nowadays, it is a must to have a designated person who will send  
tweets while the event is taking place.Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions ² 219  
There are two main reasons why event planners use Twitter\:  
■ Publicity. Twitter enables the word-of-mouth-effect, thus  
generating buzz about the upcoming event;  
■ Two-way communication with guests. This is the fastest way to  
find out about positive and negative experiences, send prompt  
answers, and maintain a community spirit among your guests  
and their friends in the networks.  
In contrast to Facebook and LinkedIn, on Twitter you have no  
more than a five-minute tolerance to answer questions, making it very  
important to plan how you will follow what is happening on Twitter  
as well as to appoint a person who has the competence and skills to  
make decisions quickly, who knows the event well, and can manage  
difficult communication. Never underestimate the power of Twitter to  
ruin your good reputation. What is more, it is fast and easy to use on  
mobile devices.  
Of course, the principle of starting early is essential too. You have  
to create an account. It is advisable to turn the “Protect my Twitter  
updates” off. As in most cases our goal is to gain quality followers,  
establish relationships, and communicate; however, protecting the  
updates box is not a good idea. Twitter’s appeal lies in its open public  
nature.  
You have to decide how to name your account. It could be named  
after yourself, the company, or your event. Yet if your event will be  
happening again in a fixed period of time, it is better to use the event’s  
name. When you do this, you have to start creating your network.  
The first step is to listen and choose whom to follow. Also you can  
search for topics, names, city, etc. Select carefully and think of creating  
a list of possible ways to divide your network into various topics so as  
not send all the news to everyone.  
Twitter has one simple rule\: if you want to answer some tweets, you  
have to start your message with the name of the person to whom you220 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
are responding, for example, @boshnakova. That will show your tweet  
inmediately on that user’s Twitter feed, and he will be able to answer  
you as quickly as possible.  
For an event planner who is using Twitter, it is most important  
to create a hashtag for the event. It is not always easy to know which  
keywords to use in order to find the information you need. It is not  
easy to unite all tweets about your event in one place. At that point  
hashtags come in handy. “The \# symbol, called a hashtag, is used to  
mark keywords or topics in a Tweet. It was created originally by Twitter  
users as a way to categorize messages” \(Twitter, 2013\). You have to use  
a hashtag to mark all tweets relevant to your event. According to the  
unwritten laws of Twitter behavior, the hashtag goes at the end of your  
tweet if it doesn’t fit naturally in the text you are writing.  
While creating your network, you can search for some hashtags  
relevant to your business and see who is using them. Before creating  
the hashtag of your event, make sure it has not been used yet and that it  
is unique. It is a good idea to use the same hashtag for all social media  
and networks you use.  
When creating your hashtag, you have to spread it among mem-  
bers of your team and your potential guests and encourge them to  
use it when tweeting about your event. The only thing that you have  
to do with your hashtag for your event is to let people know about it  
by using it in all your communication channels\: e-mail invitations,  
Facebook pages, Twitter, and other forms of communication with your  
attendances. Of all the social networks Twitter is the one that needs the  
quickest response. So choose carefully when designating who will be  
responsible for tweeting before, during, and after your account.  
Twitter has yet another benefit. Links shared via tweets and  
retweets will add value to your content and will serve as a search engine  
optimization \(SEO\) tool for better search engine results. Think in  
tweeter style and try to share your most important thoughts within 120  
characters. Although Twitter permits 140 characters, it has been provenMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions that 120 charaters give you a better opportunity to be retweeted \(RT\).  
And when thinking about your tweet, do not forget about branding,  
such as by creating a custom background on your Twitter page. This  
will help remind you that simplicity is always the better choice.  
Twitter can be easily integrated into your website, blog, Facebook  
account, LinkedIn account, and so on. Using, for example, Tweetboard  
you can bring your event to your site. In that way you, in fact, convert  
your tweets into an easy-to-follow discussion forum, which is a perfect  
tool for laying the basis of a real involvement with your followers and  
website visitors.  
Twitter is trying hard to become one of the most utilized platforms  
in events and has added some new features. Using Twitpic you can  
share pictures and video on Twitter directly from your phone, which  
is almost in real time. When creating a new event, you can give it any  
name or description you like. Once you’ve added a photo or two to  
the event, it will have a link you can use to share the entire group of  
images with the world. Twitpic enables users to organize their images  
by event, including description, information, and tags for each photo  
in the group.

Different options can help you in using Twitter for your events.  
One of them is TweetMyEvents.com. It is a real-time social media  
event marketing platform for the social web. With this service you  
can promote your events to the world through Twitter, Facebook and  
LinkedIn. Your target market can find about your event and register  
straightaway. Getting started is easy. Simply sign in with your Twitter  
account, register your event and tweet it out. There are no limits to the  
number of events you can display. TweetMyEvents also has a tracking  
counter, so you can constantly monitor your page views in real time.  
In addition, there are other social tools that you should use for your  
event. Let’s look at the latest trends in social media.  
FOURSQUARE  
Did you check in at Foursquare? If you didn’t, please do it now, because  
you need to share with your friends where you are and what advice you  
can give them on their arrival there.  
Foursquare is a location-based social networking website based  
on software for mobile devices. Users check in at venues such as  
restaurants, convention centers, etc. Each check-in awards the userMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions points and sometimes badges. As of September 2013, the company  
reported it had 40 million registered users and over 4.5 billion check-  
ins, with millions more every day \(Foursquare, 2013\). According to one  
of the co-founders, Dennis Crowley, the company doesn’t “want people  
to think of Foursquare as a game. We want people to think of it as a fun  
utility. Game dynamics are the bridge to get the people to use it from  
once a day to three times a day and then two weeks later” \(Guardian,  
2011\).  
² 223  
Although in comparison with other social networks, Foursquare  
has relatively small user base, the ROI \(return on investment\) is worth  
it due to the short-term commitment. Using Foursquare you will have  
one more tool to enhance audience participation in your event.  
To use Foursquare, you first have to set up a new profile that reflects  
the name and details of your event. Your next step is to set up a venue.  
That venue will contain again the details of your event. Foursquare  
allows you to connect your profile with your profiles on Facebook and  
Twitter. What is very important here is to fill in the proper address  
of the venue and your contact information. You have various options  
to choose as category and subcategory, which you should do carefully  
because potential guests will be looking at Foursquare using keywords,  
so you have to be sure that everyone interested in your topic will drop  
by your event. At that point, you can adjust the map to reflect your  
event location accurately and add tags which will help people be more  
informed and get the right information at the right time.  
On Foursquare people gain badges and became mayors of places  
they visit frequently. When you get to know the Foursquare network  
in depth, you will find ways to use badges and mayorships and other  
instruments to enhance involvement and participation in your event.  
Of course, if you have a firm budget, you can negotiate with Foursquare  
and create a custom badge. However, even without a custom badge you  
can give incentives to your mayor, the people with a high number of  
check-ins, or those who check in, for example, at most of your places.  
In addition to tags, you can write tips. Those tips can be used as short224 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
messages to your guests and as an instruction on how to get prizes. Why  
not? It is a good idea to add tips periodically throughout your event and  
use them to give your guests a basis for frequent check-ins and updates.  
Think of Foursquare as an instrument to create fun and amusement  
among your guests. This is a perfect tool for encouraging networking  
and establishing working relationships, which in most cases is one of  
the goals of those attending an event. When you start working on your  
profile here, you will find ways to stimulate participants to add tips too  
and to share their excitement with friends.  
It wouldn’t be any news to you if we remind you that it is a must to  
start early and offer incentives for those who have become your friends  
early on and can help you spread the news about your event.  
As in most cases, your event will be held in a public place where  
many other events have either been carried out or will take place, and  
when your event is over, don’t forget to delete your tips and “flag your  
venue as closed.” That will open the place for the next event that will be  
held at the same venue.  
Checking areas of your event. One of the reasons event planners  
use Foursquare is to register the different location of the event  
as another place and stimulate attendance to register frequently.  
Planners start by adding tips about the location on the way to the  
venue where the event will be held, such as airports, railway stations,  
bus or subway stops, parking areas, main entrances, registration  
desks, halls, buffets, different exhibition halls, etc. You can take the  
opportunity to give incentives to guests and in that way encourage  
them to check in again.  
Early on. In most cases you and your main participants will be  
visiting the event venue many times before the actual event. It is a good  
idea to ask your collegues and keynote speakers or artists to check in  
during that period with the intention of reminding their friends that  
the event is forthcoming. In that way, you will involve participants  
early on and will use their networks to generate interest and attractMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions attendants. Also during the rehearsal you can give tips to your collegues  
and encourage them to share their tips with others.  
Coordination. The Foursquare platform can be an ideal tool to  
coordinate your team\: if people are asked to check in at any different  
locations of your event, everyone will know where they are at any  
moment and can communicate simultaneously with others. The only  
thing that you have to do in advance is ask all your team members to  
register and become friends. The rest is easy and fun.  
Involvement. At the end of your event you can easily track how  
many of your guests have checked in, how many of them have shared  
tips and comments, and which venue or venues were most popular, and  
collect other important information for the evaluation of the event and  
for the next event that you will be planning. Don’t forget that all these  
tips and comments get not only to your guests, but to all friends in the  
network, making it still another means to spread the news about your  
event.  
Sponsorships. This platform opens up new opportunities for  
engaging guests with your event and sponsors. You can organize games  
with check-ins at the sponsor’s venue, have guests collect badges and  
post tips or whatever other ideas you can come up with. People like  
playing games and finding out how to use new technologies. Make the  
best of people’s curiosity.  
FLICKR  
Flickr is a website used for storing, organizing, and sharing photos.  
It is also a fun and easy social networking website, popular with  
photographers and photo lovers. In addition to being a popular site  
for users to share photographs, Flickr is also a place to manage and  
organize photos into albums and categories. The world has come a long  
way in its development, yet it still goes without saying that “a picture  
is worth a thousand words.” As with all social networks, it is import-  
ant not only to create an account but also to establish your networks.  
² 225 226 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
In your work as an event planner, setting up and maintaining Flickr’s  
account will help you to\:  
■ tell your event story with the help of pictures  
■ reach new potential guests and set up an online community  
■ promote your topic and organization with the power of visual  
communication  
■ involve and engage your guests through sharing photos and  
creating groups  
■ acknowledge organizers, sponsors, guests, and partners  
As in all other networks, you have a choice between a free and paid  
account. The free version includes the following\: 1 terabyte of photo  
and video storage; upload of photos of up to 200 MB per photo; upload  
of 1080p HD videos of up to 1 GB each; video playback of up to 3 min-  
utes each; and upload and download in full original quality and unlim-  
ited monthly bandwidth. You can also create groups, which are places  
to share photos related to a particular theme. Any Flickr member can  
create or join one, and, generally, they are a great way to share content  
and start conversations. Groups can either be public, public \(invited  
only\), or completely private. Every group has a pool for photos and/or  
video and a discussion board for talking. There are administrators and  
members. The other great opportunity offered by Flickr is the Photost-  
ream, which allows you to share photos on your web site, blog etc. You  
are not obliged to upload pictures to all your online places, but just to  
create links and use all your pictures from your albums in Flickr. Some  
important things to remember when using Flickr\:  
■ You can upload six individual photos at a time.  
■ Allow time to write titles, tags, and descriptions for your pho-  
tos. Tags will make it easier for more people to find you. People  
often tag pictures with names, locations, event descriptions, and  
themes\: “Sofia,” “Master class,” “Dr. Joe Goldblatt,” and “Confer-  
ence.” It will be better if you add some more information to yourMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions picture, such as “Conference on ‘Social media and networks in  
event management,’ Sofia,” for example.  
■ Integrate your Flickr pictures into your website, blog, or profiles  
in other social networks.  
■ Encourage your attendees to do the same. Create a set within  
your Flickr account to showcase your event photos and share  
them with everyone. This will help you reach a much wider  
audience than if you post them only on your website.  
■ Make sure you have permission to use photos before uploading  
them. This is particularly important when using photos of chil-  
dren, although that goes for any photos with people in them.  
■ Consider publishing your photos under the Creative Com-  
mons License, which is an open access license with few reuse  
restrictions. If you do not want your photos to be reused by oth-  
ers, you have to mark the photos when uploading them; otherwise  
all photos will be licensed as All Rights Reserved. This means that  
no one else but you can use your photos. The permissions you set  
will be displayed under each photo. If you want people to share  
your photos on their blogs or social networking sites, you should  
choose copyright permissions that will allow them to do this.  
■ One of the most significant benefits of Flickr is that when you  
are at an event, the speed of getting up photos online matters.  
Using the Flickr Uploader tool, you can get your images online  
very quickly. The closer to your event you can get your photos  
up, the more likely it is that people will use them to refer to and  
to share with others, helping to drive traffic.  
■ Once your imagery starts being noticed, you will most likely  
receive invitations for permission for your photos to be reused.  
This means your photos are gaining traction. Try to approve the  
requests quickly and encourage more people to use your images  
and credit you accordingly, of course.  
■ Flickr has an excellent tool that allows you to get deeper metrics  
on your photos. With these statistics, you can see which of  
² 227 228 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
your photos have proved to be the most popular or have been  
shared with other people, as well as what sites attract people  
to your photo collections. Don’t forget that pictures from the  
event are essential both for the memories and the engagement  
of your guests. Upload quality pictures during and after the  
event; otherwise guests will upload theirs, which are not always  
of high quality and may not show your event at its best. It is  
not necessary to upload many photos quickly, although prompt  
uploading of some of them is obligatory.  
YouTube  
As far as events are concerned, video content is an indispensable part in  
our contemporary world. People have gotten used to video as a form of  
communication; they insist on receiving video content, and they make  
their own video content and like to share it. Even if you decide not to  
make your own video about the event, it is possible that your guests will  
do it. Thus, you had better make your own video, which means you will  
be in charge and can decide what to show, how to show it, and when to  
broadcast it. Some numbers\:  
■ More than one billion unique users visit YouTube each month.  
■ Over six billion hours of video are watched each month on  
YouTube.  
■ One hundred hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every  
minute. \(YouTube Insights, 2013\)  
Just try to imagine what those numbers mean about the way we  
communicate today. You should consider how to use the video to show  
your event to its best advantage. It is important to know that 25% of  
YouTube’s total watch time is on mobile devices, so make your video  
suitable for mobile devices. It is at this point that the effect of the net-  
work can be used for your event. People like to share exciting videos;  
that’s why you have to offer them good videos. You can make a video  
announcing your event, share videos from your event, and use videosMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions from past events to attract visitors to your website or blog, and you  
may be able to use it for your next event also. Think of the success  
of TEDTalks, which are videos recorded during TED conferences and  
TEDx conferences and which attract millions of viewers and gener-  
ate interest in the conferences. The numbers prove how important it is  
to communicate via video. According to the site statistics\: 50% of the  
users talk to friends after watching a video and 38% share videos in an  
additional social network after watching them on YouTube. Video is a  
powerful tool that event planners should use to reach their goals \(You-  
Tube Insights, 2013\).  
Benefits of using YouTube\:  
■ You can count your audience on the website.  
■ You can use it to store videos.  
■ You can make your own channel.  
■ You can easily share your video with other websites, blogs,  
social media and social networks.  
■ You can generate traffic to your event online places.  
Some people think that all videos for their event should be made  
by professionals on YouTube, which is far from the truth. A successful  
video contains useful information combined with high quality visuals.  
So think visually and try to broadcast your event’s purpose, speakers,  
atmosphere, and all that you consider helpful in reaching your goals.  
Videos should be emotionally engaging and need not be necessarily  
perfect from a productional point of view. All in all, to make successful  
video content you have to think first about making an emotionally  
engaging video from the point of view of guests. An involving video  
is the one that will provide an answer to the most important question\:  
Why should I come to this event? There are plenty of events and only  
24 hours a day. So any potential guest will have to choose between your  
event and a wide range of others. Give the right answer, and they will  
come to your event. If they miss your event, show them what they have  
missed. After the event, make them regret not coming on that occasion  
² 229 230 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
by making a video from the event, one that will help you maintain your  
community and will be useful for your next event. However you can,  
use other opportunities on YouTube.  
In your introduction video you can call for action through the  
pop-up footer banner that appears for 10 seconds into the video and 10  
seconds before the end. This banner is clickable and can direct viewers  
to your website. A video can be a perfect promotional tool, and you  
should use it to encourage your followers to share it on the web.  
You can start your videos before the event—with interviews of  
speakers, artists, and partners. You can show people what happens  
before the event or behind the scenes, as well as many other interesting  
facts. Think as TV producers do; there is always something interesting  
that’s going on. Catch the right moments and share them with the rest  
of the world.  
Your video content is an efficient tool for your PR activities too,  
thus many bloggers and online media can use it when writing about  
your event.  
A video from your event can help you in two other ways\: first, it  
could be helpful in attracting new sponsors to your next event. You  
could include a DVD with videos in your sponsorship offers, which in  
most cases has a much greater impact than written words. That is, in  
fact, a perfect way to give people an idea of an event. Secondly, your  
partners and sponsors can use it in their online communication to  
spread the information to a broader audience.  
“Rather than using the standard \(and fairly restrictive\) YouTube  
license, the Creative Commons license allows users to offer other  
people permission to use their videos, as long as they link back to the  
source. With YouTube’s video editor, users can now splice their own  
videos with others’ content, provided that it’s available within Creative  
Commons. These remixes will display an attribution link within the  
video’s ‘more’ description, but YouTube says that they will make the  
links more prominent if people aren’t clicking on them” \(Bazilian, 2011\).Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions Using the “call-to-overlay” function you can combine your video  
with a link, for example, a link to your external website or to an  
online event registration website, where participants can buy tickets  
for your events. The short notice pops up when your video starts to  
play.  
It is great idea to use the “Event Dates” module through which you  
can list all your event dates and share the complete information of your  
event on your YouTube channel and give links for tickets online, for  
example.  
To sum up, creating and uploading a video is the first step. As  
with all networks, you should come up with a relevant and catchy  
title, add a URL and a clear, engaging Call-to-Action \(CTA\) to the  
description box. Consider adding a video overlay that links to your  
landing page for greater ROI and share it with all your networks,  
sites, blogs, etc.  
SlideShare  
In 2012 LinkedIn acquired the professional content-sharing platform  
SlideShare. That fact created more opportunities for your shared  
presentations. Slideshare is still the place where people expect to  
see presentations from your event. However, you can use Slideshare  
not only after your event\: it is a great place to upload interesting  
information with the goal of attracting people to your event. You can  
make an exciting presentation of your event, or share past presentations  
with speakers, making them more popular before the event. There are  
speakers who upload their presentations before the event chiefly to get  
feedback from people on what they expect to hear during the actual  
presentation during the event. Of course, you may think that when you  
have photos, videos, and text, why do anything else? People are used to  
presentations. They want to have them or at least access them online.  
So share your content visually by uploading presentations before and  
after the event.

Figure 10.5. SlideShare Quick Facts \(Source\: http\://www.slideshare.net/  
about 27.12.2013\).  
Another reason to do this is that you can reach people who,  
otherwise, will not visit your website, blog, or profile in social networks.  
You can use LeadShare, which allows you to leverage your content by  
capturing the viewer’s contact information \(http\://www.slideshare.net/  
SlideShareHelp/leadshare\) or Send Tracker, which allows you to send  
a link to a contact and get notified when that person opens the e-mail  
and clicks on the presentation. It highlights a summary of all activities  
and provides links to detailed reports on each generated tracker. How-  
ever, those services are paid services.  
Now it is possibe to syncronize MP3 audio with slides to create a  
webinar. This is a great opportunity to present your events, the speakers,  
the topic, etc. It is free and you need little time to get used to do it.  
The next opportunity is to embed YouTube videos inside presentations  
uploaded on Slideshare. Of course, there are other paid options, such as  
branded channels, analytics, ad free pages, and many more.  
Google+  
At the end of 2013 G+ was not far behind Facebook at just over 50%  
users globally. We have to keep in mind that a Google+ account is  
mandatory whenever you create a new Gmail account. This has been  
pushing up the account ownership stats. No other social network has  
Google’s web assets leverage. Besides, there were many new features  
keeping the social networks alive and competitive with the marketplace.  
Google has been integrated into almost all of the other Google web  
services. In fact, that is the situation with events. The idea is to makeMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions it easy to schedule events and keep track of details \(attendees, photos,  
etc.\). Among the benefits worth mentioning are the following\: \(http\://  
www.google.com/+/learnmore/events/\#\)\:  
■ All your Google+ Events appear in your Google Calendar.  
When replying or creating an event in Google+, you can check  
your Google Calendar schedule right from the event to see if  
you have a conflict.  
■ Easy e-mail reminders are automated reminders that are sent  
out to your confirmed guest list, along with an update when the  
event is starting.  
■ With Google+ Events, everybody attending the event can share  
their photos in a single photo collection; as a result, photos  
aren’t scattered across different websites, albums, and e-mail  
attachments as they used to be in the past.  
■ Party Mode allows you to share pictures and videos you take  
during an event instantly with everyone at the event, and with  
the Google+ Android app installed, you’ll have the option to  
turn on Party Mode when an event you’re attending begins.  
■ Get the right look of the occasion with animated event themes,  
or give your invite a personal touch by adding a picture from  
your phone, computer, or one of your Google+ albums.  
With “Google+ Hangout” you can plan a group video call with your  
partners by selecting the option when you create an event. Everyone  
will be reminded to join the Hangout when the scheduled time comes  
around and you can talk face to face. However, it is possible to use it for  
marketing or take advantage of the “On Air” option to broadcast your  
Hangout publicly and record it for sharing later.  
Actually, the influence of Google+ on search results is serious  
enough to prove that it is a platform one cannot afford to ignore. With  
just a few clicks you can fill in the information about your event and  
link to the event registration page where attendees can purchase tick-  
ets. And last but not least, you can use Social Analytics to gain insight  
² 233 234 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
into offsite activities involved in your Google+ Event. That information  
is very helpful for your next event, as you can see which activity and  
content had the greatest impact.  
Instagram  
The sale of Instagram to Facebook in 2012 was the ultimate Silicon  
Valley fairy tale. By 2013 the Instagram community had grown to  
over 150 million people. That same year the network introduced the  
opportunity to share video. Using the mobile application you can take  
up to fifteen seconds of video and share it with your friends. When you  
post a video, you can select your favorite scene as your cover image, so  
your videos can be appealing even when they’re not being played. From  
Instagram you can share your photos and videos easily with Facebook,  
Twitter, Tumblr, etc. Moreover, celebrities and brands quickly latched  
onto the new feature, such as pop star Justin Bieber who became the first  
Instagram user to earn one million “likes” on a video post \(Hernandez,  
2013\). We are well aware of the fact that people like images, and the  
ways we can use Instagram for our events are boundless, limited only  
by our imagination. However, one must never ignore the importance of  
the hashtag, which makes all our photos and videos accessible to other  
people, just as our guests can share their own pictures with us and the  
whole community, thanks to the hashtag. Many people prefer to share  
their emotions through Instagram because it is fast and user-friendly.  
In practice event organizers use Instagram for\:  
■ creating anticipation\: by photos, quotes, short video announce-  
ments  
■ sharing about the event\: real-time information from the room  
■ sharing behind the scenes\: everyone is interested in what is  
happening out of sight  
■ organizing competitions\: guests like to participate in fun  
activities, especially if they are easy and quick  
■ follow-up comments\: short videos from participants.Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions As with all social media and networks, you should communicate  
effectively and promptly on the hashtag of your event.  
If you want to go deeper into Instagram, you can have a look at  
printstagr.am, a website where you can print selected pictures from  
Instagram. Also, Eventstagr.am is a photo curation platform with  
which you can curate event photos shared on the Instagram social  
network in real time quickly and easily. Fully customizable, Eventstagr.  
am collects and displays event photos based on the use of an event-  
wide hashtag. Participants simply tag their Instagram photos on this  
hashtag, and Eventstagr.am is activated, collecting and curating user-  
submitted photos and videos into a clean multimedia display. In fact,  
you can display the photo stream using a projector or TV screen and  
watch.  
² 235  
Pinterest  
When you open the website, you will read “Pinterest is a tool for  
collecting and organizing things you love.” That sounds great for  
any event. Pinterest has over 70 million users and is steadily gaining  
momentum outside the U.S. Another interesting fact worth mention-  
ing is that nearly 80% of users are women, and 35% access it only from  
mobile devices \(Smith, 2013\). Being one of the latest platforms, the  
ways we can use it for events are still to be discovered. Meanwhile, we  
can share some of those which work well in practice. Pinterest is a con-  
venient tool for  
■ collecting ideas for your next event\: There are a lot of pinboards  
with pictures from events, publications, and other inspirational  
information.  
■ crowsourcing ideas for events\: You just need to create a pinboard  
and invite people to share their insights with you.  
■ selling your event to guests, sponsors, and stakeholders\:  
Visualization is always a great way to present your ideas and  
prospects.236 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
■ collecting and sharing the content from your events by means  
of an event organizer or by guests invited to pin photos with  
highlights of the event.  
■ creating a place for follow-up\: collecting all links with feedback  
from the event in one place.  
■ generating traffic to your website, blog or other content  
online.  
Of course, we can use it for self-promotion, as it offers great visual  
opportunities as well as sharing links. It is a good idea to pin all those  
opportunities and look for more.  
MySpace  
If you plan a social or pop culture event, it will not be reasonable to  
skip MySpace as a platform. Just as with all other social media and  
social networks, you have to start early on and create your network.  
In the middle of 2013 Justin Timberlake, who acquired, together with  
his partners, Chris and Tim Vanderhook, the site for \$35 million,  
Figure 10.6. Number of Active Users of Socia Networks Worldwide \(data  
from http\://www.statista.com\) Meeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions introduced a revamped site with a musical focus. Although the new  
design does not have an application for events yet, it is forthcoming.  
The site has been redesigned to focus exclusively on music, so if  
you are into music events, you have to watch out for new developments  
on MySpace to grab the new features about events as soon as they are  
introduced.  
As we have already mentioned, it is not possible to make a compre-  
hensive analysis of all social media and networks. Not being able to go  
deep into details, we are aware that changes are underway every single  
day and that technology is evolving so quickly that we can hardly keep  
pace and manage to study it. We cannot but agree with Sir Ken Robinson  
who said,  
“It is an interesting feature of cultural change that for a period  
of time, new technologies tend to be used to do the same old thing”  
\(Robinson, 2001\). What we can do is to watch carefully for all changes  
and try to use them creatively to make our guests’ experience better.  
How to measure your success in social media  
and social networks  
It goes without saying that measuring your sucess in social media is  
top priority. Although social media and social networks may look like  
free communication channels, in fact they require a lot of time, creative  
ideas, and dedication. So anyone who uses them for business purposes  
is interested to see the results. Those channels are still very young, and  
it is difficult to talk about standards in social media and social network  
measurement and evaluation. However, their digital nature facilitates  
checking progress in achieving one’s goals. Figure 10.7 shows the top  
20 free tools by which you can measure and evaluate your work. Be  
prepared to spend enough time on evaluation because that is the only  
way to be sure what to do in social media and networks for your next  
event. It has already been mentioned that those tools are not fixed; new  
tools will emerge as specialists are working out the standards in the  
measurement of those activities.  
² 237 238 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 10.7. Free Social Media Analytics Tools  
One important aspect of social media and social networks that  
must be kept in mind is that people visit those channels because they  
need to communicate; they want a conversation with you as presentor  
of your event. Real success means not just starting a conversation but  
being able to maintain it as well. It is only then that you have achieved  
a real long-lasting success, which, however, must be measured and  
defined by your objectives. So from the very beginning you have to be  
convinced in what exactly you want to achieve for your event by using  
social media and social networks. In the end we would like to finish  
with a quotation by Albert Einstein, who said, “Not everything that  
counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”  
It is necessary to measure and evaluate your success in social media and  
social networks, but you also have to remember that the most valuable  
asset is the community you create, and your success will depend on  
your ability to keep that community alive until your next event, repeat-  
ing it again and again after each planned event you have done.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Since 2004, when Facebook was initially launched, social media and  
networks have not only transformed the way we communicate, but alsoMeeting and Event Social Media and Network Technology Solutions the way we make decisions and spend our time with friends, the way we  
do business, and last but not least, the way we organize special events.  
We know for certain that those changes are here to stay and more will  
follow. We cannot possibly foresee what will come next, but we can  
accept the changing paradigm and the fact that if we want to be good in  
what we are doing, we have to change every single day. It is not possible  
to be in all social sites, and it is not necessary. What we can be cer-  
tain of is that people are using mobile devices more and more and that  
they prefer video content and want everything to happen fast and to be  
online. We can adapt to that situation and anticipate the next challenge.

243 244 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
INTRODUCTION  
It is never an overstatement to say that “mobile applications” are the  
present of technology in many businesses and many countries. The  
photo below is representative of the adoption of mobile devices by  
people with all levels of technological background. The meeting and  
event industry is not an exception to this statement. The explosion of  
affordable and powerful smartphones with faster wireless broadband  
is accelerating the mobile applications market. Consumers are getting  
used to improved capability of their devices through many useful apps.  
Current mobile apps provide enhanced features plus mobility, which  
once only desktop-based applications could have provided.  
It is important to note that, actually, software developed for mobile  
phones had been around for over a decade before the term “app” was  
popularized by general consumers. The Apple App Store was con-  
sidered the first app store; it allowed people to search and purchase  
applications easily, and it was the first to provide a platform for app  
developers to sell their applications with a simple process.

Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.\) Mobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 245  
It was recorded that 10 million apps were downloaded within its  
first week of operation. Android and iOS \(Apple\) have their own app  
stores, and other smartphone manufacturers are also operating their  
own application stores now. In 2015, it is projected that smartphones  
will constitute over 70 percent of the overall sales in mobile handset.  
According to a research report from the analyst firm Berg Insight, the  
number of mobile application downloads wordwide reached 60.1 bil-  
lion and annual downloads will reach 108 billion by 2017. It is expected  
that iOS and Android combined will serve over 62 percent of total app  
downloads. Windows phone operating system is projected to be the  
third most popular application platform in 2015 \(Berg Insight, 2013\).  
Mobile application is a global phenomenon. The report estimates  
that revenues from paid applications and in-app ad revenues reached €  
6.4 billion in Europe in 2012 and expects it to grow €14.1 billion at an  
annual growth rate of 17 percent. Third-party app stores are especially  
popular in China and other markets where Google Play hasn’t become  
the default on-device app store The Android platform, the second larg-  
est platform, generated € 80 million in 2010. It is forecasted to grow to  
€ 1.5 billion in 2015. The following Figure 11.1 shows the changes in  
mobile apps download over years.

UNDERSTANDING NEW PARADIGMS IN  
TECHNOLOGY-BASED MARKETING  
Internet Marketing, E-Marketing, and Digital  
Marketing\: What Is the difference?  
Many business professionals especially, small business owners such  
as event management organizations, hear about these new technolo-  
gy-based marketing tools. However, many of them do not have formal  
education in marketing or technology-enhanced marketing. Answering  
this question and helping meeting and event planners to gain knowledge  
should be approached to explain the scope of each marketing tool and  
how to make the most of each tool to maximize marketing outcomes.  
Various terms related to technology-based marketing have been  
used. They include Internet marketing, digital marketing, and mobile  
marketing. According to the Google Trends report \(2015\) by search  
terms \(Figure 11.2\) , there is a clear change over the last decade. Inter-  
net marketing was the most searched term till 2013, but digital market-  
ing took over the spot, and the number of times it has been searched  
has drastically increased since then. Therefore it is critical to under-  
stand each concept and scope.  
Figure 11.2. Web Search Interest\: Internet Marketing, Emarketing, Digital  
Marketing\: Worldwide \(Data Source\: Google Trends \[www.google.com/  
trends\]\). Mobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 247  
Internet marketing is defined as advertising and marketing  
efforts that use the Web and e-mail to drive direct sales via elec-  
tronic commerce by Beal \(n.d.\). Internet marketing includes spe-  
cialized areas such as Web marketing, e-mail marketing and social  
media marketing \(Beal, n.d.\). Internet marketing also used to be  
listed in top in Google search, known as search engine marketing.  
However, the scope of Internet marketing does not take full advan-  
tage of broader and more powerful digital media. Therefore, for  
Internet marketing to be successful, it is recommended that it be  
integrated with digital media as well as with traditional media such  
as print, TV, and direct mail.  
E-marketing may be often interchangeably used with Internet  
marketing and digital marketing in many industries. However, e-mar-  
keting is considered to have a broader scope than Internet marketing  
since it utilizes various digital media, including website, e-mail, and  
wireless media. It also provides digital customer data and electronic  
customer relationship management systems \(Chaffey, 2013\). These  
techniques are used to acquire new customers and provide requested  
services to existing customers to achieve customer relationships.  
Today’s customers are multigenerational and have distinctive differ-  
ences in the ways they obtain product information. Therefore, it is  
very critical to combine market channels that result in acquiring new  
customers and retaining existing customers. This is the most effective  
marketing system\: to use a combination of digital and traditional  
channels in customer communication and product distributions.  
This is called multi-channel marketing, and its concept is well sum-  
marized in the following Figure 11.3, developed by Chaffey \(2013\).  
Digital marketing is a term increasingly used by specialist dig-  
ital marketing agencies and the new media trade publications. To  
help explain the scope and approaches used for digital marketing  
and how digital marketing needs to be closely aligned to broader  
marketing objectives and activities, details of digital marketing are  
shared here. Digital marketing is a term that has gained popularity  
since 2013, according to the Google trend search \(as seen in Figure248 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 11.3. Multi-Channel Marketing \(Adapted from Chaffey, 2013\)  
11.2\). While there are multiple definitions from different sources, a  
simple version of its definition is probably this one, from the Digi-  
tal Marketing Institute \(http\://digitalmarketinginstitute.com\)\: “Dig-  
ital marketing is the use of digital channels to promote or market  
product and services to consumers and businesses.” Due to its use  
of the general term “digital channels” and scope of its channels,  
digital marketing is considered an umbrella term for many types of  
technology-based marketing. Its utilized digital channels include  
e-mail marketing, search marketing, social media, online PR, video  
advertising, infographic, affiliate marketing, and display advertising  
\(Chaffey, 2013\). No matter which specific channel or a combination  
of multiples is utilized, it is critical to adopt a targeted, measurable,  
and interactive approach.  
As digital marketing involves many online channels \(web, e-mail,  
database, and mobile/wireless devices\), still many consumers or small  
businesses interchangeably use it with online marketing. Chaffey \(2013\)  
argued that digital marketing is a shift from product-focused market-  
ing to customer-centric marketing because it utilizes tailored combina-  
tion of channels based on customers’ profiles created by research. As aMobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 249  
result, digital marketing can provide more effective marketing tools to  
meet customers’ needs.  
MOBILE MARKETING \(M-MARKETING\)  
Mobile marketing is evolving fast and is rapidly becoming a major com-  
munications channel for reaching today’s customers. Its growth is fueled  
by the explosive increase in the number of mobile users and the number  
has already surpassed the number of global laptop users in 2014 \(See Fig.  
11.4\). Mobile marketing utilizes mobile devices as the channel of mar-  
keting. According to Mobile Marketing Association, a broader scope of  
mobile marketing includes advertising, apps, messaging, m-commerce,  
and customer relationship management on all mobile devices, includ-  
ing smartphones and tablets \(http\://www.mmaglobal.com/about\). Due  
to the nature of mobile phones—the most direct and personal chan-  
nel—mobile marketing is often considered consumer-initiated because  
it requires the consent of consumers to receive future communications.

sight, 2015\) 250 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 11.5. Mobile Poll \(Source\: Crowdcompass, 2012\)  
In addition, m-marketing can provide customers with time-specific and  
location-based information that can lead to impulsive purchases due to  
mobile devices’ 24/7 access and mobility.  
The following facts about mobile marketing can provide a grasp of  
the fast developing technology-based marketing channel.  
■ 91% of all US citizens have their mobile devices within reach  
24/7 \(Crowdcompass, 2012\).  
■ 84% say they couldn’t goes single day without their mobile  
devices \(Crowdcompass, 2012\)  
■ People look at every text message they get and they do so within  
15 minutes \(http\://www.strategicgrowthconcepts.com/market-  
ing/mobile-marketing.html\).  
■ Mobile digital time in the US is significantly higher at 51%  
compared to desktop time \(42%\) \(KPCB Mobile Technology  
Trends, 2015\).  
■ 80% of Internet users own a smartphone \(SmartInsights,  
2015\).Mobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 251  
■ Within five years, half of today’s smartphone users will be using  
mobile wallets as their preferred payments method \(Carlisle &  
Gallagher Consulting Group, 2012\)  
■ 25% of international media and marketing executives see  
mobile as the most disruptive force in their industry \(AdMedia  
Partners, 2013\)  
Significant advantages of using mobile-marketing include its per-  
sonal, meaningful, and long-lasting communication with customers  
that leads to being engaged with brands and improving relationship  
with customers \(Powell, 2010\).  
In summary, the question of why companies have to consider  
mobile marketing can be answered as follows\:  
1\) Internet is mostly used via mobile\: According to Forrester  
Research World Mobile and Smartphone Adoption Forecast  
\(2014\), about a fifth of the world’s mobile subscribers are cur-  
rently using their mobile handsets to go online, and mobile  
Internet users will exceed PC-based Internet users in 2016.  
Low-cost data plans will allow many consumers who have not  
been able to go online to access the Internet.  
2\) Mobile marketing is effective\: While mobile marketing won’t  
replace all other marketing channels, it enhances other chan-  
nels. Combined with traditional channels \(print, TV, radio,  
direct mail, e-mail\) and other channels, mobile marketing will  
expand the range and track the effectiveness of those channels.  
Mobile marketing is most effective when utilized as a complement  
to the marketing mix in conjunction with your standard marketing  
media.  
CHALLENGES FACING M-MARKETING  
Concern about the security of sharing financial information over a  
mobile device was reported as one of drawbacks, and about 25% of252 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Figure 11.6. Reasons of Resistance to the M-Commerce Experience  
\(Source\: UPS Pulse of Online Shopper, 2014\).  
respondents said that the check-out process via mobile is too bother-  
some \(UPS Pulse of Online Shopper, 2014\). Figure 11.6 shows the rea-  
sons that e-commerce shoppers are still resistant to the m-commerce  
experience. It is reported that more than 50% of consumers prefer  
online shopping, but they haven’t converted to mobile purchasing yet.  
Almost half of the consumers surveyed said they will forego making a  
purchase on their mobile device and use a PC instead, because the prod-  
uct image isn’t large or clear enough. About a third of the respondents  
said product information isn’t large enough on mobile shopping apps,  
and 3 in 10 said comparing products was frustrating on a mobile device.  
It is important to note that m-marketing can be a stand-alone marketing  
channel; however, a better chance of maximum outcome exists when  
m-marketing is utilized as one channel of a multi-channel marketing  
approach as it will be better suited to customers’ individual needs.  
TRENDS IN MEETING AND EVENT MANAGEMENT  
MOBILE APPLICATIONS  
As discussed earlier in this chapter, marketing has been transformed by  
the Internet and related technologies. This transformation has allowedMobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 253  
marketers to move from product-centric to customer-centric mar-  
keting. Therefore, the meeting and event industry is also shifting its  
marketing focus from offline advertising to personalize digital mobile  
marketing. Several chapters in this book have touched on the adop-  
tion of mobile apps in many different event and meeting management  
functions, including event floor design, registration, virtual meetings,  
and more. More and more meeting and event attendees are adopting  
event mobile applications because of their convenience and mobility.  
With wireless broadband enabling them, many mobile applications  
are being developed using mobile phones and other handheld devices,  
which will have direct meeting applications. For example EventMobi™  
has moved all event management functions into mobile apps. It allows  
both meeting and event planners to access key information in real  
time with the convenience of mobility during attendance meetings and  
events. Log-On \(www.log-on.nl\) uses mobile phones to provide a range  
of tradeshow and event applications for attendees, including confer-  
ence agendas, exhibit product directories, event feedback and surveys,  
SMS audience polling, group announcements, networking capabilities,  
travel information, and more.  
The meetings and events industry was highly social, mobile, and  
collaborative in its nature even before the mobile and social media  
technology began to rule the business world. These characteris-  
tics are ideally suited for the benefit from m-marketing. The use of  
wireless media provides an array of technologies to choose from, but  
the always-on, always-connected personal communication channel  
mobile devices can be a game changer in the meeting and event indus-  
try. To event and meeting professionals, the mobile device can be a  
new and powerful channel to get in touch with event prospects as it is  
in their palms most of the time; some people have their smartphones  
next to them 24/7. However, many meeting and event professionals  
do not possess advanced knowledge or the skill sets to develop mobile  
marketing strategy or create mobile marketing apps yet. Creating and  
managing a mobile-marketing strategy may seem overwhelming for  
meeting and event planners who are already responsible for many254 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
planning responsibilities, especially if a firm is a small business and  
has no marketing or mobile technology expert available. The good  
news is that cloud and mobile innovations can help even the most  
inexperienced meeting and event professionals implement a success-  
ful mobile marketing strategy on an affordable budget. Therefore, it  
is suggested to benchmark other business disciplines and how they  
adopt and implement m-marketing to increase their sales and aware-  
ness of their products and services.  
Practical m-marketing strategy for meeting  
and event organizations  
Getting the prospective attendees to visit your event site is a first step.  
The event page should be engaging enough to make a reservation or at  
least to revisit easily for more information later. Meeting and event pro-  
fessionals often make the mistake of not considering the uniqueness of  
mobile phones. For example, information developed for PC viewing  
may use fonts that are too small or which have too much text for view-  
ing on mobile devices. It is critical to consider the mobile user who has  
a small screen. Here are some tips for developing appropriate content  
for mobile devices\:  
■ Start with analyzing your website. Some of the key areas to con-  
sider include a\) the text\: If the text heavy, it may strain mobile  
users’ eyes and patience, b\) buttons may be hard to find or too  
small for mobile users to use, and c\) event information should  
be easy to find so attendees aren’t frustrated with the search.  
Upon these evaluations make necessary adjustments to  
accommodate prospective attendees who will access meet-  
ing and event information via their mobile devices and make  
reservations.  
■ Think small screen first for e-mail\: E-mails are a powerful tool  
that can increase revenue by 28 percent. They also include pow-  
erful analytics, so meeting and event professionals can under-  
stand which marketing campaigns are working and why. MuchMobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 255  
like the website development tips above, consider small screen  
first, with easy-to-click links.  
■ Think of blogs as your mobile-chat platform\: Blogs are a great  
way to connect with attendees before, during, and after an  
event or meeting, engage in conversations, and offer relevant  
information. Seventy-one percent of people read blogs on their  
mobile devices, so make blogs mobile friendly. An additional  
benefit of readable blogs is that they can even give your search  
engine optimization \(SEO\) strategy a boost, as search is priori-  
tized by readability.  
■ Adopt a holistic mobile strategy\: Only nine percent of the top  
online retailers are using responsive design, which ensures  
business messages and accompanying fonts, graphics, buttons,  
and links are designed for small screens. Successful businesses  
will adopt strategies that specifically cater to mobile users.  
■ Pivot faster with the help of the cloud\: Cloud can help meet-  
ing and event organizers create marketing campaigns, conduct  
testing to determine effectiveness, make changes in subject  
lines, and alter websites almost instantly. M-marketing can be  
especially benefited by cloud technology\: responsive-design  
templates “made for the mobile screen” are built into products,  
from e-mail marketing software to web design software. This  
flexibility and adaptability will help event and meeting profes-  
sionals be updated with the fast advancing mobile technology  
and meet planners and attendees’ requests.  
The mobile market is a terrific opportunity for many event and  
meeting organizers. The main focus should be on how to plan your  
event content according to what prospective attendees consider  
important. The event content should be presented in a variety of forms.  
With the right tools toward the right target attendees, meeting and  
event organizers can realize an immense attendee increase and reve-  
nue boost plus establish ongoing connections with potential repeating  
attendees.256 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
What is in m-marketing for the meeting  
and event industry?  
It is a fact that the details of an event and a meeting can often change  
until the event is over, so finding ways to deliver and attract people’s  
attention over time is critical in event marketing. An event market-  
er’s dream must be to constantly engage with prospective attendees in  
meaningful two-way conversations. Mobile is close to being the dream  
marketing channel because it provide a direct line of communication  
with customers. For attendees mobile provides them access to events  
at any time, wherever they are. M-marketing can help planners reach  
prospective attendees via their mobile phones/smartphones—which  
are now the most used tools to research and search information for  
products and services, including via text message, Smartcode \(2D\),  
proximity Bluetooth advertising, and location-based social media  
\(LBSM\).  
Corbin Ball, who is a meeting and event technology consultant,  
has projected “Twelve Technology Trends in the Meetings and Events  
Market” \(Ball, 2014\). He pointed out that event marketers will have the  
ability to market inexpensively to targeted audiences using multi-me-  
dia based blogs \(online journals\) and RSS \(really simple syndication\)  
newsfeeds.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
Mobile apps have deeply shifted the way customers in the meeting and  
event industry gather information, learn about events, and participate  
as attendees. Event marketers and planners need to effectively leverage  
mobile event apps to elevate the event experience—from the moment  
event registration opens to the last attendee returning home. Mobile  
marketing will add innovative and effective marketing for conferences,  
meetings, conventions, trade shows, and events with appropriate app  
development, which will result in a better event experience. No lon-  
ger just a trend, this new standard—mobile marketing—means that  
planners need to be aware of mobile applications and how to developMobile Applications for Meeting and Event Marketing ² 257  
mobile event marketing to reach and attract attendees. Event market-  
ing requires a holistic digital marketing approach that includes e-mail,  
website, and mobile marketing with consideration of design. To help  
event planners make sure that mobile marketing is aligned with the  
growing meeting business, it is important that they develop a market-  
ing strategy that includes how to achieve growth through e-marketing.  
Employment in advertising, marketing, and public relations is  
expected to grow 13 percent through 2022, according to the Bureau  
of Labor Statistics \(1984\). For students who are studying meeting and  
event management, marketing skills in mobile marketing can distin-  
guish themselves as this skill is now recognized and will provide com-  
petitive advantages for their career and for their employers. They are in  
high demand in the meeting and event industry. Employers will seek  
those individuals who have the appropriate skills to conduct new types  
of marketing and public relations involving new media, particularly  
mobile apps.

# Guest-Generated Content  
“Consumer generated content is rapidly gaining traction as part of  
the purchase decision making process.”  
—Peter O’Connor, Institute de Management,  
Hotele International, Essec Business School, France \(2008\)  
“Once upon a time there were two countries, at war with each other.  
In order to make peace after many years of conflict, they decided to  
build a bridge across the ocean. But because they never learned each  
other’s language properly, they could never agree on the details, so the  
two halves of the bridge they started to build never met. To this day  
the bridge extends far into the ocean from both sides, and simply ends  
half way, miles in the wrong direction from the meeting point. And  
the two countries are still at war.”

■ Moderate guest-generated content for your meeting and event  
to ensure appropriate comments are included

■ Measure and evaluate guest-related content for evaluative pur-  
poses  
INTRODUCTION  
Each day tens of millions of guest-generated comments are added to  
the World Wide Web. These comments may be seen through consumer  
media such as online newspapers, blogs, social media, and other elec-  
tronic channels. When Sir Tim Berners-Lee helped weave the world-  
wide web, he submitted guest-generated comment when he wrote “This  
is for everyone” \(Berners-Lee, 1999\).  
Through the development of the World Wide Web, both oppor-  
tunities and challenges have risen regarding developing and man-  
aging guest-generated content. For the purposes of this chapter,  
the terms guest-generated and user-generated content will be used  
interchangeably.  
Guest-generated content is a critical tool for meeting and event pro-  
fessionals in that it promotes engagement in the content of the meeting  
or event as well as widens and deepens the relationship between the  
guest and the host organization.  
Historically, once the flood gates of the World Wide Web were  
first opened in the early 1990s, the concept of guest-generated content  
merely naturally and exponentially evolved without a specific strategy  
for cultivation, conversion, and evaluation of the engagement of the  
individuals submitting their comments and opinions.Guest-Generated Content ² 263  
According to the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the Tower  
of Babel represented a single language that united humanity following  
the great flood. In the twenty-first century we now have a similar flood  
of information and must develop a language to enable our meeting and  
event guests to effectively engage with one another as well as the con-  
tent of our programs.  
ORIGINS, MOTIVATIONS AND INCENTIVES  
OF USER-GENERATED CONTENT  
According to Levine and Prietula \(2013\), user-generated content is  
often produced through open collaboration. The term first emerged in  
2005 through web publishing and new media content. Websites such as  
Amazon.com and TripAdvisor.com rely on user-generated content to  
provide reviews and promote sales. The concept of user-generated con-  
tent grew so quickly that in 2006 the U.S. publication TIME Magazine  
selected as their person of the year “You” to signify the rise in impor-  
tance of the consumer voice online.  
The incentives of user-generated content are both implicit and  
explicit. Implicit motivations are generally concerned with social rela-  
tionships, and one example of this is Facebook friends. Another exam-  
ple of where a user implicitly seeks content is Yahoo Answers. The  
explicit motivations relate to tangible rewards that are usually financial  
in nature. This may include searching for new jobs or entrepreneurial  
advice.  
The Organization of Economic and Cooperative Development  
\(OECD\) \(2007\) has identified three primary schools of user-generated  
content\:  
First, there is a publication requirement, and this may exclude  
e-mail and instant messaging.  
Secondly, there is the creative effort put into the online publica-  
tion. However, according to the OECD, this may be difficult to define.264 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Thirdly and finally, the work is created outside of professional rou-  
tines and practices. This may relate to work being produced outside the  
normal time bands of work and professional duty.  
Whilst these are general considerations, they may provide guidance  
for meeting and event planners when attempting to define for their  
guests the purposes and potentials of their generated comment.  
During the past ten years there have been significant issues related  
to copyright and trademark infringement and bullying associated with  
user-generated content. Generally, in the U.S., copyright infringement  
is exempt with regard to user-generated content; however, in Europe  
the regulations are more complex. The issue of bullying, especially  
among adolescents, has grown in recent years with, sadly, even suicides  
being reported as a result of individuals receiving critical and negative  
comments online.  
Therefore, while vox populi \(the public voice\) is critically important  
in terms of promoting a democratic state, it must be carefully culti-  
vated, developed, managed, and evaluated to ensure that it promotes  
positive engagement among meeting and event guests in a sustainable  
manner.  
Encourage and drive guest-generated content to your  
meeting and event website and through social media  
Since the development of user-generated content in 2005 the invitation  
to “follow”, “like”, add a hashtag “ become a friend”, “post” has become  
commonplace at meetings and events. Literally millions of meeting and  
event guests have become further engaged in the content of their spon-  
soring organizations by connecting online.  
One of the key issues regarding this engagement is the question of  
conversion. How does the meeting and event planner convert the guest-  
user content provider into an active attendee, volunteer, or leader? This  
evidence has not appeared to date; however, there does appear to beGuest-Generated Content ² 265  
anecdotal evidence that the more engaged an association member is  
with their organization, the more likely they are to renew their mem-  
bership. Therefore, the opportunity to encourage and drive guest-gen-  
erated content to various social media platforms may ultimately lead to  
more committed members and participants.  
According to Computer Hope \(2014\), when redirecting guests to  
your website, make certain you include a slash at the end of your URL,  
such as http\://www.computerhope.com/. This will avoid re-directs to  
other sites and will send the guest directly to your website. Computer  
Hope further recommends personalizing your relationship with users  
by collecting birthdays and automatically sending them a Happy Birth-  
day notice. Finally, Computer Hope recommends that you carefully  
consider the bandwidth, user, and the hardware they will use to view  
your content before you design your web pages or develop your con-  
tent. Hardware and software may vary widely as will bandwidth, and  
therefore it is important that you customize your content to reach as  
many users as possible.  
Bob Vaez, chief executive of Eventmobi.com, sees collaborative  
technologies as a major trend in the development of meeting and event  
technologies. Bob states that “We’re already starting to see the person-  
alized event experience take shape through event apps. One example  
is providing attendees with the ability to create a personal schedule  
via mobile app rather than circling sessions in a show guide. Another  
would be the ability to manage an event app personal profile which is  
essentially allowing attendees to manage their online presence at the  
event. The personalized experience will continue to improve as tech-  
nology more deeply integrates with personal technology like smart-  
phones and tablets” \(2014\).  
He further argues that the growth in mobile technology has rapidly  
accelerated user-generated content. According to Vaez, “We’re already  
seeing the impact mobile has on meeting planning with the ability to  
connect anytime, anywhere. This also allows planners to stay connected  
to their events and their attendees at all times, ensuring that everything266 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
is proceeding as planned. A quick text message from the other side of  
the conference hall or a tweet from disgruntled attendees allows plan-  
ners and their teams to provide instant customer service. It’s important  
to remember that positive experiences go a long way too; happy attend-  
ees will tweet their experience and share it with friends and colleagues.”  
Click Z \(2014\) has identified five effective methods for repurposing  
user-generated content\:  
1\. Interviews. Raising questions is one of the most basic ways  
to crowdsource content. The method to employ depends on  
the desired outcome. Asking the community for suggestions  
of whom to interview and what questions to ask is a great way  
to get people involved. Interviewing industry thought leaders  
provides the brand’s audience with unique content and cre-  
ates a positive association between the “brandividual” and the  
company.  
2\. Social Q&A. Yahoo Answers, LinkedIn, and sites like Quora  
can provide very useful platforms to present questions and  
attract answers from a variety of people. Of course, your intent  
needs to be clear, and permission for reuse should be obtained  
before republishing. Those familiar with the Q&A communities  
can word questions to attract replies from specific individuals  
who might not otherwise respond to a content participation  
pitch via e-mail.  
3\. Contests resulting in content. Examples of contests in which  
consumers produce their own videos and share images abound  
on the social web. Search engines love any kind of content,  
especially text.  
Andy Beal runs a great contest for a search marketing schol-  
arship on his Marketing Pilgrim blog \(www.marketingpilgrim.  
com\). The articles written by contestants drive traffic to Andy’s  
website and also become content on it. To top it off, the articles  
are compiled into an e-book.Guest-Generated Content ² 267  
4\. Comment feedback loop. One of the most meaningful ways  
for a community to engage with a brand is through comments  
on a company blog. Asking readers to participate in a dialogue  
by commenting can result in content that is better than the  
original blog post.  
Brands can then recognize blog commenters by drawing atten-  
tion to the “best of ” comments through a separate blog post or  
in a newsletter \(at our agency, we do it in the TopRank Market-  
ing Newsletter\).  
5\. Book authoring by community. Reaching out to industry  
experts to share their insights as part of a larger project can  
be very effective. Author Michael Miller \(2008\) did this with  
Online Marketing Heroes, of which I was a part. He interviewed  
25 successful marketers; the results of those interviews became  
the book.  
Another example involves soliciting subject matter experts to  
write articles of 1,000 words or so on predetermined topics. The  
brand serves as editor to compile the articles into an e-book,  
which can be used as fulfillment in a lead generation campaign.  
Meeting and event planners may use each of these five methods  
to engage and drive guests to their website and social media.  
You should fully exploit the democratization of the Internet  
by inviting your members or attendees to nominate individ-  
uals they would like to be interviewed or to vote for the top  
members in your organization. This provides an opportunity  
for your members and participants to organically develop your  
organization’s brand identity.  
In Great Britain, there is a tradition of appointing a journalist  
to serve as an “Agony Aunt” and answer personal questions in  
the national newspapers. You may adapt this idea within your  
organization by inviting content experts and others to provide  
online advice for users.268 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
You may further the brand identity of your organization by  
inviting users to create videos describing what they have  
learned at your conference or how they have benefitted from  
your exhibition.  
Finally, you may collate all of the comments from your users  
and include them in an online book or article to provide a  
permanent record with potential analysis of their findings.  
Through each of these activities you are increasing the value  
of your organization or meeting and event for your partic-  
ipants. You are providing added value with minimal cost.  
Perhaps most importantly, you are leveraging the value of  
your existing content by introducing your conference, meet-  
ings, exhibition, and organization to many more potential  
stakeholders.  
Moderate guest-generated content for your meeting  
and event to ensure appropriate comments are  
included  
According to Cognizant \(Khadilkar, 2015\), 4.1 million minutes of video  
are uploaded to YouTube every day, and six billion images per month  
are uploaded to Facebook. However, 40% of images, and 80% of videos  
\[created\] are inappropriate for business. How do you carefully reduce  
the risk and moderate your user-generated content?  
The three main methods for moderating your content include\:  
1\. Automated moderation, using computer applications and  
algorithms.  
2\. Community moderation, leveraging the online commu-  
nity to self-moderate content \(such as flagging or volunteer  
administration\).  
3\. Human moderation, whether by a dedicated staff person or  
crowdsourced.Guest-Generated Content ² 269  
Automated moderation is very effective by identifying keywords  
and phrases that should not be allows to be included. However, as with  
any automated system, it must also be audited frequently to ensure that  
it is not ruling out the good with the bad content.  
Community moderation is best exemplified by sites such as Wiki-  
pedia where users moderate the content to ensure that it is accurate and  
current.  
Finally, human moderation, while the most time consuming and  
expensive, requires trained staff to view all posts and then approve  
them before they are allowed to be seen by others. This is most effec-  
tive with a smaller online community.  
According to Cognizant research \(Khadilkar, Pai, and Ghadiali,  
2014\), human moderation can be extremely expensive. Figure 12.1  
depicts the potential costs you may incur.  
Many organizations have begun to outsource their content moder-  
ation tasks to reduce costs. Current research provides some evidence

Figure 12.1. Adapted by Goldblatt from Cognizant Research 2014. 270 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
that the earlier content is moderated \(for example, using automated  
filters\), the less likely there is to be a significant negative impact to the  
organization brand at a later date. Therefore, upstream monitoring of  
content results in less downstream problems later.  
One of the best examples of the importance of content moderation  
is the website TripAdvisor.com. TripAdvisor.com was founded in 2000.  
It claims it is the world’s largest travel site, with over 100 million users.  
TripAdvisor has experienced many controversies in less than fif-  
teen years. For example, 30 hotels have been blacklisted by the site for  
posting suspicious reviews, and one hotel in Cornwall, England, was  
accused of bribing guests to post positive reviews.  
As recent as 2011, *The Guardian* newspaper \(Sweney, 2011\)  
reported that the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority  
stated that TripAdvisor must not claim that all of its reviews were from  
real travelers, are honest, and may therefore be trusted. The TripAdvi-  
sor example should serve as a loud and clear warning to organizations  
that promote user-generated content that strong disclaimers are needed  
to alert the readers that the opinions being offered do not necessarily  
reflect those of the host organization and that they may or may not be  
accurate and trustworthy.  
In the U.S. hospitality industry there have been isolated examples of  
businesses being negatively impacted by harsh reviews on TripAdvisor  
and other sites. As a result, these same hospitality organizations often  
monitor these sites carefully and offer rebuttals as needed to provide read-  
ers with additional information to help protect their brand and reputation.  
Meeting and event organizations should similarly monitor wherever  
possible those sites that that post reviews or other opinions regarding their  
programs and be prepared to counter these comments with a rational and  
objective description of the actual service that was provided. Further, it  
is helpful to have a meeting and event blogging team standing by to dis-  
seminate positive views to counter the negative ones whenever possible. Guest-Generated Content ² 271  
Promote democracy and transparency in terms of  
guest-related content  
Although moderation is an essential part of the overall guest-gener-  
ated content process, it is equally important to practice democracy and  
transparency. If you do not allow all sides of the argument, all views of  
the situation, and all feelings to be expressed, your readers may be sus-  
picious that you are biased in your approach to their content.  
Therefore, it is valuable to appoint a guest-generated content  
ombudsman who will represent the readers and investigate where nec-  
essary to ensure that all points of view are being allowed to be pre-  
sented. Guests should be directed on your website to an e-mail address  
for the ombudsman, such as ombudsman@ABCassociation.org, to  
address their queries, complaints and suggestions. The ombudsman  
then should respond in a prompt manner following their investigation  
and provide constructive recommendations on how to remedy the issue  
to promote greater democratization and transparency in the future.  
Avoid bullying and harmful comments through  
guest-related content  
One of the major challenges of the twenty-first century Internet is the  
prevalence of online bullying, especially amongst adolescents. Accord-  
ing to Bullying Statistics \(2014\), cyber bullying may include any of the  
following seven activities\:  
1\. Sending mean messages or threats to a person’s e-mail account  
or cell phone.  
2\. Spreading rumors online or through texts.  
3\. Posting hurtful or threatening messages on social networking  
sites or web pages.  
4\. Stealing a person’s account information to break into their  
account and send damaging messages.  
5\. Pretending to be someone else online to hurt another person.272 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
6\. Taking unflattering pictures of a person and spreading them  
through cell phones or the Internet.  
7\. Sexting, or circulating sexually suggestive pictures or messages  
about a person.  
This is a growing problem among young people as evidenced by the  
following statistics\:  
■ Over half of adolescents and teens have been bullied online,  
and about the same number have engaged in cyber bullying.  
■ More than 1 in 3 young people have experienced cyber threats  
online.  
■ Over 25 percent of adolescents and teens have been bullied  
repeatedly through their cell phones or the Internet.  
■ Well over half of young people do not tell their parents when  
cyber bullying occurs.  
According to the Cyber Bully Research Center, this problem has  
become more severe.  
■ Over 80 percent of teens use a cell phone regularly, making it  
the most popular form of technology and a common medium  
for cyber bullying.  
■ About half of young people have experienced some form of  
cyber bullying, and 10 to 20 percent experience it regularly.  
■ Mean, hurtful comments and spreading rumors are the most  
common type of cyber bullying.  
■ Girls are at least as likely as boys to be cyber bullies or their  
victims.  
■ Boys are more likely to be threatened by cyber bullies than girls.  
■ Cyber bullying affects all races.  
■ Cyber bullying victims are more likely to have low self-esteem  
and to consider suicide.Guest-Generated Content ² 273  
Therefore, meeting and event planners may be liable for the actions  
of others through the abuse of user-generated content to bully, blacklist,  
or damage the reputation of others. Organizations that offer user-gener-  
ated content opportunities should encourage their users to immediately  
report any evidence of bullying to their ombudsman or web editor. The  
individuals who are being bullied should be told to save the negative  
messages they are receiving and then forward them to the person you  
have appointed to investigate within your organization.  
Measure and evaluate guest-related content for  
evaluative purposes  
Measurement is a continuous process through the meeting and event  
user-generated content journey. EventMobi’s Bob Vaez states that  
“With the ability to track one’s behavior and progress through a set of  
challenges or educational tracks, technology can help in the continuing  
learning experience after the event. Following up on the event expe-  
rience has always been a challenge but with technology, it’s possible  
to extend the experience with new, open channels of communication,  
constant updates of event material, and strategic promotions to tie  
events together year-after-year” \(Vaez, 2014\).  
There are numerous ways to measure and evaluate guest-related  
content within your organization. However, most corporations and  
associations find it very difficult to measure. Figure 12.2 depicts where  
they focus their evaluative efforts in order to obtain a return on objec-  
tive, according to a recent study of corporations that evaluate their  
social media presence.  
The use of Facebook likes and clickthroughs and retweets domi-  
nates all other metrics. This organization estimates that the cost of the  
transaction for social media is equivalent to five percent per sale.  
Therefore, while the scientific methodology for measuring the  
value of guest-generated comment through social media is continually  
developing in the twenty-first century, it is important for your orga-274 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

For example, you may seek to attract more nonmembers to your  
social media and guests user content sites. Further, you may wish to  
convert a greater percentage of casual visitors to become members or  
attendees at your conference. Therefore, it is important that you identify  
specific objectives for each task and then measure your performance in  
a real time manner.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
In less than ten years, the growth of guest-generated content has  
become one of the most important trends in the twenty-first century  
meetings and events industry. Through the widespread availability of  
mobile phones and Wi-Fi, the average meeting and event attendee is  
able to multitask anywhere and everywhere. Part of this multitasking  
relationship should include a continuous conversation with your orga-  
nization to deepen their relationship with your content. By providing  
them with the invitation, accessibility, tools, safety protocols, and mod-  
eration, you may not only rapidly engage and convert more partici-  
pants but also greatly improve your overall brand identity.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. How will you use a content expert to answer questions about  
your meeting and event content in a real-time manner during  
your program?  
2\. How will you moderate comments to promote democracy but  
protect and preserve your meeting and event brand image?  
TASK  
Create a guest-user quiz about your meeting and event content to  
engage your participants before, during, and after the meeting. Using  
Figure 12.3 as a guide, create an evaluation metric to increase the num-  
ber of likes, clickthroughs, and retweets from your meeting and event.276 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

INTRODUCTION  
How technologies change meeting/event registration  
The history of meeting and event management registration systems  
is one that spans barely fifteen years and yet is fraught with explosive  
277 278 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
growth. According to Rick Borry \(2014\), one of the first online meet-  
ing and event registration systems was titled Enteronline.com and first  
appeared in 1997. This system was used to register runners for sports  
events. Borry then launched Register123.com in 1998 to create an  
online registration platform for business events.  
By the end of 1998 Regweb had a working registration system  
and was soon followed by B-There.com. These platforms were rap-  
idly followed by Starcite, Plansoft, SeeUThere, Evite, Acteva, Regon-  
line, and ultimately Cvent.com. According to Borry, although the  
rapid development of new products created a cluttered marketplace,  
few organizations really understood the potential for the online reg-  
istration system. However, in the latter part of the twentieth cen-  
tury George Little Management, one of the largest producers of trade  
shows in the United States, adopted Register123 as their online reg-  
istration system, and they continue to use online registration fifteen  
years later.  
Borry states that one of the most important considerations in the  
development of online registration systems was trust. The major issue  
was the replacement of trust in a physical site to one that is virtual.  
However, following the economic decline in the meetings and events  
industry of 2001, there was a need to automate registration procedures  
due to large numbers of reduction in staff in the meetings and events  
industry. As a result of this need and the growth of online transactions,  
trust naturally developed among meeting and event registrants who  
sought faster, easier, and more efficient ways to register and complete  
their transactions.  
GROWTH OF ONLINE MEETING AND EVENT  
REGISTRATION  
In 2000, Professor Joe Goldblatt predicted at the “Beyond 2000” con-  
ference for event educators in Sydney, Australia, that the majority of  
registrations would shift to online within the first decade of the twen-  
ty-first century. Due to the various registration products identified byRegistration and Transaction Systems ² 279  
Borry, the need by meeting and event organizations to reduce costs and  
the desire by meeting and event attendees to save time and increase  
efficiency, this prediction has come true.  
There are still challenges with online registration systems, includ-  
ing security, encryption, and ease of download due to limited broad-  
band capacity of users. However, it is predicted by many meeting and  
event planners that online meeting and event registration will continue  
to grow rapidly throughout the twenty-first century. One of the major  
proponents of this growth has been the explosion of mobile technol-  
ogies throughout the world. The opportunity to register for a meet-  
ing or event using 3 or 4 G any time and anywhere is very attractive  
to busy millennials who often combine work and leisure experiences.  
Therefore, it is essential that meeting and event planners understand  
and master the potential usages of online registration systems to best  
benefit their attendees and their organizations in the near and mid-  
term future.  
ONLINE REGISTRATION SYSTEM  
As Internet use becomes increasingly common, websites have  
become essential attributes for events companies, which resulted in  
an increased use of online registration. Online registration software  
can maximize event administrative staff productivity and increase  
the number of attendees from improved response rates. Handling  
registrations by paper is now rarely done; it can cause inaccuracy  
of data; confusion of details; the need to manually edit registration  
information, cancel a registration and issue a refund; and inefficiency  
in processing and confirming that many event organizers had to suf-  
fer. Fortunately, online payment along with online registration have  
developed quickly and easily. Today’s events are promoted via online-  
based and branded event websites, and attendees register an event via  
linked online registration pages. To establish a secure and easy-to-  
use online registration system, there are necessary components of an  
online registration system.280 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
COMPONENTS OF ONLINE REGISTRATION SYSTEM  
Online registration system  
There are two ways to create an online registration system. One is to  
develop your own registration system. This is ideal for a case of an  
ongoing \(reoccurring\) large annual event/meeting. This is particu-  
larly beneficial as it is easier to develop a tailored registration page per  
needs. While there is an initial development cost of an organization’s  
own online registration system, it will meet the break-even point even-  
tually, and after that there will be virtually no additional cost for the  
system \(except some maintenance or ongoing upgrade, if necessary\).  
The other option is to subscribe to an online registration service operated  
by third-party suppliers. Third-party online registration systems \(further  
discussed later in this chapter\) charge fees per number of registrants.  
Therefore, a meeting/event organization that hosts an annual or recur-  
ring event with a large number of attendees will end up paying a large  
amount of online registration service fees year after year. This option is,  
however, ideal for a small organization that doesn’t have many resources  
\(e.g. IT professionals and infrastructure\) and which hosts occasional and  
nonrecurring events and meetings. As the cost of online registration ser-  
vice will be by the number of registrants, and security and technical sup-  
port is all included in the charge, this may be the most economical and  
secure online registration solution for these organizations.  
While not every event needs a custom design, it is a great way to set reg-  
istration pages and event pages apart from others and to create a seam-  
less experience from the organization’s website to the event. Details of  
third-party online registration service providers will be discussed in  
later in this chapter.  
Printing name badges and labels  
Once registration is closed and the necessary information has been col-  
lected from attendees, the next step is to create custom name badges and  
mailing labels. This step is now integrated with online registration systemRegistration and Transaction Systems ² 281  
so name badges and mailing labels can be quickly and easily extracted  
from the attendees’ data to create name badges for attendees.  
Security protocol  
The importance of securing attendees’ information has never been more  
important than now. We hear news constantly of customers’ confiden-  
tial information \(including financial information\) being breached by  
hackers. This results in millions of dollars lost to the company and loss  
of credibility from their customers. The same level of attention to data  
security should be paid to the event registration system. Advancements  
in online payment processing are more secure than ever and provide  
peace of mind to both attendees and event organizers. The Payment  
Card Industry \(PCI\) \(an information security standard for organiza-  
tions that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes\)  
regulates online payment security and procedure in various transac-  
tions. PCI Compliance Level 1 is one of the highest level of security,  
and it is suggested by many online registration system.  
Additional functions  
Today’s meeting and events offer various activities outside of formal pro-  
grams. They include special event tickets, day trips, and pre- and post-  
tours. It is important that an online registration system provides easy  
navigation through all of the event’s offerings. The online registration  
should be designed to accurately track and confirm an individual event as  
an attendee sign up for different sessions or break-outs. In addition, online  
registration can lead to access housing sites and travel \(airline, rental car,  
train, etc.\) solutions for easy management of event travel planning.  
ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE REGISTRATION SYSTEM  
Save time and accuracy of registration data  
Instead of collecting information from attendees and keying that data  
into another program, online registration system lets attendees enter282 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
their own information. This helps to avoid mistakes by having attend-  
ees enter their own information directly into the system so that infor-  
mation is not misinterpreted or misplaced by event organizers on the  
other end.  
Imagine that for today’s global events and meeting, attendees’  
address formats, names, and job titles may be all different by the ori-  
gin of attendees. For example, one of the author’s friends, who is from  
Thailand, has this last name\:  
NI-RAT-PAT-TA-NA-SAI  
It is almost impossible to enter this last name without a typological  
error by a registration staff in U.S. Similar stories apply to addresses.  
Another example\: the address of South Korea is something like this\:  
456-3 Kaeyang-dong, Pupyong-ku, Inchon metropolitan city,  
South Korea 403-113  
An online registration form can allow attendees from around the  
world to enter their accurate information by setting up structures for  
entering information field specific to an attendee’s country of origin.  
Easy change/cancellation of registration  
Online registration systems offer services not only to register but also  
to modify, cancel, and refund attendees. Changes are easily made and  
communicated to attendees. Some systems even allow registrants to  
do these operations themselves. This can save a tremendous amount  
of time and labor by the use of a confirmation number or e-mail  
address.  
Multi-track registration  
Online registration systems can build a dynamic, multi-track,  
multi-session event registration process. They can provide options  
to let attendees sign up for different “tracks” or themed sessions, orRegistration and Transaction Systems ² 283  
even choose from different sessions to make their own dynamic track  
throughout the course of the overall event.  
Easy duplication of a past event registration page  
Many events are reoccurring ones. An online registration system allows  
cloning previously created events easily. Past event registration pages  
can easily be duplicated and updated for a new event. The ability to  
copy event links from one event to the next can save a significant  
amount of time and minimizes redundancies across similar events.  
Easy filtering of registration  
Online registration systems can be used to restrict registration by filter-  
ing the number of registrants, e-mail addresses, registration codes, or  
unique IDs assigned to each invitee. There are meetings and events that  
offer some information or particular sessions to only assigned group  
of invitees or to only a limited number. An automated wait list can be  
created to limit capacity to the event or to particular sessions. With the  
options made available by an online registration system, setting these  
restrictions and permissions can be easy.  
Instant confirmation  
Online registration can provide an instant confirmation of registration  
to attendees via e-mail and a registration page along with a registration  
receipt \(if applicable\). Processing payments is simple, and all data is  
easily accessible. This prompt process can give attendees an assurance  
of their successful registration and the processing of their payment.  
Attendee tracking and customized report  
With an online registration process, customized reports can be  
pulled in an instant. Event and meeting planners can easily access  
detailed reports leading up to events to better understand attendee  
segments. This can help event/meeting planners customize events  
for their audience.284 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Survey  
The survey tool can be integrated within an online registration system  
to track attendee satisfaction and allow attendee suggestions in order to  
improve programs year after year.  
ONLINE TRANSACTION/PAYMENT SYSTEM  
Among many event operation tasks, handling processing payments and  
refunds manually can be one of the most challenging tasks. An online  
transaction/payment system provides collecting payments quickly and  
transmitting them securely into an event organizer’s bank account. It  
should allow registrants to choose alternate payment options, such as  
payment by check, purchase order, or wire transfer. The online trans-  
action/payment system also needs to allow purchases of other prod-  
ucts and services for its attendees. Today’s events usually offer various  
extra fee activities and merchandise \(e.g. event T-shirts, books\).There-  
fore an online transaction system should be able to integrate with an  
existing merchant account and virtually any e-commerce gateway. It  
is important to confirm that an online registration company doesn’t  
charge a transaction fee as a middle man and that event registration  
payments and other transactions are directed into an event organizer’s  
financial account.  
Security protocol  
The most widely adopted payment policy is the Payment Card Indus-  
try Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\), a set of requirements designed  
to ensure that companies that process, store, or transmit credit card  
information maintain a secure environment. Essentially any merchant  
who is certified as PCI Level 1 compliant, the highest security rating  
issued by the PCI, can provide assurance of security to users of online  
transaction systems, and event organizers can have confidence in data  
security.Registration and Transaction Systems ² 285  
SCREEN SHOT  
The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council \(PCI SSC\)  
denotes the debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and POS cards and  
associated businesses. It is is an open global forum for the ongoing  
development, enhancement, storage, dissemination, and implemen-  
tation of security standards for account data protection. The council  
was originally formed by American Express, Discover Financial Ser-  
vices, JCB, MasterCard and VISA on Sept. 7, 2006, with the goal of  
managing the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry Data  
Security Standard.  
The PCI Data Security Standard is comprised of 12 general require-  
ments designed to build and maintain a secure network; protect card-  
holder data; ensure the maintenance of vulnerability management  
programs; implement strong access control measures; regularly mon-  
itor and test networks; and ensure the maintenance of information  
security policies.  
A Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI-DSS\) Level 1  
is the highest possible security level in accordance with the PCI-DSS.

ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE TRANSACTION/PAYMENT  
SYSTEM  
■ Logistical headaches often stem from manual payment transac-  
tions. Instead, collecting online payments can provide follow-  
ing advantages\:286 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Easy setup of various registration fees  
Events and meetings use variable pricing \(e.g. early registration dis-  
counts, group registration discounts, member vs. non-member fees\),  
and this can be a challenging task when using a manual transac-  
tion system. However, variable pricing can be easily set up using an  
online transaction/payment system by using dynamic pricing based  
on registrant type and key due dates.  
Faster receivables  
Online transaction/payment processing makes collecting event fees  
convenient for registrants and planners alike. Online transaction/pay-  
ment systems allow faster deposit of registration fees and other dues  
by attendees for meeting/event organizers, with real-time tracking and  
automated refunds. It is very critical as many payables of event/meet-  
ing planning are due before the actual event, so cash flow is incredibly  
important to operating event expenses. In addition, deposited funds  
can generate interest, which can be an extra revenue item. For exam-  
ple, 1,000 attendees paid early-bird registration fees at US \$1,000 each,  
which is total of \$1,000,000 in a savings account. If the savings account  
has a 1.9% interest rate, an event organizer can earn \$156 in interest  
earnings each month. Once an attendee clicks the “confirm payment”  
button from the registration page, the fees will be immediately depos-  
ited into the event organizer’s account.  
Processing various forms of payment  
As meetings and events are a global business, there are many attend-  
ees and suppliers from around world. That means that international  
currencies will be used, and an event organizer should be prepared to  
handle those. In addition there will be various formats of payment such  
as major credit cards as well as payment by check, cashier’s check, pur-  
chase order, or wire transfer.  
Many of the aforementioned forms of payment must be deposited to  
the physical bank by delivering them physically, and it takes more timeRegistration and Transaction Systems ² 287  
Figure 13.1. Online Transaction E-commerce Gateways  
for those funds to become available \(some may take weeks to be cleared  
if the payment is issued by an international financial institution\).  
Integrating with e-commerce gateways  
Online transaction/payment system providers can connect an event orga-  
nization’s existing merchant account or acquire a new merchant account  
for seamless payment processing. They provide a quick payments pro-  
cess via e-commerce. The most utilized online payment service providers  
include Verisign, Cybersource, Touchnet, or PayPal Express.  
Quick and automated refunds  
Attendees are impatient especially when it is about refunds. Refunding  
money quickly and accurately can be done effortlessly by an automated  
refund procedure in the transaction/payment system. It can help to  
minimize the workload by establishing an automated refund structure  
that is contingent upon the date someone cancels a registration.

SECURITY OF ONLINE PAYMENT AND ATTENDEE  
INFORMATION  
As the majority of meeting/event registrations have moved to online, col-  
lection of secure online payments has become very critical in meeting  
management.  
Secure Online Payments  
Setting up secure, automated payments and refunds is very critical  
in online registration management. This requires secure processing  
of fees via Payment Card Industry \(PCI\) compliant tools. As mobile-  
based payment is growing, it is of increasing importance to provide  
secure collection of registration payments and other important trans-  
actions via secure mobile.  
Security of Attendee Information  
A security policy for handling attendee information must be in place  
to prevent any improper access or damage of attendee information.  
Proper handling is sometimes mandated by law. Legal and professional  
requirements apply to sensitive personal information \(e.g. medical  
information, financial information\) about attendees.  
The good news for event/meeting organizations is that most online  
registration systems are now run by third-party online registration  
providers using a cloud computing system, which provides better man-  
agement of data security and loss prevention. It is critical to maintain  
a high level of secrecy as it is concerned with improper disclosure of  
information.  
NEW TREND\: MOBILE REGISTRATION SYSTEM/APPS  
Smart mobile devices \(e.g. iPhones, iPads, Android-based smarthones,  
Google phones, etc.\) are being used in many meeting/event manage-  
ment functions. Therefore, many online registration service providers292 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
offer mobile-based registration and attendee management services. They  
include\:  
■ Mobile event apps\: A branded mobile event app enhances  
attendees’ registration experience. The attendees can manage  
their event registration, access up-to-date event information,  
and improve networking opportunities via a mobile connec-  
tion.  
■ Mobile attendee management\: An event/meeting planner can  
access all attendee and event information from his/her mobile  
device and make quick updates wherever and whenever. It can  
be utilized for on-site registration and session check-ins.  
CONCLUSION  
The rapid growth of online registration systems for meetings and events  
is well documented. What is not so well understood is how these sys-  
tems will be protected and regulated by governments as the issue of  
individual privacy becomes of greater and greater concern to politi-  
cians, bureaucrats, and users of these systems.  
In this chapter you have explored the brief but explosive history of  
online meeting and event registration systems. You have also learned  
the purpose of these systems and their potential for increasing bot-  
tom-line revenue for your meeting and event organization. Finally, you  
have learned why security and privacy are increasingly important and  
how you may adopt and develop procedures to help reduce your risk  
through information gathering.  
DISCUSSION  
Discuss with others how you would consult with your potential meet-  
ing and event participants to identify their needs, wants, and desires  
before developing an online registration system. What types of ques-  
tions will you ask them? Then determine, based upon their responses,Registration and Transaction Systems ² 293  
whether you will use an existing online registration system or if you  
will create your own customized system for your meetings and events.  
TASK  
1\. Work with a small group and use Cvent.com or Eventbrite.com  
to create a test online registration platform for your event. Once  
you have developed the site, ask the users for their feedback.  
2\. Discuss importance of security \(payment, attendee informa-  
tion\) and role of PCI.

# Crowdsourcing for Events  
“There are reasons to believe that the current manifestations  
of crowdsourcing are just a prelude to a far more pervasive  
transformation. Actually, there are about 200 million reasons to  
believe it. That’s the rough number of kids around the world that  
currently have Internet access”.

INTRODUCTION  
The environment in which we live today provokes us not only to be  
part of an audience, but also to step on the stage and participate in  
what’s happing there. New technologies provide opportunities for  
members of the audience to share comments, then express an opin-  
ion, and nowadays, to take an active part in the decision-making  
process. Without any doubt, the Internet gives people around the  
world a medium where they can easily collaborate with one another.  
Witnessing this process, businesses started looking for ways to take  
advantage of this growing power. In other words, many have started  
considering how to use the creative and productive capabilities of  
Internet users to obtain their tangible objectives. In the process of  
working out the best possible way to get hold of the power of users,  
many companies have started asking questions; some have even  
asked for help. It was difficult in the beginning, as companies had  
to admit that someone outside their company could come up with  
a solution, a proposition, or an idea that turned out to be better  
than the ones suggested by their own staff. However, following the  
steps of other successful businesses, companies have realized that  
the change is ongoing and is here to stay. All this resulted in their  
establishing close relationships with audiences, facilitating the par-  
ticipation of consumers in the making process. The latter model  
was used by private companies, NGOs, governments, and different  
organizations.  
The contributing editor of Wired Magazine, Jeff Howe, along  
with Mark Robinson coined the term “crowdsourcing” in June 2006.  
In an article published in Wired, Howe asks the following ques-  
tion\: Remember outsourcing? Sending jobs to India and China in  
2003? The new pool of cheap labor is now everyday people using  
their spare time to create content, solve problems, even do corpo-  
rate R&D. That phenomenon is called crowdsourcing. According to  
Howe, “Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a com-  
pany or institution taking a function once performed by employeesCrowdsourcing for Events ² 297  
and outsourcing it to an undefined \(and generally large\) network  
of people in the form of an open call… The critical prerequisite is  
the use of the open call format and the large network of potential  
laborers” \(Howe, 2006\).  
Crowdsourcing would not be so popular and easy to use without  
the Internet. In fact, it is the Internet that allows us to communicate  
fast and cheaply with a large network of people. According to Daren  
C. Brab­ ham, “Crowdsourcing is not merely a web 2.0 buzzword, but  
instead a strategic model to attract an interested, motivated crowd  
of individuals capable of providing solutions superior in quality and  
quantity to those that even traditional forms of business can” \(Bra-  
bham, 2008\).  
It is important to point out that the process is sponsored by an orga-  
nization, and that the working process of the crowd is directed by this  
organization. Crowdsourcing can be defined as a creative top-down  
managed process. In addition to this, in most cases the organization  
makes a considerable profit from the work of the crowd and, conse-  
quently, offers different rewards, even individual prizes, to its most effi-  
cient and conscientious workers.  
Due to the fact that crowdsourcing is at the top of some business  
agendas, many specialists study the phenomenon to find out which fac-  
tors motivate people to be part of that new crowd. If we look at the top  
ten reasons and try to incorporate them into the event industry, we  
will find different ways to use crowdsourcing in events as well as what  
precisely motivates the crowd to participate \(Table 14.1\).  
Depending on the purpose of crowdsourcing, in general, we can  
define four different types.  
Type 1\: Crowd Creation. We ask individuals in the crowd to  
create a video, translate from one language to another, solve chal-  
lenging scientific problems, etc. Crowdsourcing can be effective not  
only for sourcing new writing, photography, music and film, ideas298 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies

Sharing with others Sharing knowledge and expertise with

Having fun Having fun  
for products, speakers and places for events, but also for solving  
real-world scientific problems. For example, one of the problems  
for which crowdsourcing can find a solution to is the need for fresh  
ideas. As specialization in any field is a must nowadays, sometimes  
a lack of experience is the key ingredient for new ideas. Take, for  
instance, the success of the song “Happy” by Pharrell Williams and  
the video release by the name of “Pharrell Williams – Happy – We  
Are from \[name of the city\]”. As of May 2014, more than 1,950  
videos have been created. Inspired by this global phenomenon, a  
French couple launched a website wearehappyfrom.com to show-  
case the remakes. That’s what the crowd can create for your event.  
Of course, you have to hit upon an inspiring idea that will motivate  
the crowd.  
Type 2\: Crowd Voting. In that way we can leverage the communi-  
ty’s judgment to organize, filter, and stack-rank content. Crowd vot-  
ing is the most popular form of crowdsourcing, which generates theCrowdsourcing for Events ² 299  
highest levels of participation. We can apply the 1\:10\:89 rule, which  
states that out of 100 people\:  
■ 1% will create something valuable  
■ 10% will vote and rate submissions  
■ 89% will consume creation.  
For 10% who vote and rate content, “the act of consumption was  
itself an act of creation.” Think about the countless opportunities to  
engage potential guests in voting activity in the early stages of the plan-  
ning process of the event. For example, the crowd could vote on the  
topic of the event, the keynote speaker, the place, the duration, and  
many other different options, including voting for the best picture, best  
cover, and best talk.  
Type 3\: Crowd Wisdom. This refers to harnessing the knowledge of  
a considerable number of people in order to solve problems or predict  
future outcomes or help direct an event strategy. Studies confirm that  
crowds consistently outperform even concentrated groups of highly  
intelligent people. According to Jeff Howe \(2006\), “Given the right set  
of conditions, the crowd will almost always outperform any number of  
employees—a fact that many companies are increasingly attempting to  
exploit.” We will not go into detail in discussing the reasons for this, yet  
it is important to keep in mind that every time you are facing a difficult  
situation, the crowd can offer useful advice and good solutions.  
Type 4\: Crowd Funding. Provided that the traditional corporate  
establishment is not an option for funding, nowadays you can use other  
people’s financial support to execute different ideas. In the event indus-  
try this has been used for a long time, as we can use early-bird offers  
to fund our event in advance. There is a wide range of platforms used  
today that help events to find funding. They will be discussed in greater  
detail later.  
Using the power of the crowd is not an idea we have suddenly come  
across. In fact, we have always asked friends for help. Now, thanks to300 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
networks on the Internet, there are many more real or virtual friends  
and followers whom we can turn to for help.  
Taking advantage of the huge potential and unlimited capabilities  
of the Internet, we can make common cause with people from all over  
the world who can help us develop our projects and vice versa—do  
the same for others. What’s more, now we can benefit from the power  
of the most capable and intelligent people on earth, not only on those  
in the office, as long as we know exactly what we want and how to  
motivate individuals. People, who were once known as being merely  
an audience, behave as participants now. They are ready to share their  
knowledge, time, and efforts if they believe in the benefits.  
What we need to be aware of when we start planning a crowd-  
sourcing strategy is to take into account some basic principles of the  
crowd. First of all, the crowd is everywhere, and while the crowd can  
easily be brought together online, it is very difficult to do the same  
offline. Second, people in the crowd are multitask-oriented, which  
means that we have to suggest such a task that will require less than  
half an hour of their attention. Third, as we count on all people, we can  
find a lot of experts willing to help us. Next, we will not be able to use  
most of the results. Nevertheless, that same crowd is very good at find-  
ing the best solution. What does this mean for event practitioners? At  
first we can receive ideas from all over the world, provided that we ask  
for the right task and offer the right rewards. We have to divide a tough  
task into smaller ones, which people will be able to solve in less than  
30 minutes. Although smart people, professionals with considerable  
expertise, are part of the crowd for a number of different reasons, we  
should not underestimate the level of specialization of such individu-  
als in the crowd. On receiving solutions, we should expect that a lot of  
them will be unusable and valueless, so establishing a mechanism for  
the crowd to evaluate the best ones is of great importance.  
Now, let’s turn to the ways we can use crowdsourcing in the event  
leadership process. According to Dr. Joe Goldblatt, all successful events  
have five critical stages in common to ensure their consistent effectiveness.Crowdsourcing for Events ² 301  
Figure 14.1. Event Leadership Process \(Source\: Goldblatt, 2014\)  
These five phases or steps of successful event leadership are, respectively,  
Research, Design, Planning, Coordination, and Evaluation \(see Figure 14.1\)  
At first glance, we can easily decide that crowdsourcing is not appli-  
cable to all five phases, but after more careful considerations matters  
might look different.  
Phase One\: Research. Generally speaking, we conduct research  
prior to the event because our goal is to produce an event that matches  
best with the planned outcomes of organizers or stakeholders. In the  
course of the planning process, we have to collect different data about  
our potential guests, such as gender, age, and income. We conduct a  
written survey to find out different attitudes and opinions. Moreover,  
we have to examine the culture of the community in order to identify  
comparable characteristics as well as to collect demographic and psy-  
chographic data. Thanks to the Internet we can do that much more  
quickly and at a very reasonable price. Just imagine what a dedicated  
and well-motivated crowd can do for us at that phase. In fact, with the  
help of the crowd, we can collect all the data on condition that we ask302 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
the right person. What’s more, we have to ask for the right task and offer  
the right reward. We can start first by asking participants from the last  
event and expand the database by including people they recommend.  
Thus, with their help we will be able to count on a much greater num-  
ber of participants. Besides, by using various online tools for conduct-  
ing interviews, pools, and conversations, thereby delegating the crowd  
to do the task for us, we are in a position to collect better data than  
ever before. We can even rely on the crowd for the interpretation of  
those results. Let’s take, for example, the principle on which platforms  
like Coursera work. Coursera is a for-profit educational technology  
company offering extensive open-online courses founded by computer  
science professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, from Stanford Uni-  
versity. Due to the huge number of students, the professors are not able  
to read all papers, so they delegate the task to students, giving them  
strict rules to follow. We can apply the same principle to the crowd to  
summarize the results or other kinds of data. It is obvious that by using  
online technologies and the help of the crowd, the cost of our research  
will be less expensive yet with better quality.  
Phase Two\: Design. Most people decide to start a career in the field  
of events because of the creativity involved in organizing them. Perhaps  
the best way to enhance your creativity continually is to surround your-  
self with highly creative people. Whether you are in a position to hire  
creative individuals or must seek for creative types in groups outside the  
office, you must find the innovators in order to be innovative yourself  
in your field. It is crowdsourcing that gives you a unique opportunity  
to tap not only into the creativity of your team but also to involve the  
participation of people from all over the world through the timely appli-  
cation of discussions and focus groups and, at the same time, relying on  
all other sources of information available to you thanks to the Internet.  
A reasonable event practitioner would avail of all the benefits of modern  
technologies in order to take advantage of the knowledge and expertise  
of the finest professionals in their respective fields. Last but not least, for  
questions of great significance, which you have to analyze at this phase—  
namely, what, why, who, when, and where—you can use the power of theCrowdsourcing for Events ² 303  
crowd. In most cases event professionals ask former participants various  
questions. However, nowadays we can easily turn to future participants  
and professionals. Mind that the question “why’’ we should do an event is  
a crucial one. After finding its answer, we can use the help of the Internet  
society to meet more adequately the needs and expectations of guests  
who will be attending our event. Thus, we can meet the questions of who,  
when, and where more confidently and with greater precision.  
At the same time we have to create criteria for the evaluation of all  
ideas that we will come across, as we are well aware of the goals of our  
event and what results to expect in the end.  
■ What refers to questions about ideas related to the format of the  
event and the adjustment of our plans.  
■ Who refers to questions about ideas for speakers, musicians,  
hosts, etc., or what kind of participants we need in order to  
reach new potential guests.  
■ When is an easy question considering its numerous options—  
at least 365 per year. We have to use this query to find out the  
motives of our respondents, which would help us the most  
appropriate date.  
■ Where is an important question because even an experienced  
event specialist might neglect a very popular place that their  
target group would rather choose to frequent.  
All in all, the second phase is the one that can mostly benefit from  
crowdsourcing.  
Phase Three\: Planning. As we are well aware, the planning phase  
involves using time/space/tempo laws. That phase is closely related to  
the work of your team, and crowdsourcing can be used to find the best  
solution concerning more challenging tasks. Reliance on your own  
team is particularly important at this phase. A good point to consider  
is how to use crowdsourcing for the promotion of your event. Such  
tactics have to be planned carefully and executed with great accuracy.304 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
One of the most conspicuous examples of how to use the power of the  
crowd can be derived from Barack Obama’s campaign for President in  
2008\. Barack Obama has been called Advertising Age’s marketer of the  
year for 2008 \(Creamer, 2008\). Mr. Obama won the vote of hundreds  
of marketers, agency heads, and marketing-service vendors gathered  
at the Association of National Advertisers’ annual conference. One of  
its strongest and most impressive features of the campaign was the way  
it motivated the crowd to work for the sake of the campaign. In 2009  
PR agency Edelman published “Barack Obama’s Social Media Toolkit”,  
where you can find a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses  
of election campaigns \(Lutz, 2009\).  
Phase Four\: Coordination. This is the most obvious part of event  
planning, which is the real event itself. How can crowdsourcing help us  
at this point? If you take into consideration the enormous power of vol-  
unteers, you will find the answer you need. Human resources should be  
at the focus of our attention because they are always in demand, being  
crucial for the success of any event. The power of the crowd can help  
you discover people with a strong sense of dedication who would be  
willing to help you in conducting your event. So, do not hesitate to ask  
for volunteers because there are always people who will be motivated  
enough to become part of your event. What you need to do is find them  
and offer the best proposal and suitable rewards. It looks quite easy,  
doesn’t it? On many occasions volunteers make up an integral part of  
the event  
Phase Five\: Evaluation. It is not so easy to leave the last phase of  
the process to the power of the crowd. That’s a task that you have to do  
by yourself. Of course, there is a way to get help. For example, partici-  
pants can be encouraged to make and share photos and videos, which  
can be used in the evaluation process. Modern event evaluation tech-  
niques allow us to use different methods for evaluation, while pictures  
and videos can help us to detect the participant’s point of view.  
To sum up, although crowdsourcing can help us in every phase of  
the management process, it is most efficient during the research and  
design phases.Crowdsourcing for Events ² 305  
According to Ross Dawson, a globally recognized futurist and a  
strategy advisor, “We are now at the opening phases of what is a global  
talent economy. Talent is now everywhere and far more available. We’re  
seeing professionals increasingly working independently rather than  
necessarily in large corporations; we are seeing retired people who are  
interested in continuing to be engaged and entrusted to projects. And,  
clearly, we have access to people around the world. So, we are moving  
from a world where the talent was all inside big organizations to a very  
fluid world where the talent is available globally. And there is now a  
whole host of tools and platforms to be able to access all of this talent  
in a wide variety of ways” \(Davey, 2010\). It is beyond doubt that crowd-  
sourcing is here to stay and that it could help us in organizing better  
events. Yet we also agree that whatever we do, we need to work out a  
good strategy for how to be most efficient and successful. In his book  
Crowdsourcing, Jeff Howe \(2009\) distinguishes four primary strategies  
that can also be applied to events. They are based on the four different  
types of crowdsourcing we have already discussed earlier.  
■ Crowd Voting. According to Howe, crowd voting is the most  
popular form of crowdsourcing because it generates the highest  
levels of participation. Crowd voting is also used as a marketing  
tool to develop contest campaigns.  
■ Crowd Wisdom. According to Howe, “Given the right set of con-  
ditions, the crowd will almost always outperform any number of  
employees, a fact that many companies are increasingly attempt-  
ing to exploit.” The best example of this type of crowdsourcing  
strategy could be Wikipedia, a tool that is used by thousands of  
people all over the world every day.  
■ Crowdcreation. This can be defined as activities such as asking  
individuals to film TV commercials, perform language trans-  
lation, or solve challenging scientific problems. This strategy is  
combined with crowd voting to create marketing campaigns.  
■ Crowdfunding. This describes the collective cooperation, atten-  
tion, and trust by people who network and pool their money and  
other resources together to finance or help individuals or groups  
who usually cannot finance their projects through other means.306 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Thus, it is important to decide what our aspirations are and weave  
crowdsourcing strategy into the whole planning process of the event.  
After you have created your crowdsourcing strategy, you have to  
choose the tools that you will use to execute your strategy.  
One of the greatest benefits in using crowdsourcing is that you  
stimulate the competition of ideas and solutions; you create an envi-  
ronment in which a collective effort is a must, in which everyone can  
learn new things.  
Using social media for your crowdsourcing tasks in the planning  
process of your event can be really creative, fun, and effective. You will  
just need to find the most efficient tool for each crowd. We cannot pos-  
sibly discuss the whole range of available tools in detail. Nonetheless,  
we will take a closer look at some of the currently most popular ones.  
TWITTER  
Needless to say, what you definitely have to bear in mind in case  
you decide to use Twitter is to create a unique hashtag \(\#\) to explain  
clearly what you want to accomplish and to have followers, who  
will be tweeted. In Figure 14.2 you can see the process of using  
Figure 14.2. Crowdsourcing on Twitter \(Source\: Zoomerang, part of Sur-  
veyMonkey Inc., Palo Alto, California, USA, www.surveymonkey.com, Used  
with permission.\) Crowdsourcing for Events ² 307  
crowdsourcing for surveys on Twitter. As we have already discussed  
earlier, it would be reasonable and useful to offer some kind of  
incentives to those who will participate. Actually, that is the missing  
thing in Figure 14.2.  
FACEBOOK  
If we are looking for a big crowd, Facebook is, certainly, the right  
place. As of May 2014, Facebook has as many as 900,000,000 esti-  
mated unique monthly visitors \(eBizMB, 2015\). Thus, we cannot  
escape the network if our goal is to reach the biggest possible crowd  
in the world. Relying on our previous experience and research, we  
Figure 14.3. Facebook Crowdsourcing \(Source\: Kerr, 2014\) 308 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
have arrived at the conclusion that crowdsourcing with consum-  
ers can result in greater customer satisfaction and can increase in a  
positive way the word-of-mouth contacts among participants. It is  
nearly impossible to hold an event today without creating an event  
on Facebook. You can use different applications to ask questions,  
share ideas, search for solutions, etc. For example, The Wall Street  
Journal asked its readers on Facebook to share what they considered  
interesting and exciting in the job market and highlighted some of  
the submitted stories in an article. Among the most popular tools  
used on Facebook, the following ones stand out\: contests, polls, and  
surveys \(Lavrusik, 2011\).  
PINTEREST  
The fact that Pinterest counts on pictures organized in sections makes  
it easy to attract new people to your cause. You have to be aware, how-  
ever, that a female population dominates Pinterest. Using Pinterest you  
can find out how your event fits into the lives of your guests and gain  
important insights into improving your creative strategy or event posi-  
tioning. As with all crowdsourcing activities, you have to focus more  
on being inspirational rather than on technical factors, as people in  
a crowd are on the lookout for inspiration and opportunities to show  
their knowledge, not to be confronted with boring stuff.  
INSTAGRAM  
Instagram is the place where smartphone users publish their pictures.  
So if pictures are part of your crowdsourcing efforts, Instagram is the  
right place for you. Users can follow other users, which in turn can be  
followed as well. Pictures can be “liked” and commented on. It is a well-  
known fact that people love to watch the activities they are part of in  
progress, which can be achieved most effectively by pictures. Moreover,  
Instagram users are mainly young adults. In other words, if they are  
your target, photos make up an important part of your crowdsourcing  
strategy and you have to be on Instagram.Crowdsourcing for Events ² 309  
Figure 14.4. How to Use Google Plus for Crowdsourcing  
GOOGLE PLUS  
There are 300 million active users in the Google + Stream. Google+ user  
base comprises roughly 60% males and 25% females as of November 2013  
\(Imparture, 2014\). As we know quite well, all our crowdsourcing efforts  
are aimed at reaching the maximum number of people, thus we have  
to know how to reach that goal. In Figure 14.4 you will find some tips  
in using G+. A very important step is to add people who responded to  
your question to a circle in which you will be sharing the results from the  
crowdsourcing question. That will make them feel personally connected  
to your post, having contributed to it in some way, and will hopefully help  
you get the word out.  
YOUTUBE  
In short, the video is the king of the content movement nowadays, sur-  
passing everything else in its impact on people. With this in mind, you  
have to consider and plan carefully in advance how to use video con-  
tent for your crowdsourcing efforts. There are two main ways\: Sharing  
by video your call for action or encouraging people to create video that  
will meet your needs. And, of course, it could be a combination of both  
—asking people for ideas and executing those ideas in video format.310 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Just remember the “Happy” video wave, and your imagination will help  
you come up with plenty of great ideas.  
SLIDESHARE  
Presentations are the real standard for business today. Using and shar-  
ing presentations could become a convenient and efficient contribution  
to your crowdsourcing efforts.  
SCRIBD  
Provided that people need to read various materials before becoming  
part of your crowdsourcing efforts, using Scribd might be a smart deci-  
sion. Scribd is a digital library featuring a subscription service with  
premier books including New York Times bestsellers and classics.  
It will not be possible here to take a closer look at all the platforms  
that you can use in practice. However, you have to be curious to find  
new platforms and what people can do with them.  
Although social networks can be helpful, don’t forget that there are  
numerous other websites you can use to work efficiently in collabora-  
tion, among which Evernote, Google Drive, Get Satisfaction, Delicious,  
and Dropbox are worth mentioning.  
The process of crowdsourcing is now easy and convenient because  
of the huge penetration of Internet. Figure 14.5 presents the scheme of  
the process. In this process there is a wide range of platforms that can  
help you become more efficient.

We cannot possibly encompass all online platforms which you can  
use in your practice. Besides, we are sure that when you read this sec-  
tion of the book, there is bound to be something new online for you.  
Nevertheless, we will touch upon some of the currently most popular  
crowdsourcing tools to provide an overall impression of some possible  
expectations\:  
■ crowdSPRING \(crowdspring.com\) helps people from around  
the world get access to creative talent, as well as all those with a  
more a creative streak to find new customers across the globe.  
In other words it is an online marketplace for crowdsourcing  
logo designs, web designs, graphic designs, industrial designs,  
and writing services.  
■ 99designs \(99designs.com\) is an online graphic design mar-  
ketplace that enables customers to source graphic design work  
quickly.  
■ oDesk \(odesk.com\) is a global job marketplace with a series  
of tools targeted at businesses that intend to hire and manage  
workers from distant and remote backgrounds.  
■ Microworkers \(microworkers.com\) is a platform by which you  
can crowdsource your micro jobs to more than 500,000 work-  
ers worldwide.  
■ Innocentive \(innocentive.com\) is a global platform in crowd-  
sourcing innovation problems set up for the world’s most edu-  
cated and intelligent people who compete to provide ideas and  
solutions for important business, social, political, scientific, or  
technical challenges. Its global network of millions of problem  
solvers, proven challenge methodology, and cloud-based tech-  
nology are combined in order to help clients transform their  
economics of innovation through rapid solution delivery and the  
development of sustainable, open innovation programs.  
As you may assume, crowdsourcing is a big phenomenon.  
Crowdfunding is part of that new movement. Although the practice312 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
of crowdfunding is not completely new for the event industry, the  
concept is still formally recognized as a new industry by numerous  
consumers. Crowdfunding is by definition “the practice of funding a  
project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a  
large number of people, typically via the Internet.” If we have to adapt  
the definition to the event industry, it will look as follows\: It is, in  
fact, the practice of funding an event by raising many small amounts  
of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.

as donating money for events are practices that we have been famil-  
iar with for long time. One might wonder what is new about it. Of  
course, the great novelty is the Internet along with the great variety of  
opportunities available to us that will help us improve the quality of  
events. If we go back to the 5W questions, the most important query  
for crowdfunding is Why. People will be motivated to fund our event  
if they care not so much about what you do, but why you do it. By  
focusing on the bigger, long-term goals, the driving force behind an  
event, we will be able to create a unique community of like-minded  
individuals.  
According to Tanya Prive \(2012\), contributor at Forbes, there are  
three main reasons why people unconnected to a project or business  
would support it\:5  
1\. They connect to the greater purpose of the campaign  
2\. They connect to a physical aspect of the campaign, like the  
rewards  
3\. They connect to the creative display of the campaign’s presentation  
If we replace the word campaign with event, we will get a brand  
new sound basis for our crowdfunding strategy in setting up an  
event\:  
1\. They connect to the greater purpose of the event  
2\. They connect to a physical aspect of the event, like the rewards  
3\. They connect to the creative display of the event’s presentation  
Following these guiding rules and using some of the top crowd-  
funding platforms, you can organize and execute an impressive, pur-  
poseful event.  
In fact, all these sites create an online community of people who  
care about your cause \(event\) and are ready to follow your progress and  
help you in achieving your goal. And, in fact, that means much more  
than receiving just financial support.314 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Jason Graf \(2013\) from CrowdIt in an article published in Busi-  
ness News Daily outlines 15 simple ways to increase the odds of  
crowdsourcing success. Among them are the use of video, offering  
pledges which secure 20–30% of the desired funding, setting real-  
istic goals, creating a great pitch, creating a page, showing who you  
are, sharing as many details as possible, showcasing unique goods,  
and offering rewards and incentives. Not forgetting the fact that it  
should be personal will help you develop a personal approach and get  
used to communicating frequently with the crowd. It’s important to  
be passionate about your event and not to give up. As with all events,  
it is important to keep your promises and commitments, express your  
gratitude to those who have helped you, and share what you have  
achieved together.  
According to statistics, a typical donation is \$75 on average \(Graf,  
2013\).  
It is important to point out the significance of crowdsourcing  
and crowdfunding principles, which have a lot in common with your  
events. The following may serve as an example of how the above-men-  
tioned factors can transform events and make them gain an ever wider  
scope.  
We would like to draw your attention to the phenomenon called  
“crowd-accelerated innovation”. This term was coined by Chris  
Anderson \(2010\), the curator of the TED Conference in 2002. In a  
TEDTalk he talks about how he “became intrigued by a different way  
of thinking of large human crowds, because there are circumstances  
where they can do something really cool. It’s a phenomenon that any  
organization or individual can tap into.” To use this phenomenon  
effectively, you need three things. Think of them as three dials on a  
giant wheel, and when you turn up the dials, the wheel starts turning.  
Those things are\:  
■ Crowd. A group of people who share a common interest. The  
bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are.Crowdsourcing for Events ² 315  
■ Light. This refers to a clear, open visibility of what the best peo-  
ple in that crowd are capable of, because that is the way to learn  
how to gain the necessary power to participate effectively.  
■ Desire. With the absence of desire, nothing is bound to happen.  
We have already examined closely the first two elements. As regards  
the third one, desire, we have touched upon it only in the extract con-  
cerning rewards. Yet one must not forget that desire is of prime impor-  
tance, as it proves why people will want to become part of the crowd.  
The secret of desire lies in your answer to the questions Why and Who.  
Remember that people want to be part of something big, something  
they believe in, and, last but not least, to be in a great company. To sum  
it up, without desire the crowd will not respond.  
If desire is the crucial ingredient about a crowd, light is the tricky  
part from the point of view of event organizers, “because it means you  
have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world. It’s by giving  
away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of peo-  
ple are empowered to help improve it” \(Anderson, 2010\).  
TED has two successful initiatives in crowdsourcing. First, by open-  
ing up their translation program, thousands of volunteers have trans-  
lated TEDtalks into more than 70 languages. The latter makes videos  
from their conferences easy to watch all over the world. The word-of-  
mouth phenomenon is out there, as people translate and talk to their  
friends about what they have done and why. And second, by giving away  
the TEDx brand, they suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments  
in the art of spreading ideas. In May 2014 TED celebrated its 10,000th  
event, TEDx! Since its start in 2009, TEDx events have been held in as  
many as 167 countries, at an average rate of eight per day. Imagine this  
—8 events per day done by a great crowd of people willing to help you  
spread ideas.  
You have certainly watched at least one TEDTalk. And if a TED  
conference can tap on the power of the crowd in such a splendid way,  
why not at least give it a go?316 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
CONCLUSION  
At the end of his first article about crowdsourcing Jeff Howe wrote that  
the term “crowdsourcing owes a debt to James Surowiecki’s eye-open-  
ing and entertaining book, The Wisdom of Crowds. But as Surowiecki,  
himself notes in that book, we both owe a further debt to Charles Mac-  
kay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, a  
work from the early Victorian era that should be a required reading for  
anyone interested in the subject” \(Surowiecki, 2005; Howe, 2006\). If you  
want to get a deeper insight into the idea of crowdsourcing and crowd-  
funding, a great starting point is to read those two books. If you ask  
yourself what the crowd can do for you, you are heading in the wrong  
direction. You have to ask yourself what you can do for the crowd.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. What will motivate you to become part of a crowd?  
2\. What other examples of a crowdsourcing event, except TED,  
can you list?  
3\. What are your attitudes to crowdsourcing as a power in mod-  
ern society?  
4\. How would you crowdsource a local new sports event?  
TASK  
Try to become part of a crowdsourcing effort in which you are inter-  
ested. Visit the platform we discussed here and take part in a task. What  
do you think? What have you learned that can be useful in making  
events and using the power of the crowd to do better events?

321 322 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
INTRODUCTION  
When meeting and event management was first developed within  
higher education, we understood that a special event has clear begin-  
ning and clear end. However, since the development of the Internet,  
social media, and networks has become an integral part of everyday  
life, we can say that this knowledge is no longer true. As a result of  
global technological networks, events today are without end. Events are  
indeed now a never-ending story.  
At one time we were taught that the successful event has to create  
a community of people and to have positive social impacts upon the  
environment. At that time it was a huge challenge for us, as for a com-  
munity to endure, we needed channels for communication. During  
that time, communication was slow and expensive. Now to communi-  
cate with huge groups of people, you need just a device and an Internet  
connection. We can say that one of the biggest challenges in event man-  
agement can be more easily overcome. But the second one—to create  
events with a more positive impact upon society—remains a difficult  
challenge for every event manager.  
Regardless of the mass penetration of technologies in our life, we  
still need face-to-face communication with people. This is confirmed  
by a study of 7,000 meeting and event planners who stated that their  
preference was to blend online with face-to-face learning to create bet-  
ter outcomes \(McEuen and Duffy, 2010\).  
The data collected from organizations such as Meeting Profession-  
als International and the Professional Convention Management Asso-  
ciation \(World Tourism Organization, 2014\) clearly shows that the  
number of organized events is not just stable but is growing. Events are  
a permanent fixture in our lives. They have been an integral part of all  
human history and will be with us forever. That’s not to say that events  
didn’t change in the last decade.  
Events have changed significantly, and many more changes will  
enter the field in future decades. What exactly will change? No oneFuturistic Tech Trends That Will Influence Our Events knows for sure, but by analyzing what happens we can forecast and  
then to see if they will became a reality. Here we will focus our attention  
only on those possible changes that are connected with technology.  
For example, in the year 2000, Professor Joe Goldblatt \(2013\) deliv-  
ered a lecture in Sydney, Australia, describing his forecast for events in  
the new millennia. Goldblatt forecast that the majority of meeting and  
event registrations would be transacted online in the first decade of the  
twenty-first century. This forecast was accurate. He also forecast that by  
2015 event planners would be broadcasting events from planets besides  
our own planet Earth. While this has not been achieved, it may indeed  
occur in the future as national governments continue the space race  
to Mars and other planet. Finally, Goldblatt forecast that in the year  
2025 many events would have full robotic capacity, thereby reducing  
the need for some human labor. Once again, while robotics has sig-  
nificantly developed in recent years, we will not be able to confirm this  
trend until these devices are more generally utilized and adapted by the  
meetings and events planners of the future.  
If we try to focus on all the new meeting and event technologically  
friendly gadgets, this chapter will be out of date before you finish it.  
² 323  
However, there are some emerging and new technological tools that  
merit further examination.  
We will start with Google Glass. There are already plenty of appli-  
cations popping up all over the place for this incredible pair of glasses.  
There are yet numerous applications of Google Glass at events. The two  
main applications for our industry are in ticketing and livestreaming.324 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
Event staff can immediately scan event tickets by wearing Glass  
or attendees can scan an intelligent code to get clearance. Secondly  
live-streaming is the most logic use of Glass, thanks to hangout inte-  
gration.  
You can list many more applications.  
In the 60 Minutes television show on the American television net-  
work, CBS, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed that Prime Air delivery  
by drone could be a very real possibility in the not too distant future  
\(Rose, 2013\). A drone is an aircraft that has the capability of autono-  
mous flight. A drone can follow a mission from point to point without  
a pilot on board. Drones are typically guided by Geographical Position-  
ing Systems \(GPS\), but soon this will also be possible through vision  
and other sensors. With a drone we can explore the limits of our imag-  
ination to create a better experience for our guests through helping  
manage deliveries, observations, and even monitoring crowd control.  
Crowd management and control is one of the most important  
issues in the meetings and events industry. We do not have precise  
technology that empirically provides details regarding crowd move-  
ment. The Internet of Things \(IOT\) is a technology trend that has had  
little impact so far on events. Google is at the forefront of IOT innova-  
tion. With IOT we can measure temperature, humidity, light, pressure  
\(including nearby footfalls\), motion, air quality, and both RF \(radio  
frequency\) and ambient noise. All of the data is sent back at intervalsFuturistic Tech Trends That Will Influence Our Events of 20 seconds or so, collected by Google’s App Engine, with analysis  
performed by its BigQuery Big Data analysis tool.  
It is not possible to list all of the new and emerging technologies  
that will impact the meetings and events in the future. The list will not  
be up to date when you read it. Instead we will try to focus on some of  
the major trends connected with these technologies.  
THE HYBRID STANDARD  
Did you know that Ferdinand Porsche developed the first gasoline-elec-  
tric hybrid automobile in the world in 1901? It took nearly a century for  
the hybrid-electric vehicles to become widely available. In 1997, we saw  
in Japan the introduction of the Toyota Prius, followed by the Honda  
Insight in 1999.  
One major trend in meetings and events is the hybridization  
between the face-to-face \(live\) and virtual \(online\) experience. Many  
meetings and events industry associations have demonstrated through  
online as well as face-to-face registrations that hybrid meetings and  
events are indeed a major trend.  
■ Hybrid meetings will be an important part of the industry’s  
future. In the MPI study, seventy percent of respondents felt  
that hybrid meetings would be important to the future of meet-  
ings, though further analysis reveals that meeting professionals  
are still becoming familiar with the medium.  
■ The hybrid meetings movement hasn’t gained critical mass.  
Fifty percent of the MPI respondents have never organized a  
hybrid event, and another 25 percent have never attended or  
even helped to organize a hybrid event.  
■ Technology is not the only factor in the success of a hybrid  
event. While many meeting professionals cite technology as  
a barrier to the success of a hybrid event, others also point to  
people, processes, and formats.  
² 325 326 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
We may argue that hybrid events are a permanent fixture of meet-  
ings and events. Through hybridization, attendees receive more infor-  
mation before, during, and following the meeting or event, and online  
events are not as rare as they were five years ago. As part of our future  
ability to harness and expand the power of meeting and event manage-  
ment, we will have to further develop our knowledge of hybrid events  
and learn how to plan, organize, and evaluate them.  
LOCAL MEANS GLOBAL  
Thanks to new technologies every single local event now has the poten-  
tial of going global. That is a huge change as we are used to think about  
our local events as only local and dedicated to the local community.  
Now they are going global and can reach the global community. With  
this in mind, we have to think simultaneously about local aspects and  
global reach. This shift has to happen first in our mindset, and after that  
we can find ways to became part of every single local event. What does  
it means in meetings and events management?  
Here are a few key technological considerations\:  
■ Language and translation of information about the event  
■ Compliance with different cultures and traditions  
■ Being open to different points of view  
■ Planning in accordance with time differences  
■ Being aware that local publicity can quickly became global  
news.  
Of course, millions of local face-to-face meetings and events will be  
conducted in the future. Local meetings and events are part of our cul-  
ture and heritage, but now they can and will reach global audiences via  
the Internet. Guests will share opinions, photos, and experiences with  
their global networks in different social platforms. If you manage the  
globalization of local events, you can achieve better results and reach  
people all over the world.Futuristic Tech Trends That Will Influence Our Events ² 327  
MOBILE LIVING  
How often do you use mobile communications devices such as smart-  
phones and tablets for Internet access as compared to desktop com-  
puters? More and more we prefer to use the mobile devices in our  
pocket. According to Morgan Stanley, mobile web usage has signifi-  
cantly increased over traditional desktop web browsing between 2007  
and 2015.  
So what does that mean for meetings and events management? We  
have to adapt our stereotype of online communication to a new mobile  
reality. We have to make the transition in our mentality from desktop  
communication to mobile communication, and we need to use differ-  
ent applications for creating a better experience for our guests.  
AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES  
3D movies and television shows are increasingly more prevalent. The  
consequences of that 3D experience are that we want to have authentic  
experiences in all our activities. We want to see, hear, feel, smell, taste,  
and touch to gain a new experience of the world around us. Today aug-  
mented reality is the new thing in tech and media circles. It’s expensive,  
and few events organizers can afford it, but soon it will be an integral part  
of a different kind of events. We can expect that the number in front of  
the D will grow, and we will want to have 4D, 5D, etc. technologies. There  
are many applications that help us to use augmented reality to create a  
better experience for an event’s guests. The challenge for us is to under-  
stand the technology, to understand the needs of our guests, and to find  
the perfect match between our intentions to use newest technologies and  
to keep the focus on the personal experience of each single guest.  
SUSTAINABLE MEETINGS AND EVENTS  
WITH TECHNOLOGY  
In 2012, after the hard work of experts from all over the world, the first  
ISO certificate for environmental sustainability in event management328 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
was publicly announced. ISO 20121\:2012 event sustainability manage-  
ment systems are only one of the signs that people are more and more  
concerned with the environment and they want to consume ethically.  
New technologies can help event organizers to reduce waste, to be  
friendly to environment, and to be concerned with what footprint is  
left after the event ends.  
The global trend of sustainability is changing the practice of events  
all over the world, and new technologies are here to help us make sus-  
tainable events. Simply greening our event is not enough. People expect  
more from event organizers. Good practices have become known glob-  
ally, and we have to be aware of the best cases and try to move to the  
highest standard in our profession.  
EVENTS AS SOCIAL CAPITAL  
What does “social capital” mean? The central premise of social capital  
is that social networks have value. Social capital refers to the collective  
value of all “social networks” \(who people know\) and the inclinations  
that arise from these networks to do things for each other \(“norms of  
reciprocity”\). Thanks to social media and networks, we can share what  
we are doing, where we are doing it, with whom, etc. Smart event man-  
agers have to focus on the opportunity to convert their events in the  
important currency of social capital. According to Future Foundation  
\(2014\), “The forthcoming decade will be defined strongly by the abil-  
ity to accumulate social capital.” People share information using their  
personal networks. They choose what to share and with whom. Events  
managers have to be aware of the importance of social capital and to  
use their imagination in combination with new technologies to trans-  
form and create events to take advantage of the important currency of  
social capital.  
CO-CREATED EVENTS  
When using new technologies, consumers not only consume products  
and services; they also create the reputation of the brand. The same isFuturistic Tech Trends That Will Influence Our Events ² 329  
true for the reputation of events. We have discussed the crowdsourcing  
practice. In the future new technologies will help people to become a  
more integral part of events, and we have to be prepared for that kind  
of cooperation.  
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1\. What are some of the obstacles to conducting hybrid meetings  
and events?  
2\. What do you believe are some further demographic and social  
trends that will impact the future development of technological  
solutions for meetings and events?  
3\. What new technologies will be needed to improve the evalua-  
tion of meetings and events in the future?  
TASK  
Work with a small team of students to develop a plan for a new mobile  
application for the meetings and events industry that will increase  
attendance and improve the overall experience for your attendees.

# Case Studies  
CASE \#1\: CRASHING WI-FI AT FIRST PAPERLESS  
MEETING  
Ten thousand biologists attended a scientific conference in Barcelona,  
Spain. This conference was one of the first to provide a paperless expe-  
rience for the delegates. All of the schedule, social event information,  
abstracts and other critical information would be provided from the  
cloud. However, within the first ten minutes of the meeting the con-  
ference centre information services manager told the meeting planner  
that their Wi-Fi system could not handle 10,000 persons logging on  
simultaneously, and their system had indeed crashed.  
The Challenge  
When the delegates could not access their critical information from  
the cloud, chaos ensued. Hundreds of delegates stood in long lines at  
the registration and help desks asking for paper copies of the schedule,  
abstracts, and social event information. The meeting planner received  
thousands of irate e-mails. Various scientific online chatrooms we filled  
with posted complaints about the meeting.  
The Opportunity  
The meeting planner could have had a backup system in case of sys-  
temic failure. One potential backup was to collect e-mails and mobile  
331 332 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
numbers from all delegates and then send them messages directing  
them to alternative sites to collect their information.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
You should meet with the venue information services manager and dis-  
cuss back up plans in case the Wi-Fi system fails. You should have this  
issue highlighted in your risk management plan. When interviewing  
for future jobs in the meetings and events industry, you should describe  
how you would handle disruptions in technology before, during, and  
after your meeting or event.  
CASE \#2\: FAILURE OF ELECTRONIC TICKETING SYSTEM  
A new electronic ticketing system has been installed for a major Euro-  
pean arts and cultural festival. Within a few hours of usage, the system  
fails and there is massive confusion as tickets are not printed, financial  
transactions are not conducted, and customers are extremely irate as  
they are missing the performances they wish to attend.  
The Challenge  
The new ticketing system did not have a redundant platform to replace  
the faulty original system. As a result, ticket buyers had to be issued  
handwritten paper tickets or in some cases had their hands stamped  
with a rubber stamp after paying for their tickets with cash. This led to  
massive errors regarding cash handling and a 25 percent decline in box  
office transactions.  
The Opportunity  
The arts and cultural festival organizers should have used a redun-  
dant system approach so that if there was a failure they could switch  
to plan B to satisfy the needs of their guests. The original systemMeeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 333  
should have undergone and extensive period of live testing prior to  
implementation.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When applying for a new job, describe how you would select, develop,  
test, and implement a new online registration or ticketing system.  
Describe your plan for creating a redundant system and how you will  
communicate in real time with attendees and ticket buyers so that they  
are aware of how to complete their transaction. Describe how you will  
practice due diligence when appointing a registration or ticketing firm  
to provide services for your meeting or event.  
CASE \#3\: DELAYED ELECTRONIC TICKET DELIVERY  
Millions of tickets are placed on sale for a mega sports event. Within  
a few days, ticket purchasers are receiving messages saying that due to  
an overwhelming response for tickets, there will be delays. Ticket pur-  
chasers fear that they will not receive the tickets they desire and begin  
to e-mail the organizer and also post negative messages on social media  
sites.  
The Challenge  
One of the major challenges with selling large numbers of tickets is the  
wide range of broadband capacity of the potential buyers. The ticket  
seller has little to no control over individual broadband width and  
capacity and this may slow the dissemination of tickets.  
The Opportunity  
Ticket buyers should be informed in advance of the challenges of  
broadband capacity and offered alternative ways to obtain tickets or to  
register. Alternatives may include telephone, e-mail, in person at box  
office, and even through text messaging.334 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When applying for a future meeting or event job, let your employer  
know that you have a wide range of effective solutions to distribute  
tickets or collect registrations for your event. Describe each solution  
and compare and contrast the benefits for the meeting and event plan-  
ning organization as well as the participants.  
CASE \#4\: SECURITY FAILURE OF PERSONAL  
ELECTRONIC DATA  
The hard drive of your association headquarters has been hacked, result-  
ing in the massive theft of thousands of individual records, including  
health information about your members.  
The Challenge  
One of your staff members is married to a member of the media and  
mentions this theft to her husband who quickly informs his editor, and  
a story soon appears on page one of the local newspaper.  
The Opportunity  
It is impossible to provide 100 percent security when using online sys-  
tems. Therefore, you must develop a risk aversion, risk management  
and risk control policy to protect the data entrusted to your organiza-  
tion. This policy must identify key leaders who will serve as stewards of  
this information and when there is a breach of security implement the  
procedures identified through your policies.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When applying for a job, tell your interviewer how important it is  
to protect the information entrusted to your organization. DescribeMeeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 335  
examples of policies that you would follow or implement to reduce risk  
associated with data protection.  
CASE \#5\: NEGATIVE ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK ON YOUR  
MEETING VENUE  
TripAdvisor.com suddenly has a large number of negative reviews  
posted about your upcoming convention hotel. As a result, your orga-  
nization is receiving a number of e-mail queries from potential reg-  
istrants, and some current attendees are asking for refunds from the  
hotel and desire to book rooms outside of your contracted block.  
The Challenge  
The individuals posting negative reviews on TripAdvisor.com are lei-  
sure tourists whose individual complaints have now gone viral as  
other guests receive e-mail notices about this hotel property. You must  
quickly ensure that accurate information is being disseminated to your  
current and potential attendees.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When applying for a future job, discuss the importance of third-party  
social media referral sites such as TripAdvisor.com and describe how you  
would organize a group of your meetings and events participants to refute  
negative reviews on these sites. Also describe how you will effectively  
communicate with your future and current participants to ensure them  
that you are investigating these complaints and will report back with your  
findings in a reasonable amount of time. To reduce the number of persons  
who attempt to book outside your convention hotel block, remind them  
of the value of staying in the headquarters hotel \(increased networking,  
efficient use of time, your ability to leverage your position and act on their  
behalf\) and the potential penalties for moving outside the hotel \(a cash  
penalty imposed by your association, loss of time when walking to and  
from the headquarters hotel, loss of key networking opportunities.336 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
CASE \#6\: LIVE EVENT IDEAS WORTH TRANSLATING  
When the organizers of the conference TED created TED.com and  
uploaded videos from the TEDTalks, the interest was tremendous. The  
videos were all in English language. Although English is spoken by  
many people around the world, the sole use of English became a bar-  
rier for spreading the ideas globally. The TED community was growing  
and the idea of translating TEDTalks began to gain interest. Passionate  
viewers around the world started asking if they could translate talks in  
order to share them with friends and family. If that could happen, then  
the Talks from the conference would be able to reach even more people  
who do not speak English, and they would be inspired by the ideas that  
TED speakers shared.  
The Challenge  
The real need and an opportunity to radically open accessibility to  
TEDTalks by developing a translation system that would allow volun-  
teers to translate their favorite talks into any language. Another chal-  
lenge was to guarantee the best quality of the translations.  
The Opportunity  
Making TEDTalks available in many languages, the TED conference  
promises “ideas worth spreading” and is going one step further. TED  
launched in 2009 The Open Translation Project. It started with 300  
translations in 40 languages, created by 200 volunteer translators. And  
the heart of the project is that before going public, the translation should  
be reviewed by a volunteer. TED encourages translators to know each  
other and to work together for offering better translations to millions  
of people. Today, more than 50,000 translations have been published in  
104 languages \(and counting\), created by more than 15,000 volunteers.  
Recently, the project expanded to include the transcription and trans-  
lation of TEDxTalks, the translation of TED-Ed lessons, the localiza-  
tion of TED’s Android app and the translation of content distributed by  
worldwide partners that help grow TED’s global footprint.Meeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 337  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Being a volunteer creates enormous opportunities for gaining expe-  
rience, creating good business networks, and acquiring knowledge of  
what happens behind the scene at events. Through providing volunteer  
translation services, you can gain invaluable experience and generate  
important contacts. The only thing you need is idea worth spreading.  
CASE \#7\: WHEN EVENT TECHNOLOGY EXPECTATIONS  
ARE HIGHER  
A big multinational electronics company announced the first 3D map-  
ping event. The event was advertised broadly and attracted many peo-  
ple who were eager to see with their own eyes the newest technology.  
Their expectations were huge due to the rapid growth of the Internet.  
The Challenge  
The temperatures were high and the beginning of the event was not  
properly design. People were made to wait for more than two hours  
before the actual 3D mapping started. When the time came, the file  
drop and the organizers tried to broadcast the movie more than five  
times with no success. The people viewing the event on the outdoor  
public square viewed five times the first minute of the movie. The dis-  
appointment of the audience started appearing almost immediately on  
social media.  
The Opportunity  
When you create huge expectations, you have to be ready to deliver.  
The world is now a small village, and people know what to expect when  
attending a professional event. Event organizers have to plan the start-  
ing hour more carefully and work closely with the technical staff to  
overcome the high temperatures and ensure the weather will not be a  
problem for the computers to broadcast the 3D mapping film.338 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When organizing an event to present a new technology, be careful in  
creating expectations. Sometimes is better to be honest and to present  
what will really work rather than take chances. Sometimes is better to  
be good, than to be first.  
CASE \#8\: LIVE EVENT COVERAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA  
Every event organizer knows that social media is an integral part of  
each event. In this case, the maintenance of social media content was  
left to the youngest in the team who had good knowledge of new social  
media but did not have experience in creating content during the event.  
The Challenge  
Today people expect to receive content through social media nearly  
simultaneously with the happening of the event. That means that  
depending on the size of the event, you need dedicated staff from your  
event team who will perform only this function during the event.  
The Opportunity  
The best in the field don’t rely on chance. If you want to create coverage  
from your event at the moment things happen, you have to prepare  
everything before the event. That means to write posts for your blog,  
and add only pictures from the event, or write a post for your Facebook  
page and add only details from the real event before you publish. You  
must even plan who will make pictures for social media and at what  
intervals they will be uploaded.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
When thinking about live coverage of an event in social media, all  
content should be written during the event. With a good preparationMeeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 339  
before the event, you can have great live coverage. Having time to plan  
in advance always is a good choice and part of your success.  
CASE \#9\: WHEN TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS YOU TO BE  
PERFECT  
Famous speakers attract attention and often allow you to attract more  
people to your event. But in many occasions, the speakers are very busy,  
unable to travel, and their fees are high. Thanks to new technologies,  
you may invite famous speakers to virtually participate in your event  
by using teleconferencing technology. This reduces your expenses and  
gives you the opportunity to have the speaker your audience wants.  
The Challenge  
Broadband connection is often taken for granted, and there is always  
the opportunity to have problems with the quality of the signal. When  
organizing an event with a speaker who will participate via teleconfer-  
ence, it is best to be prepared for the worse possible broadband con-  
nectivity.  
The Opportunity  
Good planning and good preparation are the secret ingredients to a  
successful event. It will take time, but you should record the speech of  
the speaker and have the file ready to be used in case of connectivity  
problems. This gives essential time to your technical staff to work on  
the problem and to be ready for the Q&A session. If done profession-  
ally, it is possible that people in the room will not understand that you  
had problems at all.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Having a backup plan is always the best preparation. As you know from  
Murphy’s Law, “what can go wrong, most likely will go wrong.” The340 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
only way to overcome Murphy’s Law is to be prepared and have con-  
tingency plans in place, such as a pre-recorded version of the speech.  
CASE \#10\: BAD COMMENTS ON A BIG SCREEN  
Using Twitter to place comments on a giant conference screen is now  
a usual practice at many conferences. Most of the guests are eager to  
share their opinions with friends in different networks. Most event  
organizers use this opportunity to show on screen the comments from  
Twitter that are gathered in one place preceded by the hashtag \(\#\) of  
the event.  
The Challenge  
New social media allow every single person to express their individual  
personal views to a wide audience. Unless the comments are moder-  
ated, no one is protected from bad comments.  
The Opportunity  
Before deciding to share all comments on a big screen, think carefully  
and use a person who will react on the comments immediately and will  
be in the position to edit the comments appearing on the big screen.  
That doesn’t mean to delete or remove bad comments, but to be selec-  
tive about which comments to show on the screen, especially to the  
speaker at the moment he or she is presenting on stage.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Moderation is a very important part of keeping online presence fair  
and equitable for your speakers and the audience. Even if you do  
not use one or another social network officially for your conference,  
that doesn’t mean that people there are not talking about you. When  
negative comments are received about your event, you have to react  
by answering, by being polite, and by encouraging your supportersMeeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 341  
to take part in the overall conversation. However, you are not obli-  
gated to show all comments on the big screen in the room while the  
speaker is present.  
CASE \#11\: LIVE NATION SPECIAL EVENTS  
Live Nation Special Events is a series of performances held at unique  
venues across North America. Crowds of thousands attend each live  
event that offers extraordinary programming.  
The Challenge  
Prior to implementing online cloud–based event diagram software,  
Live Nation’s venues found their diagramming abilities challenging as  
the application they use is so difficult to use that some partners/suppli-  
ers chose not to utilize it at all.  
The Opportunity  
In an effort to overcome that challenge, event venues need to find a  
new and easy solution. Many venues are now partnered with online-  
based event diagram design companies. Such adoption can allow venue  
managers to create multiple tailored diagrams with minimal time and  
efforts. Event sales professionals for venues can create professional dia-  
grams and provide effective presentations to prospective buyers while  
saving an immensurable amount of time and spend more time and  
focus on sales efforts.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Event technology is adopted at increasingly fast rate at most event  
management functions, including floor design. Today most event ven-  
ues provide online-based floor diagrams that include detailed specifi-  
cations in 2D \(e.g. dimension, maximum capacity per room setup\) and  
3D \(virtual tour of a venue\).342 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
CASE \#12\: EVENT SALES DURING A CONVENTION  
HOTEL RENOVATION PROJECT  
During construction of a convention hotel, sales staff want to present  
their clients with a detailed view of how the renovations would impact  
the property.  
The Challenge  
This presented the sales/marketing team with a difficult challenge\: How  
could they present what their property would look like once renova-  
tions were completed, in order to show potential customers the prop-  
erty so that pre-opening sales could begin taking place?  
The Opportunity  
The marketing goal is to create a real-life tour that would effectively  
reach potential customers, especially meeting professionals, to show-  
case the newly renovated convention hotel, and ultimately generate  
sales prior to its grand re-opening. The meeting space, hotel amenities,  
and general décor were quite unique; therefore the space needs to be  
carefully illustrated in order to convey these details to meeting pro-  
fessionals. Event diagram software with a feature of 3D rendering can  
depict a highly detailed presentation of what the renovated hotel would  
look like upon when finished.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Many students in the event and convention management field will be  
involved in the sales of venues and services. The key message of this  
case study is to show the application of technology-enhanced venue  
diagrams and virtual tours for improved sales efforts. This case clearly  
represents exactly what the convention hotel would look like when fin-  
ished so that pre-opening sales could take place. Understanding andMeeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 343  
gaining a skill set to apply an event diagram and virtual tour design  
tool can provide extensive background in the hospitality industry to  
effectively depict the experience of a meeting professional from start  
to finish. This skill set can differentiate you from others. More and  
more event venues adopt these programs to successfully bring their  
venue to market before it is actually open for use.  
CASE \#13\: WHEN VM TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS YOU TO  
PLAN COST-EFFECTIVE AND HIGH-IMPACT SPEAKER  
SESSIONS  
A meeting/event planner always wants to invite high-impact speakers  
to their event/meeting. However, most of time there are restrictions,-  
such as limited budget associated with travel costs or scheduling con-  
flicts. Meeting technology, especially various levels of virtual meeting  
technologies, help planners to overcome those challenges to plan a  
high-impact speaker sessions.  
The Challenge  
Famous speakers attract attention and often allow meeting and event  
organizers to attract more people to their event. But in many occasions,  
the famous speakers are very busy, unable to travel, and their fees are  
high. Today’s meeting planners should find an affordable but highly  
effective alternative speaker session. When organizing an event with a  
speaker who will participate via VMT, it is best to be prepared for the  
worse possible broadband connectivity. Broadband connection often  
varies depending on the speaker’s residing country’s technological  
infrastructure, and there is always the opportunity to have problems  
with the quality of the signal.  
The Opportunity  
Thanks to new technologies, meeting and event planners may invite  
famous speakers virtually and let them participate in events by using vir-344 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
tual meeting technology. This can reduce hosting organizers’ expenses  
and allow them to stay within a budget while giving event planners  
an opportunity to have the speaker their audience wants. The speak-  
ers and audience who participate in VMT-embedded session should be  
educated in regard to tips on what to avoid \(e.g. cloth, movement, eye  
contact, pace, etc.\). Good news is that modern VMT is easy to apply  
and requires relatively minimal/manageable technology \(hardware/  
skill set\) than ever along with affordable cost.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Good planning and good preparation are the secret ingredients to a  
successful event. Having a backup plan is always the best preparation.  
Murphy’s Law says “what can go wrong, most likely will go wrong.” It  
may be the best statement that describes meeting/event management.  
The only way to overcome Murphy’s Law \(event problem\) is to be  
prepared and have contingency plans. Students or young meeting/  
event planners should understand that technology-embedded sessions  
can face problems such as connectivity problems. It is ideal to have  
technical staff ready to work on the problem. VMT-embedded sessions  
can be used in meetings and events as it is or as backup plan to live  
speaker sessions. VMT technology provides a recording feature so  
a recorded version of the speech can be viewed later. Further these  
recorded sessions can generate revenue by packaging as a continuing  
education model for those who couldn’t attend the live session.  
CASE \#14\: LIVE EVENT MOBILE ON-SITE ATTENDEE  
ENGAGEMENT  
Event participants are increasingly engaging in second-screen devices  
while watching live events. A meeting/event venue starts with design-  
ing a Wi-Fi system capable of supporting event-day crowds and with  
integrating a second-screen app into the network. This can offer attend-  
ees live commentary, exclusive content, and social sharing features.Meeting and Event Technology\: Case Studies ² 345  
The Challenge  
Large event venues \(e.g. major convention centers, arenas, and stadi-  
ums\) are some of the few remaining “black holes” in regard to Wi-Fi  
connectivity. At the same time, social media has become a key com-  
ponent of attendee engagement during live events at an explosive rate.  
Event attendees are eager for live updates, in-session commentary, and  
the ability to share their event experiences socially. Many event venues  
and organizers are expected to offer a solution to this infrastructure  
challenge and to develop an app to meet attendees’ increasing demands  
for mobile engagement.  
The Opportunity  
Today’s technology offers a solution for infrastructure, called a  
high-density Wi-Fi that can integrated with an event-day app smoothly.  
An event-day app can offer exclusive content and serve as a connecting  
point for attendees, organizers/sponsors, and meeting planners. Tai-  
lored with the attendees in mind, the app allows them to keep up to  
date on programs, follow live sessions, and vote for in-class. The app  
serves as a second-screen partner for each event’s live action and makes  
it easy share content on Twitter and Facebook. To promote the app,  
consider a social media marketing strategy that encourages attendees  
to vote on content using Twitter hashtags.  
How This Case May Be Applied to Advance Your  
Future Career  
Many meeting and event venues are required to provide a high-density  
Wi-Fi system capable of servicing packed venues. It is critical to find  
a provider that is capable of providing reliable connectivity for a large  
crowd. Consider how to develop a mobile solution that is able to capture  
attendee data. An ability to develop an app that is able to deliver quality  
content and enhance event experience is in big demand from the event  
and meeting industry. Reacting to events in real time, you need to346 ² The 21st Century Meeting and Event Technologies  
understand how to keep the content from apps updated in order to  
engage attendees at all points throughout an event and maintain the  
conversation going, even after the event ended.
