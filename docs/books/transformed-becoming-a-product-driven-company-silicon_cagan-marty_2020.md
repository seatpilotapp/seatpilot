“  

TRANSFORMED  
should be in the hands of every organizational  
leader evolving their organization in this post-pandemic world.  
Marty has captured all the impactful aspects of product operating  
model and I can wholeheartedly attest, based on my own personal  
journey in both retail and healthcare, this is a key reference guide  
moving forward.”  
—Prat Vemana, Chief Digital and Product Officer, Target  
“Marty has been helping set the standard in Product for years with  
INSPIRED  
,  
EMPOWERED  
, and his work at SVPG. With  
TRANSFORMED  
, Marty offers a powerful guide to help  
companies master the product concepts, overcome the inevitable  
obstacles of a transformation, and learn from real-world examples  
of product transformations. This book should be a trusted  
resource for any company trying to transition to the product  
model.”  
—Tyler Tuite, Chief Product Officer, Carmax  
“SVPG understands what most executives don't. In order to  
achieve organizational transformation, you must experience a  
personal transformation. This book will show you how to do  
both.”  
—Brendan Wovchko, Chief Technology Officer, Ramsey Solutions “If you have—or are seeking—the courage to transition to a  
product operating model,  
TRANSFORMED  
will be your guiding  
light. This book not only underscores why your organization  
should transform but also provides practical techniques to  
implement the change and drive positive results. Marty's candid  
and straightforward advice on pressing questions, such as how to  
overcome objections from within the organization, is  
indispensable  
and actionable. If you've ever questioned your  
company's ability to innovate—or stay relevant—in an era of  
exponential technological growth,  
TRANSFORMED  
is a must-  
read.”  
—Melissa Cohen, Senior Product Director, Rocket Mortgage  
“If you feel like your organization needs to evolve to the product  
operating model, then  
TRANSFORMED  
is a must-read. In typical  
Marty fashion, he candidly outlines why to do it, how to do it, the  
challenges you'll face \(both the  
who  
and the  
what  
\), and how to  
navigate and overcome them. It's a quick and powerful read and  
one you'll come to revisit over and over.”  
—Shawn Boyer, CEO, GoHappyLabs  
“No one has as much depth and breadth of experience with world-  
class product teams as Marty. In  
TRANSFORMED  
, Marty  
presents a very pragmatic path for otherwise-successful  
companies that still haven't cracked the nut on consistently  
building high-impact software products. This path is not just  
about adopting one magic tactic for goal setting, or rolling out a  
popular software development process. Instead,  
TRANSFORMED  
presents a more holistic approach for organizational design,  
strategy, culture, leadership, and ongoing improvement that  
actually works in the real world.”  
—Shreyas Doshi, Advisor and former product leader at Stripe,  
Twitter, Google, Yahoo “SVPG has already taught us how the product model empowers all  
companies to better serve their customers.  
TRANSFORMED  
now  
teaches us how to unlock that power in any company despite its  
industry, product type or past management approach. With this  
book, we now all have the roadmap needed to transform our  
businesses into product powerhouses.”  
—Michael Newton, CEO, Qorium; former VP Product at Nike  
“  

TRANSFORMED  
is the definitive resource for executives looking  
to gain the ultimate competitive edge in transforming from a  
feature factory to a world-class product organization that delivers  
unrivaled value to customers.”  
—Michelle Longmire, CEO, Medable  
“In an era where technology is the heartbeat of most successful  
businesses,  
TRANSFORMED  
stands out as the essential guide for  
any company navigating the transition to the product operating  
model. Marty masterfully demystifies the journey, blending hard-  
won insights with compelling case studies, making it not only a  
roadmap for transformation but also an inspiration. Having  
witnessed countless organizations grapple with this very shift, I  
can confidently say this book is the beacon they've been waiting  
for. A must-read for anyone serious about harnessing the power of  
technology to propel their business forward.”  
—Mike Fisher, former CTO at Etsy  
“If you're looking to understand the importance of a product-first  
approach to business, this book is a must-read.  
TRANSFORMED  
is an inspirational guide through the product model that speaks  
directly to the non-product executive.”  
—Matt Brown, Chief Financial Officer, Altair Engineering, Inc. “Marty Cagan and the SVPG team have done it again. Through the  
use of great examples, and their signature style of hitting issues  
head-on, they've created a guide to help companies navigate the  
roadblocks and pitfalls that come with transforming to the  
product operating model. This book should be required reading  
for any executive team who wants to make their journey more  
successful.”  
—Anish Bhimani  
,  
Chief Product Officer, Commercial Banking,  
JPMorgan Chase  
“The money, time, and patience you can save by implementing the  
insights in this book is incredible. This was the missing piece in  
Marty's collection that now addresses the common mistakes and  
patterns you encounter while transforming from the rest to the  
best. I hope every board, CEO, and product team reads this.”  
—Anuar Chapur, VP of Technology, The Palace Company  
“  

TRANSFORMED  
is the field guide to embedding innovation into  
organizational DNA. With real-world lessons, provided in easily  
understood narratives, Marty and team bring decades of  
experience to navigating product transformation. A must-read for  
any CEO or CIO who is looking to build a smart, responsive, and  
technologically enabled organization.”  
—Madhu Narasimhan, EVP Innovation, Wells Fargo  
“There are so many ingredients necessary to make a successful  
transformation work. Marty gives you everything you need in  
TRANSFORMED  
. From a valuable perspective for the CEO and  
Board level, to critical technology components like CI/CD, to how  
product can effectively partner across the organization and  
beyond, this is the path to success.”  
—Thomas Fredell, Chief Product Officer, ShiftKey “Building great products that customers love but work for your  
business is  
really, really  
hard. Transforming an organization to  
discover and deliver impactful products consistently is  
even  
harder  
. Meeting Marty in 2019 and reading his book  
Inspired  
started my journey as a product leader, transforming an  
organization from an uninspired feature factory to an empowered  
organization. Christian Idiodi delivering a transformation  
workshop to our entire organization in 2020 accelerated that  
process and led us to exponential growth, thriving through the  
pandemic and then coming out even stronger after the pandemic.  
TRANSFORMED  
powerfully and simply articulates the principles  
and components  
that were critical to successfully transforming  
our business to the product model and then scaling it.”  
—Ronnie Varghese, Chief Digital Officer, Almosafer  
“This is a must-read for any company leader interested in learning  
what it takes to successfully implement and sustain the product  
operating model.  
TRANSFORMED  
not only provides a taxonomy  
that decodes how the best technology companies work, but also  
supplies the reader with specific techniques to drive a true digital  
transformation and showcases real examples from several  
companies across diverse industries. I have no doubt that this  
book will become an essential change management guide to drive  
product transformations across the world!”  
—Juan D. Lopez, Director of Product Management, Blue Origin  
“Every CEO and Chief Product Officer who wants to delight  
customers, increase revenues and profits, and attract and retain  
top talent should read and apply this book—it will transform  
everything.”  
—Phyl Terry, Founder and CEO, Collaborative Gain “  

TRANSFORMED  
is the guide for a successful digital  
transformation. It's comprehensive and practical, giving  
companies the blueprint of what great looks like and how to get  
there. The book is a must-read not only for businesses in the  
midst of transformation, but for any company aspiring to operate  
at its best.”  
—Gabrielle Bufrem, Product Coach  
“Companies spend huge amounts of time and money trying to  
transform, and all too often get little in return.  
TRANSFORMED  
shows what's possible on the other side, what it  
actually  
takes to  
pull it off, and what can derail the effort. I finally have a book  
I  
can give to the people I work with that clearly and practically  
explains the journey we're on.”  
—Andrew Skotzko, Product Leadership Coach & Advisor  
“If your organization aims to innovate like the best tech  
companies, you need to read  
TRANSFORMED  
. I'm buying copies  
for all of my clients.”  
—Felipe Castro, Founder, OutcomeEdge “Ever wondered what sets companies like Stripe, Slack, and Apple  
apart? It's the Product Operating Model, a dynamic conceptual  
framework that transcends traditional processes. In  
TRANSFORMED  
, discover how you, as an executive or product  
leader, can embrace the model's set of first principles, reflecting  
what the best product companies believe to be true about creating  
products. Recognize that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to  
product development. Here, strategic direction is woven into the  
fabric of your organization, with product leaders in tech, design,  
and product providing essential strategic context and dedicating  
themselves to coaching and mentoring their staff. Learn to  
accelerate value delivery and to empower teams to tackle  
problems to solve, rather than features to build. Marty, with 20  
years of transformation expertise, offers a practical guide to instill  
trust, innovation, and adaptability. Your journey taking your  
organization to the next level begins now.”

COVER DESIGN\: PAUL MCCARTHY This book is dedicated to Bruce Williams \(1950–2016\). Bruce was  
the person who gave me the encouragement and confidence to leave  
my comfort zone of leading product for other companies and to go  
out on my own and start the Silicon Valley Product Group \(SVPG\)  
.  
In addition to being an exceptional human who truly helped  
improve the lives of countless people, he was the best friend that  
anyone could ever hope for. Bruce provided me everything from  
office space to expert advice on design, sales, marketing, publishing,  
finance, and more  
.  
Without Bruce, it's likely I would have stayed a product leader and  
not had the opportunity to write any books or to enjoy the  
previously unimaginable quality of life that I've experienced as part  
of SVPG. I thank Bruce for encouraging me to make the single best  
career decision I have ever made  
.  
I wish that everyone could be lucky enough to have a Bruce  
Williams in their lives

# Introduction  
This book has three  
big  
goals\:  
First, we want to  
educate  
you as to exactly what the product  
operating model is and what it means to work in this way.  
Second, we want to  
convince  
you—primarily with detailed case  
studies of successful transformations—that, while such  
transformation is difficult, it is absolutely possible for you to  
transform your company to the product model.  
Third, we want to  
inspire  
you—primarily with several truly  
impressive case studies of product innovation—of what you too will  
be capable of once you successfully transform your organization.  
We start by discussing why we wrote  
TRANSFORMED  
and how it  
relates to the books that led the way to this one\:  
INSPIRED  
and  
EMPOWERED  
.  
Next, we lay out the main reasons that companies are motivated to  
embark on this very significant amount of time and effort to  
transform.  
Then we jump in and describe an all-too-typical transformation  
effort, which usually yields the same all-too-predictable—and  
disappointing—results.  
It's very important that we provide you with a realistic  
understanding of what is involved and required for a successful  
transformation. Many people will try to tell you it's easy—if you  
simply hire them to help. The reality is very different.  
But it's also important that we convince you that it is indeed very  
possible to succeed. And further, we want you to understand what  
you'll be able to do as a company once you have developed these new  
muscles. Finally, we tackle the dilemma of knowing you need to change, but  
not necessarily having leaders who have worked this way before. CHAPTER 1  
# Who Is This Book For?  
TRANSFORMED  
is written for anyone who is trying to help their  
company move to the product operating model.  
That includes\:  
Members of product teams who are trying to move to the  
product model  
Product leaders trying to guide their company through these  
changes  
Senior executives of the company, especially the CEO and CFO,  
who want to learn what is involved in moving to the product  
model, to decide if this is something they wish to pursue, and if  
so, how they can help  
Other company executives, stakeholders, and employees who  
are impacted by the product model, and want to learn how to  
constructively engage  
Product coaches who are trying to help companies successfully  
transform to the product model  
One very common question is\: “We're not a tech company, so is the  
product model even relevant for us?”  
This is a very widespread confusion. When our industry refers to a  
“tech company,” the term is  
not  
referring to what the company  
sells  
,  
it is referring to how the company believes it should  
power its  
business  
.  
Tesla sells cars. Netflix sells entertainment. Google sells advertising.  
Airbnb sells vacation lodging. Amazon started with selling books and  
now sells just about everything.  
The difference is not  
what  
these companies sell; it's  
how  
they design  
and build what they sell, and how they run their business. The product operating model is for companies that believe they  
should be powering their business with technology. Today, that's a  
very wide range of businesses across virtually every industry.  
How does this book relate to  
INSPIRED  
and  
EMPOWERED  
?  
We wrote  
INSPIRED  
to share the best practices and techniques used  
by the top product teams operating in the product model.  
Then we wrote  
EMPOWERED  
to share the best practices and  
techniques used by the top product leaders to provide their product  
teams with the environment they need to thrive in the product  
model.  
Yet, by far the most common question we get is\: “Our company  
operates so differently from what you describe. Is it even possible for  
a company like ours to change to the product model, and how would  
we change?”  
The goal of this book is to answer that question.  
For the past 20 years, we at SVPG have been helping companies  
through these changes.  
What we've learned is that there are some companies—mostly newer  
companies that were created in the internet era—born out of this new  
model of technology-powered product companies. For them, this way  
of working is quite natural.  
However, for the vast majority of companies in the world, the ways of  
working we describe are very foreign.  
One CEO described the experience of transforming as “changing  
from driving on the right side of the road to the left—but gradually.”  
These companies know they need to transform to compete in an era  
of rapidly changing enabling technology, but they have found that  
the degree of change necessary is substantial, and anything but easy.  
If you've read  
INSPIRED  
or  
EMPOWERED  
, then you'll recognize  
the components of the product model, but those books don't address  
how to make the necessary changes to how you work.  
If you have not read our other books, this book was written to  
provide the necessary understanding of the concepts of the product model and give you the foundation you need. CHAPTER 2  
# What Is a Product Operating Model?  
Unfortunately, the tech industry is not great when it comes to  
standardization of terms. We often have different terms for the same  
concept and, in some cases, different definitions of the same term.  
We don't like introducing new nomenclature, but we do need to be  
clear on what we mean when we talk about important concepts in  
this book.  
The most fundamental concept we use and need to be clear on is the  
general  
product operating model  
.  
We did not invent the term—we've found it in use in several strong  
product companies, and several more use the shortened form  
product model  
.  
The product operating model is not a process, or even a single way of  
working. It is a  
conceptual model  
based on a set of first principles  
that strong product companies believe to be true. Principles such as  
the necessary role of experimentation, or prioritizing innovation over  
predictability.  
We're using the term in this book to refer to the way of operating that  
we find the best product companies consistently use.  
Essentially, the product operating model is about consistently  
creating technology-powered solutions that your customers love, yet  
work for your business.  
From the financial perspective, it's about getting the most out of your  
technology investment.  
It's important to emphasize that there is  
no single right way to  
build products.  
There will be more on this critical point later. But  
for now, know that there are many good ways, much as there are an  
even larger number of bad ways.  
It's also a good time to point out something we emphasize in each of  
our books\:  
Nothing you will read in this book was invented by us  
.  
We simply write about what we observe in the best product  
companies. That said, we don't write about everything we see; we  
focus on what we believe are the common themes and first  
principles. We are effectively playing the roles of  
curator  
and  
evangelist  
.  
The product operating model is sometimes referred to as  
product-led  
company  
or  
product-centric company  
. We don't like those terms  
because they often have the unfortunate side effect of implying that  
the product organization is taking over.  
Similarly, while the product operating model is an example of a  
customer-driven company  
, that term has been misused to the point  
that it has lost its utility.  
A tougher concept to name is the model you might be coming  
from  
.  
The main influence on how the company thinks of its previous model  
is generally this\: Who is really in the driver's seat?  
In many companies, you'll hear constant references to “the business”  
in terms of making requests, and they're running what is commonly  
referred to as the  
IT model  
\(as in “IT is there to serve the business”\).  
A close cousin of the IT model is the  
project model  
, where the CFO  
plays an outsize role because funding and staffing are typically  
project based.  
If general stakeholders are in the driver's seat, then it's often called  
the  
feature-team model  
\(because each stakeholder drives their  
roadmap of features\).  
If sales is driving, then you'll often hear the term  
sales-driven  
product  
, and if marketing is driving, you'll hear  
marketing-driven  
product  
.  
Throughout this book, we refer to whatever model you are coming  
from  
as your  
prior model  
, and we refer to the model you're working  
to transform  
to  
as the  
product operating model  
, or simply the  
shortened term  
product model  
.  
In  
part III  
of this book,  
Transformation Defined,  
you'll see a  
detailed definition of what it means to work in the product operating  
model. There are several other important product terms and concepts that  
we discuss in this book, and we will define those as we go.  
What Is a Product?  
This seemingly simple question comes up very frequently, but  
there are several layers to this question, and there are different  
reasons that people ask the question.  
Sometimes the person is concerned they are not working on  
something that is customer-facing, such as an e-commerce app or  
a consumer device. Maybe they are working on an internal tool,  
used by employees at their company to take care of the company's  
paying customers. Or maybe they're working on a platform  
service that is used to build other types of products. Or maybe a  
back-office–style system that provides critical data. Or maybe the  
person is building a device and not purely software. We have  
different terms for these types of products, but rest assured, these  
are all products that the product model is designed to help with.  
Sometimes the question is whether what you're working on  
constitutes a  
complete  
product, or if it's just a small piece of  
something much larger. This is getting at the important topic of  
something we call  
team topology  
, but for our purposes, these are  
all considered products as well, even if just a small part of a larger  
whole.  
And sometimes people are asking the question because they are  
not actually building anything. Plenty of types of products are not  
technology-powered products built by engineers. Perhaps the  
person manages a relationship with a third-party vendor, and  
they are wondering if the product model applies to them as well.  
In this case, no. The product model is meant to address the  
unique challenges of those who are  
building  
technology-powered  
products and services. CHAPTER 3  
# Why Transform?  
By making the decision to read this book, odds are you already have  
your reasons for embarking on a transformation.  
But with the stakes so high, and the effort required so substantial, it's  
helpful to have a clear articulation of your purpose.  
Generally speaking, we find companies are motivated by one or more  
of three major drivers\:  
# A Competitive Threat  
Few industries remaining have not already been attacked by new  
competitors providing demonstrably better solutions for customers.  
As of this writing, the latest disruptive technology, Generative AI, is  
already reshaping the competitive landscape for many industries. As  
is always the case, some companies are leveraging this new  
technology to solve long-standing problems for their customers in  
ways that are just now possible, and other companies are being left  
behind.  
This process of disruptive innovation has taken place in industries as  
varied as financial services, health care, retail, automotive, logistics,  
advertising, and even space exploration.  
Certain industries have higher switching costs, more significant  
regulatory hurdles, or a degree of government protection, so this  
disruption has taken longer, but few companies feel truly secure.  
These companies realize they are competing in a battle for customers  
with weapons and strategies that once worked but that today cannot  
match the tools and capabilities of their new adversaries.  
A Compelling Prize Other companies are motivated by the financial rewards available to  
those companies that have demonstrated the ability to consistently  
innovate on behalf of their customers.  
They see the valuations of the new generation of companies, as well  
as the rewards to those that have successfully transformed, and the  
promise of this prize motivates investors, executives, product  
leaders, and employees to pursue this path.  
# Frustrated Leaders  
Some companies pursue the product model because they have grown  
frustrated at the level of funding they've been pouring into their  
technology efforts, with so little in return.  
The constant cost overruns, the disappointing results, the time it  
takes to ship anything, customers who are losing patience, and the  
endless stream of blaming and excuses.  
Perhaps the leaders have read about companies that spend less yet  
generate much more, and they wish to learn if these methods might  
apply to them.  
In some cases, one or more additional factors conspire to push a  
company to the point where its leaders feel they must take the leap to  
transform\:  
Perhaps you find your most capable technology employees  
leaving your company out of frustration with the current way of  
operating.  
Perhaps your company has hired a leader who comes from a  
strong product company and has been encouraging others to  
consider this approach.  
Perhaps your customers' expectations have changed, and while  
they wish to remain loyal, they are increasingly vocal about their  
frustrations with your offerings and your pace of improvement.  
Whatever the motivations, fundamentally, companies transform  
because  
they believe they need to be able to successfully take advantage of new opportunities that arise and effectively respond  
to serious threats  
. CHAPTER 4  
# A Typical Transformation  
Most companies that we've engaged with on a transformation have  
already tried to transform—at least once—before they realized  
they've spent a lot of time and money going nowhere.  
The story that follows is all too common. We've removed the names,  
but the circumstances are very real. See how much of their story you  
recognize.  
This company had dominated the financial operations market since  
its inception in 2000. It had always had a strong customer focus,  
priding itself on being able to deliver exactly what the customer  
requested, which ended up driving a long series of “specials” to meet  
the perceived needs of different individual customers.  
Initially, this focus on doing whatever was necessary to close the deal  
achieved some real business success. Internally and externally,  
delivering quickly on client needs became a key brand strength.  
That is, until it wasn't.  
Despite increasing headcount and a culture of long working hours,  
the time to deliver new capabilities had noticeably slowed. At the  
same time, there were several new entrants to the market. Each had  
moved  
fast to gain traction. The result was that sales had started to  
lag, and market share was dropping.  
In response, the company pursued a strategy of aggressive  
acquisition, moving quickly to purchase and integrate additional  
solutions. But far from igniting a new era of profitability, the  
acquisitions proved problematic and were not generating the hoped-  
for revenue.  
# A New Start  
The board reacted, taking action to make changes at the very top. The company's incoming CEO arrived with an impressive  
commercial track record. After quickly making her  
1  

way through the  
ranks of a global consultancy to become its youngest senior partner,  
she then assumed a variety of C-level roles across numerous  
commercial finance organizations.  
As a first-time CEO, she understood that her career would be defined  
by her results. This was no time to fail, and she had done her  
homework. The company still had strong market share, a recognized  
brand name, and was profitable. But she knew change was required  
—she had pitched as much to the board. Her appointment was based  
on a mandate to reinvigorate the brand.  
The playbook was well rehearsed, one she had practiced across  
multiple different sectors in her years as a management consultant.  
She quickly got to work diagnosing the problems.  
The company had become a sprawling organization, with offices  
across the globe, including in the US, India, and Europe. The  
resulting cultural differences ran deep.  
After years of acquisition-led growth, the company was essentially  
several companies, with little integration, heavy technical debt, and  
frustrated customers.  
The new CEO's previous relationships allowed her to quickly employ  
the advice of consultancy services, which helped to rapidly diagnose  
some key legacy practices.  
The changes would need to be significant. They included a new,  
centralized organizational structure, the insourcing of engineering, a  
more focused business mission, and the creation of a new product  
unit housing product managers and designers. A new chief digital  
officer \(CDO\) was hired to lead the transformation effort.  
# Friction and Pushback  
Numerous challenges were taken on in parallel, not least the  
insourcing of engineering. Hiring a team of 600 engineers in tough  
market conditions meant high salaries, and 12 months in, the  
company had exceeded the budget but was still short of its required  
numbers. To keep costs down, rather than hire skilled product managers, the company opted to retitle a team of business analysts.  
The rationalization was that the product suite was complex and  
required deep domain experience.  
Change was proving to be more disruptive and costly than the  
company had originally anticipated. Sales, long regarded as the sole  
owner of customer success, was not happy with the changes and  
complained directly to the CEO. While the new CDO reported  
positively on new engineering hires and the creation of multiple  
product teams, things were moving slowly, and costs continued to  
increase.  
Away from the ears of the executives, the incoming engineers gasped  
at the levels of technical debt. Each one of the acquired businesses  
had continued to operate on its legacy technical stack. There had  
been no serious attempt to integrate their solutions. Many of the  
original people were gone. Those who were left could barely keep  
many of those systems running. The engineers saw no real  
alternative to immediate replatforming.  
Privately, leadership was sympathetic to the new engineers, but there  
was little appetite to take on yet another significant effort, this  
time  
for replatforming. They were encouraged to refactor where they  
could but to try to find a way to accelerate the roadmap delivery.  
After two years of transformation, things were moving slower than  
ever. The CEO decided that the core issue was with engineering, and  
they needed help to deliver predictable and reliable results.  
# Focus on Predictability  
The CIO recommended a switch to a new, more formal and  
structured engineering delivery process, and teams were retrained on  
this process in hopes of increasing predictability, albeit with longer,  
less frequent release cycles.  
But with even fewer releases, the new battleground was which  
business unit could shoehorn in sufficient amounts of features to  
satisfy the pain—and cost—of customer upgrades. There was also  
significant new process overhead. With all eyes on each and every lengthy release, a team of program  
managers was hired to oversee the delivery process by adding a layer  
of governance and control.  
As costs continued to increase, releases became few and far between.  
Meanwhile, competitors were thriving. The board's initial  
expectations of success were now all but forgotten.  
Additionally, a key number of the recently hired engineers had  
resigned, citing a failure of leadership. Customer retention was  
proving increasingly difficult, with many frustrated by the all-too-  
obvious lack of progress.  
Believing they had nothing to lose, a small number of product and  
engineering leaders chose to speak directly to the CEO.  
Their technology, they argued, was preventing the company from  
meeting the needs of customers, and the level of bureaucracy was  
now so high that they felt no ability to make any forward progress.  
None of the options was good. The technology mismanagement of  
the past had finally caught up with the company.  
With tens of millions of dollars in transformational costs spent, the  
CEO wondered what the company had to show for it. After four  
years  
of pain and expense, and with the combined frustration of her fellow  
executives bearing down on her, the CEO was informed she no  
longer had the support of the board.  
The company's transformation had, gradually, then all at once,  
failed.  
# Note  
1  
Aligned with our long-standing interest in expanding the  
perception of who a strong leader is, we use she/her pronouns  
throughout this book. That being said, this book is intended for  
anyone  
of  
any  
gender identity. Our view is that if you are a good  
person who cares about the craft of product, we hope to have you  
as a friend. CHAPTER 5  
# The Role of the CEO  
Probably the most important lesson we have learned in 20 years of  
helping companies with transformations to the product model is the  
absolutely critical role that the CEO needs to play in order for the  
transformation to succeed.  
Please don't misunderstand. The CEO does not need to have prior  
experience with the product model. And the CEO doesn't have to  
spend a lot of time on the transformation itself.  
But, nevertheless, the CEO role is critical.  
Now, every CEO will of course say she supports the transformation.  
Yet most don't truly realize what this means until much later in the  
effort.  
Here is the problem\: Transformation impacts the company far  
beyond what was previously your technology department.  
The issue is that transformation impacts sales, marketing, finance,  
HR, legal, business development, compliance, and manufacturing.  
In this book, we discuss precisely how and why transformation  
impacts each of these areas. But the important point here is that not  
every key leader and stakeholder will be enthusiastic about moving  
to this new way of working.  
Most will be motivated to at least try out an approach that holds the  
potential for better results. And many of these people realize that  
learning to work effectively in the product model is increasingly an  
asset to any resume.  
It's also important to realize that even the most enthusiastic  
stakeholder or executive may have questions or very legitimate  
objections that they want to make sure are addressed.  
But some will passively resist, and likely a few will actively resist.  
Either because they are protecting their current responsibilities, or because of the age-old preference for the devil you know versus the  
devil you don't.  
These problematic stakeholders all eventually report up to the CEO,  
and that's whom they will look to decide if this is truly important and  
necessary.  
As the legendary coach Bill Campbell used to say\: “The company  
cares about what the leader cares about.”  
Too often, the CEO delegates ownership of the transformation to a  
CIO, a chief digital officer, or a chief transformation officer. And  
while these individuals can influence decisions and actions  
within  
their organization, unless the stakeholders report to them \(which is  
rarely the case\), this same problem will result.  
If you're a CEO, this may be the first time you're learning that  
transformation is something that goes beyond IT. If that's the case,  
it's critical that you consider this new information.  
It's true that most companies begin their transformation efforts by  
focusing on the necessary changes to product, design, and  
engineering. And that's appropriate because until and unless those  
capabilities are established, the rest is premature.  
There are new competencies you'll need to develop, new skills and  
new principles to instill in your organization, and, most important, a  
cultural change that needs to take place.  
However, too often it is only after those changes are made that the  
company realizes that taking advantage of these new capabilities  
impacts the  
entire  
company. And when the CEO and the other senior  
leaders are not actively supportive of these changes, the  
transformation effort stalls out.  
To be explicit\:  
The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist  
for the product model  
.  
If this is something your CEO is unwilling or unable to do, then you  
can likely save yourself a lot of time, money, and effort by reassessing  
your readiness.  
However, the good news is that a company operating successfully  
under the product model improves the situation for everyone, not just the product and engineering organization.  
Employees feel more pride in the company's products. Marketing has  
more to promote and position. Sales can sell more. Everyone sees the  
financial impact. Employee morale and retention improve.  
Which is all to say that there's a strong case to be made to justify the  
active help and support of the CEO. CHAPTER 6  
# A Guide to  
# TRANSFORMED  
We hope that by now you are starting to develop an appreciation for  
what we mean when we say that transformation is hard.  
This book is intended to prepare you for what lies ahead.  
One thing you  
won't  
find in this book is any sort of recipe or  
playbook for transformation. Many people out there will try to sell  
you such a thing, but unfortunately, we have never seen these one-  
size-fits-all, overly simplified approaches work.  
Interspersed throughout the book are  
Transformation Stories  
—  
case studies of successful transformations—as well as  
Innovation  
Stories  
—case studies of innovative solutions created by companies  
that have previously transformed.  
The transformation case studies are meant to give you confidence  
that, although difficult,  
success is absolutely possible  
. These stories  
are shared with you by the person who was leading the product  
organization at each of these companies.  
The innovation case studies are intended to get you excited about  
what you'll be able to do once you've transformed.  
Beyond the case studies, the book is organized into the following  
parts\:  
We start things off in  
part II  
,  
Transformation Defined  
, with a  
comprehensive definition of what is truly meant by transformation to  
the product operating model.  
The next two parts get to the heart of the new skills and capabilities  
you'll need to develop to move to the product model.  
In  
part III  
, we begin by discussing the new  
Product Model  
Competencies  
you will need to develop in order to transform. If  
you think you already have these competencies in your company, you  
are almost certainly wrong and headed for transformation failure.  
Don't be fooled by people who have simply adopted these titles. Next, in  
part IV  
, we present the  
Product Model Concepts  
—and  
the product model principles they are based on—that are the  
foundation of the product model. Most companies very quickly  
realize that they don't yet have these skills, which is the first step to  
learning them.  
The new product model competencies and the product model  
concepts are the foundation upon which transformation rests  
.  
In  
part VI  
,  
The Product Model in Action  
, we discuss how the  
product organization constructively and effectively partners with  
customers, sales, product marketing, finance, stakeholders, and the  
senior executives.  
Next, in  
part VIII  
, we discuss the  
Transformation Techniques  
that are helpful in guiding your organization through a change of this  
magnitude. Change is always difficult, but there are several key  
techniques and tactics designed to facilitate transformation. We  
begin with an organization assessment, then we describe a variety of  
tactics. We also describe the importance of ongoing transformation  
evangelism.  
You may already realize there's a bit of a catch-22 going on here.  
How does a company that has never worked in a new way, and may  
not have any leaders who have worked that way, learn this new way  
of working?  
Books and various types of training can help \(if the authors and  
trainers know what they're talking about\), but they are rarely  
sufficient. We explore how you can move to the new model when  
your leaders have never worked this way before.  
Next, in  
part X  
,  
Overcoming Objections  
, we discuss the various  
concerns that commonly arise from each key stakeholder—sales,  
marketing, customer success, finance, HR, the CIO, the PMO, the  
CEO, and the board—and also the objections that come from inside  
the product organization.  
These are all legitimate objections and concerns, and people typically  
raise them in good faith, simply because they can see an issue and  
they don't yet know how that issue will be addressed. We consider  
each of these objections and then discuss how to overcome them. In  
part XI  
,  
Conclusion  
, we try to connect the dots and summarize  
the critical points discussed in the book, including the common  
themes from the transformation case studies and the keys to success. Tough Love for Product Leaders  
Successful transformation is hard to pull off, and it requires  
tackling tough issues where often the people involved really don't  
want to hear it.  
So, in that spirit, we'll start with a bit of that tough love right now,  
intended for the product leaders\:  
1  
There is no question that the executives of the company have a  
major role to play in helping the company transform.  
However, the surprise for so many product leaders is that they  
have  
at least  
as much work to do.  
It is truly perplexing how many product leaders believe that once  
the senior executives change their ways, all will be good. They  
focus their energy on getting others to change, rather than on  
changing themselves.  
They complain about having weak product managers.  
They complain about not being empowered.  
They complain about engineers who don't seem engaged.  
They complain about having stakeholders that don't trust them.  
They complain about CEOs who demand detailed product  
roadmaps.  
Yet, they don't seem to realize that each of these problems is very  
much a consequence of their own actions \(or inactions, as the  
case may be\).  
If a product leader is not willing to take responsibility for raising  
the skill level of her product people, or to correct hiring mistakes,  
then the product teams will be staffed with people who lack the  
necessary level of competence.  
When that's the case, who would be surprised if the teams are not  
empowered?  
Who would be surprised if the engineers act like mercenaries? Who would be surprised if the stakeholders don't trust the  
product managers?  
Who would be surprised if the CEO doesn't trust the people  
responsible for those weak product people?  
More generally, there are two important things for you as product  
leader to keep in mind as you embark on a transformation\: First,  
you have as much ownership as you have credibility; and second,  
part of your job as a product leader is to change hearts and  
minds.  
While it is true that the executives have much to change to move  
to the product model, even larger changes are required of the  
product leaders and product teams.  
Our intention is to make very clear the changes that are needed  
from  
all  
sides, but success starts with the product organization  
raising its game.  
# Note  
1  
Just to be very clear on our use of terms\: Product managers,  
product designers, tech leads, and the other engineers, data  
scientists, and user researchers are all  
individual contributors  
.  
The term “product leaders” refers to the  
managers  
of product  
management, product design, and engineering. The term  
“executives” refers to the company's  
senior leaders  
—the CEO,  
CFO, COO, CMO, CRO, and so on. PART II  
# Transformation Defined  
There are so many anti-patterns when it comes to transformation.  
Many of us have witnessed failed transformations, but few have  
witnessed true successes. Which makes the lessons learned from  
successful transformations unusually valuable.  
One question we get quite frequently is\: “What can our company do  
after transformation that we couldn't do before?”  
Since we in the product world talk a great deal about outcomes and  
results, we think that's the right question.  
And this book emphasizes the capabilities and results of those  
companies that have transformed, especially their ability to respond  
to threats and take advantage of new opportunities.  
But assuming the leaders of a company believe they need to truly  
transform,  
what does that really mean?  
Many of you have heard things like “Transforming to Agile may be  
necessary, but it's in no way sufficient.”  
Or, “The heart of transformation is moving from feature teams to  
empowered product teams.”  
Or, “The goal is to transform to a product-led company.”  
While each of these comments may speak to a specific aspect of  
transformation, none gives a good, holistic picture of what is truly  
meant by  
transformation  
.  
So, in this book, we take a different approach.  
Instead of applying a label \(“Agile,” “Empowered Teams,” “Product-  
Led Company”\), we think it's more useful to look at what is actually  
changing.  
In this book, we discuss the product model as change along three  
distinct dimensions\: 1\. Changing how you build  
2\. Changing how you solve problems  
3\. Changing how you decide which problems to solve  
# Changing How You Build  
Despite Agile being around for so many years, far too many  
companies still are stuck doing monthly or quarterly \(or worse\) big-  
bang releases.  
The rise of so-called  
fake Agile  
1  

lets these companies fool themselves  
into thinking they're working the way they need to without actually  
improving  
how  
they build in any meaningful way.  
Our company and our customers need us to provide a reliable service  
that they can depend on.  
This means frequent, small releases. It means instrumenting your  
technology so that you know that it's working and how it's being  
used. It means monitoring your technology so that you can,  
hopefully, detect any problems before your customers do. And it  
means being able to prove that new capabilities deliver the necessary  
value before you deploy widely.  
If you're not doing continuous delivery, then at the very least you  
need to be doing true releases  
2  

no less frequently than every two  
weeks.  
# Changing How You Solve Problems  
When a company talks about transforming from feature teams to  
empowered product teams, they mainly mean changing how they  
solve problems.  
Instead of stakeholders prioritizing their perceived solutions  
\(features and projects\) and providing these in the form of a roadmap  
to a feature team, now the product team is assigned problems to  
solve, and the product team is empowered to discover a solution that  
is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable. The point is to push the decisions on the best solution down to the  
people closest to the enabling technology and to the users interacting  
with this technology.  
In practice, this means developing the skills to rapidly test product  
ideas to discover a solution worth building \(this is called  
product  
discovery  
\) and ensuring that your engineers and product designers  
have a true product manager \(skilled in the customers, the data, the  
business, and the industry\) so that the product team has the  
necessary cross-functional skills to succeed.  
It's important to note that this change implies a new relationship  
with the company stakeholders—where the product team moves  
from a subservient relationship to a collaborative relationship, and  
where the product team must discover a solution that customers love  
yet works for the business.  
# Changing How You Decide Which Problems to  
# Solve  
Getting skilled at product discovery so that your teams can  
consistently and quickly solve hard problems in ways that your  
customers love, yet work for your business, is a significant leap  
forward by anyone's definition. But it doesn't address the question\:  
“How did you decide this was the most important problem to be  
solved?”  
In prior models, stakeholders usually decide which problems get  
solved. In the product model, a new and critical competency is the  
job of product leadership.  
Every company faces several threats, and many opportunities. Which  
threats you take seriously, and which opportunities you decide to  
pursue, can mean the difference between success and failure.  
A strong product company has a compelling product vision and an  
insight-based product strategy to identify the most critical problems  
that need to be solved to deliver on the business objectives.  
A couple of important notes\: First, all three of these dimensions—changing how you build, how  
you solve problems, and how you decide on which problems to solve  
—depend on strong product leaders \(leaders of product  
management, product design, and engineering\), and we hope you  
can start to get a sense of why product leadership is so hard. The  
people on the product teams will require coaching and strategic  
context.  
Second, at a high level, you can treat each of these three dimensions  
as steps in a progression, and indeed this would be one way to  
approach a company transformation. But, in reality, each of these  
three dimensions is a spectrum, and you can and should make  
progress on different dimensions in parallel. Much more on this in  
part VIII  
,  
Transformation Techniques  
.  
To summarize\:  
Changing how you build and deploy means moving from big,  
quarterly releases to a cadence of small, consistent, frequent  
releases. This is key to consistently improving time to market.  
Changing how you solve problems means moving from  
stakeholder-driven roadmaps and feature teams to empowered  
product teams given problems to solve, and then using product  
discovery to come up with solutions that are valuable, usable,  
feasible, and viable. Doing this means solving both for the  
customer and for your business. This change is key to  
consistently improving time to money.  
Changing how you decide which problems to solve is typically  
the most profound change of all, as it drives what opportunities  
you choose to pursue and how you make the most out of your  
investment, including product vision and product strategy. This  
change is key to maximizing the return on your technology  
investment.  
Hopefully this framing can help you think more holistically about the  
transformation that your company may need to make, and where you  
may be on that journey.  
In the next three chapters, we drill into each of these three  
dimensions and describe  
why  
these changes are so important to strong product companies.  
While these concepts may be somewhat technical, a deep  
understanding of technology is not required to understand the  
importance—and the value—to your business and your customers.  
# Notes  
1  
2  
The most egregious example of what is known as “fake Agile” is  
SAFe, but even teams using basic Scrum yet releasing only  
monthly or quarterly are missing out on the actual benefits of  
Agile.  
The meaning of a  
true release  
varies in different types of  
products, but for our purposes, it means getting to the state where  
you can successfully deliver new capabilities into the hands of  
your customers. CHAPTER 7  
# Changing How You Build  
Your technology investment is all about creating value for your  
customers and your company.  
There are several important aspects to creating this value, but at the  
end of the day, the primary skill you depend on to build your  
products is your engineers.  
For many technology-powered companies, the engineers are the  
single largest line-item cost.  
In most of the prior models, typically each technology effort is  
treated as a project.  
Each project is funded, staffed, planned, executed, and delivered.  
The project ends upon delivery, and people roll off to other work.  
Realize that everything we build has two outputs that could create  
value\: what we make and what we learn. In the project model, we  
lose most of what we learn.  
If and when we want to work on that area again, we spend time and  
money relearning things we already paid for once. Or, more likely,  
not learning them, and making costly mistakes.  
Further, teams that have to live in the code they build treat it  
differently than teams that know they are rolling off at the end of the  
project. This is why technical debt is so rampant in the project  
model.  
It's similar to the difference between remodeling a house to sell it  
versus to live in it. In the former case, just painting over the  
wallpaper is faster and cheaper, and who cares if the paint peels  
later?  
It's not a coincidence that this is the way outsourcing is done, and we  
often say if this is how you want to work, then you may as well hire  
Accenture because that company is better at working this way than  
you are ever likely to be. But in the product model, this way of working is far too expensive in  
terms of time and money, and, more important, it almost never  
delivers the innovation your customers and your company need.  
So, this is why transformation starts with changing  
how  
you build.  
And this means changing the focus from  
projects  
to  
products  
.  
In the product model, products are instead managed as ongoing  
efforts—improving every week \(in strong product companies, many  
times a day\), typically for several years.  
You may change the work of the teams from adding new capabilities  
to generating additional revenue, or reducing operating costs, or  
doing whatever the company needs. But, in general, the team  
continues to invest in the products until either the company decides  
to stop investing and just sustain the current revenue, or the decision  
is made to sunset the product from its offering altogether.  
In this model of continuous development, you need small, frequent,  
reliable release vehicles.  
Strong product companies learned many years ago that while this  
may sound counterintuitive, the data very clearly show that the more  
you build, and the more changes you are delivering, it is much better  
for you—and especially for your customers—to release more  
frequently rather than less frequently.  
1  
If you genuinely care about providing a reliable service for your  
customers, it is much easier to ensure that a small number of  
changes  
are working properly and don't introduce any inadvertent  
problems than it is to group a large number of changes together and  
try to deliver all at once \(referred to in the industry as a  
big-bang  
release\).  
Just to make this important point very clear, if each of your product  
teams is not releasing at least once every two weeks, then you will  
not be able to take care of your customers as you need to.  
2  
Moreover, for everything you deploy, you need to ensure that the  
new capabilities are instrumented so that you know the product is  
operating properly and so you understand how your customers are  
actually using your product. You also need to be continuously  
monitoring your product to detect any issues, hopefully before your customers do. For many important changes, you need to be able to  
prove that the new capability is providing the necessary value before  
you deploy broadly \(the standard way of doing this is with an A/B  
test\).  
You may think that this doesn't apply to your type of product, or you  
may point out that your customers are pushing you for  
less frequent  
releases, not more frequent releases, but in  
chapter 18  
, “Product  
Delivery,” we discuss the reasons why this is critical for both you and  
your customers, the principles that drive this way of working, and the  
mechanisms used to do this. A Note About Agile and Agile Coaches  
You have almost certainly heard of Agile. A main reason so many  
companies moved to Agile processes over the past 20 years is that  
these methods were intended to provide the forcing function to  
get product teams to achieve these consistent, small, frequent  
releases.  
It's true that moving to small, frequent releases can require a  
significant investment—mainly in testing and deployment  
automation. But for those companies that employed Agile  
methods to get them to release  
no less frequently than every  
other week  
, it has provided them and their customers real value.  
That said, it's important to understand that you don't need Agile  
methods to have consistent, small, frequent releases.  
In fact, many of the best product teams in the world have  
mastered the ability to consistently deploy very small releases  
\(referred to as  
continuous integration and continuous  
deployment, or CI/CD  
\), yet they don't follow any formal Agile  
process or methods.  
Contrast this with organizations that invest so much time and  
money in adopting Agile coaches, rituals, roles, methods, and  
processes yet, at the end of that considerable expense and time,  
are still releasing quarterly and inflicting the associated pain on  
their customers.  
And just to be perfectly clear on this very critical point\: If your  
company is still releasing yearly, quarterly, or even monthly, it  
doesn't matter how many Agile rituals you follow or how many  
so-called Agile coaches you may employ. The truth is that you are  
not  
Agile \(or even lowercase agile\) in any meaningful sense, you  
are not getting the benefits, and you will not be able to serve your  
customers or your business as you need to.  
Many companies spent many millions of dollars moving to Agile  
processes because they thought this is what it meant to  
transform, yet they have few if any meaningful results to show for  
the effort. If this is you, we're sure you are beyond frustrated. But the truth is that whether or not you choose to fly an Agile  
flag, you need to get each of your product teams to the point  
where they can deliver frequent, small, reliable releases no less  
than once every two weeks.  
If your current people can't do that, you will need to bring in  
either experienced engineering leaders or engineers or a true  
product delivery coach to show them how.

# Changing How You Solve Problems  
Changing how you build, test, and deploy is important no matter  
what you choose to build, but too many companies just become more  
efficient feature factories.  
They ship more new features than ever, yet they don't see the  
corresponding value to their customers, or the impact to their  
business.  
In fact, in most companies today, the percentage of features and  
projects on product roadmaps that actually generate a positive return  
on investment is depressingly small. Most industry analysts place it  
in the range of 10 to 30 percent.  
If you compare the list of capabilities that your company needs with  
the impact that your newly released capabilities are generating, and  
if you are not feeling good about the return, then this is why  
changing how you solve problems is so important.  
The root of the issue is that these feature teams are set up to  
serve  
the stakeholders  
in your business, rather than to  
serve your  
customers in ways that work for your business  
.  
The business leaders and other stakeholders each understand their  
specific operational needs, and they come up with a list of features  
and projects that they believe will help them deliver on their  
obligations to the business. They hand these priorities down to the  
feature teams, which are then asked to provide a product roadmap  
with dates and deliverables.  
So, why do so few of these features actually generate the hoped-for  
return?  
Realize that each of these features is a  
potential solution  
to some  
underlying problem. It might be a customer problem—maybe  
customers can't figure out how to use your product effectively. Or it might be a company problem—maybe it costs too much for you to  
provision your product.  
In the feature team model, the feature on the roadmap is designed by  
the designer on the feature team and then built by the engineers on  
the feature team. But whether that feature will provide any value to  
your customers or your company is the responsibility of whoever  
requested that feature on the roadmap.  
This is usually a stakeholder, who may understand their own needs  
but doesn't have the intimate understanding of the enabling  
technology so critical to tech-powered products, and rarely has the  
benefit of the latest conversations with users and customers  
concerning their needs and issues.  
As a result, in the feature team model, you can't hold the feature  
team accountable for business results. The team is there only to  
produce  
output  
—the  
features  
. If a feature doesn't generate the  
desired  
outcome  
, the team will simply point out the fact that they  
just built what they were told to.  
Now, it's also very true that the stakeholder who decided on this  
feature will not want to take responsibility for the failure, either.  
They'll almost certainly argue that the feature that was shipped was  
not what they had hoped it would be or that it took longer to deliver  
than they had expected. Which is why lack of trust between  
stakeholders and feature teams is such a common complaint.  
Another serious consequence of this way of working is that you end  
up with a great many “orphaned” features—features that don't  
produce real value but are waiting for the day they might get another  
iteration, which rarely happens. The result is a very fast  
accumulation of technical debt, which can quickly get out of hand  
and end up dramatically slowing down the teams. At its worst, it can  
bring the business to its knees.  
For whatever reason, as soon as you lose your ability to consistently  
create value—to innovate on behalf of your customers—it is only a  
matter of time until your competitors are able to offer a more  
compelling solution to your customers. This has happened to  
countless companies. You can reduce your prices, and you can run clever marketing and  
sales promotions, but these measures at best just delay the  
inevitable. Eventually, someone else will serve your customers in  
ways that you no longer can.  
# Empower Teams with Problems to Solve  
Let's contrast this with an empowered product team. In this case,  
rather than providing the product team with a roadmap of features  
and projects to build, the product team is instead given  
a set of  
problems to solve and desired outcomes to achieve  
.  
It is not difficult to sit down with the relevant stakeholders and work  
backward from the specific features they are requesting to what the  
underlying problem is for the customer or for the business, and then  
discuss how success would be measured and what the desired  
outcome is.  
Rather than simply implementing the features desired by the  
stakeholders, an empowered product team is tasked with coming up  
with a solution that works for both the customer  
and  
the business.  
This means coming up with a solution that is  
valuable  
—the  
customer will decide to buy or use it;  
usable  
—the user will be able to  
figure out how to use it;  
feasible  
—your engineers know how to solve  
with the time, skills, and technology on the team; and  
viable  
—the  
solution will work for your business in terms of constraints in  
marketing, sales, finance, service, legal, and compliance.  
Why is an empowered product team necessarily any better than  
feature teams?  
Besides obvious reasons, such as improved morale resulting from a  
much greater sense of ownership and the knowledge gained in  
testing potential solutions directly with your users and customers,  
the major reason is because strong product companies understand  
that  
empowered engineers are absolutely essential to innovation  
,  
and empowered product teams are designed to tap into this powerful  
asset.  
In a feature team, the engineers are there simply to build what is  
requested, and the designers are there to make it look pretty. They are effectively  
mercenaries  
. Even worse, if you outsource your  
engineers, they are quite literally mercenaries.  
But in an empowered product team, the engineers are not just there  
to build, and the designers are not just there to design. They are also  
responsible for helping to  
identify the right solution  
. This is what is  
meant by the term “empowered product teams.”  
The advantage that the engineers have is that they are working with  
the enabling technology every single day, which puts them in the  
ideal position to see what's  
just now possible  
.  
When these empowered engineers work collaboratively with product  
managers and product designers, and are exposed directly to users  
and customers, you can start to see where nearly every innovative  
product or service you love originates from.  
We are admittedly emphasizing the role of empowered engineers  
here especially hard, but that is because companies that have not yet  
transformed typically require the biggest philosophical shift in terms  
of how they think about engineers. Evidence of that fact is the degree  
of outsourcing of engineers versus the other roles.  
When combined with a strong product designer trained in the craft  
of designing effective and engaging user experiences and a capable  
product manager trained in understanding both customers and the  
constraints of your business, you have the cross-functional set of  
skills necessary to solve hard problems in ways your customers love  
yet work for your business.  
# Product Discovery  
While time to market is still important for an empowered product  
team held accountable to results, what is most important is  
time to  
money  
—in other words, the time to achieve the necessary  
outcome  
.  
If an empowered product team ships a feature but does not see the  
necessary impact, then they iterate on that feature or on their  
approach until they do.  
With time to money as the goal of the product team, the incentive  
moves to being able to quickly determine if a particular product idea  
or approach will work. This is referred to as  
product discovery  
. The product team could simply build their various ideas and see  
what works, but this would take much more time and expose your  
customers to a lot of bad ideas. Instead, the product team has a full  
battery of tools and techniques to quickly test ideas and approaches.  
Mostly, the product team creates  
prototypes  
, which come in various  
forms, but all are very fast and inexpensive to create. Each prototype  
is designed to test different risks or assumptions.  
The general rule of thumb is that any idea tested in product  
discovery should be  
at least  
one order of magnitude less expensive  
and faster than using the engineers to build, test, and deploy an  
actual product. In many cases, the prototypes are two orders of  
magnitude less expensive than the product.  
If, on average, it takes three to five iterations for a typical feature to  
reach the point where it generates the necessary business results  
\(time to money\), and if a feature team is being used to build each of  
these iterations, taking several months for each iteration, then you're  
often talking on the order of one to two years before a feature  
generates the desired returns. And that's  
only  
in the rare case the  
stakeholders are willing to continue to put these necessary iterations  
on the product roadmap.  
In contrast, if the empowered product team is assigned the problem  
to solve and it's staffed with the skills needed to perform product  
discovery, then those three to five iterations can happen in a small  
number of days or weeks, and the product version is in the  
customer's  
hands—generating the necessary business results—  
usually just a few weeks after that.  
If you've ever wondered how small, empowered product teams can so  
consistently outproduce much larger companies spending much  
more on their feature teams, this is right at the heart of the answer.  
We discuss how to develop the skills necessary for changing how you  
solve problems in  
chapter 17  
, “Product Discovery.”  
# True Collaboration with Stakeholders  
Beyond saving money and time, the more important benefit of  
changing how you solve problems is that you are creating the mechanism to consistently create value for your customers.  
Instead of feature teams there to  
serve the stakeholders in your  
business  
, you now have empowered product teams designed to  
serve  
your customers, in ways that work for your business  
.  
This difference is not minor, and it fundamentally changes the  
dynamics of your organization.  
But be warned\:  
Some key stakeholders will not be happy about losing control over  
the technology resources. It is likely that some will resist passively,  
and a few actively. This is why—without the visible and real  
support from the very top of the organization—transformations so  
often fail  
.  
It's also important to point out that some of your current product  
managers, product designers, and engineers may not be willing or  
able to take on this additional responsibility.  
In truth, it is much harder to take responsibility for solving customer  
problems than it is to just build the features you've been told to  
build. You will need to ensure that you have staffed the right level of  
people on your product teams and that they are provided with the  
necessary coaching and context for them to succeed. See  
part III  
,  
Product Model Competencies  
.  
Strong, cross-functional, empowered product teams composed of  
product managers, product designers, and engineers—working  
together to solve customer problems in ways that your customers  
love  
yet work for your business—is the essential core concept of the  
product model. See  
chapter 15  
, “Product Teams.” Outcome-Based Roadmaps  
If you're working on changing how you solve problems, this begs  
the question\: Where are the problems coming from?  
In prior models, problems usually are coming from stakeholders  
as they prioritize their needs in a product roadmap. In a company  
that's moved to the product model, these problems instead come  
from an insight-driven product strategy.  
But what if you want to focus on building your skills in solving  
problems, before you tackle the product leadership skills of  
product strategy?  
For this situation, there is a helpful transformation tactic called  
outcome-based roadmaps  
.  
If you go to your stakeholders today and ask them for problems to  
solve, that's likely to cause confusion because most product  
roadmaps are actually a list of  
outputs  
. Rather than problems to  
solve, they are features to build.  
Fortunately, it's not difficult to reverse engineer the problem to  
solve.  
The way this works is that you start with your existing output-  
oriented product roadmap, but then you go through each item on  
that roadmap and determine what problem each feature is hoping  
to solve, and what the measure of success \(expected outcome\) is.  
You will still be working on the same problems that you would  
have before transforming, but now you are providing your  
product teams with a degree of freedom as they explore potential  
solutions, which enables the teams to focus on outcomes. Then  
you can learn the techniques of product discovery to help you  
achieve those outcomes.  
An additional benefit of outcome-based roadmaps is that they  
help wean your stakeholders off talking in terms of features and  
dates and instead discussing problems to solve and outcomes. CHAPTER 9  
# Changing How You Decide Which  
# Problems to Solve  
So far we've talked about the need to change how you build and the  
need to change how you solve problems. But we haven't talked about  
how you decide  
which  
problems are the most important to solve.  
It is not hard simply to take your existing product roadmaps and, for  
each feature or project, to determine what the underlying problem to  
solve is and what the logical way to measure success would be. That's  
the simple and straightforward way to move from roadmaps of  
features to roadmaps of outcomes. \(This is referred to as an  
outcome-based roadmap  
—see the box in  
chapter 8  
.\)  
This is not a difficult step, and it's true that simply providing your  
empowered product teams with problems to solve—and clear  
measures of success—can go a long way toward generating  
significantly better solutions to those problems for your customers  
and your business.  
But are those really the most important problems to be solved for  
your customers and for your company?  
Every company has before it a set of opportunities and faces a set of  
threats.  
How rigorous is your company in selecting the  
best  
opportunities to  
pursue and focusing on those threats that you should take seriously?  
# Disrupting Product Planning  
In most stakeholder-driven, feature-team companies, there is some  
form of an annual product-planning process. Here, the stakeholders  
make their cases for the projects they think are most important to be  
done. In many of these companies, the finance organization plays the role  
of arbiter and makes decisions based on submitted business cases.  
In other companies, the stakeholders get in front of the senior  
leadership to plead their case, and the senior leadership team makes  
the decisions.  
Yet, companies that genuinely care about accountability track the  
results delivered versus the promises made, and they know that  
neither of these approaches results in consistently good decisions,  
primarily because they don't have good data going in. The book  
INSPIRED  
goes into detail about why this is the case and what good  
product teams do instead.  
Product planning is about deciding which problems you need to  
solve. Changing  
how you decide which problems to solve  
is the third  
dimension of moving to the product model.  
# Disrupting Yourselves Before You're Disrupted  
It's very easy to overlook just how fundamental this change is, and  
not recognize that it is the essential ingredient in so many companies  
that have disrupted  
themselves  
before they've been disrupted by  
others  
.  
Suppose you know that, due to competitive pressures and changes in  
customer needs and behaviors, you need a substantially new  
generation  
of your core product. But you also realize that the needed  
changes will run deep—impacting how your products are created,  
marketed, sold, delivered, and serviced.  
No matter how many company offsites you hold or how many  
management consultants you bring in, do you  
really  
believe that, at  
the end of the day, each of the stakeholders in your company will do  
what's necessary to disrupt themselves?  
And even if they wanted to, the odds that the answer is in the  
conference room they are sitting in is incredibly unlikely. It is very  
challenging to innovate meaningfully that far away from the  
technology and from the customer.  
We'll guess you've probably realized that's very unlikely to happen. The product model understands this reality. It's not that the product  
organization is given carte blanche to do what's necessary. But with  
the support of the CEO, the product leaders and product teams work  
with the stakeholders to drive the necessary changes across the  
organization.  
You'll see this very dynamic play out in each of the three detailed  
transformation stories in this book—Trainline \(  
part V  
\), Datasite \(  
part VII  
\), and Adobe \(  
part IX  
\)—but let's start with a high-level  
description of what's happening.  
# Customer-Centric Product Vision  
So many companies spend their time  
reacting  
—reacting to new  
sales opportunities, reacting to competitors’ offerings, reacting to  
customer requests, reacting to price pressure, and more. Yet, strong  
product companies care about these factors, but they are not driven  
by them.  
What drives these companies is the pursuit of a product vision that  
can meaningfully improve the lives of their customers.  
In fact, in a strong product company, a compelling and inspiring  
product vision is your single best tool for recruiting the people on  
your product teams. The people you want on your teams are  
precisely those who believe in your product vision. They want to  
make a difference in the lives of your customers.  
A strong product vision will inspire an organization for many years  
\(most run three to ten years\).  
It's important to note that the product vision is, first and foremost,  
about the  
customer  
. How will it make the lives of your users and  
customers better?  
It is  
not  
about how you are going to make more money, or what your  
priorities should be for the quarter, or how you'll structure your  
product teams. These other topics are important, and we discuss  
those goals next, but the purpose of the product vision is to  
describe  
the future that you are trying to create  
.  
You may have dozens or even hundreds of product teams, but the  
product vision is what unites the teams with the shared goal of making that vision a reality.  
1  
# Insight-Driven Product Strategy  
While the product vision describes the future, the product strategy is  
how you identify the most important problems to solve  
now  
.  
The product strategy begins by focusing on the most critical areas for  
business success. The reality is that most companies try to do too  
many things at once. So, they end up diluting their efforts and  
making too little progress on the true levers for the business.  
As legendary CEO Jim Barksdale said,  
“The main thing is to keep the  
main thing the main thing.”  
Or, if you prefer the Russian proverb\:  
“If you chase two rabbits, you  
will not catch either one.”  
Once you have identified the few key focus areas, you then need to  
select the  
insights  
that you will be betting on.  
You are constantly investigating the quantitative insights—mainly  
derived from the data that's generated—and also the qualitative  
insights—mainly resulting from talking directly to your customers.  
You're also continuously evaluating the potential of new enabling  
technologies and the implications of relevant industry and  
technology trends.  
This type of insight-driven product strategy usually requires  
developing new muscles for the company, but the reward for strong  
product strategy is to get the most out of your technology  
investment.  
Good product strategy is a force multiplier  
.  
It's important to understand that product strategy is distinct from  
both  
business  
strategy and  
go-to-market  
strategy. Many companies  
have strong skills in business strategy and/or go-to-market strategy,  
but product strategy is often missing completely.  
In fact, in most feature-team companies, the product strategy is  
literally to try to deliver as many features as possible for the different  
stakeholders. Which is to say, there really isn't a product strategy at  
all. The Role of Product Leadership  
Most companies that want to transform understand that they need to  
dial up the level of their product teams. Hiring more senior  
engineers. Hiring skilled product designers. Hiring competent  
product managers.  
But many companies are surprised to learn that they often have even  
larger gaps in their product leadership.  
In fact, many feature-team companies really don't have any product  
leadership to speak of. Since they rarely have a product vision, and  
are even less likely to have a product strategy, the job of a “head of  
product” in a feature-team company is completely different from the  
same title in a company operating in the product model.  
More generally, in the product model, the product leaders play the  
primary role in coaching and developing their people to have the  
skills to discover and deliver solutions effectively and successfully.  
In the product model, the leaders of product management, product  
design, and engineering are absolutely essential not only to changing  
how you decide which problems to solve, but also to changing how  
you solve problems and changing how you build.  
We discuss how to develop the necessary skills in deciding what  
problems to solve in  
chapter 16  
, “Product Strategy.” The One Right Way?  
A very common but damaging misconception in the broader  
product community is that many people try to argue there's only  
one right way to build great products.  
Sometimes this confusion happens because a person or team will  
try out a method or technique or process and have a great result,  
so they think that all they have to do is replicate what they had  
done earlier.  
More often, this confusion is motivated by people and businesses  
that just want to sell you their particular process, framework,  
methodology, or tool.  
But the product operating model is a  
conceptual model  
.  
It's a way for you to  
think  
about the work. It is not a prescription.  
It is not a process. There is no single framework or methodology  
or tool.  
The reality of product work is that you have a tremendous range  
of problems to solve, each with different risk profiles, different  
types of customers, different types of technologies, and different  
constraints to satisfy.  
Even if there was one approach that could succeed for everything,  
that approach would certainly be overkill—too slow and too  
expensive—for the vast majority of less complex work.  
Building a consumer device is very different from building an AI-  
powered SaaS service. Even within a single product organization,  
there are often dramatically different product situations.  
This is why we focus on the product model  
principles  
. The  
principles apply no matter the complexity, the customer, the  
technology, or the industry.  
So, when you assess an organization, you need to look below the  
surface to understand what the context is, and whether the team  
is making appropriate choices. There are examples of this confusion everywhere. Earlier we  
mentioned how many organizations follow Agile rituals and  
ceremonies, use Agile coaches, and staff the Agile roles, yet they  
only release monthly or even quarterly. Contrast that with so  
many strong product  
companies that don't see the need for Agile  
methods or roles or rituals, yet they have long practiced  
continuous delivery. It's not hard to see which organization is  
actually being true to the principles underlying Agile.  
Another example has to do with the various product  
competencies. There are strong product companies that combine  
competencies. For example, it's not uncommon for a product  
designer to also be a front-end engineer. There are clear  
advantages to this, although the pool of candidates is significantly  
smaller. Yet the real question is not how these companies define  
the designer role; it is how they use those designers to minimize  
waste, address risks, and create valuable and usable products.

. PART III  
# Product Model Competencies  
In prior models, product teams exist to serve the needs of the  
business or, more accurately, the business leaders.  
But in the product model,  
product teams exist to solve hard  
problems for your customers and for your business, in ways your  
customers love, yet work for the business  
.  
This difference may sound minor, but the consequences are quite  
significant in terms of how teams work and how they interact with  
the rest of the company.  
Consider for a moment the implications of this. We are essentially  
pushing the decisions and responsibility for finding the best solution  
to the problem down to the relevant product team, and then holding  
that team accountable for the results.  
This is what drives the need for the new product core competencies.  
Strong products are created by strong product teams, and strong  
product teams are staffed with the critical new product  
competencies.  
In this section, we discuss each of these critical new core  
competencies so that you know what to look for and what to expect,  
and are not fooled when someone adopts a new title but doesn't have  
the necessary skills or experience to back it up.  
It's important not to underestimate the effort to establish these new  
competencies. Everything that follows in this book is built upon  
these competencies.  
To be very clear, unless you are willing to establish these new  
competencies, your transformation hopes will likely end here.  
It's important to acknowledge that these new competencies can feel  
threatening to people who have built their careers around different  
competencies. Some will view the product model as a major career opportunity and  
a chance to stay relevant for years to come. Others will dismiss the  
topic, thinking they already do this, and others will simply prefer to  
wait it out in hopes that the leaders will lose interest after a few  
months.  
It's also important to emphasize that many of your existing people  
can be coached and developed into strong contributors with the  
necessary competencies. But don't expect that to be true of all of  
them.  
And everything depends on your people  
wanting  
to learn and then  
having leaders or product coaches that are  
capable  
of helping your  
people learn these new competencies.  
In this part, we describe each of the new core competencies, but not  
in enough detail that you can learn them.  
Each of these specialized competencies normally takes years to learn.  
In fact, we have published two other books that attempt to teach the  
skills and techniques needed for these competencies.  
Rather, we want to describe the new competencies such that  
you  
understand the need for these competencies and you know what  
you can and should expect from people with these job titles  
.  
We also want you to start thinking now about changing your job  
descriptions and career ladders to reflect and secure these new  
competencies.  
One of the challenges in transformation is that many people have  
adopted the new titles of the product model without actually  
learning  
the new competencies. This problem is much more severe  
than you might imagine.  
We want to give you the tools to be able to judge competence  
effectively.  
# Product Managers, Product Designers, and  
# Engineers  
A typical cross-functional product team requires three specific and  
very distinct skill sets. Usually that means at least three people. But sometimes a single  
person is able to cover multiple skill sets or, in certain specific cases,  
the particular product may only require two of the skill sets.  
Recall that when solving problems for your customers or your  
business, you need to come up with solutions that your customers  
love, yet work for your business.  
To discover an effective solution, the team is responsible for  
addressing four different types of risks\:  
1  
1\. Value risk  
. Will the customer buy our solution or choose to use  
it?  
2\. Viability risk  
. Will this solution work for our business? Is it  
something we can effectively and legally market, sell, service,  
fund, and monetize?  
3\. Usability risk  
. Can users easily learn, use, and perceive the  
value of the solution?  
4\. Feasibility risk  
. Do we know how to build and scale this  
solution with the staff, time, technology, and data we have?  
In a cross-functional product team, these are the critical  
competencies and what each is responsible and accountable for\:  
The  
product manager  
is responsible for the  
value  
and  
viability  
risks and is overall accountable for achieving the  
product's  
outcomes  
.  
The  
product designer  
is responsible for the  
usability  
risk and  
is overall accountable for the product's  
experience  
—every  
interaction your users and customers have with your product.  
The  
tech lead  
is responsible for the  
feasibility  
risk and is  
overall accountable for the product's  
delivery  
.  
It's also important to realize that each of these three competencies  
can and do contribute to all aspects of the solution, but it's helpful to  
know who specifically is held accountable for each risk. As you'll see, the skills required to develop each of these  
competencies are substantial.  
# Product Leaders  
Product leaders are the managers of product management, product  
design, and engineering.  
These are the people who will need to recruit, onboard, coach, and  
develop the actual product managers, product designers, and  
engineers.  
In addition to building and coaching the product teams, these  
product leaders have critical responsibilities related to creating a  
compelling and inspiring product vision, an insight-driven product  
strategy, and a carefully crafted team topology, and to defining the  
critical problems to solve and business outcomes to achieve.  
More generally, these leaders are responsible for ensuring that the  
product organization is aligned with the broader company in  
pursuing the best opportunities and addressing the most serious  
threats and in influencing the stakeholders/ecosystem around the  
product teams to make this change successfully.  
This is why people you select as your product leaders will very likely  
prove critical to your transformation efforts.  
If you don't yet have product leaders with the necessary skills and  
experience, then your first choice is to recruit them and get them in  
place for the kickoff of your transformation work.  
That said, in many companies, product leaders have some but not all  
the necessary experience, and external product leadership coaches  
can temporarily supplement their knowledge.  
# Other Impacted Roles  
Finally, it is important to point out that there are a few other roles  
that are significantly impacted by the move to the product model.  
One is product marketing and another is project management \(aka  
delivery management\). These and other roles are discussed later in  
the book. Note  
1  
There are other risk taxonomies besides the one we present in this  
book. The main alternative is from the product design firm IDEO,  
which breaks down the risks as\:  
desirability, feasibility,  
and  
viability  
. In other words, IDEO combines value and usability  
risks into one risk termed  
desirability  
. The most important point  
is to use some kind of risk taxonomy to ensure you are  
considering all the important risks. That said, we have found that  
the IDEO taxonomy works better for consumer products \(where  
every user is also the buyer\) than it does for business products, as  
it is too easy to confuse and conflate whether a user  
can use  
a  
product versus whether a customer  
will buy  
a product. CHAPTER 10  
# Product Managers  
We will warn you now that this is consistently the most difficult  
new competency to establish  
.  
Your company very likely already has people with the title “product  
manager.” However, if this is the case, it is also likely that these  
people were simply retitled from other roles, such as “product  
owner” or “business analyst” or “program manager.”  
The reason this competency is so messy is because your prior model  
very likely had a role with the same “product manager” title, but in  
the prior models, that is a completely different job, with very  
different skills and responsibilities.  
The result is that when it comes to this title, you will need to look  
deeper to determine on a case-by-case basis which of your people  
truly have the necessary skills, and if not, whether you believe that  
with skilled coaching they will be able to achieve the necessary level  
of competency in a reasonable amount of time.  
As discussed earlier, in the prior models, the stakeholders \(if anyone\)  
are implicitly responsible for the  
value  
and  
viability  
of the solutions  
that are built. But in the product model, the product manager is  
explicitly responsible for ensuring the value and viability.  
Value  
requires a deep understanding of your users and customers,  
and  
viability  
requires a solid understanding of your business.  
The book  
INSPIRED  
goes into depth on this role, so we won't try to  
duplicate that here, other than to make sure you are able to assess  
whether the people in this role will be able to do the job that is  
necessary.  
Understanding your customers means not only being an expert on  
how your users and customers choose and use your products—both  
qualitatively and quantitatively—but also understanding the market, the competitive landscape, and the relevant technology and industry  
trends.  
Understanding your business means learning how your product is  
funded, monetized, manufactured, marketed, sold, delivered, and  
serviced, as well as any legal, contractual, or compliance constraints.  
It is normal for a new product manager to need on the order of two  
to three months to come up to speed on your customers and your  
business—and that's with the active coaching of a capable manager.  
Without that active coaching from a strong manager, the person  
could easily be in the job for multiple years and still not have the  
necessary knowledge. The most common visible symptom of this  
situation is a lack of trust in that product manager by the company's  
stakeholders.  
Realize that because normally the engineers and the product  
designer do not have this knowledge \(although we love it when they  
do\), if the product team is to be able to make good choices as they  
work to discover an effective solution, they need this knowledge to  
come from somewhere.  
One clear sign that the product team lacks a competent product  
manager is that all decisions require either an escalation to a  
manager or a stakeholder meeting where the stakeholders are asked  
to decide.  
To set your expectations about the necessary level of skill required  
for this competency, here are two candid realities\:  
1\. Your head of product will be judged by her  
weakest  
product  
manager.  
2\. Your CEO should believe that each of your product managers  
has  
the potential  
to be a future leader of your company in the  
next five or so years.  
While there are definitely exceptions, the majority of legacy business  
analysts and Agile-focused product owners simply do not reach this  
bar. Those legacy jobs are very narrowly defined roles as compared to a  
product manager in the product model, with much less specific  
knowledge required.  
Realize that your product managers will need to establish trust-based  
relationships with your major customers as well as with your key  
stakeholders. It takes strong people to do this.  
Unfortunately, the reason why so many transformations are destined  
to failure is that the company is not willing to enforce this standard  
on the people they call product managers, so the product teams do  
not contain the necessary cross-functional skills, the stakeholders  
don't trust the teams, the product teams are not able to deliver the  
necessary outcomes, and the attempt to move to the product model  
collapses.  
If you believe you can simply retitle your product owners or business  
analysts, you are very likely heading for failure.  
While it is very possible that you currently have several people who  
will need to find other roles where they are better suited for success,  
it is equally likely that you currently have very strong candidates for  
the product manager role scattered across your organization.  
A very important part of transformation is identifying these high-  
potential people, getting them into this critical role, and providing  
them the necessary coaching to succeed.  
Look for people with a broad understanding of business and the  
proven ability to quickly learn other parts of the business. Look for  
people who are comfortable immersing in the data to understand  
behavior and trends. Look for people who want to get face-to-face  
with real users and customers. Look for people who are willing to roll  
up their sleeves around a whiteboard with designers and engineers to  
try to come up with solutions that solve for many different  
constraints.  
Look for people who love to quickly learn as much as  
they can and collaborate to solve hard problems.  
One final attempt at impressing upon you how important this point  
is\: If you are thinking that because your company hires only good  
people, this isn't a problem for you, in our experience, you are on  
your way to a failed transformation. Direct Access  
For the product team to discover and deliver effective solutions, it  
is absolutely critical that they—especially the product manager—  
have  
direct  
,  
unencumbered access to  
these three constituencies\:  
1\. Users and customers  
2\. Product data  
3\. Business stakeholders  
Direct Access to Users and Customers  
Without direct, unencumbered access to actual users and  
customers, the product team has little hope of any kind of  
success.  
Users and customers provide not only inspiration for  
unaddressed problems but also the means to rapidly test your  
proposed solutions.  
It should be intuitively clear why the product manager and  
product designer need direct access to users and customers, but  
less obvious is the importance of providing your engineers with  
direct access to the users.  
It's important to acknowledge that you don't need all your  
engineers to tag along on every customer or user interaction. But  
“the magic happens” when an engineer sees a user struggling with  
their product, so the more you can encourage and facilitate this  
interaction, the better.  
Of course, you need to be sure your people have been trained and  
coached on appropriate interactions with customers, but the key  
here  
is not to let anyone prevent product teams from having  
direct access to customers—not a sales or marketing person, not a  
customer success person, not a user researcher, not a customer's  
vendor manager. No one.  
1  
That said, there's no reason you can't occasionally include others  
in your direct interactions with users. For example, it can be very impactful to include a key stakeholder, or an interested executive,  
especially when you see that shared empathy is needed.  
Direct Access to Product Data  
Similarly, the product manager needs direct access to the product  
data in order to make good decisions based on that data.  
Usually several data sources contain different types of data—such  
as how your users are interacting with your product, how your  
customers purchase your products, and how your customers’  
behaviors are changing over time.  
The product team may have access to data analysts and data  
scientists to help explain complex data patterns, but decisions  
based on this data are the responsibility of the product manager,  
so she needs direct data access.  
In some companies, certain people want to restrict access to this  
data, and it is important that customer privacy and security be  
maintained.  
You can create systems that enforce the appropriate types of  
governance, access, anonymization, and aggregation that may be  
required but still give teams direct access to essential data.  
As with direct access to customers, direct access to data is  
fundamental to the product model. Without direct access to the  
data, the product manager is flying blind.  
Direct Access to Business Stakeholders  
Discovering a solution that works for your business is about  
solving for the various business constraints—marketing, sales,  
services, finance, legal, compliance, manufacturing, subject  
matter experts, and more. And it's essential that the product  
manager has direct access to the leaders across your business  
who are responsible for these constraints.  
The product manager must establish relationships with these  
people, putting in real time and effort to learn the concerns and  
needs of the various stakeholders. Stakeholders must genuinely  
believe that the product manager understands the relevant constraints and will ensure they are considered and addressed in  
any proposed solution. And the product manager will discuss  
with stakeholders before building anything in that gray area  
where viability is not certain.  
This trust between product manager and stakeholders is critical  
to the healthy collaboration that's needed to find effective  
solutions that solve for both the customer and the business.  
Direct access to users and customers, direct access to data, and  
direct access to stakeholders is key.  
Direct, ongoing access to these three constituencies is what  
enables the product manager to ensure the value and viability of  
the solutions that are built  
.  
If your product managers are prevented from accessing any of  
these three constituencies, then they are very likely going to fail.  
What all this means is that you need to ensure the product team's  
direct access to these three constituencies and fight any attempt  
to place a well-meaning person, or cumbersome process, between  
the product manager and these constituencies.  
In some companies, especially those with a legacy of outsourcing  
engineers, the product manager needs direct, unencumbered  
access to an additional group\: the engineers.  
This should be the most obvious statement in the world, but it is  
not obvious to many people coming from the IT model. Access to  
engineers may not be a given for those working in environments  
where…  
The engineers are outsourced  
The engineers are located in time zones where interaction is  
difficult, or it is believed that engineers need to be sheltered  
so they aren't interrupted while they code  
The product team is split up such that the product manager  
interacts with customers and stakeholders, and some other  
person—such as a product owner or project manager—  
interacts with the engineers Because the engineers are working daily with the enabling  
technology, they are in the ideal position to understand what's  
just now possible  
. But this only happens in a way that is  
actionable when engineers are interacting with the product  
manager every day.  
At an absolute minimum, the product manager needs direct  
access to the tech lead. What About Domain Expertise?  
You may have noticed that one attribute noticeably missing from  
the description of a strong product manager is  
domain expertise  
.  
For example, if your product is an insurance product, just how  
much do you need to know about insurance?  
The reason this is a such an important topic is because it is so  
common for companies that are transforming to hire product  
managers out of their customer base or others with deep domain  
experience.  
However, in most cases, this turns out to be a mistake. It is likely  
no surprise that someone who knows too little about the domain  
will struggle to do the job. What is much more surprising is the  
problems that are caused when a product manager knows  
too  
much  
about the domain.  
To be clear, we expect new product managers to become expert in  
their domain in their first months of onboarding in the role. This  
is  
about the dangers of hiring people  
because  
of their preexisting  
domain experience.  
Product thought leader Shreyas Doshi refers to true domain  
expertise as domain  
knowledge  
minus domain  
dogma  
. For so  
many people who spend many years immersed in the domain, it  
is very difficult to distinguish dogma from expertise. The problem  
is that the domain dogma seriously impedes innovation. These  
are the people who can recite all the reasons something  
won't  
work, until someone comes along without that dogma and shows  
that it  
can  
work.  
For certain domains where deep domain expertise is required, we  
will hire a dedicated domain expert who can be shared by the  
various product teams, such as surgical instruments, tax  
preparation, or regulatory reporting.  
Note 1  
Most companies intuitively understand the need for product  
teams to engage directly with users and customers, but objections  
arise in some companies. We cover these in  
part X  
,  
Overcoming  
Objections  
. For now, understand that product teams directly  
interacting with customers on an ongoing basis is absolutely  
fundamental to the product model. CHAPTER 11  
# Product Designers  
Most companies transforming to the product model already have  
some number of designers, but they typically play a very different  
role than what's needed in the product model.  
In the prior models, designers too often play a service role to a  
product manager, or they support the marketing organization, none  
of which is what we need.  
In terms of what we need in the product model, there are really two  
issues here\: how the product works, and product discovery.  
# How the Product Works  
The first issue is that in the prior models, the designers often have a  
much smaller range of skills. They are usually graphic or visual  
designers, and while those are definitely helpful skills, as Steve Jobs  
famously said,  
“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.  
Design is how it works.”  
In the product model, we need designers to take on a much larger  
role, responsible for the holistic customer experience and how the  
user and customer experience the product's value.  
In the product model, we refer to the designers as  
product designers  
, and we need designers who are skilled in service design, interaction  
design, visual design, and, in the case of devices, industrial design.  
We don't need product designers to be expert in  
all  
these forms of  
design, but for most products, it is critical that the product designer  
has proven interaction design knowledge and skills.  
Interaction design is about understanding how technology and  
people \(users and customers\) communicate with each other.  
Product Discovery The second issue is that your current designers generally are brought  
in at the end to “make things pretty” or at least to apply a veneer so  
that it appears your products all come from the same company.  
Instead, you need product designers who can help  
discover an  
effective solution  
.  
Skilled product designers are trained to engage directly with users  
and customers to get inside their heads—to understand how they  
think about the problem you are working to solve for them and how  
they think about your potential solutions. They strive to design  
holistic experiences  
that will feel recognizable and intuitive to your  
users and customers.  
Moreover, skilled product designers not only design experiences,  
they intentionally design  
changes to those experiences  
.  
When the changes are designed well, users don't even notice the  
constant stream of changes and improvements, but when users do  
notice them, the experience guides them through the changes rather  
than requiring any form of retraining or disruption.  
The product designer is the key partner for the product manager and  
the tech lead in the daily product discovery work. The product  
designer usually takes the lead in expressing the product ideas in the  
form of prototypes that you can experience, consider, evaluate, and  
test.  
It's not uncommon for a typical designer to create a dozen or  
more prototypes in a week. Although most of them will get thrown  
away, every one of them helps you converge on an effective solution.  
To set your expectations, due to the level of skill required and the  
market demand for product designers at companies following the  
product model, these highly valued professionals are generally  
compensated at the level of a product manager and an engineer.  
Normally, each product team that is responsible for user-facing  
products or services would have a dedicated product designer.  
As more companies move to the product model, and as more types of  
product companies—such as those that sell to large businesses—  
realize they need the help of product designers, demand for these  
professionals continues to grow. CHAPTER 12  
# Tech Leads  
There is an important difference when discussing engineers versus  
product managers or product designers.  
With product managers and product designers, you only have one  
dedicated person per cross-functional product team. So, there are  
quite a few responsibilities and expectations for each of those people.  
However, there are usually multiple engineers on each product team.  
Different types of product teams—working with different  
technologies and with different scopes of responsibility—will need a  
larger or smaller number of engineers with a range of specialized  
knowledge.  
But because you have multiple engineers, you can have a mix of skills  
and experience levels. For example, on a given product team, it is  
normal to have at least one senior engineer covering the tech lead  
role, some engineers with a few years of experience, and maybe a  
couple of engineers who are just starting their careers.  
Some companies prefer their engineers to have more experience, and  
others prefer those just starting their careers so they can coach good  
habits from the start. This choice is up to the head of engineering.  
What we need to discuss here is the role of the most senior  
engineers, which we refer to here as  
tech leads  
.  
1  

To be clear, the  
tech lead is normally an individual contributor and not an  
engineering manager.  
There are two dimensions when we talk about the difference between  
engineers in the product model versus engineers in the prior models.  
The first dimension has to do with the complexity of the solutions  
that product companies build versus typical “IT systems.”  
It's important to acknowledge that nearly all technology looks easier  
until you actually get deep into it. But that said, there are some fairly significant differences around scale, performance, fault tolerance,  
reliability, internationalization, test automation, deployment  
infrastructure, new emerging technologies, and architecture and  
strategies for managing technical debt that distinguish product  
engineers. Experience with these techniques is extremely valuable, as  
mistakes in these areas can be very expensive.  
The second dimension has to do with whether the engineers are  
there simply to implement the solution that the product manager  
and product designer come up with or to help determine what the  
most effective solution is \(and then implement that solution\).  
Of all the principles underlying the product model, the single most  
important is the realization that innovation absolutely depends on  
empowered engineers  
.  
That's because the engineers are working with the enabling  
technology every day, which puts them in the best position to see  
what's just now possible.  
But that's  
only  
true if the engineers care just as much about  
what  
they build  
as  
how they build it  
.  
The old and misguided adage that “a PM is responsible for the  
what  
and  
why  
, and the engineer is responsible for the  
how  
” completely  
misses the point of empowered product teams and the source of real  
innovation.  
The primary reason for not outsourcing engineers in the product  
model is because they would be brought in far too late and would  
possess far too little understanding of the context or the customers to  
have any real chance at innovation.  
In an ideal world, all your engineers would be engaged in  
determining what the best solution is, not just engaged in building  
that solution.  
That said, it's not unusual for some of the engineers, especially the  
more junior engineers, to only care about building.  
You can succeed so long as  
at least the tech lead  
on each team is  
willing to partner with the product manager and product designer to  
discover an effective solution to the problem the team is working to  
solve. To be explicit on this critical point,  
if the tech lead is unable or  
unwilling to engage in product discovery, then you are very likely  
guaranteeing that the eventual product will not achieve your goals  
.  
It really is essential that you establish this as a formal part of the job  
description of the tech lead.  
In practice, this doesn't require much of the tech lead's time each  
day, but it does require some \(usually less than an hour a day, every  
day, of the lead engineer\).  
2  
Most tech leads will tell you that a few minutes weighing in on a  
product idea very early can save weeks or even months of damage  
control later if decisions are made without consulting with them.  
# Notes  
1  
In this book we use the term “tech lead” for the most senior  
individual contributor engineer on the team, but many different  
terms are used for this key role. The title you use is not important.  
The key is that the mandate to tech leads is to care just as much  
about  
what  
is built as  
how  
it is built.  
2  
Occasionally, we'll encounter an engineering team that has the  
opposite problem—they want to spend all their time in product  
discovery, usually because they are tired of just implementing  
what they consider to be an endless list of unhelpful features. You  
may need to remind these engineers that their primary  
responsibility is to build the products in delivery. But if you do  
encounter this situation, it's a good problem to have, and it's easy  
to correct. CHAPTER 13  
# Product Leaders  
So many people naively believe that the key to empowering product  
teams and the product model is simply to get the managers to back  
off, stop micromanaging, and give their product teams some space to  
do their jobs.  
But in the product model, empowered product teams depend on  
better  
leadership, not  
less  
leadership.  
What does that really mean?  
As legendary CEO Andy Grove said,  
“What gets in the way of good  
work? There are only two possibilities. The first is that people don't  
know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but  
they aren't motivated.”  
Let's tackle these two in order.  
# Management  
Let's first discuss the management responsibilities, which primarily  
involve coaching and staffing.  
# Coaching  
Probably the most often overlooked element to strong management  
in the product model is coaching. It is the single most important  
responsibility of every people manager to develop the skills of their  
people.  
This most definitely does  
not  
mean micromanaging them. It does  
mean assessing and understanding their strengths and weaknesses,  
coming up with a coaching plan, and then spending the quality time  
necessary to help them improve.  
More generally, every member of a product team deserves to have  
someone who is committed to helping them get better at their craft. This is why, in the vast majority of strong tech product organizations,  
the engineers report to experienced engineering managers, the  
designers report to experienced design managers, and the product  
managers report to proven managers of product management.  
The amount of time and effort you need to spend on coaching  
depends on the number and experience level of your people. But to  
set your expectations, it's normal for first-level managers to need to  
spend up to 80 percent of their workweek on staffing and coaching.  
# Staffing  
The managers are the people you hold responsible for staffing the  
product teams. This means sourcing, recruiting, interviewing,  
onboarding, evaluating, promoting, and, when necessary, replacing  
the members of the teams.  
If you have an HR function at your company, they are there to  
support your managers with these activities, but they are in no way a  
substitute for the hiring manager in these responsibilities. This point  
is critically important for your managers to understand.  
Because empowered product teams are predicated on competent  
product managers, product designers, and engineers, this starts with  
raising the bar on staffing and coaching.  
Taking staffing seriously is hard, and it takes a substantial amount of  
time and effort. You'll likely feel like this is not the product-related  
work you prefer to do.  
But as Jeff Bezos—Amazon founder and executive chairman—says,  
“Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will  
be, the single most important element of Amazon's success.”  
# Leadership  
There are essentially two main ways you can lead a product  
organization.  
You can lead by what's known as  
command and control  
, which  
means explicitly telling your people what you need them to do,  
usually by assigning them a roadmap of features and projects to build. In this model, the leaders and stakeholders make most of the  
meaningful decisions, and your product teams \(or, more accurately,  
feature teams\) are there to carry out those decisions. Admittedly,  
command and control is easier to do.  
The alternative is that you can lead by empowering the teams. You  
assign them business or customer problems to solve and then let the  
product teams determine the best way to solve those problems.  
However, if you choose to push key decisions down to the product  
teams, then you will need to provide those teams with the strategic  
context—especially the product vision and product strategy—  
necessary for them to make good decisions.  
If a leader finds herself disagreeing with where the empowered  
teams end up, or swooping in toward the end to change direction, it  
is worth some reflection on what context the leader could have given  
up front to make the feedback on the back end unnecessary. This is a  
new skill that requires reflection and improvement.  
This is why, for example, at Netflix the mantra is  
“Lead with context,  
not control.”  
The product leaders are specifically responsible for the product  
vision, the team topology, the product strategy, and the specific team  
objectives.  
Individuals on the product teams may contribute ideas or insights,  
and that's a great sign of a strong culture, but these are ultimately  
leadership responsibilities as they span  
all  
product teams.  
# Product Vision  
The product vision describes the future you are trying to create, and,  
most important, how the vision improves the lives of your customers.  
The product vision serves as the shared goal for the product  
organization. In terms of timeframe, it is usually between three and  
ten years out.  
There may be any number of cross-functional, empowered product  
teams—ranging from a few in a startup, to hundreds in a large  
enterprise—but they all need to head in the same direction and  
contribute in their own way to making the product vision a reality. Think about the product vision as a higher-altitude place to ensure  
alignment across the product teams and the stakeholders. If we can  
get alignment at this level, it will save a lot of debating about  
solutions later. Bringing everyone along also helps create empathy  
for users and customers.  
Some companies refer to the product vision as their North Star—in  
the sense that no matter what product team you're on and whatever  
specific problem you're trying to solve, you always know how your  
piece contributes to the more meaningful whole.  
More generally, the product vision is what keeps teams inspired and  
excited to come to work each day—month after month, year after  
year. It lets the teams proactively guide the product forward, rather  
than constantly reacting.  
It is worth noting that the product vision is typically the single most  
powerful recruiting tool for strong product people.  
Creating a compelling product vision is a bit different than the other  
elements of the strategic context. The product vision is more art than  
science. Its purpose is to  
persuade and inspire  
—it is meant to be  
emotional  
. You are talking about how you will improve the lives of  
your customers.  
You don't want so much detail that your teams think it's prescriptive,  
but you also need enough detail so people can really understand  
what you're trying to accomplish.  
While creating a good product vision is not easy, it is worth the effort  
because a good product vision is the gift that keeps on giving.  
So  
much of what you do derives from the product vision—the  
architecture, the team topology, the product strategy, and of course,  
your products for the next several years.  
# Team Topology  
The  
team topology  
refers to how you define the responsibilities and  
ownership of your different product teams. This includes the  
structure and scope of teams, and their relationship to one another.  
Many companies have an existing team topology that was not  
intentional; it is simply a reflection of their organization \(this common topology anti-pattern is known as Conway's Law\).  
Your goal with the topology is to maximize empowerment. You do  
that by striving for teams that are loosely coupled but highly aligned.  
Coming up with an effective team topology is one of the most  
difficult, but most important, responsibilities for product leaders,  
especially at scale. It requires intense collaboration and negotiation  
between the head of product, the head of design, and the head of  
engineering. The decisions you make impact the relationships and  
dependencies between the teams and what each team will actually  
own.  
When done well, your product teams are empowered with a high  
degree of autonomy, and they feel a real sense of ownership over  
their work and how it contributes to the greater whole. The teams  
can tackle hard problems, moving fast and seeing the results.  
# Product Strategy  
The  
product strategy  
describes how you plan to accomplish the  
product vision, while meeting the needs of the business as you go.  
The strategy starts with focus, then leverages insights, converts these  
insights into action, and finally manages the work through to  
completion. We dive into what all this means in  
chapter 16  
, “Product  
Strategy.”  
More generally, the product strategy helps you get the most value out  
of whatever number of product teams you have.  
The output of the product strategy is a set of business or customer  
problems to solve \(team objectives\) that the leaders will then need to  
assign to specific product teams.  
The product strategy is where strong product leaders distinguish  
themselves.  
They decide what the focus will be and what it won't be, and  
sometimes these decisions are not popular with other leaders. Strong  
product leaders live and breathe the data and insights about the  
product and constantly seek the points of leverage that power the  
product strategy. A strong product strategy can help a small  
organization outperform much larger competitors. Unfortunately, there are no easy shortcuts to a strong product  
strategy. It requires real time and effort to aggregate and assimilate  
the data and insights you'll need.  
# Team Objectives  
To execute on the product strategy, the leaders need to ensure that  
each product team has one or two clear objectives they have been  
assigned \(typically quarterly\), which spell out the problems they are  
being asked to solve.  
These objectives derive directly from the product strategy—it's where  
insights are turned into action.  
This is also where empowerment becomes real and not just a  
buzzword.  
The team is given a small number of significant problems to solve—  
the  
team objectives  
. The team then considers the problems and  
proposes clear measures of success \(the  
key results  
\), which they  
then discuss with their leaders. The leaders may need to iterate with  
their teams and others to try to get as much coverage as possible of  
the broader organization's objectives.  
The litmus test for empowerment is that the product team is able to  
decide the best way to solve the problems they have been assigned  
\(their team objectives\).  
It takes strong leaders to be self-confident and secure enough to truly  
empower the people who work for them and to stand back and let  
teams take credit for their successes.  
# Ongoing Evangelism  
The final critical role of the product leaders is communicating the  
product model and the strategic context—the product vision, team  
topology, and product strategy—both to the product organization  
and across the company more broadly.  
This requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting,  
onboarding, weekly 1\:1 coaching, all-hands meetings, team lunches,  
board meetings, customer briefings, and everything in between. The larger the organization, the more essential it is to be relentless at  
evangelism, and it's important for the leaders to understand that  
evangelism is something that is never finished. It needs to be  
constant.  
As you can see, the job of a product leader in a strong product  
company based on empowered product teams is both very different  
from the role in the prior models, and much more difficult.  
You will also notice that in each of the upcoming successful  
transformation case studies, the CEO took special care to ensure  
strong leaders of product management, product design, and  
engineering. Product Ops  
Product teams are in the business of trying out ideas quickly to  
determine if they work—before they spend the time and money to  
build a production-quality solution.  
Sometimes you make decisions based on data you collect, and  
sometimes you make the decisions based on talking with actual  
users and customers about their experiences using your products.  
Several companies have realized that, with a relatively small  
investment, they can increase the speed and effectiveness of their  
product teams by better supporting how those product teams  
make decisions.  
User researchers are experts at preparing for direct testing with  
users and customers, running those tests, and drawing the right  
conclusions from the results.  
Data analysts are experts at helping you prepare live data tests,  
collect the necessary amount of data to achieve a sufficient level  
of confidence, and draw the right conclusions from the results.  
Some companies build out large groups of user researchers and  
data analysts to run these tests  
for  
the product teams. While this  
might sound efficient, in such cases the product teams lack the  
benefit of the direct, intense, and very motivating interaction with  
customers and the results. And if the insights don't make it into  
the hearts and minds of the people on the product teams, the  
value of the insights is largely lost.  
1  
Other companies leave all user and live-data testing to product  
teams, which also can work. But the teams usually are not as  
knowledgeable of the best techniques and methods and  
sometimes they can draw the wrong conclusions—resulting in  
additional time, iteration, and testing.  
We have found what works best is to establish a small group of  
user researchers and data analysts who can coach and support a  
much larger group of product teams in moving quickly and  
making good decisions and in ensuring that insights are shared directly with product leaders, as these insights may benefit the  
next iteration of the product strategy.  
In many companies, these people live in different groups, but in  
some companies, these people are brought together under a small  
product ops  
function, which can be helpful in bringing visibility  
to this important supporting function.  
That said, you need to be very careful you don't set up any  
intermediaries, even when they have the best of intentions.  
As discussed, for a cross-functional product team to be effective  
and successful, it needs to have  
direct access  
to users and  
customers, direct access to the data those users generate, and  
direct access to the various stakeholders across the business.  
One note of warning\:  
Some companies define  
product ops  
very differently from how  
we've defined it here. The most serious issue is when a well-  
intentioned product ops group thinks it's their job to get in  
between the product teams and their users and customers, their  
data, or their stakeholders. Be careful that's not the case for you.  
Another danger that we discuss in more detail later is when the  
title “product ops” is used as a cover for a reconstituted program  
management office \(PMO\). This is a problem because old-style  
PMOs are often the manifestation of the command-and-control  
culture we're trying to replace. As you'll see, the prior model  
doesn't usually go away without a fight. So, you'll want to be  
aware of that possibility as well. The Impact of AI on Product Teams  
Newly developed AI technologies have enabled product teams to  
deliver a new generation of products and services able to solve  
existing problems in ways better than we have ever been able to  
solve them before, and these same technologies have also  
impacted the core competencies themselves.  
As with so many other jobs, product managers, product  
designers, and engineers are all benefiting from significant  
productivity improvements brought by tools that help automate  
many of the more tedious and mundane tasks, and more  
generally help research and evaluate new ideas. And we expect  
this to continue, especially in terms of tools for the engineers.  
But it is also true that, in many cases, there is more work to be  
done in terms of the ethical and business-viability risks.  
The result is that today, product teams are able to do more than  
ever, but in many cases the stakes are higher.  
As AI technologies and tools evolve, companies using the product  
model will continue to experiment with them—embracing and  
adopting what works.  
Just as you continuously evaluate how new technologies can be  
incorporated into your products to help your customers, strong  
product teams will continue to evaluate how new technologies  
can help you produce these products.

A recap of user research is about as useful as a recap of a vacation.  
The value comes in experiencing it. CHAPTER 14  
# Innovation Story\: Almosafer  
Marty's Note\: This is an example of impressive innovation from a  
region of the world not known for these types of technology-  
powered innovations. But one of the things I've learned over the  
years is that talent can be found all over the world, and when these  
people move to the product model, they are capable of remarkable  
levels of innovation. Strong leadership combined with strong  
product teams were able to rise to the challenges posed by the  
pandemic  
.  
# Company Background  
Almosafer \(part of Seera Group\) is a travel and tourism company  
based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \(KSA\) that now serves the  
wider Middle Eastern region. The company specializes in meeting  
local needs of the region's countries and cultures and also tourism  
and religious travel into the region from all over the world.  
The company began as brick-and-mortar travel agencies, and for  
many years these agencies served the personal, business, and  
government travel needs of the region.  
But as in the rest of the world, after the internet arrived, soon there  
were several very large, global travel providers, and many brick-and-  
mortar agents were struggling to compete.  
Those global travel providers offered the benefits of economies of  
scale, and technology-powered solutions, but they did very little to  
accommodate local needs, customs, and behaviors.  
In many regions of the world, there was a clear opportunity for a  
regional player to emerge that both understood local needs and also  
had the skills and technology to address those needs.  
By 2018, product leader Ronnie Varghese and technology leader Qais  
Amori—along with the other senior leaders of Almosafer—decided that to truly serve the customers in their region, they would need to  
build a digital team with the skills capable of discovering and  
delivering solutions that were superior to the global travel services.  
So, they set about transforming to the product model.  
This transformation work began in earnest in 2018, and soon this  
work was delivering real results for their business.  
Most important, they were building several new and essential  
muscles. They were now able to continuously interview customers to  
identify unmet needs, collect and analyze data to understand  
precisely what was working—and what wasn't—and quickly  
prototype and test out ideas. They were now able to discover  
solutions that their customers truly loved because they met their  
particular needs in ways that the major players simply didn't  
understand.  
During this first year, the company concentrated on two major areas\:  
significantly improving the customer experience and putting in place  
the technology infrastructure and architecture that would not only  
reduce its operational costs, but enable the company to innovate and  
serve their customers well into the future.  
In just the airline flights side of the travel business alone, the  
company was able to use these investments to grow to a billion-  
dollar business.  
Beyond the improvements in products, the digital team also built a  
reputation in the region as a different kind of company—one  
powered by a unique blend of talent and technology working like  
the  
best anywhere, and the company was proving to their community,  
their country, and the Middle East region that it could compete with  
anyone.  
The group was well on its way to creating one of the true regional  
success stories.  
Then the borders closed.  
# The Problem to Solve  
As with the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic largely  
brought travel to a halt. The KSA was hit especially hard because so much of its travel is international.  
Fortunately, the previous year had prepared the digital team to be  
able to solve hard problems, although the pandemic certainly would  
be a test.  
The teams had identified many potential opportunities through their  
continuous interaction with their customers—consumers and  
businesses. One such opportunity that they had observed earlier—  
but one that, with the pandemic, turned from an interesting  
possibility into an essential need—had to do with figuring out ways  
for family and friends to gather together safely.  
In Saudi Arabia, there had long been a cultural tradition of  
istiraha  
,  
which translates to “resting place,” but in general means a large,  
open courtyard or other outdoor area with room for grilling foods,  
sitting in the cool shade, and breathing fresh air. Families and  
friends would gather at an istiraha simply to be together or to  
celebrate special occasions.  
With the pandemic, and the need to avoid indoor gatherings, finding  
and reserving these istirahas quickly became a serious and unmet  
need. Unlike with hotels or airlines, there wasn't even any form of  
registry or listing of these unique accommodations.  
And as just one important difference, unlike lodging, where people  
reserve for the night, an istiraha is reserved from the afternoon to the  
evening of the same day.  
# Discovering the Solution  
The team knew this would be an especially risky type of product  
because the vast majority of products are new solutions to existing  
problems; this was a new solution to a  
new  
problem \(the need to find  
and book istirahas\).  
This required not just a strong solution, but the market also needed  
to be developed—essentially, the region had to be educated about  
this new type of offering in the marketplace.  
In offering a new type of booking in the travel marketplace, the  
product team would need to work closely with business development  
and marketing to identify the istirahas that would be available for rental, so that they could ensure the supply, while at the same time  
discover the necessary customer experience for those looking to book  
istirahas.  
The product team worked with product coach Hope Gurion \(profiled  
later in this book\) on this effort to ensure they quickly converged on  
a strong solution.  
Another challenge was that the product team needed to adjust their  
work to operate remotely. Because they had built their skills and  
their trust within the team, they were able to transition quickly and  
effectively to remote collaboration and remote research with  
customers—both problem and solution discovery.  
# The Results  
There were considerable unknowns with this new product. Nobody  
even knew just how many istirahas existed, let alone how many  
owners would be willing to list in the marketplace and then how  
many people would book.  
The team's initial business goal was to demonstrate product-market  
fit for this new marketplace offering, which they quickly established.  
After that, the focus was on growth, and istirahas are now an integral  
and rapidly growing category of the marketplace.  
Even beyond the financial success, this capability provided a real  
service to their country and region in a time of need, and few in the  
region have the illusion that any of the global travel companies  
would have cared enough to have invested anything.  
Today, Almosafer has a truly remarkable 70+ percent market share  
in the region.  
Such an extraordinary result is never from any single capability or  
offering. It is the result of a sustained effort of talent and technology  
to truly care for customers.  
Almosafer is one of the true success stories in the Middle East, and  
the company continues to expand to more countries in the region.  
They are well positioned to continue their growth and success. PART IV  
# Product Model Concepts  
Moving to the product model involves not just several new  
competencies, but also several critical concepts—essentially, new  
activities to help you consistently create effective products.  
Some of these concepts will resemble activities you've done in the  
past—although with very important differences—and others very  
likely will be completely new.  
This section is meant to explain these critical product model  
concepts.  
It's important to acknowledge that not everything involved in a  
transformation to the product model is equally important. A few  
concepts are absolutely critical, and those are the ones we discuss in  
the chapters that follow.  
Others are better characterized as helpful but not likely to make the  
difference between success and failure.  
Moreover, usually there are several possible paths to accomplish the  
same goals.  
That said, for the critical product model concepts, one way or  
another,  
you need to get them right  
.  
Get these critical concepts right, and you are very likely on your way  
to success. Get any of these critical concepts wrong, and things start  
to collapse.  
# Product Model First Principles  
Each of the critical concepts we describe is based on a set of  
product  
model first principles  
.  
These product model first principles represent the common beliefs in  
all the strong product companies we know, no matter whether they were born into the product model or if they have transformed. No  
matter if they are small or large. No matter if they serve consumers  
or businesses. No matter if they build software or devices.  
Moreover, if you understand these product model first principles,  
you can quickly judge whether a new process, or a new technique, or  
a new role—or even the experience of a prospective team member  
you are interviewing—is helpful or potentially harmful.  
# Product Model Concepts  
At the very foundation of the product model is the cross-functional,  
empowered  
product team  
. Most of what we discuss in this book is  
intended to help enable these product teams to do their work.  
Since no company has as many people or product teams as it wishes,  
you need to be smart about getting the most out of the people you  
have. Doing this means having an inspiring product vision combined  
with an insight-driven  
product strategy  
.  
In prior models, product strategy is much less relevant, as feature  
teams exist primarily to serve the needs of the business stakeholders.  
However, in the product model, product strategy plays a central and  
critical role in identifying the best product opportunities, as well as  
the most serious threats, to select the most critical problems to be  
solved.  
Once product teams have been assigned critical problems to solve,  
these product teams need to be skilled at  
product discovery  
,  
which is how you discover solutions worth building. You do that by  
assessing product risks before building anything, and then testing  
potential solutions in the fastest, least expensive ways you can.  
Moreover, in the product model, working hard and discovering and  
delivering lots of features is not enough. You need to  
solve problems  
for your customers, in ways that work for your business. This means  
delivering real product  
results  
.  
Once you believe you have identified a solution worth building, you  
need to build and deliver that solution to your customers. Doing this  
consistently, quickly, and reliably requires a set of skills referred to  
as  
product delivery  
. To truly take care of your customers—both in responding to their  
needs and consistently delivering new value—product teams need to  
be able to deliver  
frequent, small, reliable,  
and  
decoupled  
releases  
that are instrumented and monitored.  
Finally, an additional set of product model first principles  
contributes specifically to creating a strong  
product culture  
of  
consistent innovation.  
One final but important point to understand\: It takes a lot of work to  
establish this new product culture, but it takes very little to destroy  
it. You need to constantly remind yourself of the importance of the  
product model principles. There are always forces in a company that  
work to pull you off course. Protecting against this starts with  
constant awareness of these principles. CHAPTER 15  
# Product Teams  
The most fundamental of all product concepts is the notion of an  
empowered, cross-functional product team  
. This is where effective,  
innovative products come from, and most of the product model is  
one way or another about creating and nurturing these product  
teams.  
# Principle\:  
# Empowered with Problems to Solve  
First, let's look at what it means to be  
empowered  
.  
An empowered product team exists to  
solve problems  
in ways that y  
our customers love  
,  
yet work for your business  
.  
What makes the team empowered is that they are assigned  
problems  
to solve  
—they might be customer problems or company problems—  
and it is their job to come up with the best solution to those  
problems.  
It's important to recognize that this is very different from the feature  
teams that exist in the IT model, which are given prioritized lists of  
features and projects to build.  
Second, let's look at what it means to be  
cross-functional  
.  
A cross-functional product team has members who can cover each of  
the product model competencies necessary to come up with strong  
solutions to the problems you've been asked to solve.  
It is so critical for an empowered product team to be truly cross-  
functional because it is not reasonable to expect a team to solve  
problems and to be held accountable to the results without the range  
of necessary skills.  
Normally, that means a product manager, a product designer, and a  
set of engineers.  
We've said this earlier, but it's so essential it bears repeating\: The  
product manager  
is responsible for the value and  
viability risks and is overall accountable for the product's  
outcomes.  
The  
product designer  
is responsible for the usability risk and  
is overall accountable for the product's experience—every  
interaction your users and customers have with your product.  
The  
tech lead  
is responsible for the feasibility risk and is  
overall accountable for the product's delivery.  
Some people like to refer to this three-person subset of a product  
team as the  
product triad  
or  
troika  
.  
1  
It's normal that there are additional engineers on the product team  
as necessary, some with specific expertise, such as data science,  
mobile technology, or test automation/QA, and some who have a  
broad skill set able to work on many different technologies \(often  
referred to as a  
full-stack engineer  
\). Product Leaders and Empowered Teams  
An empowered, cross-functional product team is an incredibly  
powerful tool. Pick your favorite tech-powered product, and very  
likely there was an empowered product team behind it.  
But it's important to realize that this kind of product team doesn't  
happen on its own.  
In the product model, you depend on  
product leaders to coach  
the members of these product teams, and to provide them with  
the strategic context necessary for them to make good decisions  
.  
In this book, we use the term “product leaders” to represent the  
managers and leaders of product management, product design,  
and engineering.  
It's absolutely essential to understand that most people don't  
arrive at your company with the skills and knowledge they'll need  
to succeed as a member of an empowered product team.  
Even great people coming from strong product companies won't  
know your strategic context.  
So, it's the primary job of your product leaders to coach and  
develop the members of these product teams to get each person  
to the point where they are capable of doing the job they need to  
do.  
Strong managers and leaders also actively work to remove  
obstacles impacting their product teams.  
# Principle  
# \: Outcomes over Output  
At the end of the day, you know that unless the customer believes  
your new solution solves their problem sufficiently better than what  
they've been using, you fail.  
Shipping lots of features may make you feel good, but unless that  
translates into real business results, you fail. There are many variations on this same theme, including  
“accountable for business results” and “time to money over time to  
market.”  
They all speak to this principle that product teams exist to effectively  
solve problems for the customer and for your business, not just to  
build things that don't get bought or used.  
As an example of the different behaviors this principle can drive,  
sometimes a team looking hard at the data will find that the best way  
to improve outcomes is actually to  
remove  
functionality. This is most  
common on mobile apps, where the amount of real estate is very  
limited and where everything on the screen is essentially competing  
with everything else for the user's attention. A team focused on  
outcomes will at least consider this possibility.  
# Principle\:  
# Sense of Ownership  
If you want the product team to truly feel empowered and  
accountable, then you need them to feel a real sense of ownership  
over what they're responsible for.  
Let's look at the scope of responsibility of this product team. In other  
words,  
what is it that they own?  
The division of teams and their respective areas of ownership is the  
critical product leadership topic of  
team topology  
, but for now, you  
need each product team to be responsible for something  
meaningful  
.  
It may be a whole product, but more often today it is some  
meaningful subset of a much larger product. It is not unusual for a  
single product or service to have dozens or even hundreds of product  
teams working on different aspects or components of the larger  
product, as perceived by the end user.  
The product team needs to be responsible both for coming up with  
the solutions to the problems you've been asked to solve \(referred to  
as  
product discovery  
\) and building and delivering the solutions to  
your customers \(referred to as  
product delivery  
\).  
Separating these two responsibilities into two different teams breaks  
this principle and causes serious practical and cultural problems. It's therefore critical that this sense of ownership applies to everything  
that is done—including discovery and delivery, major innovation  
work and minor optimization work, fixing bugs, and scaling users.  
Note that this doesn't mean that every member of the product team  
spends equal time on discovery and delivery. In practice, product  
managers and product designers spend most of their day on product  
discovery work, and engineers spend most of their day on delivery  
work.  
# Principle\:  
# Collaboration  
Collaboration  
is one of those words that is used so often, and in so  
many different ways, that it has lost its meaning for many people.  
Of course, most people think they're collaborative.  
But in the context of an empowered, cross-functional product team,  
being collaborative has a very specific meaning, and it is most  
definitely  
not  
how most people—especially most product managers—  
are inclined to work.  
Too many product teams still follow the old waterfall process where a  
product manager defines requirements, hands them off to a designer  
to come up with a design that meets those requirements, and then  
hands that off—usually at sprint planning—to engineers who  
implement the requirements and design.  
To be very clear, this is most definitely  
not  
what we mean by  
collaboration.  
First, collaboration is  
not  
consensus. While you like it when the  
product team is in agreement on the best course of action, you do not  
insist on this. This is why you practice  
disagree and commit  
.  
Similarly, collaboration is  
not  
democracy. You don't vote on  
decisions. Instead, you depend on the expertise of each member of  
the product team.  
Generally speaking, if the decision pertains to the technology, you  
defer to the tech lead. If the decision pertains to the customer  
experience, you defer to the product designer. If the decision pertains to the business constraints, you defer to the product  
manager.  
Occasionally there will be conflicts, and normally you'll run a test to  
resolve them.  
Further, collaboration is  
not  
about artifacts. Many product managers  
think their job is to produce a document capturing “requirements,”  
or at the least, they are there to write user stories. It is true that you  
often need to create artifacts \(especially when team members are  
working remotely\), but that is certainly not how you collaborate. In  
fact, these artifacts more often get in the way of true collaboration.  
Why is that? Because once the product manager has claimed  
something is a “requirement,” that pretty much ends the  
conversation and moves the discussion to implementation.  
At this point, the product designer feels like she's there to ensure the  
design conforms to the company style guide, and the engineers feel  
like they are there just to code, and you're back to waterfall.  
Finally, collaboration is also  
not  
about compromise. If you end up  
with a mediocre user experience, slow performance and limited  
scalability, and dubious value for customers, you lose as a team.  
You need to find a solution that  
works  
. By that we mean that the  
solution is  
valuable  
\(valuable enough that target customers will  
actually buy it or choose to use it\), is  
usable  
\(so users can actually  
experience that value\), is  
feasible  
\(so you can actually deliver that  
value\) and is  
viable  
for your business \(so the rest of your company  
can effectively market, sell, and support the solution\).  
Accomplishing all this requires real collaboration.  
Remember that your job in product is to solve the problems you are  
asked to solve, in ways that your customers love yet that work for  
your business. That's your job as a cross-functional product team,  
and each member of the team is there because they bring specific and  
necessary skills.  
This all starts with true and intense collaboration between the  
product manager, the product designer, and the engineers. Our favorite way to do this is to sit around a prototype \(usually  
created by the product designer\) as a team to consider and discuss  
the proposed solution on the table\: The designer can consider  
different approaches to the experience; the engineers can consider  
implications of different approaches and the potential of different  
enabling technologies; and the product manager can consider the  
impacts and consequences of each potential direction \(e.g., would  
there be privacy violations, or would this be something that would  
work with your sales channel?\).  
Notice that none of the people on the product team are there to tell  
others how to do their jobs. Rather, in a healthy and competent  
team, each member of the team is counting on the others to bring the  
necessary skills to the table.  
But please don't misunderstand.  
Designers often have insights based on  
deep understanding of your  
users and their behaviors  
that lead you in a different direction in  
terms of the problem you're solving or your approach to the problem.  
These insights often will have big impact on value, and indirect  
impacts on things like performance.  
Similarly, strong engineers have  
deep insights into the enabling  
technology  
that often lead you to entirely different solutions to the  
problems you were assigned, often much better than anything the  
product manager, the designer, or especially the customer could have  
imagined.  
And likewise, the product manager has  
deep understanding of the  
customers and the business  
that may lead you to entirely different  
solutions.  
If we had to pick the one thing we love the most about the feeling of  
true collaboration on an empowered product team, it is the magic  
that happens when you have people who are motivated, and skilled  
in their respective discipline—product, design, and engineering—and  
they sit around a prototype or watch a user interact with the  
prototype, and the engineer points out new possibilities, and the  
designer points out different potential experiences, and the product  
manager weighs in with the sales- or financial- or privacy-related implications, and after exploring several approaches, together they  
find one method that truly solves for all concerned.  
Collaboration means product managers, product designers, and  
engineers working together to come up with a solution that solves for  
all your constraints—this is what we mean by solutions that our  
customers love, yet work for our business.  
Getting good at true collaboration is at the heart of how strong  
product teams work.  
# Note  
1  
While we don't mind the term “product triad,” we don't normally  
use it ourselves for two reasons\: First, sometimes the three core  
competencies are covered by two or four people, so it's not always  
three. Second, in our favorite product teams, all the engineers  
participate in discovery activities, not just the tech lead. CHAPTER 16  
# Product Strategy  
If you have an inspiring and meaningful product vision that you're all  
working toward achieving over the next several years, the product  
strategy is your path to making this product vision a reality.  
If product teams are all about solving hard problems, then product  
strategy is all about how you decide which problems are most  
important to solve.  
There are always many good opportunities you could pursue, and  
there are also many legitimate threats to your business.  
The question is\: How do you select the best opportunities, and how  
do you decide which are the most serious threats?  
# Principle\:  
# Focus  
As Steve Jobs said,  
“People think focus means saying yes to the  
thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It  
means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.  
You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we  
haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to  
1,000 things.”  
In stakeholder-driven models, it is inherently nearly impossible to  
have this necessary focus. That's because each stakeholder has their  
own goals and needs, and the company is simply trying to satisfy as  
many stakeholders as possible.  
In contrast, in the product model, you need to look holistically at  
both the opportunities and threats, and the product strategy is where  
you get serious about focus and making the biggest impact.  
It's important that the senior leaders of the company participate in  
the decisions on focus, and it's especially important that the product  
leaders are not perceived as having an agenda here. This is why it's  
so important for the product leaders to be transparent. It's also important to realize that it's often less about which  
particular goal is declared to be the most important, and more about  
that a declaration has been made at all. In most companies, there  
really are several excellent goals, and accomplishing even one of  
them can improve the company dramatically. But chasing too many  
of them very often results in none of them being successful.  
We often coach product leaders to encourage the CEO to select the  
two or three most important goals to pursue, and then the product  
leaders can focus on executing on those choices. The Power of an Inspiring Product Vision  
One very helpful technique for helping with focus is to create a  
product vision. The product vision describes the common, shared  
future you are trying to create.  
No matter how many product teams you might have, you want  
each team to know how they contribute to the greater whole.  
The product vision typically tries to describe a future between  
three and ten years out.  
Most important, the product vision describes how the world will  
be better from the point of view of  
your customers  
. The product  
strategy is from the point of view of your company, but the  
product vision is all about your customers.  
There are many significant benefits of a well-crafted product  
vision. It is very inspiring to the product organization, and often  
is your single best recruiting tool for new product talent. You can  
learn more about creating a strong, inspiring product vision in  
the book  
EMPOWERED  
.  
We mention the product vision here because it is very helpful for  
focus and prioritization. If the work or product idea in question  
does not take the company closer toward realizing its product  
vision, then you would question why this is a priority.  
There may still be reasons for pursuing it, but you would want to  
be conscious that this is a detour on the road toward the product  
vision.  
# Principle\:  
# Powered by Insights  
While it takes real  
discipline  
to focus, it takes real  
skill  
to identify the  
key insights that will power your product strategy.  
Insights provide the leverage points that show you how to  
concentrate your efforts. While these insights can come from  
anywhere, there are a few main sources\: Analyzing the data  
. Data about how your customers are using  
your products. Data about how your customers are buying your  
products. Data about how this is changing over time.  
Talking to your customers  
. Not asking them what they want  
you to build \(they don't know what is possible\) but asking them  
about what solutions they use today, about their environment  
and context, and what it would take to get them to switch to a  
new solution.  
New enabling technologies  
. What can your engineers solve  
today that you couldn't solve before? What new opportunities do  
the new technologies open up? What new experiences do the  
new technologies enable?  
The broader industry  
. What can you learn from the broader  
competitive landscape? What trends are impacting your  
industry or related industries? How are customer expectations  
changing over time?  
The product leaders are immersed in these insights, and the entire  
company should be encouraged to share any insights they might  
come across with these product leaders immediately.  
The product leaders are responsible for aggregating and analyzing  
these insights, but the insights can and do come from anywhere.  
# Principle\:  
# Transparency  
Remember that in the product model, deciding which problems to  
solve is effectively moved from being distributed across the various  
stakeholders to the product leaders. These product leaders look  
holistically at the business and work with the executives and  
stakeholders to come up with the most impactful product vision and  
product strategy, in order to pursue the most valuable opportunities  
and the most serious threats.  
It's easy to see how this might cause jealousy or frustration if the  
stakeholders worry that the product leaders are pursuing their own  
interests and agendas. This is why it's so important for the product  
leaders to be open and transparent on the data and reasoning they  
are using to make these product strategy decisions. It also should be clear that the product leaders will need to work  
hard to gain buy-in for their product strategy from the different  
impacted stakeholders across the company, especially since  
executing on any product strategy typically entails cooperation from  
across the company. \(You'll see multiple examples of this in the case  
studies in this book.\)  
Remember that a product strategy will be effective only if you can  
execute that strategy.  
There is no formula for an effective product strategy. Such a strategy  
requires immersing in the insights, the data, the customers, the  
technology, and the industry trends and learnings; assimilating as  
much of the relevant information as possible; and then thinking  
through the various options.  
This is often referred to as  
product sense  
, but it's really the result of  
spending all this time immersed in the details.  
The benefit of this analysis and transparency is that the rationale for  
the choices is clear, and the organization is aligned, all of which  
enable the organization to execute on this product strategy much  
more quickly and effectively.  
# Principle\:  
# Placing Bets  
Finally, it's important for everyone to realize that product strategy is  
not a science.  
Even with the best product strategy, and with very skilled product  
teams and product leaders, you should expect that not every product  
team will solve every product problem like clockwork every quarter.  
Realize that every product team is composed of people with different  
skill sets, working on different problems, with different technologies,  
and especially with access to different data.  
Further, some problems are simply much harder than others. Some  
problems have a much different risk profile than others. And some  
problems have much tougher goals to achieve.  
The mistake made in the IT model is to ignore this reality, and then  
act surprised when projects end up taking far longer than expected or fail to deliver any meaningful results.  
In the product model, you accept this as a reality of technology-  
powered products, and you plan for these eventualities.  
One useful metaphor for dealing with this reality is the notion of  
placing multiple bets. In other words, if you have a critically  
important problem to solve, you might assign that problem to  
multiple product teams in the hope that at least one of them will  
make substantial progress in the quarter.  
If you get lucky, and multiple teams make substantial progress—  
sometimes even more than you hoped—that would be an  
exceptionally good outcome, but it is not a likely outcome.  
Experienced product leaders will manage the portfolio of risks by  
placing a series of bets each quarter, working to maximize the  
likelihood of meeting the company's annual business objectives by  
the end of the year. CHAPTER 17  
# Product Discovery  
Product teams are responsible for both figuring out the best solution  
to the problems they've been asked to solve, and then building and  
delivering those solutions.  
The former is  
product discovery,  
and the latter is  
product delivery  
.  
# Principle\:  
# Minimize Waste  
The first principle in product discovery is to try to solve the problem  
with a minimum amount of wasted time and effort. This is why  
product discovery is the key to accelerated time to money.  
The product team could certainly just take their best guess at a  
solution, describe that solution to the engineers, and then have them  
build and deliver that solution.  
This is essentially what has been done for decades by so many  
companies in the IT model.  
But we also have decades of data clearly showing that the majority of  
solutions built that way \(generally 70 to 90 percent\) end up  
not  
delivering the necessary business results.  
This is wasteful not only from a direct cost perspective \(especially  
because the largest cost is usually the engineers\), but also from an  
opportunity cost perspective.  
Every once in a while, the team gets to take a second shot, but even  
then, the odds are against success with that way of working.  
The concept of product discovery emerged because smart companies  
saw the waste in working this way. They wanted to ensure that they  
had  
sufficient evidence  
to believe that the solution they asked their  
engineers to build would successfully solve the customer or business  
problem it was intended to solve. The key idea behind product discovery is to test out product ideas  
very quickly to identify a solution worth building, and then to get  
that solution to market. The intention is both much faster time to  
money and much better business results, through dramatically less  
waste.  
# Principle\:  
# Assess Product Risks  
There are always risks in building products\:  
Value risk  
—You might build the product only to find that your  
customers don't feel it's sufficiently better than what they  
currently have, and they're not willing to buy it or choose to use  
it and switch.  
Usability risk  
—You might build the product only to find that  
your users can't figure out how to do what they need to, or are  
otherwise not aligned to how they think about the problem  
because the product is too confusing, or not behaving as they  
would expect, or the learning curve is too steep.  
Viability risk  
—You might build the product only to find that  
there are legal, compliance, partnership, or ethical issues you  
hadn't realized that prevent you from selling this product. You  
might build the product only to find that your marketing and  
sales organizations aren't aligned with what this product needs  
to get into the hands of customers. You might build the product  
only to find that operational costs are too high and/or you can't  
generate sufficient revenue to sustain this business.  
Feasibility risk  
—You might find it takes so much longer to build  
than you had originally thought that your costs become so high  
you can't afford to actually build and deliver this product.  
Some problems you're working on have very minor risks, and others  
have several very major risks. But every effort has risks you need to  
consider.  
Most important, the key principle here is that you need to assess and  
address these risks  
before you decide to build anything  
. Assessing Ethical Risk  
Ethical risk is part of business viability risk, along with other  
important risks such as go-to-market risk and monetization risk.  
But unlike the other risks, ethical risk rarely has a dedicated  
stakeholder in the company. Occasionally you will find a Chief  
Ethics Officer, but today this is the exception rather than the rule.  
You might be wondering why the product team should concern  
itself with ethical risk. The reason is because often the product  
team is the first to realize during product discovery that there  
may be environmental, social, or safety-related consequences of  
the work.  
Most of the time, these consequences are not in any way  
intentional, but nevertheless they may cause externalities or  
other effects. If you can identify and predict these effects, you can  
seek alternative approaches without these problematic side  
effects.  
In these cases, often product leaders must get personally involved  
to help resolve the issue. It is also common for product leaders to  
coach their people on how to identify and work through ethics  
issues.  
# Principle\:  
# Embrace Rapid Experimentation  
Taking these product risks seriously requires that you're honest with  
yourself about what you can't possibly know without some  
investigation, and also what things your customers and your  
stakeholders can't know \(usually because they don't know what's  
technically possible\).  
Without creating a prototype and running some experiments, it's  
very difficult to know if customers would really be able to learn and  
use a new product, or whether they actually would buy this new  
product. Without the engineers having some time to investigate the  
underlying technology and the potential solution, it's very difficult  
for them to know how long something might really take to build.  
The heart of product discovery is rapidly testing product ideas for  
what the solution could be.  
You  
think  
you understand the solution that will solve your  
customer's problem, but you are aware and humble enough to know  
it's just a guess. So, you create an experiment designed to quickly  
determine if this approach will or will not work.  
An experimentation culture not only helps you address risks, but it is  
absolutely central to innovation. Often the idea that succeeds started  
out looking like an idea that had little chance.  
A culture of rapid experimentation encourages product teams to  
pursue these ideas. Skills in experimentation enable the product  
teams to test these ideas quickly and inexpensively.  
More generally, in the product model, it's normal for people to  
disagree.  
In fact, if members of the product team and the stakeholders they  
collaborate with actually care about what they're doing,  
disagreements are a good sign.  
But that also means there will be lots of disagreements. For that  
reason, product teams need to be skilled in the many discovery  
techniques used to run quick tests to collect some data so that you  
can make an informed decision. And they must develop the  
judgment to know how much data they need to collect for the  
particular situation.  
This means they need to be skilled at both quantitative and  
qualitative discovery techniques. The quantitative techniques let you  
learn  
how  
your users and customers actually engage with your  
product ideas, which is a tremendous asset. However, the big  
limitation is that this data generally can't tell you  
why  
customers are  
using \(or, very often,  
not  
using\) your product ideas. For this reason,  
you also need qualitative techniques, the most important of which is  
actually talking to your users and customers. A corollary of this is that everything you build and deploy needs to be  
instrumented such that you know how your products actually are  
being used. Without this data, you are flying blind.  
With this data, you can improve the product even faster, and also  
quickly diagnose issues that may arise.  
# Principle\:  
# Test Ideas Responsibly  
Product discovery techniques are used in companies of every size,  
from the smallest startups to the largest enterprises. But there are  
some differences. Some things are easier at a startup and other  
things are harder.  
Startups often don't have much traffic, which hinders their ability to  
collect a sufficient volume of data.  
On the other hand, large, established companies usually have many  
customers. Assuming the company has instrumented its products  
and is collecting this data, this can be an advantage. However, as  
discussed earlier, if the company is not yet collecting this data, this is  
at the foundation of  
changing how you build  
.  
Another difference is that startups usually don't have much revenue  
and don't have many customers. Until they correct that, there's very  
little for them to lose. But in a larger enterprise, you have a great deal  
to lose.  
That is why one of the principles of product discovery in established  
companies is the need to assess the risks, run your experiments,  
collect your data, and iterate quickly—all while ensuring you are  
protecting\:  
The company's revenue  
The company's reputation  
The company's customers \(from being confused or frustrated\)  
Your colleagues \(e.g., sales or customer success\) \(from being  
blindsided\) For techniques where any of these are a concern, variations exist that  
you can use when you need to be more conservative in your testing.  
To be clear, you absolutely need to run the experiments, but you  
need to do so responsibly. CHAPTER 18  
# Product Delivery  
Most companies moving to the product model not only have to  
introduce the tech lead competency we discussed earlier, but they  
also have to upgrade their skills and infrastructure when it comes to  
building, testing, and deploying the products that their customers  
depend on.  
In strong product companies, you'll often hear the phrase  
“Reliability is our most important feature.”  
In modern technology-powered products and services, breaking the  
product can have immediate and damaging consequences to your  
users and customers, your revenue, your brand's reputation, and  
your colleagues \(especially sales and customer success staff\).  
If you cause a serious issue, it can create an outage for all the  
customers and users who use and depend on that service. This is part  
of the price we pay for the many benefits of cloud computing.  
With every product, there will be times where your customers  
encounter some serious problem requiring immediate action.  
In these cases, you need the ability to immediately roll back the last  
change to stabilize the system, quickly diagnose the issue, create a  
solution, test that solution to ensure it solves the problem and  
doesn't  
inadvertently cause other issues \(regressions\), and then  
safely deploy that solution.  
Customers generally understand that occasionally problems will  
occur, but they judge you more by your ability to respond quickly and  
competently when those issues do arise.  
Waiting weeks or months is simply no longer acceptable for most  
companies today. Strong product companies need the ability to  
respond quickly and competently to pressing customer or market  
needs. To serve your customers, you need to ensure your products are  
working properly and generating the necessary value. This is what  
drives the need for a set of critical capabilities to support  
deployment, instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics.  
While the concepts and principles in this chapter are somewhat  
technical in nature, they are all essential and, at the conceptual level,  
fairly straightforward to understand.  
# Principle\:  
# Small, Frequent, Uncoupled Releases  
The core principle that is used to address these needs is the  
deployment of  
small, frequent, uncoupled releases  
.  
This means,  
at a minimum  
, each product team releases their new  
work no less than every other week. For strong product companies,  
this means releasing  
several times per day  
\(referred to as CI/CD—  
continuous integration, continuous deployment\).  
1  
The reason you likely don't know this is happening with your favorite  
products is precisely  
because  
they are releasing a near-constant  
stream of very small releases.  
But ensuring reliability is somewhat more complicated than it may  
seem. In general, you work to test two main aspects of what you  
build—the first is straightforward and the second is less so.  
The first is that when you build a new capability, you need to test  
that the new capability will work as expected. Straightforward,  
although since you likely will want to test and retest this new  
capability thousands of times in the coming months and years, you  
will usually invest in some level of test automation.  
The second is to ensure that the changes made to enable the new  
capability do not unintentionally or inadvertently break anything  
else. This is referred to as  
regression testing  
. And when you realize  
that many technology-powered products and services today are the  
result of literally hundreds of engineers working for many years,  
creating tens of thousands of interactions, you can see that ensuring  
a complex product does not take a step backward when a new  
capability is introduced can be a significant undertaking. The main method product teams use to ensure that new capabilities  
work as advertised, and don't introduce regressions, is to deploy a  
series of very small changes.  
The smaller the release increment, the faster you can ensure the  
quality of the new capability, and the faster you can be confident  
you're not introducing regressions.  
And with these small, frequent releases, if a problem is introduced, it  
is much easier to identify the cause \(since you only changed a small  
number of things\).  
So, if you are serious about taking care of your customers, you will  
need to invest in your ability to deliver very frequent, very small  
releases.  
If this seems counterintuitive to you, and if you still believe that to  
ensure quality you need to release slowly and infrequently, then you  
owe it to yourself, your company, and especially your customers to  
examine the theory and the evidence on why frequent, smaller  
releases provide both more throughput \(higher velocity\)  
and  
higher  
quality at strong product companies.  
2  
Unfortunately, many companies have not yet achieved the ability to  
do these small, frequent releases.  
Instead, they make hundreds or even thousands of changes, and  
then, once a month, once a quarter, or even once a year, they will  
work to integrate all these changes together. They then try to test  
that all these new capabilities work as expected, and then they begin  
the grind of trying to identify and remove all the newly introduced  
problems \(regressions\).  
As we hope you are beginning to realize, this is why large releases  
\(known as  
big-bang releases  
\) are notorious for delays of weeks or  
even months, trying to get everything back to a reliable, releasable  
state.  
In fact, many products built this way  
never  
achieve a state of solid  
quality, and the customer is forced to deal with a constant stream of  
defects and issues, or else seek out a different solution provider.  
Moreover, even if the new release actually works as it's supposed to  
\(a very big  
if  
\), customers are forced to absorb hundreds or even thousands of product changes hitting them all at once. This likely  
requires retraining, recertification, reintegration, and otherwise  
significantly interrupts their own work to accommodate all the  
changes the company has forced upon them.  
In this case, it's common for customers to press your company to  
release  
less frequently  
, because they simply have no time to deal  
with this degree of change. As you can see by now, while it is  
completely understandable why customers would request fewer  
releases, doing so actually would be  
worse  
for the customer and  
worse  
for your company.  
However, rather than ignore or discount customers’ legitimate  
concerns, the responsibility is on you to design, test, and release your  
work so that customers do not have to deal with the impact of the  
changes. And while you have good reason to get your changes into  
the production environment as quickly as possible, you also have  
techniques to control when customers can see and access these new  
capabilities, which we'll describe in the principles that follow. High-Integrity Commitments  
In the product model, product teams are all about solving hard  
problems for your customers and your company, in ways that  
your customers love, yet work for the business.  
That said, the product model also realizes that sometimes you  
need to deliver a specific deliverable on a specific date. These are  
called  
high-integrity commitments  
.  
Perhaps there's a partnership involved, and the partner must be  
able to plan their work from their side. Or perhaps your company  
is planning a major marketing campaign or industry event, and  
so you need to commit to being ready.  
It is no secret that typical Agile teams have a terrible track record  
in terms of delivering on these types of promises.  
But strong product companies know how important this is to  
building and maintaining trust with customers, partners, and the  
rest of your company.  
If your customers or partners are depending on you for a specific  
deliverable, they need to know they can count on you to deliver  
when promised, and that the deliverable will provide the  
necessary value.  
In this case, you want both to solve the underlying problem and  
to determine with high confidence when you can commit to a  
deliverable on a specific date.  
Here's the key\: So long as the product team responsible for  
making the high-integrity commitments is first allowed to do  
sufficient product discovery, such that they can reasonably  
address the product risks, then they can safely and responsibly  
commit to a deliverable on a date.  
If the engineers are experienced or have competent coaching, this  
almost always means the product team will first create a  
feasibility prototype  
before they commit to anything. This  
popular technique is described in the book  
INSPIRED  
. Further, it's absolutely essential that  
the people who provide the  
dates are the ones who will actually have to deliver the product  
.  
These dates  
should  
never  
come from project or program  
managers, product managers, architects, or anyone other than  
the people who will have to do the actual work.  
Moreover, since the CTO \(head of engineering\) is ultimately  
responsible for the commitments made by her engineering  
organization, best practice is that she should personally approve  
all high-integrity commitments.  
It's worth emphasizing that high-integrity commitments, when  
used appropriately and judiciously by the company's senior  
leadership  
3  

and when handled professionally by the product  
team, can go a long way in building the necessary trust across the  
organization.  
# Principle\:  
# Instrumentation  
Because in the product model you are committing to solving  
problems and are held accountable to achieving outcomes, it is  
essential that you understand how \(or even if\) your products actually  
are used.  
This means that you need to ensure your products are  
instrumented  
such that you are able to understand what is going on. This is  
referred to as  
telemetry  
, and it happens at all levels—from low-level  
services reporting on their health and performance, to high-level  
applications generating usage analytics and company dashboards.  
Without this instrumentation, you are simply flying blind.  
You can release a new capability and have little idea if and how it is  
being used, and where your customers might be struggling. With  
good instrumentation and analytics, you can quickly detect and  
correct problems, and demonstrate that you are providing the  
necessary value.  
Many different tools and services are available to your engineers to  
provide the necessary level of instrumentation. It is normal to need multiple tools because of the different types and levels of  
instrumentation, but it is critical to understand the importance of  
this telemetry data.  
It is also important to recognize that the specific telemetry data you  
collect is always evolving as you get a deeper understanding of how  
your products are used, and the improvements you need to drive.  
This is something that is never “done,” but rather is constantly  
improving.  
# Principle\:  
# Monitoring  
There are many benefits to the instrumentation described in the  
preceding principle, but one of the most important is that  
instrumentation enables another delivery principle\:  
monitoring  
,  
also known as  
observability  
.  
As with instrumentation, monitoring happens at all levels—from  
ensuring that the underlying computing systems and services are  
operating and performing properly, all the way up to ensuring that  
your application is behaving correctly and serving customers  
appropriately.  
With strong monitoring, you can very quickly detect issues, often  
before your customers ever encounter a problem.  
As with instrumentation, a wide range of commercial tools are  
available to help with monitoring. And as with instrumentation, you  
can expect your company to need multiple monitoring and reporting  
tools for the different types and levels of information.  
For both instrumentation and monitoring, the tools use techniques  
to prevent tracking or reporting any sensitive or personally  
identifiable information.  
# Principle\:  
# Deployment Infrastructure  
So far, you have the ability to deploy small, frequent releases that are  
instrumented to provide the necessary telemetry data, and you are  
monitoring the status of these releases. But to ensure you are providing the necessary value, there is one  
more important element, which involves the infrastructure used for  
deployment.  
Suppose you have a new capability that is ready to be released into  
production. Even assuming you have tested that new capability and  
ensured that it works properly, occasionally you will find that in the  
production environment, there is some sort of problem, and the  
deployment infrastructure needs the ability to roll back that change  
when required.  
But even if things are operating fine, what you don't yet know is how  
this actually will be utilized by your customers in their daily use.  
There are three possible outcomes here\:  
1\. Customers love this new capability, and they immediately start  
using and depending on it. This, of course, is what you hope for.  
2\. Once it's released into production, this new capability for some  
reason actually  
hurts  
your customers’ ability to use your  
products. One common reason for this, especially with mobile  
applications, is that due to the very limited amount of real estate  
on their device, sometimes when you add a capability, customers  
can no longer find a more important capability. In this case, you  
would not want to deploy this capability until and unless you  
could correct this problem.  
3\. The new feature is deployed and technically works fine, but it's  
simply not used, at least not to the level you had hoped for or  
expected. The result is that the new capability does not hurt or  
help anything. This case is actually surprisingly common and  
very frustrating.  
If you are to hold yourself to a standard of achieving business  
outcomes, then you need to deploy new capabilities such that you  
know which one of these three cases is happening.  
The most common way of doing this is to have your deployment  
infrastructure support A/B testing. This is considered the “gold  
standard” because you can easily isolate the contribution of just a single new capability. However, this also depends on significant  
levels of traffic to determine results quickly.  
You may not be aware of this, but companies operating in the  
product model are running many \(often hundreds or more\) of these  
tests  
simultaneously  
. The deployment infrastructure runs these  
various  
tests, collects the analytics for each test, and continues until  
there are statistically significant results.  
Other deployment infrastructure capabilities enable you to control  
which of your customers are able to see specific new capabilities. One  
especially popular capability allows you to deploy new capabilities  
into production, but to keep that new capability hidden from your  
customers until such time as you are ready. This technique is  
especially helpful when you have a combination of changes that need  
to be made visible simultaneously or when you want to wait to show  
it at a special marketing event.  
In terms of deployment infrastructure, although several commercial  
tools are available, companies have a range of needs, and it is not  
unusual for companies to have a blend of commercial and custom  
infrastructure. Managing Technical Debt  
We mention the tech debt problem here because if the situation is  
severe enough, this will get in the way of everything else, starting  
with changing how you build and deploy.  
Every company has technical debt,  
4  

but a disproportionate  
number of companies that want to transform have very serious  
level of tech debt.  
There are two common reasons for this\:  
1\. Companies that have a history of acquisitions not only  
inherit the debt of the companies they acquire, but between  
the need to integrate with other systems and the  
postacquisition loss of experienced engineers, the problems  
usually multiply.  
2\. In most of the prior models, especially those run under the  
classic IT-style project-based funding model, this is a recipe  
for creating very high levels of technical debt quickly, as  
funding is only for the particular project, and usually does  
not include looking holistically at the systems to constantly  
improve products and the systems that run them.  
No matter the cause, the symptoms of tech debt are usually quite  
clear. Work that used to take days or weeks now takes months.  
Product teams complain of too many dependencies and too little  
autonomy. Even small capabilities become expensive, and the  
large initiatives that are so important to companies become so  
difficult that the company tries everything possible to avoid them.  
This is why technical debt is so feared across so many companies.  
It is one of the few true business-continuity risks that companies  
face.  
Moving to the product model where product teams have real  
ownership of major areas is a big step toward improving the  
situation, but you still will need to dig yourself out of the hole. The specifics of different replatforming efforts are well beyond  
the scope of this book, but specialty firms can help you formulate  
a solid plan to modernize your code base, if needed. However, the  
most important thing to realize is that you need to start on this  
work on addressing tech debt immediately, and then do this work  
continuously, indefinitely.  
Most companies with a good handle on tech debt will tell you that  
they work on tech debt every day, with about 10 to 30 percent of  
the engineering capacity. Sometimes, the situation is so dire that  
it demands more like 40 to 60 percent of the engineering  
capacity. At this point, you have very little remaining capacity for  
your customers, so you would need to proceed carefully and  
intentionally.  
While getting this tech debt issue under control usually will take  
one to three years, the good news is that if you have a solid plan  
and experienced engineers, you often will begin to see real results  
in just a few months.  
# Notes  
1  
2  
3  
The most common objection to this comes from product teams  
building native mobile applications, where they point out that app  
stores don't like when you submit new versions of your app more  
than once a month or so. But we have tools for several years that  
allow us to release continuously to a controlled set of customer  
devices so that we get the benefits of continuous deployment.  
We recommend the excellent book  
Accelerate\: The Science of  
Lean Software and DevOps\: Building and Scaling High  
Performing Technology Organizations  
by Nicole Forsgren, Jez  
Humble, and Gene Kim \(IT Revolution Press, 2018\).  
It's also important to acknowledge that some companies try to  
make everything a high-integrity commitment, which completely  
misses the point, and actually undermines the product model. 4  
Likely you have heard of the concept of  
technical debt  
, but it is  
the cumulative impact of years’ worth of both growth as well as  
engineering and architectural shortcuts in the name of  
expediency. To be clear, this is normal and, to a degree, even  
desirable, but if left unaddressed, tech debt can literally destroy  
companies. The most common symptom of this problem getting  
out of hand is when work that would normally take days starts  
taking weeks, and you hear the frustration this causes across your  
company and your customers. CHAPTER 19  
# Product Culture  
We've been discussing the product core concepts of product teams,  
product strategy, product discovery, and product delivery, but if you  
consider all the core principles behind each of those concepts, you  
can get a good sense of what is meant by a strong product culture at a  
strong product company\:  
Product teams  
empowered to figure out good solutions to hard  
problems, staffed with the cross-functional set of skills necessary and  
provided unencumbered access to customers, data, and stakeholders.  
Product strategy  
powered by insights that help the organization  
decide the most valuable opportunities to pursue and the most  
serious threats to counter.  
Product teams skilled at  
product discovery  
by assessing risks up  
front, embracing experimentation, prototyping, and rapid testing  
with users and customers to quickly determine which solutions  
actually are worth building.  
And once product teams decide to build, they have the  
product  
delivery skills  
to build, test, and deploy via small, frequent, reliable  
releases that are instrumented and monitored.  
There are, however, a few other critically important product model  
principles can be thought of as meta-principles, as they apply to  
product development more generally yet play a very important role  
in defining a strong product culture.  
# Principle\:  
# Principles over Process  
Many companies that want to transform were, in their earlier years,  
quite good at innovation, but then somehow, they lost this ability.  
Unfortunately, this is all too common, and it is something that strong  
product companies are always fearful will happen to them. As Jeff Bezos warns\:  
“Good process serves you so you can serve  
customers. But if you're not watchful, the process can become the  
thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations…The  
process is not the thing. It's always worth asking, do we own the  
process or does the process own us?”  
Or as Steve Jobs warns\:  
“That's what makes great products. It's not  
process; it's content…The system is that there is no system. That  
doesn't mean we don't have process…But that's not what it's about.”  
Or as Reed Hastings warns\:  
“\[The reason Netflix has been so  
successful is because it has\] a culture that values people over  
process, emphasizes innovation over efficiency, and has very few  
controls.”  
Or as Steve Blank warns\:  
“Process is great when you live in a world  
where both the problem and solution are known. Process helps  
ensure that you can deliver solutions that scale without breaking  
other parts of the organization…These processes reduce risk to an  
overall organization, but each layer of process reduces the ability to  
be agile and lean and—most important—be responsive to new  
opportunities and threats.”  
It's not that process is inherently bad, but many leaders and  
managers will join your company from companies that long ago lost  
their ability to innovate, and they bring with them the processes and  
culture that they came from. Or, they bring processes from the  
nontechnology space and try to impose them on organizations trying  
to optimize for innovation.  
Fundamentally, you can try to run your product organization with  
process or with people.  
If a person makes a mistake, you can either add a process that is  
intended to prevent that mistake from happening again, or you can  
provide some coaching so the person understands how they might  
better handle the situation going forward.  
If you're trying to empower your people with a true sense of  
ownership and push decisions down to the product teams and closer  
to the users, then you'll need to make coaching a pillar of what your  
managers are responsible for. Coaching includes teaching skills and principles, and also sharing the  
strategic context—the larger picture of the product vision and  
product strategy.  
Continuous Process Improvement  
Another way of ensuring that the principles we're discussing here  
are always more important than any particular process you follow  
is to intentionally practice  
continuous process improvement  
.  
The idea is to always reflect on your experiences and your needs,  
and constantly strive to get better. This means being careful you  
don't fall into the trap of becoming religious about process.  
# Principle\:  
# Trust over Control  
Moving from the command-and-control model to the product model  
is not only a change in competencies and concepts, but it represents  
a fundamental cultural change.  
For many company leaders, especially those who built their careers  
on the top-down, command-and-control model, this is a big leap. It  
is a model that depends on trust rather than control.  
It can be helpful to realize that this is what's really going on  
underneath this very different way of working.  
This approach shows up in many ways, starting with moving from  
stakeholders providing product teams with prioritized lists of  
features  
and projects, to instead empowering the product teams by  
giving them problems to solve and allowing them to take  
responsibility for coming up with the best solutions to those  
problems.  
More generally, this means moving from hands-on  
micromanagement to servant-based leadership with active coaching.  
It means leading with context rather than control. Principle\:  
# Innovation over Predictability  
In many companies, the root cause of their lack of innovation is quite  
plain to see. They have designed their organization and how they  
work around the goal of predictability. They simply focus on being  
able to ship large numbers of features every quarter.  
It's not that they are intentionally abandoning the goal of innovation,  
but as Henrik Kniberg says,  
“100% predictability = 0% innovation.”  
Companies that focus on predictability will tell you that it's the  
stakeholders’ job to worry about whether the features shipped are  
valuable or not. But strong product companies know this is not a  
question of smart stakeholders. It goes to the nature of technology-  
powered products, and especially that stakeholders and customers  
don't know what's possible. It is the engineers who know what is just  
now possible.  
Today, more than ever, companies depend on continuous  
innovation. So, recognize that predictability is good but not as  
important or necessary as innovation.  
The best way to handle the need for occasional predictability of a  
deliverable is with  
high-integrity commitments  
. From Projects to Products  
Talking about product culture can sound very theoretical, but it  
impacts everyone every day. To try to bring these principles to  
life, here is an example of a very common before and after.  
In the old models, it is very common that everything is about  
building  
projects  
by certain  
dates  
.  
It's understandable where this comes from, as the IT department  
is constantly asked for specific features and projects delivered as  
fast as possible.  
The problem is that this ignores the realities of technology-  
powered products.  
Projects  
are typically large, slow, and expensive attempts to  
deliver some output by a specific date. You have to decide how  
big the team needs to be, and guess how much time the project  
will take. And then you need to try to get funding for the effort,  
and invariably you learn that there is more work required than  
you first expected, so there's a real crunch to finish.  
Most efforts lose all hope of providing real value and just try to  
get something shipped. Then as soon as they do finally ship, they  
can't iterate to improve the product because the people usually  
scatter off to their next assignments. Nobody owns the outcome,  
and any important learnings from the effort likely are lost.  
There are so many things wrong with this\:  
1\. It normally takes several iterations, based on learning from  
prior iterations, until you achieve the necessary results, but  
you rarely get funding for more than the first attempt. Even  
if you do, it's usually multiple quarters later.  
2\. You need the people to feel real ownership of the technology  
and the outcomes, but when people are assigned to an area  
just for the duration of the project, there is very little  
ownership, and there's little incentive for them to build  
something impactful. 3\. It's all about delivering the features and projects that the  
stakeholders are asking for, rather than allowing your  
product team, especially the engineers, to look at what's just  
now possible. The result is that any form of innovation is  
exceptionally rare with projects.  
4\. Because teams build just what they need to for that project,  
there's no one to worry about the longer-term impact of this  
work,  
or improving the underlying technology, so tech debt  
rapidly accumulates.  
5\. Who takes responsibility for driving to the necessary  
outcome? Any sense of ownership usually is dispersed  
among multiple stakeholders, and the most likely  
consequence is to blame the project team for doing such a  
poor job.  
In contrast, with the product model, you focus on  
products  
and  
outcomes  
.  
A product team focuses on business outcomes, like reducing  
churn rates, or improving growth, or whatever the relevant KPIs  
are for your situation, and the product team is constantly working  
to monitor and improve those results. The capabilities they add  
are all intended to drive those results. They are obsessing over the  
outcome.  
In part, this is about changing to durable product teams focused  
on business results, but, in part, this is a cultural change where a  
team is asked to be accountable to  
outcomes  
and not just  
shipping features.  
In the project model, the best you can really ask for is time to  
market. But in the product model, you can focus on the much  
more impactful  
time to money  
.  
What is especially ironic is you might think that a time-to-market  
project  
at least would get done  
faster  
than a time-to-money  
product  
team would achieve an outcome. But so often it is just  
the opposite.  
While the project team must staff up, learn the necessary  
technology, establish the necessary relationships, and understand the necessary context, a product team is already operational and  
likely has done many similar projects and features already. So, in  
addition to being up to speed on the technology, they know much  
more about both the problem and solution space, they know the  
data, and they know how to work as a team to tackle a problem.  
This is why, far and away, the most waste we see is in companies  
running in the old project model.  
None of this is to say that time to market isn't important. It is.  
And speed matters. And there are solid techniques when a date  
you can count on is the priority.  
That said, the heart of the matter is the question\: What is more  
important for this effort\: hitting this date or accomplishing this  
outcome? Sometimes the date  
is  
the priority. But this should be  
the exception and not the rule.  
It's easy to see why so many companies may talk about the  
importance of outcomes over output, yet their culture and  
behaviors consistently prioritize predictability over results.  
# Principle\:  
# Learning over Failure  
In many companies, there is a deeply rooted fear of failure. This fear  
drives people and processes to become risk averse, and unable to  
respond to the changing needs of the market and the new enabling  
technologies.  
While it's never our intention to glamorize failure, the focus must be  
on tackling risks and learning quickly. When you run an experiment  
in product discovery, there is no such concept as  
success  
or  
failure  
;  
there is only the question “What have we learned?”  
Your goal is to learn what works and what doesn't in product  
discovery, where costs and time are dramatically reduced, and risk is  
mitigated. This is so when you do move forward with the time and  
expense of actually building products, you have evidence and  
confidence the product won't be a failure. Yet it's also true that with some product efforts, you still may fail. A  
strong product culture understands that risk, and embraces the  
learning and the people who were willing to take the risk. CHAPTER 20  
# Innovation Story\: Carmax  
Marty's Note\: CarMax had already been seeing the benefits of their  
transformation to the product model when the pandemic put the  
organization to a true test. It required the company to use all its  
new muscles—product strategy, product discovery, and product  
delivery. Sometimes it takes a crisis to see what an organization is  
truly capable of  
.  
# Company Background  
CarMax, founded in 1993 and based in Richmond, Virginia, is the  
largest retailer of used cars in the United States. The company has  
built a strong business over the past 30 years by bringing trust and  
integrity to buying and selling used cars.  
CarMax was initially created as a spin-off of electronics retailer  
Circuit City and quickly grew to become a leader in used car sales.  
Over time, the company's leaders saw consumer expectations  
beginning to change, especially around the desire for an online  
shopping and buying experience, as well as the emergence of digital-  
native competitors, and  
they realized that they would need to disrupt  
themselves to maintain their leadership position.  
The company's initial efforts in moving to the product model were  
focused on the consumer-facing digital experience, which was led by  
Ann Yauger. Ann instigated and led the initial transformation to the  
product model with the  
carmax.com  
team. The initiative quickly  
proved its value—starting several years of organizational growth to  
build out product competencies at scale.  
By the start of 2020, the company had more than 200 CarMax  
stores, each with hundreds of used cars for sale on its lots. The  
company was consistently profitable and growing.  
The transformation had already produced tangible results, and  
CarMax built a reputation for innovation in the retail car space. Consumers could research available cars online, discover what cars  
they could afford, and make an appointment to visit a store to test  
drive specific cars.  
Unlike most car purchase experiences, at CarMax, there was a  
simple, no-haggle price for each car they would buy or sell, and each  
car CarMax chose to recondition for retail had to pass an extensive  
125-point inspection, with high standards for quality.  
Cars that made the grade were available for sale to CarMax  
customers, along with a 7-day money-back guarantee and a 30-day  
warranty.  
Cars that did not pass this level of quality were sold via auctions to  
other dealers.  
# The Problem to Solve  
When the pandemic hit, many brick-and-mortar retailers—including  
CarMax—needed to comply with a variety of state and local  
restrictions and mandates. This included in some cases closing  
stores, reducing the number of customers allowed in the store at the  
same time, or only selling vehicles outside.  
With these new restrictions and the broad macroeconomic impact  
from the pandemic, the company shared that by early April 2020,  
sales were down more than 75 percent versus the previous year.  
Yet, in addition to the challenges other physical retailers faced,  
CarMax held billions of dollars’ worth of inventory—cars sitting on  
lots—but with real limitations on how the cars could be sold.  
Fortunately, CarMax had already begun to move to an omnichannel  
retail experience, where customers could purchase either online or in  
a store, or via their desired blend. But now this was no longer a  
business growth opportunity; it instead became business critical.  
The company needed to accelerate its move to omnichannel retail  
and discover additional ways to sell its tremendous inventory of cars  
within the constraints of the pandemic.  
Discovering the Solution At this point, CarMax had several strong product teams, many that  
had already been working on areas related to the omnichannel  
capabilities that were now the priority.  
The most obvious changes had to do with moving to an experience  
that was not dependent on visiting retail stores and interacting live  
with in-store sales associates.  
The company accelerated its move to a virtual customer experience  
center, staffed with associates who could provide assistance at any  
stage of the car-buying or car-selling process.  
The company also needed to offer a way not only to browse cars  
online, but also to select a car, finance or pay for it, complete the  
sales order, and arrange delivery or pickup. And if a trade-in was  
involved, an online way to get an actionable and immediate trade-in  
value for that car was needed.  
Further, CarMax could no longer rely on in-person auctions with  
other dealers to sell the cars it acquired on trade-in that did not meet  
its quality standards.  
These new car-buying and car-selling experiences comprised several  
related product efforts having to do with all stages of the transaction.  
These stages ranged from financing, to making an “instant-offer” for  
a trade-in, to electronically making the down payment and agreeing  
to the financing terms via electronic document signature, to  
arranging delivery logistics including curbside, touchless delivery, or  
home delivery, and to the new “love your car guarantee,” which  
extended the warranty period from 30 to 90 days, and the return  
window from 7 to 30 days, which was unmatched in the automotive  
industry.  
All these aspects of the transaction are by definition risky, as they  
involve a major consumer purchase, but some of the areas had  
especially high risk.  
For CarMax, which has a business model predicated on consistent  
margins, the company had to ensure that the pricing both for the  
cars it purchased, and those it sold, was accurate and fair.  
CarMax had to be sure it could describe and communicate clearly  
and accurately the true state of the car, because if the retail customer, or the wholesale dealer buying at auction, was surprised  
once they saw the physical car, they would lose trust in CarMax and  
likely not complete the transaction.  
To address these risks, the product teams tested prototypes first in  
very small groups, then regionally, and finally nationally.  
Key components of the new sales model continued to roll out as the  
testing progressed, and within only six months from the onset of the  
pandemic, CarMax had all the key elements of the car-buying and  
car-selling process operational nationally.  
# The Results  
After suffering a severe revenue hit at the beginning of the pandemic,  
CarMax quickly recovered the lost revenue and more—becoming one  
of the few auto industry innovation success stories.  
Over the two years that followed, the new technology-powered  
services provided a much richer customer and associate experience  
than the more manual-based solutions used prior to the pandemic.  
Today, CarMax has earned a reputation as one of the best places to  
work for product and technology talent, and the speed and abilities  
of the product and technology organization helped earn the trust of  
colleagues across the rest of the company.  
None of us can know what the future will bring, but the CarMax team  
has proven that it can respond quickly and effectively to solve  
important and difficult problems for their customers and for their  
company. PART V  
# Transformation Story\: Trainline  
By Jon Moore  
Marty's Note\: In just a few short years, Trainline became one of  
Europe's best examples of tech-powered product innovation—  
completely turning around its business in the process. One thing  
that was a bit unusual is that this transformation started when a  
large private equity firm, KKR, purchased Trainline because it  
\(correctly\) believed the business was significantly undervalued and  
that if Trainline moved to the product model, the company could  
unleash real value. KKR brought in a strong CEO, Clare Gilmartin,  
who then brought in a proven head of engineering, Mark Holt, and  
a proven head of product, Jon Moore. Here Jon shares a first-  
person account of this impressive transformation.  
In January 2015, one of the world's largest private equity companies,  
KKR  
—  

famed for inventing the leveraged buyout  
—  

announced it  
had purchased Trainline, a long-standing reseller of UK rail tickets.  
The acquisition, on the face of it, made limited sense. Rail remains a  
supremely legacy industry. Ticketing changes can require  
multibillion-pound infrastructure investments, and the entire  
industry is subject to close governmental scrutiny. In such an  
environment, the route to growth is normally measured not in  
months or years, but in decades.  
With these constraints, Trainline appeared to offer little room to  
achieve the kind of progress demanded by KKR's portfolio.  
What followed was a remarkable achievement, one led by a new,  
young CEO plucked directly from eBay to spearhead a dramatic  
transformation away from legacy rail and toward a strong consumer-  
technology business.  
The Motivation When the new CEO, Clare Gilmartin, hired me as the company's first  
chief product officer, she warned me that every part of the  
organization would need to change if we were to achieve anything  
like our expected trajectory.  
The company was making little progress. Trainline had a classic IT  
model doing what it could to serve the business but providing few  
results.  
Software engineering was nascent and, in many areas, outsourced.  
Product management was completely absent, save for a few  
individuals who had been given the vaguely defined title of product  
owner.  
The few designers who did exist described themselves as owning a  
variety of marketing assets.  
The products themselves were woefully outdated.  
Originally launched in 1997, Trainline offered a solution to the chaos  
that followed the privatization of the UK's rail network. Some years  
earlier, the state-owned British Rail had been disbanded in an  
attempt to foster innovation and competition.  
But it had been rushed, and the resulting network of contracts  
involved more than 100 companies. The customer entry points were  
confusing and varied. Purchasing rail tickets often appeared to  
require an understanding of which company was running the line on  
which you wanted to travel.  
Trainline's centralized online booking platform provided an answer.  
Allowing customers to skip the daily frustrations of booking office  
queues, it sold its first online ticket in 1999 and, over the next  
decade, gradually established a toehold in the market. But then the  
company stalled.  
In 2014, Trainline was purchased by KKR, which saw an opportunity  
and persuaded a talented modern technology leader to leave eBay  
and take on her first CEO role. She brought on an experienced chief  
technology officer, Mark Holt, and me to run product.  
The three of us quickly bonded as a team and got to work on our  
respective areas. Changing How We Build  
Engineering, product management, and design were prioritized, and  
early executive meetings were regularly dominated by conversations  
concerning ongoing recruitment needs and talent gaps.  
Engineering needed urgent investment. Outsourcing was rife, and  
the more senior engineering roles were filled not with internal talent,  
but by multiple contractors who had gained significant knowledge of  
the various complexities of the platforms and systems, but had little  
purchase in the future direction of the company.  
The organization was operating on eight-week release cycles, not  
close to being good enough to allow us to serve customers effectively.  
We had inherited a classic CIO culture. Technology had simply been  
treated as a necessary cost.  
The consequences were easily visible. Tech debt was rampant;  
systems were monolithic and fully on-premises. A significant  
technical turnaround was needed quickly.  
Every job spec was rewritten, a growing number of new engineers  
were recruited, and a new tech lead role was created at the team  
level. In truth, a significant number of individuals were let go.  
The engineering challenge was considerable. Trainline's legacy data  
center, consisting of hundreds of servers, was unfit for its purpose.  
Then we received notice that the building we occupied was due to be  
demolished.  
Yet within 18 months, Trainline had been fully migrated to AWS and  
was accelerating quickly toward being 100 percent cloud native.  
In time, over 20,000 individual components were released into the  
cloud, at a rate of more than 100 a week. “One afternoon in May,”  
Mark remembers, “somebody said, ‘By the way, everything is in  
continuous delivery!’ It was a truly fantastic moment.”  
Engineering was on a fast track, not just structurally but culturally.  
New recruits were chosen not simply for their technical prowess \(our  
AWS migration had been run by one of the most accomplished cloud  
experts in the UK\) but based on their desire and ability to  
understand customers. Engineers were expected to use the product extensively, and to  
understand as much of the customer and business context as  
possible.  
# Changing How We Solve Problems  
With impressive engineering talent arriving rapidly, the need to  
achieve strong product management was critical. I had inherited a  
team used to delivering on requirements from stakeholders. These  
servants to the business had little understanding of product  
discovery or how strong product teams solve problems for customers  
in ways that customers love yet work for the business.  
But the new mandate was clear. We needed a strong PM discipline at  
the heart of the business. Our intention was to rapidly transform into  
a machine that could uncover—and then achieve—maximum value.  
I had feared we would need a clean sweep of talent. But, on entry, a  
number of individuals made it clear they wanted to learn how to  
work like the best. And I quickly realized that one, more recent hire  
had maximum potential.  
As a whole, the team had not been exposed to modern product  
management, but they were intelligent, ambitious, and anxious to  
learn. I decided to give them the opportunity to show what they  
could do.  
Coaching became a first-order priority, and multiple hours were  
spent every day working individually with team members. We  
discussed the critical importance of product discovery, key  
techniques, and the mandatory need for a much faster and stronger  
test-and-learn cadence.  
To support the shift in culture, a wider informal meeting was set up  
every Friday afternoon called “Weekly Wins.” My intention was to  
create a safe space for all teams to come together and discuss and  
debate progress. It quickly generated its own momentum. Discovery  
insights, test data, and prototypes were all regularly showcased.  
Questions were asked and ideas were discussed. Communication and  
coordination improved significantly. These Weekly Wins rapidly  
became the meetings nobody wanted to miss. Everywhere we turned there were multiple issues to be addressed.  
Travel is by nature inspirational, yet our products were  
unquestionably transactional and uninspired.  
With so many early potential priorities, we quickly decided that the  
product strategy should be to focus on two critical core problems\:  
mobile apps usage and site conversion. These areas offered the  
prospect of immediate and dramatic results.  
Trainline was still almost entirely desktop focused, a miss of almost  
ten years. As a marketplace, conversion expertise was also a clear  
growth lever, but few tests had been run and there was no data  
platform to speak of.  
The company had been using an external consultancy to spearhead  
optimization. The monthly cost ran into the tens of thousands of  
pounds.  
When I pointed out that only eight tests had been run in the previous  
12 months—at a cost of nearly £40,000 per test, and with none  
offering any obvious upside—there was little argument to ripping up  
the contract. We would grow our own muscles in this area, and we  
needed to do it quickly.  
Our newly created mobile apps team led the way, iterating quickly to  
achieve a product that quickly gained traction within the Apple  
ecosystem—dominating the category rankings. We were determined  
to set the bar high, selecting the team carefully to create an internal  
bar raiser. They did not disappoint.  
Led by an impressive new product manager and tech lead, who  
together brought significant ambition and pace, the break from the  
past could not have been more visible.  
Our mobile usage grew rapidly, and as leadership, we repeatedly  
celebrated the outcomes and the team.  
We realized this might be frustrating for others in the company. But,  
in offering a concrete example of the new cultural expectations, we  
were attempting to jolt others into understanding what it meant to  
focus on business outcomes. And it worked. With a strong emphasis on recruiting and coaching, we gained  
momentum quickly. Team by team, others followed their example.  
# Design as a Superpower  
The design team was explicitly recruited to achieve a strong bias  
toward high-velocity qualitative testing. Prototyping became a key  
strength. Rapid user prototypes were consistently used across all  
teams to gain quick feedback on myriad potential solutions.  
The team grew quickly, though not without first overcoming some  
resistance. At one point, finance rejected additional hiring in product  
design. Understand that this was a private equity–backed business  
where controlling expenditure is always a focus. But we needed  
product designers to get the most out of our investment in product  
management and engineering.  
I realized my initial appeal had failed because I had not shared the  
evidence of the business results. When I shared the improved  
outcomes we were delivering in the teams with strong product design  
talent, the design staff hiring was quickly approved.  
With so many parallel workstreams, we designed our team topology  
to lower cognitive load and minimize dependencies. This choice was  
bolstered by our growing investment in a cloud-based microservices  
platform, allowing us to minimize—though not eliminate—  
dependencies.  
A variety of experience teams took charge of our main device-based  
experiences \(desktops and mobile\), and while this evolved  
over time  
with the addition of further teams targeting newer B2B and ancillary  
growth opportunities, our more detailed conversations were reserved  
for how we intended to invest in our platform. Specifically, data.  
# Investing in Data Science  
With our data stored across a wide variety of systems in multiple,  
inconsistent formats, there was no obvious data strategy to build  
upon.  
“Our data is a box of gold with 10 inches of dust on top,” I told Clare.  
“We just need to build the means to access it.” I was making the case for yet another significant investment, but Clare already saw the  
potential.  
Despite a long list of competing priorities, Mark forged ahead with  
the data engineering recruitment, and, in parallel, I took on the  
challenge of building out our first data science team.  
We knew we were investing somewhat ahead of the curve. Beyond  
the obvious need to be better able to organize our data and  
supercharge our site optimization workstreams, we had little real  
concept of what these teams ultimately would be capable of. But we  
knew enough to understand that, without them, we would be limiting  
our potential solutions considerably.  
# Empowered Engineers  
To help cement the ongoing transformation toward a modern  
product culture, we organized our first hack day. Teams were able to  
focus on any customer or business problem they chose. In truth, the  
main objective was to encourage the engineers to pursue more of  
their own ideas and to further enhance the innovation culture we  
were building. We were not expecting immediate results, but we  
were delighted to be proved wrong.  
With brilliant simplicity, a single engineer chose to solve the pressing  
issue of helping customers choose less crowded trains, itself a  
consistent customer pain point.  
The rail operators had previously attempted to address this via a  
complex multimillion-pound upgrade in floor-based pressure  
sensors. “But why not simply ask the customers?” the engineer  
proposed. After all, we were already operating at a significant scale,  
and with a small addition to the mobile application, travelers might  
just care enough to tell us.  
And indeed, they did. Within weeks, the initial hack had been  
validated via a live-data prototype, generating hundreds of  
thousands of data points.  
Our new data science team got to work, which allowed us to present  
the results back to customers. It was the first, critical example of our  
growing ability to harness data. And it also achieved a significant amount of free publicity—not just across national media, as nice as  
that was to see, but also in the halls of some very influential tech  
companies. Google's maps team reached out, and the Amazon AWS  
team took notice.  
Engineering's significant efforts to lift and shift our platform quickly  
onto AWS had created a new strong partner. AWS was impressed by  
our expertise, and we were invited to showcase at that year's high-  
profile AWS conference,  
re\:Invent  
.  
Trainline headlined the event, and we were introduced by AWS CTO  
Werner Vogels himself. The solution born out of our hack day was  
showcased at the heart of our presentation.  
We were providing real-time data across millions of rail journeys to  
help customers choose a less crowded carriage, all powered by  
unique user-generated data built on AWS. A number of high-profile  
engineers, who were among the thousands watching that day, opted  
to join the company. It was another example of how the impact of  
real transformation can propel a company forward in multiple  
unplanned ways.  
# Changing How We Decide What Problems to  
# Solve  
Trainline's mission, to make rail travel easier for everyone, had long  
been championed as an important factor in helping the UK achieve  
lower carbon transport choices. Indeed, many employees—me  
included—regarded that as a key reason for joining the company.  
But a shared motivation, while helpful, is never enough to achieve  
meaningful alignment. With a consistent stream of talented new  
employees entering the building, it was clear that we needed to  
showcase a consolidated future. If we all pulled together and  
executed to our new, higher expectations, what might success look  
like? We needed a modern, strong product vision—one that would  
bind our shareholders, executives, stakeholders, and product teams  
together, as one.  
To achieve that goal required a detailed understanding of our most  
pressing customer problems. Having already set some significant strategic business goals \(international expansion, revenue  
diversification\), the product vision would come from understanding  
and then solving numerous critical pain points for our customers.  
A new head of product research joined with a significant skill set in  
deep customer analysis. Her team's goal was to produce a  
comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of our current and  
potential new customers, and how we could best achieve maximum  
value on their behalf.  
Initially selecting small, representative cohorts in each of our various  
target geographies, we conducted multiple rounds of interviews,  
uncovering hundreds of issues. But we also saw major and  
immediate patterns—a small number of problems kept being  
mentioned over and over. We quickly gave these a name\: the “Super  
Seven.”  
These seven problems appeared to be critical shared problems that  
cut across all customer territories and segments. Once we had  
validated our conclusions at scale, it quickly became clear\: Solving  
even a handful of these issues might just be enough to propel us into  
a new era of growth.  
But there was a problem. People thought of Trainline as a ticket  
company. Yet many of these issues were playing out downstream of  
the transaction flow, after the ticket had been purchased.  
We were a rail-oriented e-commerce site, ingesting multiple rail APIs  
to help customers transact and buy tickets. Yet many of these newly  
uncovered problems existed beyond the transaction, such as missed  
connections, delays, or overcrowded trains.  
Such issues had long existed in rail, but no one had ever achieved  
satisfactory solutions. Perhaps for good reason. They were complex  
problems, and we were unsure if we could help to solve any of them.  
But we knew if we could solve these problems, then we could  
significantly improve the lives and commutes of our customers.  
Centered strongly around mobile, our vision showcased an ambitious  
future. An early mobile application test, offering customers an ability  
to switch from paper to digital tickets, had been run. It resulted in a major insight\: On these small number of mobile-approved routes,  
the frequency of rail travel and sales overall increased significantly.  
The test had not been straightforward to run. In highly regulated  
environments, successful product innovation is frequently the result  
of significant amounts of complex work with partners, unions,  
regulatory bodies, and even governments.  
We had a small but expert operations team that spent countless  
hours evangelizing with our rail partners. Little strong progress  
would have been achieved without them.  
A shift to digital rail tickets would require our partners to make  
substantive changes to real-world working practices, underpinned by  
a multimillion-pound investment in infrastructure upgrades.  
Achieving this would require full governmental support, and a major  
update to the UK's transport policy.  
But the data was clear. By allowing customers to skip the pain of  
ticket machines and more easily make changes and refunds, rail  
became a more relevant travel choice.  
Like most dramatically successful tests, the result appears obvious  
with hindsight, but this was a substantial new data point\: Mobile  
tickets increased the frequency of rail travel and, in doing so,  
increased customer lifetime value. This insight, alongside the  
associated deep understanding of how we could alleviate as much  
customer pain as possible, formed the core of a product strategy that  
allowed us to achieve a new and consistent path forward.  
By now, we had perfected a solid quarterly cadence for the product  
teams, culminating in two high-profile days in front of the executive  
team at the end of each quarter.  
Outcomes were front and center, and team members were  
significantly exposed to leadership\: This was a format now enjoyed  
by most, even if it caused stress because outcomes are so much  
tougher to achieve than simply shipping output. But there was no  
going back. We would win or lose on the strength of the teams' ability  
to deliver results.  
Our architecture had been reborn and was now a shining example of  
a cloud-native platform. The product teams had been empowered and reoriented toward strong outcomes.  
Driven by highly collaborative product teams, we were testing  
hundreds of product ideas every year. Our data sets were now  
centralized, consistent, and useful. Our customer location data  
pointed at new possibilities to solve downstream delays and  
congestion. We were able to harness new and unique user-generated  
data, which was added to our already considerable journeys and  
pricing data. In parallel, we had begun to create our own machine-  
generated data—providing the ability to create ever more unique  
ways to solve a variety of entrenched, longstanding problems.  
# The Results  
Trainline was now capable of doing things in the rail industry that no  
one had ever seen before.  
One analyst memorably referred to us as the “Uber of Rail,” a huge  
compliment at the time, given Uber's ongoing success and our late  
starting point. Given that Trainline was now the \#1 travel app in the  
App Store from Monday through Friday, above Uber, we enjoyed the  
analogy. It represented a significant perception change at precisely  
the time when the market was deciding how to value our business.  
A little more than four years after KKR purchased the company for  
below £500 million, the bell rang in London's Stock Exchange, and  
the company was valued at just over £2 billion, one of the largest  
European IPOs of the year.  
The transformation had been successful. The power of capable  
product managers, designers, engineers, and data scientists—  
combined  
with our expert operational and legal teams—allowed us to  
dramatically increase our trajectory.  
Problems to solve had replaced features to build; strong metrics had  
replaced supposition. Technology was now front and center.  
Week by week, month by month, our visible success attracted ever  
more impressive talent to push us rapidly forward.  
We had repositioned the company beyond rail, into the much  
broader \(and more lucrative\) travel category, also launching across multiple new geographies and even diversifying our travel options  
beyond rail into coach \(bus\).  
Led by strong leadership, a deep understanding of the possibilities of  
strong technology talent, a highly collaborative culture, and, above  
all, a dedicated focus on outcomes, a small team improved the lives  
of millions of travelers and achieved an exceptional return for  
shareholders. PART VI  
# The Product Model in Action  
Thus far we've mainly discussed the theory behind the product  
operating model. In this part, we want to try to bring this way of  
working to life.  
In the innovation stories, we shared what it's like inside a product  
team, but here we want to give you a glimpse into what this looks like  
as product teams interact with customers and with different parts of  
the company, including sales, marketing, finance, stakeholders, and  
executives.  
There's one thing we want you to keep in mind as you read the  
chapters in this part\: The chapters describe the interactions that you  
strive for. Since these interactions involve people, sometimes you'll  
fall short of your intentions.  
The chapters here describe the case where the interactions are ideal.  
But even in the very best companies, with the very best people and  
intentions, things won't always go as you might like. CHAPTER 21  
# Partnering with Customers  
In many companies that follow the prior models, especially  
companies that provide products to businesses, the relationship with  
customers is too often not where anyone wants it to be.  
From the customers' perspective, the company may be perceived as  
unreliable and untrustworthy, incapable of delivering on its  
promises.  
There are many reasons for this, but the bottom line is that the  
product model introduces a new, direct, and very different  
relationship between customers and the product teams.  
As a company moves to the product model, there are some fairly  
significant changes to how the product teams need to interact with  
customers.  
1  
Most of those changes are not directly visible to customers, as they  
involve how product teams do their daily work to discover and  
deliver solutions.  
But as you know by now, the product model relies on direct and  
frequent interaction between the product team and the actual users  
and customers.  
Partly this is to gain a deeper understanding of customers' problems  
and the environment and context in which a successful solution  
needs to operate, and partly this is to test your potential solutions to  
make sure that solution is valuable to customers, and usable by the  
various types of users.  
We like to encourage product teams to explain their intentions as  
they begin to interact directly and intensely with users and  
customers, as this change may be very different from the customers'  
perspective as well.  
Most customers are used to just dictating features they believe they  
need to their salesperson, and then they expect to see their features on a product roadmap at some point, hopefully soon, with a date  
they can start planning toward. It is also possible that the customers  
have already begun to lose confidence in the company's ability to  
deliver those features on the promised dates.  
At some point, a frustrated customer may seek another company's  
product. But if customers currently are dependent on the company's  
products, for better or worse, they usually will try to hold on for as  
long as they can.  
So, most customers are open to the idea of a change in the dynamics,  
but only if they believe that they're  
more  
likely to get their needs met  
rather than  
less  
likely.  
The interactions that follow are intended to describe what customers  
can expect from an empowered product team working in the product  
model, and the reasons behind the differences. If you think these  
interactions are useful, you will need to decide if you would like to  
adopt these as they are, or modify them to suit your situation.  
# Promises  
No longer do product teams promise a date or a deliverable until and  
unless they truly understand what will be required to deliver on that  
promise. This is very different than how you likely have been  
working, and this change has several significant implications\:  
The product team making that promise will need to engage  
directly  
with the relevant users and customers to truly understand what will  
be necessary to succeed. Note that companies often have well-  
meaning people assigned to manage relationships with customers,  
just as customers often have well-meaning people assigned to  
manage relationships with vendors. But these proxies—whether from  
your company or the customer—are not sufficient. Direct access  
between the product team and actual users is  
essential  
, and a  
prerequisite to any commitments.  
The only people who can make a promise for a product deliverable  
are the product team that will be responsible for delivering on this  
promise. Not the company's executives, not sales, not marketing, not customer  
success, not program or delivery managers, and not product  
managers. The promise must come from the  
product teams  
,  
including and especially the  
engineers  
on those teams, who need to  
fulfill that promise.  
The product team will not make a promise until and unless they have  
conducted enough product discovery work to understand what is  
truly required, and whether that solution will be effective for the  
customer. This normally means one or more prototypes to address  
the specific risks. Once the needs are understood, the team will also  
factor in other work and commitments before they are ready to make  
any promise. We call these promises  
high-integrity commitments  
,  
and the product teams that make these commitments strive to do  
everything humanly possible to deliver on these commitments once  
made.  
Strong product teams recognize that making commitments must be  
weighed alongside your other commitments, including potentially  
impacted keep-the-lights-on activities. What makes the commitment  
“high-integrity” is because it is based on first looking deeply at what  
is necessary, and then coming directly from the people who will need  
to deliver on the commitment.  
The product team may need to remind the customer that it works for  
a commercial product company. Thus, the job of the product team is  
to come up with a solution that not only the specific customer  
believes is effective, but is one that will work for other customers as  
well.  
This is the essential difference between a custom solution provider  
and a commercial product company. What this means in practice is  
that sometimes the specific solution that the customer has in mind is  
not general enough to work for other customers, and so the product  
team will need to explore alternative approaches. Most of the time,  
this is solvable and results in a better solution for all involved. But if  
it were to turn out that the necessary solution would work only in a  
single customer's environment, and the customer understands that it  
would not have the benefits of ongoing innovation and service, then  
normally the product team would instead direct the customer to a  
custom solution provider. Product Discovery  
The purpose of product discovery is to come up with an effective  
solution to your customers' problems. Your product team strives to  
discover solutions that your customers love, yet work for your  
business.  
To do this, the product team has a cross-functional set of skills in  
product management, product design, and engineering. The product  
team engages directly with users and customers to deeply  
understand the problem that needs to be solved, and to test out  
potential solutions.  
For the majority of direct customer interactions, the product team  
focuses both on understanding the customer's problem and on  
determining if you have come up with a valuable, usable, feasible,  
and viable solution.  
As such, most of the direct interactions between the product team  
and the customer involve interviewing the different users and testing  
prototypes of solutions with those users.  
# Product Delivery  
Once the product team has discovered and developed the necessary  
solutions, you have additional obligations to appropriately serve your  
customers\:  
First, you promise to effectively test your solutions, which means two  
different activities.  
1\. You will test that the new capability works as expected.  
2\. You will test that the new capability does not inadvertently  
introduce any problems elsewhere. These are called regressions,  
and while preventing regressions is difficult, and sometimes  
they occur despite best efforts, you also acknowledge you have a  
responsibility to ensure that new capabilities do not come along  
with unexpected problems.  
You also understand that your customers urgently need the solutions  
you are building, but you also acknowledge that customers have their own jobs to do. Spending time recertifying your product and  
relearning and retraining on it is not something anyone wants to do,  
nor should they be required to do. You strive always to be sensitive to  
the cost of incorporating new capabilities into daily use, and you use  
modern design and deployment techniques to smooth adoption  
whenever possible.  
Finally, you know you can't realistically promise that you will never  
make mistakes. However, you can promise to use best practices and  
best efforts to minimize those mistakes. And most important, you  
can promise that when mistakes are made, you will do everything in  
your power to correct the issue quickly and competently, and then  
analyze how you can avoid that problem in the future.  
# Happy, Referenceable Customers and Business  
# Impact  
Your product team's highest-order goal is to do everything you can to  
get each of your customers to the point where they are effectively  
using your products every day to do important and meaningful work,  
and for your customers to love and value your products so much that  
they happily share their experience with others. This customer  
success is then reflected in your business success.  
This is how you feel about your favorite products, and you strive to  
work every day to ensure your customers also feel that way about  
your products.  
# Note  
1  
We use the general term “customers” here to refer to the many  
different forms of customer that may be relevant—different types  
of users, buyers, approvers, influencers, internal colleagues using  
technology to serve end customers, and so on. CHAPTER 22  
# Partnering with Sales  
Please note that this chapter does not apply to all companies and all  
types of products. But when it does apply—when the company has a  
direct or channel sales force responsible for bringing its products to  
market—the relationship between the product organization and the  
sales organization can literally make or break the success of the  
company.  
There are perhaps no two more interdependent roles in a company  
than product and sales.  
Product depends on sales to get its products into the hands of its  
customers. And sales depends on product providing them with  
solutions that truly meet their customers' needs.  
If either one falters, we have a real problem.  
Yet, despite this seemingly natural alignment in incentive, in practice  
they are too often pursuing very different goals. In so many  
organizations using the prior models, neither product nor sales is  
happy.  
Product is not happy because sales keeps requesting \(or demanding\)  
they build things that they know are not going to solve the customers'  
real problems.  
And sales is not happy because they are simply relaying the demands  
of the customers, yet product keeps delivering solutions that don't  
meet the needs of those customers or, worse, not delivering at all.  
Realize that salespeople depend primarily on commissions for their  
income. This comes from new sales, renewals, upsells, and increased  
customer spend with your company.  
For that reason, salespeople are wired to respond very directly to  
customer requests. Unless there's a genuine belief that the product  
team exists to support similar goals, the sales team believes they  
must battle for their very survival. The good news is that the product model is designed to correct this  
issue and has a strong track record of doing just that.  
First, it's essential to understand the necessary relationship between  
product teams and customers, as was described in  
chapter 21  
,  
“Partnering with Customers.” The model of a salesperson collecting  
requirements from a prospective customer, and delivering those  
requirements to a product team to build, is not part of the product  
model.  
However, at the core of the product model is the focus on creating  
happy, referenceable customers, and product needs to collaborate  
with sales to locate and develop these prospective referenceable  
customers.  
It's worth pointing out that when product has not provided these  
happy, referenceable customers, the sales job is dramatically more  
difficult, in addition to fueling sales's distrust of product. It shouldn't  
be a surprise that this situation leads directly to requests for custom  
\(“special”\) solutions in order for sales to be able to sell anything.  
For the necessary changes to occur, the key is to build trust between  
product and sales, and the best way to do this is to spend quality time  
together in front of current and prospective customers. This starts  
with the head of product and the head of sales, but the goal is to  
spread this down to individual product managers and salespeople.  
The salesperson is able to witness up close how product teams can  
discover a winning solution to customers' problems, often with  
solutions that the customers had no idea were possible.  
The product team is able to witness up close how the salesperson  
navigates the many aspects of effective go-to-market to understand  
the buyer, the different types of users, the influencers, the approvers,  
and  
the other factors that play into both the purchase decision and  
successful use of the product.  
Working closely together, the two major dimensions of product-  
market fit start to come into focus. Then working across multiple  
prospective customers, the product team learns both what is  
consistent across customers and what is not, so the product team can  
ensure it is able to create a single solution that will be successfully  
deployed across many customers. None of the above is easy, but what makes it hard is not risk or  
complexity, but rather the effort needed by both product and sales.  
For those willing to put in the time, the rewards are real.  
The product teams, with the help of product marketing, have a  
variety of techniques designed especially for these types of product  
efforts, and the goal is always happy, referenceable customers.  
There is one more powerful consequence of the product model for  
sales\: In most legacy models, the sales organization is the sole  
customer-centric group that is outcome based \(performance  
compensated and incented on sales\). The product model gives sales a  
true partner that is also customer centered and outcome based.  
When done well, product and sales are truly collaborative partners. CHAPTER 23  
# Partnering with Product Marketing  
One of the closest partners for product teams is your associated  
product marketing manager \(PMM\). It's not hard to see why  
establishing an effective partnership between product and product  
marketing is key to the product model working well.  
In a few companies, the product team will be fortunate enough to be  
paired with a PMM \(dedicated just to the product team\), but in most  
cases, multiple product teams will share one or more PMMs. This is  
simply because it rarely makes sense to organize product marketing  
in the same way you structure your team topologies. Whether you  
have a dedicated PMM, or whether you share one or more PMMs, the  
product manager will want to reach out and establish the necessary  
relationship\(s\).  
The nature and frequency of your interactions will range based on  
what you're working on at the moment, but there are quite a few  
different interactions where you'll need to collaborate.  
While most people have at least an intuitive sense of the interactions  
with product marketing, many are surprised to see the depth and  
power of a strong and effective collaboration.  
Here's what you strive for in the product model.  
# Market Understanding and Competitive Analysis  
As product teams work to understand different markets, the PMM is  
a key resource with access to industry analysts, market insights,  
competitive research, and more. Moreover, as you learn about new  
competitors and new technologies, this information is shared  
between the product teams and product marketing.  
A good example of a collaboration in the area of market  
understanding would be to evaluate a new competitive offering and put together a response that can be shared with the sales  
organization.  
# Product Go-to-Market  
Product go-to-market is arguably the most important area of  
collaboration. When working on a new product for an existing  
market, or when taking an existing product to a new market, or  
especially in the case of creating a new product for a new market,  
coming up with an effective product is only half the problem. The  
other half is working out how to effectively get that product into the  
hands of customers, known as the product's  
go-to-market  
.  
Your PMM partner is your resident expert on the many go-to-market  
alternatives and techniques, and when working to come up with  
product-market fit, product and product marketing need to work  
together to solve for the many constraints.  
Once product go-to-market has been established, the PMM works to  
make sure each of the product teams understands the power and  
nuances of this path to market.  
Even later, with incremental changes to the product, there may be  
messaging or positioning considerations based on the go-to-market  
where the product manager will want to consult with the PMM.  
# Key Product Decisions  
Product decisions come up all the time in product discovery, and for  
many of those you will want to consult with your PMM partner. But  
for especially important decisions, because the PMM has such deep  
knowledge of the target markets and the product's go-to-market, the  
product team will want to be sure to include the PMM's perspective.  
To be clear, a product's go-to-market is one of the most important  
considerations in determining successful product strategies.  
# Customer Discovery Program  
The customer discovery program is a technique that is especially  
powerful for creating new products, or taking existing products to new markets, and this technique is designed to be a collaboration  
between the product team and product marketing.  
You can learn more about this technique in the book  
INSPIRED  
, but  
it involves identifying, selecting, and working closely with a set of  
prospective customers from the same target market. Partnering with  
product marketing and sales, you interview and select these  
customers, and then proceed to discover and deliver a solution  
designed to meet their needs. The result is your initial set of  
referenceable customers.  
The product manager and the product marketing manager work  
closely on all aspects of this program. The product manager applies  
the learnings to the new product while the product marketing  
manager applies the learnings to the go-to-market, sales tools, and  
sales process.  
# Messaging and Positioning  
Even with day-to-day changes to the product, often visible changes  
have implications for messaging and positioning.  
Sometimes these changes are tactical, and sometimes the messaging  
and positioning have broad implications for the product.  
In this case, the product manager or the product designer may  
consult with the PMM to ensure alignment and that the new  
capability will be noticed, understood, and adopted.  
# Customer Impact Assessment  
With modern product delivery techniques such as continuous  
deployment, changes are happening many times a day, but there are  
certain changes that may have an impact on your customers, your  
sales team, or your customer success team. In this case, you need to  
coordinate with your PMM partner to ensure that the upcoming  
change is not a surprise and that they are all prepared.  
If the PMM partner is not prepared, maybe because they only just  
found out about the change, then either you would hold off on the  
changes, or if you have the suitable deployment infrastructure, you could release the new capability in such a way that it is not yet visible  
to customers until the PMM reports that they are ready.  
# Pricing and Packaging  
In most companies today following the product model, the product  
teams defer to product marketing for pricing and packaging  
decisions.  
This is due partly to expertise \(many product marketing groups have  
relationships with specialty pricing firms\), and partly because pricing  
is usually done at a higher granularity than the product team, which  
is more aligned to product marketing.  
Product teams certainly provide input to the pricing decisions, but  
many other factors are used to calculate the ideal price.  
# Sales Enablement  
The various product teams each contribute expertise to the PMM,  
but the PMM is responsible for the product's collateral and the  
various sales tools used to equip the sales force with what they need.  
If product managers have spent time developing the relationship  
with the PMM, hopefully the product teams feel good about the  
PMM's level of understanding of the product's capabilities and  
nuances. Understand that if this is not the case, then much of this  
work will fall on the product managers. This is why experienced  
product managers learn that spending time explaining nuance to the  
product marketing manager is often a very high-leverage use of their  
time.

the SVPG book\:  
LOVED, How to Rethink Marketing for Tech  
Products  
by Martina Lauchengco. CHAPTER 24  
# Partnering with Finance  
Partnering with finance, and often with the related investor relations,  
is a critical part of the job because there is simply no viable  
alternative to working together effectively. The company depends on  
the products it sells, and product people depend on finance.  
As with so many other areas, the key to working together effectively  
lies in alignment, understanding the needs and constraints of the  
partner, and providing data rather than opinions.  
First, it's important for the head of product to establish with the head  
of finance the reasons for the move to the product model.  
Start by looking together at the data and acknowledging that the  
current model is not very predictive in making good funding  
decisions, and not very predictive in estimating incremental revenue  
from product. If there's doubt, you can see this by comparing the  
business case claims with the actual results from the prior quarters.  
More generally, it's important to acknowledge that the old model  
simply wastes too much money and time, not to mention opportunity  
cost, and generates far too little in the way of demonstrable business  
results.  
Usually this much is painfully clear. The only real question is  
whether we can do better.  
# Testing the Product Model  
The case to be made is to test out the product model, and learn  
together if it can provide the improved returns that it has provided to  
other companies.  
Depending on the level of frustration with the old model, and the  
level of urgency to get to the new model, you can test out the new  
model either very conservatively \(with a small number of product  
teams\) or more aggressively. It may also be useful to point out that if the move to the product  
model succeeds, then in addition to happier customers and better  
business results, the company might also get valued by public  
markets at least in part as a tech-powered company, which is often a  
motivation for investors.  
# Product and Finance Collaboration  
As part of moving to the product model, a number of interactions  
would change in how product and finance collaborate\:  
The product teams promise to stop hiding behind features and  
roadmaps, always promising better results once the next new feature  
is ready. The product teams will stop making up business cases and  
then making up excuses when the results don't materialize.  
Instead, product signs up to be measured just as your company is  
measured, by business results. If the company launches a new  
product, it will be measured by business success. If the company  
adds a new capability, it will be measured by value and business  
impact.  
If a product team signs up to solve a customer or company problem,  
it will define success by business results, and the team will work until  
that result is achieved, whether that means one new feature or many  
features or a different approach to the solution.  
The product team will admit what they don't know, and tell you  
honestly what they can't know. When an answer with integrity is  
needed, they will run the necessary testing to get the data to make an  
informed business decision.  
Going forward, when they bring you a request for incremental  
resources, they will bring you data, and a transparent analysis with  
the reasoning for that request.  
Rather than large funding requests, the product team will first run  
very low-cost tests to collect the necessary data. Then, if they have a  
larger request, it will be accompanied by the actual data that  
supports this investment.  
In the cases where the company needs a date that can be counted on  
for a deliverable, the product team will use a process to deliver a high-integrity commitment. While this takes somewhat more time,  
the date will be defensible, and something against which teams can  
be held accountable.  
When the product model starts producing real and consistent  
innovation, product will remember to share with finance and  
investor relations the evidence that these investments are paying off  
with real results.  
# Requests of Finance  
For this partnership to work, there are a few things that product  
needs from finance\:  
Rather than make funding decisions on a project basis, product  
asks that you staff product teams with specific focus areas and  
measures of business results, for one or more quarters. The  
product teams will provide real-time business results with  
results judged quarterly.  
The product model requires several new job competencies. In  
most cases, existing employees can be coached and trained, but  
in the event this is not possible, product leadership will provide  
a proposal for replacing existing staff with new staff. It is worth  
noting that in most cases, moving to the product model saves  
money rather than costs money, even though this change may  
involve insourcing critical competencies.  
Rather than being judged on shipping features and projects, the  
product teams ask to be judged on business impact. To do this,  
the product teams need the room to run the necessary tests and  
make decisions about which features and projects will best meet  
the objectives. The intention is to leave this level of granularity  
to the product teams.  
Finally, the product organization asks finance to minimize the  
need for high-integrity commitments, as they represent  
nontrivial work just to provide the date, and they can be  
disruptive to the organization. When product and finance work together effectively, they can get the  
most from their investment dollars, as well as manage the financial  
risks more responsibly and effectively than ever. CHAPTER 25  
# Partnering with Stakeholders  
We define a stakeholder here as someone not explicitly a member of  
a product team, yet who represents a key constituency, area of the  
business, or special expertise.  
There is no denying that moving to the product model represents a  
big change for the business's stakeholders.  
Some of the stakeholders are so frustrated with how things have  
worked in the past that they are desperate to try something new.  
Some will feel they still have the responsibility to deliver for the  
business, but now without the control over the technology resources  
they once had.  
Others will take a wait-and-see approach.  
But in all cases, since in the old model the technology resources were  
there to serve their needs, and now those resources are there to serve  
end customers directly, they realize there's a significant change  
involved.  
The product model is designed to have the product teams as  
collaborative partners with the stakeholders. Yes, they are no longer  
subservient to the stakeholders, but they do still depend on them.  
In practice, this means building trust between the stakeholders and  
the product managers.  
An empowered product team is designed to solve problems for your  
customers or your business, in ways that your customers love,  
yet  
work for your business  
.  
Creating a solution that customers love is usually not that hard,  
assuming the product team has direct, unencumbered access to the  
users and customers, and the product data.  
But creating a solution that the customers love  
and  
that also meets  
the many, often-competing needs of the different parts of the business can be very challenging.  
You need to ensure your solutions can be marketed, sold, and  
serviced effectively. You need to ensure you can fund the product,  
and you can then effectively monetize that product. You need to be  
able to operationalize the product. You need to ensure the product is  
compliant with relevant regulations, respects privacy laws and  
partnership agreements, and does not have unintended  
consequences on people or the environment.  
We know you can't do all this alone.  
But we also realize that to create any product, literally hundreds if  
not thousands of decisions need to be made. Bringing all the relevant  
stakeholders together for every decision is not only an excessive use  
of time and money; we also know committees very rarely innovate.  
To innovate, you need direct access to customers, and direct access  
to the enabling technology.  
We also recognize that for a stakeholder to build a respectful,  
trusting relationship with a product team,  
the onus is on the product  
leadership to ensure that every product team has a competent  
product manager who has put in the work to understand the  
various constraints of the business and to be an effective partner to  
the stakeholders  
.  
Expecting stakeholders to trust a product manager who does not  
have this foundation is not only unrealistic, but also unwise.  
Yet even though product managers are on the product team to  
represent these various business constraints, very few product  
managers know all the relevant business dimensions in sufficient  
depth.  
Therefore, a product team's commitment to stakeholders is that each  
product manager promises to engage directly with each of their  
relevant stakeholders and work to learn and understand the various  
constraints and needs represented by each area.  
Further, product teams realize that it takes time to build this  
knowledge and this trust. Whenever they are considering a solution  
that  
might  
impact a particular stakeholder, the product manager  
commits to show a prototype of the proposed solution to the stakeholder so that they can consider the implications of this change  
before the team builds anything  
.  
Hopefully, if the product manager has correctly understood the  
various constraints, the stakeholder needs only a few minutes to take  
a look and give a thumbs-up.  
However, in the event there is a problem, the product team can  
quickly iterate on the prototype until the stakeholder believes the  
solution will now address their concerns and work for the business.  
Sometimes, this will be easy. Other times, getting a solution that  
works not only for customers, but also for multiple stakeholders—  
each with different needs—may require many iterations to identify a  
solution that solves for all parties. Further, the solution that solves  
for all parties may end up being something that none of the  
stakeholders had imagined was possible.  
More generally, the product manager strives to work toward the  
desired business  
outcomes  
. The product teams know that shipping  
features won't necessarily solve the underlying problem for the  
customer or the business. The product team is committed to  
pursuing the necessary  
results  
.  
But the promise is not to build—and certainly not to ship—any  
solution that does not meet the critical needs of the business.  
In the event that something that is not viable for the business does  
manage to get built—or, worse, gets shipped to customers—the  
product team promises to correct the situation as quickly as possible  
and to determine how the error occurred, so it is not repeated.  
The product managers promise to be respectful of stakeholders' time,  
and to earn their trust. They also strive to be transparent.  
Stakeholders are welcome and encouraged to participate in testing  
with users and customers. They are welcome to look at any of the  
prototypes created. They are welcome to view the data on the  
product—both how the products are used, and the results of live-data  
tests.  
Working together, product teams and stakeholders can solve  
problems for your customers and your company in ways your  
customers could not have imagined possible. CHAPTER 26  
# Partnering with Executives  
Depending on the current culture, moving to the product model may  
represent a significant change in how the executives interact with  
product teams and product leaders.  
Moving to the product model often requires significant cultural  
change, especially when moving from top-down, command-and-  
control leadership styles.  
When we discuss the necessary changes, we mostly focus on the  
changes needed within the product and technology organizations.  
However, an important aspect of transformation is changing the  
dynamics and interactions between the senior executives and the  
product organization.  
It's true that many product leaders and product teams would like to  
think this is as easy as saying to the executives “Please just back off  
and give the product teams space to do their work.”  
But this ignores the reality that executives have very real needs when  
it comes to running the company responsibly and effectively.  
And to push decisions down to product teams, those product teams  
need to understand the strategic context, much of which comes from  
the executives.  
So, rather than reducing the level of interaction, in the product  
model, product teams need frequent, high-quality engagement.  
What we're really talking about is the  
nature  
of these interactions.  
You hope to interact in ways that provide executives with the  
information they need to run the business, yet empower the product  
leaders and product teams to do the work they are capable of.  
We've found that a set of techniques can help encourage constructive  
and effective interactions between the executives and the product  
leaders and product teams. Decisions  
One of the central ideas behind the product model is to push  
decisions down to the product leader or product team that is in the  
best position to come up with the best answer. Normally, those are  
the people working directly with the enabling technology, and  
directly with the users and customers.  
But teams can make good decisions only when they are provided the  
necessary strategic context. So, it's critical for executives to share the  
broader context\: the business strategy, financial parameters,  
regulatory developments, industry trends, and strategic  
partnerships.  
Product teams depend on the executives to share as much of the  
relevant strategic context as possible, so they have the information to  
make good decisions.  
And executives depend on product leaders and product teams to  
share openly and honestly the data and reasoning used to make their  
decisions.  
# Outcomes  
Product teams understand that what matters is results. Whenever  
possible, product teams expect to be accountable for  
outcomes  
rather  
than  
output  
.  
But this works only if product teams are given  
a problem to solve  
\(rather than a particular potential solution to build\) and are then  
empowered to come up with a solution that works.  
To come up with the best solution they can, product teams depend  
on executives to provide as many degrees of freedom as possible to  
solve the problems they're assigned.  
Product teams then promise to take responsibility for coming up  
with a solution to the problem, and make best efforts to  
simultaneously solve for the customers, solve for the business, and  
solve for the technology.  
Disagreements Product teams realize that the executives have the broadest access to  
data and the best understanding of the wider business context. Yet  
product teams have access to the enabling technologies and to the  
actual users and customers interacting with the products every day.  
Product teams realize that at times there will be differences of  
opinion. In the old models, contrarian or counterintuitive ideas are  
not explored and innovation rarely happens. In the product model,  
very often these counterintuitive insights power real innovation. If  
something is important, you coach product teams on how to run tests  
quickly and responsibly to collect the necessary evidence, or where  
necessary, proof.  
Product teams depend on executives to allow for and even encourage  
teams to explore alternative approaches when they believe that's  
necessary to succeed.  
If a product team proposes an approach with associated risk, the  
team promises to responsibly run product discovery tests to collect  
the necessary evidence and then share those findings.  
# Promises  
Product teams understand that there will be times when an executive  
needs to know a specific date for a specific deliverable. The teams  
commit to treat these promises as  
high-integrity commitments  
.  
Product teams understand the damage that is done to an  
organization when promises are made and then not kept.  
Product teams ask that only the product team responsible for  
delivering on a promise be the one to make that promise, and teams  
will not be asked to make a promise or deliver on a commitment  
where they don't know what is involved and what would be required  
to succeed.  
Further, product teams depend on high-integrity commitments  
being the exception and not the rule, as the time and effort in making  
and then delivering on a high-integrity commitment can be  
significant.  
But once a promise is made by a product team, they pledge to then  
take this high-integrity commitment very seriously and do everything within their power to deliver on it.  
# Surprises  
Product teams realize that surprises are sometimes unavoidable, but  
they also know they must try hard to minimize them. This means  
that if there's anything even potentially sensitive, the product  
manager is expected to recognize this and to show and discuss it with  
the impacted stakeholder or executive  
before  
the solution is built.  
One of the worst forms of waste is when a product team builds a  
quality, scalable implementation of some capability, and finds out  
afterward that there is some reason why this is not an acceptable  
solution.  
Product teams commit to preview any potentially risky solution with  
the relevant executives before building it.  
Similarly, if an executive reviews a prototype during discovery and  
doesn't raise any major issues, but once the product is built and in  
production decides that something is now a serious problem, then  
this is likewise very wasteful and frustrating to the organization.  
Regardless of the cause, when something gets built but is then  
deemed to have a serious problem, it is reason to have a postmortem  
discussion to see how that type of waste can be avoided going  
forward.  
# Trust  
Product teams understand that empowerment depends on a degree  
of trust, and they strive to earn that trust.  
Likewise, product leaders and product teams trust that the  
executives are leading the company in a positive direction.  
Neither expects the other to be perfect, but both product leaders and  
product teams each recognize that they depend on the other and  
commit to best efforts to help each other succeed. CHAPTER 27  
# Innovation Story\: Gympass  
Marty's Note\: There are terrific examples of transformation and  
innovation from all over the globe today, and I love what this  
Brazilian scale-up was able to accomplish when they were put to  
the test by the pandemic  
.  
# Company Background  
Gympass is a Brazilian company started in 2012 with the mission to  
improve employee health and well-being by helping to defeat  
inactivity.  
Gympass enabled companies to provide their employees with access  
to a network of more than 50,000 gyms and studios in 11 countries  
through the Gympass platform.  
For the first five years of the company's existence, as it grew from an  
early-stage startup to more than 800 people, there was only a very  
small IT organization. The company mainly depended on a large  
business operations team largely running the business using  
spreadsheets.  
To leverage technology effectively, in 2018 the company decided it  
needed to transform, and the leaders brought in experienced product  
leader Joca Torres as their chief product officer.  
Working with their CTO and CMO, the three leaders rapidly built out  
a technology and product organization. The teams began their work  
by automating most of the tasks done by the business operations  
team, as well as creating all new experiences for the gyms, the end  
users \(the employees\), and the HR staff \(so they could see the impact  
on their employees\).  
These efforts paid off quickly, and the company was on a strong  
growth trajectory going into 2020.  
Unfortunately, then the pandemic hit. One of the industries that was severely and immediately impacted by  
the pandemic was the fitness industry, especially in-person gyms and  
studios.  
Not only were employees often not able to return to the office, they  
couldn't go to their gyms, either.  
Countless gyms and fitness industry companies were forced to  
shutter their doors.  
As with so many companies during this time, the leadership team at  
Gympass was faced with an existential crisis. They knew that their  
mission of defeating inactivity was now more important than ever,  
but they also realized they would need to pivot their approach  
meaningfully and quickly.  
# The Problem to Solve  
Fortunately, the company's product organization had been learning  
and testing many fitness-related product ideas with their users, and  
they had already discovered that a significant portion of users were  
interested in wellness activities beyond gym-based fitness, such as  
meditation, mindfulness, nutrition, and home-based exercise.  
The problem the product teams needed to solve was to provide a  
range of home-based wellness solutions to Gympass users so they  
could maintain their fitness, even without access to a gym or studio.  
Strategically, the product team took a build-and-partner approach—  
building key parts to the solution but partnering with other fitness-  
solution providers for specific vertical fitness solutions.  
# Discovering the Solution  
The team began an intense product discovery effort consisting of a  
rapid series of prototypes intended to address what they considered  
to be the two major risks\:  
The first and most serious risk was to ensure that the solution would  
be  
valuable  
to the end users. If their end users \(the employees of  
their client customers\) would not choose to use the new solution, Gympass knew it was only a matter of time before the companies  
would stop paying for this benefit.  
The second was to ensure that this new product and associated  
business model would be  
viable  
—especially that there was sufficient  
revenue for the fitness partners and, of course, for Gympass—yet still  
complied with the client company's benefits requirements.  
The main tool for this discovery work was a user prototype that  
demonstrated the user experience with the various wellness services.  
There were also several feasibility prototypes testing out the  
necessary partner integrations.  
Once the team felt they had addressed these risks, they needed to  
move from prototype to product in record time.  
In addition to the product development and delivery, the company  
recruited nearly 100 vertical fitness partners in less than two  
months, so they could be sure to cover the range of wellness activities  
in the many languages of their users.  
# The Results  
Gympass rolled out to ten countries within four weeks and went from  
zero to hundreds of thousands of users in just a few months.  
The product team that did this work consisted of one product  
manager, one product designer, and four engineers collaborating  
with a dedicated business operations person and a product  
marketing manager. The sales organization also helped by recruiting  
local partners.  
If Gympass had not invested in the effort to transform, they almost  
certainly would not have had the necessary skills to so rapidly pivot  
the business, and they would very likely have suffered the same fate  
as so many others in the fitness industry.  
Instead, during the course of the pandemic, Gympass managed to  
more than double the number of corporate clients and their revenue.  
Company valuation rose to US \$2.2 billion, resulting in one of the  
success stories of the Latin American tech industry. PART VII  
# Transformation Story\: Datasite  
By Christian Idiodi  
Marty's Note\: When I first learned Christian was going to join this  
company as their head of product, I had already known him for  
several years and considered him one of the industry's top product  
leadership talents. I told him I could get him in as head of product  
at almost any marquee company, but he really wanted to see if he  
could transform an old, sales-driven, financial services company to  
become like the best. Even though I knew he was good, I told him  
that he was picking an exceptionally tough challenge. But if you  
know Christian, you know that he is not intimidated by difficult  
challenges. And he joined with two other proven leaders\: Thomas  
Fredell and Jeremiah Ivan. The three of them managed to redefine  
what is possible  
.  
Located in Minneapolis's industrial district, Merrill Corporation was  
founded in 1968 by Roger Merrill and his wife. When I arrived,  
Merrill was an organization in the midst of an identity crisis, and it  
desperately needed to change.  
Merrill was a traditional, family-owned, brick-and-mortar operation  
primarily known for its financial printing services, which included  
the printing, formatting, and distribution of financial documents,  
such as annual reports, prospectuses, proxy statements, and other  
SEC filings. Merrill also provided document management services to  
help clients organize, store, and share information. Included were  
solutions for document capture, indexing, storage, retrieval, and  
distribution. Other services included virtual data rooms that allowed  
clients to securely share confidential documents and information  
with authorized users.  
But, of course, the world had changed.  
The company knew it needed to transform and, in fact, had already  
tried outsourcing transformation and failed miserably. Moving forward, the CEO Rusty Wiley knew Merrill needed to do  
this itself, so Rusty brought in Thomas Fredell, Jeremiah Ivan, and  
me, and the three of us got to work.  
# The Motivation  
An array of external factors inhibited Merrill's ability to successfully  
compete in this rapidly changing marketplace\:  
Heavy reliance on legacy business  
. Merrill Corporation was  
primarily focused on providing printing and communication  
services to the financial industry. However, with the increasing  
adoption of digital technologies and the decline in traditional  
print media, Merrill's business model was quickly becoming  
outdated.  
Limited technological innovation  
. Merrill lagged behind its  
competitors in terms of updating its existing technology as well  
as bringing new products to market. Part of this deficiency  
stemmed from the company's inability to understand its  
customers' evolving needs.  
Legacy model  
. Merrill had a project-based model for executing  
tasks, combined with a command-and-control approach that  
limited internal motivation and innovation.  
High debt levels  
. The company had a significant amount of  
debt, which put pressure on its financial performance and  
limited its ability to invest in new growth opportunities.  
Reputation damage  
. Merrill Corporation faced several lawsuits  
and regulatory investigations related to data breaches and  
information security issues. These incidents damaged the  
company's reputation and undermined customer trust.  
These were the most pressing problems Merrill was experiencing  
when we joined the company. But I knew they were just symptoms,  
and I needed to identify the root causes.  
A Slow-Moving Train For the people at Merrill Corporation, the reason they had fallen  
behind was simple\: Competitors appeared who were faster, less  
expensive, and knew how to leverage technology.  
And they were right, but only partially. To understand the underlying  
problems, I spent a lot of time with the head of sales, Doug Cullen,  
who turned out to be a trusted ally. He told me\: “Christian, what you  
need to understand is that Merrill is, first and foremost, a sales-  
driven company, which means that our culture derives from that.  
Because the salespeople own the clients, they also own everything  
else. If we decide to solve a customer problem, it's only because the  
salespeople want it solved. If we decide to build a new piece of  
technology, it's only because the salespeople want it built. Sales takes  
the lead in everything, and everyone else simply follows.”  
To underscore this point, Doug told me about the seventh version of  
a new technology platform the company had been developing and  
the software bought to try to compete with new competitors.  
The platform project was managed by a director of sales who had  
outsourced the development to a firm in India. The platform had  
taken close to six years to complete at a cost of over \$6 million.  
When it was finally released, it generated less than \$30,000 in  
revenue.  
So, one root cause was clear\: The power center was within the sales  
organization, and technology had a subservient role. This creates all  
sorts of competitive weaknesses.  
For example, salespeople—driven by personal quotas—will often  
prioritize their specific opportunities over the company's strategic  
goals.  
Different customers can receive different views of the company and  
different levels of service depending on which salesperson they  
interact with, which can negatively impact the company's reputation  
as well as customer loyalty.  
Another problem is that salespeople who are focused on their specific  
deals and opportunities are not well positioned to identify new  
market or product opportunities across the customer base. This leads to a lack of innovation and makes the company vulnerable  
to competitors who are more effective in identifying and addressing  
customer needs.  
# A Disempowered, Mercenary Culture  
The primacy of Merrill's sales-driven culture enabled me to quickly  
identify another of the company's core problems\: disempowerment.  
With an abundance of heroism in the sales and service organizations,  
other parts of the company were treated like mercenaries.  
Engineering was outsourced, decisions were top-down, and teams  
were given roadmaps of features and projects to deliver.  
Merrill's office space, particularly the high cubicles and lack of  
sunlight, generated a feeling of isolation and disconnect among its  
team members.  
This made it difficult, if not impossible, for its employees to  
collaborate and communicate effectively, further reducing their  
sense of empowerment.  
Add to this a hierarchical floor layout, as well as a lack of shared  
spaces, and the result was low morale—and even lower engagement.  
Because Merrill's employees did not feel empowered to make  
decisions or take ownership of their work, they were unwilling to  
take risks or suggest new ideas, for fear of rejection.  
Because innovation and creativity were stifled within the  
organization, the company's ability to adapt to changing market  
conditions was essentially nonexistent.  
# A Lack of Focus  
With more than 4,000 employees spread across 23 countries, Merrill  
Corporation had grown significantly over the years—not organically,  
but by acquisition.  
While Merrill's portfolio of assets was profitable overall, there were  
no unifying synergies or theme. The sales organization didn't have a  
bigger picture to sell to customers. Instead, the company's sales were  
heavily dependent on personal relationships and service. Merrill simply had too many balls in the air. Without a defined vision  
and strategy, the company lacked a clear direction for where it  
wanted to go and how it planned to get there. It was difficult for  
employees to understand what they should be working on and how  
their efforts contributed to the company's overall success. It also was  
nearly impossible for Merrill to decide which products or services to  
invest in, which markets to target, and which initiatives to prioritize.  
Without any focus across its core businesses, Merrill had begun to  
lose market share. A real wake-up call arrived in the form of a new  
competitor called Workiva, which offered customers a modern,  
cloud-based solution.  
As one customer after another began to use Workiva to file their  
quarterly reports and statements, Merrill realized that if it wanted to  
remain a viable force in the marketplace, it had to change. But what  
did change mean?  
# Transforming to the Product Model  
We knew we needed to change how we worked at every level, from  
how we build, to how we discover, to how we focus.  
For a company as old as Merrill Corporation with its ingrained sales-  
driven culture, this meant a deep and profound change.  
For companies that were “born digital,” technology is not separate  
from the business; technology  
is  
the business. For Merrill  
Corporation, the exact opposite was true.  
Merrill was a sales-driven company. Revenue was generated and  
managed by the sales team, so the role of technology was to serve the  
needs of the sales organization.  
For the new model to be successful, technology could no longer be  
subservient to sales. Instead, it had to move to the forefront where its  
primary role was to serve the customer—as both a solver of problems  
and an enabler of solutions.  
Changing How We Build As a result of age, long-term underinvestment, and the heavy use of  
external contractors, the legacy platform was fragile, obsolete, and  
simply unable to support the demands of the market.  
The company understood that it had to reinvest in a more modern  
platform that enabled a faster response—not only to problems, but  
also market opportunities and competitive pressures.  
For Merrill, the solution was to move from the existing legacy  
systems to a modern, microservices-based architecture.  
Many legacy companies have this problem, but it's also true that  
many of these companies do not have the skills to dig out of this hole.  
Fortunately, when Thomas recruited me to run the product  
organization, he also recruited an exceptionally strong head of  
engineering, Jeremiah Ivan, whom we had both worked with before.  
We needed a platform that not only could support the needs of our  
customers today, but could enable the necessary rapid  
experimentation and deployment of new capabilities that we knew  
would be required going forward.  
# The Need for Speed  
It's also important to note that, for Merrill, the goal of changing to a  
modern platform wasn't simply about achieving faster deployment,  
but also the ability to find and fix problems quickly.  
To underscore how important this was, I'll relate a story that could  
have had a catastrophic ending but turned out to be an inflection  
point for the transformation.  
Early one morning, we received a call from one of our biggest clients.  
The client had found a security bug in our system and was irate. The  
mistake was so significant to the client that it was threatening to  
cancel its contract with our company. Alarms went off, and the call  
escalated to my desk.  
I immediately reached out to the head of sales and the CEO and told  
them to get ready for a call from the client firm's CEO. At the same  
time, I put in a call to our VP of engineering and told him about the  
problem. In less than an hour, the engineering team had located the problem  
and implemented, tested, and then deployed a fix.  
At 10\:00 a.m., we received a second call from the client—not to  
complain but to apologize.  
“We thought there was a problem with the system,” he explained,  
“but apparently we were mistaken. So, you can forget about the call  
to your CEO. Everything is good.”  
When I relayed the client's second call to Rusty, he was relieved, but  
also excited. He'd been making investments in technology and  
people but, from his perspective, had yet to see real benefits. That  
now changed.  
“Christian,” he told me, “the new muscles within the company to  
identify and diagnose a problem are impressive. Our ability to  
resolve that problem is also impressive. But what really stands out  
for me is the fact that our engineering team was able to respond to  
our customer's needs as fast as they did.”  
Rusty was right. The importance of this fix was significant not only  
because it solved a real customer problem, but because it was  
emblematic of all the technology and process changes the company  
had been working so hard to implement. These included\:  
Changing from on-premises to a cloud-based platform  
Changing from a waterfall to an Agile delivery model  
Changing from a monolithic platform to independent  
microservices  
Changing from infrequent occasional releases to frequent, small  
releases \(CI/CD\)  
This new optimized environment increased availability while  
improving stability, with a guaranteed service-level agreement. The  
solution also reduced the company's operational costs by 30 percent.  
The new platform provided access to dashboards, and clear visibility  
of operations, and enabled detailed infrastructure and database  
monitoring for all the company's critical applications. If more capacity, new storage, or additional computing power was needed, it  
could be quickly provisioned.  
# Changing How We Solve Problems  
Very often success is determined not by our plans but by the people  
and processes we have put in place that enable us to respond to  
uncertainty and surprise.  
Rather than simply approving and funding a six-month plan and  
then blindly proceeding to execute on that plan despite everything  
that is learned during that time, we instead fund an empowered  
product team to solve a problem and equip them with the skills to be  
able to adapt and learn from the customers and the technology every  
day.  
# Collaborative Problem Solving  
Problem solving is a collaborative process. It's not the customer on  
the front lines, or the salesperson, or the all-knowing CEO.  
None of these people know what is just now possible. For this reason,  
most innovative solutions come from those working closest to the  
technology.  
But for that to happen, teams need to be informed and empowered to  
make decisions. They need a set of competencies and skills to tackle  
the risks involved when identifying and delivering a solution worth  
building.  
Top-down decision making is not only slow and cumbersome, but  
the decision is too often made far from where the critical knowledge  
of the customers and the technology resides.  
# Responding to Customer Needs  
Empowered product teams aren't concerned only with technology  
questions. They ask customer questions about users, customers and  
markets, needs and motivations. They ask business questions about  
go to market, compliance, security, privacy, costs, and monetization. More generally, if they are creating new solutions, these product  
teams want to know if people will actually buy and use them before a  
single line of code is ever written. They also want to know all the risk  
factors to ensure that the products they create don't break—that they  
don't hurt our customers, our colleagues in sales and service, our  
company's reputation, or our revenue.  
How did we empower the product teams?  
The first step was to move from funding projects to funding people  
and teams. Doing this entailed giving them problems to solve rather  
than features to build.  
We then created a safe environment in which team members knew  
they had the authority to make decisions without finger-pointing or  
micromanaging from above. We also staffed those teams with  
problem solvers—people willing to sign up to deliver business  
results.  
This was a significant part of Merrill's transformation. The company  
had to shift from its legacy project-based funding model and direct  
its budget toward problem-solving teams.  
It meant staffing new roles, such as product managers and product  
designers. It also meant moving from outsourcing engineering to  
building an engineering competency within the company.  
What these collaborative teams did was enable the company to  
discover solutions to real customer problems in ways that our  
customers loved, yet worked for our business.  
# Leveraging Joint Knowledge and Experience  
Deciding to transform to the product model doesn't automatically  
make you a better problem solver.  
That's what empowered teams bring to the game\: Smart people with  
different skills working together to solve problems that result in  
better products.  
Finally, creating empowered teams doesn't mean taking power from  
one group and handing it over to another. Instead, it means bringing together people from different areas and leveraging their joint  
knowledge and experience.  
At Merrill, one of the ways we did this was by allowing our product  
and technology people to talk with customers.  
And changing how we solved problems meant\:  
Eliminating the legacy roles of business analysts and product  
owners  
Hiring and coaching professional product managers  
Staffing a true product design competency—hiring professional  
product designers  
Moving from outsourcing engineering to building an internal  
engineering group  
Creating a “troika” model of product, design, and engineering,  
where a product manager, product designer, and engineering  
tech lead work collaboratively, with sales and marketing, on a  
solution to a problem they have been assigned  
Building a product discovery competency  
Introducing product discovery and the critical product competencies  
represented adding major new skills and muscles to the  
organization  
and required a commitment from the leadership team to work  
together to raise the skills of the organization.  
# Changing How We Decide Which Problems to  
# Solve  
When companies say that  
everything  
is important, that they have too  
many priorities, the standard excuse for not getting anything done is  
to point the finger. They say, “We have a resources problem” or “We  
have a technology problem,” when the truth is what they really have  
is a  
focus  
problem.  
Focused problem solving is the result of a compelling product vision  
and an insight-driven product strategy. The product vision should be big enough to last us several years, but  
we can change the product strategy as frequently as we like—usually  
quarterly—based on what we learn.  
# Context and Insight  
The best decisions for which opportunities to pursue or issues to  
address are informed by context and insight.  
Insights tell you  
what's  
happening. Context tells you  
why  
it's  
happening. Insights come from customers and competitors, from  
markets and industries, but, most important, from our data.  
Context comes from knowledge and experience. It applies  
perspective to the data. Combining insights and context gives you the  
full-screen picture of what is happening, why it's happening, and  
what needs to be done.  
This is what the product model is really about. The decision as to  
what opportunities we pursue is driven by the context and insights,  
not by reactionary or opportunistic business requests.  
For Merrill Corporation, this meant working from a unified product  
vision and having a well-articulated product strategy.  
We had to be clear on which customers we wanted to serve and what  
problems we wanted to solve for those customers.  
And this meant all the things we were not going to do. The result was  
divesting \(selling off\) several businesses and shutting down others,  
so that we could truly focus on the best opportunities.  
# The Results  
In 2020, Merrill Corporation rebranded itself as Datasite. The new  
identity was meant to reflect the completion of the company's  
transformation in which it divested its legacy financial printing  
business to focus on its rapidly growing, global, SaaS-based  
technology platform for the mergers and acquisitions community.  
Before the transformation, the old Merrill Corporation could take  
months if not years to decide on, build, and deliver new capabilities  
to its customers. The new Datasite is pushing the envelope to the point where it is  
introducing new value to its customers virtually every day.  
All this speed and innovation has translated to the bottom line. In  
2019, company revenue increased by more than 30 percent as it  
facilitated more than 10,000 M&A deals annually. Today, Datasite is  
not only the industry leader, but is highly admired for its culture of  
innovation. PART VIII  
# Transformation Techniques  
Now that we've discussed what it means to transform to the product  
operating model, the new product model competencies, and the new  
product model concepts, and we've shared several examples of  
companies that have successfully transformed, we are ready to  
discuss the more general topic of change management.  
In other words, what is the best way of getting from where you are  
now to where you want to go?  
Depending on the size of the organization working to transform, it  
can take anywhere from six months to two years to move to the  
product operating model, and that's assuming the company is  
serious about the transformation and it's not just theater.  
The seven chapters in this part are all about sharing the techniques  
we've found helpful for working through your transformation.  
Transformation Outcome  
We'll start with our objective. When will the transformation be  
done?  
Transformation Assessment  
It's important to start with a clear understanding of just where  
the company is today.  
We'll share with you an assessment tool we've developed that  
we use when we engage with companies to help them  
transform.  
The assessment starts with a high-level, holistic view of how  
products are produced and then dives deeper into the specific  
product model competencies, concepts, and principles.  
For each item, we'll share with you what to look for.  
Transformation Tactics Many different tactics can help you in your transformation  
journey. We have organized them into tactics that help  
establish the product model competencies, tactics that help  
establish the product model concepts, and tactics that help your  
organization learn the product model.  
Transformation Evangelism  
Next, we'll discuss the importance of consistently and  
frequently evangelizing the product model and the progress  
with the broader organization.  
Transformation Help  
Finally, how do you teach the product model to the members of  
your product teams? We'll discuss what to do in the case where  
your leaders are already experienced in the product model, and  
in the case where they have not yet worked in the product  
model. CHAPTER 28  
# Transformation Outcome  
When will your transformation work be done?  
At one level, strong product companies are continuously improving,  
so in that sense transformation is never really complete. However,  
there is one very meaningful milestone that matters.  
In the product model, one of the product model principles is that  
product teams are accountable for  
results  
. It's not enough to roll out  
new techniques. It's not enough to train your teams. It's not enough  
to produce output. Product teams must produce  
results  
.  
If a product team doesn't produce real results for your customers and  
your company, then what have you really accomplished?  
This is why it's so important when discussing transformation to the  
product model that you always frame this work as being about  
delivering real results.  
This is also why throughout this book we share so many stories of  
real innovation by companies that transformed to the product model.  
In every case, these companies simply didn't have the ability to  
generate those results without first developing these new muscles.  
This is the real reason for moving to the product model.  
So, when we talk about the outcome of transformation, we like to  
frame the discussion around results. What do you hope to be able to  
do once you transform that you can't do effectively today?  
Because you can't predict the future, you can't say what your specific  
goals are for the opportunities that present themselves in the future.  
Ultimately, most companies want to be able to identify and take  
advantage of the most promising opportunities, and to respond  
effectively to the most serious threats.  
Many companies that had earlier transformed to the product model  
were able to adapt to the challenges of the pandemic and come out stronger than ever.  
Companies that had earlier transformed to the product model were  
able to quickly learn relevant new technologies, including the new  
generative AI technologies, and solve problems for their customers in  
ways they never could before. They are now stronger than ever.  
No one can predict when a major new enabling technology will  
become available. All you can do is prepare yourself and your  
organization to be as ready as possible to deal with the threats and  
exploit the opportunities. CHAPTER 29  
# Transformation Assessment  
# Overview  
An honest and accurate assessment of the organization's current  
situation is essential to any plan to successfully transform.  
To set your expectations, an experienced product coach usually can  
assess an organization \(up to a single business unit\) in as little as one  
day. The advantage of experience is to know whom to ask, what to  
ask, and what to look for.  
But the intent of this chapter is to help you do this assessment  
yourself, even if you've never done anything like this before. In this  
case, the assessment likely will take a few days.  
Before we jump right into the assessment itself, there are some very  
important caveats\:  
# Be Realistic  
No company is perfect. In even the very best product companies, you  
can occasionally find product teams that are not working like their  
colleagues, or that have a few managers who revert to top-down,  
command-and-control leadership styles when under pressure.  
Usually, they are very aware of this situation and are working to  
correct it, but that doesn't mean that the company as a whole is not  
working in the product model.  
Too many product people are naive about this and have unrealistic  
expectations, and these people quickly lose credibility with the senior  
leaders. So, when you assess a competency or a capability, you are  
not looking for perfection—you are looking to understand the  
majority case.  
At the other extreme, it's rare to find a company that is truly terrible  
at everything. There are usually at least some pockets of good, and it's important to recognize and acknowledge those.  
# Talk to All Levels  
To get an accurate picture, it's essential to speak with people at all  
levels of the organization, from the CEO/GM down to individual  
engineers. It is remarkable how perceptions and understanding can  
vary, and also how some managers—especially middle managers—  
are so effective at obscuring information from the senior leaders.  
This is why you don't want to jump to conclusions the first time you  
hear something.  
# Look for Evidence  
It is not hard to say the right words. Look for evidence that people  
know what the words really mean and are living the reality daily. For  
most of the assessment items, there are objective measures or  
behaviors that you can observe. For example, ask to see some  
prototypes. Ask to see some OKRs \(objectives and key results\). Ask  
to see the product vision. Ask to see the product strategy. Ask to see  
some examples of their product roadmaps.  
# Look Below the Surface  
There is no single right way to do product \(see the box titled “The  
One Right Way?” in  
chapter 9  
\). Anyone who tells you otherwise is  
just  
trying to sell you their particular framework or services. If you  
visit enough strong product companies, you realize there are many  
effective ways to do product, and if you visit enough weak product  
companies, you see that there are at least as many ineffective ways.  
What you mainly care about in an assessment is whether the  
organization is practicing the product model's principles.  
When it comes to how they define roles and responsibilities to divide  
up the workload, what terms they use to refer to the product  
concepts, what specific delivery processes they have in place, and  
what their favorite discovery techniques are, these are all secondary  
considerations.  
Be Kind Finally, remember that many of the people you interact with will  
naturally fear they are being judged, especially if they are personally  
associated with some of the practices that are about to be replaced.  
It's important to emphasize that the assessment is not assessing  
individuals  
; it is assessing the  
particular model being used to  
produce products  
.  
If handled well, the assessment can help these people start thinking  
about how they can be a leader of the changes going forward. If  
handled poorly, these people may consider leaving the company, or,  
worse, not leave so they can try to sabotage the transformation.  
# High-Level Assessment  
The organizational assessment starts with a high-level overview of  
how the organization produces products today, then dives into a  
detailed review of the necessary product model competencies \(the  
different product people and their skills\) and the critical product  
model concepts \(what the product people do with those skills\).  
In the early chapters of the book, we described this holistic view for  
organizations using the product model. But here you want to look at  
how the organization currently does this work.  
# How Products Are Built and Deployed  
How often do most teams release? Do they release independently, or  
do they need to release as a single integrated package?  
If a customer encounters a critical problem, what is the mechanism  
for detecting and correcting it? What is required for the engineers to  
be able to “release with confidence?”  
1  
Who is responsible for ensuring that the new capability works  
correctly? Is this a largely automated process, or is it largely manual?  
What is the level of autonomy in the teams? In other words, how  
often do product teams complain of having to manage too many  
dependencies and interactions with too many other product teams to  
get even simple things done? Are there common complaints about the narrow responsibilities of each product team? Is there a desire  
for more end-to-end responsibility?  
When new features are deployed, are they routinely instrumented so  
that data is collected? Who is looking at that data?  
What is the perception in the organization regarding the speed,  
quality, and trustworthiness of the engineering organization?  
What is the level of technical debt? Keep in mind that everyone has  
tech debt. But is the situation severe? What are the symptoms? Is  
there a plan for addressing it? How far along are the teams?  
# How Problems Are Solved  
How is work provided to the product teams? Is it in the form of  
roadmaps of features and projects? From where do those features  
and projects originate?  
When the team gets to work on something they've been assigned,  
what is their process? What are the key roles and responsibilities?  
Who  
determines the detailed requirements, and how is that done?  
Do they generally have evidence for their decisions or just opinions?  
When and how do engineers enter the picture? Are product designers  
involved? When and how do engineers and designers participate?  
What is the role of the stakeholders in coming up with the details of  
the solution? How is the team ensuring that the solutions meet the  
needs of stakeholders?  
What level of customer interaction is involved? Are potential  
solutions tested with customers before the decision is made to build?  
If so, how is that done?  
How often are ideas killed or significantly changed? What is the  
process by which this happens? Do leaders or stakeholders need to  
approve decisions like this?  
What is the definition of success? Is it shipping a feature? Is it  
shipping that feature on time? Are there measurable outcomes  
associated with each feature? What happens if the feature ships, but  
the outcome is not achieved? What is the perception in the organization of the people on these  
teams responsible for defining and designing these features? Are  
they viewed as deeply knowledgeable of the customers and the  
business? Are they trusted?  
# How You Decide Which Problems to Solve  
Who decides what work will get done?  
Does the company have some sort of annual or quarterly planning  
process? Is the purpose to establish priorities and funding? How are  
funding decisions made? Who proposes the projects? Does the  
company fund projects or does it fund product teams—or  
individuals?  
Is there a product vision? Is there a product strategy? If so, are these  
created at the level of the organization or at the level of individual  
product teams, or at some level in between?  
If the product teams work off a product roadmap, who decides the  
items on that roadmap? Is the work coming from the sales  
organization? Is it coming from the stakeholders? Is it coming from  
the CEO?  
What is the nature of typical items on the roadmap? Are they  
features or projects? Or are they either problems to solve or  
outcomes to achieve?  
And then, how does whoever is deciding what will make the cut and  
what won't make those decisions? How do they prioritize the work?  
Are there desired business outcomes associated with the items of  
work? Who defines those desired outcomes, and how do they come  
up with the expectations?  
Does the organization track the percentage of items that deliver the  
hoped-for results?  
# The Detailed Assessment  
Now that you have a broad understanding of how the company  
produces products, it's time to look at the specific product competencies and concepts to understand just what you have to work  
with and where the specific gaps are.  
As a reminder, these product model competencies and concepts are  
described in the earlier sections of the book, so here we just discuss  
how to recognize the competencies and concepts in action.  
# Product Model Competencies  
Before looking at the individual roles, it's useful to get a sense of the  
overall size of the organization that produces the products. Get at  
least rough numbers for the total number of people in each of the  
roles.  
This sounds easy, but in many organizations—since titles are not  
standard—you'll probably need to dig a little to understand what is  
meant by each role, and then try to figure out what the mix of people  
and roles is.  
For example, many organizations have some people with the title  
“product manager,” but they also have older roles such as product  
owners, business analysts, program managers, solutions architects,  
and more.  
Yet, if you ask what is meant by the other roles, in many cases those  
other roles are doing parts of the product management job.  
Product Management  
The main thing you're looking for here is if the organization  
understands the difference between a product manager for an  
empowered product team, versus a product manager for a feature  
team, versus a product owner for a delivery team.  
You can tell this both by talking with the product managers  
themselves and by talking with those who depend on the product  
manager, such as stakeholders or engineers.  
How do the product managers spend their time? Are they in  
meetings all day? If so, what type of meetings? How much time are  
they spending on product discovery? How well do the product managers really know the customers? How  
deeply do they immerse themselves in the data? How well do they  
understand the product's go-to-market? How well do they  
understand the other dimensions of the business? How well do they  
understand the industry, competitive landscape, and relevant  
technology trends?  
What type of training have the product managers had? Have they  
been trained in the full job, or have they been trained only in a role in  
a delivery process \(e.g., Agile product owner training\)?  
How well respected are the product managers? How well do they  
collaborate with the designers and engineers? How well do they  
collaborate with stakeholders? How are these people perceived by  
the executive team?  
Are the product managers receiving coaching on a weekly basis?  
Product Design  
You're looking for three main things here\:  
First, does the organization understand what a product designer is  
and how it is different from the types of designers used by  
marketing?  
Does the organization understand service design,  
interaction design, visual design, and, in the case of devices,  
industrial design?  
Second, does the organization have enough of these true product  
designers, or are the designers jumping between several product  
teams, doing the best they can?  
Third, is the design organization set up like an in-house design  
agency, where product teams make requests of the designers, or are  
the product designers embedded in the product teams as first-class  
team members?  
Do product managers create wireframes and then hand those to the  
designer to make them pretty? When are the product designers  
brought into the process of discovering and designing a solution? Is  
it after the product manager has largely determined what she wants?  
How often are the designers creating prototypes? What types of  
prototypes? What tools do they use? How are they testing those prototypes?  
More generally, is there an experienced design manager in place who  
knows what to look for in a product designer, and who provides  
coaching to the product designers on a weekly basis?  
Engineering  
The engineering organization is normally quite large compared to the  
product managers and product designers, and you're not trying to  
assess the full organization and all the various engineering roles  
here. Your focus is on the more senior engineers who would be  
serving in the tech lead role on the product teams.  
You're looking to see if these people understand the difference  
between a senior engineer and a tech lead. In particular, you want to  
make sure these people care as much about what gets built as how it  
is built.  
Remember that it's normal for many engineers to want to focus just  
on building, but it's essential that you have at least one senior  
engineer on each product team who is willing and able to participate  
in product discovery activities.  
An excellent sign is when the tech leads have already been visiting  
real customers.  
You can learn a great deal by talking with the first-level engineering  
managers about which of their engineers are suitable, and whether  
the engineering leaders understand the importance of engineering in  
product discovery, and whether they are providing coaching to their  
tech leads on at least a weekly basis.  
Does the organization have a distinction between a senior engineer  
and a tech lead? Does it have a role that is explicitly responsible to  
help with the question of what to build and not just how to build? Is  
the tech lead an individual contributor or a people manager? If a  
people manager, how many engineers report? How often do  
engineers visit directly with users and customers? What is the level  
of interaction between the tech lead and the product manager? What  
is the proximity of the tech lead to the product manager? Is the first time the engineers hear of a product idea at sprint  
planning? What is the role of the engineers in evaluating whether  
something actually should be built or not?  
Do the engineers have “paved paths” or standards for how to  
accomplish routine tasks, make decisions, and handle specific types  
of problems?  
Are ideas introduced by engineers, especially technical innovations,  
well received and carefully considered by the product managers?  
Are the engineers responsible for the quality of their code, or do they  
hand off to QA? Do engineers fix their own bugs?  
Are any of the engineers outsourced? If so, what percentage? And  
which specific engineering roles? Are there already plans to bring  
these roles in-house?  
How are the engineers perceived? Are they simply there to build  
what people request?  
Product Leadership  
“Product leadership” refers to the managers of product management,  
product design, and engineering. Virtually every company has people  
in these roles, but the real question is, what are their specific  
responsibilities?  
You're trying to figure out if the role is set up primarily as a people  
manager, or if these leaders are deep into the coaching of their  
people and the creation of the strategic context.  
How do they define their responsibilities? Are they responsible for  
determining the direction? The measures of success?  
Do they explicitly include the strategic context \(the product vision,  
product strategy, team topology, and team objectives\)? And do they  
view it as part of their job to evangelize the strategic context? Or do  
they view themselves primarily as people managers?  
Most important, do they view coaching as one of their most  
important responsibilities? How much time do they spend each week  
on coaching? Are these leaders deeply aware of what is going on in their product  
teams without micromanaging them?  
How do the individual contributors perceive their managers? Are  
they viewed as committed to coaching? Are they deeply  
knowledgeable of the strategic context?  
# Product Model Concepts  
Now we're ready to look at the product model concepts. Keep in  
mind that companies almost always have some form of these  
concepts in place. For example, while companies that have not  
transformed rarely have empowered product teams, they do often  
have either feature teams or delivery teams. Your goal here is to  
understand the most common situation within this company or  
business unit.  
Product Teams  
The most fundamental thing to check is if the company has durable  
teams or if they still have temporary project teams. In other words,  
are they staffing project teams based on funding a particular project?  
And after that project is completed, do the people move to other  
teams?  
Assuming the company does have durable product teams, next you're  
interested in whether the teams are there just to build backlog items  
\(delivery teams\), or if they are there to deliver the requested features  
and projects on a roadmap originating from the stakeholders \(feature  
teams\), or if they are given problems to solve and empowered to  
discover and deliver an effective solution \(empowered product  
teams\).  
You also want to try to understand if the product teams have all the  
necessary cross-functional roles. This relates to the product  
competencies we assessed earlier, but now you're checking to see if  
each product team has enough people with the necessary  
competencies.  
Next, try to get a sense for the level of ownership that the people on  
the product teams feel. This is subjective, but when talking with the  
team members, do they feel a real sense of agency? Are they vested in what they are building? Do they care about the outcomes? If there's  
an issue, how do they respond?  
Finally, what level of access does the team have to customers, to the  
data, and to the stakeholders? How often are they visiting  
customers? How often do they include an engineer when they visit a  
customer? Does the product manager have good access to the various  
data tools? Does she stay on top of the latest usage data and trends?  
Product Strategy  
Product strategy is a bit of a tricky item to assess because the term  
“strategy” is used for so many different things.  
Essentially, what you want to understand is how the company  
determines the product work that needs to be done. Is there a  
multiyear product vision? Is there a quarterly or annual planning  
process that results in roadmaps for each team? Or is each product  
team asked to work with their assigned stakeholders on creating a  
roadmap? Or do the product leaders create a product strategy that  
results in the set of problems to be solve?  
Keep in mind that every company and every product team has a set  
of keep-the-lights-on items that just need to be done. These items  
are  
not what we're referring to when we are looking at the product  
strategy. We're looking for a product leader looking holistically  
across the many product teams and using data to decide the most  
critical and impactful problems to solve.  
Product Discovery  
Most companies that have not yet moved to the product model  
usually don't do any product discovery. If they do, it is usually design  
rather than discovery.  
The key to look for is how many ideas the product team is testing in  
order to come up with a solution worth building. If the number of  
ideas being tested is the same as the number of items being built,  
then this is likely design rather than discovery.  
Ideally, what you are looking for is that the product team is testing  
out a larger number of ideas but building less than half of those ideas in delivery. That tells you that the team is genuinely testing out ideas  
and discarding the ones that aren't worth pursuing further.  
You also want to determine which product risks the product team is  
considering as they do their product discovery work. Often, it is just  
feasibility, and maybe usability. You are looking for teams that are  
also assessing value and viability.  
Does the team know how to run quick experiments, both quantitative  
and qualitative? Does the team understand the techniques to test  
product ideas responsibly?  
Product Delivery  
When assessing product delivery, you want to start with how  
frequently the product team is releasing. Mainly you care that they  
are releasing no less than once every two weeks. Ideally, they are  
doing continuous deployment.  
You also want to make sure that everything that's released is  
instrumented, so that you can know if the feature is working as  
needed.  
In addition, you want to determine if the company has monitoring in  
place to detect if problems occur.  
Finally, you want to see if the team has the deployment  
infrastructure in place in order to run something like an A/B test to  
determine if a new capability is providing the expected value.  
Product Culture  
Assessing product culture is subjective but nevertheless very  
important to do.  
First, try to determine the level of formal process the company is  
following. What is the priority\: following the process or following the  
principles? Ideally, you are looking for teams that understand the  
principles and use judgment to inform how they work on particular  
items.  
Second, what is the level of trust? Is it mainly top-down, command  
and control? Or do the leaders try to push most decisions down to  
the product teams? Third, is the organization optimizing for predictability, or is it trying  
to optimize for innovation? Does the company understand the role of  
engineers in innovation? Are the engineers asked to care as much  
about what they build as how they build?  
Finally, does the company understand the necessary role of failure in  
innovation? Are people scared to do something that might fail? Also,  
does the company understand the techniques in order to fail fast and  
cheap so they don't fail in production? Innovation Theatre  
Many companies long ago lost their ability to innovate.  
But before deciding they needed to get serious about  
transformation, many of these companies tried one or both of two  
different approaches to try to rekindle growth and innovation.  
The first approach involves going shopping for innovation by  
acquiring companies. The second approach involves setting up  
some form of corporate innovation lab.  
Acquisitions are a large and important topic, and one that is  
beyond the scope of this book. However, when it comes to  
technology-powered products, it's no secret that most  
acquisitions end up being considered very expensive mistakes—  
and we're not just talking about the cost of the acquisition. We're  
referring to the ongoing cost in legacy system integration,  
technical debt, and unhappy customers.  
But the main topic here is the problem with corporate innovation  
labs. A critical principle is that a product team is responsible for  
both discovery and delivery, and one of the worst things you can  
do is break that work across two different teams.  
The most common manifestation of this problem is when a  
corporate innovation lab is responsible for product discovery, and  
the product teams are responsible only for product delivery.  
The reason it's so important that every product team is  
responsible for both discovery and delivery is that it's absolutely  
critical that the same people who discover an effective solution be  
the ones to bring that solution to market. Otherwise, the passion  
and excitement that the team feels when they engage with  
customers and the new enabling technology to solve a problem is  
lost when things are “thrown over the wall” from the team doing  
discovery to the team responsible for delivery.  
Not to mention the problem of creating two classes of product  
teams—those that innovate and those that don't. So, while it's understandable why so many companies try out  
corporate innovation labs, doing so rarely yields the hoped-for  
results.

This popular phrase refers to engineers releasing once they are  
confident that the new capability works as advertised, and does  
not cause negative unintended consequences \(regressions\). CHAPTER 30  
# Transformation Tactics—  
# Competencies  
Establishing the new product model competencies is usually one of  
the hardest parts of moving to the product model. It is also one of the  
most sensitive as you are essentially trying to get people to learn new  
skills and take on additional responsibilities.  
But establishing these competencies is usually among the first things  
to do as, without the skills, the people won't be able to succeed with  
the product concepts.  
Note that many of the techniques in this chapter are described in  
much more detail in the book  
EMPOWERED  
.  
# Product Model Competencies  
# New Job Definitions  
Please remember that just because you may have some titles that  
sound the same, the product model introduces very different job  
definitions and responsibilities.  
As a reminder, one of the top reasons for failed transformations is  
ignoring this reality and thinking you can succeed without taking the  
difficult step of resetting expectations of the people in the roles.  
Success begins by first clearly defining the jobs that are required.  
Then you can start evaluating which of your people are capable of  
succeeding in those roles. With capable coaching from their manager  
or another product coach, many can succeed. But if you don't reset  
the job expectations, you won't see a reset in behaviors or  
performance.  
It's also important to note that there may be job definitions from  
outside  
of product and engineering that are impacted as well, depending on the org structure. If you find that moving to the  
product model impacts critical roles elsewhere in the company,  
consider expanding this work to include those roles.  
Job Reset  
Occasionally, one or more of the product model competencies  
requires a true reset in the organization. This is usually the case  
where the company had been using the same title, such as “product  
manager” or “product designer,” but it had simply retitled previous  
product owners or graphic designers.  
When this is the situation, it's important for the company not just to  
set a high bar, but also to clearly message the rest of the company  
that the role has changed very intentionally.  
When you redefine this role, it's important to do so consistently. For  
example, you might temporarily rename all your current product  
managers “product analysts” or “product specialists.” Then, as  
people interview for the newly defined product manager role, or as  
they get trained in the new role, you are careful to use only the new  
“product  
manager” title if the person has demonstrated that they are  
capable of succeeding in the new role.  
# Role Balancing  
To get the most value out of your staff, you will need to have the right  
balance of product managers, product designers, and engineers. It's  
not unusual that when a company moves to the product model, they  
are initially out of balance. Role balancing is related to the team  
topology discussion in  
chapter 31  
.  
It's common that when moving to the product model, the company  
ends up needing fewer but much stronger product managers, a larger  
number of more broadly skilled product designers, and a strong set  
of engineering tech leads. And the product leaders often have a very  
steep learning curve because they have much different roles in the  
product model.  
Experienced product teams typically have one product manager, one  
product designer, and somewhere between two and ten engineers,  
while a platform team typically has one \(quite technical\) product manager, and between four and twenty engineers. Those are wide  
ranges of engineers because there are many different considerations.  
Just keep in mind it is usually better to have a smaller number of  
somewhat larger teams than a large number of small teams.  
Dealing with Too Few Designers  
One common problem is that the assessment shows you have too few  
product designers. While you are working to hire more, in the  
interim there are several choices for how to deal with the shortage.  
The first option is to triage the product teams and assign a product  
designer to only those product teams most in need of design help.  
The second option is to hire contract product designers to work on a  
team until a permanent replacement is found. Note that these would  
be freelancer hires for some number of months, not tied to projects.  
The third option is to ask product designers to cover multiple  
product teams simultaneously. Note that the contribution of the  
designer drops off dramatically when split between more than two  
teams.  
None of these options is ideal, and none is sustainable, but they can  
all help you for a few months.  
Dealing with Outsourced Engineers  
Moving to the product model absolutely requires insourcing your  
engineers. We mean this very seriously\: Just as you wouldn't  
outsource your CEO, you wouldn't outsource your key engineers.  
That said, insourcing can take some real time. The most important  
person to insource on each product team is the tech lead. That  
should be done immediately. In fact, you don't have a product team  
unless you have a tech lead. Once you have that tech lead, that  
person can coordinate and communicate with the other engineers,  
even if some of them are still outsourced.  
But you will learn that a smaller number of insourced engineers will  
consistently outperform a much larger number of outsourced  
engineers. This is why insourcing almost always results in cost  
savings in addition to dramatically improved levels of innovation. All that said, while it will take time, the truth is that if your  
organization isn't serious about insourcing your engineering, it's not  
serious about transformation to the product model.  
Raising Engagement Level of Engineers  
When moving to the product model, sometimes the engineers have  
been treated as mercenaries for so long that the ones who remain are  
perfectly comfortable in that model, and say they have little desire to  
participate in activities such as product discovery.  
But you need to make sure that at least the tech lead does care about  
what you are building. The responsibilities regarding product  
discovery should be explicitly in the tech lead job description.  
More generally, the best way to engage engineers is to bring the  
engineers along when visiting customers. It is remarkable the impact  
that can have.  
Product Managers and Line-of-Business Managers  
In certain situations, the product manager needs to partner closely  
with another person in the company with a similar-sounding job.  
For example, suppose you are a product manager for an online  
banking digital experience, but a different person is product manager  
for the actual financial bank accounts \(savings and checking\). Or,  
suppose you're the product manager for an e-commerce experience,  
but a different person is a category manager for a class of  
merchandise, such as electronics. Or, suppose you are the product  
manager for a digital experience for media and news, but another  
person is the editor for the content itself.  
In each of these cases, the product manager will need to have an  
especially strong relationship with these line-of-business  
counterparts. The good news is that there is a great deal of work to  
do, and it's not hard to split the work up in a way that makes sense.  
Normally, the product manager on the product team is responsible  
for the holistic digital or omnichannel experience, and the other  
person has responsibility for the underlying content or service.  
There is, however, one thing you must always watch out for.  
Sometimes the business counterpart wants to continue to make all the real product decisions, as they likely did in the past. What they  
ideally want from product managers is that they step back to more of  
an order-taker product owner role, much like a business analyst. This  
would essentially be abandoning the move to the product model, as  
you're right back to stakeholder-driven roadmaps.  
That said, sometimes the reason the business counterpart feels this  
way is because the particular product manager simply doesn't have  
the ability to do the necessary job. For companies that don't take  
seriously the new product management competency, this is all too  
common. In such cases, it actually may make the most sense to  
consider  
having the business counterpart take on the product  
manager role, assuming they are willing and able to be coached in  
the new skills required for this demanding role.  
# New Recruiting Practices  
One advantage of moving to the product model is that your company  
becomes much more attractive to the type of candidates you need to  
hire.  
But in addition to new job descriptions, you'll need to be sure to set  
up suitable interview teams that both know what to look for in a  
candidate and understand what the candidate is assessing.  
Also, it's important to emphasize that if you want to succeed with  
recruiting the right type of people, the hiring manager is going to  
need to step up and take ownership of recruiting. HR can help a little  
bit, but if the hiring manager thinks that HR can recruit for them,  
she is unfortunately about to learn why they can't.  
# Assessments and Coaching Plans  
Once you have the right people in the right spots, you will want to  
immediately assess each person against the skills required to succeed  
in the job. Doing this allows you to identify the gaps and create a  
coaching plan for each person.  
Onboarding Programs A major part of transformation includes education. It's one thing to  
read a book or attend a workshop, but it's another thing altogether to  
learn hands-on what all these techniques are really about.  
There are many ways to educate your product teams and your  
product leaders, but one favorite and scalable way is by creating a  
product model onboarding program.  
Ideally, product teams attend this program together, often including  
their key stakeholders at relevant moments during the program. CHAPTER 31  
# Transformation Tactics—Concepts  
Once the new product model competencies have been established,  
people are ready to start using their skills to work on the product  
concepts.  
It's important to recognize that skills like product strategy and  
product discovery can always be improved. There are always new,  
emerging techniques and tools, and good product companies are  
always working to improve.  
So, when you work on transformation tactics, you're not aiming for  
perfection or even excellence; you're aiming for competence, and  
then through ongoing coaching, you help your people continue to  
learn and develop.  
Note that many of the techniques in this chapter are described in  
much more detail in the book  
EMPOWERED  
.  
# Product Teams  
# Team Chemistry  
Even if every member of the product team has strong skills, this does  
not mean that the product team as a whole will work together well.  
Sometimes, there are personality clashes or other problems. It's  
important for product leaders to assess the overall chemistry of each  
team and either coach or shuffle people to get the teams to operate  
together effectively.  
# Team Durability  
Many companies coming from prior models are used to shuffling  
people between product teams on an as-needed basis, especially  
engineers. However, in the product model, while there certainly will  
be some cases where moving a person temporarily or longer is warranted, such moves are only done judiciously and after careful  
consideration of unintended consequences—especially given the level  
of effort product leaders put into coaching the necessary  
psychological safety and chemistry discussed above.  
# Review Team Topology  
“Team topology” refers to how the product teams are structured—  
especially what each team is responsible for. You can think of it as\:  
How do you slice up the pie?  
Occasionally, a company will not yet have a team topology—meaning  
it has not yet created durable product teams of any sort. This usually  
happens with organizations that are still very project based. In this  
case, transformation to the product model begins with the very  
foundational move to durable, cross-functional product teams.  
However, most organizations have some team topology already in  
place when they begin a transformation effort.  
Sometimes that topology is already pretty reasonable, and the issue  
is more about how the teams work and interact. But often the  
topology is more historical, and there are serious symptoms around  
long lists of dependencies, a resulting lack of autonomy and sense of  
ownership, and, in many cases, serious morale issues because people  
feel like small cogs in a giant machine.  
And even if the company didn't have these symptoms, the team  
topology is a function of the longer-term product vision and the  
ongoing product strategy. So, if the company did not have that  
product vision, then almost certainly the team topology is not set up  
to help the company achieve that vision.  
Changing a team topology is very disruptive, so it's important not to  
do this casually or frequently, but the start of a transformation effort  
is usually a good time.  
The key is to make sure, first, that you have your product vision \(see  
“Create Product Vision” later in the chapter\) and then that  
both  
your  
product and engineering leaders come up with the new topology  
together  
. We emphasize this not because we want to sound inclusive. The issue  
is that the appropriate team topology is essentially a balance of the  
needs of engineering and architecture, with customers and business  
objectives. We need to solve for both sets of goals, and one of the  
most common problems is that just one or the other drives the  
topology.  
There are many considerations in coming up with an effective team  
topology, but it's also important to keep in mind that no topology is  
perfect, as they are necessarily based on a set of competing goals and  
compromises.  
One situation to watch out for is that many companies ready to  
transform have too many small product teams. Often we suggest that  
the companies adjust to a smaller number of larger-scope teams. It is  
remarkable how much better the organization can perform, and how  
much morale can improve, where there are fewer dependencies,  
more end-to-end responsibility, and, overall, a stronger feeling of  
sense of ownership and empowerment.  
# Dealing with Distributed Teams and Remote  
# Employees  
When it comes to the geographical location of the various members  
of your product teams, there are of course many considerations.  
What is important for transformation purposes is that while product  
delivery can work quite well when members are dispersed, it is a  
much different situation with product discovery. That's because  
product discovery depends on very close collaboration among  
product manager, product designer, and tech lead, which is much  
easier when they are colocated.  
Which is to say, when you are deciding whom to put on which  
product teams, the team will benefit if you can colocate these key  
roles, even if for only two to three days per week.  
# Product Delivery  
There is a very wide range of activities included in product delivery,  
and depending on the current state, the list of areas needing investment may be long—including such items as tech debt,  
implementing CI/CD, DevOps, test and release automation,  
instrumentation, monitoring, A/B testing infrastructure, and more.  
Usually, all it takes is one senior engineer who has already worked  
this way joining the team to show other team members what is  
necessary.  
Even if a specific team doesn't have an engineer who has already  
moved to this model, often another engineer on a different team has.  
In this case, you may ask that engineer to first help their current  
team become an example for the rest of the organization. Then that  
engineer will spend the next several months helping other teams  
through the changes. As you might imagine, such an engineer quickly  
becomes quite valuable to the organization.  
A large amount of work may be involved with architecture, tooling,  
infrastructure, test and release automation, and more, so it's  
important to realize that these changes do not all have to be made at  
once. But these these infrastructure changes are a prerequisite to the  
product operating model, both in properly taking care of customers,  
and in holding yourselves accountable to outcomes.  
If the level of technical debt is getting in the way of the product  
delivery work, see the box titled “Managing Technical Debt” in  
chapter 18  
.  
# Product Discovery  
Many feature teams consider the work they do to come up with the  
product backlog as product discovery. And there is a little bit of truth  
to that. But since feature teams don't specifically tackle value and  
viability risks, and they rarely actually test their product ideas, other  
than perhaps performing an occasional usability test, their work  
would more accurately be considered product definition, not product  
discovery.  
But what's important is to make sure that, going forward, product  
teams know that they need to address  
all  
product risks.  
This is often a large mental shift for product teams, and especially for  
product managers. In fact, it's not unusual for some new product managers to resist the responsibility that comes along with being  
accountable for value and viability. Coaching is critical to help people  
through this change.  
# Driving Up Customer Interaction  
Many companies that have yet to transform have very little actual  
interaction with their customers, and correcting that is among the  
first things you need to fix.  
Consider telling each product team with a user-facing experience—  
customer-facing or employee-facing—that they need to start one-  
hour product discovery sessions three times per week, every week.  
Note that this is not just in “discovery phase,” or when there's time.  
This is the heart of the product manager's and product designer's  
regular day job.  
The teams likely will need the coordination help of one of the user  
researchers, but they need to get into the rhythm of interviewing or  
testing their product ideas with real users every week.  
For some companies, just clearing away the obstacles and excuses to  
continuous testing represents a major milestone, and a true turning  
point in their transformation.  
In  
part X  
,  
Overcoming Objections  
, we discuss many of the most  
common excuses you will hear from people trying to explain why this  
frequent customer interaction would be too hard. It's not. And it is  
essential to consistent innovation.  
# Discovery Sprints  
Another very effective way of quickly learning the techniques of  
product discovery is to hold an intense, one-week  
discovery sprint  
\(aka  
design sprint  
\). This is a great way to build trust within the  
product team; learn the mindset, principles, and techniques of  
product discovery; and accomplish something very meaningful in a  
short period of time.  
Again, you can lead these discovery sprints yourself, or you can get a  
discovery coach to facilitate. Hack Days  
A great way to engage engineers in product discovery, and to ramp  
up prototyping in general, is with  
hack days  
. These can be either  
directed \(everyone is working to try to solve the same problem\) or  
undirected \(work on anything related to the product vision\). More on  
this under the section titled “Product Culture” later in the chapter.  
# Product Strategy  
The  
input  
to a product strategy is the product vision and the  
company objectives, and the  
result  
of a product strategy is a set of  
problems  
to solve, which are then assigned to product teams as team  
objectives \(usually in the form of objectives and key results \[OKRs\]\).  
Since the primary purpose of the product vision and product strategy  
is to share with the product teams and the stakeholders, it's  
important that the vision and strategy be in a form that is  
transparent and easily shareable.  
It is also important to emphasize that many companies moving to the  
product model may not yet have a product vision or strategy, but  
they almost always have some form of company planning cycle that  
ultimately decides which projects to staff and fund. If it's not already  
clear to the company leaders, it can be useful to highlight the  
differences in the techniques. Both start with company objectives,  
and both finish with prioritized work. But the mechanisms are very  
different.  
# Create Product Vision  
In the vast majority of transformations, the product organization  
does not currently have a product vision. It might have an artifact it  
calls a product vision, but that is usually just a simple mission  
statement, which does not serve the purpose of a product vision.  
Realize that if the company was set up with feature teams, then it is  
very unlikely that there was any unifying vision at play—as feature  
teams are all about serving the needs of their particular stakeholders. It's possible, although unlikely, that one or more of the stakeholders  
had their own product vision. More likely, they were simply doing  
their best to run their part of the business. This is why usually the  
transformation effort is what inspires an organization to create its  
first product vision.  
There are many benefits to creating a compelling and inspiring  
product vision. The good news is that you put the effort into crafting  
a strong product vision once, and that vision then provides benefits  
to the entire company for several years \(usually three to ten\).  
Product vision is also something where experienced product  
leadership coaches can be a real help, and firms that specialize in  
helping you craft a product vision also exist.  
# Create Product Strategy  
For the same reasons most companies beginning a transformation  
don't have a product vision, they rarely have a product strategy.  
More important, they usually don't have the muscles in place to  
create ongoing, insight-driven product strategies.  
So, it is very common for product leaders to need to put in place the  
mechanisms to make hard decisions pertaining to focus and to  
gather insights from data, customer interactions, the industry, and  
enabling technologies.  
This is often the first time the product leaders have been asked to  
produce this type of work, and those leaders will be judged on the  
quality of their recommendations in their product strategy. Product  
leaders who have never before done this work often enlist the help of  
a product leadership coach for this reason.  
# Portfolio Management  
One very common problem when transforming is that there is a very  
large set of existing legacy systems and not nearly enough people to  
care for them properly.  
In such situations, we recommend doing a portfolio review. This  
means creating an inventory of all the various systems and  
components and then putting each one into one of three states. For any systems you can possibly  
sunset  
\(stop supporting\), you  
should absolutely do so. You may need to generate some analytics  
showing the actual usage level of this system, and you may also need  
to calculate an estimate of the ongoing maintenance cost, but  
everything you can sunset will reduce both the ongoing load and the  
number of systems that require replatforming.  
Next, likely many systems are important to keep running, but they do  
not warrant continued investment beyond keeping them running.  
We call this state  
sustaining  
. The benefit of sustaining as many  
systems as possible is to free up most \(but not all\) of the people who  
are working on those systems to be able to work on the critical areas  
of investment.  
Finally, the third category is  
invest  
, which is where you are placing  
your new bets going forward. These are the systems you want to staff  
fully.  
This portfolio review exercise is usually painful, but it is essential if  
you want to be able to staff your investment areas appropriately.  
# Funding Product Teams  
If you are coming to the product model from one of the project-based  
models, it's very possible your organization is used to funding  
projects, and now you need to change to funding product teams.  
We talk about the larger change in  
chapter 24  
, “Partnering with  
Finance,” but there is a relatively simple technique for making the  
necessary change without disrupting much of how your finance  
organization works.  
In the old, project-based model, you would propose a business case  
for a project, and then finance or the senior executive team would  
decide if they wanted to fund that project.  
You can continue with essentially the same general funding model,  
but instead of putting a business case together for a project to deliver  
some output in some number of months, you would put the business  
case together for a product team to deliver some outcome for some  
number of  
quarters  
. Finance usually prefers this because the  
product team is told to focus on some set of business results, which are much more meaningful to finance than the fact of shipping a  
feature.  
# Implement Team Objectives  
The result of a strong product strategy is a prioritized set of critical  
problems to be solved, sometimes characterized as bets. Now you  
need to assign those problems to the appropriate product teams.  
Most companies use the OKR technique for assigning these problems  
to teams, as that's what the technique was created for. If you've never  
used this technique, or if you tried to use it but failed because you  
tried to apply it in the context of feature teams, again, you may want  
to get some help.  
Product leadership coaches can help with team objectives, or  
specialized OKR coaches can be hired. The key to using an OKR  
coach is to make sure she has real experience doing objectives in the  
product model. Many OKR implementations focus on sales and  
marketing organizations, which have very different considerations.  
# Product Vision or Strategy Sprints  
Product vision sprints  
and/or  
product strategy sprints  
are ways for  
product leaders to dive deep into a facilitated week of product vision  
and/or product strategy.  
The idea is to get the right people together, with the right prep work  
done beforehand, and then to have a very intense offsite-style  
collaborative meeting to accomplish in a week what would otherwise  
potentially take much longer.  
These sessions can be facilitated by an experienced product coach or  
by a specialty firm.  
# Product Culture  
Depending on the results of the organization assessment, the cultural  
issues are usually the most subjective and the slowest to change. It is  
not hard to say the right things, but people see what the leaders do,  
especially under stress. The key is to realize that there will be mistakes and setbacks. But if  
you can consistently show visible examples of cultural change, over  
time, people will come to believe it's real.  
This point relates directly to the transformation evangelism  
discussed in  
chapter 33  
.  
Many techniques can help build the cultural practices and norms  
that the product model depends on. Here we discuss some of our  
favorites.  
# Hack Days  
Getting your engineers and, more broadly, the product teams  
engaged not just in building solutions, but in coming up with  
innovative solutions to the problems you are trying to solve, is one of  
your most important cultural goals.  
There are many variations of hack days—directed or undirected,  
monthly or quarterly, data centered, self-organized or product team  
based—but the higher-order goal is just to get started and evolve  
based on the response.  
# Customer Engagement  
How many customer engagements occurred in the past quarter? Has  
this number grown from the prior quarter? If not, why not?  
What were the major insights from those engagements?  
How well has the organization continued to increase its level of  
customer knowledge and share what it has learned?  
How much has this knowledge spread throughout the product  
teams? To the engineers?  
# Innovation Accounting  
How many ideas were tested in the last quarter? Has the number  
increased significantly from the prior quarter? If not, why not?  
What role has new enabling technology played in this innovation?  
What role have data insights played in this innovation? Note that these metrics on ideas and tests can be informative, and  
help indicate where additional coaching may be required, but they  
should not be confused with business results.  
# Culture Retrospectives  
There are many forms of retrospectives, but at least every quarter it  
is a good idea to get some of your most progressive product, design,  
and engineering leaders together to discuss how they think the  
organization managed to do its work the preceding quarter, and what  
they think should be the emphasis for the next quarter.  
They would normally look at topics such as\:  
The level of process versus the understanding of the principles  
How much was still top-down command and control, and how  
much was pushed down to the product teams  
The level of experimentation in discovery versus products that  
failed after delivery  
The level of innovation in the ideas that were explored, and the  
contribution of the engineers to that innovation  
The degree to which members of product teams understand the  
strategic context and the product model  
The level of trust between the product teams and the various  
stakeholders and executives  
The organization's ability to deliver on its high-integrity  
commitments CHAPTER 32  
# Transformation Tactics—Adoption  
In this chapter, we discuss a different aspect of transforming how  
you work\: adoption. No matter what the technique, sometimes you  
want to be intentional about how you introduce that technique to the  
organization.  
It's important to point out that these various transformation tactics  
for adoption are not mutually exclusive. In fact, it's common to blend  
them based on your circumstances.  
Any number of factors can influence your specific choice of adoption  
tactics\:  
The relative importance of the specific new capabilities  
The particular people available to participate  
The availability of product coaches or experienced product  
leaders  
The window of time available for transformation  
The current demands of the business  
The number of existing commitments  
Dependencies on other teams or systems  
Ongoing architectural changes  
Countless other possible factors  
# Pilot Teams  
The most basic technique is to begin by starting with one or more  
specific product teams, or a subset of the business unit, with the goal  
of expanding to the broader organization over time. This method is  
referred to as  
pilot teams  
or  
pilot organizations  
. Some companies—usually those that have a very strong sense of  
urgency to transform—attempt to do everything at once.  
This can work, but the problem is that there will almost certainly be  
collateral damage.  
An important concept from the product world very much applies to  
transformations as well.  
It's really a question of how fast people can adopt change  
.  
Some people love change \(early adopters\). Most people don't love it,  
but once the kinks are worked out, they are fine with the changes  
\(early and late majority\). And then there is always a subset of people  
who hate change no matter what it is \(laggards\).  
This concept is important for your product work because when you  
deploy changes, not everyone can digest those changes at the same  
pace.  
But this concept plays a major role in transformations as well  
because, after all, your organization is made up of people, and you  
are about to make big, disruptive changes to these people.  
If you thrust these changes on the organization all at once, then some  
people will be fine, but most will not be happy.  
And it's important to realize this is true largely independent of what  
the changes are. This behavior plays out even in cases where the  
people in question have been begging for the changes. They may  
indeed want the changes, but they want them in a way they can  
digest.  
One effective transformation strategy is to focus on helping the  
organization absorb the changes using pilot teams.  
Pilot teams  
are product teams \(and their associated product leaders  
and stakeholders\) that have volunteered to be on the leading edge of  
these changes. They want to be the first to try out this new way of  
working. They understand that they'll be the ones running into the  
problems, and they'll be the ones who will need to figure out ways  
around the obstacles.  
It's important that we do whatever we can to set these teams up to  
succeed. For example, we would not want a pilot team that does not have  
competent, skilled people covering each of the product model  
competencies  
. Similarly, we would not want to pick a team whose  
key stakeholders are not also eager to make the change a success.  
The main benefit of pilot teams is that the rest of the organization  
doesn't have to deal with all these changes, especially when the kinks  
are still being worked out. They can watch from the sidelines and  
have time to get used to these ideas.  
Large organizations \(enterprises composed of multiple business  
units\) often do the same thing with business units. One of the  
business units volunteers to try out the changes, and if things go  
well, the changes spread to other business units. If things do not go  
well, the testing and iteration is contained in one business unit  
unless and until it gets things working.  
In general, when using pilot teams, it's better to go deeper with a  
smaller number of pilot product teams than it is to go shallow with a  
wider number of teams.  
# Product Model Dimensions  
In large companies, often the immediate needs of different parts of  
the product organization have different priorities. In these cases, it  
can be helpful to consider the three different dimensions of the  
product model\:  
Changing how you build  
Changing how you solve problems  
Changing how you decide which problems to solve  
When you're balancing different priorities, a second very common  
transformation strategy is to start by having different groups or  
teams deploy a  
subset  
of the product model.  
There are any number of ways of defining the various subsets, but  
one way that is particularly effective is to define the subsets by the  
three different dimensions\: One group might just focus on changing how you build \(product  
delivery\).  
Another group might focus on changing how you solve problems  
\(product discovery\).  
And a third group might focus on changing how you decide  
which problems to solve \(product strategy\).  
This method allows each of the three groups to focus on the relevant  
product model concepts.  
Working on changing how you build is usually fairly independent of  
changing how you solve problems and changing how you decide  
which problems to solve, but the latter two dimensions are  
interrelated. Product strategy generates problems to solve, and you  
use product discovery to solve those problems.  
But what do you do if you want to work on changing how you solve  
problems before you tackle changing how you decide which problems  
to solve?  
In this situation, there's a technique that can be used in any  
organization to convert a conventional product roadmap into  
problems to solve with desired outcomes. These are called  
outcome-  
based roadmaps  
\(described in  
chapter 8  
\), and they are often used as  
a transition tool as companies move to the product model by starting  
with changing how they solve problems.  
# Top Down and Bottom Up  
You have probably already noticed that many of the changes apply to  
product teams, and other changes apply to product leaders.  
Here is another good way to naturally divide up the work\:  
One product coach or leader focuses on developing the skills of the  
product teams \(bottom up\), and another focuses on developing the  
skills of the product leaders and the strategic context \(top down\).  
Coaching Stakeholders In some companies, a major driving factor is the  
product/stakeholder interaction, and each side needs to be coached  
to work effectively with the other.  
In this case, you might have one product coach or product leader  
focus on the product teams and another product coach or product  
leader focus on the stakeholders.  
You seek stakeholders who are very eager to test out the product  
model and have strong credibility in the organization. Those  
stakeholders would serve as transformation sponsors. The product  
team or teams that work closely with that stakeholder would work  
together as a unit to test out the changes.  
The emphasis here is on effective collaboration, where the product  
teams and the stakeholders learn much more about each other and  
what they each can bring to the table—letting this serve as an  
example to the broader organization.  
As such, it's helpful to select efforts where an effective solution that  
solves for all parties is not obvious and will require real give-and-  
take to identify.  
# Stakeholder Briefings  
A technique related to coaching stakeholders is to hold a separate  
briefing on the product model just for interested stakeholders where  
you go deeper into common objections and confusions and give the  
stakeholders a safe place to raise concerns and work through difficult  
topics.  
# Managing Existing Commitments  
In most organizations, transformations don't just start with a clean  
slate. Very likely there exist a number of commitments that still need  
to be fulfilled.  
Certainly, you hope the product leaders will go through the list of  
existing commitments carefully and creatively to try to reduce the list  
as much as possible. If there are other ways of satisfying the customer, it probably makes sense to do that. However, likely some  
commitments remain.  
In this case, there are a couple of options.  
The most common approach is that some subset of product teams is  
identified to deliver on these existing commitments before the teams  
are ready to transform.  
The downside of this technique is that for some number of months,  
you have a potentially large subset of the organization running one  
way \(very project based\) and the rest another \(product based\). And if  
the existing commitments can't be delivered quickly, then team  
morale can suffer.  
The alternative is that each product team could have some number of  
preexisting commitments as well as their own new product work.  
The advantage to this technique is that it feels more equitable to the  
various teams. The disadvantage is that it is very hard to do both  
simultaneously, and likely this choice will delay both delivering those  
commitments and also the date everyone can get to the new model.  
Note that these existing commitments are not to be confused with  
ongoing keep-the-lights-on work. Every team has those items, both  
before and after transforming. CHAPTER 33  
# Transformation Evangelism  
Once you've done an assessment and have a good understanding of  
the various tactics you might use to transform the product model, we  
encourage companies to create a transformation plan. We hope you  
will write this plan down, and have a very clear owner of making the  
plan happen.  
# The Transformation Plan  
Ultimately, the transformation plan will represent a good deal of  
work.  
And as with any such enumeration of work, it will be important to  
assign ownership and accountability to each item of work. There's  
nothing wrong with having several people working together on any  
given task, or the entire effort, but in most company cultures,  
without ownership and accountability, you get little in the way of  
results.  
Now that you have a plan to transform your organization, you need  
to execute on that plan.  
This effort will need to continue for a significant period of time—  
usually somewhere between six months and two years—and it is very  
easy for an organization to lose focus or interest. You will need to  
work hard to avoid that.  
# Note on Task Ownership  
As with most difficult efforts, the key is to have named owners who  
are responsible and accountable for specific transformation work.  
Similarly, it's key to have a named senior product leader who takes  
real ownership of this overall transformation plan—tracking and  
reporting progress. Please don't make the mistake of thinking that a committee is the  
way to make progress on any large and difficult project. Identify  
owners, empower them, then hold them accountable.  
# Continuous Evangelism  
Transforming to the product model really does require continuous  
evangelism.  
Product leaders will need to frequently and continuously spend time  
with product teams, other product leaders, stakeholders, executives,  
and especially those who have objections or resistance, reminding  
everyone of the product model, the strategic context \(especially the  
product vision and product strategy\), and the areas of progress.  
# The Value of Quick Wins  
There's no question that transformation is a long game. For that  
reason, it is very helpful for you to have some quick wins.  
Here are some good examples of milestones worth evangelizing and  
celebrating\:  
A team that was releasing monthly achieves consistent two-week  
releases in delivery.  
A team identified, fixed, tested, and deployed a critical fix for a  
key customer in record time.  
A team decides to kill a popular product idea early in the process  
based on learnings from an inexpensive experiment.  
A team that has never visited with customers starts doing so and  
shares its experiences and insights.  
A team uncovers a big insight—positive or negative—from its  
product discovery work.  
A team that's struggled with dozens of competing priorities now  
has a single clear problem to solve, and measure of success.  
A team comes up with a truly innovative solution to a tough  
problem. A team achieves an important business result.  
A new compelling product vision has been created and shared  
with the organization.  
The first insight-driven product strategy is shared.  
A well-respected stakeholder shares positive experiences  
collaborating with a product team.  
Be sure that whenever these kinds of milestones happen, people in  
the organization immediately notify the owner of the transformation  
plan and they are added to the monthly update.  
# Constantly Beat the Drum  
The key is a constant drumbeat of transformation evangelism  
progress.  
Be sure you show the organization and its leaders and stakeholders  
the progress that has been made no less than once a month.  
And of course, for that to go well, you'll need to make sure there is  
real progress to report.  
It's hard to emphasize how important it is to keep the drum beating  
.  
As soon as you have a single product team demonstrating real  
results, make sure every other product team sees those results.  
Celebrate the accomplishments along the way. Show the other teams  
what is possible. Transformation Setbacks  
As difficult as it is to successfully transform to the product model,  
several companies that have managed to succeed and enjoyed  
remarkable financial rewards have not always been able to hold  
onto their progress.  
These are a few examples to look out for.  
The CEO or Key Product Leader Leaves  
Eventually the CEO moves on. Of course, the board needs to  
select a new CEO. But in too many cases, these boards seem to  
completely forget where they were before they transformed, and  
they recruit a new CEO who has absolutely no idea how to run a  
product company. That person proceeds to destroy literally years  
of work in just a matter of months.  
Or, a key product leader moves on, and the credibility of the new  
model was tied to that person and not to the model. When a new  
person comes in, they don't inherit the credibility and regression  
can occur.  
Usually, by the time the product organization realizes what has  
happened, the damage has already been done.  
This illustrates why it is so important to keep your board of  
directors  
fully  
informed on the product model transformation  
and make sure they realize that the financial rewards the  
company has enjoyed are a direct result of the transformation.  
Scaling Across Company  
Once the initial business units have transformed, the company  
may decide to transform the remaining business units. Each of  
these transformations is hard and sometimes, as time goes on,  
the whole model gets watered down because the people leading  
the transformation are just going through the motions.  
The main thing to keep in mind here is to do a fresh assessment  
with each new business unit. While there will be similarities, it is the differences that are important to understand. Also realize that  
the level of motivation may be different. Usually, the motivation  
is highest with the first business unit, which is why it wanted to  
be the first. But in any case, remember the critical role of the  
leader of the business unit.  
The PMO Returns  
Even in organizations that are thriving in the product model,  
often executives still miss the days of command and control. If  
one of those executives gets promoted, many times the first thing  
they do is resurrect the old-style PMO, and slowly but surely the  
old culture creeps back in.  
If you've ever seen how hard Amazon works to make sure it  
continues to behave as a “Day 1” company and take every  
precaution to avoid becoming a “Day 2” company, this is what  
Amazon is worried about.  
Business Climate Changes  
During challenging business environments, some leaders may  
want to grab the steering wheel back. Or the opposite situation\: If  
a life-or-death business event motivated the successful  
transformation, once that threat has passed and the business  
stabilizes, there may be some desire to get everything back under  
control.  
During the pandemic, a number of companies showed what they  
were capable of and achieved remarkable results. But afterward,  
without the pressure of a crisis, companies had a harder time  
keeping people from reverting back to old behaviors.  
Likely it will be up to the CEO or business unit leader to keep  
everyone focused on the principles of the product model and not  
regress to the comfort of the past. CHAPTER 34  
# Transformation Help  
Please note\: We realize that what follows runs the very real risk of  
sounding self-serving, as at SVPG we are essentially product  
coaches as well. However, we are literally only a few people, and  
odds are we don't have the bandwidth to help you even if you  
wanted us to. Mostly what we do is refer companies to product  
coaches whom we know and trust. We don't charge companies  
anything for these referrals, and we don't accept kickbacks from  
any product coaches whom we refer. We simply want you to be able  
to trust that when we refer someone to you, they know what they're  
doing  
.  
How does a company that has never worked in a new way learn that  
new way of working?  
The most important thing to realize is that your company depends on  
building products that your customers want to buy. And your  
products are created by your product leaders and product teams.  
To transform, your product leaders and the people on your product  
teams need to learn new ways of working  
.  
While training and books can help \(if the trainers and authors know  
what they're talking about\), it is never sufficient.  
In this chapter, we discuss the different approaches to getting help,  
and we also share with you the profiles of several very strong product  
coaches so that you will know the type of person to look for.  
In the best product companies, the way product managers, product  
designers, and engineers learn their craft is from their managers.  
# Managers as Coaches  
The legendary coach Bill Campbell was famous for saying  
“Coaching  
is no longer a specialty; you cannot be a good manager without  
being a good coach.” This is why, at the best product model companies, the number-one  
attribute of strong managers is that they are considered good  
coaches.  
But what to do when your managers have never worked this way?  
One solution is to hire senior product leaders \(especially leaders of  
product management, product design, and engineering\) who have  
already worked in this model, and then they can lead by example.  
This method is very effective and is one of the most common paths to  
a successful transformation. \(This is what happened in the two  
transformation stories you've read so far.\)  
However, often this is not enough for two reasons\:  
First, in many cases, the company has some number of senior leaders  
who have never worked this way before.  
Second, even if the leaders do have the experience, they simply may  
not have the time to lead the organization as well as personally coach  
all the people who need coaching.  
In these cases, an external product coach can be the difference  
between success and failure.  
# In-House Product Coaches  
For larger companies, it may make sense to hire one or more in-  
house product coaches.  
Normally, product coaches are temporary—there to help you with a  
specific product team, or set of product teams, or for the duration of  
your transformation. But some companies like to retain one or more  
product coaching staff indefinitely.  
Remember that the best solution for ongoing coaching is staffing  
these management positions with people who can effectively coach  
your individual contributor product managers, product designers,  
and engineers.  
But even then, it can make sense to have one or more specialists  
available to focus on sharing best practices and helping with training  
and onboarding of new team members. Just be very careful here to ensure that only skilled professionals are  
in this role. Again, this should be obvious, but it is remarkable how  
many companies put people in these in-house coaching roles who  
don't have necessary skills and instead just end up institutionalizing  
bad practices.  
# External Product Coaches  
There are many types of coaches out there, but when it comes to  
moving to the product model, there are four common types you  
should know about.  
# Delivery Coaches  
If your company is not yet able to do frequent, small, reliable, and  
uncoupled releases—no less frequently than once every two weeks—  
then you have some serious work to do.  
Delivery coaches are experienced engineering professionals who help  
product teams through the hard work of getting the test and release  
automation, instrumentation, monitoring and reporting, and  
deployment infrastructure to the level it needs to be.  
In certain cases, Agile coaches who have the actual work experience  
can help with this delivery coaching work. But Agile coaches who just  
focus on the delivery process \(e.g., Scrum, Kanban\) are not going to  
be especially helpful here.  
# Discovery Coaches  
The foundation of product coaching is discovery coaching. These  
people coach product teams on the techniques of product discovery.  
We see more discovery coaching opportunities out there than  
anything else, simply because so many product teams are asking for  
help. Moving from a feature team to an empowered product team  
primarily means learning how to discover a solution worth building,  
and this is what product discovery is all about.  
All successful discovery coaches we know are former product  
managers, product designers, or tech leads who have learned the skills and techniques of effective product discovery and love to share  
their knowledge with others.  
# Product Leadership Coaches  
As you read earlier when we discussed product model competencies  
and product model concepts, product leadership is hard. This is  
especially the case when trying to move to the product model. There  
are now big and critical topics like product vision, team topology,  
product strategy, team objectives, and, of course, developing their  
own staffing and coaching skills.  
Many people, especially in rapidly growing companies, have had  
“battlefield promotions,” and now find themselves leading product,  
design, or engineering, but they know they need help.  
All the successful product leadership coaches we know are former  
heads of product, heads of design, or heads of technology who have  
figured out how to tackle these big topics and who want to share  
what they've learned with others.  
# Transformation Coaches  
The final type of coaching we see are those who help guide the senior  
leadership team through the necessary changes in mindset and  
culture needed to move to the product model.  
Transformation coaches usually work directly with one of the senior  
leaders of the company.  
Senior leaders know they need to change product and engineering,  
but they know it will be even more difficult to change the way they  
fund \(finance\), the way they staff \(HR\), the way they sell and market  
\(sales and marketing\), and more.  
What makes this type of coaching especially tough is that the vast  
majority of CEOs simply won't trust the future of their company to a  
product coach who has not “been there and done that” as a senior  
leader with other large and complex companies.  
They need someone who can hold their own with the company's CFO  
and explain to the head of sales why changes are necessary yet can also engage directly with engineers, designers, and product  
managers.  
In every successful transformation we know, there was someone who  
knew what was necessary and had a trust-based relationship with the  
CEO.  
# Finding a Product Coach  
One way or another, it's essential that you have people who can  
coach those who are trying to learn the new way of working.  
Which leads to another of the most common sources of failed  
transformations\: hiring the wrong people to help.  
Most companies know they need help, but they don't know enough  
about the new way of working to judge the people they hire to help  
them.  
As obvious as this sounds, you need to make sure you have product  
coaches who actually can help your people learn the skills they need  
to learn. What is less obvious is that most of the people who try to  
sell you their services literally do not have this experience.  
To be explicit, if you are hiring a delivery coach, they need to have a  
track record of helping product teams get their test and release  
automation to the point where they can do continuous integration  
and continuous delivery.  
If you are hiring a discovery coach, they need to demonstrate to you  
that they have real experience with product discovery as either a  
product manager or product designer at a serious product company.  
If you are hiring a product leadership coach, they must demonstrate  
to you that they have leadership experience with product vision,  
product strategy, team topology, and team objectives at a serious  
product company.  
If you are hiring a transformation coach, they must demonstrate to  
you that they have the experience leading a company through a  
successful transformation to the product model.  
Why emphasize this? Because there exists a whole coaching industry  
that comes not from product companies, but instead from either specific software processes or management consultancies.  
But this is too important to leave at the theoretical level. So, we want  
to share with you the profiles of seven product coaches we know  
personally.  
It's important to emphasize that we have no financial relationships  
with any of these product coaches. But we often recommend them,  
and other product coaches like them, because we believe they have  
the knowledge and skills to help companies succeed.  
# Product Coach\: Gabrielle Bufrem  
Path to Product Gabrielle is truly a citizen of the world. She was born and raised in  
Brazil, then went to study in the United States. She speaks four  
languages fluently. She has lived and worked in ten different  
countries spanning Europe, North and South America, and Asia, and  
she has built products across nine major industries.  
Gabrielle fell in love with product during her internship at Google.  
The internship was in marketing, but she asked so many product-  
related questions that her manager said she sounded like a born  
product manager and that she really should explore that role.  
Gabrielle was immediately taken with the role and adjusted her final  
course load at Brown University to incorporate computer science and  
design.  
After her studies, she joined Education First in Boston and then  
Switzerland as their first product manager, then spent five years—  
first as a product manager, and then as a product leader—at Pivotal  
Labs, mostly in Silicon Valley, but also working in the Paris and  
Singapore offices.  
As she quickly moved up the product leadership ladder at Pivotal,  
Gabrielle focused increasingly on her coaching responsibilities to her  
team. She established a strong reputation as a product leader who  
knows how to develop strong product people and is willing to put in  
the time and effort to do so.  
After Pivotal, Gabrielle joined Little Otter Health, a mission-based  
startup in the mental health field, as their first head of product and  
design, then she proceeded to build a modern product team as well  
as significantly improving the product offering.  
# Journey to Coaching  
During her time at Pivotal, and then Little Otter, Gabrielle realized  
how much she enjoyed helping others, and she began teaching  
product management, speaking at industry conferences, and  
unofficially coaching people beyond her direct reports. She had  
incredible mentors and managers who shaped her view on product  
and on what was possible for her career.  
Gabrielle soon realized that what she loved most and did best in her  
previous roles was coaching and developing the  
people  
who led these product organizations. This realization inspired her to move into  
product coaching full time.  
While Gabrielle's specialty is coaching and developing product  
leaders  
, her superpower is quickly establishing a strong personal  
relationship and building trust. Trust is what allows Gabrielle to  
deliver the frank, honest, and critical feedback that helps people truly  
break past old limits to reach their full potential.  
Gabrielle is known both for her kindness and her toughness. She is  
able to be truly candid because the people she coaches know that she  
genuinely cares and is there explicitly to help them succeed.  
Much of this derives from her personality and life experiences.  
People can relate to her easily, and they see that she understands  
both product and people, and genuinely wants to help them meet  
their goals.  
Product Coach\: Hope Gurion Path to Product  
Hope began working in product in the early days of the internet,  
when she was in the middle of the mix helping to create many  
popular early consumer services, including online shopping, real  
estate, and job and career services.  
Hope's broad knowledge of business—especially business  
development, sales, marketing, advertising, and finance—combined  
with her passion for creating products and services that customers  
loved, put her on a proven path to product.  
Eventually, this led to building and leading the product organizations  
at major brands, including CareerBuilder and Beachbody, where she  
built a reputation for building strong product teams that were skilled at solving problems for customers in ways that met the needs of the  
business.  
In many of these companies, building the product organization  
meant moving beyond stakeholder-driven feature teams and  
transforming the broader organization to the product model.  
After doing this multiple times, Hope realized that she possessed  
unusual and valuable experience, which is especially important to  
product leaders who have the responsibility but have not yet  
experienced this way of working.  
At the same time, Hope witnessed so many companies that didn't  
know how to recruit or attract an experienced product leader skilled  
in the product model. These companies often ended up placing a  
high-potential leader from an adjacent function—such as  
engineering, design, marketing, or business strategy—into the  
product leadership role, but without any mechanism to set up the  
new leader for success.  
# Journey to Coaching  
In 2018, Hope made the decision to become a full-time product  
leadership coach. She also developed the  
Fearless Product  
Leadership  
podcast to help aspiring product leaders around the  
world learn what it takes to be a strong product leader.  
In addition to her work coaching product leaders, Hope coaches  
product teams in continuous product discovery through her work  
with Teresa Torres, author of  
Continuous Discovery Habits  
.  
One of the themes of Hope's career has been working at the  
intersection of business and product. Hope is especially interested in  
helping leaders and teams understand the dynamics of their business  
and precisely how their product work drives business results. Says  
Hope\:  
“During my time leading product teams, nothing thrilled me  
more than witnessing my teams reach their goals. Now, as a coach  
for product leaders, I'm thrilled when I witness their  
transformative shift in perspective. When they grasp the heart of a  
persistent challenge, it ignites newfound confidence and clarity,  
empowering them to fearlessly confront it head-on.” Product Coach\: Margaret Hollendoner  
# Path to Product  
Margaret discovered product management almost by accident after  
years of trying to blend her love of problem-solving and learning  
with her strengths in teams, people, and communication.  
Upon graduating from the mechanical engineering program at  
Stanford, she took a role as an applications engineer at a controls  
company in order to be customer facing. Margaret loved being on-  
site with customers, especially when teaching operators how to work  
machines and diagnose issues.  
Margaret initially thought she wanted to pursue a doctorate in  
thermodynamics, but when she realized how many hours of isolated research were involved, she left Stanford to seek out a more people-  
facing role.  
She decided to apply to Google, where her interviewer \(to whom she  
is forever grateful\) observed Margaret's mix of skills and motivations  
and guided her into product management.  
Over the next 18 years, Margaret learned product management from  
within Google. She soon learned the value of being “the person who  
crossed the street”—going between the engineering and customer-  
facing buildings to ensure product strategy and product discovery  
was close to the needs of users.  
It wasn't long before Margaret was managing teams of product  
managers delivering on entire product lines.  
During her nearly two decades at Google, she had the opportunity to  
work on all types of products, and with all manner of teams—from  
consumer to B2B, across health, video, commerce, and ads. She led  
organizations of 100+ designers, engineers, marketers, and more,  
and managed teams of product managers to discover, develop,  
iterate,  
launch, and land successful products such as AdSense,  
YouTube Video Measurement, and Google Fit.  
Margaret also worked on her fair share of discovery efforts that never  
saw the light of day, such as brick-and-mortar store offers, terrestrial  
TV measurement, medication management, and more. To build and  
lead motivated, fast-paced, and effective teams, she learned to  
celebrate success as well as failure and nurture both within the  
culture.  
# Journey to Coaching  
Margaret began her career at Google with a couple of years at the  
headquarters in Mountain View, but then she returned to her native  
England where she spent 15 years as a product and tech leader in  
Google's London offices.  
This position involved building and coaching innovative and diverse  
teams, often from scratch, that could successfully execute on  
technology-powered products. It was during this time that Margaret truly began to focus on her  
interest in coaching and developing others. She hired, developed,  
mentored, and advised across tech functions, including product,  
engineering, design, and research.  
Margaret built peer-mentoring communities across the women PMs,  
London PMs, and managers of PMs. She was a founding member of  
Google's tech apprenticeship program, bringing in recruits to be  
developed into software engineers. She developed and delivered  
training and brown-bag talks and supported individuals converting  
to product management from other roles.  
Margaret discovered that her passion for motivating and developing  
individuals to do incredible things matched her enthusiasm for  
building product vision and strategy herself. Developing product  
people was an amazing combination of both.  
Margaret was so engaged with the organizational development  
aspects that she took a temporary, six-month assignment into the  
tech HR team to help Google improve how cross-functional tech  
teams could collaborate and thrive.  
Outside of Google, she began mentoring and advising startups and  
individuals across the tech landscape, eventually giving her the  
motivation to become a full-time product coach.  
This allowed her to focus on the parts of the product leadership role  
she loved the most\: working with individuals and organizations to  
support them in crafting their product vision and strategy, align  
across stakeholders, and develop the most effective cross-functional  
product teams.  
As a product coach, Margaret is energized by the passion and  
dedication she encounters in individuals across all types of  
companies and industries, and she's inspired by their commitment to  
whatever their mission may be, whether it's solving women's health  
crises or selling parts to factories.  
It is these people who motivate her to continue coaching, and it's a  
unique opportunity to partner with leaders across industries to  
develop thriving, successful, cross-functional product teams that can  
have the greatest of impacts through technology. Product Coach\: Stacey Langer  
# Path to Product  
Stacey began her professional career by joining an electronics  
retailer, Best Buy, just as the company was starting to expand from  
physical retail to online.  
Stacey's career grew with the company as she took on progressively  
more responsibility and had the opportunity to learn firsthand many  
of the product roles as they were introduced to Best Buy. Over two decades at Best Buy, Stacey worked in content creation,  
product design, product management, and testing and optimization  
—initially as an individual contributor, then as a manager and  
director of product, and eventually as the company's senior vice  
president of product.  
Along the way, she witnessed the many challenges up close, and  
learned firsthand why an outsourced, waterfall technology model  
would not be able to meet the needs of customers or the business.  
Over time, Best Buy determined that it wasn't enough to have an e-  
commerce site. It needed to transform to the product model to better  
meet customer needs across channels.  
Stacey was one of the early managers asked to lead this effort. As  
such, she had to tackle the challenges of moving from outsourced IT  
to in-house product teams, and she had to staff and coach for all the  
key product competencies—including product management, product  
design, and engineering.  
The fact that Best Buy still exists and thrives, while so many other  
electronic retailers are no longer part of the competitive landscape, is  
testament to the company's ability to adapt and change and continue  
to provide real value to its customers.  
With her success guiding a major retailer through the challenges of  
transformation, Stacey decided to help do the same with the United  
States Digital Service, ultimately serving as the digital services  
director and deputy CTO of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to  
apply what she had learned to help millions of veterans better  
discover, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they earned.  
# Journey to Coaching  
One of the most fulfilling parts of Stacey's career has been creating  
space for talented teams to build great experiences for their users.  
She believes this is most possible within the product model, where a  
team of people with different capabilities, approaches, and  
perspectives all work together to create a solution that none of them  
would have come up with on their own. After working in product for many years, and leading  
transformations at very large enterprises, Stacey found herself being  
asked more and more to help leaders in other organizations who  
were taking on the challenge of transforming their teams.  
Stacey came to realize that the work of coaching leaders and teams  
was both impactful and something she loved to do. As a product  
coach, Stacey applies her real-world product leadership experience to  
help leaders and teams move to the product model, centered on their  
users, and bringing the best of themselves to create meaningful  
products.  
# Product Coach\: Dr. Marily Nika  
Path to Product Marily grew up in Greece, and she has a unique and inspiring story  
that demonstrates how passion for technology and perseverance led  
her to a successful Silicon Valley career.  
When Marily was seven years old, she discovered her brother's old  
BASIC programming book, and she spent countless hours learning  
on the family's Amstrad early personal computer. Coding became  
Marily's passion, and she knew from this young age that she wanted  
to study computer science.  
Unfortunately, Greece's unique academic system didn't allow  
students to directly choose their area of study, and Marily was  
instead enrolled to study economics. Almost everyone around her  
tried to convince Marily to let go of programming, but her parents  
and her first mentor told her that it matters less what you study in  
school and more where your passion is. Sure enough, Marily ended  
up getting a scholarship from Google, and eventually a doctorate in  
machine learning from the prestigious Imperial College in London.  
When Marily joined Google in 2013, she had no idea what product  
management was. But she was soon working with product managers  
and became mesmerized by the job.  
Thankfully, Google offered an internal product management rotation  
program, so she was able to see if the product role was a good fit for  
her. It wasn't easy to transition from her previous technical role to  
product, but Marily never looked back.  
Marily spent eight years at Google—both in London and in Silicon  
Valley—building AI products for Google Assistant and AR/VR, and  
then two years working at Meta's Reality Labs.  
# Journey to Coaching  
Given Marily's success with AI products, she naturally became a  
magnet for people asking for mentoring and career coaching—first  
from colleagues inside her companies, and soon beyond.  
Marily came to realize that not only was she good at mentoring and  
coaching, but she truly loved every minute of it. And her coaching  
naturally expanded to writing and teaching. Today, Marily is a popular product coach and speaker at major  
conferences, and she teaches AI product management through her  
own online courses and through Harvard Business School. More  
generally, Marily works tirelessly to help as many people as she can  
pursue their passions in AI technology and product.  
# Product Coach\: Phyl Terry  
# Path to Product  
Phyl has pursued a somewhat unconventional but extremely effective  
path to product. After being part of the first startup Amazon bought, and after a stint  
at McKinsey, Phyl joined Creative Good \(CG\) as CEO and proceeded  
to build and run it for 15 years.  
Creative Good built a reputation as a premier partner working with  
many of the top product teams and product companies in the world  
to help them get closer to their customers through hands-on user  
research, which the company termed “listening labs.”  
During this time, Phyl and the CG team engaged with many of the  
industry's leading companies, including American Express, Apple,  
BBC, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nike, and  
The New York Times  
as  
they all worked to gain a deeper understanding of their users and  
customers.  
To succeed at this work, Phyl engaged personally—not only with the  
product leaders and product teams, but also with the senior  
executive teams, who sometimes participated only reluctantly.  
All of these experiences gave Phyl an unparalleled opportunity to get  
to know strong product teams and product leaders from across the  
industry.  
# Journey to Coaching  
After the dot-com bubble burst, Phyl decided magic could happen  
when product leaders connect with one another. So, Phyl saw the  
opportunity to combine the two things they loved most\: coaching  
product leaders and connecting product leaders into a peer-network  
community.  
So, in 2003, Phyl founded Collaborative Gain and has been building  
this community for the past 20 years. It is the largest such network  
in the world, with several hundred product leaders from product  
companies around the world.  
Phyl has helped countless product leaders not only to become more  
effective at their jobs, but also to find more satisfaction and  
happiness in their careers and lives.  
They have learned that good coaching goes well beyond good  
listening. It obviously requires knowledge of the substance. It  
requires a continuous-learning mindset. It requires a real willingness to roll up your sleeves and do the work—both the coach and the  
coachee. It requires a deep understanding of company politics and  
culture. It requires a willingness to have difficult and even  
uncomfortable interactions. But most of all, it requires real  
thinking  
—thinking hard as you formulate your coaching advice and coaching  
the coachee in how to think through hard problems.  
Phyl also loves to coach through writing, and they have published  
Customers Included  
and  
Never Search Alone\: The Job Seeker's  
Playbook  
. For the latter, Phyl has built a free, volunteer-driven  
global community of thousands of product managers \(and others\)  
looking to grow their careers and find great roles.  
# Product Coach\: Petra Wille  
Path to Product Petra's journey to product began more than two decades ago. She  
began her career working in engineering for several years, but from  
early on, she was fascinated by the creative process of building  
products.  
Driven by a desire to understand the big picture and to make a  
greater impact, she transitioned from engineering to product  
management. As a product manager, she was able to get involved  
with every aspect of product creation—from concept to launch.  
Petra worked for several high-profile German companies, and these  
years of hands-on experience helped her learn the ropes of product  
management and product teams, and understand the intricacies and  
nuances of creating great products.  
Soon, Petra was promoted into leadership positions, and she served  
as a product leader for two major German tech-powered companies\:  
XING and tolingo. In her new role, she had her first real  
responsibility for coaching, and she immediately understood the  
importance of people development in her work. In addition to the joy  
she found in helping others, she discovered that her focus on  
coaching had the additional benefit of attracting and retaining talent.  
# Journey to Coaching  
Petra's transition into full-time coaching felt like a natural next step.  
When Petra left her head of product role to go out on her own, she  
had the freedom to lean into her coaching skills. She began  
conducting workshops and coaching sessions, gradually developing a  
toolkit of her own personal coaching strategies that she has  
continued to build and develop.  
As a product coach, Petra has empowered many product managers  
and product leaders to find their own pathways to success. She's  
witnessed people going from feeling lost amid organizational  
changes, to confidently steering their teams toward success.  
As with all good product coaches, her approach doesn't involve  
forcing a one-size-fits-all strategy or framework onto the people and  
organizations she works with. Instead, she tailors her coaching to the  
individual needs and context of the people and companies she is  
trying to help. Petra's coaching journey has led her across a broad spectrum of  
industries, from healthcare technology to e-commerce to container  
shipping. But the common thread is helping people create successful  
products and fulfilling careers. As Petra explains\:  
“A strong product  
coach meets people exactly where they stand, regardless of how  
early or advanced they are in their product journey. This ability  
comes from a foundation rooted in real-world experiences in  
product, providing a bedrock of understanding from which they  
can offer relevant and actionable coaching and advice. It's this  
hands-on experience, coupled with a genuine passion for helping  
others, that allows a coach to bring about transformative change.”  
In 2020, Petra published  
STRONG Product People\: A Complete  
Guide to Developing Great Product Managers,  
and she is also an  
active leader of the European product community—both speaking at  
and organizing popular product conferences. CHAPTER 35  
# Innovation Story\: Datasite  
Marty's Note\: Another very common misconception in the product  
community is that innovation only happens in consumer products,  
but that it's a different game when building products for large  
companies. It is unfortunately true that many enterprise software  
companies have been slow to move to the product model, and it's  
also true that sales-driven organizations can be difficult to change.  
But as this example shows, for the ones that do, the rewards are  
substantial  
.  
# Company Background  
You learned in  
part VII  
about the Datasite transformation story. But  
the reason companies invest in moving to the product model is so the  
organization is capable of consistent innovation. This innovation  
story shares one such example.  
One of the keys to a successful mergers and acquisitions \(M&A\)  
business is privacy. During the M&A process, numerous confidential  
documents are exchanged between the involved parties. If these  
documents are not handled securely, they can be lost, misplaced, or  
stolen.  
Document redaction  
is the process of selectively removing or  
obscuring confidential data from a document to protect sensitive  
information from unauthorized access or disclosure while still  
allowing the remaining content to be shared or published.  
Redaction typically is applied to text, images, or other media within a  
document. The process involves ensuring that this content cannot be  
revealed to the public or, in some cases, sold on the dark web.  
Document redaction can be performed manually, where either  
lawyers or paralegals carefully review the document and apply  
redaction marks or cover sensitive information using physical or digital methods. Manual redaction requires attention to detail to  
ensure the selected information is hidden effectively.  
In 2019, redacted documents played a prominent role in a major  
legal and political news story.  
One of the lawyers inadvertently filed a poorly redacted document to  
the court, and the public was able to view previously hidden  
information.  
Due to the ensuing headlines, the case proved to be a wake-up call to  
the business community, which realized that the tools they were  
using for data redaction were not as effective as they had once  
believed.  
# The Problem to Solve  
Datasite knew that to maintain client confidence, it had to build a  
redaction tool that could ensure the integrity of the documents  
shared during the M&A process.  
The fundamental problem was that while most redaction tools were  
able to remove or mask a text item or image, they did not destroy  
the  
metadata behind it, and a determined person could forensically  
recreate the redacted data.  
Datasite decided there was no adequate solution on the market, so  
they needed to build a new and truly effective redaction product  
themselves.  
Before the company's transformation, this wasn't something the  
organization would have been in a position to pursue. But Datasite  
had been building the skills for this since moving to the product  
model.  
As the product team spent time with customers to understand their  
redaction needs, the team began to evaluate the various technical  
approaches that might be used to do this deep redaction.  
They quickly recognized that it had to be able to pinpoint select data  
from hundreds, sometimes thousands, of documents, then remove  
not only the data but also its metadata in such a way that it did not  
harm the rest of the document. Discovering the Solution  
The engineers needed a way to cleanse a document yet recreate the  
redacted data with the right permissions and access to the Datasite  
system.  
As is so often the case, one of the engineers figured out a novel  
approach to this problem, inspired by an approach used in Google  
Maps. To prove technical feasibility, the engineers built a feasibility  
prototype, and demonstrated it to the product team and product  
leaders.  
Next, the engineers needed to prototype and test the customer  
experience on the Datasite platform.  
The team worked with 12 customer discovery partners in Europe and  
North America to discover and test this proposed solution. This  
extensive validation testing enabled sales, marketing, and service  
teams to participate early in discovery with clients in London, Paris,  
and New York.  
# The Results  
The end result was the discovery of a now-patented technology that  
automatically redacts a document, or an entire virtual data room of  
documents, by removing both data and metadata without any  
possibility of identifying what had been removed. Equally important,  
documents can also be automatically unredacted when necessary.  
Datasite's redaction tool became a significant market differentiator  
that provided real value and peace of mind to the company's clients. PART IX  
# Transformation Story\: Adobe  
By Lea Hickman  
Marty's Note\: What follows is one of the most impressive  
transformations I've ever seen. Adobe was always a solid company  
and it created several successful products, but it wasn't operating in  
the product model, and it knew it needed to change in order to  
survive the challenges headed its way. In this case, the company's  
innovation story is what drove its transformation story. The driver  
for the transformation was the need to create the new Creative  
Cloud offering. The story is told by Lea Hickman, who was  
appointed head of product management for the new Adobe Creative  
Cloud. Lea teamed up with CTO Kevin Lynch, among others, and  
with the help and support of some very strong senior executives,  
they were able to pull off what is considered the industry's most  
financially successful transformation to date  
.  
Many people think of Adobe as a post–internet era company but, in  
fact, the company was founded in 1982 and has played a key role  
through many generations of technology, starting with printers and  
personal computers. Today, the company spans many different  
businesses, mainly focused on providing designers with the tools and  
technology they need to build our digital world.  
# The Motivation  
In some companies, there are early indicators that point to the need  
to change the way the company produces its products.  
Sometimes, it is a new disruptive technology, or a major shift in  
market dynamics. Much of the time, the organizations are able to  
adjust and react accordingly.  
Back when I worked at Adobe, from 2007 to 2014, we were going  
through just such a time. We were facing major shifts in technology,  
market, and competitive landscapes. At the time, I had product management responsibility for the design,  
web, and interactive tools in the digital media organization. This  
portfolio included tools like Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator,  
Adobe Dreamweaver, and Adobe Flash Authoring, among others. We  
sold our products as individual tools as well as bundles that we called  
the Creative Suites.  
Each Creative Suite had many different bundles based on customer  
personas. For example, there was a Design Suite, a Web Suite, and  
others. There was also a suite called the Master Collection, which  
included one of every tool we sold.  
Our primary business model at the time was to sell upgrades of these  
tools and suites to existing customers, and to sell full versions to new  
customers.  
Each time we would plan for a new release, we would project how  
many upgrades and full versions of the product we would need to sell  
to hit our revenue targets. We would project this based on our  
confidence on whether the upcoming release would achieve product-  
market fit.  
In the midst of our analysis for an upcoming release, the data  
indicated that what our customers already had might be good  
enough for them, meaning that the likelihood of them upgrading was  
not high.  
At the time, all the products were quite mature, having been in the  
market for well over a decade. With the prices continuing to rise, the  
question was whether we were building enough value into the release  
to compel customers to upgrade or buy.  
Another challenge we had was our long product cycles. When I first  
joined Adobe, our product cycles were roughly 18 to 24 months  
between major releases. That changed somewhat over time as we  
started delivering point releases in between the major releases.  
Doing this helped us to introduce new features that leveraged new  
technologies in an interim cycle. While this helped from a revenue  
recognition perspective, it didn't help with addressing new  
competition as competitors had already adopted the practice of  
continuous releases. As more software was being delivered as a service during this time  
frame, new competitors entered the market. Competitors such as  
Sketch and Aviary were being mentioned by customers increasingly  
often. While these competitors were very new to the market, their  
value proposition of a simple, modern design tool resonated with  
customers who were using only a fraction of the capabilities of our  
old, complex tools.  
Also around the time, new technologies were having a significant  
impact on how customers worked. In particular, the iPhone had been  
out for a few years, and more people were talking about cloud-based  
services.  
The idea that the cloud was going to be where users \(designers\)  
stored their data, versus their desktop or laptop, was very powerful  
because it would unshackle users from specific devices and allow  
them to access their data and files from any device, anywhere.  
This of course would lead to a change in the way designers ideated  
and designed, and their workflows would change dramatically as a  
result. It would mean, for example, that more ideas would be  
captured by the cameras on smartphones, and this would open yet  
more possibilities.  
Our solution for mobile app authoring at the time was very  
proprietary. We evangelized using Flash authoring and Flex as a way  
of building rich applications that would run on both Android and  
iOS,  
assuming another one of our products, Adobe Air, would serve  
as a container for those applications. At the time, the idea of writing  
applications once and being able to run them across multiple mobile  
operating systems was very compelling.  
Although a segment of our customer base supported that, a large  
portion believed that a native app would perform better, and others  
felt a standards-based framework would be a better approach.  
Those changing workflows meant we needed to rethink not only how  
our customers built applications, but we also needed to think about  
how  
we  
built mobile applications.  
This philosophical disconnect created a lot of churn within the  
company. How could we build native applications ourselves when we recommended that our customers build using our proprietary  
frameworks?  
Another dramatic shift during this time was a change in who our  
customers were. There was a shift underway from print to digital  
mediums, and there was a shift from professionals to more part-time  
hobbyists or aficionados.  
While a portion of our sales always consisted of those markets, the  
trend was becoming clear\: New competitors that had simpler tools  
were more compelling to nonprofessional users.  
There was also a change underway in buyer behavior. At one time,  
Creative Suite buyers would go into their local tech store and  
purchase the Creative Suite right off the shelf. They would then  
install DVDs of the software on their laptop or desktop.  
Many years earlier, we introduced the ability for users to download  
the software, and now downloads were becoming the preferred  
method. With download speeds increasing, it became much easier  
for people to purchase and download right from their home and  
office—disintermediating the retailer or reseller, or at least reducing  
the number of units sold through that channel.  
The final area of motivation was in the form of an open letter that  
Steve Jobs personally published on April 29, 2010, about Flash and  
why Apple made the decision that the technology would not be  
allowed on Apple's iOS devices.  
This was a substantial blow. Our Creative Professional products had  
always supported Apple's hardware because Creative Professional  
customers loved Apple products.  
We knew we had to take a different approach.  
But knowing changes are needed is not the same as being willing and  
able to change.  
So far all we had was the stick.  
We knew that if we didn't make major changes both to how we  
worked and to our product offerings, we would lose our market  
position.  
We knew that we also needed a carrot. If we were to make the necessary changes, what would we be able to  
do for our customers and for our business that we could not do  
today?  
Adobe had a long history and culture around an existing and thus far  
successful way of working. And while the forces going forward were  
clearly troubling, it's important to recognize that, at the time, Adobe  
was the clear leader in the industry—a publicly traded company—  
with the Creative Suite representing more than \$2 billion in annual  
revenue for the company.  
To answer this question, three of the senior leaders at Adobe—our  
then CTO, Kevin Lynch, the SVP of our Platform Business, David  
Wadhwani, and the SVP of our Creative Business, Johnny Loiacono  
—called an offsite. They asked each product category to come to the  
offsite prepared to present and demo new product ideas that were  
beyond their desktop tool offerings. Specifically, they were looking  
for mobile apps and hosted services.  
While we knew that hosted services and mobile apps were critical to  
future value for our customers, we didn't know how far the teams  
had progressed in their thinking. At the offsite, it became apparent  
that each area of the organization had a different vision for what it  
thought customers wanted, and the visions were not aligned.  
At that offsite, senior leaders realized that not only did we need a  
unifying vision beyond just the capabilities that the cloud, mobile,  
and desktop could bring customers, but we needed a product leader  
to drive that vision. The leaders asked me to take on that role, along  
with strong engineering leaders, especially Kevin Stewart.  
The vision had to make it very clear not only to our product teams,  
but to our executives, stakeholders, investors, analysts, and  
customers.  
We began with our CEO, Shantanu Narayen, and our CFO, Mark  
Garrett.  
We realized that we would be asking these two key leaders to make a  
very significant bet—potentially a bet-the-company bet—and we  
knew that if they were not convinced, there was simply no way the  
rest of the company would go along with such disruptive changes. So back to the question of what's the carrot? Why go through all this?  
The main tool for answering this question was the product vision,  
and this vision proved to be the key to getting the senior leaders and  
the many stakeholders on board. We'll discuss the key role of the  
product vision in more detail below, but the result was that both the  
CEO and the CFO could understand the motivation and the benefits,  
and they were able to begin to work through how they could help.  
# Transforming to the Product Model  
While the company faced many challenges, it's also important to  
recognize that it had several important assets.  
Adobe already had a strong engineering and product design culture.  
It had a strong reputation for technical talent and a track record of  
providing several of the core components of the technology industry.  
And perhaps most important, the company had a large and  
passionate customer base.  
That said, the product leadership team and I knew we had to drive  
significant changes across the company.  
# Changing How We Build  
As our customers' needs were changing in terms of how they wanted  
to ideate, design, and collaborate, the technologies we used and  
supported had to change as well, including how we built and  
deployed our products.  
Our waterfall-driven product cycles were simply far too long. It was  
no longer tenable for our customers to wait 12 to 18 months to be  
able to take advantage of new capabilities. The market and  
competition would leave us behind.  
The speed of innovation in web standards and mobile devices pushed  
us toward a continuous development and delivery model.  
While Adobe had and still has very strong engineers, early on there  
was real resistance to moving to the model of continuous  
deployment. There is a very obvious trade-off between improving the lives of  
customers versus improving the lives of the engineers building and  
supporting products. Historically, if customers discovered a critical  
problem, they could always just install the previous version. But in a  
cloud-based solution, if a problem exists, it potentially impacts all  
customers. There is no easy way for a customer to go to any version  
other than the one that is live and supported by Adobe. For this  
reason, the engineers have to constantly keep the service running  
and working properly.  
In addition to committing to this level of service, being able to deploy  
continuously and independently involves significant architectural  
changes in how the products are designed, built, tested, and  
deployed.  
To the credit of Adobe's engineers, they stepped up to this challenge  
and delivered for the company and for their customers. It's just  
important that readers understand that this was not easy and not  
without early resistance.  
# Changing How We Solve Problems  
In addition to changing how we built and deployed our products, we  
also needed to change how we solved problems.  
At the time, Adobe had a very engineering- and designer-driven  
culture.  
Engineers or designers typically would come up with product ideas  
and pitch them to product managers. These product managers would  
create requirements around the ideas, identifying the problems they  
solved and the value proposition to the designer customer.  
Many of these strong engineers and designers were promoted over  
time, and engineering leadership was highly valued—in many cases  
much more so than product management or product marketing.  
The good news was that there was already a strong culture of  
empowered engineers, but the bad news was that there were many  
layers of people and organization between the engineers and the  
actual designer customers purchasing our products. Too often this would result in capabilities that didn't achieve the  
level of adoption we had hoped for.  
We knew that if we wanted the level of continuous innovation that  
the future would depend on, we needed to empower not just the  
engineers but true, cross-functional product teams, and then enable  
them to engage directly with the customers.  
So we invested in cross-functional product teams of product  
managers, product designers, and engineers, working closely with  
product marketing to engage directly with users to understand their  
new challenges and to discover solutions that addressed these needs  
effectively.  
While the company had strong engineers and product designers, this  
change depended on a strong product management role.  
To be very clear, there were already many strong product managers  
in the organization, but historically their role was more focused on  
building business cases, capturing requirements, and working with  
product marketing to prepare for the upcoming release. They also  
had a significant project management responsibility to report  
progress on the milestones. But we needed the role to change to be  
primarily about product discovery and the necessary focus on value  
and viability.  
And just as product development needed to move from a project-  
based waterfall style of work to continuous development and  
delivery, the product discovery work had to change.  
Because the competitive landscape and customer expectations were  
changing so quickly, we couldn't assume that what was true six  
months ago was still true today.  
# Changing How We Decide Which Problems to  
# Solve  
# A Compelling Product Vision  
With engineering, design, product marketing, product management,  
and others, we started talking about customers and the challenges they had.  
We knew many of our customers had an issue with affordability,  
especially those smaller design shops that couldn't afford to upgrade  
to the latest version of the tools.  
We also knew that most of our customers were very excited about  
using mobile phones and tablets to ideate and create. In addition, we  
knew there were many different venues and sites for designers to  
publish their designs to potentially attract new clients.  
Given our market position, didn't Adobe have permission to solve  
these problems?  
Our product vision started taking shape once we realized that instead  
of focusing internally about what we wanted to accomplish for our  
business, we should instead start talking about designer customers  
and how we could improve their lives.  
We decided to write an aspirational “day in the life” narrative about a  
freelance graphic designer we named Marissa.  
Marissa had her own design shop in which she employed a few other  
designers.  
One day, the creative director of Nike was browsing  
creative.adobe.com  
and came across an interesting piece of artwork  
that caught his eye. The story goes on to explore elements of the  
website and allows the Nike creative director to reach out to Marissa  
to ask her for a proposal for a new advertising campaign he wants to  
kick off.  
Marissa leverages the Adobe tablet applications, cloud syncing, and  
desktop tools to create a compelling proposal and is also able to  
source other photographers and designers to help her with the  
project once she won the bid.  
The narrative and the  
visiontype  
that showcased it became guiding  
forces behind what we wanted to do for our designer customers.  
The belief was that if we did the right thing for our designer  
customers, then they would stay with us and new customers would  
join us. We knew we had effective mechanisms to capture the value. This assumption had to be tested both externally with customers and  
internally with stakeholders.  
We started sharing the vision with key designer customers to explain  
our view of the future and why we thought it would be beneficial.  
Equally and critically important, we started sharing the product  
vision with key stakeholders. We had a hypothesis that our go-to-  
market model would have to change, as would how we packaged our  
offering. We knew that these changes would have significant  
implications for sales, marketing, and finance.  
The visiontype was key in helping us understand not only what the  
future held for our designer customers, but the current gaps we had  
in our portfolio, to decide which problems were critical to solve and  
the priority order to address those problems.  
# An Insight-Driven Product Strategy  
Our product strategy work identified two major problem areas for  
our customers.  
The first problem area was around identity management and the  
second was cloud-based syncing of data.  
Identity was something we knew we needed to address immediately.  
What might be acceptable on a desktop solution would not be  
acceptable in a cloud-based solution accessed from a variety of  
devices.  
Multiple identity systems are not only cumbersome for users; they  
also hindered our ability to collect the usage data that would be so  
important for both personalization and license management.  
We knew we needed to have a common identity system—especially if  
we were going to have a user access all their content, services, and  
tools from anywhere.  
The second problem area was syncing of files and other data from  
mobile devices, tablets, cloud applications, and desktop with no loss  
of data or fidelity.  
Product Planning Remember that the Creative Suite was not just a single solution but  
rather an integrated suite of more than 20 different products.  
Moving to a new generation would involve not just moving the  
component products but also addressing gaps.  
We pursued a strategy of migrating some applications, redesigning  
and rebuilding other applications, and strategically acquiring select  
components where the technology or the team could help us more  
quickly achieve our product vision.  
The product vision helped in communicating the shared goals of the  
work and in determining which problems were most important to  
solve.  
Each of the many product teams brought strong opinions on how  
they wanted to improve their products, and this enthusiasm was  
good. But we needed the teams to internalize and prioritize  
Marissa's needs  
and ultimately become obsessed with them.  
The vision also required the teams to truly collaborate. Whether it  
was integrating a common identity system so a customer needed only  
one Adobe ID, or if it meant that files needed to traverse multiple  
platforms, a significant amount of coordination and collaboration  
was required.  
Fortunately, we already had this muscle memory because every  
product cycle we released not only individual point products but  
Suites that were focused on key customer segments. The product  
teams referred to this as the  
Suite Tax  
.  
Also, some broad decisions needed to be made from both a  
technology perspective and a design perspective. Design was a bit  
easier because we had strong design leadership, and we had a  
precedent in terms of the belief that customers and users should  
experience a consistent experience regardless of what device or tool  
they were using.  
The same philosophy held true when it came to cloud-based services  
and mobile applications. There would be a strong point of view in  
certain functionality and iconography. A design system would be put  
in place with fully coded components for where we needed  
consistency, and then the individual product teams could experiment  
in areas that weren't required to be consistent. Changing How We Go to Market  
The final aspect of being able to get the Creative Cloud launched was  
real collaboration with key stakeholders. In particular, we were not  
only changing our products, but also changing our business model  
and the product's go-to-market strategy.  
Recall that in the past, we typically released and launched a new  
version of our products every 12 to 18 months. We would have a very  
long development cycle and a very complex, coordinated go-to-  
market strategy. We would take months of planning which features  
would be highlighted, and we would craft messaging and positioning  
documents, create demos to bring on press tours, and spend  
substantial time and money on collateral and packaging.  
With an SaaS-based subscription model, we would be improving the  
products and releasing continuously, so we wouldn't have the time to  
do this.  
We would have to change how we informed customers about new  
features and change our other communication channels. We would  
need to worry about discoverability of new features because we  
wouldn't have the marketing machine of the launch to drive  
awareness of them.  
Another challenge was that we communicated with our customers  
primarily through press and analyst channels. We would go on press  
tours, where product managers and product marketing managers  
would showcase and demo the latest releases to key industry pundits  
to garner favorable reviews. This approach helped customers and  
users determine why and if they should buy the latest version of the  
product.  
By taking our products directly to the designer customers, we had to  
ensure that customers could quickly discover and learn new  
capabilities without the yearly event of installing a new release.  
As you can see, this impacts how the sales organization sells to  
enterprise customers, how the channel organization works with retail  
partners, how product marketing needs to adapt, and more.  
To prepare for all these changes, the product team had to collaborate  
very closely with the go-to-market teams to manage the transition. Virtually every part of Adobe was impacted by the transformation,  
and especially by the changes to the product offering.  
If nothing else, I hope I have communicated the scope of the  
necessary changes. Nothing about this level of change is easy.  
# The Results  
We measured the success of the transformation by the number of  
customers, the revenue, and the shareholder value.  
With the Creative Suite, there were 6 million customers. With the  
Creative Cloud, by the end of 2021, there were 26 million  
subscribers.  
With the Creative Suite, revenue hit \$2 billion a year. With the  
Creative Cloud, we recorded \$11.5 billion in 2021.  
During this time, Adobe's market cap grew from \$13 billion to \$269  
billion.  
The business outcomes were clear, and this transformation is  
considered one of the most financially successful in industry history. PART X  
# Overcoming Objections  
With any sizable group of people, there will always be objections to  
any significant change.  
It's true that there are always some people who resist change just  
because they don't like change, and we have techniques for dealing  
with that.  
But the more difficult case is that people often have very legitimate  
concerns, and they simply don't see how those concerns would be  
addressed in this new model.  
The chapters in this part enumerate the major concerns coming from  
all across the organization—and also the concerns that come from  
inside the product organization itself—and then discuss how we  
address each one. CHAPTER 36  
# Objections from Customers  
Note\: Much of this discussion is informed by  
chapter 21  
,  
“Partnering with Customers.”  
“Our users believe that it's absolutely essential for you to  
provide this specific capability. Unless you can commit to  
that, we can't commit to buying your product.” This is a very common and often reasonable objection from  
customers.  
It's especially important to keep in mind that many of these  
customers have heard years of promises from companies, and  
their sales and marketing staff, yet have seen very few deliver on  
those promises. It is understandable that people would be  
skeptical after that.  
First, it's important to make sure the customer understands the  
difference between a commercial product company and a custom  
solutions provider.  
Second, realize that it's very normal for customers to express their  
desire in the form of a solution, and it's the job of product to  
determine the problem behind the solution they are requesting.  
If the customer's situation is truly unique, and represents a  
market of one, then it's usually most appropriate to direct that  
company to a custom solutions provider that has a business model  
designed around this case.  
However, if you believe the customer is part of your current or  
upcoming target market, and you believe this capability is in line  
with your product strategy, then this is a good opportunity to  
engage directly with this customer to gain a deeper understanding  
of what it will take to succeed.  
You need to be clear with the customer that you are committed to  
solving this problem for them, but that you need to solve it in a  
way that also works for other customers in this market.  
Sometimes there is a clear solution that will work for this  
customer and others, but in other cases, some significant product  
discovery work will be required to come up with a solution that  
the customer loves, is technically feasible, and is also viable for  
their business.  
It may be helpful to explain to customers that most of their  
favorite products were ones that customers did not even realize  
were possible at the time.  
“I need to know when I can count on this feature being  
delivered.” Per the previous discussion, you need to determine if this  
feature is part of your product strategy or not. But assuming it  
is, when a specific date is explicitly required, before you make  
any promises you might not be able to keep, you need to realize  
this is what  
high-integrity commitments  
are for.  
“We are making a major bet on your company if we  
purchase this product, and we need to make sure the  
direction you are  
going is where we want to go as well.  
We need to see your product roadmap to know if that's the  
case.”  
Especially in the enterprise software world, companies often are  
making a very substantial investment and bet on your company.  
They need to know not just what you do today, but where you  
are going tomorrow.  
Most people will ask for a product roadmap, so you may need to  
explain the inherent risks of product roadmaps. It can also be  
helpful to maintain both internal product roadmaps and  
external, customer-sharable product roadmaps.  
That said, it is actually the  
product vision  
that directly addresses  
this very real customer need. And it's helpful to the product  
organization to validate this product vision with feedback from  
customers. So, when we have the choice, we prefer to share the  
product vision rather than product roadmaps.  
“It is so much work to deal with your new releases, I can  
only handle them every 3/6/12 months.”  
“We need thorough documentation and training for every  
new release.” These are very legitimate objections, but the root cause of these  
objections is actually due to releasing too  
infrequently  
. You are  
delivering too much change at once to the users, and you are  
causing too much disruption to your customers.  
When updating to a new release is a major pain, it's no surprise  
people would want to go through this less frequently and not  
more frequently.  
Sometimes, customers believe that getting a release less  
frequently means they will get a higher-quality release. But the  
evidence is overwhelmingly the opposite, and you may need to  
explain to customers why this is the case.  
In  
chapter 4  
, “Changing How You Build,” we discussed  
continuous delivery techniques to prevent this problem. In the  
product model, the customer receives a continuous stream of  
small, reliable, incremental changes. Those changes are  
designed such that users are not impacted—or to the degree they  
are, they do not need retraining.  
It's also useful to understand that there is a difference between  
when you release something, and when that new capability is  
visible to the customer. One continuous delivery technique is to  
“release dark,” which releases the new capability into  
production, but you control if and when this new capability is  
visible to customers. This is known as  
feature flagging. Feature  
gating  
can allow us to control the subset of users that we want  
exposed to this new capability.  
Sometimes, it is helpful to point out to customers that this is  
already how many of their favorite mission-critical products  
work, whether it is their browser, their phone, their new car, or  
even their new washing machine.  
If they still believe they need to recertify every week, they can do  
that, but eventually they will come to trust that you are ensuring  
they are always running the most stable and effective solution.  
Today's customers demand better than the prior era's quarterly  
or yearly big-bang releases. “We are very uncomfortable with the idea that you are  
collecting data on our use of your products. Why should  
we allow this?”  
There are two important things to emphasize here. First, when  
your products report back usage data to the product team, the  
data has been anonymized and aggregated so that there is no  
personally identifiable information. Second, this data is used to  
make sure the product is working properly for customers and  
truly helping customers to solve their problem. This is important  
both for your customers and for you.  
Just as a pilot flying a plane depends on instrumentation to  
show that she is on the right course and that the plane is flying  
safely, product teams depend on this instrumentation for the  
same reasons.  
“We were working as part of a customer discovery  
program, and we were very excited about the progress,  
but then we were told that you decided not to pursue this  
new product. Is this normal? Did we do something  
wrong?”  
This is not common, but it does occasionally happen, and we  
hope this possibility was explained to you at the outset. The  
main reason for this is that the product team was not able to find  
a single solution that would work across the range of customers  
they were collaborating with. Sometimes, the needs of a  
customer truly are unique, and turn out to be better suited to a  
custom development firm rather than a commercial product  
company. CHAPTER 37  
# Objections from Sales  
Note\: Much of this discussion is informed by  
chapter 21  
,  
“Partnering with Customers.”  
“We are the ones sitting down with customers every day.  
Why shouldn't we be the ones to tell the product team  
what needs to be delivered?”  
There is no question that salespeople operate on the front lines  
with customers, and as such they are valuable sources of input for  
the products. In the product model, product managers have  
strong relationships with salespeople from across the company  
because they truly depend on one another. Product managers are  
also encouraged to actively participate in the sales process for key  
prospects.  
More generally, product managers and product teams have direct,  
ongoing engagement with users and customers. Not in a sales  
context, but in a product discovery context.  
That said, there is a foundational principle which explains why  
strong product solutions rarely come from the customer or from  
the salesperson\:  
The customer and the salesperson do not know what is technically  
possible.  
They are often experts in their own domain, but rarely are they  
experts in the enabling technologies used to build the solutions  
they buy.  
When they buy your products, they are effectively hiring you to be  
the experts for them. Strong products come from combining real  
customer needs with solutions that are just now possible.  
“This is a great product vision, but it's years in the  
making. I need to make my numbers now. How will what's being built help my sales team make their numbers  
this quarter or next?”  
While it is important to share the product vision, it's also critical  
that you provide the sales force with products they can sell  
now  
.  
The best way to do that is to provide them with referenceable  
customers that are using the latest offering and loving it.  
More generally, you may need to explain to the sales leader how  
each of the product efforts is intended to result in direct business  
impact.  
“I have a very promising prospect, but we need to commit  
to some new capabilities to close the deal.” In the product model, one of the greatest fears of product teams is  
what are known as  
specials  
. These are one-off capabilities that  
are done for specific customers to satisfy specific requests. It does  
not take many of these specials before a product is more complex,  
less nimble, and harder to learn and use for everyone.  
The first thing we recommend for handling these specials when  
moving to the product model is to have any special request \(for  
anything other than currently shipping products\) first go through  
the head of sales. That person can, it is hoped, prevent most of the  
requests from proceeding.  
For the requests that do get past the head of sales, the product  
manager has a responsibility first to understand if the prospect is  
in the target market, and then to understand what problem the  
prospect is trying to solve by requesting this capability.  
In many cases, the prospect is in the target market. Once the  
product manager understands the problem behind the request,  
she can identify a solution that would meet the needs not only of  
this prospect, but of other current and future customers as well.  
In other cases, the customer is outside the target market, or the  
solution needed is not within the scope of the product strategy, so  
the right answer to is decline this opportunity in the name of  
being able to pursue the larger opportunity.  
More generally, this type of special request is very often the result  
of not yet having referenceable customers, which then forces  
salespeople into these sorts of conversations with prospects.  
“We lost a big deal specifically because we are missing  
some key capabilities as compared to our competitors.  
Why would that not be our top priority?” Every experienced product team knows that customers often say  
one thing and do another—sometimes consciously but often not.  
If a prospective customer chooses a competitor, they will often  
point to something easy as an excuse, which can lead product  
teams on a never-ending feature chasing journey.  
And sometimes you really are lacking a critical feature. Again, a  
focus on developing reference customers is generally the best way  
to know the difference.  
“We keep losing in deals against this key competitor.  
What can we do to better compete?”  
In this case, the sales organization is explicitly asking product  
\(and product marketing\) for help coming up with an effective  
response. It's very possible that major product work is underway  
at the moment to address this, but it's also possible that this work  
may take awhile, as some major changes may be required.  
This is where product managers and product marketing can put  
their heads together to try to point out opportunities to give the  
sales team something helpful to say or sell. Are there segments  
where the current offering is superior to this new competitor? Can  
we quickly develop some new reference customers for that  
segment?  
“I work very hard to manage my prospects and  
customers, and I don't want people from product teams  
risking that.” First, it's important to acknowledge that direct, unencumbered  
access to users and customers is absolutely essential to creating  
successful products. It is one of the few truly nonnegotiables in  
the product model. If necessary, the CEO may need to be called  
upon to make this point to sales leadership directly.  
That said, it is also true that there have been cases of members of  
product teams saying or doing something inappropriate or unwise  
while interacting with a customer or prospect. It is the  
responsibility of the product leaders to ensure their people have  
been coached on appropriate behavior.  
For companies with a strong account control ethos \(which is not  
at all a bad thing\), you can ask the sales organization to arrange a  
short “customer interaction training” for anyone going out to visit  
customers. This is sometimes referred to as  
charm school  
.  
In addition to learning the roles and responsibilities of the  
different members of the sales and services organizations—and  
the expected behavioral norms—it's important to impress upon  
anyone about to  
visit a customer and likely to meet users, some of  
whom may be very unhappy, that any promises they make they  
will absolutely need to keep.  
While this is not an alternative to product teams spending time  
with customers, it's also worth pointing out that today there are  
several excellent tools for product teams to get a better  
understanding of the conversations going on during sales calls,  
and there is always a great deal to learn both about the product  
and the product's go-to-market.  
“I want to make sure that we don't have random product  
teams contacting my customers every week without  
coordinating with each other, and especially without  
coordinating with me.”  
This is entirely reasonable, and your product ops/user research  
team is set up to facilitate and coordinate these customer visits.  
They ensure that you do not impose on your customers  
—  

such as  
every team wanting to visit the same customers  
—  

and also that  
the appropriate account managers and customer success staff are  
kept in the loop. CHAPTER 38  
# Objections from the CEO and Board  
Note\: Much of this discussion is informed by  
chapter 26  
,  
“Partnering with Executives  
.”  
“As CEO, I meet with customers, investors, board  
members, analysts, and other company executives every  
day. How would I not be the appropriate person to decide  
what the product teams should deliver?”  
“I am the one responsible for the revenue, so shouldn't I be  
the one to define the product roadmap for delivering that  
revenue?”  
There is no question that as CEO, your activities put you in a very  
strong position to drive product. In fact, in most startups, the CEO  
or one of the other cofounders is usually also the head of product,  
and this is why.  
That said, innovation at scale is dependent on empowered teams,  
as customers, investors, board members, analysts, and other  
company executives generally don't know what is just now  
possible. So, the scalable solution is to push these decisions down  
to the relevant product team.  
But it's also true that some companies never manage to transition  
to the product model because the CEO does not want to let go.  
As long as things continue to go well, that may be for the best. But  
in most cases, the CEO is forced by the limited hours in the day to  
decide between running the product or running the company.  
“I am trying to run a business. I need to know what will be  
released, and when it will happen.” Yes, there's no question that as CEO you will need detailed, timely  
data on the progress of the major product work.  
Your product leaders should be able to tell you specifically which  
product work is expected to contribute to which business  
outcomes in what time frame. That is what they are doing in their  
product strategy work.  
Also, there will be cases where you will need high-integrity  
commitments. Just realize that there is an opportunity cost to  
these high-integrity commitments, so it is to everyone's interest to  
limit those to the major work that has true inherent deadlines.  
Similarly, the product teams depend on you to share the details of  
the strategic context so they can make good decisions within their  
teams when you are away on a business trip.  
“My board wants to see our product roadmap. I need to  
provide that to them.”  
If the board does not understand how your product work will  
result in the necessary impact to the business, then they will often  
ask for a product roadmap. But normally, it is not the product  
roadmap per se  
they care about. They want to see how the work  
they are funding in product has the potential to generate the  
hoped-for results.  
In this case, it is up to the product leaders to connect the dots  
between the product work going on and the hoped-for results.  
Before the board meeting, the product leader should be sure to  
spend enough time with the CEO, CFO, and CRO \(chief revenue  
officer/head of sales\) to ensure they all understand how the  
product work ties directly to the business results, and they have  
confidence that this work is the right work to generate the  
necessary results.  
It's also important to recognize that if the product organization  
does not have a track record of delivering these results, then there  
will be a period where this trust needs to be earned.  
“What if I have a product idea? Shouldn't I have a way to  
share that idea with the appropriate product team?” In healthy organizations operating in the product model, ideas  
from anywhere are normal and welcome.  
The question is whether that idea is being shared as a  
suggestion  
for one way to solve a problem, or as an  
edict  
for what to design  
and build next. CEOs are often surprised to learn that what they  
intend as suggestions are often interpreted as edicts. So, it's  
important to be explicit.  
More generally, as Steve Jobs often pointed out, the idea is the  
easy part. The real work is in seeing if that idea is any good, and  
then turning that idea into a real product \(which he considered  
“90 percent of the actual work”  
\).  
“What is a reasonable time frame in which to expect  
results from our product efforts? How do I know if a  
product team is struggling or if things are just par for the  
course?”  
To the first part of this question, the product strategy should spell  
this information out, ideally in written narrative form, so that all  
key  
parties understand the reasons for the major product work;  
how this work is intended to play out over the quarter and over  
the year; and how the work ties into the longer-term product  
vision.  
Regarding the second part of this question, there are different  
ways of assessing this. Many companies conduct quarterly  
business reviews with product teams for this purpose. Others ask  
their product leaders to dig deep with each product team every  
quarter and then report on the status and what actions are being  
taken to help teams that are struggling.  
“I want to make sure our organization is in alignment. We  
need to make sure that product, marketing, sales, service,  
and operations are all headed in the same direction and  
coordinated.” This alignment is the reason why many companies using the  
product model use the OKR tool to ensure alignment on an annual  
and quarterly basis.  
As an example, if we have new products getting released, we want  
to ensure that marketing, sales, service, and operations are all  
doing their part to ensure the success of those new products.  
“The board says my investment ratios are off for my stage  
company. They want more investment in sales \(direct  
correlation to revenue\) versus product \(where revenue is  
ill-defined\). How do I defend increasing resources in  
product and not in sales?”  
If product-market fit truly has been established, then increasing  
the investment in sales and marketing often is exactly the right  
move. However, many companies make the mistake of assuming  
that just because a company has a certain number of employees, it  
has achieved product-market fit. When the company has not,  
spending on sales and marketing is typically very inefficient.  
Several critical  
KPIs highlight this point, including how long it  
takes to sell and the costs to sell, the conversion rate of trial to  
purchase, and the customer churn rate.  
Until and unless product-market fit has been achieved, you need  
to focus as much of your resources as possible on getting to  
product-market fit. CHAPTER 39  
# Objections from Line of Business  
Note\: Line-of-business managers are stakeholders but, rather  
than representing just one functional area of the business, such  
as finance, HR, marketing, or compliance, line-of-business  
managers are responsible for a business unit. It may be a small  
business unit, such as a category manager in an e-commerce  
company, or a large business unit, in which case the title may  
be general manager. Many of the issues are the same as  
discussed in  
chapter 38  
, “Objections from the CEO and Board.”  
“I have P&L responsibility for this product line. So why  
would I not have control of the engineering resources?”  
There is no question that a line-of-business manager is a critical  
partner in the product model, in very much the same way that a  
CEO of a startup or scale-up plays a critical role. But just as a  
startup CEO would depend on her product and technology  
leaders, the line-of-business manager would want to do the same.  
In practice, just as with a startup, many of the most strategic  
decisions would be done collaboratively, such as product vision,  
product strategy, and identifying appropriate outcomes for the  
product teams.  
“Leadership expects that I know about anything that can  
impact my business. I need to know what's coming so I  
can answer those questions when they come to me. I don't  
want to look like I don't know what's going on.” Not only is this true, but leadership in the product model depends  
on informed, customer-focused, data-savvy, engaged leaders.  
Chapter 26, “Partnering with Executives,” speaks not only to why  
this is important but also to how we work to keep each other  
informed.  
It's essential that the line-of-business manager share with the  
product and technology leaders as much of the strategic context as  
possible.  
Similarly, it's essential that the product teams and product leaders  
share with the line-of-business manager as much information as  
possible, especially newly emerging insights and learnings from  
the product teams on the front lines.  
Most important, it's essential that product managers and product  
leaders connect the dots for the stakeholders about how their  
product work is intended to cause the desired business impact.  
“I find it so frustrating that the product team feels they  
need to repeat all the problem discovery that I've already  
done before they can get to work on the solution. And  
furthermore, because of that, too often there's no time left  
for solution discovery.”  
This is a common frustration. In hindsight, it should be clear that  
if you had been able to include at least the product manager and  
product designer in those customer interactions, you all would  
have  
learned the problem space together and the team could get  
right to solution discovery.  
But going forward, sit down with the product team and offer to  
share anything you can so they can quickly come up to speed on  
the problem space. Emphasize to them that they do need to  
understand the problem space in order to discover good solutions  
to those problems, but also remind them that customers buy  
solutions  
, so they need to have enough time to come up with a  
solution that is better than the alternatives on the market.  
“We need to move faster. Speed is critical. How can I get  
these product teams to feel the same sense of urgency I  
feel?” Speed truly is essential, but in the product model, we focus on  
time to money more than time to market. This is also referred to  
as  
outcomes over output  
.  
If the team builds something your customers don't buy, you will  
have spent a lot, but gained very little.  
The central idea of product discovery is to figure out very quickly  
and inexpensively a solution that is worth building—one that is  
valuable, usable, feasible, and viable.  
If your teams are not able to test out product ideas in at least one-  
tenth of the time it would take to build the product, they are doing  
something wrong.  
“The product team is resistant to showing their early  
prototypes to us as stakeholders, before they think it is of  
the necessary quality and ready for final review.”  
As trust gets built between the product team and the relevant  
stakeholders, this will improve. But anything you can do to  
encourage the early interactions is good. If the product team  
thinks you are interested only in final details, such as final colors  
or fonts, then they will push you off until those are ready. But if  
they see that  
you are able to look past the visual limitations of the  
early prototypes and to understand the direction the product is  
heading, and if you can provide thoughtful feedback that helps the  
teams to realize factors and constraints they may not have  
appreciated before, they will quickly come to value these early  
feedback sessions.  
“I prefer to have on my business team a set of people who  
report directly to me who can drive product initiatives.” In the prior models, when stakeholders are driving the product  
and IT is there to implement the features, often the business side  
ends up hiring essentially its own form of product managers. This  
is very understandable since the IT organization did not have this  
role or anything comparable.  
But now, in the product model, the last thing you want or need is  
duplicate organizations—product managers within the product  
organization and product managers within the business unit.  
Normally, when moving to the product model, you would draw  
from the best product management talent from all sources, but it's  
critical just to have a single capable and accountable product  
manager for each product team, and not split that role.  
There are cases where product managers do report to line-of-  
business managers, and then dotted line to a chief product officer.  
With the right leaders, this technique can work.  
But the main argument against this is that you want your product  
managers to report to product leaders who are skilled at  
developing strong product managers. Few line-of-business  
managers have the time or the experience to coach and develop  
their product managers to the degree that usually is required.  
“I run the business, so I should create the product  
strategy.”  
At a minimum, the line-of-business leader would collaborate  
closely with product leaders on product strategy.  
That said, usually the intention of the product strategy is to look  
holistically  
across the business units  
and work to maximize the  
value of the business as a whole.  
So, product leaders would work with each of the business unit  
leaders to ensure they are pursuing the best opportunities across  
the company, not just within each business unit.  
As discussed earlier, this requires trust and transparency. CHAPTER 40  
# Objections from Customer Success  
“Every day we deal with struggling customers. We are  
literally on the front lines. Yet the product teams seem not  
to care about what we think we need.”  
First and foremost, if a product team truly doesn't care about your  
needs, then that is a serious problem, and you should immediately  
bring this up with product leadership.  
That said, realize that product teams usually are getting pressured  
from every side to improve a product—directly from customers,  
from sales, from marketing, from operations, and from senior  
leadership, to name a few. So, it is very possible that the product  
team does care, but it can be difficult for them to hear the signal  
through all the noise.  
One technique that we encourage in this situation is for the  
customer success team to keep a single, live top-10 list of the ten  
most serious issues that are causing pain for your customers.  
For many organizations, this list can be derived from the tools  
used to track issues, but it is fine if this is a subjective list based on  
your judgment.  
This top-10 list does a great service to the product teams because  
they know that if an item is on this list, it is a serious issue, and  
they don't have to bother weighing it against everything else.  
It's important to realize that there will  
always  
be a top-10 list, but  
product teams should always be working to remove those items.  
It's also important to realize that sometimes product teams will  
address the problem with a solution different from how the  
customer or your customer success staff may have imagined. This  
is because, in many cases, the “obvious fix” has undesirable  
consequences, and the team must seek a different approach. This  
is normal, and all good, so long as the problem gets solved. “The tools we have to take care of our customers are  
pretty terrible. This not only makes our job harder, but it  
impacts our customers. We say we're supposed to care  
about our customers, but how do we address this?”  
Today, commercial tools available for customer success teams are  
better than ever before, so there's little excuse not to be using  
them. That said, there are areas that are not supported by  
commercial tools, and that's likely what we are talking about here.  
If the actual customer experience is impacted, then the tools you  
are using would be considered product \(even if the end customer  
can't see the tool\).  
It is true that many companies do struggle to staff these non-  
customer-facing products with the level of product team they  
would like, so you may have to be vocal about the importance of  
improving these tools.  
“We are talking to customers all day, and if we don't know  
when and how things are going to be changing with the  
product, how are we supposed to know how to help  
customers?” One of the consequences of very frequent, small, reliable releases  
is that often things are changing, and it can be hard to keep track  
of when certain capabilities have been deployed or made visible to  
customers.  
This has always been a challenge for companies, but with  
continuous delivery, the problem is exacerbated.  
To address the problem, product teams communicate with  
product marketing, and then you depend on product marketing to  
communicate with customers, sales, and customer success  
whenever anything becomes visible to customers or requires a  
change of behavior by the customer. The book  
LOVED  
describes  
several techniques to help with this.  
Occasionally things will slip through the cracks. It's important to  
understand why, so that the problem can be prevented in the  
future. But the major benefit of this approach is to significantly  
reduce, if not eliminate, disruptive changes for your users and  
customers.  
“Our product organization frankly takes too long to get  
products out, so our customer success team has staffed  
our own people to create solutions for customers.”  
While we applaud the initiative of a customer success team that  
takes things into its own hands on behalf of customers, this  
solution simply never ends well. Very soon, customers are running  
an unsupported blend of some products and some custom  
solutions—held together with lots of duct tape. Something new  
gets released and the nonproducts stop working.  
If your customers are forced to run a mix of supported and  
unsupported products—cobbled-together half-solutions—both  
your customers and your company lose.  
The right fix is to improve the product organization and the  
products produced, which is one of the reasons why companies  
move to the product model. CHAPTER 41  
# Objections from Marketing  
Note\: For the purposes of this chapter, we are combining all the  
different types of marketing—including product marketing,  
field marketing, corporate marketing, and brand marketing—  
into a single chapter  
.  
Note also that much of this discussion is informed by  
chapter  
23  
, “Partnering with Product Marketing.”  
“We interact with sales every day, we continuously  
monitor the competitive landscape, we conduct focus  
groups with current and prospective customers, and we  
have relationships with all the major industry analysts.  
Who better to define the products we need to succeed?”  
Indeed, this was how products were created in business software  
companies two decades ago. The reason companies moved on to  
the product model was because innovation was so rare in the prior  
model. That's because marketing, sales, customers, and even  
industry analysts don't know what's possible.  
Steve Jobs famously captured this reality by holding up his iPhone  
and stating  
“You can conduct 100 focus groups, you'll never get  
an iPhone.”  
Today, most marketing organizations understand  
this.  
That said, marketing does have very valuable data and insights,  
and product marketing managers work hard to get any  
information they consider potentially valuable into the heads of  
the relevant product managers and product leaders.  
“How can we best help the product teams to create  
successful products?” Product teams depend on many others across the organization,  
including sales, marketing, operations, and customer success, to  
name the four most obvious partners.  
Product marketing works closely with product teams, especially  
on the market-fit aspects of achieving product-market fit. But  
more generally, they work on sales enablement, messaging,  
positioning, evangelism, growth, and more. In certain cases, a  
product marketing manager is even embedded into product  
teams.  
But the main thing to keep in mind is if you believe the company  
has to fix the product to fix the problem, then you need to ensure  
you get whatever information is available into the heads of the  
relevant product managers who are responsible for changing the  
product.  
“Marketing wants to promote a future state of the product  
in advance of it being done. When is this okay?”  
There will be times when it makes sense to explain to the market  
\(and board members, investors, and prospective employees\)  
where you are heading  
before  
you are shipping those products.  
You do have to be careful because it's very easy to cannibalize your  
own sales, or create overwhelming pressure on your product  
teams before your new products are ready, or even truly  
discovered.  
You also have to be careful not to box yourselves in with claims  
and directions that you later realize are not what you need to do.  
The key is to not do this before you have the evidence that you will  
be correct. Whatever you do needs to be done in very close  
coordination among the head of product, the head of product  
marketing, and the chief marketing officer. CHAPTER 42  
# Objections from Finance  
Note\: Much of this discussion is informed by  
chapter 24  
,  
“Partnering with Finance.”  
“We need more flexibility in our spend levels. We want to  
be able to increase and decrease our technology  
investment depending on business results. Managing  
projects with outsourced vendors helps us do that.”  
“We need to keep our costs down, and the loaded cost of  
an outsourced engineer is significantly less than the  
loaded cost of our own employees.” If you look at the loaded cost on a  
per-engineer  
basis, then you  
will often find that outsourcing appears to be less expensive. But if  
you look at the loaded cost on a  
per–product team  
basis, the  
results reverse.  
A smaller team of  
employees  
usually outperforms a significantly  
larger team of outsourced staff. This is not a claim about the  
relative merits  
of the people involved. It is a consequence of the  
role and working relationship.  
And if you look not at  
projects  
but at achieving  
business outcomes  
, outsourcing is dramatically more expensive. In fact, most  
outsourcing firms refuse to even sign up for outcomes.  
Earlier we talked about there being two sources of value once you  
build something. There is the thing that you built, and there is the  
learning that accrues from building that thing. When the people  
are constantly changing and not contributing at more than an  
order-taker level, you do not get the value from learning you  
depend on.  
There are some occasional situations where temporary staff can  
make sense, such as for a specific integration or for a burst of  
work like for test automation, but, in general, if technology needs  
to be a core competency, this area needs to be insourced.  
More generally, it's important to understand that team stability  
plays a significant factor in both productivity and morale. It can  
be very disruptive and expensive for a member of a team to move  
to another team and need to learn the team's technology, problem  
and solution space, customer issues, and more. Normally it is  
better for you to expand the charter of each product team so that  
you can bring work to the relevant teams rather than move  
employees to the new work.  
“We need to identify any potential projects for the year  
and understand how much each potential project will cost  
as part of annual planning. That is how we can decide  
which ones to fund and move forward with.”  
“We need to be responsible with our money. We need to  
know what we'll receive for each project we fund. Otherwise, how can we possibly know what is a good  
investment and what is not?”  
This argument is definitely logical, but you probably have already  
figured out that the business cases you've historically been  
provided have been far from reliable in predicting returns. In fact,  
very few  
finance organizations even try to hold their people  
accountable to what they promised.  
This is why one of the most important lessons that product teams  
learn is to know what you can't know.  
With technology efforts, it's very difficult to know what a given  
effort will cost. It's even harder to know what revenue actually will  
be generated, as that depends entirely on how good the solution is  
and whether customers choose to use or buy it.  
You may notice that this situation is the same for professional  
investors of technology efforts—venture capitalists. They handle  
these unknowns by investing a small amount \(seed funding\) for  
the company to do their product discovery work. For those that  
show traction \(demonstrable progress\), then venture capitalists  
invest more substantially.  
More generally, in the product model, instead of funding  
projects  
,  
you fund  
product teams  
, and you hold them accountable to  
product outcomes \(business results\).  
“How do we hold product teams accountable for the  
results they commit to?” In general, you assign each product team one or more key  
problems to solve, and then you identify the key measures of  
success. You also tell teams how conservative or aggressive you  
would like them to be in pursuing solutions. This is part of the  
product strategy from your product leaders.  
Some teams might be asked for numbers that are very  
conservative and they are nearly certain they can deliver on, and  
others might be asked to be much more ambitious in their risk  
taking, knowing that it's unlikely they will succeed in this quarter.  
The accountability is a function of the certainty you ask of the  
teams.  
More generally, realize that each product team is contributing to a  
larger product strategy, and you hold product leaders accountable  
for the results of that product strategy.  
The product leaders are essentially placing a series of bets, and  
they succeed or fail at the end of each quarter or year based on the  
overall business results they are targeting.  
In any case, if and when a team clearly fails to deliver on one of its  
commitments, at a minimum, you conduct a postmortem—  
looking at the causes and potential remedies to prevent this issue  
from recurring in the future.  
“We need to be able to move resources between efforts as  
business needs dictate in order to make the best use of  
funds.”  
This comment also sounds logical, but, in practice, there is so  
much time needed to come up to speed on a new set of  
technologies, new types of customers, and new working  
relationships that shuffling resources turns out to be a very  
inefficient use of funds, and it dramatically reduces the team's  
ability to achieve outcomes as well as your chances of innovation.  
Instead, we prefer to staff product teams \(as opposed to project  
teams\) with a broader charter. Then those teams do all the work  
for all the projects and features related to their area.  
This approach keeps product teams stable, and leverages their  
growing expertise and efficiencies. “We need to see consistent positive progress every quarter  
to know which efforts we should continue to fund. Our job  
is to monitor that progress and impose that discipline.”  
Again, while this approach sounds logical, the curve for  
technology-powered products has a different shape. Experienced  
product leaders manage the product teams as a series of bets  
placed on specific technologies, specific people, specific skill sets,  
and specific data, and adjust each quarter based on the prior  
quarter's progress.  
“We are trying to understand how to treat product  
discovery from an accounting perspective. Is it research?  
Or is it just the definition and design stage of product  
development?”  
Discovery is  
not  
true research \(R&D\).  
Product discovery is an integral part of product development,  
analogous to the “definition and design” of earlier models.  
Product discovery is fleshing out the work that will be built and  
delivered in the coming  
weeks  
.  
When true research is needed, it is done outside of product  
discovery. CHAPTER 43  
# Objections fromHR/People Ops  
“These new job competencies are very disruptive to our  
company. We have many people in roles that no longer  
apply, and others where the scope of responsibilities has  
changed significantly. Changing job classifications is not  
minor, and there are considerable costs involved. We  
would rather leverage our current talent and stay with  
our existing job classifications.”  
“We have many people in roles that are close to  
technology, so rather than hiring product managers, can't  
we just change their titles to product management and  
send them to some training?”  
We understand that this change can be disruptive and potentially  
expensive. We also understand how the differences in the jobs  
might appear minor, given the legacy titles. But there is a reason  
why we  
say this is very often a major reason that transformations  
fail. We have never seen a company succeed when it insists on  
leveraging the current people and job classifications.  
It is also important to realize that not all your people will even  
want the new product manager role. It is a very demanding role,  
especially compared to the product owner or business analyst  
role.  
That said, if you have managers who are willing and able to do the  
necessary coaching \(admittedly a big  
if  
\), and if you have people  
who are eager to learn, then our first choice is to try to coach and  
develop these people. As a rule of thumb, a capable manager  
should be able to coach a reasonable candidate for a product  
manager role to competence in three months. If, after three  
months of sincere effort, the person still is not able to do the job  
that is required, then you need to find that person a different role  
and find someone capable to replace them. “We already have annual performance reviews, and now  
we're told we need to introduce ongoing assessments and  
coaching plans. Isn't this redundant and also very  
expensive?”  
Ongoing assessments and coaching plans are there to help your  
people learn the skills necessary to work in the product model.  
This is the primary responsibility of your first-level managers, and  
this coaching normally represents the manager's major  
responsibility. So yes, this is quite expensive,  
but it is not nearly  
as expensive as having all this staff who don't know how to  
succeed in their jobs  
.  
It is worth noting that companies that have a strong investment in  
coaching have higher employee retention rates, and can hire more  
staff directly from universities at lower cost.  
“We already have an onboarding program for new  
employees. Why do we need another onboarding program  
for product people?”  
Normally, these two types of onboarding programs cover very  
different topics. Everyone can benefit from a company onboarding  
program, but product people also have very role-specific training  
and education.  
“We have annual budgets for raises and promotions. Yet  
now we are talking about incentivizing managers to work  
to get their people promoted. How will this be paid for?”  
In the product model, you get extraordinary value from employees  
\(especially product managers, product designers, and engineers\)  
who can take on additional responsibilities, such as especially  
tough problems. Getting a larger number of people truly qualified  
for promotion up the job curve would be a very good problem to  
have.  
Managers tell their people that it is their job to get them ready for  
a promotion, but the company still will need to have roles and  
increased salaries available before promotions can be granted.  
“We want every employee to have individual OKRs.” For most roles in a company, having individual OKRs is fine. But  
members of product teams—especially product managers, product  
designers, and engineers—need to be incentivized to work  
together  
as a product team, collaboratively, on the very same  
problems with the very same measures of success. One of the  
main ways you do that is to assign OKRs to the  
product team  
rather than to the individual members.  
If you still want each person to have personal goals, this is much  
better incorporated into the coaching plans. CHAPTER 44  
# Objections from the CIO  
“I come from the school of thought where technology  
exists to serve the business. In fact, I pride myself on my  
ability to deliver on the needs of the business. I'm not sure  
where this move leaves me.” Moving to the product model is essentially about changing from  
viewing technology as a cost center to viewing technology as a  
profit center.  
We have worked with many CIOs who have expanded their skills  
to serve in this broader role \(sometimes titled as a combined  
CTO/CIO\). But these are the people who were eager to make this  
change—in fact, in several cases, they were ones who drove the  
move to the product model.  
It's important to point out that the product model is not just  
concerned with the technology that your customers interact with  
directly. There is usually a substantial amount of engineering  
work on technology behind the scenes—either in platform services  
or customer-enabling tools or internal tools.  
We realize there are some CIOs who do not wish to change. In this  
case, they would stay with the “true IT” vendor management and  
systems that run the business, and someone else is brought in to  
lead the broader product engineering.  
There are of course several similarities between the old model and  
the new model when it comes to technology, but there are also  
some important differences\:  
A product engineering organization is primarily there to  
build  
,  
while a true IT organization is usually more about integrating  
vendor-supplied systems \(  
buy  
\).  
There can also be some significant differences in scalability and  
performance requirements for the two types of systems. \(IT  
supports hundreds or maybe thousands of users, while product  
engineering often supports systems one, two, or even three orders  
of magnitude larger\).  
These differences usually drive differences in engineering job  
descriptions and pay scales.  
Another very important difference is that in true IT, outsourcing is  
encouraged as true IT is not the company's core competency. But  
in product engineering, outsourcing your engineering is generally  
fatal to any chance of innovation. “I'm currently a CIO but I want to lead this change to the  
product model, and I'd like to expand my role to CTO.  
Where can I learn more?”  
Some excellent product and engineering leadership coaches can  
help you with this transition.  
There are also excellent CTO bootcamps designed to share best  
practices and the latest techniques. CHAPTER 45  
# Objections from the PMO  
Note\:  
PMO  
here refers to the program management office,  
which is essentially a project management function with  
senior-level visibility.  
“My understanding is that many of the marquee product  
model companies have a project or program management  
function. What role do they play in the product model?”  
Not only do many marquee companies have the project or  
program managment function, but the function plays an essential  
role in the companies. When building large, complex products,  
especially ecosystem products, there are many moving pieces and  
there are a very large number of dependencies and impediments.  
The project management role is key to managing these  
dependencies. The issue is not with the role; it is with the culture  
behind how the company provides that role.  
The problem comes when the PMO, under the guise of reporting  
on status, exists to instill and govern a command-and-control  
culture.  
When the PMO is there to provide servant-based  
delivery  
management  
, it is providing a major dependency tracking and  
impediment removal service to the teams, but in a way that is  
empowering rather than disempowering.  
“I come from the school of thought where everything is  
about predictability. We need to focus on delivering what  
we say, when we say. We let the business leaders worry  
about what gets built, and we focus on being a reliable  
and trustworthy machine for delivering what is  
requested.” This is a good summary of the old model. But in the product  
model, the focus is no longer on predictability but rather  
innovation. Predictability is important only if it delivers the value  
the company depends on. So, the product model is based on a  
very different set of goals and priorities, often characterized as  
time to money rather than time to market.  
This is why the PMO often has a difficult time with the change to  
the product model.  
In many companies, the people in the PMO can make this  
cultural change and serve as effective delivery managers, but in  
others they cannot, and some decide to leave.  
This is one of the more difficult situations in transformation,  
because in most cases, the people are there to do a job, and there  
are just differences in how that job is done. But in the case of a  
PMO, this is more of a cultural and process view that's largely  
incompatible with the product model.  
“What are we supposed to do if we are no longer playing  
the program management role?”  
Normally, you change the PMO to a delivery management  
organization. The focus is now on servant-based project  
management and impediment removal. With the right mindset  
and skills, delivery managers are very valuable to the  
organization.  
While old-style PMO is perceived as the enforcer of “the  
business,” delivery managers serve product teams, and product  
teams serve customers, in ways that work for the business.  
Just be very careful that you have people who truly understand  
and embrace this difference and are not merely biding time until  
there's a return to the older model. CHAPTER 46  
# Objections from Inside Product  
Note\: For the purposes of this chapter, these objections  
represent the broader product and technology organization  
\(product management, product design, engineering, product  
ops, and product leadership\)  
.  
“How can we be responsible for outcomes if we don't  
control all the people necessary for delivering on that  
outcome—sales, marketing, services, and so on?”  
This is a very common objection, and it's also very  
understandable. One way of addressing it is to focus the key  
results on product outcomes that are largely in your control. But  
you do need to be careful here because it's important that the  
product team take some real responsibility for the success of the  
product. The original motivation for OKRs was to encourage  
product teams to get out of the office and figure out what needs to  
change. Is there a problem with  
the marketing or with the sales?  
Maybe the sales tools? Or is the problem with the product not  
doing what it needs to do in the customer's environment?  
Think of it this way\: Who in the entire company has more of an  
ability to impact the products than the product teams? Think of  
the salesperson who depends on selling the product for their  
livelihood, yet has little to no control of the actual product.  
“It is very expensive for us to do a release of the necessary  
quality. How can we possibly afford to do these releases  
much more frequently? Throwing more people at the  
problem doesn't necessarily speed the process up—it can  
actually slow it down further.” True enough, more people are rarely the answer for smaller, more  
frequent releases. This is definitely a case of working smarter, not  
harder. There is a saying in the engineering community\: “If it  
hurts, do it more often.” If you're doing monthly releases, it is  
going to hurt. But if you push yourselves to move to weekly  
releases, or even to daily releases, you will be forced to invest in  
your test and release automation, and soon you will remove that  
pain.  
The book  
Accelerate  
goes deep into the theory of why releasing  
frequently is both faster  
and  
results in higher quality.  
1  
“We are in a regulated industry. We're not allowed to test  
ideas on our customers, and we're not allowed to release  
this frequently.”  
“We are in a regulated industry. We need to follow formal  
processes in order to be compliant and responsible.”  
It is remarkable how many regulated companies think they  
operate under certain constraints that the actual regulations don't  
describe. There are different rules, and you need to read the  
relevant regulations yourself, then talk to your legal and  
compliance people to understand exactly what the constraints are,  
not just what's always been done. But we routinely get customers  
to sign documents indicating their understanding and agreement  
to running an experimental version. And, in fact, if you genuinely  
care about your customers and keeping the technology they  
depend on reliable, then you  
need  
to release small, frequent  
releases.  
But, in general, it's common that product teams can do much  
more than they think they can.  
“We don't have time to test product ideas. We just need to  
code and ship. We are fine letting the stakeholders decide  
what they want us to build.” If this approach worked, you would not need the product model.  
The irony is that this objection usually comes from engineers. Yet,  
in strong product companies, engineers know that they are the  
primary source of innovation, and they care just as much about  
what  
they build as  
how  
they build it.  
Your engineering leaders will need to actively coach the tech leads  
to make sure that engineers are in place who understand this.  
“Some of our engineers say they just want to be told what  
to build. Is there room for those people on a product  
team?”  
The short answer is yes. You do need to ensure that at least the  
tech lead cares as much about  
what  
they build as  
how  
they build.  
But if some of the engineers on the team just want to build, that's  
fine.  
The longer answer is that companies operating in the product  
model understand that engineers are the key to innovation, and so  
they focus their hiring on the types of engineers who don't just  
want to be told what to build.  
“If we test our product ideas with real users, then our  
competitors will find out what we're building.”  
First, companies that do product discovery only end up building a  
fraction of the ideas—the ones that work out well. So, anyone  
watching wouldn't know the results and what you decided to do.  
Second, if you are still nervous, you can have users sign an NDA.  
“What if we show an idea to a customer in product  
discovery and they get all excited, but then we decide not  
to build that?”  
This is a possibility, and you should explain to people you test  
with that you're just learning about what the best solution would  
be. But, more generally, you do this testing so that you can deliver  
valuable solutions to your customers.  
“When we do product discovery, we sometimes discover  
opportunities we think are a better use of our time than  
the problems we've been asked to solve. Why can't we pivot to pursue the larger opportunity? Isn't that what  
empowered teams are supposed to do?”  
First, if you discover an important new opportunity, you should  
absolutely raise it to your leadership. This opportunity may in fact  
be what the product strategy should focus on next.  
However, the current product strategy likely depends on you  
solving the problem you were asked to solve. So no, you can't just  
change what you're working on. Empowerment does not refer to  
working on whatever you like. It refers to being able to come up  
with the best solution to the problem you've been asked to solve.  
“We are trying our best to please all our various  
stakeholders, but it literally seems impossible to give  
them all what they want, as well as deliver on the  
outcomes we're expected to achieve. It feels like we're  
being set up to fail.”  
It is true that sometimes solving for all parties is especially  
difficult. Some of the innovation stories in this book have  
highlighted such cases, and you can see how the team worked  
through the conflicts. But normally, product teams have one or at  
most two problems they're trying to solve, plus their keep-the-  
lights-on work. If you still feel you're being set up to fail, this is  
important to discuss with your manager. Remember that in team  
objectives, the product team says what they think they can  
accomplish. So, you are very much in control of this.  
“So much of what we want to do depends on other product  
teams, and we can't control what their priorities are. Even  
small things take too much coordination work. This  
situation certainly doesn't feel empowered.” This is a common consequence of a poorly designed team  
topology, and also of a large amount of technical debt.  
Nevertheless, since it is very common, it's important to discuss  
what you can do about the situation now, while simultaneously  
addressing your tech debt and considering more substantial  
changes to your team topology.  
First, consider the possibility of increasing your team size, as it's  
likely that a smaller number of somewhat larger teams would  
leave everyone feeling both more empowered and more  
autonomous.  
Second, this is where delivery managers can be a real help. They  
can help track—and, when possible, resolve—the various  
dependencies and impediments.  
Third, you may want to consider expanding the use of platform  
teams. Platform teams do introduce explicit dependencies on  
them, but these dependencies are easier to manage and usually  
end up substantially reducing the total number of dependencies.  
This is often a step toward the necessary tech debt replatforming  
as well.  
“We have a hard time understanding what decisions we  
are allowed to make ourselves, which we are supposed to  
propose  
as a recommendation for approval, and which  
are simply ones that will come down from above.”  
This is a very normal question to ask your manager during your  
weekly 1\:1. Failing to do weekly 1\:1s is just another sign of much  
more serious issues.  
In general, when you consider decisions, you'll talk about risk and  
consequence. What is the risk, and what is the consequence of  
making a mistake? In many cases, the consequences are minimal  
and reversible, and as such are usually handled by the team.  
A simple and useful way to frame product decisions is Amazon's  
one-way \(nonreversible\) and two-way \(easily reversible\) door  
decision metaphor. “Sometimes we don't agree as a product team what the  
best decision is. How are we supposed to resolve these  
disagreements?”  
First, it's a normal and even healthy sign that the product team  
has different opinions and feels safe enough to share them.  
If the decision pertains to a specific area of expertise, you'll  
normally defer to the person with that expertise.  
If that doesn't resolve the dispute, the usual answer here is to run  
a quick test. Learn what the best answer is together.  
If you're unsure, this is a perfect question for a weekly 1\:1 with  
your manager so that you can discuss your specific situation.  
“We need a central role to control what all our  
commitments are and what all the various dependencies  
are and expected dates. If we don't have a PMO, how will  
this be done?”  
It is very common for the head of engineering to review and  
personally approve all high-integrity commitments because  
ultimately their reputation is on the line.  
As to tracking dependencies and related dates, you should have  
delivery managers who help you with this and who help remove  
impediments that get in the way of delivering.  
“A specific product team keeps complaining that it takes  
most or all their time to just do the keep-the-lights-on  
\(KTLO\) work.” This problem is unfortunately common and very real. There are a  
few factors to consider\: What is the actual level of KTLO work? Is  
this an ongoing issue or just temporary? Is this a platform team  
\(there to enable other product teams\) or an experience team  
\(either customer-facing or customer-enabling\)?  
What percentage of the team's time is going to this keep-the-  
lights-on work \(up to 30 percent is normal for an experience team  
and up to 50 percent is normal for a platform team\).  
If the situation is ongoing, and if the average is above the  
guidelines just listed, the normal fix is to add one or more  
engineers to the team so that the overall percentage of keep-the-  
lights-on work is back in proportion.  
If adding engineers is not an option, then since KTLO work is, by  
definition, not optional, you would need to reduce the non–KTLO  
work for this team. Doing this will negatively impact morale as  
well as this team's business impact, but it may be unavoidable  
until additional help is found.  
“Some engineers believe it would be faster for them just to  
build something in order to test it.”  
Sometimes this is true, and it's a win when it is. But more often  
than not, engineers who believe this have not been exposed to or  
trained on the modern techniques to very quickly create testable  
prototypes.  
But assuming the team is skilled, then if the engineers can build  
something in production faster than can be prototyped in  
discovery, and so long as those engineers are okay with throwing  
the code away if the product idea doesn't work, then this is fine.  
“The engineers are complaining that the product manager  
and designer are not including them in their discovery  
work other than to tell them what to build in the end.” This is one of the most common problems, and the result is not  
simply lower morale on the part of the engineers. An even larger  
issue is the lack of innovation that happens in this model. We  
encourage engineers to first speak about this directly with the  
product manager and product designer. If that doesn't help, this is  
one of those occasions when an escalation to a product leader is  
important.  
“The team is complaining that they're being asked to  
provide dates for everything.”  
This situation is usually correctable with some discipline. First,  
make sure that everyone knows there is a procedure that is always  
followed when dates are needed. This procedure is called a  
high-  
integrity commitment  
, and it requires time from the engineering  
tech lead and potentially additional engineers.  
Second, make sure everyone understands that these high-integrity  
commitments take some time to produce—there is an opportunity  
cost to coming up with this date.  
Third, work to educate the organization as to when a date is truly  
necessary versus when it is not. Explain that high-integrity  
commitments are meant to be the exception and not the rule.  
“The team is struggling with so much technical debt that  
even small items become major, taking a big toll on  
morale as well as results.”  
This very serious situation will require senior product and  
technology leaders to work with the executive team to get a  
recovery plan in place. Specialty firms can help with your plan for  
digging yourselves out of this tech debt hole, but doing so is still  
painful, and many companies don't survive this situation.  
There is too much involved to discuss here, but normally it will  
take one to two years to get back on track, and that's if things are  
managed well.  
“The team thinks there's no time actually to test the risks  
before building.” In the product model, we often talk not so much about time to  
market but instead time to money. In other words, what matters  
most is achieving the necessary results. If you don't test the risks  
before building, you will very likely spend the next several months  
building something that will not achieve the necessary results.  
Then you'll have to go through the same cycle again, usually  
multiple times.  
In contrast, testing those issues with prototypes instead of  
products—in hours and days, instead of weeks and months—  
normally will allow you to achieve time to money much faster than  
otherwise.  
More generally, it is not unusual, during even the first hours of  
product discovery, for the product team to realize that a solution  
is not good and is not worth building, which saves substantial  
wasted effort. It's worth noting that without this product  
discovery, the team would have to spend the time and money to  
build this solution only to find that it was not a good use of time.  
For this reason, most experienced product teams would argue that  
you don't have time  
not  
to consider the risks in discovery.  
“The discovery work and the delivery work are out of  
balance. Either the discovery work can't keep up or the  
delivery work can't keep up.”  
It's not unusual for product teams to get out of balance  
temporarily—perhaps a week or two at a time—but if the problem  
is sustained, then it's typically a sign of either too few or too many  
engineers.  
If the engineers can't keep up with the discovery work \(there is too  
much work on the product backlog\), then it's typically a sign of too  
few engineers. If the discovery work can't keep up with the  
engineers, it's usually a sign of too many engineers.  
“The team is struggling with remote employees. Work is  
taking an unusually long time; team members don't feel  
included; psychological safety is dropping.” Many teams struggle with remote workers, and two techniques are  
effective for improving the situation\:  
First, arrange to spend some time working in person at least once  
every quarter. The location you select is less important than the  
duration and frequency of the in-person visit.  
Second, increase the 1\:1 coaching for the people who are  
struggling. Consider twice-a-week, 30-minute 1\:1s.  
“The engineering leader keeps moving people from team  
to team based on weekly or monthly needs and is not  
appreciating the importance of durable teams.”  
While it is possible that the product or engineering leader simply  
doesn't understand the importance of team stability or durability,  
more often this is a sign of a problem in the team topology.  
If a product team is scoped too narrowly, then teams will struggle  
with sizing. Instead, it is better to have larger teams with broader  
charters, and let the product teams themselves worry about how  
they pass around the various work to one another rather than  
move people between teams.  
“We have all these other people who were not covered in  
your product model competencies. They include product  
owners and business analysts. How do they fit in the  
mix?”  
The short answer is that they don't. The product model does not  
have these other people on the product team.  
The product owner is a role, not a job, and that role is meant to be  
covered by the product manager.  
In the product model, the business analyst responsibilities move  
partially to product managers and partially to product designers.

# Innovation Story\: Kaiser Permanente  
Marty's Note\: Many people believe that it's effectively impossible to  
innovate in regulated industries, or in large, complex  
organizations, or in companies with many different stakeholders. I  
love this example because it proves all these people wrong. While by  
no means easy, with the right leadership and motivation,  
innovation absolutely is possible, as you'll see here  
.  
# Company Background  
Kaiser Permanente is one of the nation's largest nonprofit healthcare  
and health coverage organizations, serving more than 12 million  
patients.  
In 2019, Kaiser Permanente's digital organization embarked on a  
large-scale transformation to the product operating model.  
The organization built out a digital product and technology group  
with an initial focus on reimagining the patient health journey and  
streamlining the patient's digital health experience.  
Product teams organized around the patient journey, and those  
teams helped automate manual processes and streamline digital  
experiences, resulting in improvements in patient satisfaction, better  
adherence to medication and care plans, and improvements in  
operational efficiency.  
Then, within a year of launching the transformation effort, the  
COVID-19 pandemic began.  
Almost overnight, Kaiser Permanente's care delivery approach had to  
change due to the public health emergency and the significant  
limitations impacting in-person care.  
The Problem to Solve The company had certain telehealth options in place for several  
years. However, the existing telehealth solutions had some  
fundamental constraints.  
The existing telehealth offering was available only during normal  
business hours, requiring patients to visit in-person urgent care  
centers and emergency departments for after-hours care.  
Patients could schedule a telehealth appointment only in their home  
markets, preventing them from receiving virtual care when away  
from home.  
A combination of technical, regulatory, clinical, and operational  
constraints prevented telehealth from being offered in a consistent  
manner across the company's many markets.  
The potential for care gaps to increase during the pandemic was very  
real.  
Kaiser Permanente urgently needed a way to expand its care delivery  
approaches so patients could receive the care they needed.  
The company needed a technology-powered solution that would  
enable patients to get access to the right care, at the right time, no  
matter the market they lived in, or their ability to get to a medical  
office, or the time of day  
.  
This effort became known as  
Get Care Now  
, providing a single,  
nationwide, 24/7, on-demand virtual care solution for patients.  
# Discovering the Solution  
The product organization understood that there were very  
substantial product risks involved.  
The priority and motivation were to meet patients' needs during the  
increased health risks brought on by the pandemic.  
From the patient perspective, there would be important usability  
risks, as patients bring a wide range of comfort with technology, and  
they may also be experiencing substantial stress during the times  
they need care. Patients needed both to understand how to use the service and to  
decide to use the service over what they were already familiar and  
comfortable with\: visiting a clinic or emergency room.  
From the perspective of the care provider \(physicians and medical  
staff\), these clinicians needed to learn and understand this new  
avenue of care and be sure they could deliver the necessary patient  
experience before, during, and after the telehealth visit. Beyond the  
actual experience clinicians provide to the patients, very specific  
medical, regulatory compliance, and operational needs exist.  
As the online experience would be new for patients and clinicians,  
the product teams needed to learn the expectations and behaviors of  
both groups as they interacted virtually. How long would patients be  
willing to wait for an appointment? What conditions would be best  
suited to a virtual session, and which would require an in-person  
examination?  
The product teams collaborated closely with clinicians and business  
operations to explore potential solutions and approaches that would  
meet the needs of patients and care providers, as well as operational  
and compliance needs.  
To keep things simple and intuitive for patients and to prevent long  
wait times, the product teams would need to solve some very  
complex challenges on the operational side, such as making sure a  
physician licensed to provide telehealth in that specific regional  
market was available. In terms of infrastructure, the company  
needed to ensure clinicians were equipped with the technology  
necessary to securely interact online with patients from either a  
medical office or their own homes.  
Product teams worked side by side with clinicians and operations,  
identifying critical operational constraints related to which clinicians  
were staffed as well as how they documented the care interactions  
and enabled handoffs between clinicians. In addition, clinical  
protocols around acuity \(severity of illness\), triage, assessments, and  
documentation were identified and incorporated into the patient and  
clinician experiences.  
The key to the critical solution discovery was the product teams  
partnering closely with the clinical and operations teams in each of the company's regional markets. The teams employed continuous  
ideation and rapid testing to converge on solutions that addressed  
the needs of each of the critical parties.  
As the many operational issues were addressed one after the other,  
the teams focused on the remaining technical feasibility risks.  
Critical challenges existed in integrating underlying scheduling and  
medical health records systems as well as clinician tools.  
Further, with more than 12 million patients, the solution needed to  
be truly scalable.  
Key data around clinician capacity, appointment schedules, and  
patient health information needed to be extracted and aggregated to  
support  
Get Care Now  
.  
Once the product teams believed they had discovered and validated  
an end-to-end solution that addressed the many product risks, they  
built and quality-tested the product, began a gradual rollout of the  
solution across all their existing markets, and later expanded  
nationwide.  
Remarkably,  
Get Care Now  
was created in only four months from  
inception to launching the new experience across the company's  
markets. With actual usage data being collected from patients and  
clinicians after deployment of the experience, the next iteration was  
implemented and deployed three months later.  
# The Results  
Since the full launch of  
Get Care Now  
, Kaiser Permanente's patients  
have had 24/7 access to virtual care from their care providers online  
in every state nationwide.  
Most important, member satisfaction was 9.6 out of 10, with a  
remarkable 88 percent net promoter score. More than 36 percent of  
members using the service are seen after hours—between 5 p.m. and  
8 a.m.—saving many of these patients from needing emergency room  
visits and reducing the strain on that resource.  
More generally, too many people believe that in regulated industries  
like healthcare, it is impossible to do this level of technology- powered innovation in any amount of time, let alone in just a few  
short months.  
Kaiser Permanente was able to demonstrate this ability to  
themselves, to their senior leadership, and to the broader industry,  
providing real value to their patients and to their many dedicated  
care providers. PART XI  
# Conclusion  
The purpose of this part is to connect the dots between all the critical  
points discussed thus far, including the common themes from the  
successful transformation case studies. CHAPTER 48  
# Keys to Successful Transformation  
In this chapter, we want to share what we have come to believe is  
essential in order for a company to effectively and successfully  
transform.  
We have discussed each of these key concepts in this book.  
Everything we have described is meant to increase your chances of  
success, but it's also true that not everything is equally critical.  
Here we put the focus on the ten things we consider to be most  
critical for increasing your chances of success.  
# 1\. The Role of the CEO  
While theoretically not impossible, it is extremely difficult to  
transform successfully without the active support of the CEO. The  
other items on this list will make obvious why this is the case.  
And to be clear, when a CEO decides just to designate some leader as  
being responsible for “digital transformation,” that is not what we  
are talking about. This common mistake makes it all too easy for the  
rest of the company to continue business as usual.  
Understand that while product management, product design, and  
engineering may be at the center of this transformation, the impact  
necessarily goes far beyond the product organization.  
It's not unusual to find that you also need fundamental changes to  
finance, human resources, sales, marketing, customer success,  
business operations, and more, and occasionally the CEO will need  
to get involved.  
More generally, the CEO really needs to be the chief evangelist of the  
product model.  
2\. The Role of Technology At its most fundamental, a successful transformation changes the  
role of technology from a necessary cost to the core enabler of the  
business. This mindset impacts nearly everything—from how  
technology is funded to how teams are staffed, and whether  
technology is considered a core competency or something that can be  
outsourced.  
# 3\. Strong Product Leaders  
Assuming the necessary support from senior leadership, and that's a  
very big assumption, then everything depends on strong product  
leaders. Specifically, these are the people who lead product  
management, product design, and engineering.  
The importance of this can't be stressed enough.  
These are the  
people who are responsible and accountable for everything that  
follows  
.  
You'll need to be sure either that you have experienced leaders who  
know how to work effectively in the product model or, at the very  
least, that they have product coaches to help them through the  
upcoming transformation work.  
# 4\. True Product Managers  
Empowered product teams depend on competent product managers.  
For most companies that are trying to transform, even if they  
currently have people with this title,  
this is a new competency  
.  
While companies often have people with the title “product manager,”  
that title can be very misleading as true product teams have very  
different demands on the product manager than the feature teams  
they are replacing.  
Here is where experienced product leaders are so essential. These  
leaders need to determine which people are more suited to other  
roles and which have the potential through coaching and training to  
become the true product managers that the stakeholders need to  
truly partner with. To be explicit, the senior leadership team should believe that each  
product manager is a potential future leader of the company.  
To be even more explicit, product leaders will be judged based on  
their weakest product manager.  
This product leadership is not a minor role, and it requires strong  
people with a deep understanding of your customers, the data, your  
business, the market, and the technology.  
# 5\. Professional Product Designers  
As the product model puts users and customers much closer to the  
product teams and to the company, product designers have the skills  
to help you craft customer experiences that your customers love. This  
is why we elevate design from a supporting role to a central role,  
alongside product managers and engineers.  
# 6\. Empowered Engineers  
Empowered engineers form the engine that fuels consistent  
innovation. Much of effective transformation is all about enabling  
and encouraging truly empowered engineers.  
Just in case it's not blatantly obvious, you won't have empowered  
engineers if you outsource your engineers.  
No one is suggesting that you put your engineers on a pedestal, but  
you need to get them out of the proverbial basement and put them  
front and center on your product teams and in coming up with  
solutions to the hardest problems you face.  
# 7\. Insights-Based Product Strategy  
The purpose of your product strategy is to determine the most  
important problems that need to be solved for the company to  
achieve its objectives.  
Most companies that have yet to transform have never created a  
product strategy before. That's because their strategy was simply to serve as many of the business stakeholders as they could. And, of  
course, that's not a strategy at all.  
Yet an effective product strategy, based on both quantitative and  
qualitative insights, is key not only to leveraging the talents of your  
people but to getting the most out of your technology investment.  
Your product leaders are responsible for this product strategy—yet  
another reason why it's so important to have experienced and strong  
product leaders.  
# 8\. Stakeholder Collaboration  
One of the most difficult aspects of a successful transformation is  
redefining the relationship between the product organization and the  
different parts of the business.  
The reason it's difficult is because it represents a real change for  
many key stakeholders.  
Fundamentally, transformation involves moving from a model where  
the technology teams exist to serve the business to one where they  
exist to serve the customers, in ways that work for the business.  
To be explicit, that means moving from a  
subservient  
model to a  
collaborative  
model.  
Most stakeholders are frustrated with the old way of working, so  
they're at least willing to try to transform, but some likely will take  
the loss of control personally. Product leaders and product teams  
need to be sensitive to this issue.  
It's essential that product leaders do not try to push this change until  
and unless product teams have competent product managers who  
are ready to step up and do what they need to. But once these  
competent product managers are in place, they may need the active  
support of senior leadership to help stakeholders through this  
change to the collaborative model.  
It's important not to sugarcoat this, as the change is profound.  
9\. Continuous Evangelization of Outcomes Yet another critical responsibility of your product leaders is  
continuous evangelism. They need to evangelize the product vision,  
the product strategy, the importance of moving the focus to  
outcomes, and the broader transformation to the product model.  
The product vision is the inspiration and motivation for the work and  
combined efforts of the whole organization.  
The product strategy is critically important to evangelize because it  
makes transparent the rationale and the evidence for what will get  
done and what won't.  
More generally, product teams are learning every week as they work  
on product discovery for the problems they are being asked to solve.  
It's important to share the learnings honestly and openly so that the  
broader company can understand how learning happens, where the  
innovations are coming from, and what it means to truly deliver  
business results versus just shipping features and projects.  
# 10\. Corporate Courage  
There is no question that successful transformation is difficult. We  
hope that this list helps illuminate specifically why that's the case  
and what needs to be tackled in order to succeed.  
However, the list would not be complete without acknowledging that  
every case of successful transformation we know of required true  
courage from executives and other senior leaders.  
Moving to a fundamentally different model—even when the current  
model is broken—requires a real leap of faith, and it takes courage to  
make the leap. Often, the very senior leaders of companies that  
transform don't get the recognition for this courage they deserve  
\(although the stock market has rewarded them very well\). But still,  
we know many more senior leaders who don't have the courage and  
aren't willing to do what it takes to help their company not just  
survive, but thrive.  
We hope that these ten keys provide a deeper sense of what's  
required to successfully and effectively transform your company to  
the product model. But What Can I Do?  
We realize that, in many cases, the first person in a company to  
read this book may be an individual contributor or one of the  
product leaders.  
It may be very clear to you that your company is in desperate  
need of change, yet you might feel like you're just shouting into  
the wind.  
It is true that to succeed in moving to the product model, you  
really are going to need the active help and support of the leaders  
of the company, or at least your business unit.  
While we hope this book finds its way into the hands of many  
more CEOs, there are still things that you can do, even as an  
individual contributor.  
Here's what we suggest\:  
1\. Talk to the rest of your product team to see if they are up for  
doing this with you. If it's just you, then your first job is to try  
to convince your team of the benefits.  
2\. Once they are with you, focus on upskilling yourselves to the  
new product model competencies described in the book. At  
an absolute minimum, learning these new skills will only  
help your careers.  
3\. Once you feel like you have some new skills and you'd like to  
try them out, go to your manager and ask if the company  
would be willing to let your product team serve as a pilot for  
this new way of working for the next quarter or two.  
4\. Suggest you focus on changing how you build and changing  
how you solve problems.  
5\. If the experiment goes well, hopefully it will spread. If it  
doesn't, you have contained the risk to just your team. CHAPTER 49  
# Innovation Story\: Trainline  
Marty's Note\: As you saw earlier, the Trainline product leadership  
built a very strong product organization, capable of the consistent  
product innovation they needed. Of all the examples of their skills,  
this story is my favorite. You can see each of the product model  
competencies and product model concepts in action as they tackle a  
very difficult problem, but one that promised real value for their  
customers, their rail partners, and their company. The level of  
product innovation described here rivals anything I have seen at  
the world's most famous tech product companies  
.  
# Company Background  
After working through the transformation described in  
part V  
,  
Trainline now had capable engineering, product management, and  
design, along with a strong product vision and product strategy. The  
company also was starting to see real payoff from its investment in  
data science.  
Trainline had built successful and effective real-time train location,  
estimated platform departures, personalized disruption alerts,  
and  
the ability to find less congested carriages, all of which helped to  
bring their vision to life.  
But one major issue in particular continued to frustrate and concern  
their customers\: pricing.  
# The Problem to Solve  
From an early stage, it was clear that the perceived expense of rail  
tickets was hindering Trainline's ability to attract more customers.  
Customers would tell them, over and over, “Tickets are so  
expensive!” Conversely, the industry would counter that this was simply not true,  
pointing to the fact that tickets for every route were on sale at  
extremely low prices. Understanding this apparent schism had the  
potential to result in further strong innovation, but with millions of  
potential journey possibilities, it would also be significant work.  
It was also an issue that, on the face of it, the company had little  
control over\: Trainline received prices in real time the moment a  
customer executed a search. Only then would an operator's API  
expose the price for that specific individual journey.  
However, Trainline's head of data science was convinced that such  
an important problem was worth an investigation.  
# Discovering the Solution  
What the team discovered gave another truly unique insight\: Yes,  
tickets were cheap, but not so cheap that a significant percentage of  
customers wanted, or needed, to buy them.  
Initially starting with a smaller data set and then validating the  
conclusions at scale, the team proved that prices were  
not  
linked to  
yield. They were instead linked directly to days to departure. Buying  
early meant cheaper tickets were available, but purchasing later—  
within two weeks of a planned departure—resulted in steep rises. The  
increases uncovered sometimes were eye watering.  
While the industry was loudly promoting the lowest-priced tickets,  
the vast majority of customers had to pay significantly more.  
The  
team could find no evidence of smart yield management or  
automated last-minute sell-offs. This was a significant insight—and  
potentially a big win. The team was now able to understand the exact  
price savings for buying tickets early, on any route.  
The question now was\: Could they figure out a way of showcasing  
this information to customers in real time, helping them make more  
informed choices and saving money?  
While the opportunity was clear, the viability risks were significant.  
Trainline was a large and growing part of a much wider industry. Its  
rail partners were critical to its mission. Shouting loudly about Trainline's newfound ability had maximum potential to alienate  
those the company relied on to trade.  
Would the solution be valuable and usable enough to result in a real-  
world change of behavior? Would Trainline be able to scale it  
accurately? With so much information baked into the mobile real  
estate, could the company design an experience that made sense?  
But above all, the significant question remained whether Trainline  
would be able to launch without causing its partners—the rail  
companies—to convulse.  
This had maximum potential to blow up. Showcasing erroneous  
ticket prices could result in the immediate withdrawal of the  
company's license to trade. For that reason alone, the executive team  
—including the CEO—was brought into the viability conversation  
during discovery.  
The data scientists responsible for data discovery now joined forces  
with the app team, moving into a comprehensive product discovery  
effort.  
Addressing value risk first, the team hard-coded a thinly sliced  
solution, testing it in real time on a few select routes. The live-data  
prototype achieved unanimously positive feedback. These were real  
savings, and customers loved it. The team's confidence grew.  
In line with the desire for a premium mobile experience, the team  
had decided to make this solution unique to Trainline's apps. This  
directly reflected the company's vision and strongly supported its  
product strategy.  
Thanks to a highly capable design team, and intensive iteration and  
user prototyping, usability was unlikely to pose a major threat. But  
the bigger risks remained\: feasibility and viability.  
Accuracy was critical. This was a complex, big-data problem, even for  
a team with significant smarts. The team set the minimum bar in the  
high nines—there could be no risk taken with losing Trainline's  
license. The team worked diligently, and their ability to execute with  
extreme accuracy increased, bolstered by their rapid ability to  
performantly scale on AWS. One significant risk remained\: viability. While Trainline did not  
formally require approval from its partners, neither the team, the  
executives, nor the board would contemplate severe blowback from  
the industry, especially so close to a potential IPO.  
At the very least, exposing the pricing strategy that sat behind UK  
rail tickets would be controversial. Trainline could prove that it  
would result in customer savings, but given the company's now-  
significant market share, leaders started to worry that their solution  
could result in net industry revenue decline.  
They required real data, at scale. They were going to need to lean  
heavily on their small but expert operational team, comprising  
individuals who had spent years developing close relationships with  
their industry partners. Without them, the initiative likely was  
doomed to failure.  
Their ops team members were excited, but nervous, suggesting they  
focus their immediate attention on a smaller number of partners  
with a more progressive digital outlook. This work was nuanced and  
complex. Many partners refused, frustrated at yet another  
intervention from the upstart of the industry. But one agreed to a live  
test. Finally, the team had an opportunity to quietly launch and  
watch how the real data played out.  
# The Results  
The conclusions were extremely positive. As expected, the cohort of  
customers with increased flexibility started to purchase tickets  
earlier,  
making real savings and increasing their usage. They worked  
through the data carefully, confirming that the additional revenue  
derived from filling more seats more than offset the lower prices.  
Those who had saved money were ecstatic. The test had been an  
overwhelming success, allowing team members to make a firmer  
case for a \(still carefully managed\) wider rollout, which generated  
another chorus of positive free publicity.  
The release spoke directly to Trainline's mission\: to promote lower  
carbon transport solutions by offering the cheapest possible prices. It  
also gave the marketing team a significant new opportunity to showcase Trainline as the sole innovator within the sector. The  
various campaigns run were both timely, given Timeline's impending  
public listing, and highly effective. National media picked it up  
immediately, and a growing number of technology sites regularly  
included Trainline in their daily coverage.  
Internally, this success also gave the company another strong shot of  
confidence. Its price-prediction tool was just the latest example of a  
growing list of solutions that reflected Trainline's strong and  
maturing technology culture.  
Release by release, the company had achieved significant  
incremental value—not just for customers and the business but for  
shareholders. Just in time for the forthcoming IPO. Learning More  
One of the limitations of a physical book is that once it's printed, it's  
not something we can update. Yet we know we will continue to  
receive new questions and encounter new objections. If you have a  
question that is not discussed in this book, please see our living  
repository of questions pertaining to this book \(see

\).  
The Silicon Valley Product Group website \(  
https\://svpg.com/  
\) is  
designed as a free and open resource where we share our latest  
thoughts, learnings, and examples from companies operating in the  
product model.  
SVPG also holds workshops—both online and in-person—for product  
managers, product teams, product leaders, and company executives  
who wish to learn how to operate in the product model \(see

For companies that believe they need meaningful transformation  
across their technology and product organization to competitively  
produce technology-powered products, we also offer custom, on-site  
engagements. Acknowledgments  
This book is based on the lessons learned from the SVPG partners as  
we've spent the past 20 years helping companies move to the product  
model.  
We wanted to share what we've learned far beyond the relative  
handful of companies that we are able to work with personally.  
As we said earlier, nothing in this book was invented by us. We  
simply share what we have seen work in the top product companies,  
and we help others adopt those principles and behaviors.  
Much of our content is informed by the global product community.  
When we publish articles, give conference talks, and host webinars  
and workshops, we test out many of the techniques and case studies  
that we write about. People have always been generous with their  
feedback, and many send us additional questions. Much of this book  
was inspired by these interactions.  
While much of what we write about is inspired by the community, we  
work very hard to make sure we explain the concepts in the best way  
we can, and for that we depend on a set of expert reviewers. A very  
big thank you to Shawn Boyer, Matt Brown, Gabi Bufrem, Felipe  
Castro, Shreyas Doshi, Mike Fisher, Chuck Geiger, Stacey Langer,  
Michele Longmire, and Alex Pressland. Each and every one of them  
left their mark on this book.  
We would also like to thank the product coaches who allowed us to  
profile them in this book\: Gabi Bufrem, Hope Gurion, Margaret  
Hollendoner, Stacey Langer, Marily Nika, Phyl Terry, and Petra  
Wille.  
And on a personal note, this book would not be possible without my  
SVPG partners\: Lea Hickman, Christian Idiodi, Chris Jones, Martina  
Lauchengco, and Jon Moore. Each of them contributed original  
content and countless suggestions to this book. I must also  
specifically thank Chris, as he has literally been with me every single  
step of the way, and has become an integral and indispensable part  
of my writing process. Thanks also to my longtime editor, Peter Economy, and the publishing team at John Wiley & Sons. And  
finally, to Lynn for her love and support through now four major  
writing projects. About the Authors  
This book has been written by the five SVPG product partners.  
Our belief is that to lead an effective transformation to the product  
model, it is critical to have personally been there and done that, and  
to truly know what good looks like.  
That is why each partner has built products for decades, first as a  
product creator, and then as a product leader, at many of the most  
successful tech-powered product companies in the world.  
As a product partner for SVPG, we work with product organizations  
of all sizes, stages, and industries in order to help them learn how to  
leverage technology to create effective solutions for their customers.  
We do not employ junior partners or intermediaries. We also do not  
do the work for you. We work personally and directly with the people  
at every level of a company to help them learn the necessary skills so  
that they can lead their companies into the future.
