# METRIC HANDBOOK  
• Consistently updated since 2015 by expert authors in the field  
• Significantly revised in reference to changing building types and  
construction standards  
• New chapters added on data centres and logistics facilities  
• Sustainable design integrated into chapters throughout  
• Over 100,000 copies sold to successive generations of architects  
and designers  
• This book belongs in every design office.  
The *Metric Handbook* is the major handbook of planning and  
design data for architects and architecture students. Covering basic  
design data for all the major building types, it is the ideal starting  
point for any project. For each building type, the book gives the  
basic design requirements and all the principal dimensional data,  
and succinct guidance on how to use the information and what  
regulations the designer needs to be aware of.  
As well as buildings, the *Metric Handbook* deals with broader  
aspects of design such as materials, acoustics, and lighting, and  
general design data on human dimensions and space requirements.  
The *Metric Handbook* is the unique reference for solving everyday  
planning problems.

Welcome to the seventh edition of *Metric Handbook*.  
This latest version has been put together during the extraordi-  
nary times of the pandemic. As the vaccines roll out, it’s still far too  
early to know when society can return to anything like normality.  
Nor can we determine with any certainty what longer-term impacts  
Covid-19 may have on how we live our lives, and how we design  
our buildings.  
It’s a fair bet that some ways of doing things will never be the  
same again. In our substantially revised chapter on primary health,  
author Geoffrey Purves explores how the pandemic has accelerated  
substantial changes to how GPs operate their practices, with signif-  
icant implications for those architects working in this sector.  
An increased recognition of the importance of good ventilation,  
light and access to external space will have repercussions across  
a wide variety of building typologies. And as for the future of the  
office – the jury is still out on how many of us will return to a  
physical workplace full-time, and how the office type might evolve  
in response.  
The pandemic has also reaffirmed the importance of build-  
ing types such as data centres and logistics centres, which have  
enabled us to work, shop and play at home. In this latest edition,  
we introduce brand new sections on these vital typologies, along  
with another new chapter on retail, a sector also undergoing great  
change. Many more chapters have been extensively updated,  
including the one on fire safety, which sets out the still-evolving  
requirements following the Grenfell Tower disaster.  
While it will be some time before there is clarity on the pan-  
demic’s enduring impact on how buildings are designed, the need  
for high quality architecture has never been so high. The extra time  
spent working from home during lockdowns has shone a sharper  
light on the inadequacies of poorly designed dwellings – at a time  
when the link between poor living conditions and increased suscep-  
tibility to Covid-19 has become all too clear.  
Meanwhile, this publication will continue to play its part in  
promoting high quality design by bringing together best practice  
in design and planning across the building types. In doing so, we  
endeavour to provide authoritative guidance in uncertain times,  
creating a useful resource for both new entrants to the profession  
and to any architect tackling an unfamiliar building type.

February 2021 **Acknowledgements**  
This seventh edition of the *Metric Handbook* is greatly indebted to  
the time, effort, and expertise of its many contributors in revising  
and writing afresh the large number of updated chapters in this new  
edition. All their contributions are much appreciated.  
Particular thanks are due to the authors of the new chapters on  
data centres, logistics centres and retail, all sectors that have proved  
more vital than ever to help us cope with the pandemic and with-  
stand the lockdowns.  
The new edition would also not have been possible without  
commissioning editor Fran Ford and editorial assistant Trudy  
Varcianna at Routledge, as well as their editorial and production  
colleagues who all played such important roles in the publication  
of this updated new volume. **DESIGN BASICS** **1 Design information and dimensional**

# 1 DESIGN INFORMATION STANDARDS  
# 1.1 Production methods  
Historically, the production and sharing of project information was  
undertaken in a number of ways. This lack of a common approach  
was once thought to be a barrier to the adoption of new technolo-  
gies, and to the digitisation of the industry.  
# 1.2 Traditional drafting  
Today, traditional drafting by pencil and pen on tracing paper is  
not common within the architecture, engineering and construction  
\(AEC\) industry. Unlike CAD systems, it is not a flexible medium  
for editing quickly. While paper copies of documents can still  
be requested, many informed clients request ‘soft copies’ in pdf  
\(Portable Document Format\). As well as reducing storage space,  
this aids in archival search and is more sustainable because it uses  
less paper.  
# 1.3 2D CAD systems  
CAD is Computer-Aided Design. In simplistic terms, CAD is using  
a computer to assist with design by creating lines and arcs to rep-  
resent a building design. 2D can produce traditional plans sections  
and elevations, and also 3D drawings.  
# 1.4\. 3D Parametric modelling  
Parametric modelling is an approach to 3D CAD which has the key  
advantage that when setting up a 3D geometric model, the shape  
of model geometry can be changed as soon as parameters such as  
the dimensions or curvatures are modified. As a result, there is no  
need to redraw the model whenever it needs a change. Parametric  
modelling is not Building Information Modelling \(BIM\), although  
most BIM software platforms allow parametric modelling.  
# 1.5 BIM  
In an attempt to encourage digital ways of working, the Government  
Construction Strategy 2011 mandated the use of BIM to be adopted  
for all Government construction projects by April 2016. The  
overarching goals were to minimise waste in projects, encourage  
collaborative working and ensure all parties were using common  
data. This became known in the United Kingdom as BIM Level 02  
and has since been renamed the UK BIM Framework.  
BIM is a wide-ranging term that describes the process of cre-  
ating and managing digital information about a built asset. This  
could be a building, but the term equally applies to infrastructure  
projects. ISO 19650\:2019 defines BIM as\:  
Use of a shared digital representation of a built asset to facil-  
itate design, construction and operation processes to form a  
reliable basis for decisions.  
BIM involves more than the adoption of a 2D CAD or 3D  
object-based tool. It is founded on the development of a Common  
Data Environment for sharing information between the members of  
the design, manufacturing and construction teams.  
The creation of a geometric model as part of this process allows  
buildings to be conceived collaboratively and tested virtually,  
before they are built and operated for real. By building a digital  
model first, many of the challenges that occur on site regarding spa-  
tial coordination are anticipated with a resultant reduction in waste.  
BIM models are created from parametric objects and each object  
is defined only once and then placed in the model in multiple locations  
as required. If the object is then changed, these changes will appear  
throughout the model, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.  
An advantage of BIM is that it allows additional software  
applications to access common data. For example, software pro-  
grammes for sustainability design, project planning, cost and health  
and safety, can access and interrogate this common data to create  
information that is appropriate for a specific purpose.  
Ultimately, the aim for BIM is that the data can be used for the  
life cycle management of the facility and not just for the design and  
construction phase.  
BIM Level 02 was supported by a suite of Publicly Available  
Specifications \(PAS\) known as the UK 1192 series. Recently,  
the British Standards BS 1192 and PAS 1192–2\:2013 have been  
withdrawn and are replaced with BS EN ISO 19650 Parts 1 and  
2\. In addition, BS EN ISO 19650 Parts 3 and 5 were published  
in 2021.  
Guidance to assist practical implementation of BIM for the UK  
AEC industry was developed by AEC \(UK\) initiative in 2002. The  
latest version is AEC \(UK\) BIM Technology Protocol-v2.1.1.  
# 2 METRIC ANNOTATION  
# 2.1 Units  
The main units should be used as shown in Table I.  
On a drawing, either metres or millimetres should be used\: these  
units should not be mixed. If this rule is followed, ambiguity is  
avoided – it is not possible to confuse which units are intended.

Preferably write *tonne* in full to avoid being mistaken for imperial ton  
Force newton N N. n Note that when used in written text, the unit of newton is spelled out in full and  
begins with a lower-case letter ‘n’. When used as unit symbol, in calculation or  
in a formula it is then expressed as capital letter ‘N’  
Common practice is to use mm without a decimal, so 2 m is shown  
simply as 2000.  
# 2.2 Decimal marker  
The decimal marker \(full stop\) on the baseline is the standard deci-  
mal point in the UK; but the marker at the halfway position is also  
acceptable. It should be noted that continental practice is to use  
the comma on the baseline. The appropriate number of decimal  
places should be chosen depending on the circumstances in which  
the resulting value is to be used.  
# 2.3 Thousand marker  
To avoid confusion with the continental decimal marker, no thou-  
sand marker should be used. Where legibility needs to be improved,  
a space can be left in large groups of digits at every thousand point.  
Where there are only four digits, a space between the first digit  
and the others is not desirable \(e.g. 15000, 1500\). \(However, the  
comma is used in currency, e.g. £115,000.\)  
# 2.4 Notation  
As a rule, the sizes of components should be expressed in consist-  
ent and not mixed units, for example, 1500 mm × 600 mm × 25 mm  
thick and not 1.5 m × 600 mm × 25 mm thick. However, for long  
thin components such as timbers, it is preferable to mix the units,  
for example, 100 mm × 75 mm × 10 m long.  
It is important to distinguish clearly between the metric tonne  
and the imperial ton. The tonne is equivalent to 2204.6 lb while the  
ton is equal to 2240 lb – a difference of 1.6 per cent.  
The interval of temperature should be referred to as degree  
Celsius \(°C\) and not as centigrade. The word centigrade is used by  
the continental metric countries as a measure of plane angle and  
equals 1/10000th part of a right angle.  
# Examples

33 mm 3 cm 3 mm  
10.100 m 10 m 100 mm\*  
50.750 kg 50 kg 750 g  
Note\: Some metric values are expressed differently in certain countries. The value  
of 10.100 m, for example, could mean ten thousand one hundred metres and not ten  
metres one hundred millimetres, as in the UK.  
# 3 DRAWINGS  
# 3.1 Information required  
Table II indicates the typical drawings required during the design  
phases of a project. This relates to the RIBA Plan of Work 2020,  
which organises the process of managing and designing projects  
into a number of key work stages. The sequence or content of these  
stages may vary and/or overlap dependent on the procurement  
method selected – and the RIBA Plan of Work provides guidance  
on their applicability to the principal procurement routes.  
# 3.2 Graphic techniques  
Graphic techniques should follow the recommendations in BS EN  
ISO 9431 and in particular\:  
\(a\) \(b\) \(c\) \(d\) \(e\) Line thickness should be not less than 0.25 mm on drawings to  
be reproduced without reduction, or to be microfilmed.  
If different line thicknesses are used, each thickness should be  
at least twice the next thinner line.  
The space between lines should be not less than 0.7 mm.  
Inclined lines should be at an angle of 15 or a multiple of 15.  
Lettering \(including numbers\) should have a capital height of\:  
\(1\) \(2\) not less than 2.5 mm for drawings as in \(a\)  
not less than 3.5 mm for drawings as in \(b\).  
While these guidelines originally refer to manual drafting the  
same principles should ensure clarity when applied to plotted out-  
put from 2D CAD and 3D modelling systems.  
Line types, hatches and spacings are set out in BS EN ISO 128–  
2\:2020 Technical product documentation – General principles of  
representation.  
# 3.3 Drawing scales  
The internationally agreed and recommended range of scales for  
use in the construction industry is given in Table III.  
Where two or more scales are used on the same sheet, these  
should be clearly indicated.  
# 3.4 Traditional types of drawings  
Types of drawings at the most suitable scales are shown in  
Figures 1.1 to 1.7. Note that in Figures 1.5 and 1.6 alternative  
dimensional units are shown for comparison. The method of  
expressing dimensions as shown in the shaded drawings is not **Design information and dimensional coordination 1-3**

ing similar output but with the advantage of being able to edit, copy  
and rescale portions of the drawing set.  
# 3.5 Drawings from 3D systems and BIM  
2D building plans, sections and elevations can be created using a  
BIM platform. Derived from a single model, these have the added  
benefit of being automatically coordinated. The scale, location  
and cut planes of any particular view can be adjusted dynamically  
making the production of a drawing set extremely flexible. Of  
course, not everything needs to be modelled in 3D and it is com-  
mon practice to include conventional 2D details within the drawing  
set. Using callouts, these can be cross-referenced to their location  
on the model. Overall, this approach simplifies management of  
the drawing set helping to ensure that the information provided  
remains consistent.  
A typical system will allow the project model to commence  
with simple massing diagrams and evolve to fully detailed con-  
struction drawings. In particular, the concept of the single data  
model allows additional software to be employed for specific  
applications such as\:  
• Providing photo-realistic perspective still images and animated  
views of the project  
• Studying environmental planning issues such as sun paths,  
day-lighting, acoustics and escape simulations  
• Checking for clashes between structure, components and ser-  
vices. This may be carried out visually and in certain instances  
automatically at an early stage in the project to help avoid costly  
mistakes occurring on-site  
• Using the data as a basis for component manufacture.  
The case study at the end of this chapter illustrates some of the  
practical benefits of this approach.  
# 4 DRAWING CONTENT  
# 4.1 Standard elements  
Manual drafting was time consuming when edits or repetitive ele-  
ments were required. To address this, repeated standard elements  
**1.8** *Conventional shadings for various materials in section*  
# Design information and dimensional coordination 1-5  
**1.7** *Full size detail*  
and symbols were often introduced in the form of printed transfers.  
However, one of the advantages of CAD and now BIM platforms is  
that edits and repetitive elements can be carried out quicker. In 2D  
CAD, blocks are used for this purpose and can be scaled. With 3D  
CAD, parametric objects are employed for almost all of the draw-  
ing content and can be created to automatically generate different  
representations of elements and components that show a level of  
detail relevant to the chosen scale of a view.  
BS 8541–2 provides guidance and recommendations for 2D  
symbols and other graphic conventions for use on drawings for  
the construction industry. The symbols covered by this BS are  
restricted to the architectural and land registry symbols as the base  
for architecture drawing, modelling and planning activities. The  
more specific symbols for mechanical, electrical and plumbing,  
along with the structural steel sections and welding, are deferred  
to those institutes that have a greater understanding of the needs of  
their members in a fast changing world. BSRIA has a large sym-  
bol library for the MEP and Building Services engineers and the  
Institution of Engineering and Technology \(IET\) covers both elec-  
tronic and electrical symbols.  
The BS stresses that\:  
The amount of detail in a simplified representation should be  
limited to the essential attributes of the object. **1-6 Design information and dimensional coordination**  
A geometric shape should not be used if its meaning is not deter-  
mined by context and experience.  
Over-complexity of building elements components and sym-  
bols should be avoided by one of the following methods\:  
\(a\) Omitting unnecessary information \(for example, if all the  
items in a project are of the same type\)  
\(b\) \(c\) Annotating differences between one item and another  
Referring differences to a schedule or other document.  
# 4.2 Conventions  
BS 8541–2 specifies certain traditional symbols for use on draw-  
ings. A selection of these are shown in Figure 1.8.  
# 4.3 Symbol representations  
In object modelling systems, the representation of a symbol may  
be created so that it changes automatically depending on the scale  
of the output. BS 8541–2 includes a comprehensive set of tables  
showing standards for typical symbols, elements and components,  
Table IV, and for levels on plan, sections and elevations, Table V.  
# Table IV Standards for typical symbols, elements and components  
**Table V Levels on plan, section and elevation** **4.4 Scales and representations of elements**  
CAD and BIM platforms require the user to draw at 1\:1 full size  
scale. The level of detail shown to represent a building element  
varies depending on the representative scale of the final output\: if  
the detail is too complex it may not be possible to reproduce clearly  
on the plotted output. Figure 1.9 shows a detail at 3 different scales  
of representation.  
# 4.5 Level of detail and information  
With 3D modelling systems, it is possible to replace an object with  
another showing more detail as the design progresses. To facilitate  
this, the AEC BIM Standards recommend that all components cre-  
ated, or otherwise obtained should be graded, named and stored  
accordingly in the project structure as follows.  
PAS 1192–2 set out requirements for Level of Detail and  
Information \(LOD\), stipulating that all components created, or oth-  
erwise obtained, should be graded, named and stored accordingly  
in the project or central folder structure.  
The graphical appearance is completely independent to the  
metadata included in the object. For example, it is possible to have  
# Design information and dimensional coordination 1-7  
a Grade LOD1 \(symbolic\) object with full manufacturer’s data,  
cost and specification attached. \(AEC BIM Standards, 2015\)  
Component grades of LOD information, **as described in the**  
**AEC \(UK\) BIM Protocol v2.1,** are illustrated in Table VI.  
The grades in the protocol are summarised as\:  
• LOD1 Symbolic – a place-holder representing an object which  
may not be to scale or have any dimensional values. This is par-  
ticularly relevant to electrical symbols which may never exist as  
a 3D object.  
• LOD2 Conceptual – a simple place-holder with absolute mini-  
mum level detail to be identifiable, for example, as any type of  
chair. Has superficial dimensional representation.  
• LOD3 Generic – a generic model, sufficiently modelled to iden-  
tify type and component materials. Typically contains level of  
2D detail suitable for the preferred scale. Dimensions may be  
approximate.  
• Grade LOD4 Specific – a specific object, sufficiently mod-  
elled to identify type and component materials. Has accurate  
**1.9** *A detail shown at low, medium and high scales of representation*  
**Table VI LOD component grades of information \(diagram\: HOK\)** **1-8 Design information and dimensional coordination**  
dimensions. A production, or pre-construction, ‘design intent’  
object representing the end of the design stages. Suitable for pro-  
curement and cost analysis.  
• Grade LOD5 Construction – a detailed, accurate and specific  
object of the construction requirements and building compo-  
nents, including specialist sub-contract geometry and data.  
Should include all necessary sub-components adequately repre-  
sented to enable construction. Used only when a 3D view at a  
sufficient scale deems the detail necessary due to the object’s  
proximity to the camera.  
• Component Grade LOD6 As built – a precisely modelled  
representation of the constructed object. Any construction irreg-  
ularities or eccentricities should be modelled.  
# 5 DIMENSIONAL COORDINATION  
# 5.1 General  
Current building practice involves the assembly of many factory-  
made components\: in some cases, the whole project consists of  
such components slotted together like a child’s construction kit.  
Dimensional Coordination \(DC\) is essential to ensure the suc-  
cess of the system, and consists of a range of dimensions relating  
to the sizing of building components and assemblies, and to the  
buildings incorporating them. DC enables the coordination of the  
many parts that go to make up the total construction which are  
supplied from widely separated sources. At an international level,  
100 mm is accepted as the basic module \(often referred to by the  
letter ‘M’\).  
Dimensional coordination relies on establishment of rectangular  
three-dimensional grids of basic modules into which components  
can be introduced in an interrelated pattern of sizes, Figure 1.10.  
The modular grid network delineates the space into which each  
component fits. The most important factor of dimensional coordi-  
nation is that the component must always be undersized in relation  
to the space grid into which it has to fit \(but not to too great an  
extent\).  
**1.10** *Three-dimensional grid of basic modules*  
In the engineering world, the piston and cylinder principle  
establishes the size relationship between dimensional space grid  
and component, Figure 1.11. The size of the cylinder must allow  
for the right degree of accuracy and tolerance to enable the piston  
to move up and down.  
**1.11** *The piston and cylinder principle*  
The degree of inaccuracy to be allowed for in the building process  
is related to the economics of jointing. Adequate space must be  
allowed for size of component plus joint. Transgressing the rules  
of locating components within the allotted space contained by grid  
lines will cause considerable difficulty in site assembly.  
The basic arrangement of components within the grid layout  
shows them fitting into the spaces allocated to them\: dimensionally  
they are coordinated, thus allowing the designer maximum use of  
standard components, Figure 1.12.  
**1.12** *Fitting a component into a dimensionally*  
*coordinated grid* Advantages to designers may include\:  
• Reduction in design labour  
• Reduced production of working drawings by the use of standard  
details  
• Choice of interrelated standard components at the various price  
levels.  
# 5.2 Aims  
The basic aims of Dimensional Coordination \(DC\) \(as defined in  
BS 4011\:1966\) were to\:  
• Obtain maximum economy in the production of components  
• Reduce the manufacture of non-standard units  
• Avoid wasteful cutting on-site.  
Potential advantages to manufacturers include\:  
• More effective use of labour in producing standard lines  
• Reduction in the stocking, invoicing and other operations con-  
nected with numerous differently sized products. There should  
also be advantages to contractors, not only through better design  
of components for fit but also through increasing familiarity with  
standard components.  
\[Note BS 4011 was superseded by BS 6750\:1986 and both have  
since been replaced by BS ISO 21723\:2019.\]  
# 5.3 Basic elements  
*Preference for size*  
The preferred increments are\:  
• First preference \(multimodule\) multiples of 300 mm  
• Second preference \(basic module\) multiples of 100 mm  
• Third preference \(submodule\) multiples of 50 mm up to 300 mm  
• Fourth preference \(submodule\) multiples of 25 mm up to 300 mm.  
*Reference systems*  
Grid and line\: the DC reference system identifies controlling  
dimensions by the use of a grid on plans and a series of horizontal  
lines on elevations and sections. The terminology is precise\:  
• Controlling dimensions lie between key reference planes \(e.g.  
floor-to-floor height\). They provide a framework within which to  
design and to which components and assemblies may be related.  
• Key reference planes define the boundaries of controlling zones  
or structural axes.  
• Controlling lines on a drawing represent a key reference plane.  
• Axial controlling lines are shown on drawings by a chain dotted  
line with a circle at the end, in which the grid reference is given.  
• Face controlling lines are shown by a continuous line with a cir-  
cle at the end in which the grid reference is given.  
• Zones between vertical or horizontal reference planes provide  
spaces for one or more components which do not necessarily  
fill the space. Provided that use of associated components is not  
inhibited, a building component \(or group of components\) may  
extend beyond the zone boundary, as may trims and finishes.  
# 5.4 Drawings  
The representation of the dimensional coordination framework  
should be consistent on all drawings. On general location drawings,  
a grid representing 300 mm \(or a multiple of 300 mm\) may be used.  
Assembly details may use grids of 300 or 100 mm.  
*Reference lines*  
Reference lines or grids should be thin, to distinguish them from  
other, particularly constructional, lines.  
# Design information and dimensional coordination 1-9  
*Dimension lines*  
Different types of dimensions should be distinguished by the type  
of arrowhead, Figure 1.13.  
**1.13** *Coordinating and work sizes*  
Running dimensions should be set off from a datum, Figure 1.14.  
**1.14** *Running dimensions. The symbol at the datum should be as*  
*shown. An arrowhead is sometimes used, but is not the preferred*  
*alternative*  
*Assembly details*  
Assembly details should show components in their context, that is,  
in relation to the adjoining element, with details of the joint.  
# 5.5 Locating components by grid  
*Types of grid*  
The structural grid of axial controlling lines, Figure 1.15, is estab-  
lished physically by the contractor on-site; it serves as the main  
reference in construction. It is subject to setting out deviations  
which affect the spaces required for assemblies of components; but  
this should have been allowed for in the design stage. A planning  
grid of face controlling lines, Figure 1.16, locates non-structural  
elements.  
• A neutral zone is a zone that does not conform to the recom-  
mended dimensions given in Table VII.  
**1.15** *Axial control*

may use 2350.  
3 Housing may use 250.  
4 Housing may use 2600.  
*Relation between structural and planning grids*  
Structural and planning grids may coincide but do not neces-  
sarily do so. The controlling dimensions for spacing structural  
elements on plan on axial lines are in multiples of 300 mm  
\(Table VII\). If a 300 mm square grid is used then axial con-  
trolling lines will coincide with the grid, Figure 1.17, but if  
the grid is a multiple of 300 mm then the controlling lines will  
be offset from the axial grid by 300 mm or by a multiple of  
300 mm, Figure 1.18.  
**1.17** *Uninterrupted grid*  
**1.18** *Controlling lines offset from grid*  
*Relating zones to a 300 mm grid*  
If widths of structural zones are multiples of 300 mm, the grid is  
continuous, Figure 1.19. If the zone is not a multiple of 300 mm,  
however, the grid is interrupted by the dimension of that zone,  
Figure 1.20. This is referred to as a neutral zone.  
**1.19** *Continuous grid*  
**1.20** *Interrupted grid and neutral zones \(tartan\)*  
*Key reference planes*  
Key reference planes, Figure 1.21, should generally occur at\:  
• Finished floor level  
• Finished suspended ceiling level  
• Finished wall surface.  
Sizes of zones indicated by key reference planes should be  
selected from Table VII. Where controlling or reference lines bound  
floor or roof soffits, deflection should be allowed for in the zone.  
**1.21** *Vertical control\: A being floor-to-ceiling height controlling*  
*dimension; B floor and roof zone; C floor-to-floor and floor-to-*  
*roof controlling dimension*  
# 5.6 Size of components  
*Coordinating and work sizes*  
Controlling dimensions are coordinating sizes\:  
• Coordinating sizes, Figure 1.13, make allowance for fitting and  
jointing. They represent the overlaid grid which does not usually  
coincide with actual junction lines on the face of the building.  
They are indicated by open arrowheads.  
• Work sizes are the specified manufactured sizes \(within permis-  
sible deviations\). They are indicated by closed arrowheads.  
*Tolerance and fit*  
Joint sizes are critical. There are graphical aids \(see Bibliography\)  
to help reconcile all the factors affecting tolerance, such as  
• Expansion and contraction  
• Variability in manufactured size  
• Satisfactory joint clearance range  
• Variations in setting out dimensions, adjacent components and so on  
• Number of components in an assembly  
• Variations in interpretation of work size from a given coordi-  
nating size.  
*Degree of accuracy*  
Designers should identify where fit is critical and where not, or  
they must assess\:  
• Where standard sizes are appropriate and readily available • If some components can be made to order without a significant  
cost penalty  
• Whether cutting is acceptable \(and the effect on performance\)  
• The likely order of assembly.  
# 5.7 Boundary conditions  
Some assembly and support conditions may necessitate variations  
in elements to allow for\:  
• An extended floor slab beyond the clear span to gain a bearing  
on a wall  
• Reduction in size to permit the application of a finish  
• An increased height of positioning to allow for building directly  
off the floor slab or extending through a suspended ceiling to  
reach the soffit of the floor slab.  
These allowances \(termed ‘boundary conditions’\) should be in  
multiples of 25 mm. They may be uneconomic to produce, limiting  
the applications of the product to which they apply.  
# 6 REPROGRAPHICS AND PAPER SIZES  
# 6.1 Paper  
Paper copies of documentation as the means of information trans-  
fer is less common today as a means of exchanging information.  
Clients typically request information to be sent electronically in a  
pdf format. This allows clients and project stakeholders to print out  
at a paper copy in a size that is convenient. But for many purposes,  
paper is still the preferred medium and the international A-series  
of paper sizes is used for all plotted drawings and printed material.  
# 6.2 Sizes in the A-series  
The A range is derived from a rectangle AO of area 1 m2 with sides  
x and y such that x\:y = 1\:√2 \(i.e. x = 841 mm; y = 1189 mm\). The  
other sizes in the series are derived downwards by progressively  
halving the size above across its larger dimension. The proportions  
of the sizes remain constant, Figure 1.22.  
**1.22** *A-sizes retain the same proportion \(1\:√2\), each size being*  
*half the size above folding A1 size*  
# 6.3 Trimmed sizes and tolerances  
The A formats are trimmed sizes and therefore exact; stubs of tear-  
off books, index tabs and so forth are always additional to the A  
dimensions. Printers purchase their paper in sizes allowing for the  
following tolerances of the trimmed sizes\:  
• For dimensions up to and including 150 mm, þ1.5 mm  
• For dimensions greater than 150 mm up to and including  
600 mm, þ2 mm  
• For dimensions greater than 600 mm, þ3 mm. Recommended meth-  
ods of folding the larger A-sized prints are given in Figure 1.23.

**1.23** *A-series of paper sizes*  
# 7 ORDNANCE SURVEY MAPS  
# 7.1 Scales  
Ordnance Survey maps are available to the following scales\:  
1\:50000, 1\:25000, 1\:10000, 1\:2500 and 1\:1250. However, com-  
puter methods of storage and retrieval mean that maps can be  
reproduced to any desired scale. Architects and surveyors inevi-  
tably need to refer back to old maps and plans from time to time.  
These may have been drawn to almost any scale, but the common  
scales to which OS maps were drawn were as follows\: 1 inch to the  
mile \(1\:63360\), 6 inches to the mile \(1\:10560\), 88 feet to the inch  
\(1\:1056\).  
# 7.2 Bench marks and levels  
Points used for measuring and marking levels are known as *bench*  
*marks*. On a particular site a temporary *bench mark* \(TBM\) may  
be established, to which all other levels on that site are referred.  
The level value allocated to the TBM may be to Ordnance Datum;  
more commonly, it is given an arbitrary value. This value should  
be large enough not to require any negative levels \(including lev-  
els of drains, etc.\), as these can lead to errors. All levels in and  
around buildings are recommended to be given to three decimal  
places.  
The heights of Ordnance Survey bench marks are given in  
Bench Mark Lists obtainable from Ordnance Survey \(www.  
ordnancesurvey.co.uk\).  
Modern OS maps to the larger scales include Ordnance Bench  
Marks related to Newlyn, Cornwall Datum. Where known, the  
datum and date of levelling should be stated. OS maps include  
contours. On the 1\:10000 series, the contour interval is 10 m in  
the more mountainous areas and 5 m in the remainder of the  
country.  
# 8 CASE STUDY – USING BIM FOR PROJECT DELIVERY  
Project\: New Papworth Hospital, Papworth, Cambridgeshire.  
Client\: Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust  
Architects\: HOK International Ltd  
Structural Engineer\: Skanska Tech \(Structures\)  
Services Engineer\: TB+A & Fulcro \(MEP\) Consulting Engineers  
Contractor\: Skanska  
Completed\: 2019  
# 8.1 Introduction  
The Royal Papworth Hospital \(RPH\) was a key component of  
the Cambridgeshire Biomedical Campus Expansion plan to cre-  
ate a world-class healthcare campus adjacent to the existing **1-12 Design information and dimensional coordination**  
Addenbrooke’s Hospital. The new RPH enabled the world-class  
cardiothoracic surgery and treatments at the former Papworth  
Hospital to be relocated within a new, state-of-the-art building.  
After winning a design competition in 2011, HOK developed  
the design in its BIM platform Revit between 2012 and 2014.  
Construction began in March 2015 and the Royal Papworth  
Hospital was opened in 2019.  
# 8.2 Facilities  
The purpose-designed RPH provides a reassuring, easy-to-navigate  
environment, achieved through clear spatial organisation to help  
make wayfinding intuitive and reduce stress and anxiety.  
The hospital is designed around two central atria that allow  
natural light to reach all of the patient floors. Upon arrival, the  
reception is centrally placed from which lifts can be accessed serv-  
ing inpatient floors. There is also a link to outpatient facilities with  
day wards, testing and imaging facilities  
The RPH includes\:  
• 310 beds \(virtually all single rooms\)  
• 46-bed critical care area including cardiac recovery unit and car-  
diac high dependency unit  
• 7 state-of-the-art theatres \(including 2 hybrid theatres\)  
• 5 catheter laboratories  
• 6 inpatient wards and a 24-bed day ward  
• A centrally located outpatient unit  
• State-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment facilities.  
# 8.3 Use of BIM  
The initial design competition commenced with 3D massing stud-  
ies at a 1\:500 scale, which developed into critical adjacency plans  
at a 1\:200 scale. The early adoption of BIM allowed site massing  
and building orientation to be quickly established.  
As the design matured, the structural grid was established and  
structural depths of floors, service plenums and interstitial plant  
rooms were designed. In doing so, BIM was used to model the  
entire design from structure, shell and architectural treatment  
through to space planning, services, room design, furniture and  
components \(Figures 1.24, 1.25\).  
A partnership with the University of Reading trialled Virtual  
Reality \(VR\) at their facility known as the Cave. Using the VR  
headsets, clinicians were able to experience what the spaces would  
be like through the BIM model. This allowed the design team to  
**1.24a–c** *BIM model of Royal Papworth Hospital showing a\) structure, b\) shell, and c\) architecture* **Design information and dimensional coordination 1-13**  
in a hospital where many patients are receiving critical care. The  
BIM model was also used to establish whether large pieces of  
equipment such as MRI scanners could be physically removed  
from the hospital at a future date.  
The project achieved Level 2 BIM in collaboration with Skanska  
Tech \(Structures\) TB&A & Fulcro \(MEP\). As a result, the NPH is  
COBie data Level 2 capable and the design team has successfully  
delivered a number of Industry Foundation Classes \(IFC\) models in  
accordance with Skanska’s COBie protocol. The use of IFC mod-  
els allowed Skanska to extract data from the model – this proved  
invaluable for equipment schedules. Collaborative working was  
enhanced with multi-disciplinary workshops. These used the same  
IFC models to identify potential clash detection. Furthermore, the  
cost consultants within the team were able to carry out measure  
quantities required using Solibri software.  
**1.25** *Critical care rooms modelled in BIM*  
benefit from the end users’ feedback. A critical part of the design  
brief was site lines from nursing stations to critical care beds. By  
using the BIM model, HOK was able to demonstrate that this key  
criterion could be met.  
BIM was also used to help demonstrate that statutory travel dis-  
tances for means of escape were verified. This is vitally important  
# 8.4 Outcome  
The scheduling tools within the BIM platforms were invaluable  
for Skanska to quickly quantify components required and medical  
equipment required.  
HOK created and coded to NHS standard, 2000 3D Revit fam-  
ilies, Figure 1.26. These were loaded into 2300 rooms, varying  
from complex hybrid theatres to plant rooms. The final, fully  
loaded equipment Revit model consisted of 8500 pieces of equip-  
ment. All the rooms and equipment were linked to the BIM model  
**1.26** *Families of equipment, modelled in Revit* **1-14 Design information and dimensional coordination**  
via a database software called dRofus. This is used extensively to  
validate the Schedule of Areas \(SOA\) provided against the NHS  
trust’s SOA. It was also used to prepare and validate schedules of  
equipment in every room, as well as track any changes that were  
required.  
The construction delivery partner Skanska had access to the  
HOK’s database dRofus and they were able to ensure each room  
got the correct equipment whether this was the number of power  
or data socket, baby change units, desks or wipe boards. This has  
meant that Skanska have been able to procure specialist and gen-  
eral equipment with near 100 per cent certainty. This has saved  
considerable time on the programme and allowed for a mature  
Asset Information Model. All of this has given the hospital trust  
greater cost certainty and has helped with the 6D planning for life  
after the construction phase.  
The database and its connection to the BIM model allows for the  
user to know where every piece of equipment is in the building –  
for example that there are more than 7800 twin socket outlets in  
the hospital.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Universal design  
As a general aim, this chapter should be viewed primarily as a  
starting point in the design process, as a guide to the principles and  
conventions that govern how particular building types are planned  
to suit their eventual occupants. A primary and guiding princi-  
ple adopted throughout is the concept of universal \(or inclusive\)  
design.  
Universal Design refers to the design and composition of an  
environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used  
to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their  
age, size, ability or disability.  
Disability Discrimination Act, 2005  
The benefits of adopting this position include the production of  
designs that aim to exclude no one from enjoying the end results.  
This also has the potential to future proof the building for adap-  
tation later. However, this inclusive approach can have some  
considerable associated problems. For instance, the section on  
*Anthropometrics* will illustrate that simply identifying the broad  
range of physical size for users can be problematic, as is the design  
of appropriate *ergonomic* living environments when bespoke solu-  
tions are not always possible but may also exclude many other  
users. Universal design is therefore often a compromised solution  
but the guiding principle ensures that it is the best possible fit under  
any particular circumstances.  
# 1.2 Specialist guides  
In recent years, specialist and readily accessible design guides  
have been produced by bodies such as the RIBA or the Centre for  
Excellence in Universal Design, Dublin. As these guides interpret  
and clarify legislative requirements in a highly comprehensible  
manner, reference is made to each of these guides by pointing to  
them as sources of further detailed information and particularly  
how that information is developed.  
This chapter is therefore an introduction to the principles of  
anthropometrics and ergonomics, the setting up of basic sanitary  
and domestic spaces standards, but premised on the notion that this  
information is the preface to further research and design review.

# 2 ANTHROPOMETRICS  
# 2.1 Size and variation  
The human form comes in many different shapes and sizes and  
designing to accommodate people in whatever capacity requires  
a working knowledge of the interaction between designed objects  
or spaces and the ultimate users. Much of this knowledge can be  
intuitive because we all have experience of our own. However,  
this knowledge can also be limiting as it is not just about propor-  
tion, scale or ease of movement; there are health and safety issues  
involved as well as designing for inclusion and equality in access.  
Anthropometrics is concerned with the size and variations of the  
human body and when combined with ergonomics, the allied study  
of the interaction of humans and the designed world, we have 2  
entire scientific disciplines devoted to the subject. This section  
aims to introduce only the basic concepts involved and will point  
to reference sources for further information.  
# 2.2 Primary data  
Much of the primary anthropometrical data comes from a collection  
of various different studies conducted over the last 20 years and can  
be surprisingly inaccurate when used in isolation. Understanding  
the value of anthropometric data therefore also needs an under-  
standing of the basic statistical tools that allow us to make good use  
of the data. Firstly, we have to recognise that there is no standard  
human shape type; average height people can be thin, fat, young  
or old. Average heights can vary between ages, sexes and differ-  
ent ethnic and national backgrounds. For example, the Dutch are  
Europe’s tallest people and a study of Polish industrial workers  
suggests that they are Europe’s shortest.  
The primary data collected on individual population proportions  
is usually presented as a frequency distribution curve, Figure 2.1.  
Also known as a bell curve because of its shape, it represents a  
cross section of the distribution of data for any particular dimen-  
sion across a particular population. So using height for an example,  
the curve will indicate that at one end the number of short people  
**2.1** *Normal distribution ‘bell’ curve. The y-axis plots the numbers*  
*of men \(in this example\) in a group who are the height given on*  
*the x-axis \(within certain limits\). In a normal distribution the*  
*average, the mean and the median are all equal*  
**2-1** **2-2 People and space**  
starts from roughly zero and builds to the peak where the largest  
numbers are, representing the average \(or mean\) in most cases  
and then decreasing as the number of taller people also diminishes  
towards the highest end in a symmetrical pattern.  
# 2.3 Percentiles  
This bell curve allows us to derive some very useful information  
commonly referred to as the percentiles. Statistically, we can use this  
symmetrical curve to illustrate that if we split the curve at the mid-  
point we will have 50 per cent of the population measured falling  
on one side of the divide and 50 per cent on the other. This midway  
point is called the 50th percentile or abbreviated to 50th percentile.  
At either end, we can also split the curve, removing the lowest and  
the highest 5 per cent. By doing this we end up with a range of sizes  
that excludes the top and bottom 5 per cent, giving us the range that  
will accommodate 90 per cent of a particular population. These ends  
are known as the 5th percentile and the 95th percentile respectively.  
This is very useful information when designing something for  
large populations where accommodating the top or bottom 5 per cent  
can prove unnecessarily difficult or expensive. The size of seats on a  
train, for instance, allows more passengers to be carried if seat sizes  
are limited to the 95th percentile. However, using the 95th percentile  
would be wholly inappropriate if designing a fire escape that would  
prevent 5 per cent of the population from getting out. Where the pop-  
ulation size is fairly consistently variable such as in the UK, the 5th  
percentile and 95th percentiles will accommodate 90 per cent of the  
population and are used for most design solutions where safety is not  
an issue. In other countries, the USA in particular, where there are dis-  
crete pockets in the population that may have a larger number within  
the outer 5 per cent ranges, the 1st percentile and 99th percentiles are  
more commonly used incorporating 98 per cent of the population.  
# 2.4 Standard deviation  
In order to move between percentiles we have to manipulate the data  
concerned provided we have 2 basic pieces of information. The mean  
in most cases is represented by the peak of the curve, but we have not  
yet considered the width of the ‘bell’. Essentially the wider the base of  
the curve, the more variable are the values and this spread is called the  
standard deviation \(SD\). For example, the bell curve for the height of  
all women in a population compared to the population of women high  
jumpers would be expected to be flatter as the average height would  
be lower and the spread wider as the number of female high jumpers  
is likely to be constrained to a smaller group of tall women. The mean  
and the SD allow us to calculate the other percentiles using the formula\:  
*X*p = *m* + *zSD*  
where\: *X*p is the value you are looking for  
*p* represents the percentile in question  
SD is the standard deviation  
*z* is a constant for selected percentiles found in Table I  
*m* is the mean value or 50th percentile.  
So, calculating the 99th percentile for British adult women with  
an average height of 1620 mm and a SD of 61 \(found in Table II\),  
we see that for *p* = 99, *z* = 2.33\. Therefore the 99th percentile for  
women’s height is\: 1620 + 2.33 × 61 = 1762 mm.  
To include women high jumpers, we may need to go to the  
99.999th percentile where *z* = 4.26 so the 99th percentile for wom-  
en’s height is\: 1620 + 4.26 × 61 = 1880 mm.  
# 2.5 Extracting information from the tables  
Anthropometric data comes in a standard form for any particular  
population, normally based on two postures, standing and sitting,  
with 36 measurements in total. There is a standard format for tak-  
ing these measurements as well such as standing against an upright  
surface and keeping the parts of the ear in line with parts of the eye  
to keep the head in a standardised position. This defined position-  
ing needs to be accounted for when using the data to design for  
different postures, a reclining chair for instance.

# 2.6 Standing and sitting dimensions  
The particular dimensions are numbered to correspond to the  
information in the anthropometric tables. The number of dif-  
ferent anthropometric tables provided here has been limited  
to British adults up to 65 years old \(Table II\), British adults  
over 65 \(Table III\) and 2 for British children aged 11 years to  
accommodate those in primary education \(Table IV\) and those  
aged 18 years to accommodate those in secondary education  
\(Table V\). Those over 65 tend to shrink slightly with age and,  
more significantly, the body tends to be less flexible in adapting  
to dimensionally unfavourable situations.  
It is important to recognise that these data refer to naked sizes  
so extra needs to be added to account for clothing. Clothing and  
particularly shoe heights can vary according to the situation but as  
a general rule it is accepted that for most situations it is appropri-  
ate to add a specific, although different, amount to all dimensions  
for men and women. Specific situations will have to be calculated  
individually such as areas where tool belts may be worn, extra thick  
clothing may be required or fashion may dictate extra high heels  
for periods.  
• Add 25 mm to all dimensions for men.  
• Add 45 mm to all dimensions for women.  
Clearance is the extra space needed to accommodate people  
comfortably or safely. Where health and safety concerns dictate  
clearances, advice should be sought elsewhere. However, there are  
some general rules that can be applied for personal space require-  
ments. These space standards assume face-to-face interaction with  
other people and place a radius around individuals depending on  
the following social interactions\:  
• Intimate up to 450 mm  
• Personal 450 to 1200 mm  
• Social 1200 to 3600 mm  
• Public over 3600 mm.  
These standards are often broken, however, as air travel or the  
London Underground at rush hour will clearly demonstrate. It is  
also worth noting that intruding into this personal space is more  
acceptable if it is not on the facing side. **People and space 2-3**

# 3 ERGONOMICS  
# 3.1 Introduction  
Ergonomics is strictly the science of work including the people,  
the methods and the tools they use, but it also includes the places  
they work in and significantly also the psychological aspects of that  
environment \(Pheasant & Haslegrave, 2006\). For the purposes of  
ergonomic design, however, we can limit ourselves to the collec-  
tion of data that with appropriate referencing permit satisfactory,  
although conventional, design solutions focused on the user. The  
term conventional design is used here to differentiate it from the  
equally important \(if not more so\) universal design referred to in  
the introduction.  
True ergonomic design aims to *fit the job to the worker and the*  
*product to the user*, including equal reference to criteria such as effi-  
ciency, ease of use, comfort, health and safety and quality of working  
life \(Pheasant & Haslegrave, 2006\). Here we limit ourselves to some  
practical data for use in conventional domestic and non-domestic  
building design. This data is broken down into two main areas\:  
• Personal working spaces – heights and reach when sitting or  
standing  
• Maintenance and access – openings and space requirements.  
# 3.2 Personal working spaces  
*Sitting at work*  
Given the variation in human dimensions, it follows that the  
spaces humans require will also vary and can be planned for by  
using the statistical tools provided. In addition, however, there are  
also strict regulatory requirements governing the design and man-  
ufacture of most work related furniture. The design of an office  
desk for example could be subject to requirements coming under  
the jurisdiction of\:  
• International Standards \(ISO\)  
• European Standards \(EN\)  
• British Standards \(BS\)  
• British Health & Safety \(HSE\).  
The sizes required for computer workstations are therefore  
tightly controlled as well as following ergonomic principles. Figure  
2.3 illustrates the sizes required for desks to accommodate comput-  
ers and associated chairs. These dimensions are simplified, however,  
as the actual requirements are understandably complicated. For  
instance, the height of a desk should be suitable for everyone who  
may need to use it. A height of 740 mm can accommodate 95 per  
cent of the population whereas a height adjustable desk \(from  
660 mm to 900 mm\) can accommodate almost everyone.  
*Standing at work and home*  
Common practice for work surface heights suggests\:  
• For delicate tasks – from 50–100 mm above elbow height  
• For manipulative tasks needing some force – from 50–100 mm  
below elbow  
• For heavy work – from 100–300 mm below elbow height.  
With the great variety of human sizes and the variety of tasks  
usually associated with work surfaces, standardised work surface  
heights are by definition compromised solutions. However, spe-  
cialist tasks can be accommodated and surface heights designed  
around those tasks.  
*Kitchen heights*  
Domestic kitchen worktops are included here as functional working  
areas because they illustrate both the basic design requirements and  
the compromises necessary to accommodate standard population  
variations. Although Figure 2.4 illustrates the normal heights for  
kitchen units, the story behind these figures makes useful reading.  
As with the common practice heights above, research sug-  
gests that there are also three ‘working heights’ for kitchen design  
\(Pheasant & Haslegrave, 2006\). But the weighted conclusions  
pointed to the ideal height as being 100 mm below elbow height.  
For the 50 percentile for British adults this provides a figure of  
905 mm for women and 990 mm for men. However, the range from  
the 5 percentile women to the 95 percentile men goes from 830 to  
1005 mm. The dimensions recommended here assume that the data  
will be used to design for a wide range of the British population  
but aimed specifically to accommodate 95 per cent of the elderly  
whose strength, reach etc., is most likely to be limited. For more  
specific populations where heights can be individualised as in spe-  
cific workplaces, please refer to specialist literature, for example,  
British Health & Safety \(HSE\).  
**2.3** *Sitting worktop – useful working dimensions for desk space or*  
*computer workstations but more detailed information should be*  
*sought for specialist or specific tasks*  
*Accessing storage at work and home*  
The ideal layout of storage space and its accessibility bears a strong  
relationship to the weights involved, the frequency of use and the  
range of people involved. Here again we turn to the domestic  
kitchen to detail recommendations for storage zones. The heavi-  
est and certainly the most dangerous items to be used and stored  
are dishes and pots lifted into and out of ovens. Research \(Noble,  
1982\) suggests that 300 mm deep and 1400 mm high \(reduced to  
1350 mm when reaching over an obstruction\) shelves can be used  
by 95 per cent of the elderly population. As this group are more  
likely to have difficulty in kneeling and bending, deep shelves  
should be kept above 500 mm. It is worth noting here that the opti-  
mal storage height is also the most advantageous worktop height,  
resulting in maximum demand for space in this zone.  
# 3.3 Maintenance, access and openings  
Buildings need constant maintenance, whether it is the services that  
are located within the building or the building fabric itself. These  
are not publically accessible spaces and, as there is a requirement  
to provide a safe working environment, also fall within relevant  
Health & Safety legislation \(the list is extensive but can be accessed  
at www.hse.gov.uk\). As the access required is also very task spe-  
cific, it is well beyond the scope of this work to go into any detail,  
particularly as it could legitimately be restricted to certain people,  
that is, those who are sufficiently able and agile. Some general and  
basic dimensions are provided in Figures 2.5 to 2.10.  
# 4 SANITARY PROVISION  
# 4.1 Inclusivity  
The space requirements for sanitary facilities should be designed  
to accommodate the needs of all a building’s users as those users  
could include adults and children of all ages, sizes and abilities. Be  
they independent, accompanied or assisted, it is assumed that a uni-  
versal \(or inclusive\) design approach will be adopted to ensure that the facilities can be accessed and used by that diverse population.  
See also Chapter 4, Inclusive and accessible design.  
The extent of the provision in a particular building will depend  
on its type and size, the occupancy, patterns of use and gender ratio.  
It is recognised that females take longer to use toilet facilities than  
males so the gender ratio should be taken into account, recognising  
that the ratio may change over time. To illustrate this the British  
Toilet Association recommends that the required number of female  
cubicles should equal *twice* the number of male cubicles and uri-  
nals added together.  
**2.4** *Sitting worktop – useful working dimensions for kitchens or*  
*similar spaces but more detailed information should be sought for*  
*specialist or specific tasks*  
The added value of an inclusive design approach that addresses the  
needs of one group can have benefits for many others as well. Level  
access facilities designed for wheelchair users are also helpful for  
people with sticks, crutches, frames, pushchairs, luggage or other  
mobility aids, larger compartments likewise and clear signage can  
help those with reading difficulties or whose first language is not  
English, as well as the poorly sighted. Wheelchair-accessible com-  
partments can also be preferable for those using assistance dogs,  
those with dwarfism, parents with small children, those accompa-  
nied by carers, anyone with luggage and many more.  
It is estimated that about 20 per cent of the adult population in  
the UK \(around 11.7 million people\) are covered by the disabil-  
ity legislation, there are around 5000 working assistance dogs and  
around half a million people use a wheelchair all or part of the time.  
In addition, there are 3.3 million families with children under the  
age of five \(*Housing Design Standards, Evidence Summary*, 2010\).  
# 4.2 Design aspects  
*Provision of sanitary facilities*  
In the provision of sanitary facilities, compromise is always prob-  
ably necessary because of the large gap between what is desirable  
and what is possible. Therefore, minimum requirements provide  
the starting point for particular building types and circumstances.  
Good design practice would use these as minima but with the aim  
of inclusive design solutions always uppermost. The overall scale  
of the provision will depend on\:  
• The size and particular nature of the building as well as the peo-  
ple being catered for. This is an aspect that should be considered  
very early in the design process and should involve consultation  
with a wide range of interested parties from users to regulatory  
authorities. For particular building types, suggested gender ratios  
are given in Table VI.

• Access routes and convenience in relation to other key facilities  
within a building. Routes to toilets should be as short as possible.  
In large public buildings, the horizontal travel distance to the  
nearest toilet facilities should not exceed 40 m. In schools, this  
is reduced to 25 m. In addition, a clearly identified, fully acces-  
sible unisex toilet should be provided on each floor of a building  
with a lift. If no lift is available, accessible toilet facilities should  
be provided at the entrance level. The sanitary requirements for  
schools are given in Table VII.

COMPARTMENTS AND CUBICLES  
To provide the requisite numbers of sanitary facilities within  
a defined space envelope there is still the need to provide  
some that do not meet the accessibility standards. WC *com-*  
*partments* \(fully enclosed\) and WC *cubicles* \(partitions only\)  
need to ensure privacy. The doors are traditionally a problem  
area, as inward-opening doors require more space and out-  
ward-opening doors compromise the safety of others outside  
of the cubicle. The space requirements and possible layouts  
for single WC layouts with both opening styles are illustrated  
in Figures 2.18 to 2.22.  
Hand washing facilities are also a requirement and can be pro-  
vided within each compartment/cubicle, although efficient space  
use would normally place them in an adjoining space if possible.  
The space requirements and possible layouts for single WC lay-  
outs with washbasins and both opening door styles are illustrated  
in Figures 2.23 to 2.29.

COMMUNAL SANITARY SPACES  
The communal provision of hand washing facilities is the more  
common and space efficient solution and the space requirements  
for both individual basins and larger groups are illustrated in  
Figures 2.30 to 2.33. Fixing heights vary from 700 mm as ideal for  
smaller children, 760 mm in hospitals and 785 mm to 800 mm for  
most other situations.

# 5 DOMESTIC SPACE STANDARDS  
There is evidence that space standards are related to health and  
well-being and although not part of UK national planning frame-  
works, space standards do currently exist in some district and local  
planning guidance. These include the Lifetime Homes standard that  
aims to ensure that new dwellings can adapt to the needs of their  
occupants, particularly as they change in later life and the Mayor  
of London’s *Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance* \(2016\).  
**2.34** *Range of urinals, activity and circulation spaces*  
Individual urinals \(for male use only\) are also commonly provided  
as groups, ranged along rows in a communal fashion. Normally  
fixed with the leading edge 610 m above floor level with one at  
510 mm for small boys. The space requirements are illustrated in  
Figure 2.34.  
Hand drying facilities are generally expected to be provided  
in close association with the washbasins \(up to 2 washbasins per  
dryer\) and if electrically powered to also have a towel type backup.  
Heights of 800 mm to 1200 mm are recommended to cover a wider  
range of people. Positioning within the communal space should  
avoid doors and obstructions while also taking into account traffic  
flows, aiming to be positioned en route from the washbasins to  
the exit.

# 2.2 Ramps and gradients  
A ramp is essentially a sloping pathway, used where a difference  
in levels exists between the site access point and the main building  
entrance. There are some clear design requirements \(Figure 3.1\).  
First among these is the concept that a slope is not a comforta-  
ble place to be for many people, particularly those with impaired  
mobility because of gravity pulling them down the slope. Level  
approaches and landings are therefore essential to allow people  
to stop and take breath if necessary. The length of slope between  
landings and the steepness \(gradient\) are also crucial. In addition,  
any design solution should recognise that some ambulant disa-  
bled people find ramps particularly difficult and prefer a stepped  
access.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
The aim here is to ensure that the design process is founded on  
the principle that all people – regardless of age, gender or ability  
– should be able to gain access to buildings and once inside, they  
should be able to use the building whether it is a home, a place  
of work or even if just visiting. This means that people moving  
about that building – its very lifeblood – should be carefully con-  
sidered in the earliest stages of the design process. It therefore  
recognises that the overall strategy may need to include plans  
for access to the building and also horizontal circulation as well  
as vertical movement between storeys, whether mechanical or  
human-powered.  
This chapter provides some basic design information. But it must  
not be used to bypass the fundamental principle that a design team  
should include expert input on the very complicated matter of circula-  
tion and the physical constraints, psychological aspects and long-term  
sustainability of the building. To illustrate this point, lift shafts in par-  
ticular \(a significant structural element\) can be designed and arranged  
to serve the required population needs as part of an overall circulation  
strategy in the very early stages of the design process.

# 2 ACCESS TO BUILDINGS  
# 2.1 Background  
All people should be able to reach the main entrance of the build-  
ing from the site boundary or designated car parking provision in  
a way that is suitable and safe. Essential aspects of the design pro-  
cess therefore are the slope involved, the width of access and the  
materials used in construction. In particular, access routes should  
be designed so that people can travel along them safely ‘with-  
out excessive effort and without the risk of tripping or falling’  
\(according to Part M of the Building Regulations\). They should  
also be wide enough to accommodate people moving in different  
directions.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-4  
Slope gradients are normally defined in terms of their height to distance  
ratio. A 1\:20 slope is therefore one where for every 1 metre achieved  
vertically, 20 metres has also been travelled horizontally. This ratio  
can also be expressed as a percentage where a 1\:20 slope equals a 5 per  
cent change in height for any particular distance travelled. It can also  
be viewed as an angle of slope where 1\:20 equals 2.86.  
For reference, a 1\:1 slope \(100 per cent\), equal to 45°, illustrates  
that expressions of slope can be counterintuitive.  
In designing ramps, it is usual to use the terms ‘going’ for the  
horizontal distance travelled and ‘rise’ for the vertical distance  
\(terms also used in staircase design\). Because of the potential dif-  
ficulties outlined above, ramp gradients and lengths are strictly  
controlled. Part M of the Building Regulations states that no ramp  
should have ‘a going more than 10 m or a rise more than 500 mm’  
between level landings. This equates to a 1\:20 gradient, although  
slightly steeper slopes are allowed if the distance travelled is less;  
for a maximum going of 5 m, a gradient of 1\:15 is allowed and at  
2 m going, it rises to 1\:12. Figure 3.2 illustrates the relationship of  
ramp going and rise and can be used to interpolate for dimensions  
between the 3 examples.  
# 2.3 Ramp design  
• **Width\:** Ramps should be a minimum of 1.8 m wide to allow  
people and wheelchairs to pass freely. This can be reduced to  
1.5 m provided passing spaces \(1.8 m\) are provided \(reduced to  
0.9 m for domestic situations\).  
• **Landings\:** Ramps should have level landings. These are defined  
as 1\:60 maximum slope along their length and 1\:40 slope cross-  
fall to allow water drainage. They should be at least 1.2 m long  
**3-1** **3-2 People and movement**  
at the foot and head of the ramp with intermediate landings  
of 1.5 m. Where it is not possible to see the full length of the  
ramp, 1.8 m square passing space landings should be provided  
\(reduced to 1.2 m for domestic situations\).  
• **Handrails\:** Handrails should be provided on both sides of a  
ramp \(see Section 4.3\).  
• **Kerbs\:** A 100 mm minimum high kerb should be provided on  
any open side of a ramp and be clearly visible.  
• **Surfaces\:** All surfaces should be slip resistant especially when  
wet, and landings should be clearly noticeable and visually con-  
trasting.  
# 2.4 Stairs  
The design of a staircase or a stepped access involves the combina-  
tion of gradient and the idea of a standard footfall – the step itself.  
For more complex staircase design, the three-dimensional aspect  
becomes important where the flight of stairs has to repeat itself  
above the original, following on from one storey to another so that  
maintaining sufficient headroom is a primary concern.  
# 2.5 Step design  
One major advantage of steps over ramps is that while ramps offer  
a sloping surface that can be difficult for many, steps essentially  
offer a level landing at each step. It is worth noting that a single step  
rise is not recommended under most circumstances.  
As with ramp design, steps have a going and a rise, but, in this  
case, it exists for each individual step as well as the overall flight.  
Traditionally, where space was short, steps were designed with a  
‘nosing’ \(Figure 3.3\) which for any particular going, allowed a  
larger space for the footfall. The going is measured from the nos-  
ing to nosing but the footfall is in effect the going plus the nosing.  
For many ambulant disabled or poor sighted people the nosing can  
present a real hazard as it can catch the toe of the foot when going  
forward. Poorly sighted people may understandably wish to push  
their foot to the back of each step to ensure that they are totally  
secure.

*Diagram 4\)*  
# 2.6 External stepped access design  
• **Width\:** Access stairs should be no less than 1.2 m wide \(reduced  
to 0.9 m for domestic situations\).  
• **Treads**\: Treads should be consistent throughout the flight with  
a rise of between 150 mm and 170 mm and with a going of  
between 280 mm and 450 mm \(reduced to between 75 mm and  
150 mm rise with a minimum going of 280 mm in domestic sit-  
uations\). There should be no open risers.  
• **Landings\:** Access stairs should have landings provided not less  
than 1.2 m wide, for every 12 risers for a going of less than 350  
mm or 18 risers if the going is more than 350 mm \(total of 1.8 m  
rise in domestic situations\). There should be at least a 1.2 m level  
approach at the foot and head of the stair with intermediate land-  
ings also of 1.2 m \(reduced to 0.9 m for domestic situations\).  
• **Handrails\:** Handrails should be provided on both sides \(see  
Figure 3.4\). In the case of stair access that is wider than the min-  
imum, additional handrails are required along the centre line to  
ensure that the effective width of access is not less than 1.0 m, or  
more than 1.8 m wide.  
• **Surfaces\:** External stepped access routes need to have warning  
surfaces provided. These are commonly termed a corduroy haz-  
ard warning strip and provide a clearly identifiable change in  
surface condition that warns of an approaching change in level.  
A 55 mm wide visually contrasting material is also required on  
both the tread and riser of each step.  
# 2.7 Access doors  
Unless designing main \(or alternative access\) entrance doors it is  
important to consider all potential users. Wheelchair users will  
have certain requirements, as will the poorly sighted or those with  
limited strength. For example, a manually operated self-closing  
door set with sufficient power to close against normal wind speeds  
will probably be beyond the strength capacity of most wheelchair  
users or those with limited strength.  
Specifically, this limit is exceeded when ‘the opening force  
at leading edge of the door is not more than 30N at the leading  
edge from 0° \(the door in the closed position\) to 30° open, and  
not more than 22.5N at the leading edge from 30° to 60° of the  
opening cycle’ \(from Building Regulations Part M 2.17 paragraph  
a\). Revolving doors are not considered accessible because of the  
difficulties they create for a whole host of potential users.  
*Preferences*  
• Glazed doors allow people to see potential obstacles and others  
approaching, but must also be made visually noticeable for the  
poorly sighted.  
• Powered sliding doors do not waste the space associated with the  
arc of a door swing, and automatic opening sliding doors do not  
require access to a manual opening device.  
• An opening and closing system operated by remote sensors  
requires no contact with the door.  
# 2.8 Door width  
To take account of different door styles and support systems, the  
‘effective clear width’ is referred to as it states the total width of  
opening available that is devoid of any obstructions caused by  
such items as door handles, hinges or limited turning capacity.  
Unpowered access doors should also have a minimum of 300 mm  
extra unobstructed space alongside the operating latch to allow for  
wheelchair approach.  
Figure 3.5 provides the minimum effective door widths as  
defined by Part M of the Building Regulations. **3-4 People and movement**

# 3 HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT WITHIN  
# BUILDINGS  
# 3.1 Entrance lobbies  
Providing a lobby space at the entrance to a building makes sense  
in many ways. Environmentally, it can limit uncontrolled air move-  
ment, reducing heat loss and draughts. It can also provide a space  
to shed rainwater to avoid the associated slip hazard further in the  
building, and it can also provide transitional lighting levels.  
# 3.2 Entrance lobby design  
• **Size\:** The lobby should be large enough to allow a wheelchair user  
\(accompanied\) or a parent with a pushchair to negotiate the doors  
at either end, clear of the opening arc of the other door, see Figure  
3.6\. For a lobby length, this means adding 1570 mm to the space  
created by the arcs. For width, it is the effective clear door width  
plus 300 mm to allow wheelchair access to the operating system.  
• **Surfaces\:** Floor surfaces to lobbies should be level without  
changes in surface that may constitute a trip hazard. They should  
also assist in the removal of rainwater but without impeding  
the movement of pushchairs and wheelchairs. Coir matting, for  
example, is not suitable.  
# 3.3 Corridors  
The provision of corridors within buildings will aim to satisfy many  
different requirements. To satisfy inclusive design principles, min-  
imum sizes and surface material conditions should be expected  
for general horizontal movement around a building. For other,  
non-standard access, a more ergonomic approach can be employed.  
# 3.4 Inclusive corridor design  
• **Width\:** The corridor should be large enough to allow wheel-  
chair users \(accompanied\) or a parent with a pushchair to move  
freely. Localised narrowing is acceptable provided the basic  
principle is not compromised. A minimum unobstructed width  
of 1200 mm is required with 1800 mm square passing places  
at intervals.  
• **Surfaces\:** Floor surfaces to corridors should be level \(see Figure  
3.2\) with a non-slip surface without patterns that may be mis-  
taken for stairs. There should be sufficient contrast between the  
floor, wall and ceiling to assist people with visual impairment,  
together with good lighting levels.  
For non-standard corridor widths Figure 3.7a–e gives some indica-  
tion of what can be used.

# 3.5 Corridor widths  
Corridor handling capacity \(Cc\) in people per minute can be calcu-  
lated using\:  
Cc = 60 *v D W*  
where\: *v* is the average pedestrian speed \(m/s\)  
*D* is the average pedestrian density \(people per m2\)  
*W* is the corridor width \(m\)  
**Free flow design\: D** = **0.3 people per m2 and v** = **1.0 to 1.3 m/s**  
**Full flow design\: D** = **1.4 people per m2 and v** = **0.6 to 0.8 m/s**  
*Note\: People tend to wander about in corridors*  
# 4 VERTICAL MOVEMENT WITHIN BUILDINGS  
# 4.1 Internal stairs  
Internal stairs come in 3 basic forms\:  
• Private stairs as would be found in domestic situations  
• Utility stairs that cover escape and maintenance requirements  
• General access stairs that cover most of the remaining circum-  
stances.  
A fourth version includes certain assembly buildings such as  
sports stadia, theatres or cinemas where the access stairs form part  
of the slant of the floor where seating is designed to maximise  
sight-lines for spectators. In these cases, the stairs need to follow  
those inclines so the resulting designs are very project specific.  
However, there are specific Building Regulations covering these  
instances and reference should be made to Part K1, Section 1.4 for  
further information and guidance.  
# 4.2 Stair pitch  
In the case of private stairs, the maximum pitch is 42°. The pitch  
or angle of the stair is not designated as a gradient as in the case of  
ramps, but as an angle derived from an arithmetic computation of  
the rise and going.  
From basic trigonometry\:  
*Tangent Function*\: *tan \(θ*\) = *Opposite /Adjacent*  
where *θ* is the angle we require, *opposite* is the rise and *adjacent*,  
the going, we can derive\:  
*Stair pitch \(θ\)* = *tan−1* *\(rise/going\)*  
Or, using a specific example, where the rise is 170 mm and the  
going is 250 mm\:  
*tan−1* *\(170/250\)* = *34.2*°  
A simpler rule of thumb for normal stairs \(based on the approxi-  
mate adult stride on a stair\) suggests that the going plus twice the  
rise should fall between 550 mm and 700 mm\:  
Going + \(2 × rise\) = 550 mm to 700 mm  
Or, using the same example where the rise is 170 mm and the going  
is 250 mm\:  
250 + \(2 × 170\) = 590 mm  
For the maximum and minimum rise and goings, refer to Table I  
but it is also worth noting that for schools, the recommended rise is  
150 mm with a going of 280 mm.

**3.8** *Alternating stair tread layout \(Source\: Building Regulation K1 1.10\)*  
Under certain limited domestic circumstances, an alternating stair  
can be used \(Figure 3.8\). In order to save space and increase the  
pitch to well over the standard 42°, these stairs maintain the mini-  
mum going of 220 mm and the maximum rise of 220 mm but only  
for each individual footfall. These stairs require people to walk  
up taking each step alternatively, so someone who may have to  
negotiate one step at a time for both feet would have to zigzag up  
the stair. Equally, turning around halfway up can be problematic,  
requiring both feet on one step to avoid encountering a double rise  
going down.  
# 4.3 Internal stair design  
• **Width\:** Stairs should not be less than 1.2 m wide. \(There is no  
minimum in domestic situations but 850 mm is suggested with  
600 mm when the stair is serving only one room.\)  
• **Treads\:** Treads should be consistent throughout the flight with  
a rise and going as shown in Table I. There should be no open  
risers \(except in domestic situations where they are constructed  
with a minimum 16 mm overhang and a 100 mm diameter sphere  
cannot pass through the risers\). For tapered treads, the standard  
design principles should still be adhered to but with the going  
measured at the middle of the stair, subject to a minimum 50 mm  
tread at the narrow end \(Figure 3.9\).  
• **Landings\:** Stairs should have landings provided not less than  
1.2 m long, for every 16 risers in the case of a utility stair and  
for every 12 risers for general access stairs \(Figure 3.10\). There  
should be at least a 1.2 m level approach at the foot and head of  
the stair with intermediate landings also of 1.2 m \(reduced to  
the stair width with 400 mm unobstructed by door openings for  
domestic situations\).  
• **Handrails\:** Handrails should be provided on both sides \(see  
Figure 3.3\). In the case of general access stairs that are wider  
than the minimum, additional handrails are required to ensure  
that the effective width of access is not less than 1.0 m or more  
than 2.0 m wide.  
• **Headroom\:** A minimum of 2000 mm clear headroom should  
be provided at all landings and access points as well as above  
the pitch line, measured at the outer limit of each going  
\(Figure 3.11\).

# 4.5 Handrails  
The design of handrails needs to take account of the principle that  
all people, regardless of age, gender or ability should be able to use  
them. They could in certain circumstances provide a physical aid to  
assist ambulant disabled in hauling themselves upward and there-  
fore be subject to significant loading. They should also provide a  
distinctive visual contrast to assist in location.  
In most circumstances, handrails should be fixed between 900  
mm and 1100 mm above the floor or pitch line \(see Figure 3.12\)  
and subject to the design requirements set out in Figure 3.13.

culated using\:

*D* is the average pedestrian density \(people per m2\)

**Free flow design\: D** = **0.6 people per m2 and v** = **0.6 to 0.8 m/s**  
**Full flow design\: D** = **2.0 people per m2 and v** = **0.6 to 0.8 m/s**  
Note\: People tend to walk in an orderly fashion on stairs.

*grip and structural integrity \(Source\: Building Regulation Part*  
*K1 1.13\)*  
# 4.6 Guarding  
Handrails and stair guarding serve distinctly different purposes  
although they can also be combined into one element. Where hand-  
rails, usually wall mounted, are used to assist in negotiating stairs  
as a handhold, stair guarding is there to prevent people falling over  
an exposed edge of the stair; banisters serve both purposes.  
In the case of staircase design, guarding should be provided  
to the same height requirements as the associated handrails when  
there is a drop of more than 600 mm.  
Building Regulation Part K1 requires that in buildings that will  
be used by children under five, additional conditions come into  
force. Inclusive design principles suggest that this should include  
all buildings where children under five may visit, thereby including  
almost all buildings.  
**3.12** *Handrail positioning – essential elements are the dimensions and structural integrity \(Source\: Building Regulation Part K1 1.12\)* **3-8 People and movement**  
These additional yet very sensible requirements suggest that  
guarding should be designed to accomplish the following\:  
• Prevent children being held fast by the guarding  
• Ensure that a 100 mm sphere cannot pass through any openings  
in the guarding  
• Prevent children from readily being able to climb the guarding.  
# 5 MECHANICAL MOVEMENT WITHIN  
# BUILDINGS  
# 5.1 Introduction  
Mechanical devices for moving people around buildings are now  
essential aspects of all large building design and they involve signif-  
icant energy demands and safety backups for when energy supplies  
are restricted. Before reliable and safe systems were produced, the  
effective height of buildings was restricted to the number of sto-  
reys individuals would be happy to walk up. It is worth noting that  
mechanical systems are often found to be a compromise between  
moving small number of people very quickly \(with a low overall  
population movement\) and moving large numbers of people more  
slowly \(with high overall population movement\).  
# 5.2 Escalators  
Escalators are essentially moving staircases but where the people  
on them are expected to remain standing on one step while the step  
itself moves. For this reason, the rise and going are not governed  
by the same criteria as normal stairs. It is also why climbing a static  
escalator is more difficult than conventional stairs.  
• Escalators typically operate at speeds of 0.5 m/s to 0.65 m/s  
\(0.75 m/s in London Underground\).  
• Escalators are normally constructed at 30° incline.  
• People walk up stairs typically at 0.5 m/s.  
• Depending on the design \(speeds and width\), escalators can  
move more than 10000 people per hour.  
The standard shape of an escalator is provided by a steel truss that  
supplies the framework to support the moving staircase between  
storeys \(see Figure 3.14\). The individual steps in an escalator are  
roughly triangular in section and connected to two different guid-  
ing tracks that loop around the system and govern the relative  
position of each step as well as the movement. One track is the  
driving mechanism \(chain\) where the leading edge of the step is  
connected on each side and the step is essentially pulled around  
the loop in this way. The lower edge simply follows with two  
wheels located in a guiding track. This follows the main drive  
chain but by altering the relative position of the track to the drive  
chain, the position of each step is changed. By altering the space  
between the two loops, the steps are kept horizontal through-  
out the journey and as the pitch flattens at the top and bottom,  
they fold onto each other. This process is assisted by a series of  
grooves where each step fits together with the next in a tongue  
and groove alignment.  
The movement of an escalator is powered by an electric motor  
housed within the truss and geared to move the drive chain and the  
handrail as required keeping it aligned with the steps. The handrail  
is simply a synthetic rubber conveyor belt looped around a similar  
path but off set from the main step drive mechanism.  
Design and construction considerations\:  
Clear access areas should be provided equal to twice the escala-  
tor tread width in length and the escalator tread width plus 100  
mm either side in overall width.  
Minimum clear headroom of 2130 mm \(measured vertically from  
the pitch line\) should be maintained across the whole of the system.  
The handrail should have 100 mm clearance horizontally and 25  
mm clearance vertically from any adjacent surfaces.  
All connecting floor surfaces should be continuous with any  
abrupt change in level limited to a maximum of 6 mm.  
\(*Source\: Kone’s Escalators and Autowalks Planning*  
*Guide*, p. 49, Section 6.2, parts A to D\)  
Escalator handling capacity \(Ce\) in people per minute can be  
calculated using\:  
Ce = 60 \(*V k s*\)  
where\: *V* is the speed along the incline \(m/s\)  
*k* is the average density of people \(people per step\)  
*s* is the number of steps per metre \(m\) e.g. for a 400 mm  
step rise, *s* = 2.5  
Step density is theoretically related to escalator width where\:  
600 mm wide *k* = 1.0  
800 mm wide *k* = 1.5  
1000 mm wide *k* = 2.0  
People tend not to fill escalator stairs to capacity, so use half these  
values.  
An example from Table II indicates a 1000 mm wide step at  
0.50 m/s will carry 150 people per minute, in reality this should be  
assumed to be 75 people per minute or 4500 people per hour.

# 5.3 Moving walkways  
Moving walkways \(or a mechanised passenger conveyor system\)  
can be assumed to have the same design and performance char-  
acteristics as escalators, moving similar amounts of people and  
subject to similar speed and operating mechanics \(Figure 3.15\).  
They generally come in two forms. The pallet variety is simply a  
flat escalator with individual steps \(pallets\) running horizontally  
\(or inclined as required\). These do have a potential advantage due  
to the interconnection provided by extended grooves between each **People and movement 3-9**  
**3.15** *A one-speed mechanised passenger conveyor system, may be flat, or up to 12° for prams, shopping trolleys, etc., or up to 15° for*  
*special installations. Other systems available permit ‘valley’ and ‘hill’ longitudinal profiles; also surface laying of conveyor on drive*

*0.45–0.6 m/s. Tread widths, 1000–1400 mm*  
step, allowing the speed to be varied over the journey. The grooves  
close up at lower embarking and disembarking speeds but increase  
during the middle higher speed portion of the journey. The second  
form has a continuous conveyor belt constructed of metal belts or  
rubber walkways running over rollers.  
# 5.4 Lifts  
In most circumstances, a passenger lift is the most suitable method  
of vertical transportation within buildings. Because of their reliance  
on a power source, they should always also have a fire protected  
stair access provided as well. They also come in a wide range of  
sizes from a simple two storey hydraulic lift to the sophisticated  
operating systems needed in 100 storey skyscrapers. A lift car size  
of 2000 mm wide by 1400 mm deep will provide adequate space for  
any wheelchair and a number of other users although Figure 3.16  
illustrates the minimum size required.  
A well-designed passenger lift provision will include most,  
if not all, of the inclusive design principles. However, in certain  
refurbishment situations, a full scale lift provision is not possible  
**3.16** *Lift design – key minimum dimensions Source\:* Building  
Regulation Part M Diagram 11  
and in those cases, specific wheelchair platform stairlift or lifting  
platform may be suitable. Wheelchair platform stairlifts differ from  
lifting platforms in that they take a single wheelchair up a flight of  
stairs by means of a mechanical rail and traction device. Lifting  
platforms by contrast raise a platform that can accommodate a  
wheelchair plus attendant or partially sighted people over a cer-  
tain vertical distance. These can be relatively short distances such  
as negotiating a change in level or more fully enclosed journeys  
between storeys.  
# 5.5 Wheelchair platform stairlifts and lifting platforms  
Where a platform stairlift is installed, the minimum stair widths  
need to be increased to accommodate the extra width required  
by the stairlift \(Figure 3.17\). They also require a platform of 800  
mm wide and 1250 mm deep and are limited to a speed of 0.15  
m/s. In addition, they should also have controls that restrict usage  
to those in need and authorised to do so. These controls should  
include a ‘continuous pressure’ control device where if the pressure  
is released, the lift comes to a halt.  
# 5.6 Lifting platforms  
Lifting platforms, like stairlifts, are not replacements for a good  
passenger lift service and therefore are also not ideal. Both require  
the continuous pressure control device which can be too strenuous  
for some users to maintain. Lifting platforms have the same speed  
restriction and minimum platform size for single wheelchair users.  
In addition, however, they are also restricted to a 2000 mm travel  
if they are not enclosed. Where they are enclosed, the minimum  
dimensions increase to 900 mm wide and 1400 mm deep and if  
the wheelchair user has an attendant, to 1100 mm wide and 1400  
mm deep.  
# 5.7 Hydraulic lifts  
These lifts appear the same as any other standard lift design in  
that the most apparent aspect, the lift car, would not be any dif-  
ferent. The difference lies in the driving mechanism \(Figure 3.18\).  
Hydraulic lifts use a hydraulic ram to move the lift car between sto-  
reys and because it consists of a piston that is forced upwards by a  
fluid pumping system \(usually oil\) they are limited to the structural **3-10 People and movement**  
**3.17** *Details of stair lift for wheelchair, or for seated passenger \(Source\: Gimson Stairlifts Ltd\)*  
and height restrictions of the piston. Some use a hole in the ground  
to house the piston when fully descended, others use telescopic  
pistons. The mechanism is relatively simple in that an electrically  
operated pump forces the fluid from a reservoir into the piston  
to ascend and a valve allows and controls the returning oil when  
descending. Even if the reservoir were to fail, the action of having  
to force the oil back through the system means that hydraulic lifts  
would return to ground level fairly slowly and therefore also safely.  
In action, as the ascending lift car approaches the correct floor, a  
control system gradually reduces the pumping speed. At each floor,  
with the pump off, the oil in the cylinder cannot flow back through  
the pump and, with the valve closed, the car is supported by the  
full piston. To descend, the control system opens the valve so that  
the oil in the cylinder can return to the reservoir. It is the weight  
of the car and contents that push down on the piston driving the oil  
back into the reservoir. To stop the car at a lower floor, the control  
system simply closes the valve.  
Although a very safe mechanism, hydraulic lifts are limited in  
**3.18** *Schematic diagram of a direct-acting hydraulic lift with* scope because of the length of pistons required and also because  
*remote machine room* they are relatively energy intensive when compared with the alternative traction system. In raising a lift car and its contents, a  
hydraulic system has to produce all of the required power via the  
pump to overcome the force of gravity for the full weight of the  
lift car and load. In a traction system, the weight of the lift car is  
balanced by a counterweight so that moving only the difference in  
weights requires power.  
# 5.8 Traction lifts  
The most common design for lifts is the traction variety where the  
lift car is raised and lowered by steel wire ropes attached to the  
car and looped around a sheave. In effect a pulley, the sheave has  
grooves around the edge, designed and shaped to grip the ropes so  
that a rotating sheave moves the ropes simply because of the friction  
between the two. In higher speed lifts, the ropes are wrapped around  
the sheave twice to provide extra friction. A traction lift therefore  
works by an electric motor turning the sheave directly \(or via a gear-  
ing system\), either one way or another to ascend or descend.  
The great advantage of traction lifts is that the ropes are also  
connected to a counterweight on the other side of the sheave. The  
counterweight is normally designed to balance the lift car at 40  
per cent capacity, considered to be the average load in use. When  
loaded equally like this, the sheave motor has little work to do in  
moving the lift up or down. In addition to guide rails in the lift  
shaft, traction lifts usually locate the sheave, motor and control  
system in a machine room above the lift shaft, adding to the over-  
all height required as well as the overall structural loading on the  
building \(Figure 3.19\).  
**3.19** *Schematic diagram of a conventional electric traction lift*  
*with high-level machine room*  
The safety of traction systems depends on two fundamental princi-  
ples. Firstly, the fear that a rope may snap or become disconnected  
is overcome by using multiple ropes; typically, four to eight wound  
steel wire ropes where each rope individually can support the lift  
car. Secondly, they will also use a braking system. Physical braking  
systems typically use a governor and sprung flyweights that acti-  
vate when the lift is travelling too fast and then through linkages  
bring the braking system into operation. Electromagnetic braking  
systems keep the brakes open in normal operation so that a loss of  
power would trigger them. They can also be used as part of the con-  
trol system at each stop. In addition to overrun braking protection  
at the top and bottom of shafts, a heavy-duty piston shock absorber  
system at the bottom will cushion a runaway car’s landing.  
• Gearless traction lifts – the industry standard – typically operate  
at speeds in excess of 2.5 m/s.  
• Geared traction lifts – more efficient – typically operated at  
speeds between 1.75 and 2.5 m/s \(Otis 2011\).

# 5.9 Design of lift systems  
The design of lift systems is a complicated and in most instances,  
a specialist operation. This is because of the very many parameters  
involved including such things as the number of lifts available, the  
populations being served, usage patterns \(peak flows\), number of  
storeys being served and also the quality of the service required,  
to name just a few. Specialist design services will include eval-  
uation of ‘round trip times’, passenger demands, limitations and  
assumptions around peak traffic flows as well as car size, number  
and location, clearly well beyond the scope of this chapter. Yet  
there is some basic information that is useful and can form the basis  
of ongoing design work.  
# 5.10 Handling capacity of lifts  
It is important to recognise that lifts provide a different service to  
that of stairs and escalators discussed previously. Where escala-  
tors can carry large amounts of people relatively slowly, lifts carry  
much smaller amounts much more quickly.  
• A previous example showed a relatively small 1000 mm wide  
escalator at 0.50 m/s carrying 75 people per minute or 4500 peo-  
ple per hour.  
• The most efficient group of 8 lifts serving 14 floors at full 21  
person capacity can only handle 50 people per minute or 3000  
people per hour.  
• Take that down to 3 lifts in 8 storeys at 10-person capacity and  
the figure reduces to 16 people per minute or 960 people per hour.  
# 5.11 Location and number of cars  
The most efficient design layout for lift lobbies is in a cul-de-sac  
layout as indicated in Figures 3.20 and 3.21 as it provides the  
shortest distance from any waiting position; it also provides the  
best view of all lifts in operation and, most importantly, it avoids  
obstruction by passers-by.  
**3.20** *Plan of recessed lobby and machine room for multi-lift*  
*installation – dimensions refer to the values in Table IV*  
**3.21** *Plan of cul-de-sac lobby and machine room – dimensions*  
*refer to the values in Table IV* **3-12 People and movement**  
Lift cars are rated by their load capacity in kilograms and the  
number of people they can carry. The load capacity is defined in  
EN81\(1998\) and must not be exceeded but people capacity ratings  
can be misleading and experience has found that in reality, the fig-  
ure should be adjusted for variations in people size, luggage etc.  
A further reduction comes from statistical analysis of passenger  
behaviour suggesting that a 20 per cent reduction should be applied  
to get the true capacity of individual cars.  
In very tall buildings, where the number of lift cars becomes  
very large to serve all storeys from the access point, ‘sky lobbies’  
provide an intermediate access point where a specific lift will only  
take people to this point for further distribution at higher ‘local’  
levels.  
Table III provides a range of information on the number of lift  
cars required to serve various storeys for a typical office building  
with associated population numbers per floor.  
Table IV provides information on design capacity, rated capac-  
ity, car size and the required structural size requirements for two  
different lift traffic systems.  
# Table III Lift car requirements  
Effective lift system design is a specialist design function but some basic  
assumptions can be made relating to the number of cars to the number of storeys and  
populations served.

Inclusive design is about making places everyone can use.  
The inclusive design process is just as important in the briefing  
and master planning stages as it is in the design of individual  
components/built elements. The built environment should facil-  
itate independence, not only in the built form, but also in green  
space strategies, social infrastructure planning, housing and  
transportation.  
# 1 INCLUSIVE DESIGN  
# 1.1 Scope  
This chapter deals with inclusive and accessible design for  
non-dwellings. For dwellings, refer to Chapter 22 Houses and flats,  
Chapter 23 Housing for older people and Chapter 24 Housing for  
students and young people.  
# 1.2 Design principles  
Good design reflects the diverse nature of people and does not  
impose barriers of any kind, whether physical, cultural or social.  
The design of the built environment can form barriers that are, or  
can become, disabling to all people. Designing inclusively guar-  
antees accessibility to all and considers age, social circumstance,  
gender, disability, sexual orientation and faith.  
The British Standards Institution’s \(BSI\) BS 7000–6\:2005  
*Design management systems* – *Part 6*\: *Managing inclusive design*  
identified that inclusive design recognises diversity by addressing  
the ability and preferences of people, covering elements such as  
age, disability, culture, gender, allergies and cognitive abilities.  
Making environments easy to use for everyone requires consider-  
ation other than just physical factors – it is also about experience.  
How people feel when using a building or space is of equal impor-  
tance to their physical needs.  
The Design Council’s Inclusive Design Hub advises that apply-  
ing the following five principles of inclusive design from the outset  
can help achieve an accessible and inclusive environment\:  
• Place people at the heart of the design process  
• Acknowledge diversity and difference  
• Offer choice where a single design solution cannot accommodate  
all users  
• Provide for flexibility in use  
• Provide buildings and environments that are convenient and  
enjoyable for everyone to use.  
BS 8300–1\:2018 and BS 8300–2\:2018 *Design of an accessible*  
*and inclusive built environment – Code of Practice* \(BS 8300\) set  
out the importance of integrating inclusive design principles into  
the development process in order to achieve the desired outcome of  
inclusive and accessible environments.

# 1.3 Regulations and guidance  
In the United Kingdom, Building Regulations or Technical  
Standards form a starting point in determining minimal spatial cri-  
teria for delivering accessible environments for non-dwellings. In  
England and Wales, these are set out in Approved Documents of  
the Building Regulations Part K and Part M, Technical Booklet  
R in Northern Ireland and the Building Standards Technical  
Handbook in Scotland. However, following building regulation  
provision does not necessarily deliver inclusive projects, as set out  
in the five principles mentioned previously. Here, the goal of cre-  
ating aesthetic and functional environments that provide equity of  
experience for everyone requires a creative and inclusive design  
process that carries through the building design process and deliv-  
ery into day-to-day use and management practice.  
A simple demonstration of this is as follows. The design of a  
new building incorporates steps that conform to the provisions of  
the building regulations. With the inclusion of steps, the design  
team add a ramp that also conforms to regulation, in that it pro-  
vides step-free access. This ‘bolt-on’ solution is ‘accessible’ but  
not ‘inclusive’ as it separates those who can and those who cannot  
use the steps. An inclusive approach, for instance, might challenge  
if the stairs were necessary in the first place and if they could be  
eliminated entirely or ameliorated by changing the approach by  
gently grading the approaches.  
Good practice guidelines such as BS 8300 should be drawn  
upon in order to go beyond minimum requirements if an inclusive  
environment is to be achieved.  
For sport-specific approaches, see Sport England’s Design  
Guidance Note *Accessible sport facilities* with detailed commentary  
and spatial requirements. BS 8300 does not have detailed guidance  
for stadia. For development of stadia and similar venues, the Sports  
Grounds Safety Authority’s \(SGSA\) *Guide to Safety at Sports*  
*Grounds* \(also known as the ‘Green Guide’\) 6th edition should be  
used in conjunction with *Accessible stadia* and *Accessible stadia*  
*supplementary guidance* also published by the SGSA.  
Although withdrawn, the recommendations of Building  
Bulletin 102 *Designing for disabled children and children with*  
*special educational needs* are essential to incorporate early in the  
design process \(it is worth noting that although the areas guidance  
is superseded by Building Bulletin 104, the general guidance is still  
relevant\).  
Additionally, consideration must be given to local planning pol-  
icy and any supplementary guidance or documents. For instance,  
the Greater London Authority set out a comprehensive approach  
to meeting their planning policy requirement for inclusive envi-  
ronments with the publication of *Accessible London\: achieving an*  
*inclusive environment*.

# 1.4 Equality Act 2010 and inclusive design  
The Equality Act 2010 \(the Act\) provides the legal framework in  
Great Britain protecting people from discrimination. It unified a  
range of existing discrimination legislation including supersed-  
ing the Disability Discrimination Acts 1995 and 2005 \(DDA\). It  
is essential in creating and delivering inclusive environments to  
understand the overarching principles of the Act.  
The Act created a piece of anti-discrimination legislation across  
nine ‘protected characteristics’. These are\:  
• Age  
• Disability  
• Gender reassignment  
• Marriage and civil partnership  
• Pregnancy and maternity  
• Race  
• Religion or belief  
• Sex  
• Sexual orientation.  
In taking an inclusive design approach, all protected char-  
acteristics should be considered. Disability is the only protected  
characteristic that has specified duties relating to adjustments to the  
built environment and the need to remove physical barriers, as well  
as providing auxiliary aids and/or auxiliary services.  
The ‘reasonable adjustments’ duty within the Act imposes  
a duty on employers, service providers and public functions to  
make reasonable adjustments to any physical feature which may  
put a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage compared to  
non-disabled people. This is not a minimalist policy of simply  
ensuring that some access is available to disabled people. Instead,  
as far as is reasonably practicable, it approximates the access  
enjoyed by disabled people to that enjoyed by the rest of the public.  
The Equality Act is not a design standard, and does not impose  
design criteria. The Act does not have specific and defined provision  
for the built environment and therefore, physical features cannot  
be ‘compliant’, nor can any product be ‘compliant’. Although the  
Act does not cover physical features or auxiliary aids for protected  
characteristics other than disability, there is a general duty for all  
public bodies under the Public Sector Duty to have due regard to  
the need to advance equality of opportunity for people covered by  
protected characteristics.  
The design of built environment may create barriers to people  
with protected characterises other than disability, and therefore,  
further consideration should be given to delivering inclusion for  
everyone rather than ‘compliance’ with the more narrowly defined  
legal obligation. It is also important to consider the intersectionality  
of the protected characteristics set out in the Act, as a disabled per-  
son might also be protected by one or more of the other protected  
characteristics as well. An example of this would be provision of  
accessible prayer facilities, or access to appropriate sanitary facili-  
ties for people undergoing gender reassignment.  
The Equality Act does not apply to Northern Ireland, where the  
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Special Educational  
Needs and Disability \(NI\) Order 2005 continue to give disabled  
people important rights not to be discriminated against.  
# 1.5 Design process  
In order to deliver inclusive environments, the principles of inclu-  
sive design must be integrated into the design process from the  
outset. Making environments easy to use for everyone requires  
consideration other than just physical factors. These include, but  
are not limited to, signage/way-finding, information systems,  
lighting, visual contrast, controls and door furniture, interactive  
displays and materials.  
Inclusive design relates as much to the design process as to the  
final product, bonding user-experience with professional expertise  
and management practice. The process extends from inception,  
through the planning process, detailed design and construction to  
occupation, management and operation.  
The goal of creating aesthetic and functional environments that  
can be used equally by everyone, irrespective of age, gender, faith  
or disability, requires a creative and inclusive design process work-  
ing towards accommodating a diverse range of users.  
Following the minimum provisions of the building regulations,  
or dimensional criteria within good practice guidance alone, will  
not deliver inclusive projects. For this, the close involvement of  
design team, client, stakeholder groups and end-users are required.  
# 1.6 RIBA Plan of Work  
The RIBA Plan of Work provides a framework for architects to  
use with their clients, bringing greater clarity to the different stages  
of a project. The National Register of Access Consultants set out  
a process for delivering inclusive environments to align with the  
2013 version of the Plan of Work. Table I highlights and explains  
what activity should be undertaken at each RIBA work stage to  
embed the principles of inclusive design from project inception to  
completion. It is important that the inclusive design process should  
be documented, reviewed and monitored throughout the different  
stages of the project. Though now superseded, this is still a useful  
reference to the inclusive design inputs at each stage.  
In 2020, RIBA revised the Plan of Work to address changes in  
the industry such as digital innovation, modern methods of con-  
struction, and changes in project drivers, including delivering best  
value and an increased awareness of ethics. For the first time, the  
Plan of Work now incorporates an inclusive design strategy. RIBA  
acknowledges that accessibility and inclusion for disabled people  
is a firm policy of Government and the aspiration and expectation  
of the general public. The Plan of Work identifies that the inclu-  
sive design strategy should consider all of these and be developed  
at the outset and implemented over the building’s useful life. The  
codes of practice that form the two parts of BS 8300\:2018 provide  
a detailed breakdown of the contents of an inclusive design strategy  
for each stage of a project.  
# 1.7 User engagement  
User consultation and the involvement of local people, including local  
disabled people’s groups, also help to highlight particular, sometimes  
local, access issues that need to be addressed. People are the experts in  
their own lived experience and the barriers they face. Giving excluded  
people the opportunity to bring their personal experiences into the  
design process through co-design enriches design development. This  
was the case with the design of the climbing experience Up at the O2  
in Greenwich, London \(Figure 4.1\), which has been made accessible  
to a wide range of disabled people including wheelchair users.  
# 2 PEOPLE  
# 2.1 Disability  
Under the Equality Act 2010 a person is considered disabled if  
they have a physical or mental impairment that has a ‘substan-  
tial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect on their ability to do normal  
daily activities. It is estimated that approximately 21 per cent of  
the UK population \(14.1 million people\) are disabled, according to  
the Department for Work and Pension’s *Family resources survey*  
2018/2019.  
While the spatial requirements of people with mobility impair-  
ments, including wheelchair users, are important in terms of  
designing the physical environment, it is necessary to understand  
the barriers experienced by people with a broad range of access  
requirements, which could be sensory, cognitive, physical or relate  
to neurodiversity.  
In general, designing to provide access, whether physical or  
intellectual, will yield results that benefit the community at large.  
Many aspects of an inclusively designed environment will be **Inclusive and accessible design 4-3**

be addressed when designing inclusively. According to the *Family*  
*resources survey*, in 2018/19 there were\:  
• 6.8 million disabled people with a mobility related disability  
• 5.1 million people with difficulties with ‘stamina/breathing or  
fatigue’  
• 3.7 million people with a ‘manual dexterity’ related disability  
• 2.3 million people with memory impairment  
• 3.8 million people with a mental health support need  
• 1.8 million people with a hearing related disability  
• 1.7 million people with a vision related disability  
• 1.3 million people with a learning difficulty  
• 1.3 million people with social/behavioural related disability.  
The RNID has identified that in the UK there are 12 million  
adults with hearing loss greater than 25 dBHL. This is equivalent  
to one in five adults.  
The National Autistic Society indicates that one in 100 people  
are on the autism spectrum. There are around 700000 autistic adults  
and children in the UK.  
# 2.3 Neurodiversity  
Neurodiversity is an umbrella term referring to a group of neu-  
rological conditions which share common features, in particular  
differences in how people learn and process information. Definitions  
vary, but the term covers conditions such as dyslexia and dyscalcu-  
lia, dyspraxia and developmental coordination disorder, learning  
disabilities, attention deficit disorders \(ADD/ADHD\), mental health  
diversity and autistic spectrum \(Autism/Asperger’s syndrome\).  
Neurodiversity is a form of human diversity. The idea that there  
is one ‘normal’ or ‘healthy’ type of brain or mind or one ‘right’  
style of neurocognitive functioning is no more valid than the idea  
that there is one ‘normal’ or ‘right’ gender, race or culture. We all  
have differing neurological needs.  
There is very little detailed guidance on the design of the  
built environment and neurodiversity. To address this, the British  
Standards Institute is expected to publish PAS 6463 *Design for the*  
*mind – Neurodiversity and the built environment* in 2022.  
The nature of neurodiversity is that people interact with the  
built environment differently, and on that basis, there may not be  
a single solution. While it is advisable to minimise factors that  
cause difficulties within the environment in general, it may not be  
possible to deliver environments suitable for everyone. A key aim  
should be to create environments in which people are able to either  
adapt a space to suit their needs or find a space in which they can  
manage their needs.  
Sensory overload is a common issue; this could be visual,  
audible, olfactory or spatial. Examples of this may be manifested  
through poor acoustics and overbearing background noise, signif-  
icant reflection or glare, patterned surfaces that do not incorporate  
natural forms, or the lack of personal space or defensible space  
\(that is, quiet space in which people feel secure and gain respite  
from the overstimulation\). The converse may also be true, as there  
are people with hyposensitivity that need the opportunity of gain-  
ing sensory stimulus.  
The availability of calm spaces, logical layouts and defined  
way-finding and orientation are also important factors to be  
addressed, as are the memorability and familiarity of space.  
# 2.4 An ageing population\: the implications for design  
The UK’s population is getting older and, as a result, the pro-  
portion of the population that are aged 65 or over is significantly  
increasing. Age UK’s publication *Later Life in the United Kingdom*  
identified that there are 11.6 million people aged 65 or over in the  
UK, and over a third of the overall population are aged 50 years or  
older. The number of people aged 60 or over is expected to pass the  
20 million mark by 2030. The number of people aged 65 or over is  
projected to rise by over 40 per cent in the next 17 years to over 16  
million; by 2040 it is expected that nearly one in four people will  
be aged 65 or over.  
The Office for National Statistics identified that by 2039 the  
number of people aged 75 and over is projected to rise by 89.3 per  
cent to 9.9 million; more than 1 in 12 of the population is projected  
to be aged 80 or over, while the number of people aged 85 and over  
is projected to more than double, reaching 3.6 million.  
Amongst all people in the United Kingdom, 21 per cent reported  
a disability in 2018/19, an increase from 19 per cent in 2008/09.  
Many older people have, or will have, an impairment of some kind.  
There is a demonstrable correlation between age and disability.  
The *Family resources survey* identified that 8 per cent of children  
were disabled compared to 19 per cent of adults of working age; of  
adults over state pension age 44 per cent were disabled. In addition,  
the average number of years that people survive with a disability or  
long-term illness is increasing.  
People also tend to shrink slightly with age. More significantly,  
the body tends to be less flexible in regard to adapting to dimen-  
sionally unfavourable situations. Older people tend to have more  
than one impairment. It is, therefore, critical that design also allows  
for older people.  
A further consideration is dementia. The Alzheimer’s Society  
estimates that there are approximately 850000 people with dementia  
in the UK, a figure likely to increase to 1.6 million people by 2040.  
# 2.5 Children and adolescents  
Where facilities are to be used solely by small children, specific  
heights should be adjusted to meet their requirements. There are  
approximately four million children aged five or under. Therefore,  
design in general should also consider the needs of younger chil-  
dren, for example, when providing family facilities or sinks at  
lower heights in toilets. There is limited guidance on the design of  
the built environment for disabled children, and consultation with  
stakeholders can provide invaluable information based on practice  
and precedent.  
Disabled children and young people currently face multiple bar-  
riers, making it more difficult for them to achieve their potential, to  
achieve the outcomes their peers expect and to succeed in education.  
Disabled parents and carers of children should also be consid-  
ered at all stages of the design process. Where family facilities  
are provided, for example baby changing rooms, these should be  
accessible to both disabled and non-disabled parents/carers.  
# 2.6 Large people  
Obesity is more common among people from areas of higher depri-  
vation, older age groups, some ethnic minority groups and disabled  
people. The *Health Survey for England* 2019 found that 68 per cent of  
men and 60 per cent of women are overweight \(BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2\) or  
obese \(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2\). Obesity prevalence rose between 1993 and  
2019 from 13 to 27 per cent for men and from 16 to 29 per cent for  
women. The survey found that one in five children in reception year  
are overweight or obese, rising to one in three children in Year 6.  
Both raised BMI and very high waist circumference are thought  
to be independent predictors of future obesity-related ill health, and  
are considered predictive measures for identifying an individual’s  
risk of obesity-related conditions including high cholesterol, high  
blood pressure, diabetes, bone and joint problems, and breathing  
difficulties – as well as premature adult mortality.  
Pregnant women, like larger people, can also be disadvantaged  
by the design of the environment. Long routes and stairs can be  
very tiring; narrow seats, doors and small toilet cubicles are other  
common barriers.  
In certain buildings such as football stadia, deliberately narrow  
doorways are used to ensure control over entry. In these cases, and  
also where turnstiles are used, additional provision for large people  
should be made.  
Where there is fixed seating, for example in a theatre, there  
should be a number of easily accessed amenity seats, which may **Inclusive and accessible design 4-5**  
have increased width and legroom, have removable arms or fold-  
down arms and may include a space for an assistance dog.  
# 2.7 Mobility ranges  
Many people with a mobility related disability find covering long  
distances a significant barrier. The Department for Transport’s  
*Inclusive Mobility* publication identified that of disabled people  
who were able to walk, approximately 30 per cent could manage no  
more than 50 m without stopping or severe discomfort. A further  
20 per cent could only manage between 50 and 200 m.  
Mobility ranges vary enormously between individuals with age  
and disability, while factors such as weather, topography \(gradi-  
ents\) and obstacles can also affect mobility ranges. In pedestrian  
schemes, extended travel distances should be avoided where rea-  
sonable and practicable. Where gradients exist, the distance people  
can traverse should be reduced. Conversely, the provision of seat-  
ing and resting places can extend the distance people can traverse.  
The recommended maximum distance on level ground between  
resting places should be no more than 50 m.  
much movement of the torso\) or maximum or extended \(just  
possible with movement of the torso\). *Inclusive Mobility* gives fig-  
ures for comfortable and extended reach ranges; see Table II and  
Figures 4.2 and 4.3.  
When considering reach ranges, it is important to consider the  
need for appropriate design solutions that provide for people with  
a range of heights \(people of short stature and people above aver-  
age height as well as wheelchair users\). However, it is important  
to remember that designing features that are easily accessible to a  
wheelchair user may exclude other people, for example, an ambu-  
lant disabled person who is unable to bend down easily. More than  
one solution might be required. For instance, if all work surfaces  
are designed for use by wheelchair users, this could have a dispro-  
portionately negative ergonomic impact for people of tall stature.  
Therefore, adjustable height work surfaces or a choice of work sur-  
face heights should be provided, rather than designing one solution  
for all.  
# 2.8 Reach and height  
The distance and angle that an individual can reach is dependent on  
their size, agility, dexterity and whether they are seated or stand-  
ing. The ability of a seated person, for example, in a wheelchair to  
reach forward, sideways, upwards or downwards is different from  
someone standing.  
Reach distance forms an arc, based on shoulder level. Reach  
range can be described as easy or comfortable \(reach without  
# 3 MOBILITY EQUIPMENT  
# 3.1 General considerations  
It is important to consider the additional space requirements for  
people using mobility aids, people with assistance dogs, and parents  
and carers with children in pushchairs, particularly along circula-  
tion routes, barriers/gate lines and spaces required to manoeuvre  
outside lifts or at building elements such as reception desks or  
servery counters.

1 Horizontal reference plane. **4-6 Inclusive and accessible design**  
Wheelchair users need quite a lot of space to move comfortably  
and safely. People who walk with two sticks may require a wider  
circulatory route than someone using a wheelchair. It is worth not-  
ing that a double pushchair may be wider than an occupied electric  
wheelchair.  
# 3.2 Wheelchair and scooter users  
The range of wheelchair dimensions is considerable, particularly  
given the overall length and width that an occupied wheelchair may  
extend to. The figures given for the width of a wheelchair user do  
not usually make allowance for their elbows and hands. To propel  
a wheelchair manually, a clearance of not less than 50 mm, prefer-  
ably 100 mm, on both sides is required.  
The maximum length a conventional wheelchair user with  
leg-supports or an electric mobility scooter is likely to occupy is  
1600 mm. Conventionally seated wheelchair users do not usually  
occupy a length of more than approximately 1250 mm. However,  
if a wheelchair user has a companion then the combined length of  
the space they occupy will be typically 1375 mm – design guidance  
allows for 1570 mm.  
The average height of wheelchair users is 1080 mm but can  
range as high as 1535 mm. The average height of a scooter user is  
approximately 1170 mm but can range as high as a maximum of  
1500 mm.  
In designing for wheelchair users, the critical dimensions are\:  
• Eye height, around 120–130 mm below seated height, giving a  
5th–95th per cent range for wheelchair users from 960 to 1250  
mm \(1080–1315 mm for scooter users\)  
• Knee height, 500–690 mm  
• Seat height, 460–490 mm  
• Ankle height, manual wheelchair users, 175–300 mm; electric  
wheelchair users, 380–520 mm  
• Height to bottom of foot support, 60–150 mm.  
# 3.3 Wheelchair-user dimensions  
These dimensions exclude the wheelchair user and only consider  
length and width; see Figure 4.4. Dimensions in Table III are given  
for occupied and unoccupied wheelchairs over a range of wheel-  
chair types including scooters.  
# 3.4 Pushchair dimensions  
The length and width dimensions of child pushchairs are highly  
variable. There is not, as is the case with manual wheelchairs, a  
standard model for informing design criteria. Figure 4.5 gives com-  
mon dimensions.

Electric scooter 1170–1600 1170–1500 630–700 620–640  
# 3.5 Turning spaces  
Mobility aid vehicles clearly need adequate space to turn around  
and this will need to be considered in particular along circulation  
routes and in queue systems; see Tables IV and V. Figures 4.6 and  
4.7 demonstrate the spaces required for wheelchairs performing  
90° and 180° turns.  
# 3.6 Considerations for people that use a stick, cane or  
# crutches  
It is important to consider people who are blind or partially sighted  
who use a cane \(see Figure 4.8\) and people with a mobility impair-  
ment who may prefer to walk using crutches \(see Figure 4.9\) or  
with a frame \(see Figure 4.10\).  
Some people who use crutches use them for a short time follow-  
ing an accident and will be inexpert in their use. Users fall into two **Inclusive and accessible design 4-7**

those who have use of only one leg. Those who can use only one

# 3.7 Space provision for assistance dogs  
Assistance dogs include guide dogs and hearing dogs. While peo-  
ple primarily with sensory related disabilities have an assistance  
dog, people with limited mobility and wheelchair users may also  
have an assistance dog. *Inclusive Mobility* identifies that people  
with assistance dogs require a clear unobstructed width of at least  
1100 mm.  
# 4 BUILT ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS  
# 4.1 Scope  
Many elements, such as the design of religious facilities, trans-  
port infrastructure, master planning, schools, libraries as well as  
features such as stair design and so forth are detailed in the other  
chapters of the *Metric Handbook*. The following advice supple-  
ments the other chapters and follows the macro to the minutia of  
the design process.  
# 4.2 Inclusive neighbourhoods  
Inclusive neighbourhoods help to build cohesive, successful and  
sustainable communities.  
There is no defined content of an inclusive neighbourhood, but  
it should be recognised that access to good quality accessible and  
inclusive social infrastructure is vital. Social infrastructure covers a  
wide range of facilities such as health provision, educational, com-  
munity, cultural, play, recreation and sports facilities, and green  
infrastructure. Inclusion in the widest sense should be married with  
environmental, economic and social sustainability. As well as look-  
ing at physical factors, this should also address health impacts that  
create unintentional barriers for under-represented groups.  
One underlying concept that supports inclusive neighbourhoods  
is – like that of lifetime homes – making neighbourhoods adaptable  
and addressing peoples’ differing needs over the different stages of  
their lives. An inclusive neighbourhood should be welcoming, easy  
to move around, enjoyable and somewhere they feel secure. There  
should be a focus on the inclusivity of connections and spaces  
between buildings, which are often overlooked.  
The Mayor of London’s *Accessible London* sets out three prin-  
ciples to support this concept. Neighbourhoods should be\:  
• Well connected, walkable and easy to get around  
• Have a choice of homes, accessible infrastructure and services,  
as well as places to spend time in, work in and with a mix of  
accessible and adaptable uses  
• Belong to a cohesive community which fosters diversity, social  
interaction and social capital.  
The London Legacy Development Corporation’s *Inclusive Design*  
*Standards* offer a good practice approach to delivering inclusive  
environments at a neighbourhood scale.  
# 4.3 Public realm  
The design of the external environment and the public realm is  
an essential consideration if an area is to be considered inclusive  
and accessible. Key consideration should be given to the provi-  
sion of a coordinated network of legible, safe and accessible routes.  
Elements to be considered are\:  
• Location and ease of access to public transport  
• Prioritisation of pedestrian movement over vehicles  
• Provision of natural surveillance and perception of safety  
• Easy-going gradients and equity of experience when overcom-  
ing changes in level  
• Quality of the paving/foot paths  
• Legibility of spaces and routes, particularly for people with  
dementia, or who are blind or partially sighted people  
• Lighting.  
A factor often overlooked is the provision of suitable acces-  
sible seating and resting points, which are essential for some  
disabled and older people if they wish to access the environment  
independently. The provision of some seating with armrests and  
backrests will cater for people with reduced mobility who find it  
difficult to raise or lower themselves into a seat. Space between  
seating allows access for wheelchair users to sit alongside their  
families and friends, or for a pushchair or buggy.  
# 4.4 Shared space  
The principles of shared space involve decluttering the streetscape  
by removing unnecessary obstacles and simplifying the area, all  
of which have benefits in terms of access and can add to inclu-  
sive design. However, the removal of kerbs can be problematic, as  
kerbs provide many disabled people with the confidence that they  
are segregated from traffic. Kerbs can provide blind and partially  
sighted people with a ‘shore-line’ to follow, helping them navigate  
an area particularly in the absence of a clear and uncluttered build-  
ing line to follow at the opposite edge of the pavement. Kerbs are  
also important, as they are required for taxi and bus ramps to be  
deployed safely, and for people stepping down from side access  
minibus transport.  
The Department for Transport’s *Cycle Infrastructure Design*  
LTN 1/20 replaces LTN 1/12 *Shared Use Routes for Pedestrians*  
*and Cyclists*. It identifies that a protected space, with appropriate  
physical demarcation, might need to be provided, so that those  
pedestrians who may be unable or unwilling to negotiate priority  
with vehicles can use the street safely and comfortably. Clearly  
defined safe crossing points should also be provided.  
There is a delicate balance between promoting active travel and  
creating schemes that protect pedestrians. LTN 1/20 indicates that  
shared use routes in streets with high pedestrian or cyclist flows  
should not be used. Instead, in these sorts of spaces distinct tracks  
for cyclists should be made, using sloping, pedestrian-friendly kerbs  
and/or different surfacing. Shared use routes away from streets may  
be appropriate in locations such as canal towpaths, paths through  
housing estates, parks and other green spaces, including in cities.  
Where cycle routes use such paths in built-up areas, they should be  
separated from pedestrians, perhaps at different levels or a kerb.  
Where shared space is proposed, early stakeholder engagement  
is a critical part of the design process. It should allow disabled  
and older people and representative organisations to be part of the  
design decision process. LTN 1/20 reaffirms that engaging with  
such groups is an important step towards a scheme meeting the  
local authority’s Public Sector Equality Duty.  
Careful consideration should also be given as to whether the  
area is suitable for such an approach, taking into account the vol-  
ume of pedestrians compared to traffic flows, and types of traffic  
using the area such as bicycles, buses, HGVs and so forth.  
To support independence for more vulnerable pedestrians, con-  
sideration should be given to the incorporation of a ‘safe zone’, to  
delineate optional routes specially for pedestrians only.  
# 4.5 Changes in level  
Changes in level cause problems for many people, particularly peo-  
ple with mobility impairments or people who are blind or partially  
sighted. Even a single step can prevent access for someone with  
mobility impairment and can present a trip hazard for all people.  
Any gradient less steep than 1\:60 can be considered level.  
Where changes in level cannot be avoided, slopes with as shallow  
a gradient as possible \(less steep than 1\:21\) should be provided as  
it is preferable to avoid the use of ramps \(a slope with a gradient of  
1\:20 or steeper\).  
If a ramp cannot be avoided, then it should conform to  
Figure 4.11. The maximum going of a flight must not exceed the  
maximum rise without intermediate landings. Ramps steeper than  
1\:12 should not be used, as they may be unsafe as some wheel-  
chair users may tip over on them. Good practice such as the London **Inclusive and accessible design 4-9**  
**4.11** *Maximum length of ramp at a given gradient \(Source\: From Approved Document K\)*  
Legacy Development Corporation’s *Inclusive Design Standards*  
suggest a ramp no steeper than 1\:15 should be used if a ramp is  
unavoidable.  
Slopes or ramps provide access for people who use wheels, such  
as wheelchair users or parents with pushchairs. However, some peo-  
ple may find it easier to negotiate a flight of steps than a ramp and  
for them, the presence of handrails for support is essential. Stepped  
routes within the public realm can also offer shorter routes and help  
avoid people needing to travel extended distances that they may  
find challenging to walk along if only graded ones are provided.  
However, stairs are not to be dissected by ramps or graded routes  
as to produce feathered/tapered steps. Where a change in level is no  
greater than 300 mm, a ramp may be acceptable as the only means  
of access, avoiding the need for steps. Otherwise, steps would also  
be required.  
It should be noted that if the level change exceeds 2 m, then  
the ramps become very difficult to use for many people including  
wheelchair users. There should be an alternative means of step-free  
access such as a lift. Where lifts are provided, the quality of the  
journey should not feel secondary. Stairs can promote well-being  
and their use should be encouraged. However, lifts should not be  
hidden as a result.  
Lifts should have a minimum car size of 1100 mm wide by 1400  
mm in depth \(classed in BS EN 81-70\:2018 as a Type 2 lift\). While  
complying with the minima set out in the building regulation, the  
use of this car size may preclude at least 5 to 10 per cent of wheel-  
chair users and scooter users because of the length of the car. The  
maximum length of mobility scooters identified in BS 8300 is 1600  
mm. For this reason, it is recommended that a Type 5 lift 2000  
mm by 1400 mm \(minimum\) should be adopted – where space and  
budget will allow.  
The design of suitable stairs will be dependent on a variety of  
factors such as location \(external or internal\), building type, floor-  
to-floor levels and other dimension constraints as well as whether  
they are fire escape stairs.  
Many people find long flights of stairs difficult to use; there-  
fore, the maximum recommended number of steps should be 12  
in a flight and no more than 20 if a suitable going \(300 mm or  
greater\) is provided. If there are successive flights, it is important  
there are resting places, at least 1200 mm long \(preferably 1800  
mm\) across the full width of the stair. There should be an unob-  
structed landing space at the top and bottom of a flight of stairs to  
avoid any collision.  
As a rule of thumb, a comfortable step will have a rise of between  
150 and 170 mm with a going between 300 and 425 mm deep.  
Stair risers should be closed, in part, because it removes the  
possibility of the front of a foot or a walking aide being caught  
underneath a tread during ascent, possible causing a fall, but also  
avoids the feeling of insecurity people get when looking through  
open risers on a stair. This therefore precludes the use of clear  
glazed risers.  
Steps without projecting nosings remove a potential trip hazard.  
If necessary, the projection of a step nosing over the tread should  
be a maximum of 25 mm. All nosings should be made apparent  
through visual contrast on both the riser and tread, which will assist  
people ascending and descending the stair.  
# 4.6 Parking  
Many disabled and older people are reliant on a car for independ-  
ence. Additional space for designated bays for disabled persons is  
vital. The driver of a vehicle or a passenger may be disabled. They  
may need to enter or leave the vehicle using a transfer hoist for  
their wheelchair, or they may require assistance to alight from the  
vehicle first. In some instances, a disabled person may need to drive  
a powered wheelchair or scooter through the rear or side entrance  
of a vehicle. An unobstructed 1.2 m access zone \(minimum\) should  
be provided to the side and rear of a standard bay \(2.4 m wide by  
4.8 m long\). Access to the rear of a vehicle by ramp also requires  
extra space. The provision of a larger designated accessible parking  
space 4.8 m wide by 8 m long benefits people using hoists or ramps  
to access their vehicles, and caters for larger commercial vehicles  
converted for side or rear access using hoists or ramps. In cov-  
ered parking, allowance should be made for high top conversion  
vehicles and vehicles with roof mounted hoists, with a minimum  
clearance of 2.6 m.  
The number of recommended designated bays should be cal-  
culated on the basis of the Table VI, which indicates minimum  
provision and allows for future flexibility if required. The table  
sets out a minimum percentage of bays but also suggests a flexible  
approach to future provision should demand dictate it. **4-10 Inclusive and accessible design**  
# Table VI Provision of accessible car parking bays  
# Provision from the outset Future provision  
# Number of spaces for Number of spaces  
# each employee who is a for visiting disabled  
# Building type disabled motorist motorists Number of enlarged standard spaces  
Workplaces One space 5% of the total capacity A further 5% of the total capacity  
Shopping, recreation and leisure facilities One space 6% of the total capacity A further 4% of the total capacity  
Railway buildings One space 5% of the total capacity A further 5% of the total capacity

Sports facilities Determined according to the usage of the sports facility \(detailed guidance is provided by Sport England, which  
identifies larger capacities are required for facilities catering for certain types of wheelchair-user sports\)  
Location, in addition to size, is critical – bays for disabled per-  
sons should be located as close as possible to the building entrance.  
If further than 50 m, then suitable seating/resting points should be  
provided.  
Even if parking is provided, suitable drop-off facilities should  
also be available as close to the building entrance as possible.  
# 4.7 Inclusive cycling  
An inclusive approach to cycling should accommodate a wide  
range of cycle types and not exclude or disadvantage their riders.  
This includes people with physical, sensory and cognitive impair-  
ments who use handcycles, tricycles \(both upright and recumbent\),  
tandems, solo bikes with or without adaptations to suit the rider’s  
specific needs \(e.g. one-handed brakes, crutch holders and power  
assisted\) and cargo bikes and bikes with trailers used by parents  
with children.  
Cycle infrastructure, such as cycle parking, should accommo-  
date all-ability cycles with cycle parking within buildings accessed  
by step-free routes. Transport for London recommends that at least  
5 per cent of parking spaces should cater for non-standard cycles  
\(using Sheffield style stands rather than stackers\) and that if lift  
access is provided to cycle stores then the lift should have a min-  
imum car size of 1.2 m wide by 2.3 m deep with a 900 mm door  
opening.  
# 4.8 Faith and cultural provision  
Building Regulations do not provide design guidance or consid-  
erations for the different faiths and cultures of building users, and  
there is limited guidance within British Standards. As discussed  
previously, although the Equality Act covers faith, it does not  
specifically require the design of the built environment to con-  
sider faith.  
From an inclusive design perspective, it is important to consider  
this as part of the analysis and response to user need. Depending  
on the nature of the building, the local population and the build-  
ing’s users will dictate how the design should accommodate  
differing faiths. Large-scale shopping facilities, transport hubs,  
civic buildings and educational establishments are likely to have  
large culturally diverse populations and, as such, are likely to have  
a defined need for such facilities. In developing the building brief  
designers should be cognisant of the need to address faith and cul-  
ture within the overall spatial requirements of the building; see  
Figure 4.12.  
Chapter 31 identifies key considerations for places of worship  
and identifies design features, notably for sanitary facilities, that  
should be considered for certain faiths. Where multi-faith rooms  
are provided, they should be provided with adjacent wash \(ablu-  
tion\) facilities and storage facilities.  
**4.12** *The London Legacy Development Corporation’s Inclusive Design Standards address the need to consider the needs of different*  
*faiths and cultures within the design of public buildings and housing. Photo © LLDC* **4.9 Emergency egress**  
Evacuation for disabled people is a combination of physical and  
management procedures plus a liaison between the building man-  
agers and occupants. The evacuation strategy for disabled people  
must include those with sensory and cognitive disabilities and  
should be developed in conjunction with the fire strategy and  
management policies, with reference made to good practice rec-  
ommendations within the BS 9999\:2017 *Code of practice for fire*  
*safety in the design, management and use of buildings*.  
All building users should be able to evacuate from a building  
with dignity and by as independent means as possible. Emergency  
carry up/down devices that rely on manual handling are not con-  
sidered to be appropriate for reasons of dignity and independence.  
The installation of lifts which can be used for evacuation purposes  
provide a dignified and more independent solution and are there-  
fore recommended.  
BS 9999 indicates that the preferred method of evacuation for  
disabled people is by horizontal evacuation to the outside of the  
building, or another fire compartment, or by evacuation lift. If these  
are not available or not in operation, then it might be necessary to  
implement ‘carry up’ or ‘carry down’. This approach has been cod-  
ified in the London Plan Policies *Inclusive Design* and *Fire Safety*.  
These require that in all developments where lifts are installed, as  
a minimum at least one lift per core \(or more subject to capacity  
assessments\) should be a suitably sized fire evacuation lift suitable  
to be used to evacuate people who require level access from the  
building.  
In addition, BS 9999 indicates\:  
• All refuge areas should be fitted with a means of two-way  
communication between the person waiting in the refuge and  
a central, monitored location from where evacuation assistance  
will be coordinated \(note the communication system should be  
accessible to people who are blind and partially sighted as well  
as people who are deaf, deafened or hard of hearing\).  
• Where refuges are provided, the scale of provision should repre-  
sent the expected users of the building and as such more than one  
space per escape core may be required.  
• If appropriately managed, the lobbies may permit more than one  
disabled person to wait safely for assistance, although only one  
official refuge space is indicated.  
• Management strategies can also be set in place to provide  
assisted escape via the steps if required.  
• Staff may need to be suitably trained in evacuation features and  
procedures including ‘carry up’ and ‘carry down’ procedures for  
evacuation of wheelchair users and other disabled people.  
• A Personal Emergency Egress Plan \(PEEP\) should be developed  
by disabled staff members in liaison with their employers.  
# 5 SANITARY FACILITIES  
# 5.1 Introduction  
Chapter 2 People and space addresses many of the key elements  
that need to be considered in the provision of suitable sanitary  
accommodation. There are further considerations that need to be  
factored into an inclusive design approach.  
# 5.2 Public toilets  
The provision of public toilets allows many people to spend more  
time in an area, to dwell and linger and enjoy the space. Toilets  
are not just important for families with small children, for preg-  
nant women, some disabled people and for older people, but for the  
seven million people in the UK who have an over-active bladder.  
# 5.3 Separate sex provision  
Without adequate toilets, many people, especially disabled people,  
are limited in their ability to go out to work, to shop and so forth.  
# Inclusive and accessible design 4-11  
The majority of disabled people do not require the use of unisex  
wheelchair accessible toilets.  
It is important that all toilet facilities are accessible, catering  
for a wide range of people, including older people and children.  
Therefore, elements such as door opening pressures, range of  
heights of sinks and urinals, visual contrast, easy to use door fur-  
niture and tap design are key design factors in making all toilets  
useable.  
The NHS estimates that between 3 and 6 million people in the  
UK have some degree of urinary incontinence. Up to 4 million peo-  
ple, mainly men, are affected by ‘shy bladder syndrome’ \(avoidant  
paruresis\) and therefore the layout of toilets should provide ‘line of  
sight’ privacy, an adequate number of cubicles and privacy screens.  
Another consideration is that women may need to use toilets  
more frequently than men and on average take longer than men  
\(this is particularly true during menstruation or during and after  
pregnancy\). The British Toilet Association recommends that twice  
the number of male cubicles plus number of male urinals is the  
appropriate number of cubicles for women.  
# 5.4 Faith  
Where WCs are provided, they should not be directly adjacent to  
prayer rooms.  
A proportion of WC pans and urinals should not align with  
Mecca. Quibla, the direction of the Kaaba \(the sacred building at  
Mecca\) to which Muslims turn and pray, should be established at  
the earliest RIBA work stage possible to assist with the setting out  
of sanitary facilities.  
# 5.5 Gender-neutral toilets  
There is no UK legislation that enshrines in law that non gendered  
toilets are to be provided. However, on private premises the man-  
ager or licensee has the right to determine entry to the premises and  
the right to decide who uses which toilet and any other gendered  
facilities such as changing rooms etc.  
Emerging good practice is to let people use the facilities appro-  
priate to the way they present and as those who have the protected  
characteristic of gender reassignment should not be discriminated  
against purely because they are transsexual. A proportionate solu-  
tion should be found. The Equality Act 2010 defines a person as  
having the protected characteristic of gender reassignment \(trans-  
sexualism\) if the person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or  
has undergone a process \(or part of a process\) for the purpose of  
reassigning the person’s sex by changing physiological or other  
attributes of sex.  
Consideration should be given to providing gender-neutral  
toilets that people of any gender or gender identity may use.  
Gender-neutral toilets should preferably be self-contained. Not  
all toilets should be defined as gender-neutral, as this may be  
problematic for certain faith groups who require separate sex  
facilities.  
Wheelchair accessible toilets are unisex; there is nothing that  
precludes them as being assigned as gender-neutral. However, this  
is not recommended in practice as this could make the accessible  
toilets less available to the disabled people that need them.  
# 5.6 Children’s toilets  
Children are often not considered in the design of toilets. Many  
children can be deterred from independent use of toilet facilities  
by poor design and specification. It should also be possible in  
developments that are likely to have many children using them,  
for example leisure facilities, to provide separate children’s toilets.  
These could be provided with associated family facilities, such as  
nappy-changing facilities. Nappy-changing facilities must never be  
situated in accessible toilets, except through exception as indicated  
in BS 8300. It is important that separate wheelchair accessible  
nappy-changing areas are provided. **4-12 Inclusive and accessible design**  
# 5.7 Changing Places facilities  
In larger developments, consideration should also be given to  
Changing Places \(CP\) toilets. Some people, including people  
with profound and multiple disabilities, need to be laid flat to be  
changed within WC accommodation. If CP toilets are not pro-  
vided, people may have to change a person on the floor. This is  
undignified, unhygienic and involves heavy lifting by others, such  
as carers or personal assistants, which could cause serious back  
injuries.  
CP facilities should be provided in buildings and locations  
where large numbers of people may visit, such as major enter-  
tainment venues, as well as places people may visit for several  
hours at a time. The requirement for CP toilets are statutory  
in Scotland under the Town and Country Planning \(Changing  
Places Toilet Facilities\) \(Scotland\) Regulations 2020. The trigger  
points for use-class application, occupancy and size differ from  
the amended requirements of the Approved Document M Vol  
2 Non-dwellings. As of January 2021, there were no statutory  
requirements for CP facilities in Northern Ireland or Wales. The  
Department for Transport also requires CP toilets are provided  
within all Category A railway stations \(stations with at least a  
2 million footfall each year\) when toilet facilities are installed,  
replaced or renewed.  
Based on recommendations by the CP Consortium and BS  
8300, CP toilets should be provided in\:  
• Major transport terminals or interchanges such as airports and  
large railway and bus stations  
• Motorway service stations  
• Sport and leisure facilities, including entertainment arenas, sta-  
dia, large hotels, large theatres and multiplex cinemas  
• Cultural centres such as museums, concert halls and art galleries  
• Shopping centres, large retail developments and Shopmobility  
centres  
• Key public buildings within town centres such as town halls,  
civic centres and principal public libraries  
• Educational establishments, including universities  
• Health facilities such as hospitals, health centres and doctors’  
surgeries  
• Crematoria and cemetery buildings.  
A CP toilet should be at least 3 m wide and 4 m long, and have  
a ceiling height of at least 2.4 m to accommodate the hoist. The  
entrance door should provide an effective clear width of 1000 mm.

6 Conclusion  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
This chapter examines the relationship between cost and value  
in construction projects, and discusses why architects should pay  
attention to their client’s budgetary constraints. We also describe  
the degree of risk which clients accept when undertaking construc-  
tion projects, and the steps which designers can take to mitigate  
these risks. In describing the estimating and cost planning process,  
we explain the discipline of the cost planning process, and the  
importance of the achievement of an appropriate level of fixity of  
design and specification at the conclusion of each RIBA project  
stage. We also describe the information that is available to cost  
consultants in preparing estimates at different project stages, and  
the degree of certainty that can be attached to these estimates.  
The expenditure on design and construction can have significant  
leverage relative to the costs of occupation. For example, appropri-  
ate investment in design and construction could potentially have a  
significant and valuable impact on the productivity of building occu-  
piers. With many buildings procured by the public sector on the basis  
of design, build and operate arrangements such as LIFT, which is  
used for primary healthcare, whole life costing is today of increas-  
ing importance. The sustainability agenda is of growing significance  
with the drive for net zero development and a rising consideration  
of circular economy principles, which is concerned with managing  
energy consumption, carbon emissions and other environmental  
impacts. As a result, opportunities to invest to save energy and to  
mitigate environmental impacts are taken increasingly seriously.  
# 2 CONSTRUCTION COSTS  
# 2.1 Cost planning  
Cost planning is a key due diligence step in preparing for a construc-  
tion project. Cost planning informs the client and the project team  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-6  
how much a proposed project is likely to cost. Additionally, cost  
planning will tell when the expected expenses will most likely occur\:  
a cash flow programme. This information is critical for obtaining  
project financing and for determining project affordability.  
Very few, if any, clients have the luxury of an unlimited budget,  
and even with generous funding, all clients will want to make sure  
that the proposed design solution represents the best way of meet-  
ing their purpose, and that their investment makes the best use of  
their resources. Financial discipline on a project does not mean  
that budgets must be unrealistically tight. However, it does mean  
that the client’s investment should be managed responsibly by the  
project team to focus on elements which relate specifically to the  
client’s value criteria. Typical value criteria influencing projects  
are discussed later.  
# 2.2 The value agenda  
For many buildings, particularly those constructed for commercial  
markets, the client’s principal measure of worth is the building’s  
exchange value, typically measured by rental or sales revenue.  
Exchange value is used by clients in investment appraisals to deter-  
mine whether projects are financially viable. In effect, exchange  
value determines the ‘bottom line’ of most schemes. Exchange  
value is generally defined by third parties and, particularly in com-  
mercial property markets, it is often difficult to secure a premium  
valuation for innovation. As a result, clients may have surprisingly  
little room for manoeuvre in setting their construction budgets.  
Exchange value issues can affect public sector projects too. Many  
public sector clients operate internal marketplaces where facilities  
are bought – using the volume of demand to establish the size and  
quality of the building that can be afforded.  
Value is of course not just about financial considerations and  
there are many other ways in which buildings are able to contribute  
benefits to their owners, occupiers and neighbours. Some of the  
sources of these are listed here\:  
• *Operational value*. The benefits generated through the occupa-  
tion and use of the building, which might include greater staff  
productivity, or improved educational outcomes associated with  
a new school.  
• *Social value*. The broader benefits to society of a development,  
which might include local residents feeling more secure in their  
neighbourhood following the completion of an urban realm  
improvement project.  
• *Brand/organisation value*. Messages communicated by a build-  
ing derived from its design, and which reflect positively on the  
occupier. For example, a flagship development designed to  
achieve exemplary standards of sustainability and environmen-  
tal performance.  
• *Civic/esteem value*. This is the contribution that a development  
can make to a neighbourhood in terms of physical improve-  
ment to the quality of the building fabric, public realm and so  
on. This benefit is secured by all users of the neighbourhood.  
The reflected prestige that neighbouring buildings can gain from  
proximity to a high-quality development, be it Tate Modern or  
a major redevelopment scheme such as Kings Cross Central in  
**5-1** **5-2 Capital and whole life costs of buildings**  
London, may reflect in an increase in the exchange value of the  
neighbouring buildings.  
Whilst not all sources of value have an immediate financial dimen-  
sion, all require a focused and disciplined approach by the design  
team to concentrate effort and investment on aspects of the design  
which maximise benefits to client, end users and the wider commu-  
nity, without compromising the fundamental financial viability of  
the project.  
# 2.3 Risk and value management  
Risk and value management should be carried out throughout a  
project lifecycle, with early involvement of the entire integrated  
project team to minimise/manage risks. Risk management ensures  
that risks are identified and analysed as early in the project life  
cycle as possible, and that their potential impacts are understood,  
allowed for and where possible minimised. The main emphasis is  
to ensure that they are effectively managed in order to minimise  
negative consequences and maximise opportunities.  
The project team create a risk register and assign a red, amber  
or green ‘traffic light’ system to each risk \(Table I\). Obviously red  
risks need actioning immediately. Rigorous follow up of identified  
risk mitigation actions and regular updates of the risk register are  
essential if the full benefits of risk management are to be realised

**5.1** *Risk management circle*  
High impact and high probability risks will need addressing  
immediately and the project team needs to ensure that the risk is  
owned by someone in the team – which could be the client. All  
need to agree what measures are required to ensure a successful  
outcome. Value management is about adding or enhancing value  
and not solely about cutting cost, although this may be a by-prod-  
uct. The principles and techniques of value management aim to  
provide the required quality at optimum whole life cost during the  
process of developing a project.  
# 3 PROCUREMENT  
# 3.1 Strategy  
Selection of the procurement strategy and contract selection is  
one of the most important decisions facing the client. It has been  
estimated that the optimum strategy can influence the overall  
project cost by between 10–15%.  
\(Treasury guidance to Government Departments\)  
The primary consideration in the procurement of construction pro-  
jects is the need to obtain best value for money in the whole life  
of the service or facility. The design and operation of the facility  
should maximise the delivery of effective services. This is most  
likely to be achieved through integration of the design, construc-  
tion, operation and ongoing maintenance. Some compromises will  
almost certainly have to be made to achieve an optimum balance of  
risk, benefit and funding for a project.  
# 3.2 Influencing factors  
• Project objectives – for example, to provide office space for 1000  
people to deliver the client services  
• Constraints – such as budget and funding and the timeframe in  
which the project has to be delivered  
• Cultural factors – such as considerations about the workspace  
environment that will best support the way people work  
• Risks – such as late completion of the facility; innovative use of  
materials; carbon reduction strategies  
• The client’s capabilities to manage a project of this type  
• The length of operational service required from the facility.  
# 3.3 Procurement routes and associated risk  
Critical issues\:  
• Relationship between design and construction  
• Allocation of design risk \(time, cost, quality\)  
• Allocation of construction risk \(time, cost, quality\)  
• Status of design at point of committing to construction  
• Incidence of change  
• The project brief.  
# 3.4 Design and build  
• Design team employed by client to develop brief  
• Project design progressed to suitable stage prior to tender  
• Employer’s requirements issued to main contractors who submit  
their contractor’s proposals, lump sum tender and agreed programme  
• Main contractor has an obligation to deliver the project as  
defined within the contractor’s proposals to the cost and pro-  
gramme agreed within the returned tender  
• Contractor retains responsibility for the design and design devel-  
opment.  
# 3.5 Traditional lump sum  
• Design team employed by client to develop brief  
• Project design completed prior to tender  
• Main contractor submits a lump sum tender and agreed pro-  
gramme  
• Main contractor has responsibility to deliver the project as speci-  
fied to the cost and programme agreed at tender stage  
• Client retains responsibility of sufficiency of design.  
# 3.6 Construction management  
• Fundamentally different approach to the two previous routes –  
no main contractor is appointed.  
• The brief is developed by a design team appointed by the client  
who are responsible for developing the design.  
• A construction manager is appointed by the client as a  
fee-earning consultant to programme, coordinate and manage  
the design and construction activities executed by the trade  
contractors.  
• Trade contractors are employed directly by the client. Figure 5.2 looks at financial risk and who owns it for the most  
common procurement options. Management of risk is an ongoing  
process throughout the life of the project, as risks will be con-  
stantly changing. Risk management plans should be in place to  
deal quickly and effectively with risks if they arise. It is important  
to work as an integrated project team from the earliest possible  
stages on an open book basis to identify risks throughout the  
team’s supply chains.  
**5.2** *Procurement routes*  
**5.3** *Relationship between programme and change*  
# 3.7 Design stages  
As a client’s brief and concept designs are developed, a greater  
degree of fixity in terms of the design solution and predicted costs  
can be provided by the project team. This process is discussed in  
more detail in the section focused on cost planning. However, as  
the design develops and cost certainty increases, so does the cost  
of changing the design, and the client and project team’s resistance  
to change. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 5.3 and empha-  
sises why it is so important to stick to the discipline of progressive  
sign-off at the end of each design stage.  
As a project progresses to the appointment of contractors, the  
client’s overall financial commitment becomes better defined.  
More risk can also be transferred to third parties if the client  
so wishes. Whilst under most procurement routes the client is  
required to accept risks associated with design performance,  
they will generally seek to transfer commercial and construc-  
tion risks to the contractor through some form of a fixed-price,  
lump sum contract. Quite clearly, if the design information upon  
which the client obtains a contractual commitment is not com-  
plete, is ambiguous or is not fully coordinated then, not only  
will the client retain outstanding design risk, but will also find  
that the basis of his commercial risk transfer to the contractor  
is weakened.  
Evidence from Construction Key Performance Indicators,  
published by Constructing Excellence, indicates the scale of this  
potential problem, showing that fewer than 80 per cent of projects  
are completed with +/−10 per cent of their original tender sum.  
# Capital and whole life costs of buildings 5-3  
Moreover, only around 50 per cent of projects are completed within  
+/−5 per cent of the tender sum. Whilst some of this cost variation  
may reflect client changes, or problems on site, it is likely that some  
of these increases will have resulted from the consequences of con-  
tinuing design development.  
In order to mitigate the client’s risk, it is incumbent upon the  
team to ensure that the design is completed to the appropriate  
level of detail and fixity required by the procurement route. To do  
otherwise risks rendering some of the effort expended in design  
development and cost planning abortive.  
# 3.8 Order of cost estimating and elemental cost planning  
It is often said that the first cost received by the client is the cost  
that is always remembered, so it is important that the entire project  
team clearly understand each other’s requirements and that esti-  
mates submitted to the client include all relevant heads of cost.  
# 4 NEW RULES OF MEASUREMENT AND  
# COST ESTIMATING  
# 4.1 Rules  
In May 2009 the New Rules of Measurement \(NRM\) order of  
cost estimating and elemental cost planning were introduced by  
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The NRM have  
been written to provide a standard set of measurement rules that  
are understandable by all those involved in a construction project,  
including the employer, thereby aiding communication between  
the project/design team and the employer. In addition, the NRM  
should assist the quantity surveyor/cost manager in providing  
effective and accurate cost advice to the employer and the rest of  
the project/design team.  
# 4.2 Order of cost estimate  
The purpose of an *order of cost estimate* is to establish if the pro-  
posed building project is affordable and, if affordable, to establish  
a realistic *cost limit* for the building project. The *cost limit* is the  
maximum expenditure that the *employer* is prepared to make in  
relation to the completed building project, which will be managed  
by the project team \(i.e. authorised budget\).  
Order of cost estimates are produced as an intrinsic part of  
RIBA Work Stages 0\: Strategic Definition and 1\: Preparation and  
Briefing, or OGC Gateways 0 Strategic Assessment, 1 \(Business  
Justification\) and 2 \(Delivery Strategy\). There are comprehensive  
guidelines within the NRM and readers are recommended to read  
the relevant sections of the NRM where more detailed explanations  
and examples can be found.  
In the UK, cost plans are typically organised into ‘building ele-  
ments’. Consistently defined elements, such as substructure, frame,  
external walls, are widely used by cost consultants when preparing  
cost plans. They enable the costs of buildings or individual ele-  
ments to be benchmarked with data from other similar schemes.  
As the design becomes increasingly detailed, budgets are set for  
each element providing further discipline for the project team as  
the design develops. According to client preference, and depending  
upon the procurement route adopted, some estimates may also be  
organised in accordance with trade-based packages. The definition  
of the content of packages varies from project to project. For pro-  
jects procured either on the basis of construction management or  
two-stage tenders, estimates prepared in a packages format provide  
a direct link between the documentation necessary to procure the  
package, and the management of its costs.  
At this early stage for the estimate to be representative of the  
proposed design solution, the key variables that a designer needs to  
have developed to an appropriate degree of certainty are\:  
• The floor areas upon which the estimate is based  
• Proposed elevations  
• The implied level of specification. **5-4 Capital and whole life costs of buildings**

Note\: The building costs set out in Table II should be applied to the gross internal floor  
area \(gifa\) of a building. The rates are current at first quarter 2021 based on an Outer  
London location, unless stated otherwise, they include preliminaries and contractor’s  
overheads and profit but do not include demolitions, external works and services, loose  
furniture and equipment or specialist installations. Professional fees and VAT are also  
excluded.

Table II sets out feasibility cost information for a range of building  
types, illustrating the range of costs that can relate to a particular  
building function.  
The variation in costs illustrated in Table II is driven by a wide  
range of factors and they are not minimum and maximum costs.  
They only give an indication of typical costs which can be expected.  
The scope of sources of additional costs which are not related to  
the floor areas of the building includes external works, fittings and  
furniture and loose equipment.  
Rates will need to be updated to the estimate date by the  
amount of inflation occurring from the base date of the cost  
data to the current estimate date. The percentage addition can  
be calculated using published indices \(i.e. tender price indices  
\(TPI\)\) or derived from in-house sources of indices. In addi-  
tion, consideration should be given to the project location – the  
project cost should be adjusted accordingly using published  
location factors.  
Main contractor’s preliminaries, overheads and profit need to be  
added to the cost of building works. Generally, this is a percentage  
addition ascertained from previous benchmarked studies.  
The accuracy associated with feasibility estimates of this nature  
is probably no better than +/−20–25 per cent. However, most cli-  
ents require a single point estimate, even at the earliest stage of a  
project, and the architect and cost consultant must agree an appro-  
priate allowance for design development and other unknowns,  
balancing requirements for early cost certainty alongside the need  
for competitive, value for money solutions appropriate to the cli-  
ent’s needs.  
# 4.3 RICS Property Measurement  
Introduced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\),  
the RICS Property Measurement replaces the Code of Measuring  
Practice and incorporates the International Property Measurement  
Standards \(IPMS\) for Offices, Retail Buildings, Industrial Buildings  
and Residential Buildings. The Code of Measuring Practice 6th  
Edition remains in effect for all other building types.  
RICS Property Measurement incorporates several key changes  
from the Code of Measuring Practice for office buildings\:  
• Gross External Area \(GEA\), Gross Internal Area \(GIA\) or Net  
Internal Area \(NIA\) are no longer used. This terminology has  
been replaced with IPMS 1, IPMS 2 and IPMS 3. Whilst these  
are not direct replacements, they can be closely related to GEA,  
GIA and NIA respectively.  
• IPMS 1 includes the area of the building incorporating the exter-  
nal walls. The key differences between IPMS 1 and GEA are the  
inclusion of balconies under IPMS 1. However, covered galler-  
ies and balconies are stated separately.  
• IPMS 2 is measured to the internal dominant face. The inter-  
nal dominant face is defined as the ‘surface comprising more  
than 50% of the surface area for each vertical section forming an  
internal perimeter’. So, for example, for an office building with  
unitised cladding, this would mean the glass surface. Balconies  
and covered canopies would be stated separately.  
• IPMS 3 includes area taken by columns, piers/external col-  
umns and window reveals. All of these are excluded under NIA.  
Additionally, space taken by balconies, covered galleries, roof  
terraces are all included but stated separately. Lift lobbies and  
area with headroom of less than 1.5 metres are also included but  
stated separately as limited use area.  
• IPMS 1, IPMS 2 and IPMS 3 need to be measured and stated  
separately. To ensure transparency, marked up plans should  
accompany measurement reports, which should be detailed to  
include the breakdown of the measure; this should provide ben-  
efit to the end user.  
• Introduction of the concept of limited use area. This includes  
areas with limited height \(less than 1.5 metres\), areas with  
limited natural light, internal structural walls/columns, area  
difference between internal dominant face and the wall/floor  
junction. Whilst these areas are included in the measurement,  
they must also be stated separately.  
It will take the wider market some time to embrace IPMS, espe-  
cially with the impact on end user market for valuation purposes,  
as it will have a direct impact on their comparable databases. There  
will be a period where the existing GEA, GIA and NIA will remain  
in favour.  
# 4.4 Wall to floor ratio  
One common measure of efficiency is the wall to floor ratio for  
the building. The wall to floor ratio of a building is calculated by  
dividing the external wall area by the gross internal floor area. This  
indicates the proportion of external wall required to enclose a given  
floor area Figure 5.4 shows the ratio can affect the cost of a tall  
office tower.  
If you simply pick an average price from the rate range in  
Table II, then it may not reflect the true building complexity. A  
wall to floor ratio of 0.45 is a relatively simple box. The addition  
**5.4** *Example of a wall to floor ratio. \(Source\: AECOM\)* **5.5** *Formal cost planning stages*  
of recesses, returns, increased floor-to-floor heights to that box can  
add a significant cost to the building. This is particularly relevant  
in tall towers, where the external façade represents a significant  
proportion of the overall building cost.  
# 4.5 Formal cost planning stages  
The NRM schedules several formal cost planning stages  
\(Figure 5.5\), which are comparable with the RIBA Design and Pre-  
Construction Work Stages and OGC Gateways 3A \(Design Brief  
and Concept Approval\) and 3B \(Detailed Design Approval\) for a  
building project. The employer is required to ‘approve’ the cost  
plan on completion of each RIBA Work Stage before authorising  
commencement of the next RIBA Work Stage.  
Formal Cost Plan 1 is prepared at a point where the scope of  
work is fully defined, and key criteria are specified but no detailed  
design has begun. Formal Cost Plan 1 will provide the frame of  
reference for Formal Cost Plan 2. Likewise, Formal Cost Plan  
2 will provide the frame of reference for Formal Cost Plan 3.  
Neither Formal Cost Plans 2 or 3 involve the preparation of a  
completely new elemental cost plan. Instead, they are progres-  
sions of the previous cost plans, which are developed through the  
cost checking of price significant components and cost targets as  
more design information and further information about the site  
becomes available.  
The cost targets within each Formal Cost Plan approved by the  
employer will be used as the baseline for future cost comparisons.  
Each subsequent cost plan will require reconciliation, with the  
preceding cost plan and explanations relating to changes made. In  
view of this, it is essential that records of any transfers made to, or  
from, the risk allowances and any adjustments made to cost targets  
be maintained, so that explanations concerning changes can be pro-  
vided to both the employer and the project team.  
Cost consultants recognise that the design process is not lin-  
ear, and in many instances, the cost plan will include allowances  
based upon informed assumptions as to what the designer’s even-  
tual solution will be. Working together effectively, an architect and  
# Capital and whole life costs of buildings 5-5  
cost consultant can ensure that the cost plan provides appropriate  
allowances for the realisation of the design, whilst at the same  
time delivering a cost effective and functional solution. Where  
the designer does not engage actively in the cost planning pro-  
cess, there is a risk that a cost consultant will make inappropriate  
allowances for incomplete work, potentially creating unnecessary  
constraints for future design development.  
Table III sets out examples of cost planning rates used in a typ-  
ical stage 3 plan. The rates are presented as a range to account for  
variations in specification, quantity and working method. A higher  
rate might apply for discontinuous work for example. In the cost  
plan itself, a single rate will be used, which the cost manager feels  
reflects the complexity and specification of the project.  
Cost planning items at this stage are headline descriptions of  
the work and their selection and pricing should follow the prin-  
ciples of the *pareto rule*, where 80 per cent of the value of the  
work is captured by 20 per cent of the measurable items. Cost  
planning rates such as these include all costs associated with  
materials, labour, interfaces and detailing, together with specialist  
contractors and main contractor’s overheads and profit. Many of  
these rates are obtained by ‘market testing’ with indicative costs  
obtained from contractors. Architects sometimes undertake ele-  
ments of market testing themselves. If an architect does undertake  
such market testing exercises, then in presenting the results to the  
design team and client they should ensure that all costs necessary  
to complete the work have been included, and proper allowance  
has been made for the cost implications of the procurement route  
adopted.  
At stage 3, the cost plan is intended to provide a greater degree  
of accuracy. For this to be achieved, the design needs to have  
reached a corresponding degree of certainty and detail so that quan-  
tities can be relied upon, sources of complexity recognised and the  
cost implications of the proposed specification can be properly  
assessed.  
In preparing cost plans, cost consultants obtain information  
from a wide range of sources which will include\:  
• Prices of similar work undertaken on previously completed  
projects  
• Quotations obtained from suppliers and specialist contractors  
• Cost information published by third parties, including price  
books, journal articles and so on.  
In order to normalise this diverse range of information for loca-  
tion, price inflation and so forth, cost consultants apply a range  
of adjustment factors derived from the statistical analysis of large  
project data-sets, undertaken by bodies such as the Building Cost  
Information Service \(BCIS\) or large practices who have their own  
in-house research teams.

professional fees and VAT are excluded.  
Source\: *Spon’s Architects’ and Builders’ Price Book, 2021*, Taylor & Francis **5-6 Capital and whole life costs of buildings**  
When presenting estimates to the client, the cost consultant and  
design team make some important decisions about costs that are  
included and excluded from an estimate. Heads of costs which are  
typically excluded from a cost plan, but might need to be reinstated  
or included elsewhere in the client’s budget, include\:  
• Site acquisition costs  
• Professional and statutory fees  
• Furniture, fittings and equipment  
• Costs related to planning agreements \(sections 106 and 278\)  
• Contributions to major infrastructure projects  
• The client’s own project management, finance and insurance  
costs  
• Overall project contingencies  
• Value Added Tax  
• Local authority and statutory authority charges for road clo-  
sures etc.  
• Costs of services diversions and off-site services reinforcement.  
Clearly, the list of exclusions for any particular project could be  
very extensive. The intention of presenting them in the cost plan is  
to make it clear that the client may potentially be exposed to these  
additional costs, and that allowances have to be made somewhere  
within the overall project budget.  
The cost plan is generally submitted as part of the RIBA stage  
design report. It is a detailed document, which requires a considera-  
ble amount of time and effort to prepare. It also provides a valuable  
resource for the project team to monitor the development of the  
design. In order for it to be an effective control document, the cost  
plan must provide an accurate reflection of the quantum and spec-  
ification of the design at the conclusion of the design stage. This  
means that whilst designers can continue to develop detailed design  
solutions ahead of the completion of a stage, they should freeze  
the key parameters of their design sufficiently early for the cost  
plan to be produced with some certainty. Whilst technology such  
as CAD-based measurement has sped up the production process,  
proper allowance still has to be made in the programme for the  
compilation of the cost plan based on relatively firm information.  
Other considerations which may be made at this time include\:  
• Capital allowances for provision of tax relief on items such as  
plant and machinery, industrial building allowance, hotel build-  
ing allowance  
• Land remediation allowances  
• Grants.  
It is recommended that specialist advice be sought to maximise the  
availability and magnitude of capital allowances.  
# 4.6 Option studies  
Throughout the design process, architects and engineers need to  
examine alternative design solutions, be it structural options, dif-  
ferent air conditioning systems or alternative floor finishes. The  
cost consultant can contribute to the selection of preferred solution  
through the preparation of an option study, taking into account the  
full cost implications of each choice, which might include effects  
on the costs of other building elements, overall project duration  
and so on. Increasingly, option studies are prepared on the basis of  
whole life costs, taking into account the operational dimensions of  
specification as well as short-term considerations based on capital  
cost, programme and procurement.  
# 4.7 Cost checking  
Once the Formal Cost Plan 3 is agreed, and the client approves  
substantial investment in the preparation of production infor-  
mation, then the focus of the cost consultant should shift from  
projecting what the cost of the scheme should be, to ensuring that  
the design, as it develops, remains within the set budget. In these  
circumstances, the cost consultant will produce detailed estimates  
of specific elements or trade packages, which will confirm whether  
or not the architect’s scheme can be delivered within the disciplines  
of allowances stated in the cost plan.  
# 5 WHOLE LIFE COSTS  
# 5.1 Lifetime  
Buildings tend to be long-lived assets, and often have considera-  
ble operational costs, related to heating, ventilation and lighting,  
repair, maintenance and so on. Research undertaken by CeBe  
\(Constructing Excellence in the Built Environment\) identified that  
the cost of maintenance over a building’s lifetime can equate to  
many times the original construction cost. Furthermore, the costs  
of the operation, including the salaries of occupants, can equate to  
many times more than this.  
What these findings illustrate is that the lifetime costs of running  
and occupying a building will in almost all projects far outweigh  
the initial design and build costs. Therefore, if the design can be  
challenged to reduce operating costs or enhance staff productiv-  
ity, the client may agree to invest additional capital costs to fund  
these improvements. More recently, this lifetime focus has been  
extended to consideration of sustainable and net zero carbon devel-  
opments, both of which have operational cost implications and are  
forming a greater part of whole life assessments. Most notably,  
benefits to utilities usage are being considered in the lifetime cost/  
performance calculations, as additional investment can provide  
financial benefit over the operational life, and inform payback and  
return on investment reviews.  
With the sustainability agenda very high up on many clients’  
agendas, designers can be expected in the future to demonstrate a  
greater appreciation of long-term performance issues of their build-  
ing designs. With the advent of the Government Soft Landings  
Building Information Modelling \(BIM\) strategy, the ongoing drive  
for sustainable development and energy efficiency, and the increas-  
ing requirement for BIM enabled delivery, these operational issues  
and costs are becoming an integral part of the standard design  
assessment.  
It is important to clarify the distinction between life cycle costs  
and life cycle analysis \(LCA\). The former is concerned with cal-  
culating the costs associated with the operation and occupation of  
an asset, and is the subject of this chapter. By contrast, LCA is  
concerned with the full range of environmental impacts of a build-  
ing, covering embodied impacts, construction and operational  
effects, together with those associated with asset disposal. As well  
as greenhouse gases, the scope of LCA will include impacts on  
landfill, water, biodiversity and so on. Where these assessments  
can demonstrate financial implication/benefit, they can be included  
in the whole life cost assessment.  
The whole life cost agenda is potentially a very powerful tool  
for designers to create the case for investment in a design which  
promotes greater productivity, flexibility, durability or operational  
life. However, as with all forms of analysis, the whole life cost  
assessment needs to be prepared in a way which meets the client’s  
objectives, and which provides an accurate representation of future  
performance. The problems affecting the take-up of whole life cost  
analysis still include difficulties in obtaining unambiguous and cor-  
roborated performance and durability data, and convincing clients  
of the long-term benefits to be gained from a more rigorous early  
assessment. The increasing desire, and in some cases requirement,  
for Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment  
Method \(BREEAM\) and other sustainable assessment ratings is  
however driving an interest in whole life costing, as it forms a part  
of the available credits for these ratings. These trends, together  
with the increasing drive for sustainable, net zero carbon and circu-  
lar economy solutions, are pushing lifetime financial evaluation to  
the forefront of many projects. **5.2 Considerations**  
Without getting into the detail of the production of whole life cost  
estimates, architects should be aware of the purpose of the assess-  
ment. Whole life cost studies are typically produced for three  
purposes\:  
• An estimate of the operational cost of an asset. In this instance,  
the whole life cost study should cover all potential sources of cost  
associated with the occupation of a building. These cost centres  
might include energy, cleaning, insurances, maintenance and so  
on. Total operating cost assessments such as these are typically  
used by clients to confirm that they will be able to afford to run  
and maintain their assets.  
• Capital asset replacement. These whole life costs studies focus  
solely on modelling the operational life of durable assets such as  
mechanical systems; roof finishes etc., that require replacement  
during the life of the building. These enable the client to plan for  
long-term maintenance obligations.  
• Option comparisons. Option studies can be prepared to identify  
preferred options on the basis of long-term performance. The  
approach could be used to select alternatives that have either  
different energy use, maintenance or replacement profiles such  
as window systems, floor finishes, air conditioning options.  
In an extreme case, the choice between a leased building and  
a self-financed scheme could be supported. Option studies  
involve the comparison of alternatives which might have dif-  
ferent life spans, replacement cycles, income or expenditure  
profiles. As a result, in many instances comparison can only be  
undertaken using discounted cash flow techniques. The use of  
discounting enables cash flows which occur in different time  
frames to be totalled and compared on a like-for-like basis,  
enabling a best value option to be selected on the basis of net  
present cost/value.  
# 5.3 Life cycle factors  
When reviewing the results of option studies based on life cycle  
cost methodologies, the architect should ensure that the following  
aspects of the study have been properly taken into account\:  
# Capital and whole life costs of buildings 5-7  
• *Discount rate –* this should take into account the client’s  
requirements. In the case of the public sector, discount rates are  
published by the Treasury, and in the private sector, discount  
rates generally reflect the client’s cost of finance or expecta-  
tions for rates of return. As it can have such an impact on the  
end result, the discount rate must always be confirmed by the  
client.  
• *Consistency* – costs for all options must be consistently cal-  
culated. Where appropriate, both cost and income streams  
associated with each option should be considered. Where one  
option can deliver an enhanced benefit \(for example a reduc-  
tion in energy usage\) this can be included in the assessment to  
offset the cost of maintenance and disposal. For example, all  
cleaning and maintenance costs should be included in a floor  
finishes assessment, together with energy reduction or opera-  
tional maintenance benefits, as well as any revenues associated  
with the disposal of high value, long-life assets such as natural  
finishes.  
• *Presentation* – a whole life cost study based on discounted cash  
flow should make it clear that the reported cost does not reflect  
what the client or end user will actually pay. Furthermore, if the  
net present cost differential between two or more options is rel-  
atively small, the team should ensure that other criteria, such as  
the initial capital expenditure, are considered in the selection of  
the preferred option.  
• *Accuracy* – the report should clearly state how accurate and reli-  
able the source information upon which it is based is.  
Table IV shows a simple worked example of a whole life cost  
based option study examining the capital and maintenance costs  
of softwood and aluminium windows over an extended period of  
50 years. The comparison illustrates that the initially more costly  
aluminium windows, could have a lower lifetime cost.  
Features of the example that are worth noting include\:  
• *Total cost* – this example is based on a discounted cash flow and  
the results are presented as a ‘net present cost’. This is the cost of  
all expenditure over the 50-year period, discounted to the present  
day at a rate of 8 per cent per annum.

• *Effects of discounting* – the costs of all future work are dis-  
counted to comparison on a like-for-like basis. This has the  
effect of reducing the significance and cost of future expend-  
iture. The higher the discount rate, the lower the value of  
future expenditure. On this basis, high discount rates favour  
projects with lower initial capital costs. The effects of the  
discount factor can be seen in the declining cost of repair  
and maintenance over the study period. Even by year 5, at  
a discount rate of 8 per cent, the present day cost of £300 is  
discounted to £204.  
• *Inclusion of relevant costs only* – other operational costs that  
would be the same for the two options, cleaning for example,  
can be excluded from the study as long as these assumptions are  
stated and the comparisons normalised.  
• *Length of the study period* – in the worked example, the  
requirement to replace timber windows at 30 years is the key  
driver behind the differences in net present cost. If the duration  
of the study were limited to 25 years, painted softwood would  
emerge the preferred option. Consideration of this ‘real world’  
context should be taken into account when reviewing the out-  
turn numbers.  
# 6 CONCLUSION  
Clients will judge the success of their capital projects by many criteria,  
and there is no doubt that the imagination shown by the design team  
in delivering a carefully targeted solution to their client’s require-  
ments, together with a commitment to achieving a good level of  
finished quality, will be very high on most clients’ agendas. Delivery  
on budget is also usually a high priority, and unlike other aspects of  
project delivery, this is easy to monitor and measure. Design teams  
need to work closely with their cost consultants to make sure that  
budgets are appropriate, and that design solutions directly address the  
aspects of the client’s brief which deliver greatest value.  
Techniques such as whole life costing and value management can  
be used by the cost consultant and wider design/project team to help  
to identify design solutions which best meet the client’s requirements.  
By collaborating closely from the earlier stages of a project to  
establish an appropriate capital cost budget, and by maintaining  
the discipline of working within the budget set by the client and  
project team, the design team will give itself the best opportunity  
of delivering a project which meets the design team’s expectations,  
the client’s requirements and provides all parties with an appropri-  
ate financial reward. **ESSENTIALS** **6 Structure**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Scope  
Structural engineering ensures that the loads of the building and  
its contents are transmitted safely and economically to the ground,  
allowing for considerations of function, aesthetics, internal and  
external environment and incorporating restraints imposed by other  
members of the building team, legislation, and so forth.  
Structural engineering requires the use of mathematics to  
determine the forces in the framing elements of a structure \(struc-  
tural analysis\). Sizing of these elements is then carried out based  
on interpretation of guidance provided in Codes of Practice rele-  
vant to the material being used \(structural design\). A competent  
structural engineer will have suitable training and be experienced  
in the required analysis and design techniques. Innovative and  
non-standard structures may require special consideration with the  
use of model testing to confirm analytical assumptions and mem-  
ber sizing.  
# 1.2 Complexity  
In recent years, mathematical methods prescribed in new Codes of  
Practice have become more complex, making the use of computer  
programs essential.  
Although architects use computers widely in practice, it is  
debatable how much the computer is used to design. While more  
technically advanced architectural design does use the computer  
to design, and many contemporary buildings would not be real-  
ised without it, more often than not, the computer screen is a  
drawing board and the mouse a 2B pencil. To the sole practitioner  
or small practice, the choice of how much technology is needed is  
based on their interpretation of the advantages and disadvantages  
involved.  
In the world of the structural engineer, the use of the computer  
is more fundamental for its inherent ability to calculate the complex  
loading patterns and stresses, and so forth, required for designing  
the appropriate structure. However, it is the understanding of prin-  
ciples and the ability to develop a strategy that allows the relevant  
data to be entered into the computing system to begin with.  
Students of architecture are usually taught the principles of struc-  
tural design, and that knowledge is very useful in discussions with a  
structural engineer about a project. However, it is unlikely that either  
student or practitioner will need to deal with numbers, and if they  
did, they certainly would need to use computers to calculate anything.  
# 1.3 Philosophy  
The treatment of the subject in this chapter is necessarily brief. It  
will be even less comprehensive than in previous editions but will  
still try to give the architect something of a feel for structure, and  
help them in discussions with a structural engineer. And this is the  
key. An understanding of the numbers involved is not as important  
as an appreciation of the structural ‘philosophy’ and principles. A  
grasp of how the structure is ‘working’ will enable the architect  
to have a meaningful conversation with a structural engineer. It  
should always be remembered that structure will have a defina-  
ble impact on a design and if the wish is to keep control of that  
design, even a basic level of involvement with the engineer will  
be beneficial. Because of the complexity of the methods now used,  
Local Authorities are increasingly insisting on the submission of  
calculations prepared by a Chartered Engineer from the recognised  
qualifying bodies, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the  
Institution of Civil Engineers who are entitled to use the designa-  
tions CEng MIStructE or CEng MICE, respectively.  
# 1.4 Eurocodes  
Eurocode standards will continue to be relevant in the UK until  
the end of 2021 following an agreement between the BSI and the  
European Committee for Standardisation \(CEN\) to extend the  
arrangement for an extra year beyond the Brexit transition year.  
After then, it is likely that this arrangement will be subject to change.  
# 1.5 Key factors  
There are three important factors in structural analysis and design\:  
• Accurate assessment of the behaviour of the structural form  
• Accurate identification and calculation of all the forces acting  
• Full knowledge of the properties of the structural materials.  
An outline of the methods used is given in what follows.  
# 2 BASIC STRUCTURAL THEORY  
# 2.1 Introduction  
This section will summarise basic structural concepts and the terms  
that might be met in dealing with structural matters. Examination  
in greater depth may be found in the Bibliography given at the end  
of the chapter.

# 2.2 Limit state  
Current techniques in the majority of structural engineering Codes of  
Practice are based on the concept of limit state design. Traditionally,  
design involved calculating the maximum stress and deflection in  
a member under working load. That stress was compared with the  
stress in that material known, through experiment, to lead to failure.  
Safe design included a margin, called the *factor of safety*, between  
the working and failure stress values. This traditional method was  
generally referred to as *permissible stress* design.  
It is, however, important to anticipate how the form of the  
structure will behave under increasing load as factors other than  
excessive stress can cause building failure. These are known as  
*limit states* and must all be considered for satisfactory design. Apart  
from collapsing completely \(*limit state of collapse* or *ultimate limit*  
*state*\), a building may crack locally so badly as to let in the weather,  
or it may deflect until the users feel unsafe \(*limit state of deflection*  
*or serviceability limit state*\). The task of the structural designer is to  
ensure that none of the possible limit states is ever reached.  
In the case of the ultimate limit state, this is done by making sure  
that ultimate material stresses are not exceeded under critical ulti-  
mate load combinations. Ultimate stresses are derived by dividing the  
material failure stress by a prescribed material safety factor, and ulti-  
mate loads are calculated by multiplying the loads \(see Section 2.3\)  
by prescribed load factors. Both material and load factors are listed in  
the Codes of Practice relevant to the material being used.  
The serviceability limit states of cracking and deflection are  
checked using working loads rather than ultimate loads, as the  
actual crack width and deflection in service is of interest.  
# 2.3 Loads  
In Section 2.2, reference was made to loads. A load is an example  
of a force, and the term is usually used to describe those outside  
forces that act on a building structure. In Eurocodes, all loads and  
factors producing stress or deflection are called actions. Actions  
are of four types\:  
• Dead loads\: from the weight of the structure itself and that of  
other fixed parts of the building such as cladding, finishes, par-  
titions, etc.  
• Imposed loads\: from the weight of people, furniture and of mate-  
rials stored in the building.  
• Dynamic loads\: these are of many origins. The most common  
dynamic load on a building is that caused by wind, which can  
produce horizontal and vertical pressures and suctions. Other  
dynamic loads are produced by moving machinery such as  
overhead cranes in large workshops, and by earthquakes and by  
the weight of lying snow. For the purposes of design, dynamic  
loads were often transformed into approximate equivalent static  
loadings. The widespread availability of sophisticated analyti-  
cal software now allows more accurate dynamic analysis to be  
carried out.  
• The fourth type of action is one that is not produced by an out-  
side force, but by internal factors such as thermal expansion.  
# 2.4 Force units  
Forces, including loads, are measured in Newtons \(N\). One Newton is  
the force required to give a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m/s2. A  
tip to remember is that a Newton is about the weight of an apple. Most  
forces in structural engineering are expressed in kN \(kilo-newtons\).  
Table I gives conversions from and to SI, MT and FPS \(Imperial\)  
units for loadings of all types.  
# 2.5 Mass and weight  
Confusion often arises between the terms *mass* and *weight*.  
Outside nuclear physics, the *mass* of an object is a fixed quantity  
which is a basic property of that object. Its *weight* will depend  
on the mass and also on the value of the gravitational effect  
on the object. This is not a constant, but can vary, not only in

extra-terrestrial conditions but also even very slightly on different  
places on earth. However, for all practical purposes, the accel-  
eration of gravity is taken as 9.81 m/s2, so that the weight of a  
kilogram mass is 9.81 N. This figure is invariably rounded up to  
10 for ease of computation.  
# 2.6 Loading assessment  
Perhaps the most important calculation the structural engineer  
carries out relates to the accurate assessment of loading. Table II  
shows the loads of various materials which may comprise the fab-  
ric of a building that may be included in the dead load computation.  
It also gives the densities of materials that may be stored within it\:  
part of the imposed loads. The figures are given both in the usual  
mass density form\: kg/m3, and in the more convenient weight den-  
sity kN/m3. Some loadings are more conveniently calculated from  
superficial or linear unit weights, and a few are given in Table III.  
For a comprehensive list of weights of building materials, refer-  
ence should be made to BS648 *Schedule of weights of building*  
*materials*.  
Table IV indicates minimum imposed loads that should be  
allowed for in designing buildings for various purposes. These fig-  
ures are intended to allow for the people in the building, and the  
kind of material normally stored. However, these loads sometimes  
need to be checked against the figures in Tables II and III for more  
unusual circumstances.  
# 2.7 Structural elements  
For convenience of design, large structures are broken up into  
elements. These are of different types according to the function  
they perform in the building. Before describing each type, it will  
be necessary to explore the forces that are found internally in the  
materials of the structure. **Structure 6-3**

that stress and strain are proportionate, only applies in the elastic  
zone. Beyond this point, along the curve AB, there is no constant  
relationship between the stress and the strain. In fact, even if there  
is no increase in stress, the strain can increase over time until the  
bar breaks at B. This length of curve is known as the *plastic zone*.

# 2.9 Units of stress  
The basic SI unit of stress is the N/m2 \(which is also called the  
Pascal, Pa\), but this is too small a unit for practical purposes. The  
correct form for the normal unit is the mega Pascal, MPa or mega  
Newton MN/m2, but this is expressed by engineers in units of  
N/mm2  
.  
# 2.10 Tension members  
If the stress in a member tends to lengthen it, it is said to be in *ten-*  
*sion*. Elements in tension are called *ties*. In many ways, this is the  
simplest kind of stress. Some materials, steel members in particu-  
lar, are ideal for resisting it. Cables, wires and chains can be used  
to carry tension. Materials such as stone, cast iron and unreinforced  
concrete have little or no resistance to tension.  
**6.3** *Stress – strain diagram for a typical concrete*  
# 2.11 Compression members  
If the stress in a member tends to shorten it, it is in *compression*.  
Elements in compression are called *struts*, *columns*, *piers* or *stan-*  
*chions*. The term used depends on their location and the material of  
which they are made.  
Most materials other than cables, wires and chains can be used  
to carry compression. However, there is an instability phenome-  
non that occurs in compression members called *buckling*. For some  
members, particularly those that are slender in comparison with  
their length, increase in compressive load will cause bending until  
failure occurs in tension on one side. It is this buckling effect that  
can be the cause of the collapse of slender towers and high walls of  
masonry construction.  
# 2.12 Pin-jointed frames  
Some structures are designed and constructed of members that act  
as struts and ties. Analysis methods assume that the members are  
pin-jointed at their ends, which allows only the development of  
compressive or tensile forces in each member. A roof truss is typ-  
ical of this type, the general term for which is *pin-jointed frame*.  
In practice, very few such structures are actually physically pin-  
jointed \(although some have been built\), but the use of flexible  
bolted connector plates adequately approximates the theoretical  
assumption of a pin at member ends.  
# 2.13 Bending  
Unlike struts and ties, which transmit only compressive and tensile  
forces along their length, beam members support loads by bending  
action. Internal forces known as bending moments are developed  
within the beam allowing it to support loads acting at right angles  
to its length. An example of beam action is that of a lintel spanning **Structure 6-5**

an opening and carrying the applied loads from floor and walls  
above safely around the opening.  
Bending is the phenomenon by which a single member of sig-  
nificant depth develops both compression and tension across its  
section. Consider the case of a beam supported at each end with a  
load in the centre of the span, the deflected shape is a downward sag  
resulting in maximum compression in the top layers of the beam,  
and maximum tension in the bottom layers. Somewhere in the mid-  
dle of the beam \(longitudinally\) will be a layer with no stress at all.  
This layer is known as the *neutral axis*, Figure 6.4. The externally  
applied bending moment is resisted by an internal moment in the  
beam, which is a function of the product of the compressive and  
tensile forces and the distance between their lines of action.  
# 2.14 Materials in bending  
length resulting in zero horizontal reaction at the roller bearing  
end. If the loading is uniformly distributed along the length of  
the beam then the bending moment will be a maximum at mid-  
span. This type of beam is known as statically determinate as the  
support reactions and bending moments can be calculated using  
the basic equations of equilibrium.  
• *Cantilever*. This beam type is supported only at one end where  
it is fixed in both position and rotationally. The bending moment  
will be zero at the free end and a maximum at the support caus-  
ing tension in the top of the beam.  
• *Encastré or fixed end*. This beam is built in at both ends. This type  
of beam is statically indeterminate as the values of the bending  
moments are not calculable by normal statistical methods. These  
values actually depend on a number of imponderables, such as  
how much fixity exists at each support. Maximum moments will  
occur in encastré beams either at mid-span or at one, other or  
both ends, depending upon the disposition of the loads.  
• *Continuous*. A beam on several supports is known as a contin-  
uous beam. Generally, the maximum moments occur over the  
supports. Tension in the beam section over the supports occurs  
at the top, but occurs at the bottom at mid-span. Continuous con-  
crete beams have to be reinforced accordingly.  
• *Lintels*. Beams that are supported on brickwork, such as lintels  
over doorways and windows, are not considered structurally  
encastré, and are normally designed as simply supported.  
**6.4** *Structural member under pure bending*  
Since the internal moment of resistance of a beam depends upon  
the development of both compressive and tensile forces, only mate-  
rials that are strong in both compression and tension are generally  
suitable for beams. Steel and timber are good examples of such  
materials. Stone, being weak in tension, makes poor bending mem-  
bers. The ancient Greeks had to construct buildings with closely  
spaced columns, as stone lintels would not span very far. Only  
when the arch had been invented could the spans be increased,  
because the arch itself \(and the constituent parts\) is wholly in com-  
pression. Cast iron is weak in tension, although not as weak as  
stone. The bottom flanges of cast iron beams were often larger than  
the top flanges to allow for this inequality in strength. Concrete is  
also poor under tensile force, so steel is used in the tension zone  
\(which is usually at the bottom, except for cantilevered and contin-  
uous beams – see 2.15\), to reinforce concrete beams.  
# 2.15 Beams  
Beams can be categorised as follows\:  
• *Simply supported*. The beam ends are assumed to be completely  
free to move rotationally resulting in zero moment at each end.  
In addition, one end is assumed to be supported on a roller bear-  
ing allowing freedom of movement in the direction of the beam  
# 2.16 Bending moments  
In order to design a beam, an engineer first calculates the bending  
moments at critical sections generated by the worst case loading  
combination. Maximum internal stresses are then computed at  
those sections. For anything other than the simplest structure, this  
can be a time-consuming and complicated matter. For a large num-  
ber of the simpler cases, the moment at mid-span of an assumed  
simply supported beam will suffice to give a safe answer, if not  
perhaps the most economical. Table V gives maximum bending  
moments and deflections for the common cases likely to be met.  
# 2.17 Bending stresses  
Once the bending moment *M* is known, the stress *f* at any layer at  
distance *y* from the neutral axis can be found from elastic or plastic  
theory relationships. The choice of elastic or plastic design theory  
is dictated by the code of practice for the material being considered.  
For elastic design, the relationship is\:  
M f  
=  
y l  
The stress in the extreme fibre of a beam therefore depends on the  
*second moment of area* \(*I*\) of the cross-section, proportional to the  
cube of the depth of the section. Suffice it to say that the larger the  
depth of the section, the smaller will be the maximum stress. It is

expansion \(α\) × 10−6/°C therefore beneficial to choose cross-section shapes that have large  
*I-*values for the given area of material. For this reason, the most  
common shape of cross-section for a steel beam is an *I*; a greater  
distance between the flanges results in a reduction of material for  
the required second moment of area.  
There is a limit to this, however. Since the top flange is in com-  
pression, if it becomes too slender it can buckle. This is particularly  
significant in the design of steelwork and is the reason that beams  
have to be checked for lateral torsional buckling when the com-  
pression flange is not fully restrained.  
# 2.18 Shear  
In addition to internal forces generated by bending moments, most  
beam cross-sections will also have to carry a force in the plane of  
the section, called a *shear force*. Generally, the shear will be great-  
est at the supports of a beam, and least at mid-span.  
In the case of an *I* section, the shear force acts mainly within the  
web connecting together the two flanges that are in compression  
and tension. If the web becomes too slender, it can buckle under the  
influence of the shear force.  
# 2.19 Deflection  
Since the top of a loaded beam is in compression, it must reduce  
in length; the bottom, in tension, must stretch. This will lead to  
the beam taking up a curved form\: in the case of a simply sup-  
ported beam with vertical loading, it will sag. Excessive sagging  
is not only unsightly, but also may cause damage to finishes such  
as plaster ceilings, or cause load to be transferred onto partitions  
that are not designed to carry such load. Formulae are published in  
many texts giving the deflections of various kinds of beams under  
different loads.  
# 3 STRUCTURAL MATERIALS  
The third major factor in structural design is an adequate knowl-  
edge of the behaviour of the materials used. The basic palette of  
materials consists of masonry \(brick, block and stone\), timber,  
steel, reinforced concrete and glass. Design in alternative materials  
such as titanium, plastics, fabric and particularly eco-materials has  
becoming more widespread.  
# 4 MASONRY  
# 4.1 Use  
Masonry is the general term used for load-bearing construction in  
brick, block and stone; these are materials of interest to architects.  
Since they and the mortar that is used to fill the gaps between their  
# Table VI Masonry – vertical support elements  
# Structure 6-7  
elements are all weak in tension, such construction is normally  
used to carry only simple compressive forces in vertical elements  
such as walls and piers, sometimes in arches. Masonry can also be  
used to resist lateral loads from soil and water pressures in retaining  
walls, and wind loads when used in load-bearing masonry or when  
used as a cladding to a framed building structure. Masonry can be  
reinforced with steel bars and/or mesh to increase its tensile resist-  
ance and hence overall strength.  
# 4.2 Design  
Masonry should be designed in accordance with the British  
Standard BS EN *Eurocode 6 – Design of masonry structures*  
*Part 3\: Simplified calculation methods for unreinforced masonry*  
*structures*, supported by PD 6697\: 2019 *Recommendations for the*  
*design of masonry structures* to BS EN 1996–1–1\: 2005 + A1\:  
2012 and BS EN 1996–2\: 2006.  
The Institution of Structural Engineers *Manual for the design of*  
*plain masonry in building structures to Eurocode 6*, *2018* \(second  
edition\) offers design guidance for simple structural masonry.  
# 4.3 Vertical load-bearing elements  
A *wall* is a vertical load-carrying element whose length in plan is at  
least four times its width; otherwise, it is a *column*. A *pier* is a col-  
umn integral with a wall. References to walls apply also to columns  
and piers unless stated otherwise.  
The load-carrying capacity of a wall depends on the\:  
• Crushing strength of the masonry unit  
• Composition of the mortar  
• Size and shape of the masonry unit  
• Height of the wall relative to its width – its slenderness ratio  
• Eccentricity of the loading.  
Tables VI and VII give information on typical masonry designs.  
Although popular in the past, masonry is rarely used for floors  
nowadays. However, vaults and domed roofs continue to be built  
in traditional types of buildings such as churches.  
# 5 TIMBER  
# 5.1 Structure of timber  
Timber is probably the oldest building material used. Wood is com-  
posed of hollow tubular fibres of cellulose impregnated with the  
resin lignin, packed closely together not unlike a bundle of drinking  
straws. The result is that the material is strong in the longitudinal  
direction – in tension and compression – but weak along the inter-  
face between the fibres. **6-8 Structure**  
# Table VII Masonry elements carrying gravity loads  
# 5.2 Advantages of timber  
Consequently, timber has the supreme virtue of ‘toughness’. It  
usually gives a forewarning of imminent failure, as the weakness  
between the fibres inhibits the progress of transverse cracks. Even  
when failure has occurred, there is often enough residual strength  
to carry a substantial load. Its principal drawbacks are susceptibil-  
ity to insect and fungal attack and vulnerability to fire. Biological  
resistance can be fortified by treatment and a constant charring rate  
allows fire resistance to be designed in by over-sizing members for  
the required period.  
Timber is one of that minority of materials that is almost equally  
strong in tension and compression. This strength is such that buck-  
ling of the compression flange of bending members is rarely a  
problem. Rectangular sections are easily formed and used for  
this purpose. Timber is easily worked by hand and machine tools  
and it is simple to connect with other members, both other tim-  
ber members and those of steel, masonry and concrete. However,  
even moderately stressed connections require plenty of room to  
accommodate the required number of fixings and usually this is the  
defining factor in sizing timber elements. For instance, on a simple  
dining table the section of the legs is not related to its need to with-  
stand the compressive forces due to vertical downward forces, but  
more to do with how the leg is fixed to the tabletop or sub-frame.  
# 5.3 Design  
Advances in the technology of timber started in the railway era  
when it was used for elaborate viaducts and bridges. These were  
generally constructed by trial and error, calculation methods being  
developed later. Now, these methods of calculation have been  
taken to the point where they are a highly specialised field. The use of the current Codes of Practice by non-specialists is not recom-  
mended. In complicated timber structures, the sizes of the members  
tend to depend more on the design of the connections than on the  
internal stresses.  
Design of timber should be carried out in accordance with  
the Eurocode for timber, BS EN 1995–1–1\: 2004 + A2\: 2014,  
*Eurocode 5. Design of timber structures. General. Common rules*  
*and rules for buildings*.  
# 5.4 Timber sources and grades  
Timber can be home-produced or imported. There is a degree of  
standardisation, but the designer can encounter a wide variation  
in qualities and where appropriate it should have been classified  
to the necessary strength class. Timber should always be accessed  
from certified environmentally managed and sustainable sources.  
The applications and structural properties of some common types  
are illustrated later in Figure 6.10.  
# 5.5 Large timber sections  
Because of the shape and composition of the tree trunks from  
which timber comes, it is difficult to directly produce the larger size  
sections often required for modern construction, particularly for  
beams. For such larger sections, smaller timbers are glued together  
to form *laminated beams*, Figure 6.5, or load-bearing units of *cross*  
# Structure 6-9  
*laminated timber* \(CLT\). These are extremely useful for many  
purposes, and manufacturers produce handbooks giving compre-  
hensive data for their use. Laminated timber beams and columns  
and CLT are often referred to as ‘engineered timber’ due to their  
increased stability and more predictable structural characteristics.

# 5.6 Timber frame  
Over 80 per cent of the world’s housing is composed of timber  
frame and it is becoming more common in the UK. Tables VIII, IX  
and X give information relating to vertical support in timber and on  
frame and wall systems.  
# Table VIII Wood – vertical support elements  
**Table IX** **Wood – floors** **6-10 Structure**  
# Table X Wood – roofs, beam and deck  
# 5.7 Roof trusses  
Generally, UK architects use timber in two common places\:  
roof trusses and floor joists. Nowadays, most trusses are of the  
gang-nail type supplied to order for the required conditions. The  
manufacturer will supply calculations based on BS EN 1995–1–1\:  
2004 + A2\: 2014 Eurocode 5 for submission to the local building  
inspector. PD 6693–1\: 2019 gives guidance on maximum roof  
truss spans for single-, two- and three-storey, mono- and duo-  
pitch buildings, according to their pitch and wind zone locations  
within the UK.  
# 5.8 Floor joists  
For the design of floor joists, calculations should be prepared  
for final design by a qualified engineer in accordance with BS  
EN 1995–1–1\: 2004 + A2\: 2014 Eurocode 5 and PD 6693–1\:  
2019.  
# 6 REINFORCED CONCRETE  
# 6.1 Composition  
Reinforced concrete is one of the most prolific and versatile struc-  
tural materials available to the designer. It is composed of two  
distinct materials\: concrete and reinforcement, each of which can  
be varied in strength, disposition and quantity to fulfil almost any  
requirement.  
The concrete component is itself an amalgam of at least three  
constituents\: aggregate, cement and water. These are mixed  
together into a homogeneous mass, placed in formwork and left  
for the chemical and physical changes to occur that result in a hard  
and durable material. The strength and durability will depend on  
the quality and quantity of each of the constituents, and whether  
any additives have been introduced to the wet mix. Onsite mixing  
of concrete for structural purposes is only carried out for larger jobs which merit the setting up of a batching plant. Concrete mixed  
offsite at the premises of the ready-mix supplier is a quality con-  
trolled product, designed to meet the requirements of the specifier.  
An indication of early concrete strength can be assessed by 7- or  
14-day tests, but the specified strength can only be checked by  
crushing cubes of hardened concrete at 28 days. Cylinder tests are  
specified for strength comparison of mixes designed in accordance  
with Eurocodes. The crushing test will not necessarily indicate  
that sufficient cement has been included to fulfil the requirement  
for long-term durability. Sometimes additives are included in the  
mix to promote workability, early strength, frost resistance and so  
forth. Deterioration in the material due to some of these factors  
may not become evident for some years, but may then be disas-  
trous. For properties of various types of concrete, see Chapter 7,  
Section 5.  
# 6.2 Specification  
Provided a clear specification is prepared and concrete placement  
is checked by site staff, the concrete should fulfil its function  
indefinitely. This specification should be in accordance with BS  
EN 8500–1\: 2015 + A2\: 2019 *Complementary British Standard to*  
*BS EN 206. Method of specifying and guidance for the specifier*  
and BS EN 8500–2\: 2015\: + A2\: 2019*. Complementary British*  
*Standard to BS EN 206*. *Specification for constituent materials*  
*and concrete*, which cover not only strength requirements but also  
minimum cement content, aggregate size, cement type and other  
relevant aspects. BS EN 206\: 2013 + A1\: 2016 gives guidance on  
specification, production, performance and conformity.  
# 6.3 Design  
Design of reinforced concrete should be carried out to limit state  
codes in accordance with BS EN 1992–1–1\: 2004 + A1\: 2014  
*Design of concrete structures. General rules and rules for building*.  
A succinct guide can be found in *How to design concrete structures*  
*to Eurocode 2 – The Compendium – second edition \( 2018\)*, pre-  
pared by MPA The Concrete Centre. Span to depth ratios for slabs  
and beams are indicated in Table XI.

# 6.4 Reinforcement  
Reinforcement is generally steel rods, although other materials  
such as glass fibres and steel fibres have been tried in cladding  
units, and steel and polypropylene fibres are now commonly used  
for crack control in floor slabs on ground. The reinforcing bars may  
be smooth, round, mild steel, in which case the bars are referred  
to as R25 etc., the letter R indicating mild steel and the numbers  
indicating the diameter in millimetres.  
The other type of bar reinforcement is a high-yield bar referred  
to as T25 etc. In this case, the letter indicates hot rolled or cold  
worked high-yield steel and the numbers refer to the plain bar  
diameter of equivalent cross-sectional area. The actual bar size  
will be about 10 per cent greater than this due to the deformation.  
Stainless steel may be used for reinforcement in more aggressive  
environments.  
# Structure 6-11  
# 6.5 Mesh reinforcement  
For many structural elements, such as slabs and walls, it is conven-  
ient to use reinforcement in the form of a pre-welded mesh consisting  
of bars in both directions. Care should be taken in specifying the  
correct mesh as they have different areas of bars in each direction  
depending upon their designation letter. An ‘A’ square mesh has the  
same area of bars in each direction. A ‘B’ structural mesh has larger  
bars in the main direction and the area of bars in the cross direction  
satisfies the minimum area of secondary reinforcement requirement  
of BS EN 1992–1–1\: 2004 + A1\: 2014. It is important therefore to  
ensure that a structural mesh is oriented correctly, as indicated on the  
reinforcement drawing, in order that structural strength is not com-  
promised. A ‘C’ long mesh is similar to a ‘B’ mesh except that the  
area of cross wires does not meet the requirements of the standard.  
These meshes are generally used for reinforcing slabs on ground.  
# 6.6 Reinforcement position  
Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension, and rein-  
forcement is used to compensate for this weakness. Adequate  
reinforcement must therefore be placed wherever any tension is  
likely to occur. Simply spanning beams are reinforced near the bot-  
tom of the beam, with most reinforcement at mid-span. Shear forces  
also produce tensile stresses – links or stirrups are used to reinforce  
the concrete against the effects of these stresses. Sometimes the  
compressive strength of the concrete is insufficient for the loading.  
In this case, reinforcing bars can be used to help take the compres-  
sion as well. Such use for reinforcement is expensive and is only  
used when increasing the size of the beam is not possible.  
In cantilever beams, the tension occurs near the top. These  
beams have their heaviest reinforcement at the top of the beam,  
with most near the support.  
# 6.7 Effective depth  
The effective depth of a beam is the distance from the top \(or  
compression flange\) to the centroid of area of the tensile steel rein-  
forcement. It is indicated by the symbol d.  
# 6.8 Minimum reinforcement  
Stresses arise in concrete not only from the applied loads but also  
from a variety of other causes. For example, when concrete dries  
and sets it tends to shrink slightly. If it cannot move, it will tend to  
crack. Similar cracking will occur if movement induced by thermal  
expansion and contraction is inhibited. Consequently, to reduce the  
tendency to form large cracks, a modicum of reinforcement is used  
throughout, allowing the formation of a multitude of fine cracks  
which are invisible to the naked eye.  
# 6.9 Deflection  
In addition to limiting the stresses below the ultimate values, rein-  
forced concrete must possess sufficient stiffness to prevent deflection  
or deformation which might impair the strength or efficiency of the  
structure, or produce unsightly cracks in finishes or partitions.  
# 6.10 Concrete cover to reinforcement  
In all cases, there must be sufficient concrete cover to reinforce-  
ment. This is\:  
• To preserve it from corrosion  
• To ensure an adequate bond with the concrete  
• To ensure sufficient protection in case of fire.  
Tables A.10, A.12 and A.13 of BS 8500–1\: 2015 + A2\: 2019  
give limiting values for the nominal cover of concrete made with  
normal weight aggregates. In no case should the cover be less than  
the nominal maximum aggregate size, or, for the main reinforce-  
ment, the bar size. **6-12 Structure**  
# 7 STRUCTURAL STEELWORK AND OTHER  
# METALS  
# 7.1 Metals  
Steel is by far the metal most widely used for building structures,  
but other materials are used in ancillary elements. Table XII lists  
the basic properties of steel and aluminium.  
# 7.2 Design  
Design of steelwork should be carried out in accordance with  
limit state codes based upon plastic theory. Eurocode 3 BS EN  
1993–1–1\: 2005 + A1\: 2014 *Design of steel structures. General*  
*rules and rules for buildings*, sets the criteria.  
A book of tables published by the Steel Construction Institute,  
\(‘Blue Book’ – *Steel building design\: Design data* – Reprinted  
2015\) gives dimensions and section properties of currently man-  
ufactured steel sections. Tables XIII, XIV and XV give the  
dimensions for a selection of universal beams, joists and universal  
columns. This book also contains capacity tables which may be  
used to quickly determine the suitability of a particular section for  
preliminary design. More rigorous calculations to BS EN 1993–1–  
1\: 2005 + A1\: 2014 are generally required for final design.

# 7.3 Grades of steel  
Steel for structural purposes is available in the UK a range of stand-  
ard grades increasing in strength\: S275, which corresponds to the  
previous description of ‘mild steel’, S355, S460 and S500.  
# 8 GLASS  
# 8.1 Use  
Glass is being used to create spectacular structures in modern  
architecture and it can be incorporated as a structural material in a  
number of ways. Structural sealant glazing is described in BS EN  
13022\: 2014 Parts 1 and 2.  
# 8.2 Design  
The structural use of glass requires an understanding of the behav-  
iour of both the structure and the material. The inherent brittle  
nature of glass dictates consideration of the nature and conse-  
quences of any failure modes.  
The choice of international standards for the design of edge sup-  
ported glass panels is wide-ranging, but BS 6262–1\: 2017, *Glazing*  
*for buildings. General methodology for the selection of glazing*, is  
the current British Standard.  
# 8.3 Types of glass  
A number of processes are used to produce the main glass types  
used in structures.  
*Annealed float glass* is made by melting the ingredients \(silicon,  
soda ash and recycled broken glass\) together. The molten glass  
is then poured onto a float bath of molten tin where it undergoes  
controlled cooling, after which it is further cooled in an annealing  
oven. The resulting product exhibits elastic properties but suffers  
brittle fracture under impact, bending and thermal loading. Typical  
properties of annealed glass were shown in Table V earlier.  
*Toughened glass* is produced by heating and then rapidly cool-  
ing annealed glass. This results in a glass core which is in tension,  
sandwiched between surface layers which are in compression.  
Toughened glass therefore has an ability to sustain higher stresses  
than annealed glass. Toughened glass is prone to sudden shat-  
tering due to nickel sulphide inclusions. Such failure will also  
be instigated if the compressive surface layers are breached by  
scratching.  
*Laminated glass* is produced by bonding two layers of glass with  
a layer of acrylic resin \(usually polyvinyl butyral\). The resulting  
composite unit does not shard on impact and the fragments remain  
adhered to the PVB layer, minimising the risk of injury on failure.  
# 9 OTHER MATERIALS  
A more extensive range of construction materials are described in  
Chapter 7.  
# 10 FOUNDATIONS  
# 10.1 Nature  
The purpose of a foundation is to transmit the dead and live loads  
from a building structure to the ground. The nature of the founda-  
tion will depend on\:  
• Characteristics of the soil  
• Magnitude of the loads from the structure  
• Nature of the loads from the structure.  
In the majority of buildings, the loads transmitted to the ground  
will arrive either as point loads down columns or line loads down  
walls. For the type of building with which these notes deal, the  
magnitudes of these loads will not be so great as to significantly  
affect the choice of foundation system.  
# 10.2 Soil  
This will basically depend on the strength of the soil to carry the  
load. The term ‘soil’ in this context means not vegetable material  
suitable for growing crops \(topsoil\) but the material forming the  
surface of the earth to a depth of about 100 m, which is not so hard  
as to be classified as a ‘rock’.  
The technology of the physical properties of soil is called soil  
mechanics. It is not appropriate to deal in depth with this subject,  
but some simple principles are useful to appreciate the design of  
foundations.  
# 10.3 Bearing pressure  
The bearing pressure that can be carried by the soil is the additional  
load that can be carried on a unit area. A soil stratum at a depth of,  
say, 3 m is already carrying the weight of that 3 m \(overburden\) of  
soil. In fact, the bearing capacity of many soils increases substan-  
tially with depth. This is because a common mode of failure under  
excessive load is sideways spillage of the soil, often accompanied  
by upward heave of the material around the area of application.  
Obviously, this is much less likely where the load is carried at some  
depth.  
Since the bearing capacity represents the additional load the soil  
can carry, the greater the depth, the smaller proportion of the total  
\(or gross\) pressure this will form. In fact, it is even possible to  
produce zero or negative net pressure by removing the overburden  
and replacing it with something weighing much less, for example a  
hollow box. This is the principle by which loads can be carried on  
soft marshy soil; the analogy is that of a boat floating on water. In  
many cases, the architect will be told what the bearing capacity of  
the soil is at normal foundation depth – about 1 m.  
# 10.4 Pad and strip foundations  
These are the types of foundation most commonly met by archi-  
tects, and their design should only require the use of an engineer  
if there are complications. Care should, however, be taken in soft  
soils where settlement, rather than bearing capacity, is the critical  
criterion. See Figures 6.6 and 6.7 for examples.  
**6.6** *Width of a strip foundation, section*  
**6.7** *Concrete pier of gravel layer* **10.5 Other foundation types**  
It is frequently found that the loads of the building are so large, or  
the bearing capacity of the soil is so poor, that suitable pad or strip  
foundations will be either very deep or required to be so large that  
adjoining bases impinge on one another. The two common solu-  
tions to this problem are\:  
• Raft foundations, Figure 6.8, where the bases are combined  
together to form one large base. The raft has to be so reinforced  
to cater for the stresses induced by inequalities of loading and  
bearing capacity.  
• Piles, Figure 6.9, which are devices for carrying loads down to  
deeper levels than would otherwise be practical.  
**6.8** *Raft foundation as used on poor ground*  
**6.9** *Alternative pile foundation*  
Raft foundations are beyond the scope of this section; however,  
useful guidance on raft design is given in the Structural Foundation  
Designers Manual \(see Bibliography\).  
# 10.6 End-bearing piles  
Piles can be divided into those that carry their loads into the soil  
mainly by end-bearing, Figure 6.10, and those that act by virtue  
of the shaft friction at the interface between the pile length and the  
soil, Figure 6.11. End-bearing piles normally sit on rock or gravel  
strata with high bearing capacities. They may consist of a precast  
concrete shaft, driven into place with a large mechanical hammer.  
Alternatively, a hollow shell is driven and afterwards filled with  
wet concrete to form the pile. In either of these cases, the amount  
of penetration achieved at each hammer blow is an indication of  
the load-carrying capacity of the pile. A design method for simple  
end-bearing piles in the shape of the short-bored variety sometimes  
used in housing is illustrated in Figure 6.12.  
# Structure 6-15  
**6.10** *End-bearing pile*  
**6.11** *Friction pile*  
**6.12** *Short-bored piles \(Example 3\)*  
# 10.7 Skin-friction piles  
Skin-friction piles, mostly appropriate for cohesive soils such as  
clays, are usually bored. In this method, a circular hole is exca-  
vated in the ground by a large auger or other methods. If necessary,  
the sides of the hole are temporarily sleeved. When the necessary **6-16 Structure**  
depth has been reached, reinforcement is lowered into the hole and  
concrete is poured in. Some method of compacting the concrete  
is employed, so that all cavities in the ground are properly filled.  
The sleeve is withdrawn as the concrete goes in, to ensure intimate  
contact between pile and soil.  
The capacity of this type of pile is not self-evident as in the case  
of driven piles. Calculation is used to determine the length of pile  
required, based on the shear strength of the clay at various depths  
below the ground. Parameters for soil properties are gained by car-  
rying out a site investigation prior to the design.  
While the calculations themselves are not particularly difficult,  
the subject is one where engineering judgement is required in their  
interpretation. It is recommended that this type of pile should be  
designed by the specialist piling contractor and checked by the con-  
sulting engineer, with adequate supervision and testing on site to  
ensure that the pile is suitable for the design loads.  
# 10.8 Pile testing  
In both driven and bored piles, it is usual to carry out one or more  
tests on the actual piles on each contract. On very large con-  
tracts, additional piles are tested to failure, but normally one of  
the working piles is loaded to 1.5 times the working load to prove  
the efficacy of the design. These maintained load static tests are  
expensive and time-consuming, requiring the use of large concrete  
blocks \(kentledge\) or the installation of tension piles against which  
a jacking load can be applied to the test pile. Other, more rapid  
methods of testing by measuring the dynamic response of the pile  
to a hammer strike at the pile head can be employed, but engi-  
neering judgement is required to determine the correct regime and  
method/methods of test required.  
# 10.9 Under-reamed piles  
There is a third type of pile which is a bored end-bearing pile. The  
shaft is augured in the usual way, but when the required depth has  
been reached, a special tool is used to enlarge the base to a bell-  
shape, Figure 6.13. These piles are substantial in size, and remote  
inspection of the base must be carried out to check the integrity of the  
soil on which the load will rest. It is not often possible to test this type  
of pile using static methods due to the magnitude of the loads carried.  
**6.14** *Dead loads*  
Note\:  
A = a point load, e.g. a piece of furniture, machinery or even a  
person, where a force is concentrated in a small area.  
B = a uniformly distributed load \(UDL\), e.g. books in a library, cars  
in a car park, etc., where a force is distributed over a wider area.  
# 11.2 Deflection  
Deflection is illustrated in Figure 6.15. When a force is applied \[F\],  
the beam will be in bending and will deflect. It is the size of this  
deflection that architects need to be aware of.  
**6.15** *Deflection*  
*Serviceability*  
Will the deflection be so great that items of furniture move or users  
will feel unsteady?  
*Load transfer*  
Will the deflection be so great that loads intended to be taken by the  
framing member \(i.e. beam or floor plank\) are transferred to infill  
panels? See Figure 6.16a–c.  
**6.13** *Under-reamed pile*  
# 11 THUMBNAIL STRUCTURES\: WHAT ARCHI-  
# TECTS NEED TO CONSIDER  
# 11.1 Dead loads  
In reality, most loads imposed upon a structural member are a com-  
bination of both point load and uniformly distributed load \(UDL\),  
Figure 6.14.  
**a** *The infill blockwork is usually built up to within 10–15 mm of*  
*the u/s of the steel beam depending on the ‘designed’ deflection.*  
*The gap will often be filled with a compressible compound which*  
*does not transfer loading from the deflected member to the infill*  
*panel* **b** *The dimensions of the movement joint \(thickness of compressible*  
*compound or other detail\) must be greater than the designed*  
*deflection in the beam*  
**c** *If the deflected beam does come into contact with an infill*  
*panel or blockwork, the latter may buckle, as it will not have been*  
*designed to take the loading*  
**6.16** *Movement joints and buckling*  
# 11.3 Cantilever  
The diagram Figure 6.17 illustrates a very simple cantilever  
arrangement achieved by balancing loads alone. This is an unlikely  
scenario.  
**6.17** *Cantilever achieved with balancing loads alone* **Structure 6-17**  
**6.18** *Cantilever illustrating rotation, compression, tension and*  
*restraint*  
A more likely scenario is shown in Figure 6.18, in that there will  
be a pin or moment connection at A and B. From whichever direc-  
tion the force emanates, the beam will be in rotation about B.  
The column below B will be in compression \(or in the case of  
uplift, tension\) and the column below A will be in tension \(or  
again in the case of uplift, compression\) When in tension it will  
require restraint – some means of keeping it from pulling out of  
the ground. This may take the form of a heavy or deep \(or both\)  
foundation at C.  
In reality, the forces will be far more complex than those indi-  
cated, but the rule-of-thumb for a cantilever of 2/3 backspan and  
1/3 cantilever remains, as in Figure 6.19. Although in this diagram  
the force is shown vertically and downward, there may be uplift  
\(due to wind\) which will need to be addressed as much as other  
forces. This is especially relevant when designing with lightweight  
structures eg a sedum roof.  
**6.19** *Cantilever forces* **6-18 Structure**  
# 11.4 Bracing, racking and tri-angulation  
A lateral force \(e.g. wind\) imposed upon a structure will induce  
racking, Figure 6.20, unless precautions are taken to mitigate this.  
**6.20** *Racking*  
One method of achieving this to provide sufficiently robust moment  
connections at the point where the major structural members come  
together, Figure 6.21. A portal frame used in many warehouses and  
other industrial buildings is an example of this.  
**6.21** *Robust moment connection*  
Another method \(other design parameters considered\) to brace  
the frame is by introducing an element that will triangulate the  
structure. This element may be acting in tension, Figure 6.22, or  
compression, Figure 6.23, \(or both\) and of course will need to be  
designed to fulfil that task.  
**6.22** *Member in tension \(may therefore be a wire or*  
*cable – a tie\)* **6.23** *Member in compression \(member would need to be*  
*substantial and able to resist compressive forces – a strut\). Note*  
*that a lateral force exerted from the right side of the frame would*  
*put the diagonal member into tension. A single strut can be*  
*designed to resist both tension and compression*  
Unpredictable lateral forces \(and that is most of them\) need to be  
addressed by designing elements that resist both compression and  
tension. This can be achieved by using one strut or alternatively  
two ties – the latter is often preferred by architects for aesthetic  
reasons, Figure 6.24.  
Another means available to resist racking is the use of board  
or sheet material, such as plywood or OSB. In addition, some of  
the newer sheathing materials provide adequate bracing as well as  
acting as a breathable moisture barrier.  
**6.24** *Use of two ties to resist compression and tension*  
# 11.5 Arching  
The arch is an ancient method of spanning and its use has ena-  
bled our ancestors to span far greater distances than was achievable  
using the available stone or timber lintels.  
The early ‘Roman’ arch, semi-circular in shape, resolves its  
forces vertically at the point where the arch ‘springs’, Figure 6.25.  
The resulting lack of a horizontal component means that very  
thick walls or buttressing is not so important in ensuring the arch  
does not spread and collapse. It should be remembered that an irref-  
utable character of the semi-circular arch is that as the width of the  
span increases, so does the height of the arch – by the same meas-  
ure. This may or may not be a problem for the designer.  
**6.25** *Roman arch* The later Gothic arch, pointed at the top and not necessarily resolv-  
ing its forces vertically at the spring point requires something,  
usually the mass of the wall or additional buttresses and piers,  
to resist the horizontal forces, Figure 6.26. Although structurally  
more complex, the Gothic arch gave the designer the freedom to  
separate width of span to height of arch.  
**6.26** *Gothic arch*  
# 11.6 Buckling  
It is evident that as F increases, buckling is likely to occur, Figure  
6.27\. This is more so if F is applied off-centre to the centre-line of  
the supporting column or wall. In practice, this will almost always  
be the case – by design or otherwise. In theory, a perfectly vertical  
force acting through a perfectly vertical column along the central  
axis would result in a compressive force. In practice construction,  
and the elements used in construction, are less than perfect.  
In a steel or concrete column, buckling will tend to cause  
deflection, which may impact on finishes and infill construction.  
In a blockwork or brickwork wall, the imposed force can result in  
collapse and the loss of structural integrity, Figure 6.28.

**6.28** *Collapse*  
# Structure 6-19  
# 11.7 Increasing the effective span  
We know that the maximum span of any simple beam is related  
to its depth. But a beam’s effective span can be reduced \(there-  
fore allowing the beam’s depth to be reduced\) by introducing  
elements of structure along its length. This can be achieved in a  
number of ways.  
A bow-string truss, Figure 6.29, is a system of tension members  
held away from the main member. The lower horizontal tension  
member effectively deepens the beam and the vertical struts \(in this  
example in compression\), reducing the effective length or span.  
The same is true for a truss where the top and bottom flanges are  
separated by angled struts, Figure 6.30.  
**6.29** *Bow-string truss*  
**6.30** *Truss with angled struts*  
# 11.8 Roofing  
The members of a simple pitched roof arrangement resolve their  
dead and live load forces along the line of the pitch. In reality, this  
single force is in turn resolved into vertical and horizontal compo-  
nents, which are more or less simple to manage, Figure 6.31.  
**6.31** *Forces on a simple pitched roof*  
In Figure 6.32, it can be seen that the horizontal component forces  
the vertical supporting members \(they may be columns, they may  
be walls\) outwards, allowing the roof to collapse downward. The  
eaves being pushed outward is a sign of this and can be seen in  
many older structures where the roof is not tied across with mem-  
bers in tension to counter these forces. **6-20 Structure**  
**6.32** *Forces leading to collapse*  
One way of avoiding this is to tie across the rafters either with tim-  
ber \(working as a tension and compression member\) or with wire  
\(tension only\), Figure 6.33.  
**6.33** *Tie across the rafters in timber*  
A steel tie is sometimes used in situations where a heavy timber  
member may not be aesthetically appropriate, Figure 6.34.  
**6.34** *Steel tie across the rafters* The common roof truss used by volume house builders is a  
lightweight and efficient way of designing a domestic scale roof  
structure, Figure 6.35. However, the potential of using the roof  
space is lost.  
**6.35** *Common roof truss*  
# 11.9 Connections  
A pin joint is shown in Figure 6.36. As the beam deflects due to the  
imposed loads, it is free to rotate about the support.  
**6.36** *Pin joint*  
A moment joint is shown in Figure 6.37. In reality, most connec-  
tions are either bolted or welded \(steel\), bolted or nailed \(timber\) or  
cast \(in situ concrete\).  
**6.37** *Moment joint* **Structure 6-21**  
# 11.10 Typical sections  
For various constructional and aesthetic reasons, the architect often  
favours a steel section that the engineer is less keen on. The channel  
section is commonly suggested for a number of reasons although  
the engineer will point out that because of its eccentric profile it  
is far less efficient than the RHS or *I* section. A range of typical  
sections is shown in Figure 6.38a–g.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
The majority of construction materials are supplied to metric  
dimensions; however, a few materials still retain their imperial  
designations. Where appropriate, the listings are taken from  
British Standards or trade organisations and will therefore not  
necessarily correspond to the full ranges offered by individual  
suppliers. Inevitably, changes in published standards and Building  
Regulations will occur, affecting availability of particular products.  
Specifiers are, therefore, always advised to check current availabil-  
ity and delivery times.  
# 2 STEEL  
# 2.1 General  
The section on steel includes hot and cold formed sections and flat  
products as well as weather-resistant and stainless steels, coated  
steels and steel for the reinforcement of concrete.  
# 2.2 Steel sheet, plate and bars  
*Steel sheet*\: Cold reduced mild steel sheet is produced to the stand-  
ard BS EN 10130\: 2006 with thickness ranging from 0.35 to 3.0  
mm. Hot rolled sheet \(\< 3 mm\) and plate \(≥ 3 mm\) is produced with  
a range from 1.0 to 11.0 mm to BS EN 10111\: 2008. Tables I and  
II give the typical relationship between thickness and mass per unit  
area for cold and hot rolled products respectively.  
*Steel bars – flats, rounds, squares and hexagons*\: The stand-  
ard sizes for flats, rounds and squares are given in Tables III–V,  
respectively.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-9  
# 2.3 Structural steel sections  
*Structural steel sections*\: Hot rolled products of non-alloy structural steels  
are produced to the standard BS EN 10025–2\: 2019. Typical minimum  
yield strengths range from 235 MPa \(S235JR\) to 500 MPa \(S500J0\).  
Dimensions and masses for channels, I and H sections are given in BS  
EN 10365\: 2017. Tolerances for channels are given in BE EN 10279\:  
2000 and for I and H sections in BS EN 10034\: 1993. Table VII lists  
the standard dimensions and mass per unit length for universal beams,  
universal columns, tapered flange I sections and universal bearing piles.  
*Structural steel hollow sections*\: Structural hollow sections may  
be hot formed with or without subsequent heat treatment, or cold  
formed with subsequent heat treatment to obtain equivalent prop-  
erties to hot formed sections. Hot finished structural steel hollow  
sections are manufactured in 235, 275 or 355 MPa minimum yield  
strength steel \(e.g. S235JRH, S275J2H or S355J2H respectively\)  
to BS EN 10210–2\: 2019. Hot finished hollow structural steel is  
available as square, rectangular, circular and elliptical sections.  
# 2.4 Steel alloys  
*Weather-resistant steel*\: Weather-resistant steels \(BS 7668\: 2016  
and BS EN 10025–5\: 2019\) are structural steels alloyed with a small  
proportion of copper, which together with other alloying constitu-  
ents has the effect of making the natural rust adhere tenaciously to  
the surface to prevent further loss by spalling. The design detailing  
of weathering steel \(Cor-Ten®\) must ensure that rainwater run-off  
does not cause staining to adjacent materials, particularly concrete  
and glass, during the first few years of exposure to rain. Also,  
detailing should ensure no entrapment of pockets of water or damp  
debris to prevent continuing corrosion at these locations. Weather-  
resistant steel has been used for exposed structures in buildings,  
bridges and as a cladding material. The technical specifications for  
cold formed welded hollow sections in weather-resistant steels are  
described in BS EN 10219–3\: 2020. The equivalent standard for  
hot finished hollow sections is BS EN 10210–3\: 2020.

*Stainless steel*\: Stainless steels are a range of alloys contain-  
ing at least 10.5 per cent chromium. The corrosion resistance of  
the material is due to the natural passive film of chromium oxide,  
which is naturally regenerated if the surface is scratched. The  
grades of stainless steel for construction are listed in Table XI  
\(BS EN 10088–1\: 2014\). Stainless steel is available in hollow and  
standard sections for structural use and in sheet form for cladding,  
roofing and trim.

*\(Continued\)* \(Product sizing varies between HE AA, HE A, HE B, HE C and HE M.\) **2.5 Coated steels**  
The range of metal-coated steels includes traditional hot-dip galva-  
nised steel, aluminium-zinc alloy-coated and terne-coated steels. The  
durability of zinc-coated steel is dependent on the thickness of the  
coating and the environment, and the avoidance of contact with other  
metals, particularly copper, and the alkalis in wet mortar and plaster.  
In addition to hot-dip galvanising, a zinc coating may be applied by  
molten metal spraying, sherardising or electrolytically. Aluminium-  
zinc alloy coatings are more durable than the equivalent thickness  
of pure zinc. The standard alloys contain 5 per cent \(ZA\) and 55 per  
cent \(AZ\) aluminium in zinc respectively. A further alloy containing  
1.6 per cent silicon is durable without further protection in non-ag-  
gressive environments. Terne, an alloy of lead and tin, hot-dipped  
onto either steel or stainless steel, produces a durable cladding and  
roofing material. Tin-coated stainless steel, manufactured by electro-  
deposition, is also used for roofing where an appearance similar to  
lead is required but without the associated risk of lead theft.  
The predominant organic coatings to steel are polyvinyl chloride  
plastisol \(PVC\[P\]\), polyvinylidene fluoride \(PVDF\) and polyure-  
thane on zinc – aluminium alloy or zinc-coated steel. PVC\[P\] has a  
leather grain finish, PVDF has a smooth finish with good colour sta-  
bility and polyurethane offers colour and metallic gloss finishes. The  
products are available in a wide range of colours for use in roofing,  
cladding and interior finishes. Other organic finishes include polyes-  
ter incorporating acrylic beads and patterned or textured PVC film.

standard BS 4482\: 2005 refers to 250 MPa yield strength plain bars  
and the higher-grade steel, 500 MPa, for plain, ribbed and indented  
bars. The standard BS 4449\: 2005 specifies high yield steel \(500  
MPa\) with three levels of ductility, for ribbed bars. Austenitic  
stainless steel may be used for concrete reinforcement where fail-  
ure due to corrosion is a potential risk. Stainless steels suitable for  
reinforcement are specified in BS 6744\: 2016. Galvanised steel for  
reinforcing concrete is described in BS EN 10348–2\: 2018.  
Fibre-reinforced plastic rebars offer a corrosion-resistant alterna-  
tive to steel-based products. The most common products are based  
on glass-fibre, carbon fibre or aramid fibre and can be appropriate in  
marine environments where steel corrosion is a potential risk.  
# 3 TIMBER  
# 3.1 General  
For the supply of both softwoods and hardwoods, independent  
global certification schemes operated by the Forest Stewardship  
Council \(FSC\) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest  
Certification \(PEFC\) ensure sustainable forest management and a  
verifiable chain of custody.  
Timber used in building is either softwood or hardwood,  
depending on species; each may be supplied sawn or finished.  
Sizes are usually quoted ‘ex’, meaning the sawn size. Structural  
timber is classified into strength classes based on edgewise bend-  
ing tests \(Table XII\) to BS EN 338\: 2016 for both softwoods and  
hardwoods. Softwood strength classes \(Table XIII\) based on ten-  
sion tests relate to timber for use in glulam or where tension is the  
predominant load.  
The standard BS EN 13381–7\: 2019 relates to the contribution  
of fire resistance of applied protection to structural timber members.  
# 2.6 Steel reinforcement for concrete  
For details of sizes of steel reinforcement, refer to Chapter 6, Structure.  
Concrete should be specified to BS EN 206\: 2013 + A1\: 2016,  
and steel reinforcement to BS EN 10080\: 2005 \(weldable reinforc-  
ing steel\), BS 4449\: 2005 + A3\: 2016 \(bar/coil and decoiled steel\),  
BS 4482\: 2005 \(steel wire\) or BS 4483\: 2005 \(steel fabric\). The  
# 3.2 Softwood  
Target cross-sectional sizes for sawn softwood based on imperial  
and metric units \(Tables XIV and XV respectively\) are standard  
within the UK \(BS EN 1313–1\: 2010\). The complementary pre-  
ferred cross-sectional sizes for the UK and Ireland are included  
in Table XVI. Permitted tolerances on structural timber to BS EN  
336\: 2013 are given in Table XVII.  
Joinery timber requires a high level of finish and straightness, and  
is classified into seven quality classes \(BS EN 942\: 2007\) according  
to the number and size of visible natural defects, particularly knots.  
A wide range of standard softwood profiles are available. Tongue-  
and-groove boarding to BS 1297\: 1987 is to thicknesses of 16, 19, 21  
and 28 mm with standard widths of 65, 90, 113 and 137 mm.

prehensive listing of tropical hardwoods and their country of origin.  
Very durable tropical hardwoods for landscape architecture include  
Cumaru, Greenheart, Ipé, Iroko, Jarrah, Kapur, Massaranduba,  
Opepe, Teak and Wallaba \(TRADA WIS 1–31\: 2020\). The TRADA  
Wood Information Sheet WIS 2/3–10\: 2015 gives a comprehensive  
list of timber species commonly used within the UK.  
# 3.4 Strength classes  
Timber for structural purposes is machine or visually graded into  
an appropriate strength class. The machine strength classes \(Table  
XII\), which relate directly to bending strength, range from C14 to  
C50 for softwood species \(coniferous\), and D18 to D80 for hard-  
wood species \(deciduous\). The full range of characteristic physical  
properties of timber in the various strength classes are listed in BS  
EN 338\: 2016.  
# 3.5 Use classes  
Timber and all timber products are, to a greater or lesser degree  
affected by moisture. The environmental conditions in which wood  
and wood products are used are therefore categorised into five use  
classes by BS EN 335\: 2013 as in Table XX.  
# Table XX Use classes for wood and wood-based products \(BS EN 335\: 2013\)  
# Use class General service situation for wood or wood-based products  
Class 1 Inside a construction and not exposed to weather or wetting  
Class 2 Under cover and not exposed to weather but where occasional but not  
persistent wetting may occur  
Class 3  
3.1 Above ground and exposed to weather, but will not remain wet for long  
periods. Water will not accumulate  
3.2 Above ground and exposed to weather, and will remain wet for long  
periods. Water may accumulate  
Class 4 Direct contact with ground and/or fresh water  
Class 5 Permanently or regularly submerged in salt water **3.6 Timber products**  
The wide range of products manufactured from wood includes  
laminated timber, cross-laminated timber \(CLT\), laminated veneer  
lumber \(LVL\), plywood, particleboard, fibreboard and modified  
wood.  
*Laminated timber*\: Laminated timber sections can be manu-  
factured to any transportable size, typically 30 m although spans  
of over 50 m are possible. Strength-graded timber sections, con-  
tinuously glued with resin adhesive and the use of scarf or finger  
jointing within the laminates ensure a uniform structural product.  
Sections may be joined on site by finger jointing \(BS EN14080\:  
2013\). Units are classified to the appropriate overall strength class  
GL24, 28, 32 or 36 to BS EN 14080\: 2013. Beam lay-ups may  
be homogenous or with lower grade material for the inner lami-  
nates \(Table XXI\). Standard stock straight sections range typically  
between 35 mm and 200 mm in thickness and between 90 mm and  
630 mm in depth although larger standard sections are available  
from some suppliers. Arches, cranked beams, portal frames and  
other geometrical forms are made to design specification.

*Laminated veneer lumber*\: LVL is manufactured by laminat-  
ing timber strands with polyurethane resin followed by heat or  
# Materials 7-7  
microwave curing under pressure. It can be produced in sheets or  
billets up to 26 m long and subsequently machined as solid timber.  
It is frequently used in I-section joists for roof and floor construc-  
tion. The three grades appropriate to different environmental  
conditions \(BS EN 14279\: 2004 + A1\: 2009\) are listed in Table  
XXII. The requirements for structural LVL are detailed in BS EN  
14374\: 2004 and BS ISO 22390\: 2020. The pending standard pr BS  
EN 14374\: 2016 merges the two previous standards and proposes  
strength classes for structural laminated veneer lumber without  
crossband veneers as LVL 32S, LVL 50S, LVL 52S and LVL 80S.  
For units with crossband veneers, the strength classes proposed are  
LVL 22S cross, LVL 25S cross, LVL 32S cross, LVL 36S cross,  
LVL 70S cross and LVL 75S cross.  
*Cross-laminated timber*\: CLT \(see Figure 7.1\) described in pr  
BS EN 16351\: 2018 is similar to conventional plywood except that  
the laminates are thicker \(between 6 mm and 60 mm\). Panel thick-  
nesses are generally between 50 mm and 300 mm, although 500  
mm can be produced. Panel sizes up to 13.5 × 3 m are considered  
practical, but the standard production limit is 20 × 4.5 m \(subject to  
transportation constraints\). Curved panels with a minimum radius  
of 8 m are available from some suppliers. Panels are usually man-  
ufactured from spruce, but larch and pine may be available. The  
surface is planed, sanded or coated. Some hybrid CLT products are  
available incorporating either oriented strand board \(OSB\) or LVL  
as the central layers. The fire classification to pr BS EN 16351\:  
2018 for CLT \(minimum layer thickness 18 mm, minimum den-  
sity 350 kg/m3, minimum overall thickness 54 mm\), for walls and  
ceilings is D-s2, d0 \(excluding floorings\). The equivalent fire clas-  
sification for floorings is DFL-s1 \(minimum overall thickness 54  
mm, mean minimum density 430 kg/m3 with pine surface layer and  
400 kg/m3 with spruce surface layer\).  
*Plywood*\: Plywood is classified \(BS EN 313–1\: 1996\) according  
to its construction and properties including durability, strength and  
surface condition. Bonding properties and biological durability for  
Use Classes 1–3 \(dry, humid and exterior conditions\) are specified

in BS EN 636\: 2012 + A1\: 2015. Softwood plywood \(predominantly  
pine and spruce\) is imported from North America and Scandinavia.  
Temperate hardwood products are imported from Finland \(birch\)  
and Germany \(beech\), whilst tropical hardwood sheets are imported  
from Indonesia, Malaysia, South America and Africa. The standard  
sheet sizes are 1220 mm × 2440, 3050 and 3660 mm but larger sizes  
to 3660 × 3050 mm are available especially for concrete formwork.  
Thicknesses range typically from 4 to 30 mm.  
*Particleboards*\: Particleboards are manufactured from particles  
of wood, flax or hemp and a binder. Wood particleboard \(BS EN  
309\: 2005\) and cement-bonded particleboard \(BS EN 634–2\: 2007\)  
are bonded with resin and cement binder, respectively. Lightweight  
particleboards are defined to PD CEN/TS 16368\: 2014 as having  
densities below 600 kg/m3 for use in dry conditions in non-load-  
bearing applications.  
OSB is manufactured from larger wood flakes and binder to BS  
EN 300\: 2006.  
The standard sizes of wood particleboard \(chipboard\) are 2440 ×  
1220, 2750 × 1220, 3050 × 1220 and 3660 × 1220 mm, with the  
common thicknesses within the range 12–38 mm. Two generic  
manufacturing processes are used for the production of wood par-  
ticleboard giving products with different properties. The pressed  
product is stronger, whereas the extruded board \(BS EN 14755\:  
2005\) may be solid or with void spaces. Standard grades of wood  
particleboard are hygroscopic and respond to changes in humid-  
ity, but humid-resistant grades are tolerant to occasional wetting.  
Grades of wood particleboard and extruded particleboard are listed  
in Tables XXIII and XXIV.  
Cement-bonded particleboard has good resistance to fire, water,  
fungal attack and frost. The standard \(BS EN 634–2\: 2007\) specifies  
only one grade as in Table XXV. Board sizes are typically 1200 ×  
2400, 2660 or 3050 mm with standard thickness of 12 and 18 mm,  
although sheets up to 40 mm thickness are manufactured. OSB is  
graded \(Table XXVI\) to its anticipated loading and environmental  
conditions \(BS EN 300\: 2006\). It is available in sheet thicknesses  
from 6 to 38 mm, although the standard range is from 9 to 18 mm.

Note\: Boards of grades OSB/3 and OSB/4 are suitable for Use Classes 1 and 2 to BS  
EN 335\: 2013.  
*Fibreboards*\: Fibreboards \(BS EN 622–1\: 2003\) are manufac-  
tured from wood or other plant fibres, and generally are bonded  
under pressure using the natural adhesive properties and felting  
of the fibres. In the case of medium-density fibreboard \(MDF\), a  
resin-bonding agent is used. Essentially, differing degrees of com-  
pression give rise to the product range, although some products  
are impregnated with additives. Typical densities of wet-process  
fibreboards are softboard \< 400 kg/m3, medium board ≥ 400 kg/m3  
to \< 900 kg/m3 and hardboard ≥ 900 kg/m3 \(BS ISO 27769\: 2016\).  
Tables XXVII–XXX give the grades of MDF \(BS EN 622–5\:  
2009\), hardboard \(BS EN 622–2\: 2004\), medium board \(BS EN  
622–3\: 2004\) and softboard \(BS EN 622–4\: 2019\), respectively.  
*Modified wood*\: Wood may be modified either by heat treat-  
ment or by chemical reagents. Thermal modification \(DD CEN/  
TS 15679\: 2007\) involves the heating of usually pine or spruce,  
but also certain hardwoods, to between 180°C and 240°C within  
an inert atmosphere. The durability is significantly increased,  
but with some reduction in strength. Thermally modified timber  
\(TMT\) classes are listed in Table XXXI. Chemical modification  
involves the acetylation \(Accoya®\) or furfurylation \(Kebony®\) of  
the timber leading to a Class 1 durable material, without changes  
to the physical properties of the material. A small range of colours  
are commercially available. An alternative process involves the  
impregnation of timber with phenol urea formaldehyde \(PUF\) resin  
followed by high temperature curing to give a durable product.  
# 4 BRICKS AND BLOCKS  
# 4.1 Bricks  
The standard work size for UK clay bricks is 215 × 102.5 × 65 mm  
\(coordinating size 225 × 112.5 × 75 mm\). However, larger units  
to over 500 mm in length and thicknesses down to 38 mm offer  
variations in bonding and enhanced horizontal effects. \(Typical  
sizes are 400 × 40 mm and 510 × 40 mm\). Clay bricks are sup-  
plied in a wide variety of face colours, textures \(including glazed\),  
frost resistance/active soluble salt content \(Table XXXII\) and other  
properties. Most UK bricks are defined by the National Annex to  
BS EN 771–1\: 2011 + A1\: 2005 as high-density \(HD\) masonry  
units. The National Annex refers to the standard UK brick size,  
also to the two grades of engineering/DPC bricks common within  
the UK \(Table XXXIII\). The standard BS EN 771–1\: 2011 + A1\:  
2005 lists the wide-ranging specifications required for clay bricks.  
The standard distinguishes between units to be used in unprotected  
masonry \(U\) and units for protected masonry \(P\). The UK stand-  
ard sizes for concrete bricks are covered by the National Annex to  
BS EN 771–3\: 2011 \(Table XXXIV\). Brick manufacturers usually  
offer specials from within the British Standard range \(BS 4729\:  
2005 + A1\: 2016\). **Table XXVII** **Grades of medium-density fibreboard \(MDF\) \(BS EN 622–5\: 2009\)**

The five methods for the specification of concrete mixes are  
described in BS 8500–1\: 2015 + A2\: 2019 and BS EN 206\: 2013 +  
A1\: 2016\:  
• Designated concrete  
• Designed concrete  
• Prescribed concrete  
• Standardised prescribed concrete  
• Proprietary concrete.  
For routine applications, designated concrete is usually  
appropriate. The purchaser correctly specifies the proposed use  
and the mix designation, and the producer fulfils the normal per-  
formance criteria. In designed concrete, the purchaser takes more  
responsibility for the mix by specifying a complete set of perfor-  
mance criteria. For prescribed concrete, the purchaser specifies  
all materials including any admixtures by weight. Standardised  
prescribed concretes are a set of five standard mixes for routine  
applications as in housing. Proprietary concrete must fulfil the  
appropriate performance criteria but the composition is to the  
producer’s choice.  
The standard BS 8500–1\: 2015 + A2\: 2019 lists the appropriate  
exposure classes in relation to environmental and ground condi-  
tions and gives typical UK examples.

A special grade of very early strength concrete is used in the  
production of 3D printed concrete construction. The thixotropic  
mix has a maximum particle size of 16 mm making it suitable for  
both pumping and printing. The production is directly controlled  
from the Building Information Modelling model incorporating cut-  
outs for reinforcement and services.  
# 5.3 Reinforced concrete  
Reinforced concrete is described in Chapter 6, Structure.  
# 5 CONCRETE  
# 5.1 Cement  
Cements are classified according to their main constituents, such  
as Portland cement or blast furnace cement. The standard BS EN  
197–1\: 2011 lists five main types of cement\:  
• CEM I Portland cement  
• CEM II Portland-composite cement  
• CEM III Blast furnace cement  
• CEM IV Pozzolanic cement  
• CEM V Composite cement.  
Within these five main types a wide range of additional con-  
stituents including silica fume, natural or industrial pozzolanas,  
calcareous or siliceous fly ash and burnt shale may be incorporated.  
The full range of permitted compositions and strength classes are  
listed in the standard BS EN 197–1\: 2011.  
Appropriate properties of aggregates for concrete are listed in the  
provisional standard pr BS EN 12620\: 2015. The wide range of light-  
weight aggregates is listed in BS EN 13055\: 2016 \(Table XXXIX\).  
# 5.4 Concrete components  
*Paving flags*\: Concrete paving flags are manufactured to the  
requirements of BS EN 1339\: 2003. The standard does not spec-  
ify preferred dimensions, except a maximum length of 1 m. UK  
flags, however, are traditionally supplied in the dimensions given  
in Table XL. Tactile flags are used in the pedestrian pavement  
adjacent to pedestrian crossings to indicate their presence to people  
who are visually impaired.  
The standard \(BS EN 1339\: 2003\) refers to four classes of  
flag related to ranges of strength and durability. Class 1 flags are  
appropriate for light domestic use \(gardens/drives\), Class 3 flags  
are suitable for normal public areas, but Class 4 is required for  
very heavy pedestrian and vehicular use. Class 1 products are  
not resistant to freeze/thaw effects, but Class 3 flags are resistant  
to repeated freezing and thawing and the regular use of de-icing  
salts. **Materials 7-11**  
*Roofing tiles*\: Concrete plain roofing tiles may normally be used  
on pitches down to 30° or 35°. Some concrete interlocking tiles  
may be used down to a 12.5° or 15° pitch, subject to manufactur-  
er’s specification. A pitch of 10° is achievable in a narrow range  
of products. Concrete slates are manufactured with either deep or  
shallow profiles to emulate thin or rustic natural slate.  
*Precast concrete panels*\: Precast concrete panels, Figure 7.2,  
may be cast vertically or horizontally, although the latter is more  
common. Horizontally cast units may be manufactured face up or  
face down according to the surface finish required. Moulds may be  
of plywood, plastics or steel and indirect finishes, e.g. bush ham-  
mering, can be applied. Appropriate reinforcements and/or facings  
of stone or brick may be incorporated into the moulds.

# 6.1 General  
Wrought aluminium and its alloys are designated by the letters  
European Norm Wrought Aluminium \(EN AW\) followed by a  
unique four-digit coding to BS EN 573–1\: 2004. The standard BS  
EN 573–3\: 2019 details the chemical composition and form of the  
products. Table XLI gives examples of the standard construction  
alloys. Aluminium may also be cast into components. Aluminium  
is used for a wide range of non-structural products, Figure 7.3. The  
range of aluminium finishes includes anodising, texturing, perfora-  
tion, metallic \(zinc\) and plastic \(polyester, PVC or PVDF\) coatings.  
# 6.2 Aluminium sections  
Aluminium sizes for round section typically range from 3 to 200  
mm diameter, for square section from 3 to 180 mm side and for  
flat sections from 3 to 70 mm × 10 to 250 mm depending upon the  
manufacturer.

# 7 ROOFING AND CLADDING  
# 7.1 General  
The choice of roofing materials is related to a combination of cost,  
durability and particularly aesthetics. Many roofing materials such  
as asphalt are available only in neutral colours, but single-layer  
PVC, for example, is available in a range of colours. Metal roofing  
systems give visual articulation, and the choice of the particular  
metal or coated metal determines both the initial and weathered  
finish. In all cases, careful detailing enhances the period to first  
maintenance.  
The code of practice BS 5427\: 2016 + A1\: 2017 gives a com-  
prehensive guide to use of the wide range of profile sheet materials  
for roof and wall cladding. Sheet metal for roofing and cladding is  
covered in the standards pr BS EN 14782\: 2015 and BS EN 14783\:  
2013 for self-supporting and fully supported sheet metal, respec-  
tively. The standards list minimum thicknesses for aluminium,  
steel, stainless steel, zinc and copper as well as lead for fully sup-  
ported systems. The standard BS 8747\: 2007 relates to reinforced  
bitumen membranes for roofing and traditional mastic asphalt is  
covered by BS 6925\: 1988.  
The broader aspects of external cladding systems with respect  
to fire are covered by BS 8414 Parts 1 and 2\: 2020 and BS 9414\:  
2019\. Rainscreens, external thermal insulated composite systems  
\(ETICS\) and self-supporting double skin metal faced insulating  
\(sandwich\) panels are all considered. **7-12 Materials**

# 7.3 Stainless steel  
Stainless steel as a sheet roofing material is covered by pr BS  
EN 508–3\: 2020 for the self-supporting material and by BS EN  
502\: 2013 for the fully supported product. The standard pr BS EN  
508–3\: 2020 gives examples of sheet and tile profiles also organic  
coatings including polyvinylchloride \(plastisol\), polyvinylidene  
fluoride, polyurethane and polyesters. The standard BS EN 502\:  
2013 lists the equivalent data for fully supported roofing systems.  
Table XLIII gives the most commonly used grades of stainless  
steel sheeting with and without organic coatings. The appropriate  
grade and finish depends upon the local environment and durability  
requirements.

# 7.4 Aluminium  
The code of practice for aluminium sheet roof and wall covering,  
CP143 Part 15\: 1973, is still current. Sheeting comes to site in  
coils, and is passed continuously through a machine to form stand-  
ing seams in-situ. This long-strip system removes the necessity to  
form joints transverse to the standing seams up to a maximum of 7  
m. The standard thickness for long-strip aluminium roofing is 0.8  
mm and the recommended maximum width of 450 mm produces  
standing seams at 375 mm centres. A minimum fall of 1.5° is rec-  
ommended. The standard BS EN 507\: 2019 gives the specification  
for fully supported sheet aluminium roofing and the standard factory  
applied organic coatings including polyesters, acrylics, alkyds, pol-  
yurethanes, polyamides, epoxy and polyvinylidene fluoride.

# 7.5 Copper  
The standard grade of copper for fully supported and self-supported  
roofing is Cu-DHP \(C106\) \(phosphorus deoxidised non-arsenical  
copper\) to BS EN 1172\: 2011. The range of copper alloys is listed  
in PD CEN/TS 13388\: 2020. Sheet copper is available in a range of  
thicknesses from 0.4 to 1.0 mm \(up to 3.0 mm for curtain walling\)  
with 0.6 and 0.7 mm the standard thicknesses for roofing. Sheet  
widths range from 500 to 1000 mm with 600 mm standard for roof-  
ing. The standard BS EN 504\: 2000 gives the specification for fully  
supported sheet copper roofing.  
The two methods of copper roofing available are traditional, see  
Figure 7.4, and long-strip. Fully annealed copper strip is normally  
used in traditional roofing as detailed in Table XLIV. For long-strip  
roofing, 1/8 to 1/4 hard temper copper strip is required to prevent  
buckling with thermal movement. Typical long-strip dimensions are  
listed in Table XLV. Copper is also used for cladding; see Figure 7.5.

The standard BS EN 506\: 2008 describes the use of Cu-DHP  
copper for self-supporting profiled sheet and tile roofing systems.  
Prepatinised copper is available if the immediate effect of  
green colouration is required, alternatively a gold-coloured copper/  
aluminium/zinc alloy may be used if the copper colour is to be  
retained externally.  
Copper alloys have good anti-microbial properties at room tem-  
perature and normal humidity. Alloys high in copper content \(e.g.  
phosphor bronze and brass\) can control bacteria such as MRSA and  
*E.coli* and are therefore beneficial for use in touch surface applica-  
tions for hospitals and other public locations.  
Direct contact between copper and aluminium, steel or zinc  
should be avoided to prevent bi-metallic corrosion in the presence  
of moisture. Lead, stainless steel and brass are normally unaffected.  
Rainwater run-off from exposed bitumen and cedar wood can cause  
corrosion.  
# 7.6 Lead  
The sizes of milled lead sheet and strip are specified in BS EN  
12588\: 2006, and summarised in Table XLVI. The code of prac-  
tice for fully supported lead sheet roof and wall coverings, BS  
6915\: 2001 + A1\: 2014, refers to lead codes in addition to metric  
thicknesses. Sand-cast lead is manufactured for conservation work  
to weights similar to codes 6, 7, 8 and 9 to BS EN 12588\: 2006.  
Patination oil can be applied to new lead work to prevent the pro-  
duction of unsightly white lead carbonate staining. Typical lead  
roof details are shown in Figure 7.6.

roofing, cladding and gutters.  
Whilst lead is not prone to bi-metallic corrosion in most non-ma-  
rine building applications, the use of a building paper underlay is  
appropriate on hardwood roofs \(particularly oak\) and bitumen  
painting of the lead for contact with cedar shingles, hardwood cills  
and new concrete or mortar is advised. **7-14 Materials**

# 7.7 Zinc  
Zinc is covered by BS EN 988\: 1997. The standard thicknesses are  
0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8 and 1.0 mm \(Table XLVII\). Preferred lengths  
are 2.0 and 3.0 m, in a range of widths from 100 to 1000 mm. Pure  
zinc sheet roofing is no longer used, as it had a lifetime of approx-  
imately 40 years in urban conditions \(CP 143–5\: 1964\). However,  
zinc-copper-titanium alloy is the standard product and may be  
used directly or coated. Factory induced patina is grey or black,  
but mineral pigments rolled into the surface and coated with a pro-  
tective film produce subtle red, blue, green or brown preweathered  
finishes. Lacquered finishes include green, blue, red, brown, grey  
and gold. The minimum thickness to BS EN 501\: 1994 for fully  
supported roofing is 0.6 mm. Either traditional or long-strip roofing  
may be used with titanium zinc. A minimum fall of 3° is recom-  
mended. Where bays are longer than 3 m, a fixed zone and sliding  
clips will be required to accommodate thermal movement.

# 7.8 Titanium  
Titanium sheet \(0.3–0.4 mm\) may be used as roofing or cladding.  
The 99 per cent pure material used for construction work has a den-  
sity \(4510 kg/m3\) intermediate between that of steel and aluminium  
and a low coefficient of expansion \(8.9 × 10-6°C\). The natural oxide  
film can be thickened by anodising to a range of colours between  
blue and cream, or a textured finish may be applied.  
# 7.9 Reinforced bitumen membranes for roofing  
The standard BS 8747\: 2007 is a guide to the selection and speci-  
fication of reinforced bitumen roofing membranes. It describes the  
standard types of glass-fibre and polyester based reinforced bitumen  
roofing membranes and the high performance polymer-modified  
bitumen membranes manufactured with atactic polypropylene  
\(APP\) or styrene – butadiene – styrene \(SBS\).  
The measurable tensile class S and resistance to puncture class  
P are categorised in Table XLVIII. The standard describes SNPN  
combinations appropriate to specified standard constructions.  
The Annex to BS 8747\: 2007 describes the under slating/tiling  
sheets and perforated venting layers as listed in Table XLVIII with  
reference to the superseded standard BS 747\: 2000.  
The characteristics of bitumen roofing membranes are described in  
pr BS EN 13707\: 2017 and BS 8217\: 2005 is the current code  
of practice.  
# 7.10 Mastic asphalt roofing  
Mastic asphalt for roofing \(also flooring and damp proofing\) is  
specified in BS 6925\: 1988, to the grades listed in Table XLIX.  
Polymer-modified mastic asphalts containing SBS are more dura-  
ble with enhanced flexibility. BS 8218\: 1998 is the current code of  
practice for mastic asphalt roofing.  
# 7.11 Single-ply roofing systems  
Single-ply roofing systems are described in the standard BS EN  
13956\: 2012. They usually consist of a continuous membrane  
between 1 and 3 mm thick covering any form of flat or pitched roof  
with limited access. The membrane material is typically a thermo-  
plastic, elastomeric or a modified bitumen system, which may be  
glass-fibre or polyester reinforced. Joints between sheets are either  
heat or solvent welded or sealed with adhesives. The waterproofing  
sheet may be fixed to the substructure by mechanical fastening, full  
or partial adhesive bonding or by ballasting to prevent wind uplift;  
see Figure 7.7. Mechanically fixed sheets require the fastenings to

BS 747\: 2000 has been superseded and was withdrawn in 2007, but the former designations are referenced in BS 8747\: 2007.  
Type 1F membranes are underlays for discontinuous roofs.  
Type 3G is not classified to BS 8747 as it is a venting layer and not waterproof. Type 4A membranes are underlays for mastic asphalt. **Table XLIX Mastic asphalt grades \(BS 6925\: 1988\)**  
# Type Composition  
BS 988B 100% bitumen  
BS 988T25 75% bitumen, 25% lake asphalt  
BS 988T50 50% bitumen, 50% lake asphalt  
Specified by manufacturers Polymer-modified grades  
be covered by a further layer of waterproofing material, usually at  
the joints between sheets. Many membranes are backed with a pol-  
yester fleece to smooth out any discontinuities in the substructure  
and where appropriate to assist adhesive bonding. Certain materials  
are available in a variety of colours or have mineral finishes.  
The range of thermoplastic elastomers is outlined in BS EN  
ISO 18064\: 2014. Roofing systems include PVC, thermoplastic  
polyolefin \(TPO\), thermoplastic polyolefin elastomer \(TPE\), vinyl  
ethylene terpolymer \(VET\), chlorinated polythene \(CPE\), chlo-  
rosulphonated polyethylene \(CSM\) and polyisobutylene \(PIB\)  
# Materials 7-15  
as standard products. Whilst ethylene propylene diene monomer  
\(EPDM\) and SBS or APP modified bitumen are the standard elas-  
tomeric and bitumen-based products, respectively. The modified  
bitumen products are usually up to 5 mm in thickness. Liquid  
roofing systems are typically based on polymethyl methacrylate  
\(PMMA\) or polyurethane \(PU\).  
# 7.12 Tensile fabric structures  
The two alternative materials for tensile roof structures are PVC-  
coated polyester fabric and PTFE-coated woven glass-fibre.  
PVC-coated polyester is available in a variety of colours and has  
an anticipated lifespan of approximately 10–20 years, although this  
can be increased by the application of fluoropolymer lacquers to  
the exposed weathering surface. The more expensive white PTFE-  
coated glass-fibre material is self-cleaning and non-combustible  
with an anticipated lifespan of 30+ years. A range of standard  
design canopies and shelters are commercially available as alterna-  
tives to bespoke designs. Ethylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene \(ETFE\)  
foils are used for inflated pillow structures.  
**7.7** *Typical single-ply roofing system – mechanically fastened and gravel ballasted*  
**7.8** *Typical green roof system* **7-16 Materials**  
**7.13 Green roofs** Green roofs are defined as either extensive or intensive according to  
the type of planting and the associated loading. The specification for  
performance parameters of substrates is described in BS 8616\: 2019.  
Extensive roofs are not designed for general access, but are planted  
with low maintenance, drought and frost tolerant species such as  
sedums, herbs and grasses. Only occasional access will be required  
for weeding and the filling of any bare patches. Intensive roofs, which  
support recreational activity with hard and soft landscaping, require  
depths of soil typically between 200 and 300 mm, and for large trees  
up to 1500 mm, giving additional structural loading. Intensive green  
roofs with access require appropriate health and safety edge protec-  
tion. Biodiverse or wildlife roofs replicate particular species habitats,  
which may have been lost from the building site and may incorporate  
areas of gravel, stones or decaying timber as well as traditional plant-  
ing. A typical green roof will require a multi-layer system \(see Figure  
7.8\) to support the planting and to ensure secure waterproofing of  
the substructure. Green roofs have the advantage of significantly  
reducing rapid rainwater run-off as a Sustainable Drainage System  
\(SuDS\), whilst enhancing air quality and giving improved thermal  
and acoustic insulation to the roof. Green walls, constructed with the  
appropriate growing medium contained in matting or blocks fitted  
to the building facade or based at ground level, require provision  
for automatic watering and maintenance. Green walls derived from  
climbing plants on a trellis or wires are more easily irrigated and  
maintained. In most applications, green walls require a waterproof  
backing when applied to a structural surface. Pre-grown panels are  
available to produce instant greening.  
# 8 GLASS  
# 8.1 General  
The selection of glazing for buildings is highly complex due to the  
wide variety of design requirements that need full consideration. A  
suitable methodology to ensure appropriate attention to all signifi-  
cant factors is described in the British Standard BS 6262–1\: 2017.  
The additional parts of the standard BS 6262 listed below give more  
detailed information on the following aspects of glazing for buildings.

BS 6262–4\: 2018 Code of practice for safety related to human impact  
BS 6262–6\: 2005 Code of practice for special applications. \(This relates  
mainly to structural fixings\)  
BS 6262–7\: 2017 Code of practice for the provision of information  
The key design requirements from BS 6262–1\: 2017 are listed  
in Table L together with additional commentary. Types of glass  
fulfilling the functions are listed in Table LI.  
Current Building Regulations with a focus on Dwelling \(DER\)  
and Building Emission Rates \(BER\) for energy conservation make  
the use of solar control and energy efficient glazing systems vir-  
tually mandatory in most new building situations. The Building  
Regulations Part L1A and Part L2A 2010 \(2016 England & 2014  
Wales\) give concurrent notional specifications for new dwell-  
ings and new buildings other than dwellings, respectively. For  
new dwellings, the calculated Dwelling Fabric Energy Efficiency  
\(DFEE\) rate must not be greater than the Target Fabric Energy  
Efficiency \(TFEE\) rate. For replacement windows in existing  
dwellings, a Window Energy Rating \(WER\) at band C is the usual  
minimum, but many manufacturers are targeting A++, A+ and A  
rated units. In addition, health and safety legislation and regulation  
requires the use of safety glasses in many locations. Sealants for  
structural glazing are described in BS EN 13022\: 2014 Parts 1 and  
2 and provisional standard pr BS EN 16759\: 2014.

Notes\:  
Solar factor\: The fraction of the incident solar radiation directly transmitted by the  
glass, including heat absorbed by the glass and re-emitted to the interior.  
Shading coefficient\: The ratio of the solar factor of a glass relative to that of 3 mm  
clear float glass.  
Light reflectance\: The fraction of the incident light that is reflected by the glass.  
U-value\: The measure of heat loss through the component or unit, measured in W/  
m2K.  
Weighted noise reduction\: A single figure rating for the sound insulation of building  
elements.  
Combinations of functions, e.g. self-cleaning and patterned glass are available.  
The descriptions of breakages are in accordance with BS EN 12600\: 2002.  
Critical locations for safety glass are illustrated in BS 6262–4\: 2018.  
Where there is a risk of human impact on glass in buildings, its manifestation is  
required in the form of lines, patterns or logos between 850 and 1000 mm also between  
1400 and 1600 mm above floor level \(BS 6262–4\: 2018\). Maximum sheet sizes are  
not necessarily safe sizes.  
An example of high quality glazing in a very sensitive architec-  
tural environment is shown in Figure 7.9.  
# 9 CERAMIC MATERIALS  
# 9.1 General  
The wide selection of ceramic building products arises from  
the diverse range of natural and blended clays. Clay bricks are  
described in Section 4.1.  
# 9.2 Roof tiles  
Ceramic roof tiles are manufactured from finely screened clay to pro-  
duce the traditional red, brown or buff finish, or sanded to increase the  
product range including brindles and blue. Plain clay tiles, including  
fishtail, club, arrowhead and beavertail features are normally hung to  
a minimum pitch of 30° or 35°; see Figure 7.10. Alternatives include  
interlocking plain tiles, pantiles and Roman tiles with plain, sanded  
or glazed finish, suitable for lower pitches normally to a minimum  
of 15°. Specific interlocking units are compatible with photovoltaic  
tiles or slates of the same profile. Standard accessories include hip,  
valley, verge and ridge tiles also vents and finials. **7-18 Materials**

*Architects to Westminster Abbey, London*  
Photo\: Alan Williams/Westminster Abbey  
**7.10** *Standard and feature roof tiles* The types, tolerances and physical properties of clay roofing  
tiles are defined in BS EN 1304\: 2013. The current code of practice  
for slating and tiling is BS 5534\: 2014 +A2\: 2018.  
# 9.3 Floor and wall tiles  
Tiles for floors and walls, manufactured by dry-pressing or extru-  
sion, are classified in BS EN 14411\: 2016. The standard refers to  
both glazed and unglazed tiles. Key physical properties include  
water absorption, breaking strength, durability and abrasion resist-  
ance. The codes of practice for wall and floor tiling under various  
conditions are the Parts 1–5 of the British Standard BS 5385.  
Guidance on the installation of wall and floor tiles is given in PD  
ISO/TR 17870\: 2015 Parts 1 and 2.  
Floor tiles, see Figure 7.11, are manufactured from a range of  
clays, typically fired to high temperatures \(e.g. 1130°C\) to ensure  
sufficient vitrification to give a highly durable and water-resist-  
ant product. Water absorption of Group 1 tiles to BS EN 14411\:  
2016 is less than 3 per cent. Group 2 tiles have a water absorption  
range between 3 per cent and 10 per cent, and for Group 3 tiles the  
range is over 10 per cent. Where high slip resistance is required, a  
studded profile or carborundum grit may be incorporated into the  
surface. Floor tiles are graded Class 0 \(least\) to Class 5 \(greatest\)  
according to their resistance to abrasion. Wide ranges of stock sizes  
are produced by individual manufacturers.  
Wall tiles are generally manufactured from earthenware clay to  
which talc or limestone has been added to ensure a white product  
when fired. Glaze may be added before a single firing or after an ini-  
tial biscuit stage before a second firing. A wide range of square and  
rectangular sizes are currently available. Adhesives for tiles are clas-  
sified in BS EN 12004–1\: 2017 and grouts in BS EN 13888\: 2009.  
# 9.4 Ceramic components  
Sanitary ware is manufactured from vitreous china, which limits  
water penetration through any cracks or damage to the glaze to a  
maximum of 0.5 per cent. For large units such as WCs and basins,  
**7.11** *Floor tiles* **Materials 7-19**  
a controlled drying out period of the moist clay is required before  
firing to prevent cracking. Glaze containing metallic oxides for col-  
ouration is applied to all visually exposed areas before firing.  
The quality of vitreous china sanitary appliances is categorised in  
BS 3402\: 1969. The specifications for vitrified clay pipes, typically  
manufactured from salt glazed earthenware, are Parts 1–7 of BS EN 295.  
# 9.5 Terracotta  
The russet colour of terracotta is associated with the presence of  
iron oxide within the clay. Terracotta is used for traditional features,  
particularly decorative wall blocks, ridge tiles and roofing finials. In  
addition, it is manufactured into durable rainscreen cladding units for  
fixing into proprietary facade systems. Faience, which is glazed ter-  
racotta, is a highly durable material, but it can be chipped on impact.  
# 10 STONE AND CAST STONE  
# 10.1 General  
Natural stone may be classified as igneous \(e.g. granite\), metamor-  
phic \(e.g. slate, marble and quartzite\) or sedimentary \(e.g. sandstone  
and limestone\). The standard BS EN 12440\: 2017 gives a full listing  
of UK and European natural stone. Cast stone \(BS EN 771–5\: 2011  
+ A1\: 2015\) is often manufactured to emulate the natural materials.  
Igneous stones, such as granite and basalt, are the most durable mate-  
rials, whereas the softer sandstones and limestones are more workable  
for shaping to the required form, particularly when directly extracted  
from the quarry. Low-grade slate delaminates and marble can be  
affected by acid environments. Sedimentary stone should be laid cor-  
rectly according to the natural bedding planes, see Figure 7.12, and  
may be tooled to a variety of finishes; see Figure 7.13.  
**7.13** *Tooled stone finishes*  
**7.12** *Natural stone bedding planes*  
Thin section natural stone \(6 mm\) may be bonded to lightweight  
backing materials as an alternative to traditional heavyweight clad-  
ding attached with durable fixings; see Figure 7.14. The detailed  
classification of stones and stone-working terminology is listed in  
BS EN 12670\: 2019. The code of practice for the design and instal-  
lation of natural stone cladding and lining is BS 8298 Part 1\: 2010  
and pr BS 8298 Parts 2–4\: 2019–2020. The technical specifications  
for stone masonry units and slabs for cladding are listed in BS EN  
771–6\: 2011 + A1\: 2015 and BS EN 1469\: 2015 respectively. The  
requirements for stone flooring are described in BS EN 12058\:  
2015\. The specification for cast stone is BS 1217\: 2008. Traditional  
stone walling is illustrated in Figure 7.15.  
# 10.2 Granite  
Most granites are hard and dense and are therefore highly durable  
building materials, impermeable to water and resistant to impact  
damage. Colours from within the UK range from red through pink  
and grey to virtually black. Imported colours also include blue,  
green, yellow and brown. The range of finishes include flamed,  
picked, fine tooled, honed and polished. For maximum colour and **7-20 Materials**  
**7.14** *Typical fixings for stone cladding*  
**7.15** *Traditional stone walling*  
crystalline sparkle, a highly polished finish is required. The high  
cost material is frequently used as a cladding \(40 mm externally,  
20 mm internally\) or cast directly onto concrete structural units.  
# 10.3 Slate  
Roofing slates range in thickness between 4 mm and 10 mm accord-  
ing to their origin. Roofing slates are traditionally riven, although a  
range of textured to polished finishes are optional for larger compo-  
nents such as flooring, sills and cladding. Colours from within the  
UK include blue, blue/grey, silver/grey, green and plum red. Slates  
are imported from Spain, China, Canada, France, Ireland, Brazil  
and India. The minimum pitch for slate roofing under sheltered  
conditions is 20°, or 22.5° in exposed situations, and fixings must  
be copper or aluminium. Recycled slates are generally available for  
conservation work. Slate for roofing and external cladding is spec-  
ified in BS EN 12326–1\: 2014. The code of practice for pitched  
roofs and vertical cladding is BS 5534\: 2014 + A2\: 2018.  
# 10.4 Marble  
Marble is metamorphosed limestone in which the calcium car-  
bonate has been recrystallised forming the characteristic veined  
patterns. Pure calcite is white, but colours arise from the impuri-  
ties in the original limestone. The range of colours available within  
Europe includes red, pink, violet, brown, green, beige, cream, grey  
and black. Marble is used for external and internal cladding, floor-  
ing and tiling.  
# 10.5 Quartzite  
Quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone, which, as a hardwearing  
material, is frequently used for flooring. Most quartzite is imported  
from Norway, Italy, Brazil and Ireland where it is available in  
white, grey, grey-green, blue-grey, yellow and ochre colours.  
# 10.6 Sandstone  
Sandstone is formed by the natural cementing together of sand par-  
ticles by calcium carbonate, silica, iron oxide or dolomite, giving  
calcareous, siliceous, ferruginous or dolomitic sandstones respec-  
tively. Sandstones may be coarse or fine in texture and range in colour  
from white, buff and grey through to brown and red. They are gen-  
erally frost resistant. Finishes include sawn, split-faced and various  
tooled surfaces. Apart from UK supplies, sandstones are imported **Materials 7-21**  
from Spain and Italy. Sandstone cladding is normally 75–100 mm  
thick, and must be fixed with non-ferrous cramps and corbels.  
# 10.7 Flint  
Flint is a naturally modified sedimentary rock in which silica is  
deposited into crevices within the chalk silt sea floor to form the  
characteristic nodules.  
# 10.8 Limestone  
Limestones consist mainly of calcium carbonate arising from  
recrystallised calcite or accumulations of fossilised shells. Oölitic  
limestones are formed by the crystallisation of concentric layers of  
calcium carbonate, producing spheroidal grains or oöliths. English  
limestones are off-white, cream, grey and blue, but additional col-  
ours are imported from France, Ireland and Portugal. Externally  
limestones must not be mixed with or located above sandstones as  
this may cause rapid deterioration of the sandstone.  
# 10.9 Cast stone  
The appearance of natural stones, such as Bath, Cotswold, Portland  
and York, can be recreated from concrete manufactured with  
appropriate stone dust and cement. Either a dry or wet casting  
system is used. Where standard steel reinforcement is incorpo-  
rated, it requires 40 mm cover from visual faces unless galvanised.  
Corrosion-resistant non-ferrous materials require a minimum  
10 mm cover. Many architectural components such as classical  
columns and balustrades are standard items, but custom-made  
products can be cast to designers’ specifications.  
# 10.10 Gabions  
Gabions are wire cages filled with crushed stone; see Figure 7.16.  
The cages are usually constructed from heavy gauge woven or  
welded steel mesh, which may be coated for protection or in stain-  
less steel. Most sizes are based on the metre module. The standard  
use is for earth-retaining civil engineering applications.  
# 11 PLASTICS  
# 11.1 General  
The plastics used in the construction industry are generally  
low-density non-load-bearing materials. Unlike metals, they are  
not subject to corrosion, but they may be degraded by the action  
of direct sunlight, with a corresponding reduction in mechanical  
strength. Many plastics are flammable unless treated; the majority  
emit noxious fumes in fires. Typical reaction to fire is cited in Table  
LII. The family of plastics used in construction is shown in Figure  
7.17\. Table LIII lists their typical uses in building.  
PVC accounts for 40 per cent of the plastics used within con-  
struction, predominantly in pipes, but also in cladding, electrical  
cable insulation, windows, doors and flooring applications. Foamed  
plastics for thermal and acoustic insulation are formulated either as  
open or closed-cell materials, the latter being resistant to the pas-  
sage of air and water.  
Whilst some materials such as rubber and cellulose derivatives  
are based on natural products, the majority of plastics are produced  
from petrochemical products.  
# 11.2 Thermoplastics  
Thermoplastics soften on heating and reset on cooling. The pro-  
cess is reversible and generally can be repeated without significant  
degradation of the material. Polyethylene \(polythene\) is availa-  
ble with a range of physical properties as listed in Table LIV.  
PVC, the most widely used plastic material, is available in the  
unplasticised form \(PVC-U\) and the plasticised product \(PVC\).  
Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride \(CPVC\) has a higher softening  
point than the standard PVC material. Extruded cellular unplas-  
ticised polyvinyl chloride \(PVCUE\) is used in the manufacture  
of components of uniform section, such as cladding and fasçias.  
The full range and typical construction uses of thermoplastics are  
listed in Table LIII.  
# 11.3 Thermosetting plastics  
Thermosetting plastics have a three-dimensional cross-linked  
molecular structure. This prevents the material melting when  
heated. Thermoset components are usually produced from partially  
polymerised powder, or by mixing two components, such as a  
resin and hardener, immediately prior to forming. The cross-linked  
structure of thermosetting polymers gives rise to good heat-resist-  
ant properties. The materials are generally resistant to ignition, but  
will burn within a fire. Typical uses are listed in Table LIII.  
# 11.4 Elastomers  
Elastomers are long-chain polymers in which the natural zigzag  
molecular chains are free to straighten and relax when stretched  
and released. The degree of elasticity depends upon the extensibil-  
ity of the helical molecules and the degree of cross-linking between  
the adjacent chains. Rubber is based on the natural latex product,  
whereas neoprene and other copolymers are petrochemical prod-  
ucts. Standard elastomers and their typical uses in construction are  
listed in Table LIII.

# 11.5 Composite plastics  
Composite plastics include Glass-fibre Reinforced Polyester  
\(GRP\), which is described in Section 12.2.  
Wood plastic composites formed from polyethylene, poly-  
propylene or PVC, blended with natural fibre products including  
wood chips, hemp or sisal, are durable materials. They have the  
significant advantage of incorporating recycled materials or waste  
by-products from other processes. These materials are described in  
BRE Digest 480\: 2004 and relevant characteristics are listed in the  
publication DD CEN/TS 15534–2\: 2007. Wood plastic composites  
are used for products such as cladding \(pr BS EN 15534 Part 5\:  
2019\), external decking \(BS EN 15534 Part 4\: 2014\), fencing and  
garden furniture, where durability is advantageous. **7-22 Materials**

# CRETE \(CEMENT\) AND GYPSUM  
# 12.1 General  
Composites such as the glass-fibre reinforced materials GRP, GRC  
\(glass-fibre reinforced cement\) and GRG \(glass-fibre reinforced gyp-  
sum\) rely on the advantageous combination of the disparate physical  
properties associated with the individual component materials.  
# 12.2 Glass-fibre reinforced plastics  
The majority of glass-fibre reinforced plastics are manufactured  
from polyester resin, although other thermosetting resins may be  
used. For most purposes, the glass-fibres are in the form of con-  
tinuous rovings or chopped strand; however, the highest strength  
products are obtained with aligned fibres or woven glass-fibre fab-  
rics. The proportion of glass-fibres ranges from 20 to 80 per cent,  
depending upon the strength required. Higher strength materials  
can be achieved using carbon or polyaramid fibres. The traditional  
laying-up process is used for the manufacture of most compo-  
nents. The mould is coated with release agent and then the gel coat  
applied, followed by the required thickness of GRP, which may  
incorporate reinforcements and fixing devices.  
# 12.3 Glass-fibre reinforced concrete \(cement\)  
Glass-fibre reinforced concrete is produced from a mixture of alka-  
li-resistant glass-fibres, Portland cement, sand and water. Typically,  
5 per cent by weight of 25–40 mm glass-fibres are used within the  
cement matrix. Most GRC units are manufactured by spraying  
the cement slurry to the required thickness within an appropriate  
mould, although extrusion and injection moulding techniques are  
also possible for small components. GRC is a durable material with  
high impact strength and low permeability to moisture. It is fre-  
quently used for lightweight cladding and soffit panels. Guidance  
on factory quality control is given in BS EN 1169\: 1999.  
# 12.4 Glass-fibre reinforced gypsum  
GRG with typically 5 per cent of standard E-glass-fibres has  
enhanced impact strength and fire resistance compared to stand-  
ard gypsum plasterboards. Standard GRG boards are available in  
a range of thicknesses between 5 mm and 15 mm. The material is  
easily worked and can be curved on site. GRG boards offer good  
fire protection to steelwork, when up to 120 minutes’ fire protection  
can be achieved using a double layer of 30 mm boards with stag-  
gered joints and appropriate fixings.  
# 13 PLASTER AND BOARD MATERIALS  
# 13.1 General  
The majority of plaster types used within construction are based  
on retarded hemi-hydrate gypsum. This is manufactured by heat-  
ing rock gypsum to between 130°C and 170°C. Keratin is the  
standard retarding agent, which is added to adjust the setting  
time to between 1.5 and 2 hours. Other additives and admixtures  
include fillers, fibres, lime, lightweight aggregates, pigments and  
plasticisers.  
# 13.2 Gypsum plaster  
Undercoat and one-coat plasters are blended with anhydrous  
gypsum, limestone, clay and sand to produce the required water-re-  
tention properties and setting time. Lime is incorporated in finish  
coat plaster to accelerate the set. Lightweight aggregates are com-  
monly expanded perlite and exfoliated vermiculite. On smooth  
surfaces or low suction backgrounds, an initial bonding coat is  
required. Typical applications for walls are 11 mm for undercoats  
with a finish coat of 2 mm or a single 13 mm coat.  
The types of gypsum binders and plasters are categorised in pr  
BS EN 13279–1\: 2017; see Table LV. A wider range of plasters  
and backgrounds is described in BS EN 13914–2\: 2016.  
# Materials 7-23  
# 13.3 Plasterboard  
Plasterboard consists of a gypsum core bonded to strong paper lin-  
ers. The finish surface may be either tapered or square edged. A  
plaster skim is usually applied as a finish. Standard board sizes are  
900 mm and 1200 mm wide and 9.5, 12.5, 15 or 19 mm thick. Nail  
fixings should be driven straight in leaving a shallow depression.

2005\. Angle beads for plasterboard are defined in BS EN 14353\:  
2017\. Self-adhesive 50 mm or 100 mm glass-fibre tape is normally  
used across joints between plasterboards and in standard plastering.  
# 13.5 Special plasters  
Special plasters include renovating plaster for use following the  
successful installation of damp-proofing and X-ray plaster con-  
taining barium sulphate for use in medical environments. Fibrous  
plaster \(BS EN 13815\: 2006 and BS EN 15319\: 2007\) is used for  
casting ornate plasterwork. Projection plaster is sprayed onto the  
background as a ribbon from a mechanical plastering machine; it  
then coalesces for trowelling to a smooth finish. **7-24 Materials**  
# 13.6 Calcium silicate boards  
Calcium silicate boards are manufactured from silica with lime  
and/or cement, usually incorporating additional fillers and fibres to  
produce the required density. Calcium silicate boards are durable  
and non-combustible with good chemical and impact resistance.  
Standard thicknesses are 6, 9 and 12 mm, although thicknesses  
up to 100 mm incorporating vermiculite are manufactured for fire  
protection lightweight boards. Appropriate products achieve 240  
minutes’ fire resistance. The provisional specification for calcium  
silicate \(CS\) products is pr BS EN 16977\: 2016.

# 14 INSULATION MATERIALS  
# 14.1 General  
Thermal and sound insulating materials may be categorised var-  
iously according to their use in construction, physical forms or  
material of origin. Generally, the key forms of materials are\:  
• Structural insulation materials  
• Rigid and semi-rigid sheets and slabs  
• Loose fill, blankets, rolls and applied finishes  
• Multi-layer thermo-reflective products.  
Table LVIII gives typical thermal conductivity values for a range  
of building materials.  
# 14.2 Inorganic insulation materials  
*Foamed concrete*\: Foamed concrete with an air content of 30–80  
per cent is fire and frost resistant. It does, however, exhibit a  
higher drying shrinkage than dense concrete. It is used for insu-  
lation under floors and on flat roofs where it can be laid to an  
appropriate fall.  
*Lightweight aggregate concrete*\: Lightweight concrete materi-  
als offer a wide range of insulating and load-bearing properties.  
Typical aggregates include expanded perlite, exfoliated vermicu-  
lite, expanded polystyrene, foamed blast furnace slag, expanded  
clay and pulverised fuel ash. The range of thermal properties is  
listed in Table LVIII.  
*Wood wool slabs*\: Wood wool slabs manufactured from long  
wood shavings and Portland or magnesite cement are non-combus-  
tible and resistant to rot. They combine load-bearing and insulating  
properties, and are typically used for roof decking. For longer  
spans up to 3 m, units with steel edge channel reinforcement are  
available. Composite slabs of rigid polystyrene or mineral wool  
between wood wool layers offer high levels of thermal insulation.  
The standard BS EN 13168\: 2012 + pr A2\: 2018 gives the specifi-  
cation for wood wool \(WW\) insulation products.  
*Mineral wool*\: Mineral wool is manufactured from blended  
volcanic rock, which is melted and spun into fibres. The material  
is available as loose fill, blanket, batts, semi-rigid or rigid slabs,  
ceiling and dense boards, according to the degree of compression  
during manufacture. Mineral wool is non-combustible and resistant  
to decay. Typical uses include loft, cavity wall and frame insu-  
lation. In addition to thermal insulation, mineral wool absorbent  
quilts are effective at reducing sound transmission within plas-  
terboard separating walls. The standard BS EN 13162\: 2012 + pr  
A2\: 2018 gives the specification for mineral wool \(MW\) insulation  
products.  
*Glass wool*\: Glass wool is made by spinning glass into fibres  
by the Crown process, similar to that for MW fibres. The mate-  
rial is available as loose fill, rolls, semi and rigid batts and  
compression-resistant slabs. Laminates with plasterboard and  
PVC are also manufactured. The standard BS EN 13162\: 2012 +  
pr A2\: 2018 gives the specification for glass wool insulation  
products.

Notes\: Individual manufacturers’ products may differ from these typical figures.  
Additional data is available in pr BS 5250\: 2020, BS EN 12524\: 2000 and BS EN  
ISO 10456\: 2007.  
*Cellular glass*\: Cellular or foamed glass is manufactured from  
a mixture of crushed glass and carbon powder. The black material  
is durable, non-combustible and water-resistant due to its closed-  
cell structure. The material is used for insulation in rooftop car parks and green roofs where high compressive strength is  
required due to the loading. The standard BS EN 13167\: 2012 +  
pr A2\: 2018 gives the specification for cellular glass \(CG\) insu-  
lation products.  
*Exfoliated vermiculite*\: Exfoliated vermiculite is manufactured  
by heating the natural micaceous material, causing it to expand  
to a product with approximately 90 per cent air by volume. The  
non-combustible material is used as loose fill, sprayed fire pro-  
tection to exposed structural steelwork and in fire-stop seals. The  
standards BS EN 14317–1\: 2004 and BS EN 14317–2\: 2007 give  
the specification for exfoliated vermiculite \(EV\) insulation prod-  
ucts before and after installation respectively.  
*Expanded perlite*\: Expanded perlite is manufactured by heat-  
ing natural volcanic rock minerals. It is used as loose or bonded  
in-situ insulation for roofs, ceilings, walls and floors. Additionally,  
it is available as preformed boards. The non-combustible material  
\(EPB\) is described in the standard BS EN 13169\: 2012 + pr A2\:  
2018\. It is also specified in BS EN 14316 Part 1\: 2004 and Part 2\:  
2007 for before and after installation respectively.  
# 14.3 Organic insulation materials  
*Cork*\: Cork is harvested from the cork oak on a 9- or 10-year cycle.  
For the production of insulating boards, the natural cork granules  
are expanded then formed under heat and pressure into blocks,  
bonded by the natural resin within the cork. Cork products are  
unaffected by the application of hot bitumen in flat roofing systems.  
The standard BS EN 13170\: 2012 + pr A2\: 2018 gives the specifi-  
cation for expanded cork \(ICB\) insulation products.  
*Wood fibre board*\: Wood fibre products are manufactured from  
a slurry of wood fibres, which is compressed, causing the fibres to  
felt together. A bonding agent may be added. The degree of com-  
pression dictates the final density and insulating properties of the  
product. The product is available as roll, batts or semi-rigid slabs  
and boards. The standard BS EN 13171\: 2012 + pr A2\: 2018 gives  
the specification for wood fibre \(WF\) insulation products.  
*Expanded polystyrene*\: Expanded polystyrene is a closed-cell  
product unaffected by water, but which is readily dissolved by  
organic solvents. It is combustible, producing noxious black fumes.  
Polystyrene beads may be used as loose fill. Four grades of poly-  
styrene boards are listed in Table LIX. Polystyrene boards must  
be protected with heat-resisting insulation when hot bitumen is to  
be applied. Although a closed-cell material, polystyrene boards are  
good sound absorbers for use within building voids. Grey expanded  
polystyrene, incorporating graphite, has enhanced thermal insulat-  
ing properties. The standard BS EN 13163\: 2012 + pr A3\: 2018  
gives the specification for expanded polystyrene \(EPS\) insulation  
products.

Note\: BS EN 13163\: 2012 + A3\: 2018 lists the range of types from EPS 30 to EPS 500.  
*Extruded polystyrene*\: Extruded polystyrene is normally pro-  
duced by a vacuum process. It is slightly stronger in compression  
than EPS, but has a lower thermal conductivity. Its closed-cell  
structure is highly resistant to water absorption, so the material is  
frequently used below concrete slabs and on inverted roofs, as well  
as for standard cavity wall and pitched roof insulation. Laminates  
with flooring grade particleboard and with plasterboard are avail-  
able. The standard BS EN 13164\: 2012 + pr A3\: 2018 gives the  
specification for extruded polystyrene \(XPS\) insulation products.  
*Polyurethane foam*\: Rigid polyurethane foam is a closed-cell  
# Materials 7-25  
foam, blown mainly by carbon dioxide but also with pentane.  
Polyurethane foam is a combustible material producing smoke  
and noxious fumes, but a flame-resistant material is available.  
The material is thermally stable and can be used under hot bitu-  
men, and good durability permits its use for inverted roofs.  
Polyurethane foam is frequently used in composite panels due  
to its good adherence to profile metal sheeting and other materi-  
als. Flexible polyurethane foam is an open-cell material offering  
good noise absorbing properties. The standards BS EN 13165\:  
2012 + pr A3\: 2018 and BS EN 14315\: 2013 Parts 1 and 2 give  
the specification for rigid polyurethane foam \(PUR\) insulation  
products.  
*Polyisocyanurate foam*\: Polyisocyanurate foam used for wall  
and floor insulation is combustible but is more resistant to fire than  
polyurethane foam and can be treated to achieve a fire-resistant rat-  
ing. The material tends to be rather brittle and friable. The standard  
BS EN 14315\: 2013 Parts 1 and 2 gives the specification for in-situ  
polyisocyanurate foam \(PIR\).  
*Phenolic foam*\: Phenolic foams are used as alternatives to pol-  
yurethane and polyisocyanurate foams where a self-extinguishing  
low smoke emission material is required. Phenolic foams are  
closed-cell materials which are stable up to 120°C. The standard  
BS EN 13166\: 2012 + pr A3\: 2018 gives the specification for prod-  
ucts of phenolic foam \(PF\).  
*Expanded PVC*\: Expanded PVC is produced as open, partially  
open and closed-cell foams, which are self-extinguishing in fire.  
The low-density open-cell material has good sound absorbing qual-  
ities. Expanded PVC is typically used in sandwich panels and wall  
linings.  
*Sheep’s wool*\: Sheep’s wool, as a renewable resource insulation  
material, is available in batts ranging from 50 mm to 100 mm thick.  
It is a hygroscopic material reversibly absorbing and releasing  
water vapour, which has a stabilising effect on the internal tem-  
perature of the building. It is normally sprayed with borax as a fire  
retardant and insect repellent.  
*Cellulose*\: Cellulose insulation is manufactured from shredded  
waste paper. It is treated with borax as a flame retardant and insect  
repellent. Cellulose insulation may be used in floors and ventilated  
lofts. For other cavities, the material is dry injected filling the void  
spaces. The material is hygroscopic. The standard BS EN 15101  
Part 1\: 2013 + A1\: 2019 and Part 2\: 2013 gives the specification for  
loose-fill cellulose insulation \(LFCI\).  
# 14.4 Multi-layer thermo-reflective materials  
Thermo-reflective insulating products consist of multi-layers of  
aluminium foil, non-woven fibrous wadding and thin cellular plas-  
tics. The aluminium foil may be plain or reinforced. The material  
acts by reducing conduction, convection and radiation. High levels  
of insulation can be achieved in relatively thin quilts, which may  
be loose laid or fixed.  
# 15 SEALANTS, GASKETS AND ADHESIVES  
# 15.1 General  
Although used in relatively small quantities compared with the  
load-bearing construction materials, sealants, gaskets and adhe-  
sives play a significant role in the perceived success or failure  
of buildings. A combination of correct detailing and appropri-  
ate use of these materials is necessary to prevent the need for  
expensive remedial work. Selections of typical uses are listed  
as examples. Standard BS EN 6093\: 2006 + A1\: 2013 gives  
guidance on the design of construction joints for gaskets and  
sealants.  
# 15.2 Sealants  
Sealants are classified as either for glazing or construction; see  
Figure 7.18. **7-26 Materials**  
The standards BS 6213\: 2000 + A1\: 2010 and BS EN ISO  
11600\: 2003 +A1\: 2011 relate to the definitions and specification  
of sealants in construction joints. Sealants are generally classified  
according to their movement accommodation as either plastic or  
elastic. Elastic sealants may be of low or high modulus. Sealants  
must be matched to the appropriate application. Typical joint  
design and sealant systems are illustrated in Figures 7.19 and 7.20,  
respectively.  
*Plastic sealants*\: Plastic materials include butyl, acrylic, poly-  
mer/bitumen sealants also oil-based mastics and linseed oil putty.  
Butyl sealants have a rubbery texture and are mainly used in small  
joints, preferably protected from direct sunlight. Acrylic sealants  
are typically used around windows for new and remedial work.  
Solvent-based bitumen sealants are frequently used in gutters  
and flashings. Hot poured bitumen is used in asphalt and concrete  
movement joints.  
*Elastoplastic sealants*\: Polysulphide sealants are available as  
one- or two-component systems. The one-component systems cure  
slowly by absorption of moisture from the air. They are suitable for  
joints up to 25 mm. The two-component systems cure within 24–48  
hours and are generally used for wider structural movement joints  
in masonry and precast panel systems.  
**7.18** *Classification of sealants in construction*  
**7.19** *Butt, lap and fillet joints* **7.20** *Typical sealant systems* **Materials 7-27**  
*Elastic sealants*\: Elastic sealants include polyurethane, sili-  
cone and epoxy materials. Polyurethane sealants are available as  
one- and two-component systems and are typically used in glaz-  
ing, curtain walling, cladding panels and floors. Silicone sealants  
are available as high- and low-modulus systems. The high-mod-  
ulus material is typically used in glazing, curtain walls, tiling and  
around sanitary ware. The low-modulus systems are used around  
PVC-U and aluminium glazing systems and for cladding. Epoxy  
sealants are used in stress-relieving joints where larger movements  
in compression than tension are anticipated, for example in floor  
joints and tiling in swimming pools.  
# 15.3 Gaskets  
Gaskets, see Figure 7.21, are lengths of flexible components of  
various profiles which may be solid or hollow and manufactured  
from either cellular or non-cellular materials. Typical applications  
include the weather sealing of precast concrete cladding units and  
facade systems. The standard materials are neoprene, EPDM and  
Cladding systems  
# Compressed gasket ncapsulated gasket Compressed sealing strip  
**7.22** *Concrete waterstop seals*  
silicone rubbers. Within cladding systems, gaskets may be com-  
pressed or encapsulated. In glazing systems, gaskets are either  
encapsulated or fixed with a zipper component. Waterstop seals  
manufactured from rubber or PVC are used in concrete construc-  
# Gasket fixed in Gasket inserted manufacture during erection  
tion joints; see Figure 7.22.  
# 15.4 Adhesives  
*Tile adhesives*\: The standard BS EN 12004–1\: 2017 classifies  
Facade glazing systems  
ceramic tile adhesives into three types\: cementitious \(C\), disper-  
sion \(D\) and reaction resin \(R\) as well as sub-classes as listed in  
Table LX.  
The majority of ceramic floor tile adhesives are cement-based.  
Grouting can be coloured as required. Thin-bed epoxy based adhe-  
sives are more water and chemical resistant and may be used where  
# Capping seal Recessed seal  
repeated spillage is anticipated.  
Wall tile adhesives are usually polyvinyl acetate \(PVA\),  
Glazing system  
acrylic or cement-based compositions. The acrylic-based adhe-  
sives are more resistant to water than the PVA materials, and  
therefore appropriate for domestic showers etc. The water-re-  
sistant, cement-based products are useable both internally and  
externally. Polymer-modified cement-based adhesives are  
appropriate for fixing marble, granite and slate up to 15 mm in  
thickness.  
Vinyl floor tile and wood block adhesives are generally rubber/  
bitumen, rubber/resin or modified bitumen emulsions.  
# U-gasket ipper H-gasket ipper U-gasket  
*Wood adhesives*\: The majority of wood adhesives are based  
on polyvinyl acetate \(PVA\). Water-resistant PVA adhesives,  
which partially cross-link on curing, are suitable for external use  
**7.21** *Typical gaskets for cladding and glazing systems*  
but not for immersion in water. Structural thermosetting wood **7-28 Materials**  
adhesives are mainly two-component systems based on phenolic  
or aminoplastic resins. Their service class conditions \(Types 1  
and II\) are specified in the standard BS EN 301\: 2017. The two  
types are further divided into three sub-classes according to their  
end use \[General purpose \(GP\), Finger jointing \(FJ\) and Gap fill-  
ing \(GF\)\].

Class S1 Deformable adhesive  
Class S2 Highly deformable adhesive  
Note\: The standard BS EN 12004–1\: 2017 has an extended listing of the combinations  
of type and class with appropriate descriptions.  
*Epoxy resin adhesives*\: Epoxy resins are two-component  
thermosetting adhesives which produce high strength durable  
bonding. Epoxy resins may be used both internally and exter-  
nally for fixing metals, ceramics, glass, timber, rigid plastics and  
concrete.  
*Cyanoacrylate adhesives*\: Cyanoacrylate resins are single-  
component adhesives which bond components held in contact.  
Curing is quickly activated by surface moisture. The bonding is  
resistant to chemical attack but does not offer high impact resil-  
ience.  
*Hot-melt adhesives*\: Hot-melt adhesives for application by glue  
gun are usually based on the thermoplastic copolymer ethyl vinyl  
acetate \(EVA\). Formulations are available for joining materials  
to either rigid or flexible substrates. Similar adhesives are used in  
iron-on plastic and wood edging veneer.  
*Gap-filling adhesives*\: Gun-grade gap-filling adhesives are  
normally rubber/synthetic rubber resins with filler reinforce-  
ment. Both solvent-borne and solvent-free systems are available.  
Typical uses include fixing timber and timber products to plaster  
and masonry.  
*Plastic pipe adhesives*\: Solvent-based vinyl resins are used  
for bonding PVC-U and ABS pipes and fittings. The adhesive is  
applied to both components which are then united and slightly  
rotated to ensure a full seal.  
*Bitumen-based adhesives*\: Bitumen-based adhesives for bond-  
ing bituminous sheet roofing may be applied hot or from solvent  
or emulsion based formulations. Products require even spreading  
to eliminate air pockets which could cause delamination.  
# 16 PAINTS, WOOD STAINS AND VARNISHES  
# 16.1 Paints  
The code of practice BS 6150\: 2019 gives a detailed description  
of paint systems and their appropriate applications to the full  
range of building materials. The code includes the preparation  
of surfaces, selection of paints systems and maintenance. Paints  
and varnishes specific to exterior wood are described in BS EN  
927–1\: 2013, and classified for masonry and concrete in BS EN  
1062–1\: 2004, for steel in BS EN ISO 12944–5\: 2019 and for  
internal surfaces BS EN 13300\: 2001. Terms are defined in BS  
EN ISO 4618\: 2014.  
Colours can be specified according to several systems. The  
British Standards BS 5252\: 1976 \(237 colours\) and BS 4800\: 2011  
\(122 colours\) define colours and colour for building purposes  
respectively. However, colour may also be specified by other sys-  
tems including\: the *RAL*® *Classic System* \(213 colours\), the *Natural*  
*Colour System*® \(1950 colours\), the *Colour Palette*® notation sys-  
tem or *Pantone*®. Some colour systems permit a conversion to RGB  
computer or CMYK printing colours. Visual comparison of paint  
colours based on observation and controlled illumination condi-  
tions is specified in BS EN ISO 3668\: 2020 based on hue, chroma  
and lightness.  
Paint systems generally incorporate a primer, offering protec-  
tion and good adherence to the substrate, an undercoat, usually an  
alkyd resin or acrylic emulsion providing cover, and a finishing  
coat providing a durable decorative surface. Finishing coats may  
be gloss, silk or matt finish. The majority of paints are increasingly  
becoming water-borne in response to environmental considera-  
tions.  
# 16.2 Special paints  
Special paints include light-reflecting, heat-resisting, intumescent,  
flame-retardant, water-repellent, multi-colour, masonry, anti-graf-  
fiti and fungicide products. Acrylated rubber paints are resistant to  
chemical attack; micaceous iron oxide paints have good resistance  
to moisture on iron and steelwork and epoxy paints are resistant  
to abrasions, oils and dilute aqueous chemicals. Anti-microbial  
coatings incorporating silver ions can reduce bacteria levels within  
medical environments.  
# 16.3 Natural wood finishes  
Natural wood finishes include wood stains, varnishes and oils.  
Wood stain microporous coatings for exterior use usually require a  
basecoat preservative, followed by a low-, medium- or high-build  
finish. Generally, for sawn timber, deeply penetrating systems are  
appropriate, whereas for smooth planed timber a medium- or high-  
build system offers the best protection from weathering. Whilst  
some solvent-based systems are available, many are now water-  
based to reduce VOC emissions.  
Most varnishes are based on modified alkyd resins either as sol-  
vent- or water-based systems. Polyurethane finishes may be matt,  
satin or gloss. The solvent-based polyurethane systems generally  
give a harder and more durable coating. Most varnishes for external  
use incorporate screening agents to reduce the degradation effects  
of ultra-violet light.  
Finishes such as teak and tung oil are used mainly for inter-  
nal applications where the visual effect of the wood grain is to  
be featured. Certain formulations, high in solids giving a micro-  
porous UV-resistant finish, are however, suitable for external  
applications.  
# 17 COMMODITIES  
# 17.1 Windows  
The typical range of window and doorset types \(BS 644\: 2012\) is  
illustrated in Figure 7.23. BS 6375 Part 1\: 2015 + A1\: 2016 and  
Parts 2 & 3\: 2009 gives guidance on the performance, selection  
and specification of windows and doors. The code of practice for  
the installation of windows and external doorsets is BS 8213–4\:  
2016\. The terminology for windows and doors is referenced in BS  
EN 12519\: 2018. Most standard windows are based on increments  
of 150 mm in height. A standard range of timber window sizes is  
listed in Table LXI. **Materials 7-29**

# Standard window widths \(mm\)  
488 630 915 1200 1342 1770 2339  
Note\: Imperial sizes are also available from some manufacturers.  
The following standards relate to windows constructed from the  
standard materials\: timber \(BS 644\: 2012\), aluminium alloy \(BS  
4873\: 2016\), steel \(BS 6510\: 2010\) and PVC-U \(BS 7412\: 2007\).  
Timber and aluminium composite windows are referenced in BS  
644\: 2012. The safety aspects of cleaning windows are specified  
in the code of practice BS 8213–1\: 2004. Where required by the  
Building Regulations Part B 2006 \(incorporating amendments  
2010 and 2013\), fire egress windows must be provided with a clear  
opening of greater than 0.33 m2 and minimum clear dimensions  
of 450 mm \(e.g. 450 × 735 mm\). The bottom of the openable area  
must not be more than 1100 mm above the floor. These windows  
must not be restricted or lockable with removable keys. Aspects of  
domestic window security are covered by PAS 24\: 2016 and BS  
8220–1\: 2000.  
Safety considerations \(BS 6180\: 2011\) dictate that any opening  
window less than 800 mm from the floor should be protected to  
800 mm by a barrier or restricted to less than 100 mm opening. It  
is a requirement \(BS 6262–4\: 2018\) that all glazing less than 800  
mm above floor \(or ground level\) should be of safety glass. Large  
openings up to 1100 mm above floor level should be guarded to  
that level when there is a drop outside of more than 600 mm \(BS  
8213–1\: 2004\). **7-30 Materials**

*granted by the British Standards Institute.*  
WERs are an established measure of window energy efficiency.  
A formula combines the elements of solar heat transmittance,  
*U-*value and air infiltration to produce an overall rating on the A++  
to E scale, with A++ the most energy efficient for the whole win-  
dow unit. Standard building practice effectively requires windows  
with a minimum rating of C, but many manufacturers are produc-  
ing windows that are A++, A+, A or B rated and increasingly these  
will be demanded.  
# 17.2 Doors  
The majority of UK doors are manufactured to imperial dimen-  
sions, but the imperial sizes are also quoted in metric units.  
Standard imperial sizes for internal doors are 1981 mm × 457, 533,  
610, 686, 762, 838 and 864 mm. The metric sizes for internal doors  
are 2040 mm × 526, 626, 726, 826 and 926 mm. Standard thick-  
nesses are 35 and 40 mm.  
Fire doors, typically 35, 44 or 54 mm thick, are rated either to  
BS 476–22\: 1987 \(e.g. FD 30\) or to the standard BS EN 13501–2\:  
2016 \(e.g. E30\) for integrity in minutes. The ratings are normally  
subject to the use of appropriate frames with intumescent strips  
and any fire-resistant glazing being factory-fitted. In certain loca-  
tions, the Building Regulations Part E, related to the passage of  
sound, require minimum sound reduction criteria, and these can be  
achieved by the use of appropriately sealed doorsets.  
The standard imperial sizes for external inward opening doors  
are 1981 mm × 686, 762, 813, 838 and 914 mm. The correspond-  
ing frame sizes are 2081 mm × 783, 859, 910, 935 and 1011 mm.  
Additionally, a taller 2032 mm × 813 mm door is standard, matched  
to a 2132 mm × 910 mm frame.  
The standard metric size for external doors is 2000 mm × 807  
mm with a frame size of 2100 mm × 900 mm with a sill, or 2053  
mm × 900 mm without a sill. The larger 2040 mm × 826 mm metric  
doors require a 2140 mm × 920 mm frame with a sill, or 2093 mm ×  
920 mm without a sill.  
The Building Regulations Part M 2015 \(incorporating 2016  
amendments\) require a wheelchair access into buildings, prefera-  
bly level but with any threshold no higher than 15 mm and any  
upstands over 5 mm chamfered or rounded. Normally the mini-  
mum effective clear entrance width required is 800 mm in new  
buildings, but 1000 mm in buildings used by the general public.  
Visibility zones are required in doors or side panels between 500  
mm and 1500 mm from floor level. The height for door controls to  
be used by people in wheelchairs should be between 750 and 1000  
mm from the floor.  
Door Set Energy Ratings \(DSERs\) range from A++ to E,  
depending on U-value and air leakage. The A++ and A+ ratings  
reflect the inclusion of solar gain in the SAP calculation.  
# 17.3 Curtain walling  
Curtain walling can be used within commercial buildings or domes-  
tic properties where a large visual glazed area is required; this is  
advantageous because of the natural light it provides. If treated sen-  
sitively large glazed areas of facades can be aesthetically pleasing  
and create a contemporary, open-air look both inside and outside  
the building.  
Curtain walling is loosely defined in the standard \(BS EN  
13830\: 2015 + A1\: 2020\) as an external vertical building enclo-  
sure produced by elements mainly of timber, metal or plastic. This  
standard applies to curtain walling consisting of vertical and hori-  
zontal members, connected together and anchored to the supporting  
structure of the building and in-filled to form a lightweight space  
enclosing continuous skin, which does not take on any load-bear-  
ing characteristics of the building structure. The standard applies to  
curtain walling ranging from a vertical position to 15° from the ver-  
tical. It can include elements of sloping glazing contained within  
the curtain wall. Curtain walling terminology is defined in BS EN  
13119\: 2016.  
Curtain walling embraces many different forms of construction,  
but generally comprises one of the following\:  
• Stick construction – light carrier framework of site assembled  
components supporting prefabricated opaque and/or translucent  
infill panels  
• Unitised construction – pre-assembled interlinking storey  
height or multi-storey height modules, complete with infill  
panels  
• Spandrel construction – pre-assembled interlinking part-storey  
height modules, complete with infill panels.  
The standard specifies characteristics of curtain walling and  
provides technical information on performance requirements, test  
criteria and sequence of testing to which the product is subjected,  
in order to demonstrate conformity. Curtain walling is not a prod-  
uct which can be completed in all respects within a manufacturing  
area, but is a series of components and/or prefabricated units which  
only become a finished product when assembled together on site.  
The standard is applicable to the whole of the curtain walling,  
including the flashings, closures and copings.  
Curtain walling should be sufficiently rigid to resist wind loads  
\(BS EN 13116\: 2001\), sustain its own weight and transfer associ-  
ated loads to the building structure. It must be resistant to impact  
\(BS EN 14019\: 2016\), the transfer of heat/cold and sound, and be  
air \(BS EN 12152\: 2002\) and water tight \(BS EN 12154\: 2000\). It  
must be designed to be fire resistant, preventing the transmission  
of fire or smoke through voids and resisting external fire spread.  
Fire resistance tests for components are defined in BS EN 1364  
Parts 3 and 4\: 2014. These and other factors, such as durability,  
water vapour permeability, equipotentiality \(bonding to electrical  
earth\), seismic shock resistance, thermal shock resistance, build-  
ing thermal movement and resistance to live horizontal loads,  
must be proven by testing and calculation methods defined in the  
standards. **18 BIBLIOGRAPHY**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Thermal design  
Thermal design is concerned with the heat transfer processes that take  
place within a building, and between the building and its surround-  
ings and the external climate, Figure 8.1. It is primarily concerned  
with providing comfort and shelter for the building’s occupants and  
contents. Thermal design therefore includes consideration of\:  
• Climate  
• Building form and fabric  
• Building environmental services  
• Occupant comfort and processes contained within the building.  
It is also concerned with the energy used to provide heating, cool-  
ing and ventilation of buildings, and the local and global impact  
of energy use, especially in relation to carbon dioxide emissions.  
The thermal design should be integrated with the visual and acous-  
tic aspects of the design in order to achieve an overall satisfactory  
environmental solution.  
# 1.2 Three stages to thermal design  
*Stage 1\: internal environmental conditions for occupants*  
*or processes*  
The prime aim is to create spaces that are comfortable, healthy and  
productive for their occupants, Figure 8.2. People will spend typ-  
ically 90 per cent of their time indoors. The environments people  
live and work in must promote a good quality of life. Thermal con-  
ditions should be within acceptable comfort limits and the indoor  
air quality should be free from any harmful pollutants. Buildings  
must also provide appropriate thermal conditions for their con-  
tents, processes and for maintaining the building fabric itself. The  
required environmental conditions of all spaces should be clearly  
defined at the initial design stage in relation to the activities and  
contents of the space.  
**8.1** *Thermal design to achieve comfort for a given climatic condition. Passive design is related to building form and fabric. Active*  
*design is related to mechanical services, energy use and environmental impact. The environmental conditions must be suitable for the*  
*health and comfort of the occupants. There are a number of energy inputs associated with a building’s construction and operation*

**8.4** *Mechanical services should be designed to minimise energy*  
*use and environmental impact*  
**8.2** *Thermal comfort is influenced by air temperature, air*  
*movement, relative humidity and the surrounding radiant*  
*environment*  
**8.3** *Climatic modification can be achieved through manipulation*  
*of a building’s form and construction usually referred to as*  
*‘passive design’*  
*Stage 2\: climate modification using the building envelope*  
Buildings can be designed to interact with the external envi-  
ronment in order to benefit from the natural energy of the sun  
and wind, Figure 8.3. The envelope of the building can be used  
to ‘filter’ or ‘modify’ the external climate to provide internal  
comfort conditions for much of the year without the use of fuel.  
The heat from the sun can be used to heat spaces in winter or to  
drive air movement for ventilation and cooling through buoy-  
ancy forces. The building form and fabric can be used to control  
solar gains in summer to avoid overheating. The wind can also  
be used to provide ventilation and cooling. The fabric of the  
building can be used to insulate against heat loss or gain, and  
using thermal mass to stabilise the internal environment against  
extremes of temperatures \(hot or cold\). The form, mass, orien-  
tation and construction of the building need to be designed in  
response to the climate and specific location. This process is  
often termed ‘passive design’.  
*Stage 3\: mechanical services*  
If a building is designed to respond positively to the climate then  
its dependence on mechanical services to heat, cool and ventilate  
spaces can be minimised, Figure 8.4. However, there are few cli-  
mates in the world where mechanical systems can be eliminated  
altogether. In temperate climates such as the UK, a heating sys-  
tem will still generally be required during the winter period, and  
some buildings require mechanical cooling in summer. In hot cli-  
mates, mechanical cooling is often needed, sometimes the whole  
year round, for example, for commercial buildings. These services  
should be provided in an energy-efficient way in order to mini-  
mise energy use from fossil fuels, and to reduce the impact that  
buildings have on polluting the environment. Low and zero carbon  
sources of energy should be considered, such as renewable energy  
sources, including wind power, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bio-  
mass, combined heat and power \(CHP\), and air and ground source  
heat pumps. The mechanical systems and their controls should be  
designed to be able to respond to the specific needs of the occu-  
pants and be simple to use. Systems should be commissioned and  
recalibrated against any change of use throughout the lifetime of  
the building.  
It is important to adopt a holistic integrative approach to thermal  
design incorporating an appropriate blend of architectural \(passive  
design\) and engineering \(active design\) solutions.  
# 1.3 Energy inputs  
Thermal design is closely associated with energy use and car-  
bon dioxide emissions. However, of all the energy inputs to  
a building, Figure 8.1, it is only the energy from fossil fuel  
sources that have associated carbon dioxide emissions. There  
will be free energy from the sun, wind and external temper-  
atures that can be used to heat, cool, light and ventilate the  
building. This passive design approach uses the building’s  
envelope, form and glazing to optimise the benefits from exter-  
nal environmental conditions.  
The delivered energy is that used to provide electricity and heat  
to the environmental systems. This has traditionally been supplied  
from electricity and gas grid systems \(and oil, coal and biomass\)  
and involves the use of fossil fuels either to generate electricity or  
to produce heat. The aim of sustainable design is to replace fossil  
fuel sources of delivered energy with renewable and low and zero  
carbon energy supply systems. These may involve integrated, com-  
munity based or green energy from the grid, which is increasingly  
being decarbonised.  
The embodied energy is that associated with processed materi-  
als and products used during a building’s construction and fit-out.  
This includes the process energy to acquire natural resources and  
to produce the materials and components, and the transport energy  
associated with their production and delivery to site. As the deliv-  
ered energy is reduced through a more energy-efficient design, the  
embodied energy becomes of increasing significance. The embod-  
ied energy is closely linked with the life-cycle and environmental  
costs of raw materials and material manufacture, lifetime durability  
and end of use disposal. In sourcing a building material or com-  
ponent the embodied energy is a major factor in determining its  
sustainability. The use of local materials is favoured as transpor-  
tation energy costs are reduced. In general terms, the more highly processed a material is, the higher its embodied energy. The highest  
embodied energy is found in metals \(steel requires 75000 kWh/m3\),  
compared to building timber \(typically 1500 kWh/m3\), or those  
made from salvaged materials or local natural materials, which  
can require virtually no energy. Some natural materials, such as  
timber and hemp, can lock-in carbon, which reduces their environ-  
mental impact. Some materials may be reclaimed, or have a high  
recycled content, such as metals, although the process of recycling  
adds to their embodied energy. Sustainable design should encour-  
age construction systems that use fewer materials and produce less  
waste. Some construction types are inherently more wasteful than  
others. Standardisation, the use of less packaging and using more  
locally sourced off-site construction methods, should be encour-  
aged. Transportation of materials also plays a significant role in  
embodied energy calculations, especially where buildings are  
remotely located. Typically, the embodied energy of a house might  
be 1500 kWh/m2, while the total primary operational energy for a  
house built to Passive Haus standards will be less than 120 kWh/  
m2/year. Table I gives values of embodied energy in units of  
MJ/Kg, which can be converted to kWh/m3 by multiplying by  
\(material density/3.6\). Values of embodied energy for a specific  
material can vary depending on the process assumed in their pro-  
duction, including any recycled material. The table also gives  
corresponding values for embodied carbon.  
The activity energy is that derived from the use of the building.  
This is generally in the form of heat emitted from the processes of  
cooking, lighting, the use of small power, and the heat generated  
by the occupants themselves and the specific processes that occur  
in buildings. All these can provide a useful heat gain to the building  
in the winter, but can give rise to overheating in the summer and for  
some building types even in winter. In many countries, the energy  
use associated with occupant activities is increasing through more  
consumer electrically powered goods. Typical daily internal energy  
loads are presented later in Table XXXV.  
# 2 HEAT TRANSFER MECHANISMS  
# 2.1 Introduction  
There are four types of heat transfer that relate to thermal envi-  
ronmental design, Figure 8.5. These are conduction, convection,  
radiation and evaporation. They are described in what follows with  
examples of how they relate to building thermodynamics.  
Heat is a form of energy, measured in joules \(J\). The rate of  
energy use is termed power, which is measured in watts \(W\), where\:  
1 W = 1 J/s \(1 kW = 1000 J/s\)  
Another unit of energy is the kilowatt-hour \(kWh\), where\:  
1 kWh = 3600 J \(or 3.6 MJ\)  
The therm, which is equal to 100000 British thermal units  
\(BTU\), is approximately the energy equivalent of burning 100  
cubic feet of natural gas.  
1 therm = 29.3 kWh  
# 2.2 Conduction  
Conduction normally applies to heat transfer through solids. It  
is the transfer of heat from molecule to molecule from relatively  
warm to cool regions. The rate of heat transfer through a solid is  
dependent on its thermal conductivity, or k-value. The k-value  
is loosely related to the density of the material, Figure 8.6 \(see  
Table II\). High-density materials generally have high k-values –  
they are termed ‘good conductors’ of heat \(e.g. high-density  
concrete and metals\). Low-density materials have low k-values –  
they are termed ‘good thermal insulators’ \(e.g. mineral fibre batts  
and low-density concrete blocks\). The thermal resistance of a given

# 2.3 Convection  
Convection takes place in a fluid such as air or water. Once heated  
the fluid becomes less dense and more buoyant. Fluids are normally  
heated by conduction from a warm surface such as the hot surface  
of a panel heater in a room, or the electric element in a hot water  
cylinder. A cold surface will conduct heat from the adjacent fluid,  
thereby cooling the fluid. This will make the fluid denser and cause  
it to become less buoyant, for example, causing a downdraught of  
air from the internal surface of a cold window. For a typical room,  
the relatively warm and cool surfaces set up a series of interact-  
ing convective flow patterns. The convection movement of air in a  
room is an integral part of heating and cooling systems.  
In the example, Figure 8.7, heat is conducted from the air to  
the cooler surface of the glazing, causing a downdraught. Heat is  
conducted to the air from the warmer surface of the panel heater,  
causing an updraught. Although panel heaters are usually called  
radiators, they also provide heat \(typically 40 per cent\) through  
convection. The formula for convective heat transfer from a sur-  
face to air is\:  
*Qc* = *hcx \(ta−ts \)*  
where *Qc* = convective heat transfer \(W\)  
*hc* = convective heat transfer coefficient \(Wm−2K−1\)  
*ta* = air temperature \(°C\)  
*ts* = surface temperature \(°C\) Heat flow upwards from a horizontal surface\: *h*c = 4.3Wm−2K−1  
Heat flow downwards from a horizontal surface\: *h*c = 1.5 Wm−2K−1  
Heat flow from a vertical surface\: *h*c = 3.0Wm−2K−1  
Note\: Values of *h*c are at room temperature \(21°C\).  
# 2.4 Radiation  
Radiation is the transfer of heat from one surface to another  
without heating the air between them. Solar heat travels by radi-  
ation from the sun to the earth through the vacuum of space.  
Radiant heat is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spec-  
trum \(which includes X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared,  
microwaves and radio waves – which differ from each other by  
their wavelength and frequency\). The sun emits radiation with  
wavelengths between 0.29 and 3.0 mm, which includes the vis-  
ible spectrum \(0.38 and 0.78 mm\), Figure 8.8. The hotter the  
emitting body, the shorter the wavelength. Infrared radiation  
below a wavelength of 3.0 mm \(or 3000 nm\) is termed short-  
wave; above this, it is termed long-wave. The sun therefore emits  
most of its heat energy as short-wave radiation, while lower-tem-  
perature surfaces, such as buildings and heated surfaces, emit  
long-wave radiation.  
Glass is relatively transparent to short-wave radiation while  
opaque to long-wave radiation. This is the principle of the ‘green-  
house effect’, see Figure 8.9, which is important in ‘passive solar  
design’. The short-wave radiation from the sun passes through  
glass and warms up the internal surfaces, which in turn emit long-  
wave radiation, which is ‘trapped’ within the space. The only heat  
loss therefore takes place by conduction through the glass. A simi-  
lar effect takes place in the atmosphere, which gives rise to global  
warming. The ‘greenhouse gases’ \(including carbon dioxide and  
methane\) act like the glass in the greenhouse in letting through the  
# Thermal environment 8-5  
short-wave solar radiation but blocking the longer-wave radiation  
re-emitted by the earth’s surface.  
Solar radiation incident on solid walls will heat up the exter-  
nal wall surface, Figure 8.10. This heat is conducted into the wall  
where it may result in a rise in the internal surface temperature. The  
internal surface will then radiate long-wave radiation in proportion  
to its surface temperature and emissivity \(see Section 2.6\). Normal  
glazing is mostly transparent to ‘short-wave’ solar radiation, and  
radiative heat is transmitted directly through the glass, Figure 8.11.  
Some glass types are designed to be more absorbing in order to  
reduce the direct solar transmission \(see also Sections 5.6 to 5.13\).

# 2.5 The Stefan-Boltzmann law  
The amount of radiation emitted by a surface is related to its tem-  
perature and emissivity according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law\:  
*Qr* = \(5.673 × 10−8\) × *E × T* 4  
where *Qr* = radiation emitted by the surface  
*E =* surface emissivity  
*T =* surface temperature \(°C\)  
5.673 × 10−8 = Stefan-Boltzmann constant \(W/m2K4\)  
# 2.6 Emissivity and absorptance  
The emissivity of a surface is the amount of radiation emitted by the  
surface compared to that radiated by a matt black surface \(a ‘black  
body’\) at the same temperature. The best emitters are matt dark  
surfaces and the worst are silvered surfaces \(although they are good  
reflectors of radiation\). The emissivity of a surface varies between  
0 and 1, with most common building materials, such as bricks and  
plaster, having an emissivity of about 0.85 to 0.95. The absorptivity  
is the amount of radiation absorbed by a surface compared to that  
absorbed by a black body. For low-temperature surfaces, values for  
absorptivity and emissivity are presented in Table III.

# 2.7 Evaporation  
Evaporation takes place when a liquid such as water changes state  
to a vapour. A vapour is a mixture of gases that exerts a vapour  
pressure. The water molecules that escape from the liquid tend  
to have a higher energy content than those left behind and so the  
average energy content of the liquid is reduced, and therefore  
its temperature is also reduced. In order for evaporation to take  
place, the vapour pressure of water \(in the form of droplets or a  
wetted surface\) must be greater than the partial pressure of the  
water vapour in the surrounding atmosphere. The lower the relative  
humidity of the air, the lower its vapour pressure, and the greater  
the evaporation that will take place.  
Evaporation produces local cooling on wetted surfaces. This  
can be used to advantage in hot countries where roof ponds, cooled  
by evaporation, can be used to cool the roof construction. The tra-  
dition in some hot dry countries is to simply spray the floors of  
courtyards with water to cool the floor surface. Air passed over  
wetted surfaces is cooled and its moisture content is raised. The  
rate of evaporation increases with increased water temperature,  
reduced vapour pressure of the surrounding air, or increased air  
movement across the wetted surface.  
Condensation is the reverse of evaporation and takes place  
when air comes into contact with a relatively cold surface. The  
air adjacent to the cold surface is cooled and becomes satu-  
rated and the vapour condenses into a liquid forming droplets  
on the surface \(condensation is dealt with in more detail in  
Section 6\).  
# 2.8 Thermal capacity  
The thermal \(heat\) capacity of a material is a measure of its ability  
to store heat from the surrounding air and surfaces. Generally, the  
denser a material, the greater its capacity to store heat \(Table IV\).  
Therefore, high-density materials, such as concrete, will store  
more heat than low-density materials, such as mineral wool. The  
thermal capacity of a material \(the amount of heat stored per 1°C  
rise in temperature of the material\) can be calculated from the  
formula\:  
Thermal capacity \(J/°C\) = volume \(m3\) × density \(kg/m3\) ×  
specific heat \(J/kg.°C\)  
Dense masonry materials typically have around 100 times the  
thermal capacity of lightweight insulating materials \(Table IV\).

# 2.9 Thermal capacity and thermal response  
Lightweight buildings will respond quickly to heat gains,  
see Figure 8.12, from either internal sources \(people, lights,  
machines\) or external sources \(solar radiation, high external air  
temperatures\). They have a relatively low thermal capacity. The  
internal air will therefore warm up quickly as the mass of the  
building will have a relatively low capacity to absorb internal  
heat. They will also cool down quickly when the heat source is  
turned off, as there is little residual heat in the construction to  
retain air temperatures. They are more likely to overheat during  
warm weather and be cool during colder weather. They therefore  
require a more responsive heating/cooling system, and are more  
suited to intermittent occupancy.  
Heavyweight buildings are slower to respond to changes  
of temperature, see Figure 8.12, and therefore have the poten-  
tial to maintain a more stable internal environment. Buildings  
constructed of heavyweight materials will have a high thermal  
capacity. They will be slow to heat up, as the mass of the build-  
ing will absorb heat from the space. However, they will also be  
slow to cool down and are able to retain relatively high internal  
air temperatures between heating periods. Heavyweight buildings  
can maintain relatively cooler internal environments in warmer  
weather by absorbing peaks in heat gains. Typical cooling effects  
may be up to 3 to 5°C reduction, see Figure 8.13, in internal air  
temperature peaks due to thermal mass effects. In addition, the  
mean radiant temperature will be lower due to the lower surface  
temperatures. The use of chilled surface cooling is discussed also  
in Section 8.3.  
The thermal mass effect is related to the exposed surface area  
of material in a space and its thickness and specific heat capacity.  
Surface area is relatively more important than thickness of mate-  
rial. For example, for absorbing short-term \(diurnal\) peaks in heat  
gain, the thickness of the thermal mass layer needs only be about 5  
to 10 cm, Figure 8.13. **Thermal environment 8-7**

# 3.3 Clothing  
Clothing provides insulation against body heat loss. The insulation  
of clothing is measured in units of CLO \(1 CLO = 0.155 m2K/W;  
the units are those of thermal resistance\). Values of CLO for typical  
clothing ensembles are given in Table VI.  
# 3 THERMAL COMFORT  
# 3.1 Introduction  
The body produces heat through metabolic activities and exchanges  
heat with its surroundings by conduction, convection and radiation  
\(typically 75 per cent, termed sensible heat transfer\), and evapo-  
ration \(typically 25 per cent, termed latent heat transfer\). Thermal  
comfort is achieved when there is a balance between metabolic  
heat production and heat loss. It is mainly dependent on the ther-  
mal environmental conditions and the activity and clothing of the  
person in that environment.  
# 3.2 Metabolic activity  
The human body produces metabolic heat as a result of its muscular  
and digestive processes. It has to maintain a constant core tempera-  
ture of 37°C. If the core body temperature is reduced by more than  
about 1°C, hypothermia sets in; if it increases by more than about  
1°C, the person may suffer a heat stroke. The body must therefore  
lose the metabolic heat it generates in a controlled way. Clothing is  
one way of controlling heat loss. There are also physiological control  
mechanisms; for example, shivering when cold increases metabolic  
activity; the formation of ‘goose-pimples’ increases the body’s sur-  
face resistance to heat loss; sweating when warm increases heat loss  
by evaporation. The heat given off by a body through metabolic  
activity is measured in units of MET \(1 MET = 58.2 W/m2 of body  
surface area; the average surface area of an adult is 1.8 m2\). Typical  
values of MET for different activities are given in Table V.

# 3.4 Air temperature  
Air temperature is often taken as the main design parameter for  
thermal comfort. The CIBSE recommended range for internal air  
temperature is between 19°C and 23°C in winter and not exceeding  
27°C in summer. The air temperature gradient between head and  
feet is also important for comfort; the temperature at feet should  
generally not be less than 4°C below that at head.  
# 3.5 Radiant temperature  
Radiant temperature is a measure of the temperature of the sur-  
rounding surfaces, together with any direct radiant gains from  
high-temperature sources \(such as the sun\). The mean radiant tem-  
perature is the area-weighted average of all the surface temperatures  
in a room. If the surfaces in a space are at different temperatures,  
then the perceived radiant temperature in a space will be affected  
by the position of the person in relation to the various surfaces, with **8-8 Thermal environment**  
the closer or larger surface areas contributing more to the overall  
radiant temperature. Comfort can be affected by radiant asymme-  
try, and people are especially sensitive to warm ceilings \(a 10°C  
radiant asymmetry from a warm ceiling can give rise to 20 per  
cent comfort dissatisfaction\). The vector radiant temperature is a  
measure of the maximum difference in a room between the radiant  
temperatures from opposite directions.  
# 3.6 Relative humidity  
Relative humidity \(RH\) of a space will affect the rate of evapora-  
tion from the skin. The RH is a percentage measure of the amount  
of vapour in the air compared to the total amount of vapour the  
air can hold at that temperature. When temperatures are within the  
comfort range \(19–23°C\) the RH has little effect on comfort as long  
as it is within the range 40–70 per cent. At high air temperatures  
\(approaching average skin temperature of 34°C\), evaporation heat  
loss is important to maintain comfort. Wet bulb temperature is a  
measure of the temperature of a space using a wetted thermometer.  
A ‘dry bulb’ temperature sensor will exchange heat with the  
surrounding air by convection. A wet bulb thermometer loses addi-  
tional heat by evaporation and can be used in combination with a  
dry bulb, to obtain a measure of RH by referring to the psychro-  
metric chart, Figure 8.14. An example of the use of this is shown  
in Figure 8.15, where a dry bulb temperature \(dbt\) of 19°C and a  
wet bulb temperature \(wbt\) of 14°C indicates a relative humidity  
\(RH\) of 60 per cent.  
# 3.7 Air speed  
Air speed is a measure of the movement of air in a space. People  
begin to perceive air movement at about 0.15 m/s. Air speeds  
greater than 0.2 m/s may produce a 20 per cent and greater comfort  
dissatisfaction due to perceived draught. For most naturally ven-  
tilated spaces, the air speed will be less than 0.15 m/s, away from  
the influence of open windows and in the absence of major down-  
draughts from cold internal surfaces. For mechanically ventilated  
spaces, the air speed is generally greater than 0.15 m/s and could

be greater than 0.2 m/s in areas close to air supply devices or where  
supply air jets are deflected by downstand beams or other geomet-  
ric features of the space, and such speeds should be avoided. It  
is possible to counter draught discomfort to a certain extent by  
increasing air temperatures, as indicated in Figure 8.16.  
# 3.8 Thermal comfort\: compensation and adaption  
The perception of thermal comfort is a function of the combina-  
tion of the physical environment \(air and radiant temperature, air  
movement and RH\) and the activity and clothing level of the per-  
son. To some extent, the environmental factors are compensatory.  
For example, during cool conditions, an increase in air movement  
can be compensated for by an increase in air temperature, while  
in warm conditions, an increase in RH can be compensated for by  
an increase in air movement. People can also adapt their clothing  
levels, activity levels and posture in response to the prevailing ther-  
mal conditions. In this way, they are varying either their rate of  
metabolic heat production or their rate of body heat loss. Thermal  
indices use combinations of the comfort parameters in a compensa-  
tory way to provide a single measure of thermal comfort.  
The *resultant temperature*, sometimes called *globe tempera-*  
*ture*, can be used to give a more representative measure of comfort  
# Thermal environment 8-9  
than air temperature alone. It is a combination of air temperature  
and mean radiant temperature, in a proportion comparable to that  
of the body’s heat loss. At low air speeds \(\< 0.1 m/s\) the following  
relationship can be applied\:  
*tres* = 0.5 *t*mrt + 0.5 *t*a  
where *tres* = resultant temperature \(°C\)  
*t*mrt = mean radiant temperature \(°C\)  
*t*a = air temperature \(°C\)  
The resultant temperature can be measured at the centre of a  
black globe of 100 mm diameter \(although globes between 25 and  
150 mm will give acceptable results\).  
The *corrected effective temperature \(CET\)* relates globe tem-  
perature, wet bulb temperature and air speed. It is equivalent to the  
thermal sensation in a standard environment with still, saturated  
air for the same clothing and activity. CET can be represented in  
nomogram form as shown in Figure 8.17.  
# 3.9 PMV and PPD  
The *predicted mean vote \(PMV\)* is a measure of the average  
response from a large group of people voting on the scale shown  
here\:  
Hot +3  
Warm +2  
Slightly warm +1  
Neutral 0  
Slightly cool −1  
Cool −2  
Cold −3  
The PMV can be calculated from *Fanger’s comfort equation*, which  
combines air temperature, mean radiant temperature, RH and air  
speed together with estimates of activity and clothing levels. The  
*percentage people* *dissatisfied \(PPD\)* provides a measure of the  
percentage of people who will complain of thermal discomfort in  
**8.17** *Nomogram for estimating corrected effective temperature*  
*\(CET\)* **8-10 Thermal environment**  
relation to the PMV. This is shown graphically in Figure 8.18 and  
can be calculated from\:  
PPD = 100−95 exp\(10.03353 PMV4−0.2179 PMV2\)  
higher risk of symptoms are those in open-plan offices more than  
those in cellular ones, clerical workers more than managerial,  
women more than men, those in public sector buildings more than  
private, those in air-conditioned offices more than naturally ven-  
tilated ones, and those buildings where there is poor maintenance  
and poor operation of controls.  
The implication of PPD is that there is no condition where  
everyone will experience optimum comfort conditions. It predicts  
that for a typical occupied work place, there will always be 5 per  
cent of people who will report discomfort.  
# 3.10 Sick Building Syndrome \(SBS\)  
This is a term used to describe a set of commonly occurring symp-  
toms that affect people at their place of work, usually in office-type  
environments, and which disappear soon after they leave work.  
These symptoms include dry eyes, watery eyes, blocked nose, runny  
nose, headaches, lethargy, tight chest and difficulty with breathing.  
A typical percentage of symptom reporting for air-conditioned  
offices is shown in Figure 8.19. *The personal symptom index \(PSI\)*  
is often used as a measure of the average number of symptoms per  
person for a whole office or zone.  
Workers who report high levels of symptoms also often  
report problems associated with thermal comfort, and in gen-  
eral perceive the air quality as stale, dry and warm. Studies have  
indicated that air-conditioned buildings appear to have a higher  
level of complaint of SBS than naturally ventilated buildings.  
Possible reasons for this include cost cuts in their design, dif-  
ficulties and complexities in their maintenance and operation,  
problems associated with hygiene and cleanliness \(especially the  
air-distribution ductwork\) and low ventilation effectiveness due  
to short-circuiting between supply and extract. Workers with a  
# 3.11 Ventilation and indoor air quality  
Ventilation is required to maintain good air quality for health  
and comfort. Tables VII and VIII give recommended values for  
internal temperatures, infiltration rates and ventilation rates. The  
outside ‘fresh’ air supply rate requirement for occupants is gener-  
ally around 8 to 10 l/s/person \(although increased rates may now  
be required following COVID\). Ventilation is considered in more  
detail in Section 7.

# 4 SITE AND CLIMATE  
# 4.1 Introduction  
The site and climatic conditions have a major impact on the ther-  
mal design of a building and should be considered during the early  
stages of design. Also, the building will modify the existing cli-  
mate of the site to create a specific microclimate surrounding itself  
and affecting the microclimate of existing neighbouring buildings.  
Climate data is available for many parts of the world, often as  
hourly values compiled into a standard *Test Reference Year \(TRY\)*  
format. The climate conditions that relate directly to thermal design  
include\:  
• Solar radiation, sun path and cloud cover  
• Wind speed and direction  
• Air temperature  
• Relative humidity  
• Rainfall and driving rain index.  
# Thermal environment 8-11  
# 4.2 Solar radiation and sun path  
Solar radiation impacts on the building in three forms, Figure 8.20\:  
• Direct radiation, from the position of the sun in the sky  
• Diffuse radiation, from the whole of the visible sky  
• Reflected radiation \(*albedo*\) from adjacent surfaces.  
All three components will vary according to time of day, time of  
year and cloud cover, and how much sky is seen by the building  
depending on natural and manufactured obstructions. The solar  
path can be determined from the altitude and azimuth angles of the  
sun as in Figure 8.21. Typical values of solar radiation are given in  
Tables IX and X, and the effect of sun angle and overshadowing  
in Figure 8.22. The annual variation of possible hours of daily sun-  
shine for the UK is presented in Figure 8.23.

The largest component of solar radiation is the direct radiation,  
but the reflected radiation can be significant where there are hard  
light-coloured reflective surfaces adjacent to the building, either  
from the built form itself or from existing buildings and landscap-  
ing. Table XI contains data on reflected radiation for different  
surfaces \(the solar absorption of a surface is 1 − reflectance\).  
Cloud cover is measured in octals on a scale of 0 to 8, with 0  
being completely cloudless and 8 completely overcast. The diffuse

# 4.4 Sol-air temperature  
When solar energy is absorbed by an external wall, it has the same  
effect, in relation to heat loss, as a rise in external air temperature.  
The sol-air temperature is the external air temperature which, in the  
absence of solar radiation, would give rise to the same heat trans-  
fer through the wall as takes place with the actual combination of  
external temperature and incident solar radiation\:

Table IX. Cloudiness \(C\) is a measure of the proportion of cloud in  
the sky. C is 0 for a clear sky and 1 for an overcast sky.  
# 4.3 External air temperature  
The external air temperature will affect the rate of transmission and  
convective heat loss from a building. It will typically vary over a  
24-hour period \(the diurnal variation\) and over a year \(seasonal  
variation\). It will also vary with location. Table XII presents the  
average monthly external air temperature for different locations  
within the UK. Figure 8.24 shows the typical diurnal temperature  
variations for southern England.

# 4.5 External relative humidity  
The external RH will vary with external air temperature and mois-  
ture content of the air. During periods of warmer weather, the  
RH may be relatively low due to the higher external air temper-  
atures, although at night it will rise as the air temperature falls,  
Figure 8.25. During cold weather, the external RH can rise typ-  
ically to over 90 per cent. Figure 8.26 presents seasonal average  
RH values for the UK.

some constructions, causing a reduction in thermal resistance. In  
areas of high incidence of driving rain, care must be taken to select  
constructions that provide protection against rain penetration.  
# 4.7 Wind  
The impact of wind on a building has two main consequences for  
thermal design. It affects the convective heat loss at the external  
surfaces, as well as the ventilation and infiltration rate and the asso-  
ciated heat loss.  
# 4.8 Wind speed and direction  
Wind speed is measured in m/s or sometimes in knots, where 1  
knot equals 0.4 m/s. Wind direction is usually measured at eight  
points of the compass or, when required in more detail, in degrees  
clockwise from south. The wind speed and direction can be repre-  
sented by a *wind rose*, see Figure 8.27, which indicates the relative  
frequency and speed of wind from different directions.  
It is often useful to know the average temperatures associated  
with each wind direction, Figure 8.28. For example, for a specific  
location, the main prevailing wind may have relatively warmer  
temperatures, whereas a less frequent wind direction might have  
cold temperatures and give rise to greater problems.  
Wind speed increases with height due to the frictional drag of  
the ground. The profile of variation with height is called the *bound-*  
*ary layer*, and it will vary from town to open country locations, as  
shown in Figure 8.29, and according to the relationship\:  
*v*/*vr* = *kH*a  
where *v* = mean wind speed \(m/s\) at height *H* \(m\)  
*vr* = mean wind speed \(m/s\) at height 10 m  
values of *k* and *a* are from Table XIII.  
**8.26** *Seasonal average daily RH values for the UK*  
# 4.6 Rainfall and driving rain index  
Rainfall can affect thermal performance. If an external surface is  
wet, then it will lose heat by evaporation and this will reduce the  
external surface temperature, sometimes to below air temperature,  
increasing heat loss. Wind-driven rain \(‘driving rain’\) can penetrate

**8.30** *Wind pressure over a building envelope*  
**8.28** *Wind rose with temperature*  
on the leeward and sides of the building. The pressure coefficient is  
the relative pressure at a specific location on the building, and it can  
be used to calculate the actual dynamic pressure for a given wind  
speed and air density.

*v* = wind speed \(m/s\) at a reference height, *h* \(m\)  
*C*p *=* pressure coefficient measured with reference to the wind  
speed at the height *h*.  
The pressure coefficients vary across the building’s external sur-  
face, as shown in the example in Figure 8.31. A scale model of the  
building can be placed in a wind tunnel to predict *C*ps. Building  
form and the proximity to neighbouring buildings are the main  
determinants of pressure distribution for a given wind direction.  
Openings can be located to produce the required ‘cross-ventila-  
tion’, as indicated in Figure 8.32.  
# 4.11 External sheltered areas  
There are ‘rules of thumb’ which can be applied to estimate the  
impact of wind on buildings, in relation to creating external shel-  
tered areas between buildings and in courtyards, as shown in  
Figure 8.33. In general, the distances between buildings should be  
less than about 3.5 times the building height, in order to create shel-  
ter from the prevailing wind.

# 4.9 Dynamic and static wind pressures  
The static pressure \(*Ps*\) of the air is the pressure in the free-flowing  
air stream \(as shown on the isobars of a weather map\). Differences  
in static pressure arise from global thermal effects and cause wind  
flow. The dynamic pressure \(*Pd*\) is the pressure exerted when  
the wind comes into contact with an object such as a building,  
Figure 8.30. The total or stagnation pressure \(*Pt*\) is the sum of the  
static and dynamic pressures \(*Pt* = *Ps* + *Pd*\). In most cases, *Ps* can be  
ignored in thermal design, as it is usual to deal with pressure dif-  
ferences across a building, i.e. the difference in *Pd* w. The dynamic  
wind pressure is related to the air density \(*ρ*\) and the square of the  
wind speed \(*v*\)\:  
*Pd* = 0.5 ρ*v*2 \(Pa\)  
# 4.10 Pressure coefficients  
The impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive  
pressure on the windward side of a building and negative pressure  
**8.31** *Pressure coefficients can be manipulated by the form of the*  
*building\: a\) pressure distribution; b\) section; c\) plan* **Thermal environment 8-15**  
**8.32** *Typical wind flow pattern around a high-rise building*  
**8.34** *Barriers and their effect on wind flow\: a\) dense barrier; b\)*  
*medium barrier; c\) loose barrier*  
**8.33** *Building spacing and provision of sheltered external spaces*  
Barriers can be used to reduce wind speed and create external  
sheltered areas. Porous barriers are often more suitable than ‘hard’  
barriers as they reduce wind speed and do not induce counter wind  
flow areas as shown in Figure 8.34. High wind conditions can be  
created by downdraughts from tall buildings \(as in Figure 8.30\),  
wind ‘canyons’ or acceleration around corners, Figure 8.35.  
# 4.12 Site analysis  
An overall site analysis should identify the prevailing wind, the  
seasonal sun paths and existing shelter and obstructions, well as  
other aspects, such as noise sources and views.  
# 4.13 Global warming  
It is now generally accepted that there will be global warming  
based on the past emission of greenhouse gases. The current pre-  
dicted average temperature rise due to global warming for the UK  
is around 2°C by the middle of this century, and between 3°C and  
6°C by the end of the century. By 2080, degree days are predicted  
**8.35** *Localised high wind speeds can be caused by ‘canyon’*  
*effects and acceleration around corners*  
to fall by about between 25 to 40 per cent from north UK down to  
London respectively, and since the early 1980s until now, there has  
already been a 10 per cent reduction. Buildings should therefore  
be designed to respond to future weather data rather than histor-  
ical data and there is now future weather data available through  
CIBSE. The thermal design will likely be affected by increases in  
temperature and increases in extreme events of wind and rain. In  
some countries, there may be untypical cooler periods; for exam-  
ple, in the hotter places where heating was not required there may  
be the need in future, while in more temperate climates cooling  
may become more an issue. The predicted increase in summer **8-16 Thermal environment**  
temperatures in temperate climates might lead to the adoption of a 1 Calculate the resistance of the individual layers of the construc-  
heavyweight construction with ventilation night cooling or ground tion \(see Section 2 and refer to *k*-values in Table I\).  
cooling. There should be more attention to shading and microcli-  
mate design to reduce heat gains. There is therefore the need to *R1,2,3* . . . *= x/k*  
adopt an adaptive approach to design to allow for future climate  
change, as well as a mitigating approach to reduce carbon dioxide where *R1,2,3* . . . = thermal resistance of element 1, 2, 3 . . .

# 5 BUILDING FABRIC 5.1 U-values  
The U-value of the wall, roof or floor element of a building can be Select the appropriate values for the internal and external sur-  
used to provide an estimate of its heat loss \(or gain\). The U-values face resistances \(*Rsi* and *Rse*\) by referring to Tables XV and XVI.  
of typical construction types are given in Table XIV. The U-value of 2 Select the appropriate resistance of any air cavities \(Rcav\) by  
a wall construction can be calculated using the following procedure\: referring to Table XVII.  
**Table XIV U-values of typical construction types** 3 Calculate the total thermal resistance \(Rtotal\) of the wall using  
the following formula\:  
Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3+ . . . + *Rsi* + *Rse* + *Rcav*  
4 Calculate the U-value, that is, the conductance, of the wall using  
the following formula\:  
U-value = 1/Rtotal  
The heat loss \(*Qf \(W\)*\) associated with an element of the construc-  
tion of area \(A \(m2\)\) and with a temperature difference \(DT \(°C\)\)  
across it can be estimated as follows\:  
*Qf* = *U* × A × DT

*U-value calculation*  
Calculate the U-value of the insulated cavity wall construction  
shown in Figure 8.36 for a normal exposure site. Estimate the rate  
of heat loss through 10 m2 of the fabric for a 20°C temperature  
difference across the wall.  
The resistance is calculated in Table XVIII, giving a total resist-  
ance of 3.57 m2K/W.  
Hence the U-value = 1/3.57 = 0.28 W/m2K  
and the heat loss, *Q*t *=* 0.28 × 10 × 20 = 56 W  
# 5.2 Thermal insulation  
A high standard of thermal insulation in buildings in a temperate  
climate such as in the UK has the following benefits\:  
1 It reduces the rate of heat loss, and therefore buildings use less  
energy to maintain comfortable internal thermal conditions.  
# Thermal environment 8-17

Total – – 3.57  
This also means that people are more able to afford to heat their  
buildings to comfortable conditions, and  
2 It raises internal surface temperatures and therefore reduces the  
risk of surface condensation.  
# 5.3 Types of insulation  
Most thermal insulating materials have k-values of 0.03–0.04 W/  
mK. The most common types are\:  
• Mineral fibre – this can be glass fibre or rock fibre and is avail-  
able in lower-density roll form or higher-density batt form. The  
roll form is usually used to insulate roofs, while the batt form  
is often used in walls where, because of its greater rigidity, it  
is more appropriate to vertical fixing. Mineral fibre insulation  
forms a good attachment to the inner skin of the construction,  
leaving no air gap. It is often used in wall and roof industrial  
cladding type constructions. Mineral fibre may also be in a loose  
form that can be ‘blown’ into a cavity, to ‘cavity fill’ an existing  
or new construction.  
• Rigid board – this is usually made from foamed plastic or foamed  
glass. It can be gas-filled to give lower k-values, although boards  
which use ozone-depleting gases should be avoided. If rigid board  
insulation is used, it is essential to achieve a good attachment to  
the inner skin of the construction to avoid airflow between the  
inner skin and the insulation layer, which will detract from its  
U-value performance. The cavity should be kept clean and mor-  
tar ‘snobs’ and other sources of protuberance and blockage on  
the inner skin should be eliminated before the insulation is fixed.  
Rigid board insulation is often used in composite ‘factory made’  
cladding system constructions, where it is bonded between two  
layers of metal sheeting. It may also be used in SIPS \(structurally  
insulated panel systems\).  
• Blown insulation cavity fill, including mineral or cellulose fibres  
or plastic granules. Insulation is blown into the cavity after  
completion of construction. Care is needed in installing blown  
insulation in order to avoid any voids in the insulation in areas  
where the insulation has difficulty in penetrating, for example  
blocked areas of the cavity. This method of cavity insulation  
has the advantage that it can be applied to existing construc-  
tions. Recycled paper insulation, for example, produced from **8-18 Thermal environment**  
100 per cent recycled newspaper, has low embodied energy  
compared to most other insulation materials.  
• Low-density concrete blocks. Blocks with densities down to 600  
kg/m3 provide thermal insulation with k-values of 0.2 W/m-K.  
Such blocks are normally 210 mm in thickness and are used for  
the inner skin of a construction; this may be an infill panel or a  
loadbearing wall. They contribute to the thermal insulation of  
cavity construction, especially when the cavity needs to be left  
empty for weather resistance in exposed locations. However,  
additional insulation materials will be needed to bring the overall  
insulation level to the required standard. Lightweight blockwork  
requires sufficient expansion joints to avoid cracking.  
# 5.4 Thermal bridging  
Thermal bridging takes place through the details of a construction  
that have relatively low thermal resistance to heat flow; they have  
a high U-value in comparison with the rest of the construction.  
Common areas of thermal bridging are around windows, doors and  
structural elements. Heat will flow from high to low temperatures by  
conduction along the path of ‘least thermal resistance’. In the case  
of jambs, sills, lintels and floor edges, the least resistance path will  
generally be along the highly conductive materials such as metal and  
dense concrete. Heat loss at thermal bridges can be reduced by add-  
ing insulation and thermal breaks, and ensuring that the insulation is  
continuous over the building envelope. If thermal bridging occurs, it  
will result in increased heat loss and increased risk of condensation.  
There are two types of thermal bridging, non-repeating and  
repeating. The heat loss through solid ground floors is a specific  
case of a non-repeating thermal bridge where heat will follow  
the three-dimensional line of least thermal resistance as shown in  
Figure 8.37. Where there are structural elements such as timber  
joists in ceilings, these are repeating thermal bridges, Figure 8.38.  
The heat loss due to repeating thermal bridging can be included in  
a standard U-value calculation using the ‘combined method’. The heat  
loss at a non-repeating thermal bridge can be estimated from its thermal  
transmittance, or psi \(ψ\) value. This is defined as the rate of heat flow  
per degree temperature difference per unit length of a thermal bridge,  
**8.37** *The edge losses are dominant in floor heat loss*  
**8.38** *Increase in heat loss through repeating thermal bridging*  
*due to structural elements*  
measured in W/mK. ψ values can be obtained from measurement or  
from detailed calculations. If the ψ value is known \(Table XIX\), the  
heat loss, HTB \(W/K\) through a thermal bridge can be estimated using,  
HTB = *l* × ψ  
where *l* = length of the thermal bridge in metres.  
**Table XIX** **Common ψ values**

Corner \(normal\) 0.09  
Corner \(inverted\) −0.09  
Source\: SAP 2009  
This must then be added to the elemental heat loss for the wall,  
roof or floor.  
# 5.5 Installation of insulation  
The following guidelines should be followed when designing an  
insulated construction.  
Insulation should always be located on the ‘warm and dry  
side’ of a ventilated cavity \(unless informed otherwise, it is usual  
to assume that all cavities are ventilated\). If a cavity or air gap is  
ventilated on the warm side of the insulation, this could provide a  
‘short circuit’ for heat loss as indicated in Figure 8.39.  
Avoid air infiltration through or around the insulation material  
as indicated in Figure 8.40. This will result in short-circuiting of  
heat loss. Ensure continuity of insulation at design details, e.g.  
eaves and floor junctions.  
**8.39** *Insulation should not be placed on the cold side of a ventilated*  
*cavity, as its insulation value will be considerably reduced*  
**8.40** *Mortar snobs may distance the insulation from the inner*  
*skin introducing airflow on the warm side of the insulation and*  
*short-circuiting the heat flow through convective losses* **Thermal environment 8-19**  
performance glazing systems can produce double glazing U-values  
down to 1.1 W/m2K, and triple glazing down to 0.5 to 0.7 W/m2K.  
If a vapour barrier is used, it should be applied to the warm side  
of the insulation to guard against condensation and degrading of  
the insulation properties through dampness.  
Avoid compression of low-density insulation when installed in  
a construction.  
# 5.6 Glazing  
Glass is the main material used for glazing. It is available in a wide  
range of configurations with different thermal properties.  
# 5.7 Thermal performance of glass  
Glass is transparent to short-wave infrared radiation and opaque to  
long-wave radiation \(see Section 2.4\). It is also a good conductor  
of heat. Although glass transmits the short-wave infrared part of the  
solar radiation spectrum, it will also reflect and absorb a proportion  
of the radiation as shown in Figure 8.41, the amount of which will  
vary with solar angle of incidence.  
# 5.8 U-Value of glass  
The thermal resistance for a single layer of glass can mainly be  
attributed to the surface resistances. The glass material itself has  
practically no thermal resistance.  
# Example 3  
*Calculate the U-value of a single layer of glass*  
Internal surface resistance is 0.13; External surface resistance is  
0.04.  
For a *k*-value of glass of 1.05 and thickness of 6 mm, the resist-  
ance can be calculated\:  
R= 0.13 + 0.006/1.05 + 0.04  
Total resistance \(R\) = 0.1757 m2K/W  
U-value is 1/R = 5.7 W/m2K  
Adding layers of glass will improve the insulating properties of  
glazing due to the resistance of the trapped layer of air \(or another gas\).  
The thermal resistance of an air- or gas-filled cavity increases in pro-  
portion to its width up to about 20 mm and remains constant up to 60  
mm, after which it decreases slightly. Increasing the layers of glass will  
reduce the solar transmittance by about 80 per cent per layer for clear  
glass. The glazing frame can produce a thermal bridge, which will  
increase the overall U-value of the glazing system, and be a significant  
component of heat loss for more insulated glazing systems. Typical  
U-values of glazing systems are presented in Table XX, although high

# 5.9 Low-emissivity glass  
A coating of metal oxide can be applied to a glass surface to reduce  
its emissivity. This will reduce its long-wave radiation loss, which  
will reduce the overall transmission loss by about 30 per cent. The  
low-emissivity coating is usually applied to the inside surface of  
the inner pane of a double-glazed unit.

The G-value of a glazing system is a measure of the total solar gains  
to a space, which includes the direct ‘short-wave’ transmitted gains  
through the glass and the secondary gains through the heated inter-  
nal glass surface due to absorption of solar gains within the glazing  
system, Figure 8.42 \(also refer to the value F in Figure 8.41\). The  
direct gains themselves will be absorbed by internal surfaces and  
the subsequent rise in surface temperature will result in convective  
and radiant gains to the space. The transmission of solar radiation  
through windows can be reduced by different glazing treatments,  
or the use of blinds or solar shading. Blinds can be incorporated  
within a layered glazing system to provide additional solar control,  
Figure 8.43. Internal blinds convert short-wave radiant heat gains  
to convective and long-wave radiant heat gains. Blinds located  
externally or between layers of glass are more effective in reducing  
solar heat gains. In some cases it may be necessary to ventilate  
the cavity that contains the blinds, otherwise the solar heat gains  
‘trapped’ within the glazing system may give rise to secondary heat  
gains through the heated internal glass surface. As a rule of thumb,  
the internal glass surface temperature should be no more than 5°C  
above the internal air temperature to avoid excess secondary heat  
gains and thermal discomfort near the glazing zone.

# 5.11 Layered glazing systems  
In recent years, there has been an increase in layered glazing sys-  
tems in buildings allowing large areas of glazing to maximise  
daylight and for architectural aesthetics, while provided good ther-  
mal insulation and solar control. Solar control is often achieved  
by a combination on glazing treatment and blinds, resulting in  
G-values below 0.15 \(Table XXI\).  
# Table XX1 Solar control system  
Source\: Mylona, A. 2007. *Modelling the Thermal Performance of Complex Glazing*  
*Systems*. Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University  
There is a range of options for blinds. Louvre type ‘venetian’  
blinds can be controlled in terms of their opening angle and this  
will affect their G-value as well as where they are positioned  
within the glazing system. Material ‘roller’ blinds can reflect,  
absorb and transmit solar radiation according to their colour  
and materiality. In some cases, external blinds are made of dif-  
fuse glass, which reflects sunlight while allowing daylight to  
enter.  
# 5.12 Matrix glazing systems  
Matrix glazing systems are designed to make maximum use of day-  
light, while at the same time controlling solar heat gain. They may  
consist of a reflective matrix located between two layers of glass.  
The blades of the reflector are angled to respond to the particular  
orientation of the glass and the requirement for accepting or reject-  
ing the solar heat gains, Figure 8.44.  
# 5.13 Transparent Insulation Material \(TIM\)  
This can be applied to the face of an opaque south-facing façade  
to provide insulation while at the same time allowing the passage  
of solar gains to the solid wall behind, Figure 8.45. It can also be  
installed between two layers of glass where light but not view is  
required.  
# 6 CONDENSATION  
# 6.1 Introduction  
Condensation occurs when moist air meets a relatively cool sur-  
face. Water condenses out of the air and is deposited on the cool  
surface. It can result in dampness, surface mould growth and dete-  
rioration of the building fabric.  
**8.44** *Matrix glazing system*  
**8.45** *Transparent insulation material \(TIM\)* **6.2 Terminology**  
• The amount of water vapour that the air can contain is lim-  
ited and when this limit is reached, the air is said to be  
*saturated*.  
• The saturation point varies with temperature. The higher the  
air temperature, the greater the amount of water vapour it can  
contain.  
• Water vapour is a gas, and in a mixture of gases such as air, the  
water vapour contributes to the total vapour pressure exerted by  
the air.  
• The ratio of the vapour pressure in any mixture of water vapour  
and air to the vapour pressure of saturated air at the same temper-  
ature is the *relative humidity* \(RH\).  
• If air is cooled it will eventually reach saturation point, that is  
100 per cent RH, and any further cooling will cause the vapour  
to condense. The temperature at which condensation occurs is  
called the *dewpoint* temperature.  
# 6.3 Surface condensation  
When air with a relatively high RH comes into contact with a cold  
surface, condensation can take place. The risk of surface conden-  
sation depends on\:  
• Air and surface temperature  
• Moisture content of the air.  
# 6.4 Mould growth  
Surface condensation can cause mould growth. Mould spores can  
germinate at RHs above 80 per cent. If the RH is generally greater  
than 70 per cent for long periods mould will spread.  
# 6.5 Estimating surface temperature  
The following formula can be used to estimate the surface temper-  
ature\:  
Temperature drop between the air and the surface  
*=* Δ*T × U × R*si  
where\:  
Δ*T =* inside/outside air temperature difference °C  
*U* = wall U-value *W/m*2*K*  
*R*si*=* internal surface resistance *mK/W*  
# Example 4  
*What is the internal surface temperature of single glazing \(U-value*  
*= 5.7 W/m*2*K\), if the internal air temperature is 20°C and the exter-*  
*nal air temperature is 0°C? The internal surface resistance is 0.123*  
*mK/W*.  
DT = 20; *U* = 5.7; *R*si *=* 0.123  
Temperature drop \(air to wall surface\) = 20.0 × 5.7 × 0.123 =  
14.0°C.  
Therefore, the internal surface temperature = 20.0–14.0 = 6.0°C.  
# 6.6 Surface temperature and U-value  
The internal surface temperature is affected by the U-value of  
the construction element, Figure 8.46. The higher the U-value,  
the lower the internal surface temperature for a given heat input  
to the space. Thermal bridging constitutes a localised increase  
in U-value, which will result in a lower surface temperature.  
High U-value elements at risk include single glazing and thermal  
bridging.  
# Thermal environment 8-21  
**8.46** *Internal air-to-surface temperature versus inside/outside*  
*temperature difference for different U-values*  
# 6.7 Moisture content of the air  
Moisture is contained in the external air and this is added to by  
various building use activities \(Table XXII\). The main moisture  
sources are\:  
# Table XXII Moisture addition to internal air  
# Room type kg/kg dry air  
Dwelling 0.0034  
Offices shops, classrooms 0.0017  
Catering 0.0068  
*External air*\: external air enters the building through ventilation. Its  
RH will depend on its moisture content and temperature. For exam-  
ple, on a typical winter’s day, external air at 90 per cent RH and  
5°C will contain about 5 g/kg \(dry air\) of water vapour. Saturated  
air at 0°C will contain 3.8 g/kg. These values can be obtained from  
the psychrometric chart, Figure 8.14; see Section 3.6.  
*Drying out*\: building materials contain moisture \(Table XXIII\).  
A building could take a year to dry out after construction. A new  
house might contain 4000 litres of water, which will be released  
during the drying-out period.

Source\: CIBSE *Guide A\: Environmental Design*, 2015  
*Occupants*\: moisture is produced as a result of occupants’ activ-  
ities \(Table XXIV\). On average, 3.4 g/kg\(air\) of moisture is added  
to the air by internal activities in a house.  
# 6.8 Causes of surface condensation  
Minimising the risk of surface condensation requires a balanced  
approach to heating, ventilation and insulation, together with mini-  
mising moisture production.  
*Heating*\: inadequate heating can result in low air temperatures  
and higher levels of RH. It also means colder surface temperatures. **8-22 Thermal environment**  
**8.47** *Ventilation rate versus RH, indicating that low and high rates can give rise to higher RHs*  
Intermittent heating can result in the fabric and surface temperatures  
significantly cooler than the air temperature \(during warm up\). Warm  
moist air coming into contact with cool surfaces can then result in  
condensation. Partial heating of a house can result in warm, moist  
air convecting to cooler rooms with cooler surfaces. Surface areas  
shielded from heating \(e.g. behind wardrobes\) will be more at risk.  
*Ventilation*\: low ventilation rates will result in a build-up of mois-  
ture in the air causing higher levels of RH. Too much ventilation  
could give rise to lower internal air temperatures, which will again  
increase the RH, and also reduce surface temperatures. Ventilation  
should therefore be balanced as illustrated in Figure 8.47.

# 6.9 Estimating risk of surface condensation  
The risk of surface condensation can be estimated if the RH and air  
and surface temperatures are known.  
# Example 5  
Predict the risk of surface condensation using the psychrometric  
chart in Figure 8.48.  
• The outdoor dry bulb air temperature is 0°C and contains 3.8 g/  
kg of moisture, which gives an RH of 100 per cent \(point A\).  
• On entering the building the air warms to 20°C. If its moisture  
content remains the same, its RH will reduce to 27 per cent  
\(point B\).  
• Internal activities are assumed to generate additional moisture of  
7 g/kg, increasing the RH to 70 per cent \(point C\).  
• The dewpoint temperature for air at 70 per cent RH is 15°C  
\(point D\).  
This means that condensation will occur if the air comes into con-  
tact with a surface at a temperature of 15°C or less.  
**8.48** *Illustration to Example 5\: predicting the risk of surface*  
*condensation using a psychrometric chart*  
Referring to the graph in Figure 8.46 for an internal/external air  
temperature difference of 20°C, surface condensation will occur  
if the U-value is greater than 2 W/m2K, in which case the internal  
surface temperature will be 15°C or less, i.e. 5°C less than the air  
temperature.  
# 6.10 Interstitial condensation  
Condensation can occur within a construction. The dewpoint tem-  
perature profile of a wall can be predicted. If the actual temperature  
at any point within the construction falls below the dewpoint tem-  
perature then there is a risk of interstitial condensation taking place,  
as shown in Figure 8.49.  
# 6.11 Vapour resistance  
A material will resist the passage of vapour depending on its  
vapour resistivity or vapour resistance \(Tables XXV and XXVI\)  
\(analogous to thermal resistivity\). The vapour resistance of a given  
thickness of material within a construction is\:  
*V*r = x *× v*r  
Where\:  
*v*r = vapour resistivity \(Ns/kg.m\)  
x *=* thickness of material \(m\)  
*V*r  
*=* vapour resistance \(Ns/kg\) **8.49** *Set of three diagrammatic representations of\:*  
*A Temperature profile through wall*  
*B Dewpoint temperature profile*  
*C Overlap of these two profiles indicating area of interstitial*  
*condensation risk*  
# 6.12 Vapour pressure  
The vapour pressure can be estimated from the moisture content  
using a psychrometric chart. The dewpoint temperature for a given  
vapour pressure will be the dry bulb temperature at 100 per cent  
RH. The drop in vapour pressure across a given thickness of mate-  
rial in a construction is\:  
*dV*p*= \(V*T */V*K\) *× dV*p  
where *dV*p = drop in vapour pressure across a given thickness of  
material \(kPa\)  
*V*T *=* vapour resistance of material \(Ns/kg\)  
*V*K = vapour resistance of construction \(Ns/kg\)  
d*V*p = vapour drop across construction \(kPa\)

# 7 INFILTRATION AND VENTILATION  
# 7.1 Ventilation  
Ventilation is the process of supplying and removing air  
by natural or mechanical means to and from any space. It  
is a combination of infiltration and purpose ventilation.  
Purpose ventilation can be either natural \(opening windows\),  
or mechanical \(turning on a fan\), or a combination of each.  
Ventilation rate is measured in air changes per hour \(ac/h\), m3/s  
or litres per second per person \(1/s/p\). Typical ventilation rates  
are in Table XXVIII and more detailed rates can be found in  
Tables VII and VIII.  
# 7.2 Air infiltration  
Air infiltration is the term used to describe the fortuitous leakage  
of air through a building due to imperfections in the structure,  
such as\:  
• Cracks around doors, windows, infill panels  
• Service entries, pipes, ducts, flues, ventilators  
• Through porous constructions, bricks, blocks, mortar joints.  
# 7.3 Natural ventilation  
Natural ventilation is the movement of outdoor air into a space  
through intentionally provided openings, such as windows, doors  
and non-powered ventilators. This is in addition to the ventilation  
due to air infiltration. In many cases, for much of the year infil-  
tration alone will provide sufficient outdoor air to ventilate the  
building. However, it is uncontrollable and, if excessive, can incur  
a high-energy penalty and/or make the building difficult to heat \(or  
cool\) to comfort levels. **8-24 Thermal environment**

# 7.4 Mechanical ventilation  
Mechanical ventilation is the movement of air by mechanical  
means to and/or from a space. It can be localised using individual  
wall or roof fans, or centralised with ducted distribution. It is con-  
trollable and can, for example, incorporate a heat-recovery system  
to extract heat from exhaust air and use it to pre-heat supply air.  
# 7.5 Build tight, ventilate right!  
Infiltration is present in both naturally ventilated and mechanically  
ventilated spaces. It is considered ‘best practice’ to reduce the infil-  
tration as much as possible by sealing measures, and then to depend  
on controllable natural or mechanical means to provide the main  
ventilation.  
# 7.6 Ventilation effectiveness and efficiency  
The term *ventilation effectiveness* is used to describe the fraction  
of fresh air delivered to the space that reaches the occupied zone.  
It should ideally be 100 per cent. However, if air ‘short-circuits’  
between supply and extract points then it could be greatly reduced,  
down to as low as 50 per cent, Figure 8.51.  
The term *ventilation efficiency* is used to describe the ability of  
a ventilation system to exhaust the pollutants generated within the  
space. For a specific pollutant, it is the mean concentration level of  
the pollutant throughout the space in relation to its concentration at  
the point of extract. The ventilation efficiency at a single location  
is the ratio of pollutant concentration at that location in the space to  
its concentration at the point of extract.  
Ventilation efficiency *E =* \(\(*Ce* – *Cs*\)/\(*Co*−*Cs*\)\) × *100*  
where *E =* ventilation efficiency  
*Ce* = concentration of pollutant in extract  
*Cs* = concentration of pollutant in air supply  
*Co* = concentration of pollutant at occupant location  
If there is a significant level of the pollutant in the supply air, then  
this should be subtracted from the internal and exhaust concentra-  
tion levels.  
# 7.7 Metabolic carbon dioxide as an indicator of air  
# quality  
Metabolic carbon dioxide is often used as an indicator of air qual-  
ity. For naturally ventilated spaces in winter when windows are  
closed, the carbon dioxide level may rise to typically 1,500 ppm  
for offices, and 2,500 ppm for school classrooms. For mechanically  
ventilated buildings, the carbon dioxide level should not rise above  
1,000 ppm and will generally be less than 800 ppm. Metabolic  
carbon dioxide can also be used to estimate ventilation efficiency  
using the formula in section 7.6.  
# 7.8 Ventilation heat loss  
The air supplied to a space has to be heated in winter and some-  
times cooled in summer. For a mechanical ventilation system, this  
is achieved by pre-heating or cooling the air before it is delivered to  
the space. For natural ventilation, it is usually achieved by incom-  
ing fresh air mixing with air already in the space and then this  
mixture is heated by the heating system, for example by contact  
with ‘radiator’ surfaces. The air that is exhausted from the space,  
through natural or mechanical means, contains heat energy. For a  
mechanical ventilation system, this heat is sometimes recovered  
through a heat exchanger – otherwise it is wasted. The ventilation  
component of heat loss can be a significant and sometimes major  
proportion of the total building heat loss. It can also be very vari-  
able, especially in naturally ventilated buildings, as it depends on  
external wind velocity and air temperature.  
The heat lost or gained through ventilation can be estimated  
from\:  
*Qv* = *V*a × volume × Δ*T* × *C*ρ/3600  
or  
**8.51** *Short-circuiting of air between supply and extract reduces*  
*ventilation effectiveness and efficiency*  
*Qv* = *V1* × number of people × Δ*T* × *C*ρ/1000  
where *Qv* = heat loss or gain in watts  
*V*a = ventilation rate in air changes per hour \(ac/h\)  
*V1* = ventilation rate in litres per second per person \(1/s/p\)  
*Cρ* = volumetric heat capacity of air = 1200 J/m3K  
Δ*T =* internal/external air temperature difference \(°C\). An increase in internal/external temperature difference causes  
an increase in ventilation rate and an increase in heat loss or gain.  
When designing a heating system, the ventilation rate used to  
calculate the design heat loss should correspond to a design ventila-  
tion rate. However, when estimating seasonal energy performance,  
the ventilation rate will be the average ventilation rate over a heat-  
ing season.  
# 7.9 Natural ventilation design  
Natural ventilation through leakage and purpose ventilation is a  
result of two processes, termed *stack effect* and *wind effect*.  
# 7.10 Stack effect  
Stack effect occurs when there is a difference between the inside  
and outside air temperatures. If the inside air temperature is warmer  
than the outside air it will be less dense and more buoyant. It will  
rise through the space escaping at high level through cracks and  
openings. It will be replaced by cooler, denser air drawn into the  
space at low level. Stack effect increases with increasing inside/  
outside temperature difference and increasing height between the  
higher and lower openings. The neutral plane, Figure 8.52, occurs  
at the location between the high and low openings at which the  
internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure \(in the  
absence of wind\). Above the neutral plane, the air pressure will be  
positive relative to the neutral plane and air will exhaust. Below  
the neutral plane, the air pressure will be negative and external air  
will be drawn into the space. The pressure difference due to stack  
is estimated from\:  
*P*s *= −*ρ *× T × g × h ×* \(*1/Te −1/Ti*\)  
Where\:  
*Ps* = pressure difference in pascals \(Pa\)  
ρ = density of air at temperature *T*  
*g =* acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s2  
*h =* height between openings \(m\)  
*Ti* = inside temperature in Kelvin  
*Te* = external temperature in Kelvin, and  
*T =* average temperature in Kelvin \(Te+Ti\)/2.  
# 7.11 Wind effect  
Wind effect ventilation, sometimes referred to as *cross-ventila-*  
*tion*, is caused by the pressure differences on openings across a  
space due to the impact of wind on the external building envelope,  
Figure 8.53. Pressure differences will vary, depending on wind  
**8.52** *Pressure gradient due to stack effect, indicating the location*  
*of the neutral plane*  
# Thermal environment 8-25  
**8.53** *Wind-driven cross-ventilation*  
speed and direction, and location of the openings in the envelope.  
The pressure at any point on a building envelope can be calculated  
for a given wind speed and direction if the pressure coefficient at  
the point is known \(see Section 4.10\). Pressure coefficients are  
usually derived from wind tunnel tests. The pressure difference  
between two locations on a building’s envelope due to wind can  
be estimated from\:  
*P= 0.5*ρv2\(*Cp*1 − *Cp*2\)  
where *Pw* = pressure difference across the building \(Pa\)  
*Cp1* and *Cp2* = pressure coefficients at the two locations on the  
building’s external envelope in relation to the wind speed \(*v*\) and  
air density \(ρ\).  
# 7.12 Natural ventilation strategies  
Figure 8.54 presents a range of natural ventilation strategies  
with depths limits for single-sided and cross-ventilated spaces.  
Figure 8.55 illustrates *passive stack ventilation \(PSV\)* applied to  
domestic buildings, although this system is rarely used today.  
# 8 HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS  
# 8.1 Introduction  
The purpose of heating systems is to maintain internal air and  
radiant temperatures within the comfort zone. During the ‘heating  
season’, a building will lose heat through the fabric and through  
air infiltration and ventilation. However, a building will also gain  
heat from internal sources \(cooking, electric power and people\) and  
from external solar heat gains through areas of glazing. A heat-  
ing system is required to make up the difference between the heat  
gains and the heat losses. If a building is well insulated, has a low  
air infiltration rate and controlled ventilation then during the heat-  
ing season, after some initial ‘warm up’ period, it may be heated  
entirely from the incidental heat gains. A heating system should  
be sized and controlled such that it can provide the appropriate  
amount of heat input when needed in an efficient and effective way.  
# 8.2 Types of heating systems  
There are direct and indirect heating systems. Direct systems are  
located in the space, and include solid fuel fires, gas fires, direct  
electric panel heaters and electric storage heaters. For industrial  
applications, there are high-temperature gas-fired radiant tubes and  
plaques. The main types of indirect systems are wet central heating  
systems, Figure 8.56, and ducted warm air systems, Figure 8.57.  
There are also low-temperature ‘surface’ heating systems such as  
underfloor heating, and ceiling and wall systems, where heating \(or  
cooling\) is input via the building’s internal surface or mass. **8-26 Thermal environment**

*an expansion vessel \(dotted circuit\); or in the past it may have been gravity fed, in which case it requires a header tank located above*  
*the top radiator* **8.3 Heat distribution**  
Heat can be distributed in water or in air. As water has a higher  
specific heat capacity than air, it requires smaller pipes in compar-  
ison to air ducts for the same heat transfer \(Table XXIX\). Water  
distribution can be ‘gravity’ fed or pressurised. An open system  
will require a header tank, whereas a pressurised system is sealed  
and requires a pressurisation unit. Pressurised systems can be used  
to carry water at temperatures higher than 100°C, and are generally  
used for commercial and industrial systems.  
# 8.4 Heat emitters  
Surface panel or tube heaters emit heat by a mixture of con-  
vection and radiation. The balance changes with surface  
temperature and finish \(see Table XXX\). In some cases, the  
convective heat component may not be useful, as for overhead  
industrial localised heating systems. Some emitters, for exam-  
ple electric storage heaters, use a combination of heated surface  
plus forced convection.  
# 8.5 Boilers  
Boilers convert fuel to heat. In doing so they produce products  
of combustion, which must be flued. The boiler efficiency \(see  
Table XXXI\) is a measure of the conversion of the energy in the

fuel \(its calorific value\) to the useful heat extracted. Condensing  
boilers are also able to recover latent heat from the flue gases and  
therefore have a higher efficiency. Boiler efficiency is usually  
reduced at part-load operation. In larger buildings, modular boilers  
allow maximum efficiency with sequencing a number of smaller  
boilers instead of a few large ones so that the majority operate at  
full-load. Domestic combination boilers allow for direct heating of  
domestic hot water, thus avoiding the need for storage and reducing  
the standing heat losses.  
# 8.6 Distribution losses  
There will be heat loss associated with the distribution system.  
Pipes and ducts should be well insulated \(Table XXXII\). There will  
also be standing ‘case’ heat losses associated with the boiler, which  
may be considered useful \(although it is uncontrolled\) if they con-  
tribute to space heating.  
# 8.7 Building ‘design heat loss’  
Fabric and ventilation heat loss has been explained in Sections 5  
and 6. The *design heat loss* of a building is its heating demand for  
a given external air temperature, which will vary for different parts  
of the UK. It can be estimated as follows\:  
Fabric heat loss rate\: *Q*f \(W/°C\)  
Ventilation heat loss rate\: *Q*v \(W/°C\)  
Total heat loss rate\: *Q* = *Q*f +*Q*v \(W/°C\)  
Design internal air temperature\: *T*i \(°C\)  
Design external air temperature\: *T*e \(°C\)  
Design heat loss = *Q* × \(*T*i−*T*e\) \(*W*\)  
# 8.8 Seasonal energy use  
The seasonal energy use can be calculated from the design heat  
loss, but using some form of seasonal temperature instead of a  
design temperature. Also, an allowance has to be made for system  
efficiency and incidental heat gains. The seasonal temperature can  
be in the form of a heating season average temperature or *degree*  
*days* \(Table XXXIII\). If average temperature is used, then some  
account of seasonal heat gains is required. Degree days already  
assume some level of useful heat gains in relation to a *base temper-*  
*ature*, which is the temperature below which heating is required.  
The standard base temperature is 15.5°C, which takes account of  
typical internal heat gains.  
# 8.9 Heat gains  
There will be heat gains from internal activities and solar effects  
\(Table XXXIV\). For domestic buildings, the internal gains can  
be estimated depending on whether the household has high,  
medium or low activities \(Table XXXV\). Not all the internal  
gains will usefully supplement the heating. Some may cause  
overheating and some may occur where or when they are not  
required.  
# 8.10 Environmental temperature  
It is more accurate in cases where the radiant temperature is  
significantly different from air temperature to calculate the heat  
transfer to the internal surface of a wall using the *environmental* **8-28 Thermal environment**

# 8.13 Mechanical ventilation systems  
Mechanical ventilation may be required in buildings as an alternative  
or in addition to natural ventilation. Specific applications include\:  
• Deep plan spaces which cannot be ventilated from the side by  
natural means  
• Spaces with a high occupancy or high heat gain  
• Spaces with high source levels of pollution, including industrial  
processes and moisture in kitchens and bathrooms  
• Where the external air quality may be poor and so the external  
air needs to be filtered or taken in at high level  
• Where high ventilation rates are required in winter, mechanical  
ventilation \(with pre-heated air\) can be used without incurring  
cold draughts.  
# 8.14 Mechanical extract  
Local mechanical extract can be used to exhaust pollutants at source  
\(e.g. in kitchens, bathrooms and toilets; and locally for industrial  
processes such as solder baths and welding booths\). **8.15 Mechanical supply systems**  
Mechanical supply systems can be used in situations where a  
positive flow needs to be established between a space and its sur-  
roundings. Examples are\:  
• In a house or apartment to maintain a minimum ventilation rate  
and reduce condensation risk  
• Mechanical induction systems where high-velocity warm air is  
supplied to a space and extract is through natural leakage  
• Mechanical supply to an office and extract naturally, perhaps  
through an atrium or chimney/tower.  
# 8.16 Balanced supply and exhaust  
Mechanical ventilation systems in larger buildings usually have a  
balanced supply and extract, Figure 8.59. This allows\:  
• Control of higher ventilation rates  
• Heating and/or cooling of incoming air  
• Filtration of incoming air  
• Humidity control of air  
• Heat recovery from exhaust to supply air.  
# 8.17 Air supply rates  
If the air supply is for ventilation, then the volume flow rate can be esti-  
mated from the number of occupants in the space. This will be typically  
8 to 10 litres/second/person for normal environments, that is, average  
levels of pollution. If air is required as the sole source of heating then  
the volume flow rate can be estimated from the following formula\:  
Volume flow rate = design heat loss/\(\(*Tsu−T*ex\) × *Cp*\)  
where *Tsu* = supply air temperature  
*T*ex = extract air temperature, and  
*Cp* = volumetric specific heat of air  
In modern ‘low energy’ buildings, including dwellings, the rate  
of air supply for ventilation may be similar or greater than that  
required to meet the design heat loss. Therefore warm air systems  
incorporating heat recovery can prove an appropriate option for a  
combined heating and ventilation system.  
# Example 7  
*Calculate the volume flow rate of air to ventilate a 1000 m office*  
*space, height of 2.5 m \(volume 2500 m3\), occupied by 100 people*  
*\(each requiring 10 l/s/person\). If the design heat loss of the space*  
*is 15 kW, what is the volume flow rate required to \(assume at room*  
**8.59** *Components of one type of balanced supply and extract*  
*mechanical ventilation system*  
# Thermal environment 8-29  
*temperature\) heat the space if the supply air temperature is 30°C*  
*and the indoor temperature is 21°C?*  
Ventilation volume flow rate = \(100 × 10\)/1000  
= 1.0 m3/s  
= 1.0 × 3600/2500  
= 1.44ac/h  
Heating volume flow rate = 15000/\(\(30−21\) × 1200\)  
= 1.4 m2/s  
= 1.4 × 3600/2500  
= 2.1ac/h  
Therefore, in meeting the heating needs \(2.1ac/h\), the ventila-  
tion requirements \(1.44ac/h\) will also be satisfied.  
We can apply a similar strategy for cooling, if we can reduce  
the cooling load to a level that we can supply sufficient cool air  
within the ventilation supply air rate. For higher heat gain spaces,  
we can provide additional cooling through chilled ceilings. The aim  
is to decouple most of the cooling load from the air supply, thereby  
increasing overall efficiency and improving comfort.  
# 8.18 Air distribution  
For a mechanical ventilation system, air is distributed from an air han-  
dling unit \(AHU\) to the space through a system of ducts, Figure 8.60.  
The cross-section area \(csa\) of the AHU and ducts depends on the  
air speed for a given volume flow rate, and can be calculated from\:  
*csa =* volume flow rate/air speed  
where *csa* is the cross-sectional area in m2  
.  
The velocity through the AHU would typically be 2 m/s. The  
velocity through the main riser ducts may vary from 3 m/s \(low  
velocity\) to 7 m/s \(medium velocity\).  
# 8.19 Fan power  
The fan power required to supply air through a ducted system  
depends on the volume flow rate and the pressure drop in the sys-  
tem, which are related to the air speed. For an energy-efficient  
mechanical ventilation system with low duct velocity and short  
duct lengths between the AHU and space, the *specific fan power*  
would be less than 2 and as low as 1.2 kW/m3 of air supply, in total  
for supply and exhaust fans.

# 8.20 Heat-recovery systems  
An advantage of mechanical ventilation is that it can use heat  
recovery. This can be applied at all scales of building from  
domestic to large-scale commercial. It is especially appropriate  
for achieving energy efficiency in full fresh air systems. Heat  
recovery is only worthwhile if the recovered heat is useful and  
is greater than the energy used due to the increase in fan power  
from the increased pressure drop of the heat-recovery equipment.  
Table XXXVII lists the efficiency ranges of heat-recovery sys-  
tems. Heat-recovery systems should have a by-pass option to  
reduce fan power when heat recovery is not needed \(for example,  
in summer\).  
# 8.21 Air cooling systems  
Some buildings require cooling in addition to what can be achieved  
from ventilation alone. Such buildings may have a high internal  
heat gain, where mechanical ventilation will not provide sufficient  
cooling, especially during warm weather. The building itself may  
be located in a hot climate, where air-conditioning with cooling and  
humidity control is necessary. Cooling of air is achieved by passing  
the air over cooling coils in the AHU.  
# 8.22 Heat gains  
The main reason for mechanical cooling is in response to heat  
gains from people, office machinery, lighting, solar gains and  
high external air temperatures. Solar gains have been discussed  
in Section 4.2. Internal gains from lighting and machines can be  
high \(Table XXXVIII\), but they are often overestimated, which can  
result in over-capacity of the system design. Wherever possible,  
internal heat gains should be minimised by specifying low energy  
lighting and other electrical equipment.  
# 8.23 Room air delivery  
Chilled air can be delivered to the space, either in a mixing mode  
or a displacement mode.  
# 8.24 Mixing mode of air delivery  
The air supplied to the space is typically about 14°C at the design  
cooling load. The air is jetted into the space such that it mixes with  
air already in the space by entrainment and when the air enters the  
occupied zone it is at the appropriate temperature, speed and RH  
for comfort, Figure 8.61. Air may be supplied from the perimeter,  
the ceiling or even the floor.

**8.61** *Mixing mode of air delivery*  
# 8.25 Coanda effect  
Ceiling systems often rely on the *coanda effect*, Figure 8.62a, to  
ensure that the cool supply air remains at high level \(‘sticks’ to the  
ceiling\) until it is mixed. The coanda effect does not work at low  
jet velocities and the jet becomes ‘unstuck’ and can cause cold air  
‘dumping’, Figure 8.62b.  
# 8.26 Displacement air delivery  
Air is supplied to the space at a low velocity such that it displaces  
the air already in the space towards the ceiling extract, Figure 8.63.  
Air is usually supplied at the floor or through low-level diffusers.  
However, some floor systems that use *swirl* diffusers are assumed  
to be displacement but are really mixing systems.  
# 8.27 Air supply  
The temperature and volume flow rate of the supply air will often  
determine the type of system used. Displacement systems should  
have air delivery temperatures greater than 18°C or they are  
likely to cause cool draughts. So if a low-temperature air supply  
is needed to deal with a high heat load, then mixing systems  
are usually more suitable. Figure 8.64 shows the relationship  
between air supply temperature, volume flow and internal heat  
gains. **8.63** *Air displacement system*  
**8.64** *Relation between volume flow, supply air temperature and*  
*cooling load*  
**8.65** *Layout of a central air-conditioning system*  
# Thermal environment 8-31  
# 8.28 Central air-conditioning systems  
Figure 8.65 illustrates a typical central air-conditioning system  
layout. Such systems may supply air with a variable air volume  
\(VAV\) or a constant air volume \(CAV\).  
# 8.29 Variable Air Volume \(VAV\)  
In this system, the volume of air is controlled in response to the  
cooling load. As the cooling load is reduced, the volume of air is  
also reduced until a minimum air supply is reached, after which  
the supply air temperature is increased. Reducing the air volume  
supply rate reduces fan power and is potentially an energy-efficient  
solution.  
# 8.30 Constant Air Volume \(CAV\)  
With this, the air is supplied at a constant volume and the tem-  
perature of the air is varied in response to the space cooling or  
heating load. If heating and cooling is largely decoupled from the  
air supply and air supply rates are just to meet ventilation require-  
ments, then a CAV system can provide an energy-efficient solution **8-32 Thermal environment**  
in modern buildings, for example, coupled with chilled surface  
cooling in offices.  
# 8.31 Localised systems  
These are usually either fan coil units or heat pump units. They can  
be located around the perimeter of a space or in the ceiling void,  
Figure 8.66. A space may have multiple units \(typical for an office\),  
or a single unit \(typical for a hotel bedroom\). Fan coil units usually  
take air from the space and heat or cool it as demanded. Ventilation  
air can either be supplied directly to the unit from outside or be  
**8.66** *Ceiling fan coil system*  
ducted separately from a central unit, which only supplies venti-  
lation air requirements and not heating and cooling requirements.  
Fan coil units are served by hot and cold water systems that supply  
the main heating and cooling load.  
# 8.32 Chilled surface cooling systems  
Passive cooling is achieved by means of introducing chilled  
surfaces in a room, which could be naturally chilled, for exam-  
ple using night ventilation, or actively chilled, by water or air,  
Figure 8.67. Chilled surfaces absorb heat from the air in the space  
by convection/conduction, together with radiative heat exchange  
from warmer surfaces, including people. Chilled surface cooling  
devices can be in the form of fins, panels or beams. Sometimes the  
whole surface is cooled or heated, for example, by passing water  
or air through the concrete floor slab and exposing the slab soffit  
to the room. In cooling mode, surface temperatures vary from typ-  
ically 17°C for panels or beams to 20°C for chilled ceilings, with  
respective cooling loads of typically 70\(+\) W/m2 down to 35 W/  
m2. To avoid the risk of condensate forming on the chilled sur-  
faces in situations of high RH, sensors can be incorporated into the  
design to raise the surface temperatures. Alternatively, if mechan-  
ical ventilation is used the ventilation air can be dehumidified at  
the AHU. Air leakage through the façade should be minimised to  
avoid uncontrolled moist air entering the space. Chilled surface  
cooling systems can be combined with displacement ventilation,  
Figure 8.68, or CAV systems.  
# 8.33 Refrigeration  
Cooling systems require some form of refrigeration equipment to  
extract heat from the cooling fluid that flows in the cooling coils  
in the AHU, or in a chilled surface cooling system. A compres-  
sion heat pump circuit is shown in Figure 8.69. This can be used  
to cool or reversed to provide heating. An absorption heat pump  
circuit used for cooling is shown in Figure 8.70. The Coefficient of

*liquid state as it enters the evaporator where it absorbs heat and*  
*changes state to gas. It is compressed to a hot gas and enters the*

*reverse operation, it can be used to cool*  
**8.70** *Schematic diagram of an absorption cooling system.*  
*Refrigerant vaporised in the generator passes to the condenser*  
*where it rejects heat and condenses. Its pressure \(and*  
*temperature\) is then reduced by a throttling device before it*  
*enters the evaporator; here it absorbs heat from the chilled water*  
*circuit and becomes a low-pressure vapour. It then returns to the*  
*absorber*  
Performance \(COP\) is a measure of the heating or cooling energy  
output, divided by the energy used to operate the heat pump. COPs  
of typically 3 to 6 can be achieved for compression heat pumps,  
while they are much lower, at around 1, for absorption heat pumps.  
The latter are powered by heat and are most suited where waste  
heat is available.  
# 8.34 Ground and air source heat pumps  
Ground and air source heat pumps can provide a low carbon solu-  
tion for heating and cooling. They are particularly suitable for  
providing heated or chilled water for surface heating and cool-  
ing systems. Ground source heat pumps have the advantage of  
extracting heat from the ground at a temperature of about 11°C,  
which enables them to retain a relatively high COP, whereas air  
# Thermal environment 8-33  
**8.71** *Ground source heat pump*  
source heat pumps work to an external temperature, which can  
be relatively low in winter and high in summer, reducing their  
operating COP. However, air source heat pumps that extract heat  
from a building’s exhaust air system can achieve higher COPs.  
Air source heat pumps are relatively easy and low cost to install.  
Ground source heat pumps may have a vertical or horizontal heat  
exchanger \(Figure 8.71\).  
# 8.35 Ground cooling  
Ground cooling can be used for an air-based ventilation cooling sys-  
tem by passing the supply air through pipes buried in the ground and  
using direct contact with the ground temperature to pre-cool the air  
supply. The ground temperature at depths of 2 m or more remains  
fairly constant throughout the year. The amount of cooling obtained  
depends on the volume supply rate and the exposed contact surface  
area of the pipes. Alternatively, air may be passed through a laby-  
rinth of tunnels, which have a high thermal mass, for example under  
the building, in order to pre-cool it. In any system, the heat absorbed  
by the mass must be extracted through night ventilation or natural  
seasonal effects. During the heating season, the supply air may also  
be pre-heated through the same system, when the external air tem-  
perature is lower than the ground or labyrinth surface temperature.  
# 8.36 Hybrid systems  
Hybrid or mixed-mode systems combine mechanical and natural  
ventilation in either a spatial or a seasonal mix. Seasonal hybrid  
buildings may be naturally ventilated in summer and mechanically  
ventilated in winter. Spatial hybrid buildings may have spaces that  
are both naturally ventilated \(say, at the perimeter\) and mechani-  
cally ventilated \(say, in the depth of space\).  
# 8.37 Space for services  
The space requirements for the location of mechanical services and  
their distribution systems can be considerable\: typically, 2–15 per  
cent of overall building area, depending on building type, and must  
be considered early in the design process \(Table XXXIX\).  
# 8.38 Passivhaus  
Towards the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, the concept of  
Passivhaus was developed in Germany, with its standards for total  
energy demand for space heating and cooling to be less than 15 **8-34 Thermal environment**  
**Table XXXIX** **Typical space requirements for different systems for an office**

Total 1.5 3.5 7.5  
kWh/m2/annum of floor area, and a total primary energy use for all  
appliances, domestic hot water and space heating and cooling of less  
than 120 kWh/m2/annum. To achieve this performance standard,  
heating is normally combined with ventilation using a mechani-  
cal ventilation heat-recovery system, where typically, heated fresh  
air is supplied to the main living spaces and air is extracted from  
kitchen and bathroom spaces. Passivhaus walls are super insulated  
with U-values of 0.10 to 0.15 W/\(m2.K\) and triple glazed, with  
U-values between 0.70 and 0.85 W/\(m2.K\). The Passivhaus method  
can typically cost up to 15 per cent more, although costs can poten-  
tially be reduced if a holistic approach is used.  
# 8.39 Low carbon design  
Low carbon design of buildings can be divided into four stages,  
Figure 8.72. These stages need to be closely linked through a holis-  
tic approach to ensure that cost savings in reducing heating and  
cooling equipment can contribute to increased costs, for example,  
for renewable energy systems. A lifetime costing or lifetime carbon  
approach can also encourage investment in aspects of low carbon  
design that will be realised in future reduced running costs and  
security of energy supply. The asset value of a low carbon building  
should also ensure that it does not depreciate and will be relatively  
easy to sell or let in the future.  
The stages outlined in Figure 8.72 are as follows\:  
1 *Reduce energy demand associated with activities*. This includes  
reducing the electricity load associated with lighting, small  
power and other electrical equipment. This will benefit in two  
ways. First, the electricity used will be directly reduced, and  
second, the heat associated with the use of electrical equipment  
will be reduced thereby reducing any potential cooling needs.  
Of course, the incidental heat gains associated with equipment  
will be reduced from the point of providing useful heat to the  
space, but in a low carbon building, this is not always useful and  
uncontrolled in relation to heating needs. The ventilation load  
should also be minimised by reducing any internal sources of  
air pollution and separately ventilating any specific sources of  
activity requiring additional ventilation.  
2 *Passive design*. To adopt a passive design approach to reduce  
the energy demand associated with heating, ventilation,  
air-conditioning and lighting. This maximises the use of the  
**8.72** *Schematic diagram of low carbon design using a holistic*  
*approach*  
climate \(Section 1.2\) through solar control, use of natural  
daylight, thermal mass effects and natural ventilation \(where  
appropriate\). The design should be sensitive to the orientation  
and form of the building, its construction and distribution of  
glazing with shading or glazing treatment, ventilation opening  
and devices and use of materials. The Passivhaus standard is  
a useful target, although this will require mechanical venti-  
lation with heat recovery and very high standards of thermal  
insulation and minimising thermal bridging and air leakage. In  
future, reducing the embodied energy associated with construc-  
tion materials and building services equipment will need to be  
considered, as the embodied energy becomes comparable to the  
operating energy over the building lifetime.  
3 *Efficient environmental services*. Once the energy demand has  
been reduced through 1 and 2, the provision of heating and  
cooling becomes simpler and more efficient. The current trend  
for low carbon \(mainly office-type\) buildings is to use surface  
heating and cooling, see Figure 8.68 earlier, often in combina-  
tion with mechanical ventilation systems, which can incorporate  
heat recovery and some degree of heating and cooling. It is  
advisable to decouple the ventilation from heating and cooling,  
such that any air supply system is primarily designed for venti-  
lation and the main component of heating or cooling delivered  
is through the surface system \(heated or cooled floor, ceiling,  
panels, etc.\). The control of environmental services should be  
simple and responsive to people’s needs. In general, over-com-  
plicated controls quickly go out of calibration, especially with  
change of use, and are often illegible to the people who operate  
the building.  
4 *Renewable energy systems*. The final stage in low carbon design  
is to provide the energy needed for heating, cooling, ventila-  
tion and lighting from low or zero carbon systems, such as solar  
photovoltaic, solar thermal, wind, biomass, hydro, heat pumps  
and CHP. Once the energy demand of the building is reduced,  
the amount of energy supply is also reduced, thereby making  
building or community integrated renewables more achievable.  
The thermal energy from heat pumps and solar systems is also  
more appropriate to the reduced temperature emitters associated  
with heating low carbon buildings. Higher water temperatures  
for cooling, as for chilled ceilings, can increase the operating  
COP of heat pumps by up to 20 per cent. Energy storage can  
also form part of the design, capturing energy when it is avail-  
able and storing it until a time when it is in demand. Thermal  
storage may use a storage medium such as water, phase change  
or the building fabric itself. Electrical storage may use batteries,  
which in sunny conditions can provide all the electrical needs  
for some building types, for example, housing.  
The aforementioned stages bring together many of the topics  
discussed in this chapter. In many ways, reducing energy loads  
and the passive design aspect \(1 and 2\) are well understood by  
designers. What is less understood is how to provide appropriate  
environmental services and renewable energy systems as part of an  
integrated approach to low carbon design.  
# 8.40 Near-zero and zero energy  
The EU directive \(The EU Energy Performance of Buildings  
Directive of 2018\), defines a near-zero energy building as ‘a build-  
ing that has a very high energy performance’, where the ‘nearly  
zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a  
very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, includ-  
ing energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby’.  
A zero energy building \(ZEB\) can be defined as a net zero  
emission building in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, where the  
carbon emissions generated from grid based fossil fuel energy use  
are balanced by the renewable energy generation on the building  
itself. They are grid connected, and the zero energy performance  
is based on the annual net zero input and output from the grid. **Thermal environment 8-35**  
A true zero carbon building will have no fossil fuel use associ-  
ated with it. This can be achieved by total autonomy whereby the  
building is off-grid; although the combination of renewable energy  
supply and energy storage to provide total autonomy will generally  
be too expensive and impractical in relation to the size of systems  
needed. However, as the grid itself becomes increasingly decar-  
bonised with a higher proportion of large-scale renewable energy  
generation connected to it from wind farms and large-scale solar,  
it is possible to buy green energy from the grid. When combined  
with building intergrated renewable energy generation and storage,  
it will provide zero carbon performance. The speed at which the  
electricity grid is being decarbonised is reflected in the recent rec-  
ommendation from the Climate Change Commission, that all new  
housing should be all-electric by 2025.  
# 8.41 Energy positive buildings  
An energy positive building is a building where the total energy  
generated over the year by building integrated renewables is greater  
than the energy needed to operate the building, including heating,  
ventilation, lighting and appliances. Energy positive buildings are  
generally based on a Passivhaus approach to reduce demand, with  
renewable energy generation and energy storage a major feature.  
Figure 8.73 illustrates the energy positive performance in relation  
to energy demand and renewable supply. An example of energy  
positive design is the SOLCER house designed and constructed by  
Cardiff University’s Welsh School of Architecture, Figure 8.74.

*\(plus-energy\) buildings*  
# 9 PREDICTION AND MEASUREMENT  
# 9.1 Technique  
There are a number of prediction and measurement techniques now  
available that the designer can use to help achieve a good ther-  
mal design. Prediction techniques can be used during the design to  
inform the design process. Measurement techniques can be applied  
after construction, during the ‘hand-over’ period, in order to check  
the thermal design performance. Some of the more common tech-  
niques are introduced in what follows.  
# 9.2 Building energy models  
Computational dynamic building energy models can be used to  
predict the time-varying thermal performance of a building. They  
are able to predict the dynamic performance of a building and  
can account for the thermal capacity of the structure as well as  
time-varying response to internal heat gains and solar radiation,  
**8.74** *View of the south-facing elevation of the SOLCER energy positive house with integrated solar PV roof array* **8-36 Thermal environment**  
Figure 8.75. They will predict on a regular time interval \(usually  
hourly\) the following parameters\:  
• Internal air temperature  
• Internal surface temperatures \(including those from chilled sur-  
face cooling systems\)  
• Temperatures and heat flows within constructions \(e.g. in rela-  
tion to thermal mass effects\)  
• Internal relative humidity  
• Energy used for space heating or cooling  
• Temperature profiles through the construction \(including glazed  
façades\).  
These values can be predicted for each space in the building over  
any time period \(e.g. day, week, year\). The models require the fol-  
lowing input data\:  
• Meteorological data\: temperature, solar, wind. This is available  
in standard *TRY* format for various sites  
• Construction data\: k-values, density, specific heat capacity and  
dimensions for materials used  
• Building geometry\: areas and locations of walls, floors, etc.  
• Occupancy patterns\: hours of use, energy use, activities  
• Heating, ventilating and cooling operation\: times of use, system  
and control details.  
# 9.3 Ventilation and airflow models  
*Network models*  
Network or *zonal* models can be used to calculate the flow of air  
between one or more zones in a building and between the spaces  
and outside. They are computer based and calculate the flows  
between pressure nodes both within and outside the building. Their  
main advantage is that they can be used to calculate inter-zone  
flows and therefore air change rates, ventilation heat transfer and  
the transfer of contaminants. They can be used to study new build-  
ing forms, can handle a wide range of opening and crack types, and  
can predict the interaction of buoyancy and wind-driven effects.  
*Computational Fluid Dynamics \(CFD\) models*  
CFD can be used to predict the internal airflow and heat distribu-  
tion, driven by the combination of the external forces of wind and  
stack and the internal forces from buoyancy \(warm or cold surfaces\)  
and momentum \(airjet\) sources, Figure 8.76. It can also be used to  
predict the ventilation rate and the dispersal of a pollutant through  
the space or smoke movement in the event of a fire. CFD can be  
used to predict the external wind flow around a building and the  
resulting pressure field from which the pressure coefficients \(Cp\)  
can be calculated. It is therefore an extremely versatile and useful  
technique in the field of ventilation and air quality prediction. It  
is, however, highly complex and requires a high level of skill and  
understanding of ventilation design, building physics and compu-  
tational numerical techniques in order to obtain credible solutions.  
However, models are becoming easier to use by the non-specialist,  
and the need to use such models in ventilation design will eventu-  
ally result in their widespread use.  
*Wind tunnel modelling*  
A physical model of a building and its surroundings can be con-  
structed and placed in a wind tunnel, Figure 8.77, where it is  
subjected to a controlled wind flow. Pressure sensor taps can be  
installed at various points on the building envelope, correspond-  
ing to ventilation openings. The pressure at each opening can be

measured. This can then be related to the free wind pressure, at a  
point of known height above the surface, in order to obtain the Cp  
value as described in Section 4.  
# 9.4 Thermographic surveys  
All objects emit heat energy \(i.e. infrared radiation\), the amount  
being dependent on the surface temperature and its emissivity.  
*Thermography* is the term used to describe the process of  
making this heat energy visible and capable of interpretation. An  
infrared camera can be used to scan the surfaces of a building and  
produce a ‘live’ heat energy picture that can be viewed. The picture  
appears in colour or greyscale. The differences in colour or tones  
of grey correspond to differences in surface temperature across the  
surface being viewed. Surface temperature differences of the order  
of 0.5°C can be identified. Areas of defective or missing insula-  
tion can be detected by identifying locally warm \(viewed from the  
outside\) or cool \(viewed from the inside\) surface areas. Generally,  
images taken from the inside compared to those taken from the  
outside, can exhibit greater temperature variations due to their rel-  
ative higher internal surface thermal resistance and therefore be  
of higher resolution. If there is air leakage into a building, it can  
produce a locally cooled area on the internal surface, which can  
be detected by the camera. If there is air leakage to the outside,  
this can produce a locally heated area. Figure 8.78 presents some  
examples of thermographic images.  
# 9.5 U-value measurement  
The U-value of a construction can be estimated from measure-  
ments of internal and external surface temperature and heat flux.  
These measurements need to be carried out over a period of time  
to minimise the effects of thermal capacity. For lightweight clad-  
ding constructions, an estimate of the U-value can be achieved  
in about 8 hours. In heavyweight masonry construction, a period  
of a week to ten days may be needed. Measurements should be  
carried out on a north-facing wall or roof to avoid interference  
from solar gains.  
# 9.6 Air leakage measurements  
These offer a means of assessing the airtightness of different build-  
ings by comparison with values. The air leakage of a building can  
be measured by pressurising or depressurising the building using  
a fan measuring the volume flow of air needed to maintain a fixed  
pressure difference between inside and outside.  
Air leakage rate standards are normally specified either for  
whole buildings \(in air changes per hour\) or in normalised form  
relating to envelope area \(m3s−1 per m2 of envelope area\). Table XL  
presents typical design air leakage values. **8-38 Thermal environment**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Using light  
Light is fundamental to architectural planning and the visual qual-  
ities of a space and environment. Optimising light can transform  
interior and external surfaces whilst enriching visual and spa-  
tial experiences. Lighting should always be considered from the  
outset of a project to maximise a site’s potential and the opportu-  
nities within the design. In doing so, it can inform the positioning  
of the building and may play a part in shaping the parameters of  
the building envelope and internal room heights. Other planning  
considerations include apertures, window sizes, window depths,  
atrium spaces, views, vistas, spatial arrangements, roof lights and  
facade treatments. The size and proportion of architectural features  
and how they are lit can all contribute to the overall design.  
Lighting design has emerged as a specialist field. For the pur-  
poses of this handbook, the key considerations are discussed. It  
should be noted that technologies are emerging and improving  
all the time and so the options and possibilities are continually  
increasing.  
# 1.2 Brief and criteria  
The starting point of a lighting scheme should be a comprehensive  
and rigorous assessment of the design brief and function of each  
space, coupled with an investigation and examination of the pro-  
ject site. Consideration of the external presentation of a building or  
space might be a factor where internal and external lighting may be  
related or interlinked.  
Whilst the lighting objectives for a project are being defined, the  
identification of target criteria and opportunities should be particu-  
larised. The technical criteria, for example, might include several  
design aspirations and requirements, coupled with a combination  
of energy, performance or visual targets. Targets such as meeting  
the statutory requirements of the building regulations, achieving  
BREEAM ambitions or compliance with specific regional codes  
will influence the design. Once these requirements are defined, the  
lighting scheme can be explored with options whilst the design  
develops.  
# 1.3 Natural and creative lighting  
Daylighting can be blended with creative ‘supportive lighting’  
from a wide range of available technologies. As well as artificial  
lighting, these might also involve reinforced daylight harvesting,  
borrowed light, projection lighting and reflected or channelled  
light.  
For natural light, climate-based modelling or physical models  
can be used to inform elements such as window sizes, building  
aspect and site positioning. Early assessments to explore the poten-  
tial of daylight and sunlight for a building will enable factors such as  
shadow analysis, solar gain, glare and visual comfort to inform the  
design. For many buildings, strategic lighting will add quality and  
value, whilst potentially reducing the buildings energy demands.  
By influencing lighting characteristics, such as direction, posi-  
tion, intensity and tone, the expression of architecture can be  
significantly enhanced through designed light. Examples of these  
variations can range from subtle and integral lighting in support  
of a functional space \(without being intentionally expressive\) to  
a more commanding lighting approach to create visual intensity,  
focus and delight for specific needs or applications. It is possible  
to combine some or all these qualities in differing proportions to  
create defined and engaging spaces.  
For artificial ‘support lighting’, there are an abundance of tech-  
nologies to work with. These include LED based lighting solutions  
of many forms and type, light pipes and solar devices that can  
direct lighting through reflective means deep into a building.  
Lighting equipment has developed significantly in recent years,  
the efficiency, output and miniaturisation of equipment with the  
emergence of reliable, solid-state LED lighting devices enables  
functional and creative lighting solutions to be integrated into  
architectural planning.  
# 2 LIGHTING FUNDAMENTALS  
# 2.1 Light, comfort, reflectivity and heat  
There are several elements to be determined when planning the  
extent of light. These include glazing, internal lighting, and the mate-  
rial forms and selections within an architectural design. Generous  
glazing may result in impressive natural light and achieve high  
daylight factors, but when uncontrolled it can be a detriment with  
adverse glare or visual discomfort occurring at certain times of day.  
In the UK, extensive glazing, especially where positioned in the  
south-east to south-west aspects, need to be carefully designed to  
optimise the natural light and preferably limit glare. Large areas  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-11  
**9-1** **9-2 Light**  
of glazing will also affect the energy performance of the build-  
ing. The material physical attributes \(U and G values\) will impact  
on the overall building performance. Glare and heat gain can be  
tempered by carefully detailing the use of shading devices such as  
brise-soleil, louvers, overhangs, shades, blinds, recesses and stra-  
tegic obstructions.  
Solar heat gain can be useful in the winter as it can reduce the need  
for heating, but conversely solar gain may cause overheating in the  
summer. An optimal balance with a holistic environmental strategy  
should therefore be sought. Calculating the heat gain and heat-losses  
of a building will enable the designer to define a strategic balance  
and take account of the locality and dynamics through climate-based  
modelling. The relationship between light, heat and visual comfort  
should always be explored in detail to achieve the optimal outcomes.  
Internal surfaces and the glazing will have an impact on the  
visual presentation of a space. The reflectivity, form and position  
of glass will determine the extent of perceived transparency and  
views into and out of a space. Certain forms of glass can reduce  
inward or outward reflections and can enable deeper visibility into  
or out of a space. The positioning of artificial light relative to glass  
or reflective surfaces will affect this. Glazing treatments such as  
non-reflective coatings or architectural window films can enhance  
transparency or intentionally reduce it to increase privacy. Retail  
shop windows, for example on an open high street, will find that  
daylight reflections can detract from the ability to see deep into  
a shop unit. Internalised shopping malls are more controlled and  
afford higher levels of visibility deep into the space.  
The interior material selections will influence the visual qualities  
of a space. All materials and surfaces have reflectance values. Dark  
materials such as black granite or specialist imported dark wood  
will absorb light, and the effect can create pleasing contrast and  
visual interest. However, large or extensive use of rich materials  
will limit the inter-reflective properties and so the artificial lighting  
will have to work harder to compensate. Dark floors, walls and  
ceilings will significantly mute the reflected light. Understanding  
and developing the interior design will enable the lighting design  
to account for the surface selections. A white box \(with a quality  
paint\) will be potentially highly reflective. When the inter-reflec-  
tive values are high, lower levels of light can be used which will  
reduce the energy requirements.  
# 2.2 Site planning and orientation  
The approach to site planning when considering natural light  
should take account of several factors\:  
• Building massing  
• Building form  
• Solar geometry  
• Access to daylight  
• Existing obstructions  
• Overshadowing  
• Adjacent sites in near proximity with future development  
potential.  
It can be prudent to investigate the site history, identify acquired  
rights to light that affect nearby sites or rights that are of benefit the  
project footprint. These core factors, coupled with understanding  
any landscape features, will assist with the early stage strategies.  
Trees, shrubs and boundary features may have an impact on the  
amount of received light a site will enjoy, and these elements can  
vary over time and add dynamic qualities across seasonal change.  
Early decisions on siting and orientation are likely to be more  
fundamental than later decisions on fenestration.  
Broadly, high-rise buildings should ideally be sited to the north  
of a development when coupled with low-rise or low-density build-  
ings to the south of a new development. Assessments can be made  
to mitigate the risk of overshadowing existing or new buildings.  
Where advantageous to the project, south-facing slopes should be  
utilised. Strategic tree planting can afford natural shading for pri-  
mary pedestrian routes if arranged in optimal positions and with  
spacing based on anticipated tree canopies. Terraced housing/  
apartment blocks could be arranged to run east-to-west, so that one  
wall can face south. Detached or semi-detached dwellings could be  
planned to be on north-south link roads.  
Where these general approaches are not practical, the internal  
spaces should be studied to optimise the quality of light in the pri-  
mary occupied spaces. Courtyards should ideally be open to the  
southern half of the sky. Garages and parking spaces should prefer-  
ably face north. The pitch of north- facing roofs should be shallow  
to minimise overshadowing.  
# 2.3 Façade consideration and fenestration  
Façade treatment and window design traditionally features in the  
early stages of architectural design. Lighting modelling will enable  
the performance to be optimised. The detailed design of the façade  
and glazing, such as the profiles, glass specification, recess depths,  
protrusions and material choices, will all affect the quality of light.  
Almost all glass products will modify the transmitted light tone/  
appearance into a building. Low cost glass options for example  
may render internal surfaces with a green tint or blue appearance  
and the internal appearance will be affected accordingly. Natural  
lighting has important implications for site layout and massing, and  
for energy conservation. Solar geometry is the key to harnessing  
sunlight. Daylight factors remain significant criteria, with average  
values now replacing traditional minimum requirements.  
# 2.4 Quantifying lighting  
The skylight illumination reaching any point depends largely on  
how much sky is visible from the point in question. The amount of  
light striking a window \(and hence entering a room\) on a densely  
overcast day is roughly proportional to the angle θ, Figure 9.1, that  
is, to the effective angle in degrees subtended in a vertical plane by  
the sky visible from the centre of the window.  
The BRE Report ‘Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight’  
\(Littlefair, Sept 2011\) expresses the daylight reaching a vertical wall  
or window, on a densely overcast day, in terms of the *vertical sky*  
*component* SCv. This is the direct *illuminance* \(lux\) on the vertical  
surface, expressed as a percentage of the simultaneous horizontal  
illuminance under an unobstructed overcast sky. An unobstructed  
vertical surface would have a vertical sky component of 39 per cent.  
An additional check on the penetration of skylight is provided  
by the *no-sky line*, Figure 9.2. This is the ‘line’ \(actually a surface  
in three-dimensional space\) which divides a room into two parts\:  
one part is exposed to a view of the sky; the other part receives no  
direct daylight at all. The latter zone is disadvantaged with regard  
to both view and natural lighting.  
The recommendations in the BRE Report are summarised  
below in Sections 2.5 to 2.10 and in Table I.

# 2.5 New developments – skylight potential  
Two alternative checks are recommended to ensure that surround-  
ing obstructions do not unduly detract from the natural lighting in  
a room. First, from a standard reference height 2 m above ground  
level, check whether any visible obstruction projects above the 25°  
horizontal roofline limit, Figure 9.3. Odd trees may be ignored. If  
the 25° line is substantially clear of obstruction, then a target *ver-*  
*tical sky component* of at least 27 per cent should be achieved. If  
this first check fails, the obstruction may still be narrow enough to  
allow adequate daylight around its sides. To check this, it is nec-  
essary to ensure that every point on the façade, along the standard  
2 m reference line, is within 4 m \(measured sideways\) of a point  
which does have a vertical sky component of 27 per cent or more.  
The BRE Report contains a *skylight indicator*, Figure 9.4, for esti-  
mating vertical sky components on an obstructed site.  
**9.3** *The 25º criterion*  
Lighting simulations can be modelled with software such as  
AGI32, Radiance, IES and Dialux to determine the geometries and  
resulting outcomes.  
# 2.6 New developments – sunlight potential  
As the UK daytime sky conditions are notably overcast, the  
resulting daylight is diffused, which is ideal for comfortable  
natural light within buildings. Natural daylight can be designed  
to provide a significant contribution to the needs of the building.  
In public buildings, natural light is important in large spaces  
**9.4** *Skylight indicator. Source\: With kind permission of BRE* **9-4 Light**  
such as concourse areas, malls, and common parts. In climates  
outside the UK where clear skies and intense sunlight feature  
more frequently, a cautious approach to sunlight will be needed  
with consideration for diffusing and more active shading tech-  
niques.  
Incident sunlight is expressed in terms of *probable sunlight*  
*hours*. These are the total number of hours per year when the sun  
would, under typical cloud conditions, shine directly onto a given  
point.  
In a new dwelling, and in any other new buildings in which  
sunlight would be desirable, two recommendations for incident  
sunlight should both be met\:  
• One principal window wall should face within 90° of due south,  
and  
• Along this window wall, every point on the standard 2 m refer-  
ence line should be within 4 m \(measured sideways\) of a point  
exposed to at least one quarter of the annual probable hours of  
sunlight on an open site. These hours of exposure should include  
at least 5 per cent of probable hours of sunlight in the six winter  
months between September 21 and March 21.  
The BRE Report contains *sunlight availability indicators*, Figure  
9.5, for three latitudes\: 51.5°N \(London\), 53.5°N \(Manchester\) and  
56°N \(Glasgow\). These can be used for estimating hours of *proba-*  
*ble sunlight* on an obstructed site.  
# 2.7 Existing buildings – skylight protection  
If any part of a new building or extension, seen from the lowest  
window of an existing building, projects above the 25° horizontal  
reference limit, Figure 9.3, then two further tests must be applied\:  
• The *vertical sky component* at the centre of each existing main  
window must be not less than 27 per cent, and not less than 0.8  
times its previous value, and  
• The area of the *working plane* within the *no-sky line*, 9.2, must  
not be less than 0.8 times its previous value.  
The BRE *skylight indicator*, Figure 9.4, is designed for checking  
vertical sky components.  
In some cases, legal rights to light may supplement the BRE  
recommendations. A right to light may be gained either by legal  
agreement or if a window has received the light without inter-  
ruption for 20 years or more. Infringement of a right to light is  
judged by comparing *sky factor* contours indoors before and after  
the infringement. During the assessments, specific surveys should  
be made to identify the windows that may be affected. Rooms or  
spaces which form the main part of the building would be of inter-  
est where principle rooms are affected.  
# 2.8 Existing buildings – sunlight protection  
If an existing living room has a main window facing within 90°  
of due south, one of two alternative conditions should be met\:  
either  
• No part of a new building, seen from the centre of the window  
and projected onto a vertical plane perpendicular to the window  
wall, is more than 25° above the horizon, or  
• The point at the centre of the window, on the indoor plane  
of the window wall, must be exposed to at least a quarter of  
annual *probable sunlight hours*, including at least 5 per cent  
of annual probable sunlight hours in the six winter months  
between September 21 and March 21, and not less than 0.8  
times its previous sunlight hours in either period. The BRE  
*sunlight availability indicators*, Figure 9.5, are used to check  
compliance.  
# 2.9 Adjoining development land  
For a building to be a ‘good neighbour’ in terms of daylight, it  
should be distanced where possible from the plot boundary to  
avoid unduly restricting well-daylit development on adjoining  
properties. In high-density situations where there is a limited  
availability of land, a more detailed appraisal of the occupied  
spaces should be made to determine if there is an issue. A neigh-  
bouring site is likely to have daylight protection if, along each  
**9.5** *Sunlight availability indicator for latitude 53.5º N. The annual total of unobstructed hours of probable sunlight would be 1392*  
*hours. Source\:* With kind permission of BRE **Light 9-5**  
common boundary line, one of the following alternative criteria  
is met\: either  
• No new building, seen from a point 2 m above ground level and  
projected onto a vertical plane perpendicular to the boundary, is  
more than 43° above the horizon, or  
• Every point 2 m above the boundary line should lie within 4 m  
\(measured along the boundary\) of a point which has a *vertical sky*  
*component* \(facing the new obstruction\) of 17 per cent or more.  
Note\: There is no protection for sunlight \(or a view\), as distinct  
from skylight, along boundaries.  
# 2.10 BRE site planning aids  
The Building Research Establishment have developed a number  
of indicators to assist designers in meeting the BRE site planning  
recommendations\:  
• Skylight indicator, Figure 9.4  
• Sunlight availability indicator, Figure 9.5  
• Sun-on-ground indicator, Figure 9.6  
• Sun path indicator, Figure 9.7.  
Table I summarises the BRE criteria, indicating which planning  
aid is applicable to each criterion.

**9.7** *Sun path indicator for latitude 53.5 N. Source\:* With kind permission of BRE **9-6 Light**  
# 2.11 Solar geometry  
The sun’s apparent position in the sky is specified in terms of two  
angular coordinates\:  
• the *altitude* γ in degrees above the horizon  
• the *azimuth α* in degrees clockwise in plan, measured from due  
north.  
These coordinates are given by the equations\:  
*γ* = arcsin \(*sin*φ *sinδ−cosφ cos* δ *cos* 15*t*\) \(1\)  
*α* = arccos \[\(*sin φ−sinδ sinγ*\)/\(*cos**φ** cosγ*\)\] \(2\)  
where *φ* = geographical latitude of site \(positive in the northern  
hemisphere\)  
*δ* = *solar declination*, Table II \(north is positive, south  
negative\)  
*t* = hours since midnight \(note that the term *15t* is in  
degrees, not in radians\)  
the *altitude* of the sun at noon is \(90°*−*\(*φ−δ*\)\).  
# 2.12 Sunlight – the use of models  
A simple, scaled, physical block model is adequate for initial studies  
of solar penetration and to develop strategies of solar protection. A  
physical model can be illuminated by a small light source located as  
far from the model as possible to ensure near-parallel ‘sunlight’. Better  
still, in conjunction with a matchbox sundial, one can use the real sun  
outdoors as a light source. The relative positions of source and model  
are so arranged that the direction of the incident light will replicate the  
direction of the sun’s rays at the time and season under investigation.  
For increased accuracy, site-specific climate-based computer  
modelling can be developed which will account for site location,  
geographical features and exact orientation. It is then possible to  
run the studies to simulate the lighting penetration throughout the  
course of a year and then modify the design to make adjustments.  
For physical modelling, one way of bringing the correct angles  
of sunlight to bear on the model is to mount it on a *heliodon*,  
Figure 9.8. A simple turntable carries a platform which is tilted  
so as to be parallel to the earth’s surface at the relevant latitude,  
ground at the north pole being taken as horizontal. The artificial sun  
is moved above or below this horizontal datum plane, depending on  
the season/*declination*; it may slide up and down a vertical scale,  
Figure 9.9, whose solstice-to-solstice height subtends 46.6° at the  
centre of the tilted heliodon platform. The centre of the vertical  
scale should be level with the platform. The earth’s daily rotation is  
simulated by spinning the tilted platform so that the movement of  
shadows throughout a chosen day can be observed.  
A matchbox sundial, Figure 9.10, is a quick way to make a hel-  
iodon. It comprises a vertical pin or stick \(the ‘gnomon’\) standing  
on a folded tray which fits inside a standard matchbox. A grid of  
lines on the tray traces the position of the shadow of the tip of  
the gnomon at different hours and seasons. The seven monthly  
shadow orbits correspond to the dates and *solar declinations* shown  
in Table II. The matchbox sundial illustrated is suitable only for  
**9.8** *The heliodon\: a\) in use; b\) explanatory diagram*  
**9.9** *Graduated season scale for heliodon. A lamp slides up and*

**9.10** *Matchbox sundial for latitude 53.5º N* latitude 53.5°N. To use it elsewhere, tilt it about an east-west axis  
through an angle equal to the difference in latitude, shadows being  
shorter as you approach the equator.  
Align the north point on the sundial with the north point of the  
model. Shine a distant lamp on the sundial, casting the shadow of  
the gnomon at the month and time of day under consideration. The  
pattern of sunlight and shadow should be correct on the model.  
Once the model is made and set up to analyse, your design  
studio lights should be switched off and a single light source is  
switched on and positioned as far from the model as possible. By  
moving the light source and watching the sundial angle for the time  
of year, you can simulate how the resulting shadows that would  
be cast during the course of a year. The simulation can be photo-  
graphed to show the differing resulting shadows. If you are making  
photographic records, always do so from due north in the north-  
ern hemisphere, otherwise a shadow of the photographer, camera  
and tripod will appear in the photograph. In each photograph, it is  
helpful to include a card or note to show the time and date under  
investigation.  
The simpler method that does not involve darkness is based on  
the fact that the sun never ‘sees’ a shadow. Solar shadows are cast  
only on surfaces hidden from direct sunlight. Place the matchbox  
sundial, correctly orientated, beside a model. Align your eye with  
the tip of the gnomon, and with the chosen time and date marks.  
Those parts of the model which you can see from that position will  
be sunlit at the chosen time. Those parts which are concealed will  
be in shadow. This method also works with a heliodon if you place  
your eye in the position of the ‘sun’.  
Model studies are useful for three types of sunlight investigation\:  
• Seeing how far direct sunlight can penetrate inside a modelled  
room, and how effectively it is controlled by sunbreaks  
• Seeing how adjacent buildings intercept each other’s sunlight  
• Judging the quality of sunlight illumination received indoors  
after reflection from the ground and from nearby sunlit build-  
ings; this is more applicable to dry tropical areas than to the UK.  
# 3 DAYLIGHT INDOORS  
# 3.1 Daylight factors  
Daylight design in the UK has traditionally been based on the con-  
vention of a Standard Overcast Sky for three reasons\:  
• Prudence\: if the natural lighting is sufficient on an overcast day it  
is likely to be more than adequate when the sun shines.  
• Convenience\: a densely overcast sky looks the same whichever  
direction \(in plan\) one faces – north, south, east or west. The  
effect of orientation vanishes from the calculation but not, one  
hopes, from the designer’s awareness!  
• Given the overall brightness profile of a Standard Overcast Sky,  
the *illuminance* at any given point indoors must be directly pro-  
portional to the simultaneous outdoor illuminance under the  
unobstructed overcast sky vault, whether the sky itself is bright  
or dull.  
The constant ratio of indoor to unobstructed outdoor illumi-  
nance is usually expressed as a percentage and is referred to as  
the *daylight factor*. Thus, the daylight factor at a given point may  
be defined as the *illuminance* \(lux\) at that point, expressed as a  
percentage of the simultaneous horizontal illuminance under an  
unobstructed overcast sky.  
Until recently, it was customary to specify natural lighting lev-  
els in terms of the minimum daylight factor in a given interior. This  
involved a complex calculation, at the end of which there was little  
assurance that people’s impression of daylit spaces would actually  
correlate with the minimum daylight factors. The current trend is  
to express the natural lighting of a room in terms of the average \(as  
# Light 9-7  
distinct from the minimum\) daylight factor. This requires only a  
back-of-the-envelope calculation \(see Section 3.3\), and yields, for  
each room, a single figure which characterises the daylight level.  
Limitations of the average daylight factor and the perception  
of space must not be overlooked. In a medium-sized room, we can  
usually form a unitary impression of the natural lighting\: we sum it  
up as ‘bright’, ‘adequate’, ‘dim’, etc., as the case may be. But in a  
deeper side-lit space our impression is more complex; one end of a  
room may look bright, the other end dim by comparison. To inter-  
pret an average daylight factor with discernment we need to know  
at what point the concept will break down.  
Broadly speaking, a side-lit room is too deep – or the natural  
lighting unbalanced – when either the *no-sky line*, Figure 9.2, cuts  
off a substantial area of the *working plane*, and/or  
when *l/w + l/h \> 2 / \(1−Rb*\)  
where *l* = depth of room from window to back wall  
*w* = width of room measured across the window wall  
*h* = height of window head above floor  
*Rb* = area-weighted average *reflectance* in back half of room  
Unless the average daylight factor has been ruled out by one of  
the above considerations, it may be quoted with confidence to char-  
acterise the daylit appearance of a room. Thus an average daylight  
factor greater than 5 per cent will generally give the impression of  
generous natural lighting \(except, of course, on a dull day or in the  
evening\); an average below 2 per cent would be judged gloomy,  
and electric lighting would be switched on as soon as an occupant  
entered the room.  
# 3.2 Physical models in daylight prediction  
Scale model rooms have been used historically for the prediction  
of daylight factors. The ability to create exacting models through  
3D printing enables buildings’ shapes and forms to be created more  
readily. The basic laws of illumination \(the additivity, inverse  
square and cosine laws acting together\) dictate that daylight factors  
in a perfectly scaled model must agree with those in the full-scale  
building. Unfortunately, immediate application of this principle is  
fraught with pitfalls for the unwary.  
Architectural models commissioned for other purposes are  
unlikely to be suitable. Joints and corners must be perfectly light-  
tight. Walls must be opaque – so simple geometric models made  
from balsa and white card are out. Surface colours, and especially  
*reflectances*, must be correctly simulated. Glass *transmittance*  
must also be correct or, failing that, must be offset by applying  
a correction factor to the end result. Outdoor obstructions must  
be properly scaled, at least regarding their angular subtense, and  
also finished appropriately. Finally, the measured daylight factor  
must be adjusted to take account of dirt on the glass and on room  
surfaces, and to allow for any curtains or glazing bars, and for  
absorption of light by furniture and other impediments.  
In principle, the daylight factor inside a model can be obtained  
by measuring the indoor illuminance at some chosen position with  
a light metre, and expressing it as a percentage of the illuminance  
on the roof of the model. This assumes that the roof of the model  
is exposed to the whole sky vault. It assumes too that the sky is  
densely overcast; this requirement follows from the definition of a  
*daylight factor*.  
The necessity of waiting for the right overcast conditions to  
occur in the architect’s studio to enable physical models to be  
assessed has led to the development of artificial skies. Artificial  
skies provide a Standard Overcast brightness profile at the flick of  
a switch. These too have their pitfalls. Mirror-box skies produce  
multiple reflections of the model above horizon level. Those are  
usually too small to accommodate a model inside will be unsuitable **9-8 Light**  
for testing roof lights. Sky domes will suffer from parallax and  
horizon errors unless the ‘sky’ is very large compared with the  
model under test.  
Since most of the potential errors would cause daylight meas-  
urements in models to be overestimated, one can anticipate that,  
unless exceptional precautions are taken, daylight factors measured  
in a model will exceed those in the real building. This need not dis-  
courage the use of models. However, one may wonder if a designer  
should be completely focused on daylight factors when he or she  
can judge and fine tune the daylit appearance of his or her model  
by eye.  
3D printed models for the purposes of lighting assessment are  
reasonably easy to produce. 3D models are helpful in the early  
stages of a project to assist with the general understanding of the  
site and the relationship with the neighbouring buildings. Models  
can be used to explore both the spatial opportunities and how the  
lighting can be developed. 3D models are particularly helpful  
where buildings feature complex geometrics and the qualities of  
light and space are influenced by the aspect and spatial programme.  
The best approach is to formulate in advance the questions or  
concerns – they may be qualitative rather than numerical – which  
the model study is designed to answer. Analysis of these key ques-  
tions may well reveal that specific daylight factors are unimportant,  
and that more may be learned by studying a model under real sky  
conditions, facing alternately towards and away from the sun, than  
by leaving the overcast sky convention to dictate a programme of  
more detailed measurements.  
# 3.3 Calculating the average daylight factor  
The average *daylight factor df* is given by the following equation\:  
*df =* \(*T* × *W* × θ × *M*\)/\[*A*\(*1−R*2\)\] per cent \(4\)  
where *T = transmittance* of glazing material \(clear single glazing  
= 0.82; clear double glazing = 0.70\)  
*W =* net area of glazing material  
*θ =* vertical angle of sky seen from centre of window,  
Figure 9.1  
*M =* maintenance factor, Table III  
*A =* total area of interior surfaces\: floor + ceiling + walls,  
including windows  
*R =* area-weighted average *reflectance* of interior surfaces.  
# 3.4 Computational models in daylight prediction  
Computational analysis for daylight and sunlight has evolved as a use-  
ful tool for modelling how natural light will influence a design. There  
are a number of predictive simulation applications that provide a plat-  
form for examining the effect of light. Climate-based and site-specific  
based models will provide results that can used as part of the energy  
modelling so that the ratio of glass to solid surface areas and the asso-  
ciated heat gains/losses can be considered. Software applications such  
as Radiance, IES, Dailux, AGI32 are examples of some of the pack-  
ages that can be used Most software platforms will enable a CAD file  
to be imported to set the basis for the model. Computational model-  
ling should not be done in isolation of a site visit. It is important to  
visit the site to verify assumptions and inform site-specific factors.  
Outputs can be influenced by buildings at some distance to the site  
that may cast long shadows. Another influence could be adjacent fea-  
tures such as trees, and gradients and reflective surfaces.  
During detailed analysis and design, the properties of the pro-  
posed glass should be researched. The exact choice of glass will  
have a profound influence on the quality of light received within  
the interior. Budget glassing with poor colour clarity/unconsidered  
transmission may increase or decrease the solar gain and reduce  
components of the visible spectrum entering the space, thus ren-  
dering the interior with filtered or spectrally imbalanced light. The  
internal colours and interior qualities will not correctly be expressed  
if the glassing is of poor quality. It is good practice to obtain samples  
of the glass proposed for any building and test the options before the  
building is developed and specified. By holding the glass up to a  
fully open window, it is possible to compare how the glass is per-  
forming in contrast with the natural daylight qualities, some glass  
will appear tinted or will render the incoming light with a tonal bias.  
Typically, an architectural model will be built for daylight  
assessments within a simulation tool or a CAD developed model  
imported into the modelling software. The surface values are  
then assigned with specific elements such as windows or internal  
obstructions added. The lighting model can then be simulated to  
provide predictions based on the time of year and resulting effect.  
Interior lighting can also be added so that both the natural lighting  
and interior lighting design can be explored. Adjustments can be  
then made to the design and the process repeated as the design is  
developed.  
# 3.5 Planning windows  
The primary functions for most windows is to enable a view whist  
illuminating the interior. In principle the analysis of a view presents  
no great problem. A straight line can be drawn from the eye of

0.20 an occupant \(at varying heights\) to an object of regard outside the  
building. If the straight line passes through a window opening, in  
both plan and section, then the object will normally be visible; if  
not it may be necessary to alter the shape, angle or position of the  
window.  
Consideration for the exact arrangement should be made. For  
example, on challenging facades where heat gain and glare are  
factors, a double skin façade might enable a sunny balcony to be  
installed whilst tempering the light and potential glare entering  
the living spaces, Figure 9.11. The image of the recessed win-  
dow, Figure 9.12, shows how a calculated approach and modified  
# Light 9-9  
geometries can inform the window arrangement to reduce glare,  
with a recessed window an overhang combined with a lateral light  
scoop.  
As occupants move around the interior, the end of the straight  
line moves with them; a good view from the back of a room will be  
harder to achieve \(especially if the windows are vertically narrow\)  
than a view from just within the window area. The choice of desir-  
able objects of regard is usually easier in reality than in theory, but  
it is a choice that needs to be made consciously and deliberately if  
the window is to be optimised. Testing and optimising the views  
and position of apertures should take consideration of the likely  
functions within the space with thought given for how the space  
and occupancy might evolve over time. The setting out of interior  
lighting should also be factored in, as internal reflections of interior  
lighting will detract from the ability to see through the glazing. For  
restaurants where seats are located near windows as a feature, the  
interior lighting needs to be considered carefully so that the views  
are not lost due to interior reflections. There are techniques that  
can be applied to help, such as tilting the glass to move reflections  
away from direct view or the application of anti-reflectance glass  
or films. Alternatively influencing the external brightness levels to  
draw the eye through the glass can help.  
Visibility of the skyline within the interior plays a key role in  
effectiveness of daylight. Ideally, the view of the skyline should  
not be interrupted by the window head. Should this be impractica-  
ble, some direct view of the sky remains desirable, if only to reveal  
the clarity or cloudiness of the local weather.  
But the need for a view interacts with other aspects of the envi-  
ronment. A direct view of the sky can be a source of discomfort  
\(‘glare’\), especially when the patch of sky is close to the direction  
of the sun. On the other hand, the daylight factor at the back of a  
room depends largely on the amount of sky directly visible, see  
Section 2.2. Thus, there is a potential conflict between the imper-  
atives of view, comfort and uniform daylighting. This conflict can  
be resolved only by prioritising. The relative importance of the  
three factors will largely determine the right shape and position for  
each window

# 4 WINDOW DESIGN  
# 4.1 Developing window design  
We return to equation \(4\) for the average daylight factor, in  
Section 3.3\. The expression offers a natural sequence for window  
design decisions.  
*Stage 1*  
The first item to be fixed in the equation is the angle θ defined by  
the position of exterior obstructions. This depends mainly on the  
spacing and massing of surrounding buildings. The block layout  
is effectively fixed quite early in the design process, well before  
fenestration has been thought about. Access, prospect, privacy, site  
utilisation and microclimate are some of the formative factors at  
this stage. Because these will act as constraints on the daylight fac-  
tor, the determination of the angle θ is identified as the first stage  
in window design. Some relevant criteria and design aids are listed  
in Table I.  
*Stage 2*  
A side-lit room may be too deep to be satisfactorily daylit. This out-  
come was discussed in Section 3.1. It occurs when the *no skyline*  
seriously encroaches on the *working plane*, or when equation \(3\)  
indicates that the natural lighting at the back of the room will look  
unacceptably dim.  
If the room is indeed too deep for stand-alone natural lighting,  
the average daylight factor will not be a useful design criterion.  
Instead the windows should be optimised mainly for view and for  
thermal performance and, if daylight-linked controls, as in Section  
6.2, are contemplated, for the dimming and extinction of the row of **9-10 Light**  
luminaires closest to the window wall. Unless the room meets the  
two tests in Stage 2, the designer should proceed straight to Stage  
4, omitting Stage 3 of this window design sequence.  
*Stage 3*  
The window area W is estimated by inverting equation \(4\)\:  
*W = df* × *A\(1 − R*2\)*/\(T* × θ × *M\)*  
At this point, there is the conflict between visual and thermal  
considerations. The average daylight factor *df* is proportional to  
the window area *W*, but so is the winter heat loss through the win-  
dows, and so \(other things being equal\) is the daily mean solar heat  
gain. Passive solar design, harnessing both daylight and solar gain,  
may optimise by reducing heat loss through the glazing. Other  
approaches to design must face and resolve a three-way conflict\:  
daylight versus heat loss and summer heat gain. It is important to  
resolve these pressures on the window area at this stage, before  
proceeding to Stage 4, which is concerned with optimising window  
shape and position for each window.  
*Stage 4*  
By this stage, either the window area is established, and the average  
daylight factor settled in Stage 3, or the room has been identified in  
Stage 2 as too deep for stand-alone natural lighting. In either case,  
the shape and position of the windows have yet to be finalised, but  
the completion of the design is obviously simplified by the prior  
decisions in Stages 2 and 3.  
The competing claims of view, visual comfort and daylight  
uniformity were reviewed in Section 2.4 above. They centred on  
the visibility of the skyline. The avoidance of glare required as  
little visible sky as possible. A good view implied a good sight of  
the skyline itself but no additional access to the sky. Uniform day  
lighting mandated as much sky as possible visible from the depths  
of the room. The conflict must be resolved, in Stage 4 as in Stage 3,  
by identifying and balancing the relevant priorities.  
Also in Stage 4, the possible advantages of multilateral fenes-  
tration may merit review. Windows in more than one wall may  
improve the natural lighting in two respects\: by increasing the area  
of sky seen from the poorly lit parts of the room, and by reducing  
the brightness contrast between the sky and the window walls. In  
a naturally ventilated building gazing from two aspects will also  
promote cross-ventilation, mitigating summertime overheating.  
# 4.2 Applicability  
The above, idealised sequence is remote from the reality of  
window design. The results of applying formula-based design, win-  
dow-by-window would be a chaotic elevation, maybe unbuildable. A  
formal design sequence should provide a safety net for architects in  
trouble. Using calculation and simulation you can retrace your steps  
and recognise false turns if need be. The key to good natural light-  
ing design is to identify significant crunch points\: What is the most  
important or the most demanding room on a given facade? Design its  
windows properly. Repeat variants of the solution up and down the  
elevation. Then the windows will do their job, both as external visual  
elements and as components of the interior environment.  
# 5 INTERIOR LIGHTING DESIGN  
# 5.1 Introduction  
Developing a detailed brief and understanding of a space is essen-  
tial. For the best results, it may be helpful if a specialist lighting  
designer is involved at the early stages. It is then possible to adapt  
structures and spaces to include lighting details as the interior  
scheme develops.  
Lighting possibilities can be explored to address the obvious  
requirements and to identify the less obvious opportunities in a  
project. Lighting consultation will open-up a broad range of con-  
siderations, taking into account the daylight qualities, the sun path  
throughout the year, and how creative added light will transform  
this. Observations about the scale, proportions, materials, use and  
the intended impression or atmosphere are the starting points.  
The art of lighting design is to work closely with the direc-  
tional behaviours of light – its distribution, tone, spectral scatter  
and resulting light characteristics. The careful positioning of a light  
source will play a critical part. For instance, a visually reinforced  
processional route, or ‘rhythm’, can be set up using linear lines, lit  
architectural features or fittings spaced in regular patterns.  
By interrupting these or by setting up opposing junctions/  
angles, the rhythm can be slowed or altered by this intentional  
change in the visual pattern. The lighting can be concealed to be  
discreet, or be highly visible and expressive, or be a balance of  
both. Illuminating a great architectural feature or interior element  
can be more powerful and sensational to the eye than some arbi-  
trary lighting statement or gesture.  
# 5.2 Tone and mood  
If the surfaces of an interior are lit carefully and in good balance,  
the design can bring serenity, delight and inspiration into any space.  
For example, the feeling of well-being and mood can be affected  
by brightness, tone and intensity. Specific colours and tones can  
create feelings of excitement or calm. The application of lighting  
techniques adapted from theatrical applications can be considered,  
where surface texture can be created through light, transforming  
surfaces and forms with a broad range of possibilities.  
Once the interior tones and colours for a space are being  
progressed in a design, it is possible to start to develop an under-  
standing of how a space will feel. If a scheme contains dominant  
colours, rich or absorbing surfaces, carefully selected lighting can  
transform them. Selecting an appropriate light source with the right  
tonal outputs, lighting angles and controls can express or enhance  
the selected tones, colour and surface modelling. All materials con-  
tain pigments or reflective qualities which will visually resonate if  
the right spectral quality and blend of light is selected to achieve  
this. It should be noted that the wrong type of light on a quality  
material can be a detriment.  
With simple or more complicated lighting controls, it is possible  
to bring an impressive range of appearances or presentations of a  
space \(for example, creating five different spaces from one space at  
the touch of a button\). Carefully integrated lighting choices provide  
scope to transform a huge space to look intimate at times or trans-  
form a tiny space to look huge. Light, space and human perception  
can all be adjusted through considered lighting design, accounting  
for the aspect, views, vistas and interior architecture.  
The material tones or colours of adjacent sites and facades can affect  
the tones of natural light being reflected or transmitted into buildings  
and neighbouring spaces. The interior lighting needs to account for  
this, more so in schemes where spaces are densely clustered.  
# 5.3 Comfort  
Creating spaces that are comfortable to the eye is also vital. Comfortable  
spaces are where the eye is not forced to work too hard. If the eye has  
to struggle to reconcile a wide range of brightness and contrast values,  
it will become tired very quickly. The balance of sequential experi-  
ences coupled with a consideration of the range/field of vision should  
be used to set the parameters of light. Ideally, visual brightness differ-  
entials of circa 30 per cent between surfaces and spaces will keep the  
muscles in the eye working at comfortable levels. Stark shifts between  
contrast and brightness will always add drama and excitement, but  
care and attention should be given to the extent and positioning to  
enhance the perception of the space and experience.  
As low light or excessive light makes the eye work hard, it is  
good practice to track the external light levels to create exception-  
ally comfortable environments within the building throughout the  
working day at all times. This approach can be informed by light sensors externally and internally, where daylight within a building  
will bring savings and will alter the sensation of light in a space.  
Impressive energy savings can be achieved through the balancing  
of the intensity of light during the day and into the evening. Almost  
all commercial buildings in the UK will be occupied in the darker  
months of October to March, so if the lighting is programmed to  
account for that, brighter interior levels will create a greater sense  
of well-being in the winter months.  
Less can be more. It is important to consider primary surfaces,  
areas of intensity and the priority spaces, but secondary light or  
reflected light from a lit object or surface is often significant as a  
contribution. By electing what the primary lighting intent is for key  
surfaces and spaces, a selective approach can be taken to ensure  
that the elements of highlighting or drama occur at the right place.  
A totally uniform approach to lighting can be wasteful of energy,  
and potentially creates a bland appearance. It is better therefore to  
select and develop a lighting scheme that can enjoy a range of lev-  
els, but within the boundaries of comfortable brightness.  
Walking into a great space should be as engaging to the eye as  
enjoying a great artwork.  
# 5.4 Light source efficacy  
Energy efficiency for lighting should be carefully examined. Care  
and attention need to be given to the lighting source selection to  
ensure the attributes fit the needs of the project.  
The *efficacy* of an electric light source is defined as its *lumi-*  
*nous flux* \(*lumens*\) divided by the electric power consumed \(watts\).  
Efficacy is expressed in lumens per watt \(lm/W\). Lamp/LED man-  
ufacturers specify the lumen output of a lamp/LED.  
Note that lamp/LED manufacturers normally express lamp/  
LED efficacy as lumens per lamp/LED watt, whereas Part L of the  
Building Regulations specifies lumens per circuit watt including  
power consumed by control gear. Some representative *circuit effi-*  
*cacies* are listed in Table IV.

# Light 9-11  
# 5.5 Luminaires  
The word *luminaire* covers a lighting fitting complete with control  
gear, optics such as reflector, diffuser, lens and suspension where  
applicable. The *light output ratio* \(LOR\) of a luminaire is the pro-  
portion of *luminous flux \(lumens\)* from the lamps which emerges  
from the luminaire. The LOR for a bare lamp would be 1.00. Other  
things being equal, a luminaire having a high LOR is more efficient  
than one with a lower LOR. Typical values are listed in Table V.  
# Table V Light output ratios for typical luminaires  
# Luminaire Light output ratio \(LOR\)  
Bare light source 1.0  
Open reflector 0.8  
Pendent or surface-mounted diffuser 0.65  
Louvered luminaire 0.6  
Recessed diffuser 0.5  
The *luminaire efficacy* is the *luminous flux* output from the lumi-  
naire, divided by the electric power consumed, including losses in  
control gear. Luminaire efficacy, like *lamp efficacy*, is measured in  
lumens per watt \(lm/W\).  
Luminaire efficacy = lamp efficacy × LOR  
The *flux fraction ratio* \(FFR\) of a luminaire is the ratio of the  
flux \(*lumens*\) emerging in directions above the level of the lumi-  
naire, to the flux directed below the level of the luminaire. For a  
downlight, the FFR is zero, for an uplighter, infinity.  
With an FFR greater than 0.8, the ceiling may be more brightly lit  
than the working plane. With an FFR less than 0.1, the ceiling may  
look dark; so low-FFR luminaires work best when the ceiling, floor  
and table top all have a reasonably high *reflectance*. The FFR has a  
significant effect on the character of the lit environment. See Table VI.  
# Table VI Effects of luminaire light distribution on the atmosphere in a room  
# Spread of downward light  
# Flux fraction ratio  
# FFR Tight Medium Widespread

task in hand look oppressive  
0.1 to 0 8 Well-mannered, Safe, characterless? Welcoming,  
formal  
Over 0.8 Dignified Safe, relaxing expansive, relaxing.  
# 5.6 Building regulations – dwellings  
In new dwellings and in existing dwellings where major refurbish-  
ment is undertaken, at least 75 per cent of luminaires in regularly used  
rooms \(i.e. other than cupboards, wardrobes and storage spaces\) must  
use lamps with a *circuit efficacy* greater than 45 lumens per watt, and  
emitting over 400 lumens. Filament lamps fall well short of the circuit  
efficacy requirement and are being progressively phased out.  
Any fixed lighting must satisfy one or other of the following  
sets of requirements\:  
**Either** *lamp wattage* must not exceed 100 lamp-watts per  
fitting, and must be automatically extinguished if the area  
becomes unoccupied, or when daylight is adequate  
**Or alternatively**, *lamp efficacy* must be greater than 45 lumens  
per circuit watt, luminaires must be controllable manually, and  
automatically extinguished when daylight is adequate.  
The UK building regulations are due to be updated in late  
2021–2022 and it is anticipated that the criteria for minimum  
performance will be more ambitious. **9-12 Light**  
# 5.7 Building regulations\: non-domestic buildings  
The following requirements apply to general lighting in offices,  
industrial or storage spaces, classrooms, seminar rooms and con-  
ference rooms. They apply to new buildings and to buildings where  
substantial refurbishment is undertaken.  
The average initial *luminaire efficacy* must be not less than 60  
luminaire lumens per circuit watt. The circuit wattage for each  
luminaire may be multiplied by the control factors in Table VII.  
To derive the average luminaire efficacy, divide the total luminaire  
output \(lumens\) by the total circuit wattage adjusted by control fac-  
tors.

Electric lighting energy consumption must be metred separately  
from other electrical supplies, either by kWh metres in dedicated  
lighting circuits or in the lighting controls of a lighting or building  
management system, or by automatically logging energy consumed  
by the lighting.  
Lighting controls should be tailored to the nature and use of  
each space.  
# 6 LIGHTING CONTROLS  
Five types of electric lighting controls may be distinguished as fol-  
lows.  
# 6.1 Constant illuminance control  
Dimmable LED’s or high-frequency fluorescent *luminaires* can be  
linked to indoor photocells set to sustain a fixed target *illuminance*.  
Lighting schemes should factor in lumen degradation \(which  
occurs over time due and will reduce output\). Typically, 30% loss  
of output is not uncommon. It is possible to set the target light level  
criteria and then use a combination of light sensors and controls to  
balance the light levels.  
In practice, the lighting scheme would be designed to overa-  
chieve the target performance. The lighting control system would  
be set up to under-run the fixtures to attain the designed levels.  
Over time as the lighting output starts to depreciate naturally, the  
photocells will compensate for this by increasing the voltage and  
current to the fixtures to sustain a consistent output.  
This approach has an additional advantage in that when the  
room changes from one use to another, the setting can be adjusted  
to maintain the reduced lighting level.  
There are a range of lighting control systems and protocols to  
achieve this intent, and care and attention is needed to ensure the  
level of control is right for the project. Some controls are able to  
provide exacting levels while others might have limitations with  
regard to dimming speed, feedback and monitoring.  
# 6.2 Daylight linking  
One or more rows of luminaires along a window wall may be linked  
to either interior or exterior photocells, which monitor day light  
levels and adjust the electric lighting accordingly, preferably by  
top-up \(dimming\) rather than by automatic daylight-linked on-off  
switching. The latter may be resented by occupants unless they  
understand and fully accept the purpose and value of the provision.  
Note that high-intensity discharge lamps, and some compact fluo-  
rescent lamps, are unsuitable for dimming. Control zones should  
be parallel to the main windows. Daylight linking can be combined  
with the occupancy detection system, Section 5.5.  
# 6.3 Manual switching  
Manual switches should be close to the luminaires they control.  
A row of unlabelled switches invites indiscriminate switching.  
A lighting control system can be introduced to simplify lighting  
controls where standard switches or retractable switches can con-  
trol scenes or specific switching arrangements. Options include  
low-voltage switching, pull-cords, remote ‘wireless’ switches,  
radio-based controls, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or infrared. A lighting con-  
trol system can be linked to an energy-management system and can  
provide data for optimisation and energy savings.  
Manual switching with absence detection is particularly suitable  
for a cellular office or consulting room, or for workstations which  
are occupied only intermittently. A lighting control system based on  
DALI or other protocols can offer flexibility for future adaptation.  
# 6.4 Timed switching and dimming  
Electric lighting can be switched off or dimmed automatically via  
a time clock/control panel at the same time each day \(or specific  
days\), perhaps to coincide with work breaks, for example, at mid-  
day. Controlled lighting can be staged in a sequence, for example  
switching or dimming half the lights off at first, with further var-  
iations later. A manual override then permits users to redeploy  
the lights they still need. This system shares the responsibility for  
energy saving with the occupants, whose understanding and coop-  
eration should be assured in advance.  
There are several alternative methods for implementing a syn-  
chronised or staggered switch-off\:  
• Digitally Addressable Lighting Interface \(DALI\)  
• IP Addressed fixtures  
• Bluetooth devices  
• Low-voltage wiring to a relay/dimming control module in each  
lighting circuit  
• A mains-borne signalling system.  
In each case, other manual overrides should be provided, for occu-  
pants to switch lighting straight back on if needed.  
Time switching or scene setting is particularly suitable for a  
hotel lounge, a restaurant, a shop, a corridor or an atrium.  
# 6.5 Occupancy-absence linked switching  
The aim of occupancy-linked lighting controls \(presence detectors/  
absence detectors\) is to operate the lighting when, but only when,  
somebody is there to make use of it or to extinguish the lights when  
not needed. Some units flash a warning signal just before lights  
are turned off, so that an undetected occupant can wave an arm  
and avoid being left in the dark. Occupancy-linked discharge lamps  
with long restrike times should be supplemented by separate back-  
ground lighting.  
Occupancy detectors are suited to daylit spaces, and can be  
combined with daylight sensors, Section 6.2. Presence detec-  
tors can double as part of a security system or part of a Building  
Management System \(BMS\) to control heating and cooling. At  
night or at weekends they can activate an alarm instead of working  
the lights. They can also assist security patrols at night.  
Occupancy detectors may be triggered by air movement, by a  
flapping curtain or by events in a corridor outside the monitored  
space. Ultrasonic detectors seem more prone than passive infrared  
detectors or microwave detectors to these extraneous stimuli. The  
sensitivity of some units can be adjusted to minimise such fail-  
ings, at the price of their effective surveillance area. But the best  
arrangement is always to include manual-on/automatic-off occu-  
pancy controls with a manual override. The best applications for Passive Infrared \(PIR\) detection is  
where occupancy is infrequent or unpredictable, e.g. private offices,  
conference rooms, lecture rooms, toilets, warehouse storage aisles,  
photocopy rooms and archive or bookcase lighting in libraries.  
# 7 SIZING AN OVERALL LIGHTING  
# INSTALLATION  
The sizing of overall lighting installations for working interiors and  
for floodlighting is often left to computer simulations. However,  
the choice of target lighting levels remains in the hands of the  
designer or client. The Building Regulations \(Part L\) do not man-  
date target lighting levels. Wise choices may offer opportunities for  
appreciable savings in energy and in costs. Table VIII lists some  
recommendations from the Lighting Code of the Society of Light  
and Lighting \(SLL\), and other references.  
In many cases, especially in residential or public areas, a critical  
visual task is hard to identify, and the *illuminance* should be cho-  
sen to provide the right atmosphere for meeting, socialising or for  
relaxing. Especially where this is the case, listed values of standard  
maintained illuminance should be treated as a point of departure,  
not as a target. If a designer seeks a subdued atmosphere, a lower  
value would be right; if a livelier ambience is envisaged, a higher  
illuminance would be justified.

# Light 9-13  
aiming more difficult, and spotlights might remain unadjusted if  
the displays are moved out of the lit positions. There are motorised  
lighting solutions that can assist with flexibility and aiming angles.  
Effective display lighting depends as much on darkness as on  
illumination. Objects will stand out only if they look significantly  
brighter than their surroundings. Brightness has two aspects\:  
• *Illuminance\:* to appear noticeably brighter the illuminance on  
a surface should be at least three times the background illumi-  
nance; to stand out strongly would require a ratio of 10\:1 or  
more.  
• *Reflectance\:* if an object has a lower reflectance than its back-  
ground it will respond much less to an increase in illuminance;  
spotlighting may well be inappropriate, or the profile of the beam  
may need careful trimming to the profile of the target.  
The overall pattern of light and shade deserves careful consid-  
eration. To pick out a single focus of attention is simple and always  
effective. To highlight two objects risks an impression of disunity.  
To spotlight more than three requires skill and invites confusion.  
Aim for a simple and clear hierarchy of illuminance.  
The lighting of paintings, notice-boards, white boards and areas  
in the near of display screens, etc. must address two constraints\:  
• The lighting must not produce shiny reflections, which reduce  
legibility  
• The lighting should provide reasonably even illumination over  
the target surface.  
In Figure 9.13, the closest distance from which an observer can  
comfortably regard the picture as a whole is equal to the length of  
the picture’s corner-to-corner diagonal. This fixes the distance D,  
which shows the best position for a luminaire. If it were mounted  
closer to the target surface, the foot of the target would look dimly  
lit compared with the top. If it were further back, a visitor would  
see shiny reflections.  
In conclusion, a golden rule for successful spotlighting is ‘light  
the objects, not the people’. The positioning of luminaires should  
# 8 DISPLAY LIGHTING  
The effectiveness of display lighting depends as much on the skill  
of the person responsible for aiming it as on the good intentions  
of the specifier. A key consideration is to identify who is likely to  
take responsibility for the lighting once installed. It may well be a  
caretaker, a shop assistant or a clerk of works, with no training in  
display lighting techniques. If so, any track or adjustable lighting  
is likely to become poorly positioned and wrongly aimed. Fixed  
lighting, perhaps above louvers, may well be preferable in cer-  
tain environments. The following guidance relate mainly to track/  
adjustable spot lighting, but the same principles apply to fixed  
lighting.  
In a space where visitors are free to move around, there is  
a skill in lighting vertical surfaces without shining light straight  
into somebody’s eyes. To achieve this, start from the principal  
entrance and consider the routes through the exhibits and dis-  
plays. Run lighting track in strategic arrangements to provide  
low glare and discreet lighting. Arrange spotlights to shine over  
the shoulders of visitors following the preferred route. At each  
point along the route, make sure that the next stopping point is  
attractively lit, to encourage circulation in optimal directions.  
Visitors moving the opposite way will potentially face darker  
surfaces – by walking the course, it is possible to fine tune the  
lighting arrangements to optimise the look, drama and comfort of  
the space for all visitors.  
Track lighting and adjustable spotlights should preferably be  
2.5 to 3 m high. Lower mounting may cause glare, invite tam-  
pering, discomfort from heat radiated from the fixtures, and the  
shadows of visitors thrown on exhibits. Higher mounting will make  
**9.13** *The geometry of picture lighting. M = height of top of tallest*  
*picture frame, H = eye level of short adult, say 1.5 m* **9-14 Light**  
be constrained as much by the need to avoid glare and distraction  
as by the need to reveal an illuminated object. In an environment  
where the architecture and interior qualities are to be celebrated, a  
lighting strategy should be developed to establish the balance of  
lighting to optimise the potential of an environment.  
# 9 PROJECTION SCREENS AND REFLECTIONS  
The front surface of a display, white board or projection screen vis-  
ibility can be impaired when shiny reflections approach or exceed  
the brightness of the luminous pixels. Side windows present a dou-  
ble problem. If for example a laptop user faces a window, they may  
be distracted because the outside scene is brighter than the screen.  
The face of the screen should ideally be at right angles to the face  
of the window. If there are windows on two adjacent walls, this  
remedy may fail, and partitions or blinds might be considered.  
To optimise any environment, lighting design should be  
explored fully. There are opportunities to add visual delight to  
a space through blending the natural attributes of daylight and  
sunlight with artificial lighting, efficiency and drama. Additional  
functionality can be brought to an environment through strategic  
lighting design.  
# 10 EMERGENCY LIGHTING AND ESCAPE  
# LIGHTING  
Emergency lighting and escape lighting should be considered in the  
early stages of the design to avoid it appearing as a bolted-on after-  
thought. There are a number of elements that need to be examined  
in detail which include type of building, fire strategy, emergency  
lighting rationale and overall holistic design intent.  
Many types of general lighting can be adapted to work in emer-  
gency functions. This is useful as it can contribute to the look and  
feel of an architecturally developed scheme.  
Emergency lighting will require some form of battery back-up  
to drive the fixtures in the event of a power outage. Consideration  
needs to be given to\:  
• Required duration of the lighting to be operative in an emer-  
gency situation  
• Required output  
• Required light distribution  
• Relevant lighting codes  
• The requirements of the fire strategy consultant.  
Generally, lighting of principle routes need to be clearly defined  
and a low base-line level of light should be provided in all large  
occupied areas. The exact criteria for the lighting will be deter-  
mined by the project type. Certain types of buildings such as  
cinemas, places of public entertainment and visitor attractions will  
have project specific considerations to account for.  
# 11 GLOSSARY  
# Altitude  
An angle in a vertical plane, measured upward in degrees from the  
horizontal. The solar altitude is the altitude of the sun above the  
horizon.

An angle in plan, also called the bearing. The solar azimuth is usu-  
ally measured from due north.  
# Circuit efficacy  
The *luminous flux \(lumens\)* emitted by a lamp or *luminaire*, divided  
by the *circuit wattage*. See also *lamp efficacy* and *luminaire effi-*  
*cacy*.  
# Circuit wattage  
The power consumed by the fixture and light source in an electric  
lighting system, considering their control gear, and with associated  
equipment for power factor correction.  
# Daylight factor  
Equal to the *illuminance* \(lux\) at a point indoors, expressed as a  
percentage of the simultaneous horizontal illuminance under an  
unobstructed overcast sky outside, see Section 3.1.  
# Direct-indirect lighting  
Provided by a luminaire designed to combine the lighting charac-  
teristics of an uplighter and a downlight. It provides upward and  
downward illumination, sometimes in variable proportions, but lit-  
tle or no light sideways.  
# Efficacy  
*Luminous flux* output \(lumens\), divided by the electric power con-  
sumed \(watts\). See also *lamp efficacy* and *luminaire efficacy*.  
# Flux  
See *luminous flux*.  
# Flux fraction ratio  
Equal to the upward *luminous flux* from a *luminaire*, divided by the  
downward flux.  
# Heliodon  
Figures 9.8, 9.9. A physical simulation of the changing geometrical  
relation between the earth and the sun. The heliodon incorporates  
seasonal and hourly changes. A model of a building is mounted on  
a rotating platform whose tilt from the vertical corresponds to the  
geographical latitude of the building’s location.  
# Illuminance \(E\)  
The degree of concentration of light, in *lumens* per square meter  
\(lux\), striking a surface. Illuminance is measured by a special light  
metre – an illumination photometer; photographic light meters are  
mostly unsuitable.  
# Lamp efficacy  
The *efficacy* of an electric light fixture, i.e. the *luminous flux*  
*\(lumens\)* emitted by an electric light source, divided by the wattage  
consumed, It is known as the lamp circuit efficacy if all the power  
consumed by the electric circuit is included.  
# Light Output Ratio \(LOR\)  
The *luminous flux \(lumens\)* emitted by a *luminaire*, expressed as a  
fraction of the flux emitted by the light source\(s\) inside the lumi-  
naire. The LOR is sometimes known as the ‘luminaire efficiency’.  
# Lumen  
See *luminous flux*.  
# Luminaire  
A lighting fitting complete with control gear and suspension where  
applicable. In North America but not usually in the UK the term  
includes the associated light source.  
# Luminaire efficacy  
The *efficacy* of a luminaire, i.e. the *luminous flux \(lumens\)* emit-  
ted by a *luminaire*, divided by the wattage consumed by the light  
source\(s\) in the luminaire. It is known as the luminaire circuit effi-  
cacy if power consumed by the electric circuit is included.  
# Luminous flux \(φ\)  
The rate in lumens at which light energy is emitted from a  
source or received by a surface. For a given illuminance *E* lux, the flux striking a surface will be proportional to the area  
*A* \(m2\)\:  
φ *= E × A* lumens \(5\)  
Hence 1 lux = 1 lumen per square metre.

# Maintenance Factor \(MF\)  
The ratio of the *illuminance \(lux\)* of a lighting system, or, in the  
case of natural lighting, the *daylight factor*, after a given interval,  
expressed as a fraction of the illuminance or daylight factor when  
the same installation was clean and newly commissioned. See  
Table III for maintenance factors for natural lighting.  
# No-sky line  
The dividing line, Figure 9.2, in a room between the area which is  
exposed to a direct view of the sky, and the area which receives no  
direct daylight at all.  
# Probable sunlight hours  
The long-term average number of hours per year when direct sun-  
light is visible from a given point. Long-term weather conditions  
are taken into account.  
# Reflectance \(R\)  
The proportion of incident light which a surface reflects. A pure  
white surface would have a reflectance of 1.00, a perfectly black  
surface would have zero reflectance. Most paints and surface mate-  
rials will have a reflectance value that can be obtained; these values  
have a profound influence on the resulting light. Table IX provides  
some approximate values for typical surfaces.  
**Table IX** **Reflectance of some familiar surfaces**  
# Surface Reflectance  
White emulsion paint on plaster 0.80  
Pink plaster 0.65

Black 00 E 53 0.05  
Note\: Some paints/surfaces have been developed to provide specific reflectance values.  
# Sky factor  
The horizontal *illuminance* \(lux\) at a given point due to light  
received directly through an unglazed window opening from a sky  
of uniform brightness, expressed as a percentage of the horizon-  
tal illuminance under an unobstructed vault of the same sky. See  
Section 2.5. Zero *reflectance* is ascribed to interior and exterior  
surfaces.  
# Skylight indicator  
Figure 9.4, for checking the daylight potential of new buildings  
and daylight protection for existing buildings. It provides an esti-  
mate of *the vertical sky component* on a built-up site. The centre  
of the semi-circular indicator corresponds to the position in plan  
of the reference point. Its base should run along the plane of the  
window wall. Radial distances correspond to the ratio \(distance of  
obstruction on plan\)/\(height of obstruction above *reference* point\).  
Each little cross stands for a vertical sky component of 0.5 per cent.  
# Light 9-15  
Count how many crosses fall within the outline of the sky. Divide  
by 2. The answer equals the vertical sky component, expressed as  
a percentage.  
# Solar declination  
At any one moment, the sun is precisely overhead at some point  
on the earth’s surface. The latitude of this point depends on the  
season, and is known as the solar declination. Some values of solar  
declination are shown in Table II.  
# Sunlight availability indicator  
Figure 9.5, for checking sunlight protection for existing buildings  
and sunlight potential for new buildings. It provides a measure of  
the *probable sunlight hours* on a built-up site. The centre of the  
indicator corresponds to the position in plan of the reference point.  
Radial distances correspond to the ratio \(distance of obstruction  
on plan\)/\(height of obstruction above reference point\). Align the  
south point of the indicator with the south point of the site plan.  
Each of the 100 dots on the indicator stands for 1 per cent of the  
annual probable hours of sunlight. Choose the indicator whose  
stated latitude \(51.5°, 53.5° or 56°\) is closest to the geographical  
latitude of the site. If a dot is closer to the centre than any obstruc-  
tion in that direction, then sunlight from that dot is unobstructed  
\(unless, of course, it comes from behind the facade\). Count the  
unobstructed dots. The total is the percentage of probable sunlight  
hours. Littlefair \(2011\) recommends an annual exposure to at least  
25 unobstructed dots, including at least five from beyond the equi-  
nox line.  
# Sun-on-ground indicator  
See Figure 9.6, designed for site planning, showing the length  
and direction of shadows at the equinox. The Building Research  
Establishment has issued indicators for the following latitudes  
– 51.5°, 53.5° and 56° – each at scales of 1\:100, 1\:200, 1\:500  
and 1\:1250. Place the point P of the indicator over a reference  
point at ground level on plan. Line the south point of the indi-  
cator with the south point on the plan. Parallel east – west lines  
on the indicator show the heights of obstructions which would  
just intercept direct sunlight at the time indicated. Hence, one  
can estimate the hours of potential sunlight reaching any point  
on the ground at the equinox. Sunlight less than 10° above the  
horizon is ignored.  
# Sun path indicator  
See Figure 9.7, for checking times and seasons when direct  
sunlight strikes a given reference point on a built-up site. It is  
aligned and scaled in the same way as the *sunlight availabil-*  
*ity indicator*. Choose the indicator whose stated latitude \(51.5°,  
53.5° or 56°\) is closest to the geographical latitude of the site.  
If a point on one of the sun path lines is closer to the centre  
than any obstruction in that direction, then the sunlight at that  
moment is unobstructed \(unless, of course, it comes from behind  
the facade\).  
# Transmittance \(T\)  
The proportion of *luminous flux* in lumens striking the upper sur-  
face of a transparent or translucent sheet which emerges from the  
lower surface. The transmittance of clear single layer of window  
glass for reference is taken as 0.82; double glazing 0.70.  
*Note\: These values refer to diffuse incidence. Figures from*  
*glass manufacturers usually refer to normal incidence, and are*  
*correspondingly higher*.  
# Vertical Sky Component \(SCv\)  
The *illuminance* in lux on a vertical element at a point due to direct  
light from the overcast sky vault, expressed as a percentage of the  
simultaneous horizontal illuminance under the whole unobstructed  
sky vault. **9-16 Light**  
# Working plane  
The flat plane on which the visual task is located. In a corridor, this  
would be at floor level. In a shop, at counter height. In an office –  
average desk height 0.7 m, a factory or kitchen 0.85 m above floor  
level. Unless otherwise stated the working plane is assumed to be  
horizontal.

# 2 FUNDAMENTALS OF ACOUSTICS  
# 2.1 Creating sound  
Consider a tuning fork \(Figure 10.1\). When the fork is struck,  
the prongs vibrate. As the prongs vibrate, the air particles around  
the prongs are pushed away. These air particles in turn push the  
air particles next to them and so on, thereby creating a pressure  
wave through the air. This forced wave motion is what our senses  
interpret as sound in the inner ear. In all instances, we will have a  
vibrating source \(e.g. the tuning fork\), a path \(the air\) and a receiver  
\(normally a person\).  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
There are three main areas for consideration when designing build-  
ings for good acoustics.  
1 The control of sound break-in from external noise sources; most  
commonly from transportation, industrial and/or commercial  
\(pubs, clubs, etc.\) activities  
2 The control of sound transmission through a building; most  
commonly from building users \(voices, TV, stereo, footfall,  
living activities\) but can also include control of sound from  
building services \(fixed plant, ventilation systems\)  
3 The acoustic quality of a room; most commonly the level of  
reverberation \(echo\) in a room effective for a given function  
\(speech clarity, music\).  
Consideration of acoustic design during the early stages of a  
project can substantially reduce the potential for costly remedial  
# 2.2 Sound transmission  
Forced particle motion forms wave patterns and so allows sound  
to travel within air. As the particles form waves, they propagate,  
diffract and curve like other wave forms, which is why sound can  
be heard round corners or through small gaps in a structure.  
We can reduce a sound by controlling the noise at source,  
altering the transmission path or by changing the acoustics of the  
listeners’ location.  
Controlling the noise at source is not always possible for most  
sources affecting a building, as they are outside the designer’s  
control \(motorway traffic, the activities of a neighbour etc.\). The  
exception to this would be noise from sources associated with the  
design of a new building \(ventilation plant, services\). Here, the  
selection of suitable equipment and plant will reduce the likelihood  
of noise complaint.  
The second option, altering the sound transmission path, is  
the most readily used method of reducing sound from a source.  
This can be seen in the use of heavy, double-glazed windows to  
lower road traffic noise, or the construction of a twin stud partition  
instead of a single stud partition to separate dwellings.  
**10.1** *How sound is created*  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-12 **10-1** **10-2 Sound**  
By changing the materials and properties of a façade, floor or  
wall we can alter the sound path and the way that sound is trans-  
mitted \(Figure 10.2\).  
The third option is to alter the acoustics of the space or room in  
which the receiver is situated. While this will have a limited effect  
on the annoyance of noise from external sources, it can improve  
the acoustic environment within a room. This is important when  
considering things such as speech intelligibility or suitable listen-  
ing environments.  
**10.2** *Source – path receiver*  
In most rooms, the RT will be a product of the room volume and  
material finishes. The larger a room volume, the longer it will take  
sound to reach and interact \(i.e. be reflected or absorbed\) with the  
material finishes.  
Other factors influencing RT include room shape and surface  
diffusion, both linked to the spread of sound within the space.  
A key means of controlling the RT within a space is to introduce  
acoustically absorbent finishes. Materials can be classified by their  
acoustic absorption in line with the guidance given in BS EN ISO  
11654\:1997; Acoustics – Sound absorbers for use in Buildings –  
Rating of Sound Absorption. This allows the designer to specify  
a classification of material rather than being forced into giving a  
prescriptive specification.  
Figure 10.3 details the absorption classifications that are nor-  
mally associated with absorbent materials specified in the UK.  
They run from Class A materials \(those with the highest levels of  
acoustic absorption\) to Class E materials \(those with the lowest  
levels of acoustic absorption\)  
Classification of a material against the absorption coefficient  
graph shown in Figure 10.3 may not be suitable for all material  
types e.g. panel absorbers tend to provide high performance only at  
a narrow frequency band.  
BS EN ISO 11654 also allows for the average absorption coef-  
ficient of a material to be used as a method of defining is absorption  
classification. This is detailed in Table I where άw is the average  
acoustic absorption of the material.  
# 2.3 Reverberation time  
Acoustic absorption occurs when sound comes into contact with  
an acoustically porous material. In a bedroom, the carpet, curtains,  
bed and bedding are all acoustically absorbent and so have the  
effect of reducing the reverberation time \(RT, echo\) within a space.  
This can make a sound quieter than in a ‘live’ room or a room with  
lots of hard reflective surfaces, such as a bathroom. Hard smooth  
surfaces within a room will increase the RT \(echo\) within a space.  
The size or volume of a space will also have an effect on the RT.  
We can measure this effect in a room by creating an impulsive  
sound \(a sudden bang or burst of noise\) and measuring the time it  
takes this noise level to fall by 60 decibels \(dB\).  
**Table I** **BS EN ISO 11654 Absorption classifications for average absorptions**  
# values  
**Sound absorption class άw \(average acoustic absorption\)**  
A 0.90, 0.95, 1.00  
B 0.80, 0.85  
C 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75  
D 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55  
E 0.25, 0.20, 0.15  
Not classified 0.10, 0.05, 0.00  
By detailing appropriate materials, we can achieve a required  
RT within a room. The RT of a room is normally used as the  
**10.3** *BS EN ISO 11654 absorption classifications* **Sound 10-3**  
performance criteria when designing rooms for good speech intel-  
ligibility or listening environments.  
A designer may use guidance in this book to select a RT design  
criterion relative to a rooms function. The RT of most rooms is nor-  
mally specified when furnished but unoccupied. It may be specified  
at a single frequency or as an average of many.  
When designing for good room acoustics in large or complex  
rooms such as performance spaces, it is advisable to seek profes-  
sional advice throughout the design to consider the criteria, room  
shape, and the location and type of absorption.  
# 3 REDUCING SOUND TRANSMISSION FROM  
# EXTERNAL SOURCES  
# 3.1 Guidance  
In the UK, the level of noise at which disturbance from particu-  
lar noise sources is likely to occur within a dwelling can be found  
in planning guidance such as\: ProPG – Planning and Noise and  
Technical Advice Note – Assessment of Noise. In addition to the  
planning guidelines, other guidance documents can be used to  
assess noise within non-domestic builds. In most instances, we are  
concerned with the level of noise break-in from external sources  
which are outside the control of the building owner or occupier.  
**LDEN.** This is a compounded noise level based on the Leq parameter  
but defined over all days, evenings and nights in a year, and con-  
tains a 10 dB\(A\) penalty for the night-time period \(23.00–07.00\)  
and a further 5 dB\(A\) penalty for evening noise \(19.00–23.00\). It  
is commonly used in environmental noise surveys to account for  
typical human sensitivity to noise, particularly for traffic noise  
sources and is a primary parameter for noise mapping.  
For most transportation sources, it is suggested that external aver-  
age noise level of below LAeq\(16hours\) 55 dB during the daytime and  
LAeq\(8hours\) 45 dB during the night-time are likely to be an indication  
of low risk of disturbance. For comparison, Table II lists likely noise  
levels for a variety of typical urban and suburban areas.  
# 3.3 Control of external noise levels  
The permissible level of noise outside a building can differ greatly  
dependant on the source of noise, nature of the development or  
even the policy of the local authority.  
The World Health Organization suggests external free-field  
levels of below LAeq \(16hours\) 50–55 dB as suitable to avoid serious  
disturbance or annoyance during the daytime. European guidance  
suggesting maximum external free-field levels outside a dwelling  
of LAeq \(8hours\) 40 dB as being suitable to avoid noise disturbance at  
night. In many instances \(city centre, some urban and suburban  
areas\), a different approach may be suitable.  
Table III defines some of the standard noise criteria. External  
noise is normally considered an issue for residential properties but  
can be a requirement for outdoor workspaces or education spaces.  
The requirements of different local authorities can vary greatly and  
so consultation with planning and environmental health depart-  
ments should always be sought when designing for the control of  
external noise levels. The criteria in Table III are based on relevant  
standards and experience of local authority expectations.  
# Table II Likely external ambient noise levels  
# 3.2 Defining levels  
Noise levels are usually not simply defined as decibels. A measure-  
ment parameter is also defined which details the type of noise level  
considered, often as an A-weighted decibel level, measured as an  
average, time fraction or maximum level, as outlined in the following.  
**LAeq**\: The average measured noise level over a defined period of  
time \(LAeq \(16hours\), LAeq \(8hours\), etc.\). The ‘A’ in the LAeq parameter  
means that the noise level has been weighted so that it is akin to  
the subjective noise level that the average person would hear.  
**LAmax**\: The highest single noise event for a given measurement  
duration, such as would be associated with a sudden increase in  
noise such as a train pass by.  
**LA90**\: This is the underlying noise level or the average noise level  
which is exceeded for 90 per cent of the measurement period.  
This is often referred to as the background noise level represent-  
ing quiet periods or lulls in the average noise level. Noise control  
to the background reduces risk of disturbance, that is, during the  
periods between vehicles passing a dwelling where industrial or  
commercial noise may be audible and cause disturbance.

Noise from entertainment sources \(bars, clubs, pubs\) are not normally  
required to be controlled outside the nearest residential property, as in  
most cases noise from these sources is associated with night-time use  
and sleep disturbance within a property. Control levels for such noise  
will differ from one Local Authority to another, and so they should  
always be consulted either when building dwellings next to an entertain-  
ment source or when introducing a new source of entertainment noise.  
‘Agent of Change’ principals, being incorporated into planning  
guidance, place the onus onto the developer to mitigate noise. This  
prevents new residential developments from burdening existing  
entertainment venues with mitigation obligations or threatening  
their operations. In some areas, these principals are being extended  
to other commercial operations.  
# 3.4 Distance attenuation  
The more distant a receiver is from a noise source, the quieter the  
level of noise. With environmental noise sources, the rate of atten-  
uation will depend upon whether the noise source propagates as a  
*point source*, or as a *line source*. If a house were located 20 m from  
a road, this would be considered a line source, and so the level of  
noise would reduce by 13 dB. If the house were 20 m from a point  
source \(an air conditioning unit\) the level would be reduced by  
26 dB relative to the measured noise level at the source.  
As a general rule of thumb, the difference between line source  
and point source attenuation is\:  
• 3 dB reduction in noise level for each doubling of distance from  
a line source  
• 6 dB reduction in noise level for each doubling of distance from  
a point source.  
# 3.5 Acoustic barriers  
Noise can be reduced by the construction of an acoustic barrier.  
An acoustic barrier can be as simple as a close-boarded fence,  
earth bund, or combination of both. By breaking the direct line of  
sight between a noise source and the receiver, we reduce the level  
of sound because we are increasing the distance the sound has to  
travel \(i.e. the sound has to go over the top of the barrier\).  
The level of attenuation for an acoustic barrier will be depend-  
ent on the following factors\:  
• The height and length of the barrier – the higher the barrier, the  
greater its expected performance, however the length should  
ensure that height is the critical factor.  
• The shape of the top of the barrier can increase the effective  
height/path difference.  
• The type of noise source – barriers are more effective for station-  
ary noise sources such as fixed plant than for a moving source  
such as vehicles.  
• The height of the noise source – the higher the source, the higher  
the barrier will have to be to break the line of sight.  
• The height of the receiver – the higher the receiver, the higher  
the barrier will have to be to break the line of sight.  
• The distance between the source and the barrier – it is always  
preferable to place the barrier as close to the source as possible.  
• Where the aforementioned cannot be achieved, the next best  
option is to position the barrier as close to the receiver as possible.  
• The worst position for a barrier is half way between the source  
and the receiver.  
• The mass of the barrier – generally the minimum surface mass of  
any acoustic barrier should not be less than 15 kg/m2.  
• Gaps, cracks, and damage are all critical factors to reduced perfor-  
mance and therefore good materials, design and durability are key.  
# Table IV Basic sound reduction levels from acoustic barriers  
Full barrier \(full break in line of sight from source to receiver\) −10 dB  
Partial barrier \(partial break in line of sight from source to receiver\) −5 dB  
The calculation of the attenuation offered by an acoustic barrier can  
be complicated, but a good rule of thumb is to assume a 5 dB reduc-  
tion for a partial barrier effect and 10 dB for a full barrier effect,  
see Table IV. For example, a 2 m barrier is likely to provide 10 dB  
reduction from road traffic at ground floor level and 5 dB reduction  
at first floor level.  
Higher levels of acoustic insulation can be provided by increas-  
ing barrier height, but this can become impractical and expensive.  
Barriers with a sound absorbing face to the source side may provide  
additional performance in some enclosed scenarios.  
The insulation performance of a barrier should be defined with  
the parameter *DL*R dB and may be categorised by performance  
from B0 to B4, as defined within BS EN 1793–2. Typically, B2 or  
B3 barriers shall provide performances of *DL*R 15 to \>24 dB how-  
ever it is useful to seek an end-of-life performance guarantee given  
that in-situ timber barrier performance has been found to drop by  
4–7 dB in the first 5 years of use due to poor design/damage.  
# 3.6 Angle of view  
The orientation of a building or a noise sensitive room away from a  
noise source can also reduce the level of noise disturbance experi-  
enced. If the room is at an angle to the source \(i.e. not at 90 degrees\)  
then there is typically a reduction in noise relative to the angle of view.  
Table V outlines the expected reductions in sound levels at 500 Hz  
and 1000 Hz dependant on the angle of view from source to receiver.  
# Table V Angle of view correction

**90o** **6** **6**  
**135o** **15** **17**  
**180o** **17** **19**  
# 3.7 Façade attenuation  
Building façade specification provides an opportunity to attenu-  
ate external noise sources. It is commonly accepted that for some  
noise sources such as commercial noise and industrial noise, inter-  
nal noise levels within an affected building should be calculated  
in relation to an open window. In many other instances such as  
transportation noise in particular, the assessment of internal noise  
levels can be calculated with closed windows. If we take the glaz-  
ing element to be the dictating factor in the acoustic insulation of a  
façade, it can be used as the means by which façade insulation can  
be specified.  
A wide range of acoustic performance data is published by most  
glazing manufacturers and will normally detail frequency perfor-  
mance levels along with average or single figure values. When  
assessing the acoustic performance of a glazing unit for road traf-  
fic noise protection, it is best to base an assessment on the RTRA  
criteria. This is the reduction \(R\) in noise level provided by the  
glazing unit when adjusted for a road traffic noise spectrum \(TRA\).  
Table VI details the expected insulation values for some typical  
glazing specifications. In addition, it shows expected levels of  
reduction \(Dw\) from open windows dependant on the source noise. **D dB**

The stiffness of a partition affects how it will transmit sound at  
lower frequencies. Materials naturally resist sound pressure waves,  
and the greater the stiffness or rigidity, the less the material will  
move in response to lower frequency pressure wave.

tic insulation between floors despite the apparently slim section of  
concrete slab. The profiles act as stiffeners to the floor structure.  
Increased horizontal bracing in a timber floor help improve the  
stiffness of a floor.  
# 5.3 Isolation of a structure  
Separating \(or isolating\) the different elements of a structure using  
an air cavity can break the sound transmission paths, like a break  
in a circuit board. The deeper the isolating cavity, the greater the  
isolation. In narrow cavities, the air can act as a tie between two  
independent leaves. Isolation is particularly important for light-  
weight wall constructions and impact sound insulation.  
Impact resistant mats, isolated floor battens and floating floor  
systems all help to isolate a structure from impact sound. Isolation  
will also reduce airborne sound transmission through twin stud  
wall systems and independent ceiling or wall linings.  
# 5.4 Mass of a structure  
The more mass a material or structure has, the more difficult it will  
be for a sound pressure wave to force it to vibrate. For most mate-  
rials, mass is the defining factor in acoustic performance. For every  
doubling of mass in a structure or material, we should see a 6 dB  
improvement in acoustic insulation. This will only be noticed at  
the mass-controlled frequencies. This normally occurs at the mid  
range of frequencies.  
# 5.5 Absorption within a structure  
By adding absorbent materials to cavities within a partition, we reduce  
the reverberant sound therein and the transmitted sound energy. This  
is normally achieved by adding acoustically porous materials such as  
mineral fibre quilt. The inclusion of such materials can improve the  
acoustic insulation of a partition by between 3 to 6 dB.  
# 5.6 Flanking sound affecting a structure  
Sound always takes the path of least resistance. Flanking sound  
transmission relates to noise that does not come directly through  
the separating construction and can include airborne \(interconnect-  
ing spaces\) and structural paths \(common structural elements\). It  
is possible for there to be at least 12 flanking transmission paths  
between two rooms other than directly through a separating con-  
struction such as flanking via wall, floor and ceiling elements.  
Flanking transmission can be a particular problem with masonry-  
supported timber separating floors, where there is a strong structural  
connection between flats due to continuous masonry walls running  
up through a building, Figure 10.4.  
# 4 REDUCING SOUND TRANSMISSION THROUGH  
# LAYOUT AND DESIGN  
The layout of a building interior can either enhance or reduce its  
suitability in controlling noise. It is good practice to locate noise  
sensitive activities away from noisy activities. Early consideration  
of noise can provide economical design solutions.  
In domestic buildings, an increase in single living and shift  
working, coupled with the ability of homeowners to generate  
high levels of base intensive noise, have increased the likelihood  
for noise issues to arise between neighbours. In civic buildings,  
it is often possible to put ancillary storage cupboards as buffers  
between opposing room uses. Aligned room use is recommended.  
The following should be considered in order to reduce noise  
issues from building users\:  
• Avoid placing noise sensitive activities next to rooms with  
higher levels of noise.  
• Avoid detailing services \(such as soil vent pipe or heating, venti-  
lation and air conditioning\) through noise sensitive spaces.  
• Avoid placing rooms with heavy service demands or high activ-  
ity above quiet rooms \(e.g. kitchens above sleeping areas\).  
• Locate external bin areas away from noise sensitive rooms.  
• Avoid locating lift shafts in areas where they directly back onto  
noise sensitive rooms.  
• Place plant rooms and building services in as remote a location  
as practical from a noise sensitive area.  
• Fire doors in communal corridors should be located away from  
the entrance doors to dwellings or noise sensitive rooms.  
• Avoid locating rooms with high occupancy at the end of cor-  
ridors where there is greater potential to cause disturbance to  
adjacent noise sensitive rooms.  
# 5 REDUCING SOUND TRANSMISSION THROUGH  
# A STRUCTURE  
# 5.1 Principle  
Airborne sound transmission through a structure is the passage of  
the sound pressure wave from the air, into the structure, through the  
structure and then out the other side. Low frequency noise pushes  
the whole structure causing the sound pressure wave to be transmit-  
ted by the surface of the wall or floor. As we move up the frequency  
range, the wavelength of the sound gets shorter and so instead of  
being able to force the whole partition into motion the sound finds  
paths through the structure. Sound will also find ways of transmit-  
ting through small gaps or voids within the structure or through  
weaker flanking elements such as adjoining walls or service runs.  
There are six key factors in the reduction of sound through a  
building structure. By taking cognisance of these six issues when  
specifying a partition, be it a floor, wall, roof or external cladding  
**10.4** *Flanking paths through separating wall* **10-6 Sound**  
# 5.5 Completeness of a structure  
Without a complete structure, sound can leak through any gaps or  
holes in the same way that water would leak through the cracks  
in a dam. In addition to gaps or holes, incompleteness will have a  
similar effect. In some instances, this can be a result of poor work-  
manship such as badly finished joints, but it can be attributed to  
poor detailing such as wall head details or detailing of service pen-  
etrations.  
# 6 PERMISSIBLE NOISE LEVELS WITHIN  
# A BUILDING  
# 6.1 Defining levels  
It often falls to the lead designer on a project to outline suitable  
performance parameters and criteria for permissible noise levels  
within a building. The required levels will depend upon the client’s  
requirement, the expected use of the building and the types of room  
within a building. Defining the most suitable parameter to use is  
the first task of any design process. There are two main perfor-  
mance parameters that should normally be applied\: The Ambient  
Noise \(LAeq\), outlined in Section 3, and/or the Noise Rating \(NR\)  
parameter. In addition, the maximum noise level \(LAmax\), outlined  
in Section 3, is often applied.  
# 6.2 Noise rating curves  
NR is the Noise Rating Curve. This is commonly applied to steady  
or tonal noise sources \(e.g. fixed plant and equipment\). The NR  
criteria sets a maximum noise limit for each frequency band rather  
than setting a maximum average noise level as is the case with the  
LAeq parameter. Fixed noise sources such as plant and machinery  
are known for having high levels of noise at a particular frequency  
and so it is important to have a performance parameter that sets a  
maximum level at each frequency band. If an average noise level  
were set, such as the LAeq criteria, then it could be possible for noise  
from a fan to meet an LAeq criteria but still be perceived as disturb-  
ing due to a tonal emission at a particular frequency. Figure 10.5  
details the NR curves.  
# 6.3 Guidance on performance criteria by room type  
Table VII details suitable ambient noise levels and suitable NR lev-  
els for a range of building and room types.  
The guidance given in the table is an amalgamation of current  
performance criteria from the most relevant guidance documents  
\(Building Bulletin 93, HTM08–01, BS8233, CSDG2007. CTDG  
2019\. BCO Guidance 2011&2014\).  
# 6.4 Maximum or impulsive noise levels  
The control of impulsive noise events is also worthy of consid-  
eration in building design as such noises can be distracting and  
interrupt activities including sleep. This is normally described by  
the parameter LAmax, the A-weighted maximum noise level recorded  
during a measurement period although the LA1,30min parameter is  
used for schools. These parameters should be considered when  
assessing noise sources which may include a sudden short duration  
noise or individual high noise events. Examples of this would be  
trains passing by or bangs from industrial sources. These param-  
eters are not normally used in isolation but in conjunction with  
the LAeq or even the NR criteria. It is generally only reasonable  
to enforce maximum parameters in situations where sudden noise  
events occur regularly and during the night-time periods \(11pm to  
7am\), although there are some exceptions. ‘Regularly’ is normally  
taken to mean more than twice in any single hour \(daytime\) or  
more than 10 times during the night-time period. Table VIII defines  
some appropriate LAmax and LA1,30min performance criteria to avoid  
disturbance.

# 7 SOUND INSULATION PERFORMANCE  
# PARAMETERS  
Detailing the correct performance parameter for separating partitions  
has become a more complex task since the advent of guidance doc-  
uments such as Approved Document E, Building Bulletin 93 and  
Health Technical Memorandum 08–01. This is because different  
terms are used to define acoustic insulation. For example, airborne  
laboratory tests on a sample partition are normally defined as the  
Rw value \(the weighted sound reduction\) while testing on site in  
Scotland the DnT,w term is used \(difference in transmitted sound\) and  
in England and Wales the DnT,w + Ctr term is used \(the difference in  
transmitted sound adjusted using a Ctr traffic noise weighted adapta-  
tion term\).  
It is also important to know whether airborne sound insulation  
or impact sound has been measured. As a general rule, any param-  
eter which starts with ‘D’ or ‘R’ \(Dn,Tw, R’w, Dw etc.\) will be an  
airborne sound test while any parameter which starts with an ‘L’  
\(Ln’T,w, L’nw, ΔLw\) will be an impact sound test.  
Simply stating a dB requirement for the acoustic insulation of a  
partition can cause confusion as it does not describe the method by  
which the partition is to be assessed \(e.g. the difference in on site  
performance between specifying a partition with a DnTw of 50 dB  
compared to a partition with a DnT,w+Ctr of 50 dB can be more than  
10 dB\). Therefore it is necessary to state the performance param-  
eter \(Dn,Tw, R’w, etc.\) as well as the performance criteria \(45 dB,  
50 dB etc\).  
The most commonly used parameters are listed in Table IX out-  
lining what they mean and where they are used.  
# 8 SOUND INSULATION PERFORMANCE  
# CRITERIA  
# 8.1 Airborne and impact sound transmission  
The level of insulation required is set as a performance criterion  
and stated in dB. For example, if we were undertaking sound insu-  
lation testing in England and Wales we know that the performance  
parameter is DnT’w  
+Ctr but if we were testing in Northern Ireland  
the performance parameter is DnT,w. As these parameters determine  
the way in which the result is calculated, the resultant dB level is  
likely to be different. For example, if we test a blockwork wall and  
calculate the insulation value using the DnT,w  
+Ctr parameter, we may  
get a dB level of 45. But if it were to calculate the result using the  
DnT,w parameter we may get a dB level of 52 dB.  
Because airborne and impact sound measurements are con-  
ducted differently, there is a difference in how we determine what  
is a good result for airborne sound insulation than for impact sound  
insulation\:  
• Airborne sound insulation values are always set as **minimum**  
performance levels \(a measurement of level difference\)  
• Impact sound insulation values are always set as **maximum** per-  
formance levels \(a measurement of the resultant level\).  
Therefore for airborne sound insulation, the higher the result the bet-  
ter. But for impact sound insulation, the lower the result the better.

Under the Home Quality Mark, it is possible to gain credentials  
without testing on site if the Robust Details scheme is adopted and  
the relevant constructions are used. In order to gain multiple credits,  
the correct Robust Detail partition must be specified. Details of the  
number of credits that can be achieved for each partition type can  
be found on the Robust Details website \(www.robustdetails.com\).  
In Scotland, the Section 7, Sustainability, document of the  
building regulations sets out a gold, silver and bronze credit scheme  
based on acoustic performance as outlined in Table XII.

\# Internal partition requirements in ADE and Part G are only for partitions which  
separate rooms for sleeping purposes from other rooms and exclude walls between  
bedrooms and circulation spaces, and bedrooms to their own en suite. In Section 5, the  
requirement applies to any partition which forms a room for sleeping purposes with the  
exception of en suite partitions attached to the bedroom.  
means that the higher the value the better the performance. The min-  
imum requirement for each lining system is listed here\:  
• Bonded resilient coverings on concrete floors – ΔLw 17 dB  
• Floating floor treatments on concrete floors – ΔRw 5 dB; ΔLw 22 dB  
• Floating floor treatments on timber floors – ΔRw 17 dB; ΔRw+Ctr  
13 dB; ΔLw 16 dB  
• Resilient ceiling bars on timber floors – ΔRw 16 dB; ΔRw+Ctr  
14 dB; ΔLw 16 dB.  
# 8.5 School performance criteria  
The guidance offered in this section is based on the performance  
criteria set out in Building Bulletin 93. Table XIII details the DnT,w  
airborne sound insulation requirements for school developments.  
Table XIV details the impact sound insulation requirements for  
schools. The impact requirement for each room would be for the  
floor above the room in question so that the room is protected from  
impact sound to the prescribed level.  
Note\: An adjustment is made to the T0 \(reference RT\) to the  
design RT parameter \(Tmf,max\) of a space for both airborne and  
impact sound insulation.  
# 8.6 School performance criteria – corridor/circulation  
# space walls  
For schools, it is accepted that the level of sound insulation for cor-  
ridor walls, separating rooms from circulation spaces which have  
doors or glazing in them, would not be testable on site. Therefore,  
a performance criterion based on laboratory performance is pro-  
vided. Laboratory test data provides the bases of evidence that a  
partition specification is suitable for use.

Or alternatively, the composite insulation \(including ventila-  
tor, partition and glazing\) should be no more than 7 dB below the  
aforementioned requirements, while doorset requirements remain  
the same.  
# 8.7 Hospital performance criteria  
The guidance offered in this section is based on the performance  
criteria set out in Health Technical Memorandum 08–01.  
*Impact sound insulation* – Guidance for impact insulation given  
in HTM08–01 is limited and recommends that the aim should be  
to avoid locating heavy traffic areas above sensitive spaces such  
as wards. The performance requirement set is a maximum L’nT,w  
of 65 dB.  
*Airborne sound insulation* – Table XV details the DnTw airborne  
sound insulation requirements for hospital developments.  
Locating rooms adjacent to one another, which will result in a  
partition that requires a DnT,w of 57 dB, should be avoided but where  
# Sound 10-11  
unavoidable should be achieved as a minimum. Where it is not pos-  
sible to meet the minimum acoustic absorption requirements within  
a receiver room \(set out in Section 10\) then the level of insulation  
for the partitions in these areas should be increased by 3 dB.  
# 8.8 Hospital performance criteria – corridor/circulation  
# space walls  
The level of sound insulation for corridor walls separating rooms  
from circulation spaces which have doors or glazing in them would  
not be testable on site. Therefore, a performance criterion based  
on laboratory performance should be set. Laboratory test data can  
be used as evidence that a partition specification is suitable for  
use. For all rooms to circulation spaces the minimum requirement  
would be Rw 40–45 dB for the wall and Rw 30–35 dB for the door  
set respectively.  
# 8.9 Performance criteria for civic buildings  
Guidance for many civic buildings may be ad hoc, however guid-  
ance for sound insulation is provided in the Courts Standards and  
Design Guide 2007 \(CSDG\) document which outlines reasonable  
performance specifications for airborne and impact sound insula-  
tion. Table XVI details the airborne insulation requirements while  
Table XVII details the impact requirements.  
# 8.10 Performance criteria for other building types  
Sound insulation in other building types is often disregarded until  
there is an issue. Nevertheless, it remains important in offices,  
cinemas and other building types, for their intended function.  
Table XVIII outlines good practice for airborne sound insulation  
in a variety of building types. Performance standards given for  
office accommodation are taken from the BCO Guide to Fit Out  
2011.  
# 8.11 Broadcasting  
The guidance requirements for commercial recording studios and  
television broadcast studios is considered a highly specialised area  
and should be considered the remit of acoustic consultant or spe-  
cialist design consultant. Further guidance can be found in BBC  
Engineering’s ‘Guide to Acoustic Practice’.  
# 9 SPECIFYING AIRBORNE AND IMPACT INSULA-  
# TION FROM LABORATORY TEST DATA  
# 9.1 Laboratory to site  
It can often be difficult to find site performance data for a parti-  
tion, and so a designer may have to rely on test data gathered from  
laboratory testing. In most instances, airborne and impact sound  
insulation is measured in a suppressed flanking laboratory. This  
type of laboratory reduces the effects of the other sound paths  
between the two test rooms \(see Section 5\) so that only the perfor-  
mance of the specimen partition is tested.  
In order to assess if the laboratory performance of a partition  
is good enough to be used on site it is necessary to adjust the lab-  
oratory result. The level of adjustment required is partly based on  
the performance parameter that is used on site \(DnT,w, DnT,w+Ctr etc\)  
and the anticipated effects of flanking. For these estimations to be  
meaningful it is assumed that the partition specification used on  
site is identical to that tested in the laboratory and that there are no  
workmanship variances on site.  
# 9.2 Domestic performance conversions  
The following rules of thumb are normally applied when converting  
site performance requirements to laboratory performance levels\:  
Site DnT,w = Lab Rw +5 dB for masonry partitions  
Site DnT,w = Lab R +7 dB for light weight partitions  
w  
Site DnT,w+Ctr = Lab Rw +Ctr + 10 dB for masonry partitions  
Site DnT,w+Ctr = Lab Rw +Ctr + 15 dB for lightweight partitions. **10-12 Sound**

Notes\:  
1 The MSLD \(Mean Sound Level Difference\) considers the octave frequency range  
250 Hz to 4 kHz. The DnT,w equivalent would provide commensurate results.  
2 Cinema ambient noise requirements and flanking sound control between adjoining  
cinemas take precedent in the design of these partitions.  
3 It is normal for additional acoustic insulation to be required in such situations and is  
usually detailed during the planning phase.  
# 9.3 Hospital performance conversions  
# \(laboratory to site\)  
For hospitals, the HTM08–01 document suggests that additional  
care be taken when specifying partitions with relevance to room  
volume. Plasterboard and blockwork suppliers normally give  
performance results in Rw \(laboratory tests\). To determine the cor-  
respondent DnT,w value \(site performance\) a conversion must be  
made.  
The minimum that should be added is +5 dB for heavy con-  
structions and +7 dB for lightweight constructions however, as the  
room width reduces the level of insulation that a wall would have  
to provide under laboratory conditions increases in order to provide  
the required level of insulation on site.  
For standard cuboid receiving rooms, the following equations  
are used to convert DnT,w to R values\: w  
• Lightweight walls/floors\:  
*R*w ≡ *D*nT,w−10 log *d* + 14  
• Masonry walls/floors\:  
*R* w ≡ *D*nT,w−10 log *d* + 11.  
Where d is the dimension of the receiving room perpendicular  
to the separating partition.  
# 9.4 School performance conversions  
For schools projects, the DnT,w parameter discussed in 9.02 and  
9.03 is normalised \(T0, reference RT\) to the design RT parameter  
\(Tmf,max\) of a space. The Tmf,max parameter sets a maximum RT to  
be used in the calculation of the result \(i.e. substituting T0 = 0.5  
seconds\). If the correct RT within a room is not achieved it will  
have an effect on the overall sound insulation performance of the  
partition. **10-14 Sound**  
While it is suitable to use the rules of thumb outlined in Sections  
9.02 \(+5 and +7 dB added to the Rw value depending upon the  
partition type\) this will only be credible if the correct RT in the  
receiving room is also achieved \(see Section 10\).  
# 9.5 Perception of sound insulation values  
Table XIX details the perceived relationship between the level of  
sound insulation offered by a partition and how speech would be  
perceived in the adjoining room.

# 10 REVERBERATION CRITERIA  
# 10.1 Parameters  
Two performance parameters are normally set when considering  
RT in a room. Either the room must not exceed a maximum RT  
or a minimum area of acoustically absorbent material should be  
specified within the room. For the second parameter described, it  
is also normal to dictate the minimum level of absorption offered  
by the material.  
# 10.2 Reverberation times  
For rooms intended for speech, the RT, given in seconds, can  
be considered as the average RT for the octave frequency bands  
500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz or an average of 400–2500 kHz  
one-third results.  
Table XX details the required maximum RTs for a range of  
rooms. Instances where an alternative frequency range should be  
used are noted in the table.

# 10.3 Optimum reverberation times in performance spaces  
For performance spaces including churches, the optimum RT will  
differ dependent upon the type of performance, \(speech, music\) the  
type of building and the volume of the space. Figure 10.6 gives  
guidance values for RTs in some common performance spaces  
\(William Cavanaugh et al, BS 8233, Ballou\).  
These guidance levels show the optimum RT dependant on  
room volume at the 500 Hz frequency bandwidth. Achieving these  
RTs will be dependent on specialist acoustic design. General guid-  
ance on this subject is given in Section 11.  
# 10.4 Minimum area of absorption  
The other performance parameter commonly used is to define the  
minimum area of absorption required for a space, and to define the  
absorption classification of the material. This is used in hospital  
developments or in circulation spaces \(e.g. in schools or stairwells  
in domestic developments\). **10.6** *Reverberation vs volume criteria in performance spaces*  
*\(500 Hz\)*  
The absorption classification of a material is defined in BS EN  
ISO 11654 at each frequency as the άs and as a single figure value  
as the άw. From this, the classification of a material is rated from  
A-E, with Class A absorbent material being the highest classifi-  
cation with the most absorption, and Class E materials being the  
lowest classification with the least absorption.  
Table XXI details the likely absorbent classification and area  
requirement for particular room types.

# 11 GENERAL GUIDANCE ON THE ACOUSTICS OF  
# PERFORMANCE SPACES  
When designing performance spaces such as auditoria and theatre,  
it is always advisable to involve a specialist in building acoustics.  
However, there are some basic guidance rules that the non-special-  
ist designer should be aware of to allow them to begin the initial  
design\:  
• Halls for music performance require a minimum of 8 m3 per  
audience member.  
• Halls for theatres or cinemas require a minimum of 4 m3 per  
audience member.  
• Rectangular shaped halls with high ceilings are normally pref-  
erable; fan shaped halls normally provide poor acoustics for  
musical performances.  
• Domes and barrel vaults can cause focusing and should be  
avoided or treated with additional absorption.  
• Acoustic scattering treatments are recommended for side walls.  
Side wall diffusion will increase the musical clarity.  
• A proscenium stage enclosure will benefit the balance and  
ensemble of orchestrations.  
• Large overhangs or balconies will reduce the quality of sound  
reaching those seated below. The depth of an overhang should  
not exceed the height between the floor and the underside of the  
overhang.  
• Shallow pitched roofs can cause flutter effects.  
• Seating should be arranged to allow for a clear line of site to the  
performance space for acoustic as well as visual reasons. This  
should help to ensure the same acoustics each seat.  
• Steeply raked seating should be avoided particularly for musical  
performance spaces.  
• The walls, floor and ceiling around the performance space should  
preferably be acoustically reflective. Acoustic absorption in this  
area should be avoided.  
• For music performance spaces, the acoustic absorption provided  
by unoccupied seating should be as similar as possible to when  
the seats are occupied. Upholstered seating is best. Where tip-up  
seating is used, it is preferable to upholster the underside of the  
seat.  
• Background noise levels should be kept to a minimum. The  
acoustic performance of the building envelope is important when  
designing in noisy \(city centre\) areas.  
• Plant and machinery should be as quiet as possible.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 General principles  
When designing a building with fire safety in mind, particularly  
means of escape, it is important not to forget usability and security  
needs. The fire strategy should be practical in use, reasonable and  
manageable. If the fire measures are seen to be too onerous \(for  
example, a multiplicity of fire doors\), they will be circumvented  
and their purpose will be frustrated. Fire and security need not con-  
flict, and every effort should be made to design out any conflict.  
Buildings should be accessible to all persons. It is therefore  
necessary to ensure that adequate measures are incorporated to  
facilitate the aided or unaided escape of persons who find steps a  
barrier, or who will find evacuation during a fire difficult or impos-  
sible without assistance.  
# 1.2 Legislation and guidance review  
While the contents of this chapter are correct at the time of going to  
press, it should be noted that all fire safety legislation and guidance is  
under review in response to the Grenfell Tower fire of June 14, 2017.  
The initial review was detailed in the Hackitt Report published  
May 2018. The Building Regulations and Approved Document B  
were subsequently amended and a draft Fire Safety Bill has been  
issued. At the time of writing, both this bill and the draft Building  
Safety Bill, were progressing through Parliament. Both bills are sub-  
ject to amendment. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local  
Government \(MHCLG\) and the Home Office websites and \(www.  
parliament.uk\) should be checked for their progress and outcome.  
# 2 COMPONENTS OF FIRE  
# 2.1 Combustion  
Fire is combustion producing heat and light. Combustion will  
occur and continue if three factors are present\: oxygen, heat and  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-13  
# CI/Sfb \(K\)  
fuel. These are generally referred to as the combustion triangle,  
Figure 11.1.  
**11.1** *Combustion triangle*  
# 2.2 Extinguishment  
Fire can be extinguished by removing one component of the com-  
bustion triangle\:  
• Starve or limit the fuel by removing it  
• Extinguish by limiting or stopping the further supply of oxygen  
• Remove or stop the heat source; cool by dissipating the heat  
faster than it is generated.  
# 2.3 Heat source  
A source of heat comes into contact with a combustible material \(the  
fuel\) which ignites and supports combustion while oxygen is present.  
The heat sources within a building are many, for example, cooking,  
smoking, heating equipment, overheating/faulty equipment.  
# 2.4 Fuel  
This can take many forms\:  
• Combustible materials that will support burning following igni-  
tion \(e.g. timber, certain insulation materials, plastics\)  
• Flammable liquids  
• Flammable gases given off from substances when at ambient  
temperature or when heated.  
The fuel may be present in the building structure, fittings and/or  
contents and can be in the form of solids, liquids or gases. Most  
organic materials will burn. Certain materials spontaneously com-  
bust under specific environmental conditions and care is required  
in their storage, for example, linseed oil, certain chemicals, grains,  
waste materials. Certain industrial processes involving high levels  
of dust, for example, printing or flour mills, can result in flash fires.  
Specialist advice should be sought in respect of these matters.  
# 2.5 Risk of fire  
Risk results from the presence of a hazard. While it is virtually impos-  
sible to remove all hazards from a building, they can be significantly  
reduced by careful choice of materials and management control.  
The hazard can result from\:  
• The use to which the building is put  
• The materials it is constructed from in relation to its use  
**11-1** **11-2 Fire safety**  
• The way the building is laid out/subdivided  
• Possibly its location – remote from emergency assistance and an  
adequate water supply.  
It should be noted that electricity in itself will not cause fire\: it  
needs to cause heat and be in contact with a combustible material,  
for example, combustible insulation or cable, or to produce a spark  
or arcing that comes into contact with combustible material.  
# 2.6 Smoke  
This is formed when heated organic materials decompose, giving  
off tar-like and sooty materials. It is likely that most smoke will  
be generated by the building contents. Again, the risk of smoke to  
people \(including firefighters\) and damage/contamination of a build-  
ing’s contents can be significantly reduced. The latter is of particular  
concern where the contents are valuable, rare or sensitive to envi-  
ronmental change/pollution, for example, data centres, galleries and  
museums. See BS EN 16893 *Conservation of Cultural Heritage –*  
*Specifications for location, construction and modification of buildings*  
*or rooms intended for the storage or use of heritage collections*.  
# 2.7 Heat  
This can be transmitted in three forms\:  
• *Conduction* – heat energy is passed from one molecule to the  
next. The conductivity of a material \(which varies with the mate-  
rial\) may affect the fire resistance of a component or structure. A  
steel member in contact with combustible materials may trans-  
fer the heat generating a fire or damage away from the original  
source.  
• *Radiation* – heat is transmitted in straight lines without any  
contact between the radiating material and the target that may  
absorb or reflect the heat. The intensity reduces inversely as the  
square of the distance from the source of radiation. Combustible  
materials placed in close proximity to a radiant fire will ignite.  
• *Convection* – only occurs in liquids and gases. The heated com-  
bustion gases become buoyant and rise through voids and shafts  
with the potential to cause ignition in other areas of a building.  
# 3 PRINCIPLES OF FIRE PROTECTION  
# 3.1 Potential problems  
• Unrestricted growth and spread of a fire within a building that  
will affect life safety, cause extensive damage and may result in  
its collapse  
• Rapid spread of fire across surfaces within the building and igni-  
tion of adjacent fuels may result in the means of escape being  
prejudiced  
• Spread of fire, smoke and hot gases in a building through ducts,  
voids and shafts affecting the means of escape, access for fire-  
fighters and causing extensive damage to decorations and  
property  
• Spread of fire to adjacent buildings affecting life safety and  
property  
• Loss of contents, disruption of work, loss of trade/production.  
# 3.2 Fire precautions  
The aim of fire precautions within a building is to inhibit/restrict  
the growth and spread of any fire. The influencing factors are\:  
• Size of building – area, height, volume  
• Layout, configuration and complexity within the building  
• Uses accommodated, and the requirements of the occupants  
• Construction materials, linings and claddings  
• Type of construction  
• Services installed  
• Furniture.  
Appropriate precautions include\:  
• Protection of the loadbearing structure to prevent untimely col-  
lapse; limitation of combustibility of key structural elements  
• Automatic and manual fire alarms to give warning of fire  
• Adequate and appropriate provisions for means of escape  
• Access for firefighters up to and through the building to reach the  
seat of the fire and promptly extinguish it  
• Compartmentation and separation to restrict spread of fire; main-  
tenance of these by the protection of openings, fire stopping and  
cavity barriers within concealed spaces  
• Safe installation and maintenance of services, heat-producing  
equipment and user equipment  
• Separation of different uses to protect, for example, a risk to  
sleepers from commercial uses  
• Enclosure of high risks with fire-resisting construction to protect  
adjacent areas  
• Active fire suppression installations to detect and/or contain fire  
in its early stages and restrict its spread and growth  
• Limitation of flame spread by selective use of materials  
• Fire-resisting external walls and/or space separation to prevent  
spread of fire to adjacent properties; protection of openings in  
external walls; limited flame spread across external walls and  
roofs; use of insulation with limited combustibility to restrict  
ignition and spread  
• Smoke extraction and/or smoke control measures to facilitate  
means of escape and firefighting  
• Management training and procedures for evacuation, mainte-  
nance of fire precautions, risk analysis, management policy.  
# 3.3 Fire load and ignitability  
The majority of a fire load within a building will be its contents, over  
which a designer may have no influence. Some types of occupan-  
cies have controls relating to the ignitability of furniture \(domestic  
and assembly buildings under furniture safety regulations, hospi-  
tals and prisons under Government directives\). See Table I for the  
various occupancies addressed under the Building Regulations.  
Electricity, often cited as the cause of fires, presents a potential  
hazard when brought into contact with combustible material. All  
new electrical installations should be installed in accordance with  
the current edition of the regulations of the Institution of Electrical  
Engineers and existing installations periodically examined and  
tested for potential risks.  
# 3.4 Smoke  
The limitation of smoke spread is considered mainly as an aspect  
of safe means of escape. Specific limitations of smoke production  
are not, to date, generally specified. There is no generally accepted  
test related to smoke emission. The production of toxic gases that  
accompanies all fires would be very difficult to specify.  
Smoke also presents a significant issue for firefighters during  
firefighting and rescue operations, particularly in tall, complex  
and high-risk buildings. Smoke spread may be limited by sepa-  
ration \(fire resistant smoke retardant construction\), or by natural  
or mechanical ventilation with safeguards for high temperature  
smoke.  
# 3.5 Combustibility  
While it would be possible to construct a totally non-combustible  
building, it is not practical and not required by legislation, although  
some codes do relate means of escape to a classification based  
on the ‘combustibility’ of a building. Non-combustible materi-  
als should be used where hazardous conditions are anticipated or  
where there is a need to maintain the integrity of a structure for the  
maximum time, for example, a compartment wall or floor, or an  
escape stair in a high building.  
The 2018 amendments \(England\) to Building Regulation 7 –  
Materials and Workmanship, required that the external walls of **Fire safety 11-3**  
“relevant buildings” and “specified attachment” thereto must be  
European classification A2-s1, d0 or A1, \(limited combustibil-  
ity or non-combustible respectively\), in accordance with BS EN  
13501\:2007 as amended *Fire classification of construction prod-*  
*ucts and building elements*.  
# 3.6 Fire resistance  
The need for a degree of fire resistance within a structure may be  
dictated by Building Regulations, insurance or damage-limitation  
requirements. The prevention of untimely collapse allows evacu-  
ation, containment of a fire and therefore protection of adjacent  
areas, and access for firefighters. This is essential in high-rise  
buildings. Factors relating to the need for fire resistance are build-  
ing height and size, occupancy type and anticipated fire severity.  
While a period of fire resistance may be specified and an element  
constructed accordingly, it should not be assumed that the period  
will be attained. It may be longer or shorter due to, among other  
factors, interaction with other elements or non-maintenance, or  
more severe fire conditions than those anticipated in the test.  
# 3.7 Fire compartments \(compartmentation\)  
The term fire compartment is widely used, and sometimes incor-  
rectly, to describe any area enclosed by fire-resisting construction.  
In terms of Building Regulations, it has a specific definition as set  
out in Approved Document B\: *A building or part of a building,*  
*comprising one or more rooms, spaces, or storeys, constructed to*  
*prevent the spread of fire to or from another part of the same build-*  
*ing, or an adjoining building. \(A roof space above the storey of*  
*a compartment is included in that compartment.\)* Maximum sizes  
of compartment and which walls and floors should be designed as  
compartment walls and floors are set out in current guidance \(see  
Approved Document B, and BS 9991 and BS 9999\). The construc-  
tion of a compartment wall is specified within guidance in terms  
that include the minimising of deflection and the protection of  
openings.  
Compartmentation divides an area into a size in which it is  
considered a fire could be contained and dealt with by firefighters,  
thereby protecting adjacent areas. The addition of automatic fire  
suppression such as sprinklers to contain and control the growth of  
a fire allows larger compartments or, in some cases, their omission.  
If the only consideration is life safety, it can be argued that if all  
persons can safely escape there is no need for compartmentation,  
and the potential exists for reduced fire resistance. This principle is  
often adopted in low-rise or single storey buildings. However, in  
the case of blocks of flats/maisonettes, high-rise buildings or those  
with phased or staged evacuation, compartmentation is an essential  
part of the safety package.  
Flats and maisonettes are constructed such that every unit is a  
compartment. In the event of a fire, it is only necessary initially to  
evacuate the unit on fire.  
Effective compartmentation requires attention to detail.  
Openings, including those for ventilation and services, must be  
protected. Where shafts perforate compartment floors, ‘protected  
shafts’ should be detailed, see Table III.  
The following Tables I–III are taken from Approved Document  
B unless otherwise indicated. Reference is made primarily to  
Approved Document B \(England\) throughout, as this guidance is  
simple to follow and addresses most uses of buildings. However,  
more specific and detailed technical detail can be found in BS 9999  
on a number of the same issues.

Notes\:  
For single storey buildings, the periods under the heading ‘Up to 5’ apply if single storey buildings have basements, for the basement storeys the period appropriate to their  
depth applies.  
\* For the floor over a basement or, if there is more than one basement, the floor over the topmost basement, the higher of the period for the basement storey and the period for  
the ground or upper storey applies.  
† For compartment walls that separate buildings, the period is increased to a minimum of 60 minutes.  
+ For any floor that does not contribute to the support of the building within a flat of more than one storey, the period is reduced to 30 minutes.  
§ For flat conversions, refer to paragraphs 6.5 to 6.7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 regarding the acceptability of 30 minutes.  
‡ For elements that do not form part of the structural frame, the period is reduced to *9*0 minutes.  
\# For elements that protect the means of escape, the period is increased to 30 minutes.  
1 Refer to note 1, Table B3 for the specific provisions of test.  
2 Blocks of flats with a top storey more than 11 m above ground level \(see Diagram D6\) should be fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.  
Notes\: Sprinklers should be provided within the individual flats, they do not need to be provided in the common areas such as stairs, corridors or landings when these areas are  
fire sterile.  
3 ‘With sprinkler system’ means that the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.  
4 Very large \(with a top storey more than 18 m above ground level or with a 10 m deep basement\) or unusual dwelling.houses are outside the scope of the guidance provided  
with regard to dwelling houses.  
5 A minimum of 30 minutes in the case of three storey dwelling houses, increased to 60 minutes minimum for compartment walls separating buildings.  
6 Buildings within the ‘office’, ‘shop and commercial’, ‘assembly and recreation’, ‘industrial’ and ‘storage and other non-residential’ \(except car parks for light vehicles\) purpose  
groups \(purpose groups 3 to 7\(a\)\) require sprinklers where there is a top storey more than 30 m above ground level.  
7 The car park should comply with the relevant provisions in the guidance on requirement B3, Section 11.  
8 For the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, the following types of steel elements are deemed to have satisfied the minimum period of fire resistance of 15 minutes  
when tested to the European test method.  
i Beams supporting concrete floors, maximum Hp/A=230 m−1 operating under full design load.  
ii Free-standing columns, maximum Hp/A=180 m−1 operating under full design load.  
iii Wind bracing and struts, maximum Hp/A=210 m−1 operating under full design load.

*British Standards 9991 Fire safety in the design, management and*  
*use of residential buildings – Code of practice and BS 9999 Code*  
*of practice for fire safety in the design, management and use of*  
*buildings*  
Together, these provide recommendations for all the main types of  
buildings, referring users to other guidance for buildings of spe-  
cific or specialist use. For example, the guidance for hospitals and  
similar health care premises can be found in the Health Technical  
Memorandum 05–02\: *Firecode Guidance in support of functional*  
*provisions \(Fire safety in the design of healthcare premises\)* issued  
by the Department of Health.  
BS 9991 makes recommendations for residential buildings that  
are\:  
• Single family houses, self-contained flats or maisonettes  
• Residential blocks, students/hospital staff with individual bed-  
rooms and kitchen/sanitary within an individual single fire  
compartment  
• Specialised housing, for example, sheltered housing.  
It does not address hotels, mobile homes, residential care premises,  
hostels or prisons.  
Now under review, BS 9991 was last revised in 2015 and  
incorporates recommendations for open-plan apartments, which  
Approved Document B does not recommend as acceptable in all  
circumstances. There are also some differences between BS 9991  
and Approved Document B relating to the travel distances and  
smoke control measures for common areas.  
BS 9999 addresses the majority of all other buildings. Unlike  
Approved Document B, the level of protection recommended is  
dependent on the use risk profile and building height, the type of  
fire alarm, and any suppression installations to contain and reduce  
fire spread. Uses involving a sleeping risk generally require a  
higher standard of protection. Every building adopting the recom-  
mendations of BS 9999 must incorporate the outlined minimum  
level of protection. Where additional fire protection measures are  
incorporated \(e.g. automatic fire suppression and/or a fire alarm  
incorporating voice messages\), it is possible to vary/reduce \(within  
specific limits\) door and stair widths and increase travel distances.  
BS 9999 was published in 2017. It includes\:  
• A flowchart of sequential steps to aid design  
• Management levels  
• Water mist suppression  
• Recommendations for smoke and heat control  
• Recommendations for mechanical ventilation and air condition-  
ing systems  
• Recommendations for shopping complexes  
• Recommendations for atria.  
BS 9999 does not specifically address fire engineering – for this  
see BS 7974. However, BS 9999 is useful for complex and unusual  
buildings and can support a fire engineering package. **11-6 Fire safety**  
Any guidance or code should be used in its entirety – sections  
should not be ‘cherry picked’ to gain advantage. All the recom-  
mendations are interrelated and interdependent\: adequate structural  
fire resistance allows time for occupants to escape, undertake fire-  
fighting and if necessary search and rescue by the Fire and Rescue  
Service \(FRS\); warning informs of a fire and prompts people to  
evacuate; control of linings deters fire spread allowing time to  
reach an exit, as do cavity barriers by protecting against unseen  
spread of fire within the structure; adequate space separation deters  
fire spread between buildings; and Fire Service access facilitates  
firefighting.  
*Fire engineering*  
In its simplest form, fire engineering is a holistic overview of the  
risks and measures proposed to minimise such risk and where var-  
ious aspects complement each other. A solution may be complex  
and require specialist advice. However, an innovative or complex  
development may not require a complex fire-engineered solution.  
Adequate fire precautions do not need to inhibit innovation or  
design; but the cost or practicalities of the solution may be pro-  
hibitive.  
Approved Document B 2019 sets out the recommendations for  
surface spread of flame for internal linings, Table IV and Table V.  
The limitation on flame spread of linings is by reference to BS EN  
13501–1 classifications and should be read in conjunction with  
Appendix B *Performance of materials, products and structures* of  
Approved Document B \(both volumes\). This also provides infor-  
mation in relation to performance specifications and guidance for  
products lawfully available using the classification system set out  
in previous editions of Approved Document B by reference to  
British Standards – Table B1 *Reaction to fire classifications; trans-*  
*position to national class*.  
Previous editions of the document referred to classifications  
in accordance with the European classes and British Standards.  
For example, wall and ceiling linings\: BS 476 Part 7 1971, the  
results being classified 1 to 4 \(class 1 being very good, class 4  
very poor\) on the basis of flame spread from the point of igni-  
tion. Class 0 was a classification defined for the purposes of  
Approved Document B under the Building Regulations \(not a  
British Standard\).  
The spread of flame across the face of an external wall is  
addressed in Section 10 of Approved Document B Volume 1 and  
# 3.9 Fire spread  
Limiting the spread of fire within the main structural elements is  
generally relatively easy by choosing appropriate materials, pro-  
vided that they do not contain large voids. The addition of linings  
and claddings can facilitate the rapid spread of fire beyond its area  
of origin. This was spectacularly illustrated by the Grenfell Tower  
fire. Flame can spread quickly in all directions and fixings are  
important. It has been found by experiment that the better the mate-  
rial is as an insulator, the greater the likelihood that flame spread  
will be more rapid and extensive.  
**Table IV** **Classification of linings**  
**Location** **Classification**

3 Lighting diffusers of TP\(a\) flexible rating should be used only in panels of a maximum of 5 m2 each. See paragraph 6.18.  
4 There are no limits on the use of class D-s3, d2 materials in small rooms. See Table I.  
5 The minimum 3 m separation given in Diagram 6.2 between each 5 m2 group must be maintained. Therefore, in some cases, it may not be possible to use the maximum  
percentage quoted.  
6 Class D-s3, d2 rooflights to rooms in industrial and other non-residential purpose group buildings \(purpose groups 3 to 7\) may be spaced 1800 mm apart provided both of the  
following conditions are met.  
a\) The rooflights are evenly distributed.  
b\) The total area of the rooflights does not exceed 20% of the area of the room.

spread relates to the position of the wall relative to the boundary  
and the building use and height.  
# 3.11 Ventilation  
Ventilation to release heat and control and/or dispel smoke from a  
fire can protect an escape route and allow easier and rapid access  
by firefighters to extinguish a fire or rescue people. Its relationship  
to means of escape is outlined elsewhere.  
Smoke ventilation is required in\:  
• The common parts of residential accommodation to protect  
escape routes and firefighters  
• Certain lobbies to provide additional protection to escape routes  
• Firefighting shafts  
• Basements  
• Enclosed car parks  
• Possibly as part of a fire-engineered solution  
• Where smoke ventilation is a compensatory feature for a varia-  
tion from guidance.  
Ventilation can be natural or mechanical. The latter is prefera-  
ble as it is controllable, can be activated automatically and, when  
designed correctly, not influenced by wind, internal layout and con-  
figurations, outside temperature or stack effect. It does, however,  
add considerable cost, as it is necessary to safeguard its operation  
by using fans tolerant of high temperatures, protected wiring, fire  
and smoke dampers, automatic detection, secondary power sup-  
plies and monitoring. It may require sophisticated computerised  
controls. It will require ongoing maintenance.  
# 3.12 Mechanical smoke extract systems  
It is necessary to determine if the system is for smoke extraction  
\(usually to facilitate firefighting\) or smoke control \(to assist means  
of escape\). Comprehensive guidance can be found in BS 9999  
Section 27 *Heat and smoke control*. Pressure differential systems  
are addressed in BS EN 12101–6 *Smoke and heat control systems.*  
*Specification for pressure differential systems. Kits*. Currently,  
draft document BS EN 12101 Smoke and heat control systems.  
Part 13\: Pressure differential systems \(PDS\) – Design and calcu-  
lation methods, installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and  
maintenance, is under consideration. This draft document gives  
guidance and requirements for the design and calculation methods,  
installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and maintenance for  
pressure differential systems.  
Specific guidance on accepted forms of smoke control in res-  
idential accommodation \(based on current guidance in Approved  
Document B and BS 9991\) can be found in the document produced  
by the Smoke Control Association *Guidance on smoke control to*  
*common escape routes in apartment buildings \(flats and maison-*  
*ettes\) \(Revision 3.1, July 13, 2020\)*.  
For all but the simplest of code compliant systems, specialist  
advice should be sought.  
# 3.13 Natural ventilation  
Natural ventilation by the provision of open, openable or breakable  
vents is usually intended for operation by firefighters who will take  
into consideration aspects of wind etc. If vents are not accessible,  
they should be permanent, open automatically or open by remote  
control.  
# 3.14 Smoke control in large open areas  
Smoke control in large open areas such as atria, single storey facto-  
ries, auditoria, exhibition halls, shopping malls and the like may be  
required to facilitate escape and/or firefighting.  
BS 9999 contains general recommendations for the majority of  
uses, including atria. See also BRE publications Digest 260, *Smoke*  
# Fire safety 11-7  
*control in buildings\: design principles* and BR 186 *Design princi-*  
*ples for smoke ventilation in enclosed shopping centres*.  
Such smoke control measures may require specialist advice due  
to their complexity, and their complex control equipment.  
# 3.15 Access for fire fighters up to, into and through a  
# building  
Specific access for firefighters will allow their prompt action.  
Access is required up to, into and through a building. Various  
dimensional information is given in Tables VI and VII and Figures  
11.2–11.5, but it should be remembered that fire equipment is not  
standardised; it is constantly changing, giving variations in sizes  
and weights.  
If a building is provided with a fire main \(see Section 8.10\),  
access is required to within 18 m of the inlet to a dry riser or the  
access to a firefighting shaft containing a wet riser. The setdown  
point for the FRS appliance should be within sight of the dry riser  
inlet or shaft access.

• To serve a basement more than 10.0 m below the Fire Service  
access level, the shaft\(s\) should incorporate firefighting lift\(s\).  
• If there are two or more basement storeys, each a minimum of  
900 m2, the shafts do not need to include a firefighting lift.  
• A minimum of two firefighting shafts should be provided where  
a building has a storey with a floor area of 900 m2 or more and is  
at a height of more than 18.0 m above Fire Service access level.  
• At least two firefighting shafts \(not necessarily with firefighting  
lifts\) should be provided in premises of the ‘shop and commer-  
cial’, ‘assembly and recreation’ or ‘industrial’ purpose groups  
\(as set out in Approved Document B\), that have a storey area of  
900 m2 or more, and have a storey of 7.5 m or more above Fire  
Service access level.  
The layout and smoke control provisions required for firefight-  
ing shafts in residential and commercial premises differ. Refer

BS 9999 details the technical and dimensional specifications of  
a firefighting shaft. A firefighting lift can be one normally used for  
passengers; it should not be one used as a goods lift, see Figures  
11.6 and 11.7.

# 3.17 Signage to assist the Fire Service  
In blocks of flats with a top storey exceeding 11 m above ground  
level, floor identification signage and flat indicator signs should be  
provided. See Approved Document B Volume 1 2019 as amended,  
paragraphs 15.13–15.16.  
# 3.18 Fire spread beyond a site boundary  
The spread of fire to adjacent sites can be prevented by\:  
• Clear space  
• Fire-resisting walls  
• External walls of limited combustibility and limited surface  
spread of flame, and/or  
• Roof coverings resistant to penetration of fire.  
If precautions are taken within a building to limit a fire’s growth  
and spread, it can be assumed that its effects on an adjacent building  
are reduced. Openings in an external wall or walls having no fire  
resistance present weaknesses to an adjoining building by radiation  
and convection. If property protection in addition to life safety is a  
consideration, then all buildings should be considered as being of  
equal risk.  
External walls within 1000 mm from a relevant boundary \(as  
defined in Approved Document B\) should be fire resistant from  
both sides \(with the exception of small openings as set out in  
Approved Document B\). Walls more than 1000 mm from a rele-  
vant boundary but within the calculated required space separation  
distance should be fire resistant from the inside or have the open-  
ings protected against fire spread to the boundary.  
If life safety is the only factor, then residential, assembly and  
recreational uses are at greater risk from external fire sources and  
warrant additional safeguards. Such uses in themselves have a  
higher level of compartmentation and the risk from such uses is  
reduced. **Fire safety 11-11**

It is generally assumed that only one compartment is involved in  
a fire and as such the risk emanates only from its external enclosures.  
**Table IX** **Permitted unprotected areas in small buildings or compartments**  
# Minimum distance between side of building and relevant boundary \(m\)  
# 3.19 Protection to deter fire spread beyond the  
# boundary  
Methods generally used for determining the necessary degrees  
of protection to deter fire spread beyond the boundary are based  
on acceptable percentages of ‘unprotected areas’ \(openings,  
non-fire-resisting walls, combustible claddings and insulation\) hav-  
ing regard to heat radiation exposure from a known use. Guidance  
on calculation methods and acceptable space separation can be  
found in Section 11 \(Volume 1 dwellings\) and Section 13 \(Volume  
2 other than dwellings\) of Approved Document B. The document  
BR 187 *External fire spread\: building separation and boundary*  
*distance* sets out more precise methods of calculating the required  
space separation and how to address buildings with irregular enclo-  
sures. See Tables VIII and IX.

# 3.20 Cladding  
Combustible materials within the construction of an external wall  
may present an unacceptable risk. Detailed reference should be  
made to the recommendations of Approved Document B at the  
time of the design as they are currently subject to ongoing amend-  
ment. Approved Document B 2019 as amended makes specific  
recommendations in relation to the external walls and their spec-

Source\: from Approved Document B, Volume 2, Table 12.1  
Building Regulation 7 as amended, currently makes, amongst  
other matters, the following mandatory requirement for buildings  
with a storey at a height of 18.0 m above ground level and containing  
one or more dwellings, an institution or a room for residential pur-  
poses. This excludes any room in a hostel, hotel or boarding house.  
The requirement is that the external walls \(with the exception  
of certain components\) and certain attachments of a building must  
comprise of materials that are of European Classification A2-s1,  
d0 or A1, classified in accordance with BS EN 13501–1\:2007 as  
amended *Fire classification of construction products and building*  
*elements. Classification using test data from reaction to fire tests*.  
Any proposal to not comply fully with Regulation 7, will require  
an application to the local authority to relax or dispense with the  
regulation accompanied by full justification.  
BE EN 13501–1 sets out classifications based on actual fire test  
results; it also sets out the necessary test data required.  
*A specified attachment* is defined in Regulation 2 \(6\) as meaning\:  
\(i\) \(ii\) A balcony attached to the external wall  
A device attached to the external wall for the purpose of reduc-  
ing heat gain within the building by deflecting sunlight; or  
\(iii\) A solar panel attached to the external wall.  
# 3.21 Roof coverings  
Roof coverings \(not structures\) in close proximity to boundaries  
should have limited flame spread and penetration to fire. Burning  
brands from a fire landing on an adjacent roof should not readily  
cause another fire.  
The recommended standards and limitations for roof cover-  
ings, including those relating to rooflights, are set out in Approved  
Document B Volume 1\: Dwellings, Section 2 and Approved  
Document B Volume 2\: Buildings other than dwellings Section  
14\. The classification relates to the resistance of a roof to exter-  
nal penetration by fire – through the roof construction and the  
spread of flame over the roof surface – in accordance with BS EN  
13501–5 *Fire classification of construction products and building*  
*elements. Classification using data from external fire exposure to*  
*roof tests*.  
Where green roofs are to be used, their composition should fol-  
low the guidance within the document Fire Performance of *Green*  
*Roofs and Walls*, published by the MHCLG, 2013.  
Approved Document B sets out specific classification recom-  
mendations relating to distances from the boundary, see Tables XII  
for dwellings & XIII for non-dwellings. together with recommen-  
dations for plastic rooflights, Figure 11.12.

# 4 MEANS OF ESCAPE  
# 4.1 General  
In general terms, means of escape is the provision of safe routes for  
persons to travel from any point in a building to a place of safety.  
The place of safety is normally outside the building but can, in  
some circumstances, be to a separate compartment.  
# 4.2 Guidance  
There are three main guidance documents for means of escape\:  
• Approved Document B, Volumes 1 and 2  
• BS 9991 for residential buildings – houses, flats, maisonettes and  
other residential blocks  
# Fire safety 11-17  
• BS 9999 – generally applicable to buildings other than those res-  
idential buildings addressed in BS 9991.  
Whatever guidance is adopted, the means of escape must be  
tailored to the individual occupancy and building. Where a project  
is speculative, a judgement must be made as to the necessary pro-  
visions for means of escape. To assume the worst case may not be  
feasible, although it will result in a level of provision acceptable for  
the majority of occupancies.  
# 4.3 Basic principles  
The aim is to make provision such that escape can take place  
unaided. The occupants of some buildings, however, will not be  
able to achieve this and special measures are required.  
Certain basic principles and provisions are accepted as the min-  
imum necessary. These are\:  
• A means of raising the alarm and advising occupants of a fire  
• Exits and escape routes of adequate number and width within a  
reasonable distance of all points in the building  
• An alternative means of escape \(in the majority of cases\)  
• Protected escape routes where necessary  
• Lighting and directional signage  
• Readily openable exit doors  
• Smoke control \(if required\) to safeguard escape routes  
• Separation of high or special risks  
• Access for fire brigade to attack the seat of a fire swiftly for pro-  
tection of life  
• Portable hand fire appliances for use by trained personnel  
• Instruction of action to be taken in the event of a fire and evac-  
uation procedure  
• In all but the simplest of buildings, a management strategy to  
safeguard and maintain these measures.  
# 4.4 Residential  
Recommendations for safe escape from residential accommoda-  
tion may be found in Approved Document B Volume 1, BS 9991  
\(houses, flats and maisonettes\) and BS 9999 together with spe-  
cialist codes for residential care premises in the *Health Technical*  
*Memoranda* issued by the Department for Health.  
Guidance in relation to houses, flats and maisonettes is high-  
lighted in what follows \(Approved Document B and BS 9991\).  
All residential accommodation requires automatic fire and  
smoke detection in accordance with the relevant sections of BS  
5839 Part 1 and BS 5839 Part 6 \(for the common areas\). Detection  
will afford early warning to residents and staff, instigating escape  
in the early stages of a fire when escape routes are relatively free  
of smoke.  
*4.4.1 Single- and two-storey houses*  
• Escape may be via the entrance hall or through suitable escape  
windows from each room.  
• No habitable room should be an inner room \(i.e. a room from  
which escape is possible only through another room which may  
contain the fire\), see Approved Document B Volume 1, para-  
graph 2.11.  
• An escape window should have an unobstructed openable area  
of 0.33 m2 at least 450 mm high and 450 mm wide. The bottom  
of the openable area should be no more than 1100 mm above the  
floor. The window should enable escape to a place free from fire.  
The window should remain in the open position without needing  
to be held open by an escaping person.  
Figures 11.13–11.14 show means of escape from the ground and  
upper levels of a house. Escape from levels a maximum of 4.5 m  
above ground level and inner rooms at ground level can utilise  
escape windows rather than protected escape routes in the circum-  
stances shown in Figure 11.13. **11-18 Fire safety**  
**11.13** *Means of escape from dwelling houses. Source\: from Approved Document B 2019 Volume 1 Diagram 2.1*  
*4.4.2 Flats and maisonettes*  
There are some differences between the recommendations of  
Approved Document B and BS 9991 for flats and maisonettes.  
Designers should refer to the full, adopted guidance as it is impos-  
sible to replicate all recommendations and restrictions for the  
various common layouts. The principles within the codes may be  
applied successfully to innovative layouts when supported by spe-  
cialist advice.  
The concept for escape from flats and maisonettes differs from  
that of other uses. It is a stay in place \(also known as defend in  
place\) strategy – initially only the apartment of fire origin evacuates  
and all others stay in place while it is safe to do so. This is based  
on the high standard of compartmentation and separation recom-  
mended in both Approved Document B, B3 *Internal fire spread*  
*\(structure\)* and BS 9991. From within each apartment, the residents  
should be able to escape unaided.  
The use of a stay in place policy has been questioned since the  
Grenfell Tower fire. The 2019 revision of Approved Document B  
retained the concept based on adequate compartmentation.  
BS 8629\:2019 *Code of practice for the design, installation,*  
*commissioning and maintenance of evacuation and alert systems*  
*for sue by fire and rescue services in buildings containing flats*, **Fire safety 11-19**  
**11.14** *Alternative cavity barrier arrangement in roof space over protected stairway in a house with a storey more than 4.5 m above*  
*ground level. Source\: from Approved Document B 2019 Volume 1 Diagram 2.3*  
makes recommendations for an evacuation and alert system that  
allows a FRS to manually activate alert sounders within each flat  
should they consider an ongoing situation warrants the evacuation  
of further flats and that it is safe to do so. The Code does not rec-  
ommend whether or not to install such an alert system. The Code  
is not referenced in Approved Document B. The Scottish Building  
Standards technical handbook 2019\: domestic, Clause 2.14.8,  
makes recommendations similar to BS 8629\:2019, in relation to  
domestic buildings more than 18.0 m above ground level.  
Figures 11.15–11.17 show means of escape from a variety of  
flats and maisonette settings from Approved Document B Volume  
1\. BS 9991 provides further recommendations in Figures 11.1,  
11.5–11.15 \(this is under review – see BSOL Standards Online for  
the latest version\).  
*4.4.3 Residential containment of fire by compartmentation*  
Each residential unit is a separate fire compartment. This  
should have a minimum of 60 minutes fire resistance but where  
**11.15** *Alternative arrangements for final exits. Source\: from Approved Document B Volume 1 2019, Diagram 2.2*

**11.17** *Ground or basement storey exit into an enclosed space. Source\: from Approved Document B Volume 1 2019, Diagram 2.5*  
compartmentation is coincidental with structural fire resistance,  
a higher standard may be required. The fire should be contained  
within the compartment and it is considered only necessary ini-  
tially to evacuate the unit \(compartment\) on fire. Consequently,  
the necessary width of escape exits and routes may be min-  
imalised. The travel distance, any alternative means of escape  
and the apartment layout dictate the level of internal protection  
necessary, which in turn influences the protection to common  
areas, see Approved Document B Volume 1 Section 3 – Means  
of escape flats.  
The common and ancillary areas in each block are separated  
from the accommodation by 60-minute compartment walls and  
floors. The common areas are provided with a form of smoke  
control to deter smoke from entering the stair and to dissipate  
smoke that enters the common escape route while the occupants  
of the fire apartment escape. Generally, an integral part of the  
smoke control is the automatically openable vent at the top of  
the stair that allows inlet air to support the smoke control within  
the common lobby/corridor and vents any smoke within the stair  
during the escape or firefighting phases. The flow of smoke into  
the corridor/lobby will stop or be minimised when the apart-  
ment entrance door \(self-closing\) closes after the occupants have  
escaped the fire apartment.  
The common stair should not connect with a basement car park  
and only connect with a covered car park at ground level and above  
if the car park has natural smoke vents or is mechanically venti-  
lated and is separated by a protected ventilated lobby. The stair  
should not serve ancillary accommodation unless it is separated by  
a protected lobby or corridor provided with a 0.4 m2 smoke vent or  
mechanical smoke extract.  
The stair should have either\:  
• A high level openable vent at each floor level within the stair  
\(1.0 m2 minimum free area\) or  
• A single openable vent \(1.0 m2 minimum free area\) that can be  
remotely operated from the Fire Service access level, should be  
provided at the head of the stair or  
• An automatic opening vent \(1.0 m2 minimum free area\) should  
be provided at the head of the stair.  
Detailed guidance on smoke control to common areas in apartments  
can be found in the Smoke Control Association *Guidance on smoke*  
*control to common escape routes in apartment buildings \(flats and*  
*maisonettes\)* Revision 3.1\: July 13, 2020, available to download  
from the Smoke Control Association website at www.feta.co.uk/  
associations/hevac/specialist-groups/smoke-control-association.  
# 4.5 Non-residential uses  
Guidance can be found in both Approved Document B Volume 2  
and BS 9999.  
Generally, BS 9999 addresses all such uses other than hospitals,  
schools and certain licensed premises but is a good source of gen-  
eral information.  
For hospitals – refer to the Technical Health Memoranda issued  
by the Department for Health.  
For schools – refer to Building Bulletin 100 \(BB100 Revised\)  
issued by the Department for Education.  
*4.5.1 Number of exits and escape routes*  
In order to determine the number of exits from a room or storey,  
their occupancy must be established. This may be known, or it can  
be assessed by the use of recognised space factors for specific uses.  
These are only indicators and can be varied. These numbers will also  
affect the width of escape routes. In existing buildings, the width of  
doors, stairways, passages, etc., if not to be altered, will dictate the  
numbers of people that can be accommodated, see Table XIV.  
*4.5.2 Occupancy*  
Once the occupancy factor for an area is known, the number of  
exits must equate to the necessary total width of escape required,  
although a minimum number of exits is specified within Approved  
Document B and BS 9999. Not less than two exits should be pro-  
vided, except in the case of an occupancy of less than 60, or a  
limited travel distance \(‘dead-end’\).  
*4.5.3 Capacities*  
The capacities of exits are given in tables within both Approved  
Document B Volume 2 and BS 9999. While not all exits need be of  
equal width, they should be evenly distributed to provide alterna-  
tives. Where there are two or more exits, it is assumed that fire may  
affect one of them, therefore the largest exit should be discounted.  
Hence the total number of exits = calculated number + 1.  
*4.5.4 Travel distances*  
The number of exits may result from compliance with the recom-  
mended travel distances, that is, the actual distance to be travelled to  
the nearest exit, having regard to obstructions such as partitions. The  
distances are not sacrosanct, but should be shorter rather than longer.  
Extension of travel distances may be justified where compensatory  
factors such as smoke control systems or early warning of fire are pro-  
vided. Only one exit need be within the travel distance; alternatives  
may be at any distance. BS 9999 allows extension of travel distances  
subject to certain conditions – see Section 3.8 in this chapter. **Fire safety 11-21**

Notes\:  
1 As an alternative to using the values in the table, the floor space factor may be determined by reference to actual data taken from similar premises. Where appropriate, the data  
should reflect the average occupant density at a peak trading time of year.  
2 Where accommodation is not directly covered by the descriptions given, a reasonable value based on a similar use may be selected.  
3 Where any part of the building is to be used for more than one type of accommodation, the most onerous factor\(s\) should be applied. Where the building contains different  
types of accommodation, the occupancy of each different area should be calculated using the relevant space factor.  
4 For detailed guidance on appropriate floor space factors for concourses in sports grounds refer to ‘Concourses’ published by the Football Licensing Authority.  
5 Alternatively, the occupant capacity may be taken as the number of fixed seats provided, if the occupants will normally be seated.

number of persons descending a stair plus a ground-storey popu-  
lation plus those ascending from a basement. The adequacy of the  
final exit of this merging flow should be assessed, as described in  
what follows\:  
*4.5.5 Alternative means of escape*  
A person should be able in most circumstances to turn their back  
on a fire and walk to an alternative exit. If escape is in one direction  
only, an exit or alternative escape route should be near enough for  
people to reach it before being affected by heat and smoke.  
For escape routes or exits to be ‘alternative’ they must be  
separated from each other by direction, space or fire-resisting con-  
struction. If one exit is affected by fire, the other\(s\) should not. See  
Figure 11.18.  
The Scottish Building Standards recommend that the angle of  
divergence should be not less than 45° plus 2 1/2° for every metre  
travelled in one direction.  
*4.5.7 Measuring width*  
There are several important widths\:  
• Door opening – the clear width, see Figure 11.19  
• Stair width – the clear width between the walls or balustrades or  
wall and balustrade. Handrails and strings that project into this  
width by no more than 100 mm may be ignored  
• Escape route width – the width at 1500 mm above floor level  
between any fixed obstructions. Handrails and strings that pro-  
ject into this width by no more than 100 mm may be ignored.  
*4.5.6 Width of escape routes and exits*  
An escape route should be as wide or wider than an exit leading to  
it, and should be of uniform width. The width of a final exit should  
equate to the route or routes it serves. This may comprise the total  
The safe and rapid use of a stair is dependent on all persons  
being within reach of a handrail, therefore no staircase should  
exceed 1.4 m in width unless additional central handrails are  
provided.

*4.5.8 Merging flows at a ground floor final exit*  
A final exit from a ground floor to outside a building may need  
to accommodate people from the ground floor and a stair – the  
flows of people will merge into the final exit, which must be of  
adequate width to the flow from the storey exit and stair combined,  
Figure 11.20\. See Approved Document B 2019 Volume 2 para-  
graph 2.23.

*Document B 2019 Volume 2 Diagram 2.6*  
*4.5.9 Evacuation protocol*  
The capacity and therefore the width of a stair differ from that of a  
horizontal escape route as they are influenced by the rate of descent  
and the standing position on the stairs. The width necessary is also  
influenced by the type of evacuation – total or phased – the stair having  
to accommodate only the population of a phase in the latter instance.  
TOTAL EVACUATION  
On the raising of the alarm the total population moves to evacuate  
the whole of the building in a single phase.  
STAGED/PHASED EVACUATION  
On the discovery of a fire the alarm is given in the following manner.  
The fire floor and the floor above are given the signal to evacuate  
immediately; all other floors are given the alert signal to stand by to  
evacuate. If the fire is extinguished, no further evacuation is neces-  
sary; if not, the next two floors immediately above the initial phase  
are evacuated; and so progressively in separate phases of two floors  
up the building to the top. Evacuation then proceeds down the build-  
ing, starting with the floors nearest the fire, until it is complete or the  
fire extinguished. As the population of only two floors are evacuated  
at a time, the stair width dimensions can be decreased.  
ADDITIONAL MEASURES FOR PHASED EVACUATION  
As people remain in the building during the fire, phased evacuation  
can take place only if additional protective measures are incorporated\:  
• All floors constructed as compartment floors with openings  
through them protected to maintain compartmentation  
• All stairs protected by lobbies or corridors of fire-resisting con-  
struction, except on a top storey  
• All lifts approached through a protected lobby  
• A fire alarm system \(conforming to at least an L3 standard in  
accordance with BS 5839–1\) incorporating a personal address/  
communication system operated from a central control point  
from where a fire warden can be instructed from a control point  
at the Fire Rescue Service access level and orderly evacuation  
directed  
• An automatic sprinkler installation throughout a building with a  
floor exceeding 30 m above ground level.  
Phased evacuation is not generally accepted for any basements,  
assembly, hotel, recreational and similar buildings, and, to date,  
the majority of shops. However, in the case of mixed user and large  
complexes, total evacuation may not be necessary or prudent and  
enforcing authorities should be consulted at an early stage.  
Phased evacuation for buildings exceeding 30.0 m in height should  
be agreed with the Fire Rescue Service at the design stage as evacuation  
may impede fire fighters entering and operating within the building.  
*4.5.10 Stairs*  
Where two or more stairs are provided, it is reasonable to assume  
that one will not be available for use due to fire or smoke unless  
a sufficiently high degree of protection is afforded. If a stair is  
approached through a lobby, or protected by a pressure differential  
smoke control system, it can be assumed that it will be available.  
Where such protection is not provided, a stair should be dis-  
counted \(number of stairs required = calculated number plus 1\).  
Each stair should be discounted in turn, to ensure that the capacity  
of the remaining stairs in total is adequate, see Tables XV–XVII.  
As an alternative to using Table XVII, the capacity of stairs  
1100 mm or wider \(for simultaneous evacuation\) can be derived  
from the formula that follows as set out in Approved Document B,  
Volume 2, 3.18 along with worked examples.  
• P = 200 W + 50\(W − 0.3\)\(N − 1\), or  
•  
where\:  
P is the number of people that can be served; W is the width of  
the stair, in metres; and N is the number of storeys served.  
Note 1\: Stairs with a rise of more than 30 m should not be wider  
than 1400 mm unless provided with a central handrail \(see par-  
agraph 4.15\).  
Note 2\: Separate calculations should be made for stairs/flights  
serving basement storeys and those serving upper storeys.  
Note 3\: The population ‘P’ should be divided by the number of  
available stairs.  
Note 4\: The formula is particularly useful when determining the  
width of stairs serving a building \(or part of a building\) where  
the occupants are not distributed evenly – either within a storey  
or between storeys. Note 5\: In the formula, the first part \(200 w\) represents the number  
of persons estimated to have left the stair after 2.5 minutes of evac-  
uation. The second part \[50\(w − 0.3\)\(n − 1\)\] represents the number  
of persons estimated to be accommodated on the stair after this time.  
*4.5.11 Stair design*  
Stair design should accord with Approved Document K or BS  
5395, *Stairs, ladders and walkways*. Where phased evacuation is  
envisaged, the minimum widths in Table XVIII may be adopted.  
For small premises see Approved Document B Volume 2  
Section 4. Small buildings occupied by a limited number of persons  
and satisfying the criteria for use, travel distance and a single exit  
can have a single stairway, see Figures 11.21–11.23.

Notes\:  
1 If the internal layout of partitions, fittings, etc. is not known, direct distances rather  
than travel distances, should be assessed. The direct distance should be assumed to  
be two-thirds of the actual travel distance.  
2 Maximum part of travel distance within the room. This limit applies within the  
bedroom and any associated dressing room, bathroom or sitting room, etc. The  
distance is measured to the door to the protected corridor that serves the room or  
suite. Sub-item \(b\) applies from that point along the bedroom corridor to a storey exit.  
3 In industrial and storage buildings, the appropriate travel distance depends on the  
level of fire hazard associated with the processes and materials being used.  
Higher hazard includes manufacturing, processing or storage of significant amounts  
of hazardous goods or materials, including any compressed, liquefied or dissolved  
gas, any substance which becomes dangerous by interaction with either air or  
water, any liquid substance with a flash point below 65°C including whisky or other  
spirituous liquor, any corrosive substance, any oxidising agent, any substance liable  
to spontaneous combustion, any substance that changes or decomposes readily giving  
out heat when doing so, any combustible solid substance with a flash point less than  
120°C, any substance likely to spread fire by flowing from one part of a building to  
another.  
Maximum travel distances within shopping malls are given in BS 5588\: Part 10.  
Guidance on associated smoke control measures is given in a BRE report *Design*  
*methodologies for smoke and heat exhaust ventilation* \(BR 368\).

Document B.

*4.5.12 Varying population*  
The recommended widths assume a uniform distribution of pop-  
ulation. If any floor within a building has a higher population, for  
example, a conference room or restaurant, any extra or wider stairs  
necessary to accommodate the increased population should extend  
down to final exit level.  
*4.5.13 Independent escape for different/mixed uses*  
Separate stairs should be provided for use by residential or assem-  
bly occupancies independent of any other use. Where a totally  
independent escape can be provided from these higher risk uses,  
for example, using an access deck or walkway, it is reasonable that  
some stairs may be shared.  
*4.5.14 External stairs*  
The use of external stairs should be avoided if possible, due to  
the psychological effect of using unfamiliar external stairs at  
high levels and the effects of bad weather. The width and design  
of external stairs is the same as for internal ones. External stairs  
are not considered suitable for use by the general public in an  
assembly or recreational use, nor for hospital, institutional or  
similar uses except for office or residential staff accommodation.  
They should only be used where there is at least one internal  
escape stair.  
Where used, external stairs should be protected in accordance  
with Figure 11.24. **11-26 Fire safety**

*4.5.15 Escape routes – protection* LOBBIES OR CORRIDORS TO PROTECT ESCAPE ROUTES  
Recommendations related to means of escape are generally based Additionally, lobbies or corridors of fire-resisting construction  
on a 30-minute period of fire resistance. Higher periods may result should be provided to give additional protection to stairs in the fol-  
by reason of the need to maintain compartmentation or provide lowing positions\:  
firefighting shafts.  
Escape stairs, other than external, should be enclosed by fire-re- • Between a floor area and stair in all buildings over 18 m in height  
sisting construction to protect against the effects of smoke, heat and at all levels  
fire, and to retard the progress of fire and smoke affecting escape • Between a stair and a basement storey as the stair is at greater  
routes. Escape routes should lead to final exits. risk from heat and smoke  
All escape routes should have clear headroom throughout of • Between a stair and an enclosed car park  
2.0 m, except for door openings. • Between a stair and a higher risk area, for example, a boiler room • In assembly buildings to protect the public and performers –  
where an opening occurs in a proscenium wall, and between  
stage and dressing room corridors  
• Where phased evacuation is used  
• Where a stair is not discounted.  
ENCLOSURE OF ESCAPE ROUTES  
Escape routes do not necessarily have to be enclosed. In some  
situations, this would create great problems – open-plan offices,  
exhibition halls, warehouses and factories.  
Where a corridor is not fire protected but is enclosed by parti-  
tions, such partitions should extend to a structural floor above or  
a suspended ceiling and doors should be provided in the corridor  
# Fire safety 11-27  
openings. This is to deter smoke from spreading during the early  
stages of a fire when escape is taking place.  
DEAD-END CORRIDORS  
Where a corridor dead-end situation exists, the escape route must  
be protected against fire, heat and smoke by fire-resisting construc-  
tion, as it may be necessary to pass the room on fire to reach the  
exit. See Figure 11.25.  
CORRIDORS  
Where a corridor connects escape routes, it should be protected  
against the ingress of smoke. To be effective, the construction  
should be from structural floor to structural floor or an imperforate  
**11\. 25** *Dead-end corridors. Source\: from Approved Document B 2019 Volume 2, Diagram 2.10*  
suspended ceiling. The corridors should also be subdivided by  
cross-corridor doors to inhibit the progress of smoke. These doors  
do not necessarily require fire resistance. Their purpose is to make  
it possible to take an alternative means of escape, not to subdivide  
the corridor at given intervals. Corridors exceeding 12 m should  
be subdivided \(not subdivided at 12 m intervals\) See Approved  
Document B Volume 2 paragraph 2.5 and Diagram 2.9.  
# 4.6 Lighting of escape routes  
General \(primary\) artificial lighting should be provided for persons  
to move about a building effectively and safely.  
Emergency \(escape\) lighting should be provided in those areas  
necessary for escape purposes in case the artificial lighting fails. It may  
be a maintained system \(continuously illuminated in conjunction with  
the general lighting\) or be non-maintained, only coming into operation  
on the failure of the general lighting. Maintained systems are usually  
provided in areas with large numbers of the public unfamiliar with  
their surroundings, and where darkened situations may be common.  
Escape lighting designed and installed in accordance with BS  
5266–1 should be as per Table XIX.

# 4.7 Signs  
*The Health and Safety \(Safety Signs and Signals\) Regulations 1996*  
sets out the requirements for safety signs at a place of work; this  
includes fire safety signs. Guidance on such requirements can be  
found in the Health and Safety Executive Document *Safety signs*  
*and signals. The Health and Safety \(Safety Signs and Signals\)*  
*Guidance on Regulations* at the HSE website.  
Signs are required to indicate the way to exits, and the exits them-  
selves, fire doors \(other than to and within flats/maisonettes\), fire  
alarm call points, portable firefighting equipment and the floor level  
and residential unit number required to assist firefighters. Preferred  
colours, sizes, typeface and graphics are set out in BS 5499. The  
criterion is that signs should be distinguishable against their back-  
ground and surroundings and be of a size that can be read at the  
required distance. If the use of the building warrants it, the signs may  
have to be in more than one language. In public assembly areas, signs  
are usually internally illuminated; elsewhere it is normally sufficient  
for escape lights to be positioned so as to illuminate a sign.  
# 4.8 Fastenings  
Fastenings on exit doors should allow exit without the use of a key  
or other device. Unless careful consideration is given to fastenings,  
security may be undermined. The degree of security required will  
depend on the use of the building and user requirements. Access  
into a building is not required for escape purposes\: re-entry into a  
floor area is neither necessary nor desirable. Fastenings that prevent  
a person entering a floor area from a staircase are acceptable. This is  
often a necessity to prevent theft in offices, factories and hotels and  
the like. The use of electronic fastenings and the use of card systems  
or similar to gain entry are acceptable provided that on the raising of  
the fire alarm or failure of the electrical system all locks ‘fail-safe’ in  
the unlocked position. An override facility to open a secured door is  
also normally required. Guidance can be found in BS 7273–4 *Code*  
*of practice for the operation of fire protection measures – part 4*  
*Actuation of release mechanisms for doors*. However, consideration  
should also be given to the possibility of criminals setting off a false  
fire alarm in order to circumvent security arrangements.  
Consideration should be given to the ability of the Fire Service  
to quickly access a building with residential accommodation that  
has no full time management presence to facilitate access into the  
building. Delay in gaining access for rescue purposes will be life  
threatening.  
Panic bolts and latches are most suitable where there are large  
numbers of persons. Turnbuckle locks with lever handles are com-  
monly used where no public is involved. These may not be suitable  
in some institutional buildings, or places used predominantly by  
the elderly or disabled who may find a small turnbuckle difficult  
to operate. Appropriate door ironmongery should be fitted in these  
circumstances.  
Guidance onhardware for fire and escape doors is published  
by the Door and Hardware Federation and Guild of Architectural  
Ironmongers at www.firecode.org.uk.  
# 4.9 Smoke control  
If a smoke control system is for life safety purposes, it is essential  
that its initiation is automatic on the detection of smoke; and if  
mechanical, that it remains operational at all times by the use of  
duplicate equipment and secondary power supplies etc. Specialist  
advice should be sought regarding the type, design and installation  
of a life safety system.  
Guidance on smoke control measures can be found in BS  
9999\:2017.  
The measures required to protect a means of escape from the  
effects of smoke will depend on the escape protocol adopted.  
Where escape is over a reasonable travel distance, the enclosure  
of the routes by partitions constructed to resist smoke, that is, to  
maintain their integrity, should be adequate. Some smoke will enter  
escape routes, but should not reach a level to make their use unten-  
able in the time it takes to reach an exit.  
As described earlier, the addition of lobbies will retard the  
entry of smoke. Ventilating the lobbies will further dilute the  
smoke and hopefully direct it away from the escape route. It is  
also possible to protect escape routes from the ingress of smoke  
by the use of pressure differentials to retard the movement of  
smoke whereby fans, ducts and vents are used to create different  
pressures between the fire and protected area. Specialist advice  
should be sought.  
# 4.10 Mechanical environmental ventilation  
These systems should not adversely affect a means of escape by perfo-  
ration of enclosures \(fire resistant or not\) without adequate protection,  
or by directing smoke into escape routes. Systems should have regard  
to BS 9999\:2017 \(Clauses 15.9 and 32.5\); Approved Document B  
Volume 1 Dwellings \(paragraph 9.6\) and Approved Document B  
Volume 2 Buildings other than dwellings \(paragraph 10.6\).  
# 4.11 Ancillary accommodation  
Ancillary accommodation \(see Table XVIII\) can present a risk  
to escape routes and evacuation and should be enclosed by a  
minimum of 30-minute fire-resisting construction. Such accommo-  
dation includes\:  
• Chemical stores  
• Cleaners stores  
• Bulk clothes storage  
• Day rooms in residential care premises \(including sheltered  
housing\)  
• Smoking rooms  
• Refuse stores  
• Plant rooms  
• Linen stores  
• Laundry rooms  
• Commercial kitchens  
• Kitchens in non-residential accommodation \(not necessarily tea  
making areas\)  
• Staff changing and locker rooms  
• Store rooms.  
# 4.12 Escape for people who find stairs a barrier or with  
# impairments that will affect their unaided escape  
Part M of the Building Regulations requires access to and use of  
a building and its facilities regardless of people’s age, gender or  
disability. Approved Document M makes recommendations in sup-  
port of Part M only – it does not provided guidance on means of **Fire safety 11-29**  
escape. While some references to escape can be found in BS 8300 *Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of dis- abled people. Code of practice*, the main sources of guidance are Approved Document B and BS 9999. Buildings designed specifically for use by persons with disabili- ties will require additional facilities and protection to escape routes Fire stopping is defined in Approved Document B Appendix  
A as ‘*A seal provided to close an imperfection of fit or design tol-*  
*erance between elements or components, to restrict the spread of*  
*fire and smoke’*. The Approved Document indicates fire stopping is  
required to the junction between a compartment floor and an exter-  
nal wall. For clarity, the following definitions are also useful\:  
depending on the disability. In any case, controlled escape by  
effective management is vital and assistance should be available. The aim of guidance in both Approved Document B and BS 9999 is that persons should be able to escape unaided. However, it is recognised that some people may not be able to negotiate stairs within a reasonable period of time or may not be able to see desig- nated escape routes or hear fire alarms. • Fire stopping – the sealing of imperfections of fit or where open-  
ings are formed to allow the passage of services  
• Fire barrier – a seal to maintain a line of compartmentation, or  
the protection of an opening in a line of fire resistance \(that may  
also be a compartment line\)  
• Cavity barrier – the sub-division of an unseen cavity.  
Fire alarms can be in the form of audible, visual or sensory sig-  
nals to overcome a number of impediments. Those with mobility impairments require refuges in which they **5.2 Fire stopping**

# 5.3 Fire barriers/protection of openings  
• The protection of an opening in a fire separating element  
• Fire doors and fire dampers to protect designed openings  
• A fire barrier /seal.  
Fire doors and shutters/curtains can be used to protect openings  
in lines of fire resistance/compartmentation. Generally shutters/  
curtains operated automatically be smoke detection should not be  
used across escape routes. See Approved Document B Volume 2  
Appendix C *fire door sets*.  
Ventilation ducts can be protected by\:  
• Fire dampers  
• Fire-resisting enclosures  
• The use of fire-resisting ductwork.  
Fire dampers should not be used within kitchen extract systems as  
grease and dirt will readily accumulate and present a fire risk. For  
further advice, see Section 10 of Approved Document B Volume 2  
and Clause 32.5 of BS 9999.  
Fire barriers/seals used to maintain lines of compartmentation  
should have the same fire resistance as the compartment line.  
# 5.4 Cavity barriers  
Cavity barriers are necessary to subdivide cavities/spaces and their  
edges that would form an unseen path for the spread of fire and  
smoke, Figure 11.27.  
Compartment walls should extend between floors. It is not  
acceptable to use a cavity barrier to complete a line of compart-  
mentation, for example, within a roof or false ceiling.

Lines of fire-resisting construction protecting escape routes  
should be extended between floors wherever possible but otherwise  
provided with cavity barriers on the line of the protected route or  
the partitions should extend to a fire-resisting ceiling, Figure 11.28.  
The extent of undivided cavities is set out in Approved

as the ‘responsible’ person under the Regulatory Reform \(Fire

This is generally the person who has control of the building, or  
otherwise the owner. The intent is that the responsible person has  
adequate information to manage the building and ensure the fire  
prevention measures are adequately maintained.  
This information will assist the person carrying out the required  
fire risk assessment in the occupied building, but should not be  
relied upon by the assessor without verification as to it being cor-  
rect and appropriate in the circumstances to which the building is  
put/used.  
Failure to supply the information is an offence. The building  
control body will require notification/evidence that the information

# 6 FIRE SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
# 6.1 Requirements  
Fire safety management includes fire prevention and the mainte-  
nance of fire safety facilities. The understanding and maintenance  
of all fire safety measures is essential, particularly in a large or  
complex building; therefore, the occupier/management should have  
a full understanding of the safety measures incorporated into the  
design of the building. This means that the designer must supply all  
relevant information in a fire safety manual. Details of the matters  
that should be included in the manual can be found in Section 19  
*Fire safety information* of Approved Document B Volume 2, which  
also addresses the requirement of Regulation 38 of the Building  
Regulations 2010 as amended. Extensive guidance on fire safety  
management and a fire manual is also given in BS 9999.  
# 6.2 Regulation 38  
Regulation 38 of the Building Regulations states\:  
• The person carrying out the work shall give fire safety infor-  
mation to the responsible person not later than the date of  
completion of the work, or the date of occupation . . . whichever  
is earlier.  
Regulation 38 requires the person carrying out the fire safety works  
to pass all relevant fire safety information to the person designated  
# 7 MATERIALS AND STRUCTURE  
# 7.1 General  
The materials forming a building should be chosen having regard  
to the safety of the structure and occupants. The adequacy of their  
resistance, or their ability to sustain load for any particular period  
when subjected to fire, may necessitate their protection to prevent  
the premature failure of the structure by collapse, or failure of load-  
bearing capacity. Additional resistance may be achieved by the use  
of protective coverings, casings or membranes.  
# 7.2 Form of construction  
Fire resistance relates to the form of construction rather than the  
material, and is stated in terms of performance in relation to British  
Standards methods of test or European classification of test results.  
These tests include/relate to\:  
• Loadbearing capacity \(resistance to collapse\)  
• Integrity \(resistance to fire penetration\)  
• Insulation \(resistance to transfer of excessive heat\).  
This is expressed as REI in the relevant European standards\:  
R – loadbearing capacity  
E – integrity  
I – insulation  
# 7.3 Loadbearing capacity/fire resistance  
For detailed information, refer to *Appendix B\: Performance of*  
*materials, products and* structures of Approved Document B  
Volumes 1 and 2. **11-32 Fire safety**  
It should be noted that the 2019 edition of Approved Document  
B uses the European classification for fire resistance as set out in BS  
EN 13501–2 to 4, adding that there may be some products lawfully  
on the market using the classification system set out in previous  
editions, In such situations, the equivalent classification given in  
Table B1 of Approved Document B Volumes 1 and 2 may be used.  
Consideration can be given to the use of products or systems  
having an Agrément Certificate issued by the British Board of  
Agrément or a product complying with a European Technical  
Approval \(refer to the EEC Construction Products Directive\).  
In considering the use of a system or component that has a cer-  
tificate attesting conformity, all aspects of the certificate should be  
taken into consideration and attention paid to any caveats relat-  
ing to its use in particular circumstances or other limitation taken  
into consideration. Such a caveat may render the system/compo-  
nent unacceptable in certain circumstances. The limitation may  
be embedded in the circumstances of the original test data, which  
should be obtained and scrutinised.  
# 7.4 CE marking  
The CE marking of components covered by European Technical  
standards was mandatory until December 31, 2020. Refer to *Using*  
*the UKCA mark from January 1, 2021*, which advises UK marking  
will apply to most goods subject to the CE marking. CE marking  
can be used until January 1, 2022 in most cases.  
# 7.5 Suitability  
Regard should be given to the suitability of materials adopted, the  
ease of acquiring the required fire protection, ease of construction  
and durability. Although the last is not required under the Building  
Regulations, a material should be ‘fit for the purpose’ – Building  
Regulation 7 as amended. There are several terms used in Approved  
Document B issued in support of the Building Regulations specifi-  
cally relevant to materials and their choice.  
# 7.6 Surface spread of flame  
Restriction of the spread of flame across the surface of a material  
is an important factor of fire safety, as it affects fire growth and  
spread, and means of escape. The term is used in the 2019 edi-  
tion of Approved Document B Volumes 1 and 2, particularly in  
relation to both means of escape B1, and external fire spread B4,  
by reference to fire performance as classified in BS EN 13501  
\(parts as appropriate\) adding that there may be some products  
lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in  
previous editions, and in such situations the equivalent classifi-  
cation given in Table B1 of Approved Document B Volumes 1  
and 2 may be used.  
It should be noted that neither *surface spread of flame* or *class*  
*0* are defined in Approved Document B 2019. See Approved  
Document B 2019 edition Appendix B National Classifications for  
reaction to fire paragraph B10 and Table B1 plus footnotes.  
Materials chosen for low spread of flame properties may later  
be compromised by inappropriate maintenance/decorative finishes.  
Guidance also recommends restrictions on the use of thermo-  
plastic materials used for glazing \(windows and internal\), rooflights  
and lighting diffusers, and suspended or stretched skin membranes.  
Reference should be made to Approved Document B 2019 edition,  
and/or BS 9999.  
# 7.7 Steel  
Exposed steel can lose strength very quickly when exposed to fire,  
buckling and collapsing in as little as 10 to 15 minutes. The actual  
temperature at which it starts to lose strength depends on the type  
of steel, whether it is in tension or compression, and its restraint  
if any. Encasing the steel insulates it against temperature rise.  
Protection can be in the form of concrete, fire-retardant boards,  
fibrous sprayed or intumescent coatings, or suspended ceilings.  
Water cooling has been used to protect columns.  
A useful reference is the ASFP Yellow Book\: Fire protection  
for structural steel in buildings, 5th Edition, \(Volume 1 of 2\),  
# 7.8 Aluminium  
Some forms fail structurally at quite low temperatures, but it has  
good properties for low flame spread.  
# 7.9 Concrete  
This loses its crushing strength in fire. The heat of the fire also  
affects the strength of steel reinforcement. Adequate concrete cover  
is essential and may require the addition of mesh reinforcement to  
restrict spalling; this is caused by the reinforcement expanding with  
heating.  
# 7.10 Clay masonry, brickwork  
As a form of ceramic, clay performs well at high temperatures  
albeit some expansion may take place. Any steel in clay can expand  
causing failure and should be protected.  
# 7.11 Timber  
This performs better than steel in a fire. It is a low conductor of  
heat; it progressively chars, protecting itself with a charcoal layer.  
The charring rate can be assessed and the ability of the residual tim-  
ber to sustain the required loads calculated. See BS EN 1995–1–1  
*Eurocode 5 and the UK National Annex to Eurocode 5 Design of*  
*timber structures Part 1–2 general – structural fire design*.  
Timber studwork with plasterboard can easily achieve 30 min-  
utes’ fire resistance; 60 minutes with additional protection. Existing  
timber floors can be upgraded to improve their fire resistance by the  
addition of soffit protection and insulation – see BRE Digest 208,  
*Increasing the fire resistance of existing timber floors*.  
# 7.12 Asbestos  
This is no longer used for health reasons. It may be found as fire  
protection in existing buildings.  
A useful reference is the Health and Safety Executive website  
\(hse.gov.uk\) for information relating to the retention or removal of  
asbestos, which may require a licence.  
# 7.13 Protective boards \(plasterboard, mineral fibre  
# boards, cementitious\)  
These are used to protect structural members and form fire-resist-  
ing enclosures on suitable frames. Some forms of construction and  
systems can achieve in excess of two hours’ fire resistance when  
constructed correctly. Construction systems used should be tested  
\(have been tested\) to indicate the required fire performance can  
be achieved. Boards should be used in accordance with the tested  
specification for the appropriate level of fire resistance.  
Service penetrations through boards should be installed in  
accordance with the fire tested specification.  
# 7.14 Glass  
Plain glass \(depending on whether it is toughened or laminated\)  
offers negligible fire resistance. Wired glass can achieve a 60 min-  
utes standard of fire resistance in terms of integrity but with little  
insulation, although this is not generally used as it is dangerous if  
broken – the exposed wires presenting an additional risk.  
Insulating fire-resisting glazing can achieve in excess of two  
hours; the size of glazing panels may be restricted.  
Fire-resisting glass, whether providing insulation or not, should  
be used only in accordance with tested assembly specifications.  
A useful reference is *A guide to best practice in the specification*  
*and use of fire – resistant glazed systems* published by the Glass  
and Glazing Federation.  
# 7.15 Plastics  
Thermosetting plastics harden when heated, and thermoplastics  
soften on heating. Plastics often fall from their supports, making an assessment of  
their action in fire difficult under test conditions. The material may  
not burn, but can drip flaming droplets and spread fire.  
See Approved Document B regarding the acceptable use of  
thermoplastic materials for ceilings, rooflights and lighting diffus-  
ers, and plastics used for insulation in external and internal walls.  
# 7.16 Doors and shutters  
These can be wooden, glass, metal or composite, see Table XXII.  
Some can achieve a fire resistance in excess of four hours.  
# Fire safety 11-33  
Doors and shutters are tested as an assembly and should be pur-  
chased and installed as such. Fire shutters/curtains are generally  
held open and close on the actuation of a fusible link, or automat-  
ically following detection of heat or smoke. Doors are designated  
according to their performance in minutes in terms of their integ-  
rity. Doors forming part of a protected enclosure \(stair, lobby or  
corridor\) for means of escape should have not less than a 30-minute  
standard of fire resistance. Additionally, these doors should be able  
to resist the passage of smoke at ambient temperatures; these are  
generally denoted by the suffix ‘S’, that is, FD30s.

Notes\:  
1 Classified in accordance with **BS EN 13501–2**. National classifications do not necessarily equate with European classifications, therefore products cannot typically assume a  
European class unless they have been tested accordingly.  
2 Unless pressurisation techniques that comply with **BS EN 12101–6** are used, these doors should also comply with one of the following conditions.  
a\) Have a leakage rate not exceeding 3 m3/m/hour \(from head and jambs only\) when tested at 25 Pa under **BS 476–31.1**.  
b\) Meet the additional Sa classification when tested to **BS EN 1634–3**.  
Source\: from Approved Document B Volume 2, Table C1 **11-34 Fire safety**  
Most door sets require the addition of an intumescent strip to  
attain a 30-minute standard of fire resistance. The seal intumesces  
at high temperature swelling to seal any imperfections of fit or  
gaps and thereby protecting the edges of the door to maintain  
its integrity. The ambient temperature seal, which may be in the  
form of a brush, retards the passage of smoke around the door  
when the fire is at a lower temperature but possibly producing  
large quantities of smoke. Various codes require ‘S’ doors in dif-  
ferent situations. To be effective for means of escape, doors must  
be self-closing. However, the internal doors of houses and apart-  
ments are not required to be self-closing – national experience  
indicated that the majority of closers are removed/not maintained.  
Occupants should be advised for their own safety to close all  
doors to rooms in a protected staircase or lobby/corridor at night  
before retiring to sleep.  
Where a door is in constant use, it may be acceptable to use  
a hold-open device \(usually electromagnetic\) to avoid it being  
wedged open or damaged.  
Fire doors should be tested from both sides. Recent testing of  
certified composite doors has shown failure from one or both sides  
of some doors. Some manufacturers had stipulated that only one  
side be subjected to the fire test. The full test certificate details  
should be obtained and reviewed.  
# 7.17 Materials for fire stopping and cavity barriers  
These must effectively close a cavity and stop spread of fire and  
smoke around a service or element, by sealing an imperfection  
of fit. The material must be capable of sustaining movement,  
including expansion, be adequately fixed and, in the case of  
barriers, have fire resistance. Materials include intumescent  
mastics, fire-protective boards, cement mortar, gypsum plaster  
and glass fibre.  
There are numerous proprietary fire stopping and cavity barrier  
systems. The fire test certificate will specify the structure in which  
the system was positioned and how it was supported etc. The sys-  
tem should only be used in accordance with/within the same tested  
situation.  
A useful reference is the Association for Specialist Fire  
Protection’s Red Book – Fire stopping\: linear joint seals, Penetration  
Seals and Cavity Barriers; Grey Book – Volume 1 Fire Dampers.  
# 7.18 Intumescent coatings  
These are formed of differing materials with varying characteristics  
and foam on exposure to heat to form a protective coating. They  
can be used to improve fire resistance and reduce surface spread of  
flame. If adopted the following points should be considered\:  
• The intumescent system must be compatible with the material  
to be protected  
• The system must suit site conditions by virtue of the necessary  
mode of application, and in accordance with that tested and  
achieving the required standard. This includes atmospheric con-  
ditions  
• Not all are suitable in areas of high humidity  
• Protection against mechanical damage may be necessary  
• Possible damage of the protection by secondary fixings, fol-  
low-on trades or water damage.  
# 8 FIRE PROTECTION INSTALLATIONS AND  
# APPLIANCES  
# 8.1 General  
Fire protection appliances and installations form part of an over-  
all fire protection system. Active extinguishing systems are often  
installed to compensate for inadequate structural protection, or to  
facilitate an innovative concept or design which would be ham-  
pered by protective construction or division by fire walls.  
# 8.2 Fire/smoke detection and alarms  
Fire alarm systems may be activated manually \(by the breaking of  
a call point unit\) or automatically by smoke and heat detection. The  
detection may be by point detectors \(heads\) or other systems such  
as linear heat detectors, flame and infrared detectors.  
The effectiveness of the installation is dependent on the  
correct selection of the system, its design and installation. The  
system may be required for property protection or life safety,  
or both. The system must be suitable for the evacuation proto-  
col \(simultaneous/staged/phased\) and address the needs of those  
with hearing and sight impediments. Specialist advice should  
be sought.  
*Types of detection*  
• *Smoke detectors* – detect the presence of smoke by optical  
\(obscuration\) or ionisation methods and raise an alarm. Ionisation  
detectors are sensitive in the early stages of a fire when smoke  
particles are small, and are most suitable in a controlled envi-  
ronment such as a computer suite. Optical detectors react to the  
visible products of combustion.  
• *Heat detectors* – detect heat at a pre-selected temperature or on  
a rapid rise in temperature. Use where smoke may be present  
as part of process or function, but regard should be had to the  
normal temperature of the area where sited.  
Heat detectors are generally not acceptable as the only auto-  
matic means of giving warning of fire where life safety is being  
considered.  
• *Combination detectors* – these can incorporate both ionisation  
and obscuration or smoke and heat detection.  
• *Laser beam detectors* – rising hot air affects laser beams being  
projected onto a receiver by obscuration or movement. Suitable  
for covering large open areas but note that the receiver may be  
subject to building movement. Beware of false alarms from fall-  
ing objects or birds and reflection from water \(such as swimming  
pools\).  
*Guidance*  
• Domestic fire alarms\: BS 5839–6 *Code of practice for the design,*  
*installation, commissioning and maintenance of fire detection*  
*and fire alarm systems in domestic premises*  
• Non-residential uses and the common areas of residential  
uses\: BS 5939–1 *Code of practice for the design, installation,*  
*commissioning and maintenance of systems in non-domestic*  
*premises*.  
A manual system \(gongs, handbells, etc.\) is only to be used in  
exceptional cases for very small buildings or specific areas. An  
automatic system in which a fire alarm can be initiated automat-  
ically by the breaking of a call point or by a detector is the more  
common form. The complexity of the evacuation may require a  
message relayed via a public address system, initial alarms and  
alert signals, or the provision of fire telephones. Modern sys-  
tems can be highly technical, incorporating computers and other  
data-processing equipment; specialist advice should be obtained  
at an early stage in any design.  
# 8.3 Suppression systems  
The following brief descriptions give an indication of some of the  
appliances and systems available and their application. The adop-  
tion of any particular system requires careful consideration – the  
appliance/system must be suitable for the area in which it is to be  
used. The nature of the risk, effectiveness of protection, reliabil-  
ity, ease of maintenance should be considered. Specialist advice  
should be sought. Reference should be made to the relevant British  
Standards – see Section 8, Bibliography. Although the use of a  
non-UK system or component is not prohibited, the prior agree-  
ment and approval of any enforcing authority, insurer or water  
undertaker should be obtained. **8.4 Automatic fire sprinklers**  
These provide an automatically released water spray above a fire  
to contain its growth and inhibit its spread. There are various types  
and systems for specific areas, applications and risk categories. It  
should be noted that some systems are meant for property protec-  
tion only, and that special/additional provisions relate to life safety.  
Certain situations may not be considered suitable for protection by  
sprinklers because of the potential water damage \(e.g. data centres,  
art galleries, museums, historical libraries\). This is due to the risk  
of accidental discharge or the unsuitability of water as the extin-  
guishing medium for certain uses \(e.g. electrical plant\), processes  
and materials. A large volume of stored water is required.  
Sprinklers are the most commonly used form of suppression in  
industrial, commercial and residential premises. Residential sprin-  
klers may not require water storage – an acceptable water main of  
adequate pressure can be used. But it is more likely that a pump\(s\)  
will be necessary.  
Water is sprayed onto a fire removing the heat by cooling.  
Only the sprinkler head\(s\) in the immediate vicinity of the fire are  
activated. The liquid within the small bulb of the sprinkler head  
expands when exposed to heat, breaks and releases the water.  
Damage is limited to the vicinity of the fire. The volume of dis-  
charged water can be significant.  
Current guidance recommends the installation of sprinklers in  
buildings of certain size, height and use. This varies within the  
United Kingdom. In England, all building with a floor at a height  
of 30 m above ground level irrespective of use should be provided  
with a sprinkler installation throughout. Blocks of flats with a top  
storey more than 11.0 m above ground level should be fitted with a  
sprinkler system within the individual flats \(and the common parts  
if these are not devoid of potential ignitions risks and combustible  
materials, i.e. they are not fire sterile\).  
Appendix E of Approved Document B sets out guidance regard-  
ing the design and water supplies and pumps for sprinkler systems.  
For residential sprinklers, refer to BS 9251\:2014 *Fire sprinkler*  
*systems for domestic and residential occupancies – Code of practice*.  
For other uses\: BS EN 12845\:2015 *Fixed firefighting systems –*  
*Automatic sprinkler systems – Design, installation and maintenance*.  
# 8.5 Water drenchers  
These produce a curtain of water, usually to protect the outside of a  
building or the safety curtain of a theatre.  
# 8.6 Water mist systems  
Water mist systems may be acceptable as an alternative to sprin-  
klers where relevant fire test evidence exists.  
Tiny water droplets are sprayed onto the fire resulting in a  
large total surface area that absorbs heat lowering the temperature,  
reducing radiated heat and displacing oxygen to a level where fire  
cannot be sustained. The flames are smothered by evaporation to  
steam. It is a very effective form of suppression, but smouldering  
fires may not generate the necessary steam to extinguish. Water  
mist has the benefit of limited wetting and is therefore easy/faster  
to clean up post fire. The required water storage is significantly less  
than for a sprinkler installation.  
Water mist systems are suitable for fires involving oils or  
similar flammable liquids. These are used within residential  
accommodation and may be the preferred option for archives and  
other collections, as less water damage is likely.  
*Guidance*  
• Residential water mist installations\: BS 8458 *Fixed fire protection*  
*systems – Residential and domestic water mist systems – Code of*  
*practice for design and installation*  
• Industrial and commercial water mist installations\: BS 8458–1  
*Fixed fire protection systems – Industrial and commercial*  
*waste mist systems – Part 1\: Code of practice for design and*  
*installation*.  
# Fire safety 11-35  
# 8.7 Foam installations  
These are of limited application, generally for the extinction  
of flammable liquid fires. They may require space for on-site  
foam-making equipment. There are various forms; specialist  
advice will be needed. A foam inlet is a fixed pipe through which  
foam can be pumped to protect rooms containing oil fuel, oil fired  
boilers, etc.  
The use of foam requires the agreement of the Fire Service as it  
may present operational issues for firefighting.  
# 8.8 Gaseous and vaporising liquid installations  
An inert gas or chemical is discharged into the room\: inert gas  
replaces the oxygen thereby preventing further combustion; a  
chemical discharge reduces the heat preventing further combustion.  
The gas penetrates all areas and generally does not damage the  
room contents. The room requires vents to allow the displacement  
of the air in the room. The partitions enclosing the room must be  
structurally resilient to withstand the pressures exerted by the sys-  
tem. Some gases require a mechanical extract system to remove  
them after the fire.  
The gas /chemical must be replaced after discharge.  
Such systems are satisfactory for electrical, computer and tele-  
phone equipment, flammable liquids, some chemicals, libraries,  
archives, art stores, diesel engines and textiles. Gas/chemical sup-  
pression is not suitable for public areas.  
Specialist advice should be sought.  
# 8.9 Oxygen depletion \(hypoxic systems\)  
In simple terms, nitrogen replaces oxygen within the enclosure.  
This results in an inert atmosphere, thus preventing/deterring com-  
bustion. The oxygen level is maintained to support life, but such a  
system may not be suitable in the absence of accredited informa-  
tion as to its long-term effects on persons in an occupied space.  
# 8.10 Fire mains within a building  
Rising mains serve floor levels at and above ground level; falling  
mains serve levels below ground.  
The mains deliver water for firefighting onto the floor of a build-  
ing via landing valves.  
A wet rising/falling main is a pipe permanently charged with  
water and is generally installed in buildings above 50 m in height,  
beyond the pumping capabilities of a Fire Service pumping appli-  
ance; it requires water storage and pumps.  
A dry riser/falling main is an empty pipe charged by a Fire  
Service pump at ground/access level. It can be provided in any  
building below 18.0 m in height, but is generally provided in  
a building over 18.0 m but less than 50.0 m high. The water is  
pumped up the building by a Fire Service pump appliance con-  
nected to a street or private hydrant. Any horizontal section should  
not exceed 12 m in length unless the delivery of the required rate of  
water at each outlet can be proven hydraulically.  
Hydrant installations should accord with the recommendations  
of BS 9990.  
Private hydrants are provided within the curtilage of a site  
where statutory hydrants are too distant or where the risk is such as  
to require large volumes of water immediately.  
# 8.11 Hand fire appliances\: extinguishers, fire buckets,  
# fire blankets  
These are first aid appliances for use by employees/management,  
but only by those who are trained in their use. The extinguishing  
medium of hand-held extinguishers varies to suit the risk.  
Dry powder extinguishers are generally avoided due to potential  
problems caused to breathing in the fine powder.  
# 8.12 Hose reels  
These are first aid appliances connected to a pressurised water sup-  
ply for use by trained occupants and firefighters. **11-36 Fire safety**  
Generally, hose reels are now only installed in prisons and hos-  
pitals where staff are specifically trained in their use. Hose reels are  
not easy to handle and inappropriate use can spread fire.  
Concern has been expressed that hose reels may contain  
legionella, but research has found no evidence.  
The removal of existing hose reel installations is usually accept-  
able to a fire authority, but prior agreement should be sought.  
# 9 STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  
# 9.1 Legislation  
The statutory requirements to provide fire precautions almost with-  
out exception relate to life safety, although in consequence a degree  
of property protection is achieved.  
*Building regulations – new building works, alterations,*  
*extensions and changes of use*  
The requirements for fire safety are addressed by Building  
Regulations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  
The requirements, although similar, vary in each country. As there  
are further regional variations, the regional building control body  
and/or fire authority should be consulted to ascertain the relevant  
legislation applicable and the current fire safety guidance available.  
*Buildings in use*  
The Regulatory Reform \(Fire Safety\) Order 2005 addresses fire  
safety in non-domestic premises in England and Wales and requires  
a risk assessment of a building in use to ascertain if the fire safety  
measures are appropriate and are being maintained. The Order does  
not currently apply to the dwellings in residential blocks; the Order  
applies to the common parts of the blocks and all service areas – in  
effect the areas where people work, for example, cleaners, mainte-  
nance engineers, caretakers\).  
The Fire Safety Bill \(2019–2020\) will amend the Order to\:  
• Allow changing or clarifying the premises to which it applies;  
and,  
• Verify that in a building containing two or more sets of domestic  
premises, the risk assessment required under the Order extends  
to the building structure, external walls \(including attachments  
thereto such as balconies\) and the common parts. These include  
the doors between the domestic premises and common parts  
such as the flat entrance doors and those that form part of the  
escape routes from domestic premises.  
See also, Section 10 Bibliography.  
# 9.2 Requirements  
*Building Regulations 2010, as amended*  
The requirements for fire safety under the Building Regulations for  
England are as follows\:  
*BI\: Means of escape*.  
The building shall be designed and constructed so that there  
are appropriate provisions for the early warning of fire, and  
appropriate means of escape in case of fire from the build-  
ing to a place of safety outside the building capable of being  
safely and effectively used at all material times.  
*B2\: Internal fire spread \(linings\)*  
\(1\) To inhibit the spread of fire within the building the inter-  
nal linings shall  
\(a\) \(b\) Resist the spread of flame over their surfaces; and  
Have, if ignited, a rate of heat release which is rea-  
sonable in the circumstances.  
\(2\) In this paragraph, ‘internal linings’ means the materials lin-  
ing any partition, wall, ceiling or other internal structure.  
*B3\: Internal fire spread \(structure\)*  
\(1\) The building shall be designed and constructed so that,  
in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a  
reasonable period.  
\(2\) A wall common to two or more buildings shall be  
designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the  
spread of fire between those buildings. For the purposes  
of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-de-  
tached house are each to be treated as a separate building.  
\(3\) Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire  
within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent  
appropriate to the size and intended use of the building,  
comprising either or both of the following\:  
\(a\) Sub-division of the building with fire-resisting con-  
struction  
\(b\) Installation of suitable automatic fire suppression  
systems.  
\(4\) The building shall be designed and constructed so that  
the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed  
spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.  
*B4\: External fire spread*  
\(1\) \(2\) The external walls of the building shall adequately resist  
the spread of fire over the walls and from one building to  
another, having regard to the height, use and position of  
the building.  
The roof of the building shall adequately resist the spread  
of fire over the roof and from one building to another,  
having regard to the use and position of the building.  
*Regulation 7 Materials and workmanship*  
\(1\) Building work shall be carried out –  
\(a\) with adequate and proper materials which –  
\(i\) are appropriate for the circumstances in which  
they are used,  
\(ii\) are adequately mixed or prepared, and  
\(iii\) are applied, used or fixed so as adequately  
to perform the functions for which they are  
designed; and  
\(b\) in a workmanlike manner.  
\(2\) \(3\) Subject to paragraph \(3\), building work shall be carried  
out so that materials which become part of an external  
wall, or specified attachment, of a relevant building are  
of European Classification A2-sl, d\) or A1, classified in  
accordance with BS EN 13501–1\:2007+A1\:2009 entitled  
“Fire classification of construction products and building  
elements. Classification using test data from reaction  
to fire tests” \(ISBN 978 0 580 59861 6\) published by  
the British Standards Institution on March 30, 2007 and  
amended in November 2009.  
Paragraph \(2\) does not apply to –  
\(a\) cavity trays when used between two leaves of  
masonry;  
\(b\) any part of a roof \(other than any part of a roof  
which falls within paragraph \(iv\) of regulation 2\(6\)\)  
if that part is connected to an external wall;  
\(c\) door frames and doors;  
\(d\) electrical installations;  
\(e\) insulation and water proofing materials used below  
ground level;  
\(f\) intumescent and fire stopping materials where the  
inclusion of the materials is necessary to meet the  
requirements of Part B of Schedule 1; \(g\) membranes;  
\(h\) \(i\) seals, gaskets, fixings, sealants and backer rods;  
thermal break materials where the inclusion of the  
materials is necessary to meet the thermal bridging  
requirements of Part L of Schedule 1; or  
\(j\) window frames and glass.  
\(4\) In this regulation –  
\(a\) a ‘relevant buildings’ means a building with a storey  
\(not including rooftop plant areas or any storey con-  
sisting exclusively of plant rooms\) at least 18 metres  
above ground level and which –  
\(i\) contains one or more dwelling  
\(ii\) contains an institution; or  
\(iii\) contains a room for residential purposes  
\(excluding any room in a hostel, hotel or  
boarding house\); and  
\(b\) ‘above ground level’ in relation to a storey means  
above ground level when measured from the lowest  
ground level adjoining the outside of a building to  
the top of the floor surface of the storey.  
*B5\: Access and facilities for the Fire Service*  
\(1\) \(2\) The building shall be designed and constructed so as to  
provide reasonable facilities to assist firefighters in the  
protection of life.  
Reasonable provision shall be made within the site of the  
building to enable fire appliances to gain access to the  
building.  
The Building Regulations relate to a building under construction,  
certain changes of use and certain extensions and alterations.  
Requirements B2; B3\(1\), \(2\) and \(4\); B4 and B5 apply to all  
buildings; certain prisons are exempt from the other requirements.  
*Regulatory Reform \(Fire Safety\) Order 2005*  
The Regulatory Reform \(Fire Safety\) Order 2005 came into force  
on October 1, 2006. The Order applies to any place \(other than a  
private dwelling\) where a person works.  
With few exceptions \(e.g. off-shore installations, quarries,  
mines and borehole sites\), the Order applies to all non-domestic  
premises including the common areas and, for example, areas only  
frequented by maintenance staff/contractors, caretakers and clean-  
ers, in residential blocks; and both the common and shared parts of  
houses in multiple occupation \(HMOs\). It covers the safety of any  
person lawfully on the premises and in its immediate vicinity if at  
risk from a fire on the premises.  
The Order applies to occupied premises. It requires that the ‘respon-  
sible person’as defined in the Order \(usually the person having control  
over the premises or the owner\) carries out \(or arranges for\) a fire risk  
assessment of the premises in use. The assessment is to ascertain if the  
passive and active fire safety measures, including the management and  
evacuation protocols etc are appropriate to the building having regard  
to the way it is used, and that the measures are adequately maintained.  
Further risk assessments are required if the building structure or  
layout is altered, the fire safety measures are altered, the management  
structure changes, or the use or circumstances under which the build-  
ing \(or a part\) is used changes. While there is currently no period  
specified for the re-assessment of buildings that have not been altered,  
the annual re-assessment of residential buildings is not uncommon,  
particularly for sheltered housing or institutional buildings.  
The duties of the ‘responsible person’ under the Order and  
the fire risk assessment required are explained in various doc-  
uments and circulars issued by the Government. The various  
types of building use, for example, offices and shops and trans-  
port premises and facilities are addressed in individual guidance  
documents.

Floods are typically caused by\:  
• Extreme weather events such as rainstorms, hurricanes or tsuna-  
mis, or variation such as rapid snow melt  
• Human-made activities such as structural failure of human-made  
facilities such as dams or embankment.  
Flood risk is commonly considered a combination of probability  
\(likelihood of exposure to flooding\) and consequence \(the vulner-  
ability of the receptor to being flooded\). This is the likelihood of  
a flood occurring in any given year and the impact of that flood.  
Reducing flood risk requires consideration of both factors.  
For instance, it is possible to reduce the probability of flooding  
by installing defences, but increase the consequence of a flood by  
building more homes behind the defences. However, if the homes  
are designed to be flood resilient then the consequence of them  
flooding is low and the overall risk reduced. Equally, it is possible  
to increase the probability of flooding by removing defences but  
reduce the consequence by relocating occupants and changing to  
natural wetlands.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
Flooding is a natural part of the weather cycle. Many people live  
in areas of high flood risk such as river systems, deltas and coasts,  
drawn by fertile land and waterway transport links. But throughout  
the world, flooding has had a devastating impact, at times destroy-  
ing whole cities and communities.  
As global warming influences the natural water cycle, a par-  
adigm shift in our approach to the design of new and existing  
settlements is required. Coastal communities are increasingly  
threatened by rising sea levels and stormier weather, whilst inland  
towns and homes suffer from more intense rainstorms with worse  
and more frequent flooding.  
As a result, the number of people at risk of flooding is rising,  
particularly in urban areas, where population rises, increased hard  
surfaces and changing weather patterns exacerbate the problem.  
According to the Environment Agency, over 5.5 million, or one in  
six, properties are at risk of flooding from all types of floods across  
England and Wales.  
However, by better understanding the nature of flood risk, cities  
and buildings can be better designed to manage and reduce the risk  
to people and property.  
# 2 UNDERSTANDING FLOODING  
# 2.1 Flood risk  
Natural disasters appear to be occurring with both greater fre-  
quency and intensity around the globe. In part, this is a result of  
more people living in high-risk areas, particularly through urbani-  
sation and unplanned development.  
# 2.2 Probability  
The probability of flooding is described as the annual percentage prob-  
ability of a flood occurring, such as 5 per cent. This is also described  
as 1 in 20 years, but this can be misleading as a 5 per cent probability  
flood could occur 3 years in a row and then not again for 60 years.  
The probability of a flood also reflects the magnitude. A 1 per  
cent \(1 in 100 year\) flood will be bigger than a 5 per cent \(1 in  
20 year\) flood; that is why it is less likely to occur. However, cli-  
mate change is affecting the magnitude of floods and confusing  
this method of understanding. In the future, a 5 per cent probability  
flood could be more extensive, perhaps equivalent to a current 2  
per cent flood.  
# 2.3 Consequence  
The consequences of flooding are usually measured in terms of  
the impact of flooding on the people or things that were flooded,  
the receptors. It is typically measured in terms of loss of life and  
financial costs, from both direct and indirect causes. The main  
consideration for the built environment is the vulnerability of the  
receptors. A hospital is likely to be considered to be more vulner-  
able than an office or workshop, due to the nature of its occupants  
and equally its role in society.  
# 2.4 Sources of flooding  
Flooding can occur from various sources, as outlined in guid-  
ance such as Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy  
Framework\:  
• **River \(fluvial\)** flooding when excess water bursts the riverbanks,  
Figure 12.1. This occurs when the run off following a large rain-  
storm overwhelms the capacity of the river or artificial channel.  
The land around the river that is flooded is known as the flood  
plain and can extend for hundreds of metres, sometimes miles.  
This is the most common and well-known type of flooding.

**12.1** *River flooding*  
*Source*\: Marlow 2014  
• **Coastal flooding** when seawater is driven on to the land by  
storms, tsunamis and high tides. This occurs when seismic activ-  
ity causes tidal waves or when meteorological events, such as  
hurricanes or storms, combine with strong winds and low pres-  
sure to cause sea levels to rise above expected peak levels. If  
these storm surges overwhelm or breach the sea defences they  
can have devastating consequences, particularly for communi-  
ties in low-lying areas.  
• **Pluvial, overland and sewer flooding** when drains are over-  
whelmed leading to rain ponding and flowing over the land,  
Figure 12.2. This occurs when excessive rain cannot be absorbed  
in the ground, and runs off hard \(or waterlogged\) surfaces too  
quickly for the drains to discharge it. It is becoming more prev-  
alent in urban areas, where green space has been paved over and  
where drainage systems are old and insufficient for the popula-  
tion. Sewer flooding occurs when too much rainwater enters the  
sewers causing the drains to become surcharged and spill over  
the land.  
**12.2** *Sewer flooding*  
*Source*\: Environment Agency  
• **Groundwater flooding** when the below ground water rises  
above the surface of the ground. This typically occurs in winter  
months or in the rainy season and flooding can last for several  
months until the water level subsides in the summer months or  
dry season.  
• **Failure of artificial systems** such as a dam failure, a burst  
water main or an embankment collapsing. If a collapse or breach  
occurs then this can result in fast flowing water, in unexpected  
locations, catching people unaware.  
# 2.5 Climate change impacts  
Climate change is likely to result in rising sea levels, more intense  
rainstorms and monsoons, higher peak wind speeds, stormier seas,  
higher waves and wetter winters. Today’s extreme events could  
start to become the normal events, and tomorrow’s extreme events  
could be far more extreme than we are prepared for. Sea level  
rise will put low-lying coastal communities at greater threat from  
storms. Intense rainstorms could regularly overwhelm our drains and sewers. Heat waves and drought could put undue stress on  
buildings and landscapes, and it could leave occupiers short of  
water.  
The current consensus, according to the IPCC is that sea levels  
will rise by less than 1 m by the end of the century. However, it will  
not stop rising in 2100.  
These changes create a challenge for planners, engineers and  
designers, demanding a paradigm shift in our approach to new and  
existing settlements.  
# 3 PLANNING FOR FLOOD RISK  
# 3.1 Guiding principles  
Flood risk is one of the most well-recognised constraints to plan-  
ning, typically indicated through flood zones. However, the status  
quo has been challenged by both changing weather patterns and  
through changing technology. Changing weather patterns are  
changing the extent of the flood zones. Changing technology is  
finding solutions to overcome the challenges of flooding, water  
shortage and other issues.  
Strict policies on development restriction within the floodplain  
are advisable. This is not to say that the floodplain must only have  
the one use but that the use should be compatible with its primary  
function to provide space for rivers to expand and flow during  
times of flood. Once this is understood, and integrated into land  
use planning, there is an opportunity to use the floodplain produc-  
tively as part of good town planning. For instance, when preserved  
as parkland it can provide amenity space for high-density devel-  
opment away from the floodplain, transport corridors, urban heat  
island reduction, buffers to storms and habitat.  
There are different approaches to planning in flood risk areas in  
different countries around the world but many follow these prin-  
ciples\:  
• Assess the risk from flooding  
• Avoid building in areas at risk of flooding  
• If this is not possible, then identify less vulnerable uses that are  
compatible with the level of flood risk  
• Design the development to be resilient to flooding \(see Section  
4.5\) without increasing flood risk  
• Ensure, where possible, that there is a means to evacuate to  
safety/higher ground  
• Following these principles may result in a mixture of uses that  
matches different levels of flood risk, often with public space  
along higher risk areas such as riverbanks and coastal areas.  
# 3.2 Location  
Like spatial planning, designing for flood risk is developed at dif-  
ferent scales from a national and regional level through to city  
planning. Detailed planning is developed from a neighbourhood  
level down to a building/plot level.  
Understanding the location within a river or water catchment,  
particularly in combination with an understanding of the topog-  
raphy can help with preliminary assessment of flood risk and the  
appropriate solutions. For instance, in low-lying areas flooding can  
be extensive and long lasting and the water may take a long time to  
drain away after a flood. In hilly areas, the onset of flooding can be  
rapid and unexpected.  
Typically, the upper catchment of a river is set within hillier  
land and often \(though not always\) the lower catchment of a river is  
within low-lying land along the coast. Though there are examples  
of low-lying upper catchments and of mountainous lower catch-  
ments the characteristics described earlier are more common.  
# 3.3 Flood zones  
Flood zones are used to indicate areas of high to low flood risk,  
typically based upon probability of flooding. The Environment  
Agency publishes online maps indicating the flood zones in  
# Flood-resilient design 12-3  
England and Wales. These flood zones indicate the areas that could  
be at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea but ignoring the pres-  
ence of defences. The maps also indicate flood defences and the  
areas that benefit from them. The Scottish Environment Protection  
Agency \(SEPA\) and the Rivers Agency in co-operation with the  
Department of the Environment \(DOE\) publish similar maps for  
Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.  
In England, the flood zones are defined as follows\:  
• Flood zone 1 is considered low probability and is defined as  
areas with less than 0.1 per cent \(1 in 1000\) annual chance of  
flooding from rivers or the sea.  
• Flood zone 2 is considered medium probability and is defined as  
areas with between a 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent \(1 in 100 to 1  
in 1000\) annual chance of river flooding and between a 0.5 per  
cent and 0.1 per cent \(1 in 200 to 1 in 1000\) annual chance of  
flooding from the sea.  
• Flood zone 3 is considered high probability and is defined as an  
area with a greater than 1 per cent \(1 in 100\) annual chance of  
river flooding and a greater than 0.5 per cent \(1 in 200\) annual  
chance of flooding from the sea.  
• Flood zone 3b is also considered high probability. This zone  
includes areas where water must flow or be stored in times of  
flood. It is often \(but not explicitly\) considered to be land that  
has a greater than 5 per cent \(1 in 20\) annual chance of river  
flooding.  
The area of land that would be affected by the 1 per cent \(1 in  
100\) annual chance of flooding is used in many countries to define  
the flood plain. The 1 in 100 flood level is sometimes referred to  
as the design flood level on the basis that floor levels should be set  
above this level.  
The Environment Agency also publishes interactive online  
maps should typically indicating the probability of flooding taking  
into account defences for various flood sources. For rivers, seas and  
surface water these are indicated as very low to high probability.  
The area of high probability is that with a greater than 3.3 per cent  
\(1 in 30\) chance, and is similar to the extent of flood zone 3b, which  
is 5 per cent \(1 in 20\).  
Therefore as a simple reference, the areas of high probability  
give some indication of the highest risk areas. However, it is very  
important that a site specific Flood Risk Assessment \(FRA\) taking  
into account all sources of flooding and local characteristics includ-  
ing topography is undertaken to determine risk to any given site.  
None of these maps indicate how deep the floodwater can be or  
how fast it will flow but give a good idea of the likelihood an area  
may flood and importantly, the need to find out more information.  
A common sense approach to considering flood risk is to look at the  
topography of a site. Water follows the path of least resistance so it  
will typically channel in low valleys and pond in depressions. If a  
site is located on a hill it is not always safe to assume that it is not at  
risk of flooding as it could be within a local channel or depression.  
A site specific FRA can provide a more detailed assessment of  
the hazard, to include depth and velocity of water as well as the  
character of the area whether it is urban or rural.  
# 3.4 Planning policy  
The English planning policy \(National Planning Policy Framework  
\(NPPF\) 2012\) sets out the need to apply a sequential test with  
regards to flood risk when considering sites for development. This  
test is carried out by local government, to determine if development  
can be located on sites with a ‘very low’ probability of flooding  
\(flood zone 1\). If there are not suitable sites for development or if  
there are other benefits of developing sites in flood risk areas, then  
sites in flood zones 2 and 3 can be considered for development so  
long as it can be demonstrated that development\:  
• Provides wider sustainability benefits \(such as enhancing a  
deprived area of a town or cleaning up contaminated land\) **12-4 Flood-resilient design**  
• Will be safe for its users over the lifetime of the development  
\(taking into consideration the effects of climate change\), and it  
will not result in an increase in flood risk elsewhere, and ideally  
reduce flood risk overall.  
Both the ‘sequential test’ and the second test, which is referred  
to as the ‘exception test’, provide a good principle to follow for all  
development in the UK and beyond.  
Key considerations for planning individual development sites to  
reduce the risk from flooding are\:  
• Planning the site to locate the most vulnerable uses in the lowest  
risk areas  
• Provide safe access and escape routes.  
Even where flood defences are provided it is also important to  
consider residual risk of flooding should defences be breached or  
overtopped.  
# 3.5 Use and vulnerability  
The English planning policy identifies vulnerability according to  
five categories, with the aim to protect the most vulnerable users  
and to ensure that key infrastructure that is required to help during  
floods is protected\:  
1 Less vulnerable – which includes shops, offices, warehouses  
2 More vulnerable – which includes dwellings and residential  
institutions, hospitals  
3 Highly vulnerable – basement flats, caravans and mobile homes,  
police, fire and ambulance stations and telecoms centres which  
would be needed during a flood  
4 Water compatible – includes flood defences, marinas, water  
based recreation  
5 Essential infrastructure – including essential transport links, pri-  
mary electricity sub-stations and water treatment works.  
The first three categories of less to more vulnerable uses are  
most relevant to architects and designers.  
A more complete list of uses is given in the NPPF technical  
guidance. This document also provides a table to determine which  
of the vulnerability classifications are appropriate in which flood  
zone and in which flood zones development should not be permit-  
ted \(see Table I\).  
# 4 REDUCING FLOOD RISK  
# 4.1 Introduction  
Planning by means of zoning according to high to low levels of risk  
is only a first step. Flooding may vary in depth, velocity and hazard  
even within one area. Different building technologies and uses may  
be more adapted to one flood hazard than another\:  
• Areas with low flood depths may be managed by variations in  
land levels to raise some areas above flood levels for say hous-  
ing, compensated for by lowering other areas which may only be  
used for gardens.  
• For areas potentially affected by deeper floodwaters, buildings  
may need to be elevated high above the ground or designed to  
float with the rising water.  
• For areas with substantial flood risk, the solution may be for  
regional flood storage areas and wetlands to be provided.  
Measures to reduce flood risk can be structural or non-structural\:  
• Structural measures include flood defences \(soft and hard\),  
building resilience, drainage systems including Sustainable  
Urban Drainage Systems \(SuDS\), temporary barriers.  
• Non-structural measures include early warning systems, flood  
forecasting, land use planning, insurance, evacuation and recov-  
ery plans.  
For most architects, planners and engineers, it is the structural  
measures which will be most relevant. Measures are discussed in  
more detail in the *Cities and Flooding* guide by the World Bank  
\(GFDRR and World Bank 2012\).

The general principle is to direct highly vulnerable uses towards lower flood risk areas  
2 For all sites in flood zones 2 or 3, or for sites with over 10 units proposed or with an area of over 1 hectare it is essential to carry out a site specific FRA. **Flood-resilient design 12-5**  
Different measures are appropriate at different scales. These are  
introduced next.  
# 4.2 Planning and sustainability  
Where flood risk exists on a site, it should be seen as a design driver  
to lead to safe and responsible planning. There are opportunities to  
use areas at risk of flooding for beneficial functions to the devel-  
opment and the wider area. For instance, it is possible to use flood  
storage areas for recreation, helping to contribute to the amenity  
provision for a development. They may also be used for wildlife,  
increasing habitat and biodiversity. In some circumstances, flood  
storage areas can be used for renewable energy technology such  
as wind power, hydro electric, solar farms and tidal turbines.  
This is well illustrated by the Long-term Initiatives for Flood-risk  
Environments \(LifE\) approach \(www.lifeproject.info\) to develop-  
ment, in which flood risk is managed through the creation of parks,  
gardens, public squares and wetlands all designed to form an inte-  
gral part of new sustainable development. This approach, which  
was developed with funding from Defra as part of the making space  
for water programme, is illustrated in Figure 12.3.  
Examples of a new village blue/green along the River Wandle  
in Hackbridge, Figure 12.4, and a tidal flood storage lagoon, Figure  
12.5, along the River Arun in Littlehampton show how making  
space for water to store flood water could enhance the public realm  
with generous public spaces, recreation areas \(on land and water\),  
wildlife walks and new habitat, as well as providing space for  
renewable power generation through Ground Source Heat Pump  
Arrays, and Wind and Tidal Turbines respectively.  
# 4.3 Designing buildings for flood risk  
There are a number of building design improvements that can be  
used to reduce the effects of flooding. Different approaches can be  
implemented, depending on whether they are added to an existing  
building or constructed as part of a new building.  
There are four main approaches to tackling flood risk at a build-  
ing level, Figure 12.6\:  
• Avoidance  
• Resistance  
**12.3** *LifE is an integrated design approach in which measures*  
*to make space for water also help reduce carbon emissions*  
*through sustainable \(Zero Carbon, Passivhaus and Code Level 6\)*  
*development*  
• Resilience  
• Floating.  
A coherent flood-resilient masterplan may consist of a combina-  
tion of the aforementioned building types, organised around urban  
landscape that uses soft and hard landscape that accumulatively  
mitigate flood risk across the site.  
# 4.4 Flood avoidance  
Flood avoidance is the most usual building design measure with  
many examples of buildings on stilts or raised ground throughout  
the world.  
**12.4** *The ‘village blue/green’ provides a flexible informal recreation area, with landscaped hollow designed to regularly accommodate*  
*floodwater and slow the flow downstream. Source\: Baca Architects* **12-6 Flood-resilient design**  
**12.5** *Land at risk of flooding could be elevated above future flood levels on spoil from the excavation of a new, ‘tidal lagoon’, flood*  
*storage area and wetlands. Source\: Baca Architects*  
**12.6** *Different building measures to manage flood risk. Source\: Baca Architects*  
For flood avoidance to be effective, the ground floor level of  
the building must be set above the design flood level, including an  
allowance for climate change and tolerance \(freeboard\).  
• For residential units the floor level is typically required to be set  
above the 1 per cent \(1 in 100\) flood level + 300 mm \(climate  
change allowance\) + 300 mm \(freeboard\).  
• For commercial units, the floor level is typically required to be  
set above the 5 per cent \(1in 20\) flood level + 300 mm \(climate  
change allowance\) + 300 mm \(freeboard\).  
• For residential car parking, the flood level is typically required to  
be set above the 1 per cent \(1 in 100\) flood level.  
• For commercial car parking, the flood level is typically required  
to be set above the 5 per cent \(1 in 20\) flood level.  
Though land raising may seem an obvious solution to reducing  
flood risk it is often not possible as raising the land would result  
in increasing the flood risk elsewhere. Where land raising is to be  
considered, the loss of flood storage would normally need to be  
compensated for by an area of excavation at the same level as the  
area of raising for it to be effective – this is referred to as level for  
level compensation. In areas with limited land level variation, it is  
unlikely to be feasible.  
Working with the natural topography of a site it may be possible  
to reduce the flood risk to areas by increasing the land level whilst  
compensating for the loss of flood storage by reducing levels else-  
where, see case study, Section 5.  
Buildings may be elevated on stilts, columns or walls to raise  
the floor levels above the potential flood level. Buildings elevated  
on stilts or columns help to preserve space for floodwater where  
building raised on walls may still require compensation for loss  
of flood plain, unless there are adequate openings in the walls to  
allow water to pass through. An elevated building can result in  
floor levels being set well above the ground level, requiring raised  
or stepped access routes, which may be at odds with level access  
for disabled users. It may also result in a disconnection between  
the floor and ground level, reducing natural surveillance of streets.  
# 4.5 Flood resistance/dry proofing  
Flood resistance and resilience measures are not normally accept-  
able for new buildings other than to manage residual flood risk  
\(Figure 12.7\). This is because it is safer to avoid flood risk rather  
than relying on flood defences to keep water out or allowing flood-  
water into a building that carries obvious health risks.  
Flood resistance measures include flood defences, flood barriers,  
door guards and back flow drains with the purpose of preventing  
water from entering the property – hence keeping it dry.  
Typically, flood resistance measures are only effective for  
short duration shallow flooding \(below 300 mm in depth or below  
600 mm in depth depending on structural assessment\). Tests  
have shown that floodwater may still infiltrate different building  
constructions designed to resist flooding though the duration of  
resistance may vary. There are examples of buildings designed to  
withstand greater depths of flooding, but these require heavy-duty  
water resisting construction such as tanking, waterproof concrete  
and steel flood doors.  
For most cases, it should be assumed that flood resistance meas-  
ures will only be effective where predicted flood levels are no more  
than 300 mm above the surrounding ground level.  
A flood proofing matrix is shown in Table II.  
# 4.6 Flood resilience/wet proofing  
Flood resilience measures or wet proofing involves constructing  
a building in such a way that although floodwater may enter the  
building, its impact is minimised, the structural integrity is main-  
tained, and the time to clean up and use is minimised \(Figure 12.8\). **Flood-resilient design 12-7**  
**12.7** *A new building at the BRE Innovation Park will show how different building techniques may be used to keep water out \(resistance\)*  
*as well as cope if water enters into the building \(resilience\)*

It relies on using building materials that can survive being water-  
logged without requiring repair or replacement according to the  
Communities and Local Government guidance *Improving the flood*  
*performance of new buildings*. Flood resilience measures are typi-  
cally used where flood depths are greater than 600 mm.  
Water resistance, impermeability, drying ability, rot avoidance,  
mould resistance and replacement are all key considerations for  
materials to provide resilience.  
Resilience measures include\:  
• Raise susceptible infrastructure above flood level \(such as elec-  
tric sockets and supply\)  
• Non-return valves \(fitted to drains\)  
• Secure drainage \(such as sealed drain covers and concrete man-  
holes to prevent pollution and floatation\)  
• Impervious/wash down materials \(such as tiled floors, plastic  
doors, rendered masonry walls\)  
• Solid core materials, \(such as use of solid kitchen units instead of  
chipboard, or solid wall construction below potential flood levels\)  
• Replaceable materials \(such as horizontally fitting plasterboard  
where just the lowest boards can be replaced\).  
The purpose of these measures is to reduce the susceptibility of the  
building fabric to being inundated by water and if they are flooded to **12-8 Flood-resilient design**  
**12.8** *Flood resilience measures. Source\: Environment Agency*  
**12.9** *Amphibious house design. Source\: Baca Architects*  
improve the ability to recover from inundation. Buildings need time  
to dry out thoroughly after being inundated to avoid the risk of mould,  
permanent damage and rot. This may be difficult with materials that  
form part of a composite structure and therefore solid materials or  
construction such as partitions may be preferable below flood levels.  
In addition to the flood depth, the velocity of floodwater and the  
potential for it to carry debris should be considered as high velocity  
flows and debris impact have the potential to cause scour and struc-  
tural damage to foundations and superstructure.  
# 4.7 Floating or amphibious structures  
Floating or amphibious structures are unlikely to be an option for  
managing flood risk in most cases due to the need to site the build-  
ing in water, which is often a high flood risk area, incompatible  
with the vulnerability of the use.  
• Source controls/interception devices \(such as green roofs and  
rainwater harvesting\)  
• Infiltration devices \(such as permeable paving\)  
• Retention and detention devices \(such as ponds, below ground  
storm tanks\)  
• Conveyance devices \(used to transfer water\)  
• Constructed wetlands.  
The aim of source controls, such as green roofs or water butts, is  
to intercept and slow the run off rate of water before it reaches the  
ground and other drainage devices.  
A floating building is, typically, a lightweight structure, which  
rests on a buoyant base or foundation designed to rise and fall with  
the level of the water. The benefit of this form of construction is  
that it can be designed to cope with significant flood depths and  
can respond to variable flood levels, beneficial where there may be  
uncertainty in predictions.  
An amphibious structure, Figure 12.9, is a floating building set  
on or within the ground. It can rest on the ground, only floating  
when the water level rises. These types of construction require  
careful assessment, design and engineering to provide sufficient  
resistance to flood flows, debris and manage services. **4.8 Safe access and egress**  
With all of these building types, it is important to provide safe  
access and egress in the event of a flood. This is particularly rel-  
evant for emergency vehicles, which are likely to be called upon  
during times of flood, and it is a key planning requirement.  
Safe access and egress is not required to be dry but it is required  
to be safe. The Defra document *Flood Risk Assessment Guidance*  
*for New Development* \(Defra 2005\) identifies conditions for creat-  
ing safe access and egress into developments.  
# 4.9 Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\)  
In addition to flood resilience measures, it is also important to mit-  
igate flood risk through drainage control. SuDS provide the means  
to manage rainwater run off so that it emulates natural drainage  
systems. The various devices can be summarised as\:  
The aim of infiltration devices, such as permeable paving and  
underground soakaways, is to facilitate infiltration of rainwater into  
the ground. A soakaway is typically a stone filled circular chamber,  
shallow linear trenches or perforate pipes depending on the depth  
of the groundwater and permeability of the ground.  
Permeable paving may be used in parking areas or paths to  
allow infiltration into the ground or into below ground detention  
tanks.  
# Flood-resilient design 12-9  
It is important that pollution control measures be used to inter-  
cept contaminants from vehicles or other sources, before they have  
the potential to pollute groundwater. Filter strips may be used  
between parking areas to control run off \(Figure 12.10\).  
Retention and detention devices are storm water storage facili-  
ties such as ponds or below ground cellular storage devices, which  
detain water during a storm before releasing via a controlled out-  
flow. They need to be designed to remain \(predominantly\) dry at  
other times to provide effective storage during a storm.  
Conveyance devices, such as swales and filter strips, are chan-  
nels \(typically landscaped\) that transfer water from one device into  
another such as the run off from a roof into an infiltration pond.  
Constructed wetlands, such as ponds and lakes, are neighbourhood  
and regional control measures that emulate the natural benefits of  
wetlands and are usually the last device in larger SuD systems.  
Vegetated SuDS devices \(such as green roofs, walls and planted  
swales\) can also provide environmental benefits, such as cooling  
through evapotranspiration, habitat and visual enhancement. SuDS  
can enhance master planning through increasing the opportunity for  
landscaping, greater provision of amenity and better place making.  
A sustainable drainage system typically comprises a range of  
these devices, which in combination help to detain run off and  
release it slowly into watercourses or to ground, Figure 12.11.  
**12.10** *A filter strip can be introduced between parking bays to manage run off. Source\: Baca Architects*  
**12.11** *Sustainable drainage options. Source\: Baca Architects* **12-10 Flood-resilient design**  
SuDS can include below ground drainage as well as above  
ground drainage solutions. In contaminated areas or in areas  
with poor SuDS, options often rely on storage rather than  
infiltration.  
Water Sensitive Urban Design \(WSUD\) is a term that was  
established in Australia to describe the integration of water cycle  
management within the planning and urban realm. Components  
of this are similar to those used in sustainable drainage but  
expand water management beyond drainage. Good design and  
planning should integrate water management and at all levels of  
development.  
There is much guidance on SuDS available from CIRIA and  
from many technical suppliers. To determine the type and scale of  
system required it is important to carry out ground investigations  
to understand the type of soil and geology. It is also important to  
undertake drainage calculations to determine the storage required  
and run off rates.  
# 5 CASE STUDY – BUILDING IN A FLOOD PLAIN  
Project\: Othello Way, Shipston Road Houses, Stratford-upon-Avon  
Client\: Holloway Properties  
Engineer\: Shire Engineers Ltd  
Contractor\: Greswolde Construction Ltd  
Architects\: Baca Architects  
Completed\: 2020  
# 5.1 Context  
Backing onto a flood plain, the brownfield site, Figure 12.12, is  
designated by the Environment Agency as flood zones 2 and 3.  
This means it has a greater than 1\:100 probability of flooding  
every year. The client Holloway Properties nonetheless wanted to  
develop a group of high quality homes on an attractive location that  
was connected to nature, but also close to the centre of the town.  
# 5.2 Strategy  
Baca Architects proposed raising the homes to a safe level above  
potential floodwater and creating a floodable zone below the  
houses to enable any floodwater to flow within the site in a con-  
trolled manner, Figure 12.13. As a result, the total site footprint  
is mostly floodable, providing flood storage locally and relieving  
flood pressure to neighbouring sites.  
Now complete, this development of 11 homes provides the first  
‘open-market’ housing that is designed to be flood resilient for the  
next century. Baca believes that similarly creative solutions could  
unlock other flood-prone sites to deliver much needed new housing  
in urban areas safely, without the need to expand into the Green Belt.

**a** *Houses in non-flood conditions*  
**b** *The landscape is designed to accommodate floodwater*  
**c** *The raised housing is safe from flooding even when the whole*  
*site is flooded. An elevated walkway allows access through the site*  
**12.13** *Flood resilience strategy*  
# 5.3\. Design  
An elevated footpath provides access to the new houses from the road  
and to the Tramway pedestrian and cycle path to the west of the site.  
Three different house types address the different conditions of  
street frontage, mews housing and the Tramway frontage, all within  
a shared communal garden and amenity space. All principal floors  
are elevated to be above the Environment Agency’s 100 year plus  
20 per cent climate change fluvial flood level thus providing a safe  
haven within the properties. No bedroom accommodation is pro-  
vided at ground floor.  
At the planning stage, the raised floor levels required by the  
Environment Agency’s safety recommendations meant that  
existing street level ridge heights in the area would be exceeded  
in conflict with local planning policy. However, the proposals  
achieved planning permission, assisted by Baca’s policy research  
for Defra and the RIBA.  
The houses are elevated on stilts within a landscape of rain  
gardens and swales, with their voids protected by permeable  
‘flood trims’ around their perimeter, Figure 12.14. Steps and  
amenity terraces that make up the level changes between the  
ground and habitable floor levels are also permeable to encour-  
age the flow of floodwater. Rainwater collected from the roofs  
is drained and stored separately from the space made for river  
flooding. **12-12 Flood-resilient design**  
**12.14** *Site section showing flood migration strategy* **Flood-resilient design 12-13**  
# 5.4 Outcome  
The strategy of designing for the possibility of an entirely floodable  
site enables the creation of housing on previously un-developable  
sites, aiding housing provision, Figure 12.15. For utility com-  
panies, the water storage areas can double as a natural filtration  
system, both slowing down water and enabling them to clean the  
water before it enters the foul drainage system.

in many ways such as graffiti, fly tipping, drug taking, \(under-  
age\) alcohol consumption and dog fouling. Good CPTED can  
reduce ASB and crime significantly, working as the antithesis of  
the ‘Broken Windows Theory’ \(Wilson and Kelling\), which can  
then lead to the increased legitimate usage of an area. This in turn  
increases surveillance and can create a sense of pride in an area  
and a stronger community spirit. This ‘upward spiral’ can continue,  
with safety and increased legitimate usage both positively influenc-  
ing each other.  
Conversely, poor design can create an environment in which  
those who commit crime and ASB feel at home. Legitimate users  
are then less likely to use the area and ASB and crime become  
the accepted norm, which in turn can lead to a downward spiral  
in which the seriousness of incidents can increase and go unchal-  
lenged by the local community.  
# 1.2 Designing Out Crime Officers  
Central to good CPTED is the early involvement of the local  
Designing Out Crime Officer \(DOCO\). DOCO is the more  
recent term for a Crime Prevention Design Advisor \(CPDA\) or  
Architectural Liaison Officer \(ALO\), but the difference is purely  
semantic. The local DOCO will have access to the local crime  
statistics and can speak to police colleagues to ascertain the  
specific problems in a given area. The introduction of various  
websites has made these statistics more accessible for the public,  
but designers should not underestimate the advantage of having  
access to the knowledge possessed by local police officers. The  
term ‘site-specific’ is seldom more important than in the realm  
of CPTED. While good CPTED should be used regardless of the  
area, the level of security deemed necessary will vary greatly.  
Heights of fences, the location of parking provision and the  
required security ratings of locks and other hardware will all  
vary with location.  
Sociological factors have a massive impact on crime rates and  
safety in a given area. What may be deemed necessary in terms  
of security will change with the demographics of the location; the  
level of required security depends on the likelihood of a crime hap-  
pening in a given area.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design  
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design \(CPTED\) is not  
an exact science; it is more a series of considerations that need to  
be weighed up in order to come up with a design that minimises the  
opportunity for criminals. CPTED can work on all levels from an  
individual property to a whole town or city. While there is no defin-  
itive ‘right answer’, it is easy to spot the ‘wrong answers’ where  
CPTED has not been considered.  
The ‘Problem Analysis Triangle’ explains why crime occurs.  
At the three apexes of the triangle are ‘Victim \(or target\), Offender  
and Location’. It is the coincidence of these three in time and space  
that allows for a crime to take place. By working on the location,  
crime can be reduced even if there is still an offender and tar-  
get present, such as a laptop by an open window. For example,  
a well-designed development with well-used and defined access  
routes, together with good surveillance from the houses opposite  
and the use of defensible space outside of the open window, might  
mean the offender feels s/he was less likely to get away with steal-  
ing the laptop.  
Good CPTED has been proven to reduce the incidence of bur-  
glary, robbery and other crimes as well as anti-social behaviour  
\(ASB\). A ‘Secured by Design’ refurbishment of an affordable  
housing scheme in Glasgow resulted in a 75 per cent reduction in  
burglary \(figures from Strathclyde Police\). ASB manifests itself  
# 1.3 Crime reduction  
In the world of policing, CPTED and crime reduction are closely  
related. Crime reduction has traditionally been split into 10 princi-  
ples and there is overlap between these and the principles of CPTED.  
Indeed, one of the 10 principles is ‘Environmental Design’ – this  
essentially means CPTED. The most important distinction between  
the two is that CPTED is pro-active whereas crime reduction is reac-  
tive. Prevention is better than cure and a consideration at design stage  
of the themes to be discussed in this chapter can obviate retro-fit  
measures such as alley-gates, razor wire and the overreliance on  
CCTV. Having anticipated the potential crimes and ASB that may  
occur in and around a development, good CPTED makes the built  
environment less conducive for crime.

**13-1** **13-2 Crime prevention design**  
It used to be thought that by making the commission of offences  
harder in a certain location, crime, especially burglary, would be  
displaced to neighbouring areas. Research has disproved this  
assumption and there can even be a ‘diffusion of benefits’ \(mani-  
fested as a reduction in burglary\) to neighbouring areas. Research  
also shows that burglars tend to operate within a certain radius of  
their home and, when presented with less opportunity locally due  
to good CPTED, are not always willing to travel further afield to  
commit crime.  
# 1.4 Sustainability  
Good CPTED can make developments more sustainable. Taking  
the definition from *Our Common Future* \(1987\), sustainable  
development is ‘development that meets the needs of the present  
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet  
their own needs’. By reducing the opportunity for crime, CPTED  
aims to create safe and secure environments where, other factors  
allowing, residents can enjoy living and where community spirit  
can flourish.  
# 2 RELEVANT LEGISLATION AND PRIMARY  
# PLANNING POLICY  
# 2.1 Section 17 of the crime and disorder act 1998  
This states\: ‘Without prejudice to any other obligation imposed  
upon it, it shall be the duty of each authority to which the sec-  
tion applies to exercise its various functions with due regard to the  
likely effect of the exercise of those functions on, and the need to  
do all it reasonably can to prevent, crime and disorder in its area’.  
The local authority, police authority and fire authority are included  
under this.  
# 2.2 National Planning Policy Framework \(NPPF\)  
*Paragraphs 92, 97 and 130 of the National Planning Policy*  
*Framework \(adopted July 2021\)*  
Requires crime and disorder and fear of crime to be considered  
in the design stage of a development.  
*Paragraph 8 \(b\) Achieving sustainable development*  
Social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy com-  
munities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of  
homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future  
generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built  
environment, with accessible services and open spaces that  
reflect current and future needs and support communities’  
health, social and cultural well-being.  
*Paragraph 108 Promoting sustainable transport*  
In town centres, local authorities should seek to improve the  
quality of parking so that it is convenient, safe and secure,  
alongside measures to promote accessibility for pedestrians  
and cyclists.  
*Paragraph 112 \(c\) Considering development proposals*  
Create places that are safe, secure and attractive – which min-  
imise the scope conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and  
vehicles, avoid unnecessary street clutter, and respond to local  
character and design standards.  
*Paragraph 119 Making effective use of land*  
Planning policies and decisions should promote an effective  
use of land in meeting the need for homes and other uses,  
while safeguarding and improving the environment and  
ensuring safe and healthy living conditions. Strategic pol-  
icies should set out a clear strategy for accommodating  
objectively assessed needs, in a way that makes as much  
use as possible of previously-developed or brownfield  
land.  
# 3 SECURED BY DESIGN  
# 3.1 Introduction  
The term Secured by Design \(SBD\) is owned by the Police Crime  
Prevention Initiative \(PCPI\). This is a police-owned organisation  
that works on behalf of the police service throughout the UK to  
deliver a wide range of crime prevention and police demand  
reduction initiatives. The Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime  
\(MOPAC\) took the opportunity to provide a home to PCPI on  
behalf of the National Police Service. Being a police organisation,  
they have close working links with the National Police Chief’s  
Council \(NPCC\) and Police and Crime Commissioners.  
The SBD standard has two key elements\: A – Layout and design  
and B – Physical security  
# 3.2 Secured by design graded security levels  
Secured by Design has three differing levels of security award,  
starting at the highest level \(SBD Gold\) which incorporates the  
security of the external environment together with the physical  
security specification of the home.  
SBD Silver offers those involved in new developments, major  
refurbishment and the individual the opportunity to gain an award  
for the level of physical security provided.  
SBD Bronze offers a route to achieve a reasonable level of  
physical security for bespoke or refurbished properties where a tra-  
ditional enhanced security product is not available, or cannot be  
utilised due to the listed building or other conservation status.  
More than one million homes have been built to SBD standards  
over the last 30 years.  
The local DOCO administers the developments that apply  
and ultimately decides if developments have reached the required  
standard. Developers can apply for compliance with both parts or  
just with Part B. Early involvement of the local DOCO is vital and  
officers should be consulted at all stages from initial design through  
to handover to the end user.  
# 4 THE PRINCIPLES OF CRIME PREVENTION  
# THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN  
The principles overlap and it is difficult to neatly categorise all con-  
siderations. Other DOCOs may choose to put the principles into  
different categories although there is a general consensus over the  
themes and considerations outlined here. This is why the principles  
should all be considered together when designing a development.  
# 5 ACCESS AND MOVEMENT  
# 5.1 Introduction  
The *Safer Places – The Planning System and Crime Prevention*  
publication \(Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 2004\) defines  
the ideal environmental design as ‘places with well-defined routes,  
spaces and entrances that provide for convenient movement with-  
out compromising safety’. The word ‘permeability’ is used to  
define the ease with which someone may move through an area,  
whether on foot or in a vehicle. The number of roads/paths and the  
ways in which they interconnect are at the heart of this issue. Due  
to the factors mentioned later, cul-de-sacs can prove to be very safe  
places to live providing that there is only one way in and out, and  
there are no paths or alleys leading out of the end. Cul-de-sacs with  
large numbers of houses or networks of cul-de-sacs leading off  
each other also work to counteract the inherent safety of the design.  
# 5.2 Access routes  
Are all of the routes necessary? To and from where does it provide  
access, and is this access needed? The higher the number of routes,  
the fewer the average number of users for each route. A large part  
of personal safety is avoiding quiet routes so increasing the number of footpaths will inevitably result in some of them being underused  
and therefore potentially less safe. A balance needs to be struck  
between the need for easy movement and over-permeability. An  
excess of routes means that a criminal has a variety of escape routes  
and can come and go to the scene of a crime easily without passing  
the same house more than once. As the criminal does not want to  
be spotted or to arouse suspicion, the anonymity afforded by a large  
choice of exits suits their needs.  
Do the access routes divide users of different types? Having  
footpaths alongside roads rather than separated from them allows  
for more passive surveillance of the path by road users, thus \(in  
theory\) making them safer.  
# 5.3 Rear access  
Has access to the back of the property been minimised? The major-  
ity of burglaries involve entry from the rear. Therefore public  
access should be restricted. Different research quotes the percent-  
age of burglaries that involve rear access as anywhere from 55 to  
80 per cent. The proliferation of alley-gating schemes across the  
country has been necessary due to the large number of older estate  
designs that incorporated rear lanes, often for coal delivery. Many  
of these lanes and alleys are not used by the residents but, instead,  
provide burglars with secluded and unobserved access to the rear  
of houses.  
# 5.4 Safe footpaths  
Are the footpaths designed with safety in mind? Where they are  
not adjacent to roads, paths should be wide, straight and well over-  
looked. They should ideally be at least 3 m wide with a 2 m verge  
or mown strip on either side. There should be no possible hiding  
places, therefore trees or shrubs should be set well back from the  
path. Subways and underpasses should be avoided where possible.  
If this is not possible, they should be as short and wide as possible,  
well lit, with chamfered entrances.  
# 5.5 Legibility and navigation  
How legible and easy to navigate are the routes? Locals and visitors  
should be able to find their way easily. Signs should be clear and  
the routes should be easy to understand.  
# 6 SURVEILLANCE  
# 6.1 Introduction  
Surveillance can be split into two categories\: formal and informal.  
Formal surveillance means a person or system is specifically there  
to keep watch on an area. A CCTV system or a security guard  
would be an example of this. Informal, or ‘natural’, surveillance  
is that which occurs as people go about their everyday business.  
People have not been asked or employed to keep watch but they  
oversee nearby people and places merely by their presence.  
Sociological factors play a large role. The principle of safety  
through surveillance relies on the assumption that it acts as a deter-  
rent because people who witness a crime may intervene or call  
the police. In reality, people may choose to turn a blind eye; just  
because a place is well populated does not necessarily make it safe.  
A crowded street with lots of people in close proximity may be  
the ideal environment for a pickpocket, for example. Surveillance  
should therefore be seen as a vital part in the overall design rather  
than as a panacea.  
The main considerations here are\:  
# 6.2 Active frontages  
Do blank walls face the public realm? All aspects of buildings  
fronting the public realm should have windows. A commonly  
used term for this is ‘active frontages’. Windows are the obvi-  
ous ways to offer the chance for surveillance and even if it is  
unlikely that someone may be looking out, a window may deter a  
# Crime prevention design 13-3  
criminal, as there is at least a chance he may be seen. In order to  
generate the maximum amount of surveillance, thought should be  
given to the use of the room containing the window. The chance  
of seeing something from a bed/bathroom is lower than from a  
sitting room or kitchen. Frosted glass would also indicate that the  
room is likely to be a bathroom and therefore being observed is  
less likely.  
# 6.3 Parking surveillance  
Is parking overlooked? Surveillance over parking is crucial unless  
the car park is secure with good access control. The issues with  
parking are discussed in their own section.  
# 6.4 Planting  
Does planting reduce surveillance? Trees and bushes can block  
lines of sight \(for CCTV cameras as well as for people\) and can  
also provide hiding places. Careful thought should be given to  
the location of planting and to the maximum growth heights.  
What may start as a low shrub may grow into a large barrier to  
surveillance and a climbing aid for criminals. Some trees have  
high canopies that allow clear lines of sight underneath. Canopy  
heights should be no lower than 2 metres from the ground.  
Together with the use of shrubs with a maximum growth height  
of 1 metre, such trees still allow for a window of surveillance  
between 1 and 2 metres.  
# 6.5 Lighting  
How will it look in the dark? Lighting must also be considered  
when discussing surveillance. If the designer wants an area to be  
visible 24/7, then it must be lit to an appropriate standard.  
# 7 LAYOUT AND LAND USE  
# 7.1 Introduction  
Building type and usage, together with the nature of the boundaries  
between them and how they interact with each other and with the  
intervening spaces, are all vital considerations in good CPTED. The  
land uses and spaces within a development should all be considered  
together rather than fitting in the ‘less important’ \(often meaning  
less profitable\) features in the remaining space regardless of their  
suitability, as is often done with playgrounds or public open space.  
# 7.2 Uses  
How compatible are neighbouring uses? Consider whether segre-  
gating or mixing land use would be beneficial. There are pros and  
cons to each choice and consideration of local context is therefore  
important. Segregating uses might mean that traffic and noise asso-  
ciated with businesses do not disturb residents; but this may mean  
that there would be no local residents to act as a deterrent to com-  
mercial burglars overnight.  
# 7.3 Crime generators  
Has the impact of possible ‘crime generators’ been considered?  
Crime generators comprise built environment elements that can  
act to increase crime. Out-of-scale facilities such as large shop-  
ping centres can have a detrimental effect on the local area. The  
increased traffic and daytime population of these areas can bring  
associated crime problems which work against the fostering of a  
local community spirit.  
‘Honey pots’ are another potential crime generator. These  
are facilities such as pubs, takeaways or convenience stores that  
encourage people to congregate and loiter in an area, thus poten-  
tially causing ASB and disturbance to local residents. Care should  
be taken when deciding where to position such places within a  
development so as to minimise disruption while maximising legit-  
imate usage. Consider grouping them together to minimise the  
proliferation of negative impacts. **13-4 Crime prevention design**  
# 7.4 Relationship to public realm  
How many faces of a building front the public realm? The number  
of such faces should be minimised to improve security and reduce  
access. For residential properties, it is generally safer to have gar-  
dens flanked by other gardens, with just the front of the property  
facing the public realm. Side access should be gated as close to the  
building line as possible.  
# 7.5 Boundary strategy  
What boundary treatment option has been chosen? Using the  
‘onion peeling’ principle of crime reduction, intruders should be  
stopped as far from the interior of the building as possible. Rather  
than letting people have access to the shell of the building itself,  
stopping them at the boundary is preferable. The standard height  
of boundaries to the rear and side of residential properties is 1.8  
metres; local crime statistics may suggest higher boundaries are  
required. Gates should be the same height as the boundary to either  
side. There are many options for boundary treatments\:  
# 7.6 Boundary materials  
Wooden fencing is cheap but can be flimsy and lack longevity.  
If using featherboard fencing, ensure that the horizontal rails are  
on the inside to avoid creating a makeshift ladder for intruders.  
The addition of a trellis to the top of fencing adds height and acts  
as deterrent as it breaks noisily if climbed. Thorny plants trained  
along a trellis are a further deterrent.  
Walls are sturdy but can attract graffiti. Consider using coping  
stones or angled bricks on the top to deny handholds to those trying  
to climb in. Low walls at the front of houses may be used as seats so  
consider angled bricks or another topping to prevent this.  
Hedges can be cheap and attractive but may require mainte-  
nance and could potentially be breached using secateurs. Some  
thorny varieties can provide excellent protection.  
Railings and metal fences allow surveillance and can be very  
strong but can look too imposing or institutional. Weldmesh or  
expanded metal fencing is generally considered to be a preferable  
option to ‘pallisade’ style fencing.  
# 8 DEFENSIBLE SPACE  
# 8.1 Introduction  
This term, coined by Oscar Newman, is a fundamental concept  
of CPTED. Defensible space describes the area over which one  
feels a sense of ownership or responsibility, whether individual or  
collective. At the micro scale, this may be a back garden. At the  
macro scale, this may be a park that is part of the identity of a city  
of which the city’s inhabitants are proud. The theory is that if an  
individual or group has \(or feel they have\) ownership and responsi-  
bility for an area, then someone who does not share this \(perceived\)  
ownership stands out and is less welcome – especially if misbehav-  
ing. People feel the right to challenge others who do not belong in  
their defensible space.  
By clearly defining space and giving it a use and ownership,  
those who own it are more likely to take care of it, especially if that  
group is small.  
Front gardens are an example of defensible space. There is  
an implied permission to access the front door to deliver a letter,  
but no right-minded person would argue that they had the right to  
sit therein to eat their lunch. Contrast this with houses that front  
directly on to the pavement. Members of the public have a free  
right of access right up to the building line and the resident could  
not legitimately ask pedestrians to move.  
# 8.2 Demarcation  
Blocks of flats have traditionally had undefined areas of pub-  
lic space between them, over which residents have no control.  
Demarcating that space and assigning it to different blocks would  
be a way of improving control in the hope that residents would  
take care of it if they felt it was theirs. While this does not always  
happen in practice, it is usually an improvement on any indistinct  
space that existed previously. Linking back to the idea of anonym-  
ity mentioned in the section on Access and Movement, criminals  
are more likely to be denied anonymity and to feel that they stand  
out in an area with clear ownership over which someone obviously  
takes pride.  
The boundaries to such space need not be high and may com-  
prise merely a line of low plants or a change of texture/colour of  
the pavement or road. A sign may suffice or a high fence may be  
needed. The main principle is that it becomes clear to the outsider  
that this space is not for free roaming.  
# 8.3 Points to consider  
• Is there a buffer between the private and public realm?  
• Is the intended use for each area clear, such as a car park, play-  
ground, garden etc.?  
• Are the boundaries between the different areas clear? Could any-  
one reasonably claim they thought they were in a fully public  
area when they were not?  
• How many people ‘own’ or have shared responsibility for a  
space? The higher the number, the lower the sense of individual  
responsibility felt by each member of the group \(in theory\).  
• Has the appropriate boundary been chosen? Does it need to be  
visually permeable or would a solid wall or fence be better? How  
high should it be? Could the boundary be symbolic rather than a  
physical barrier?  
• Have local people been consulted and involved in the design of  
areas for their use? Consultation can help to foster a feeling of  
ownership among users; this approach has had particular success  
for youth facilities. Community murals are another example of  
where involving local people in a project can help to engender  
pride in the result. Murals are often left relatively graffiti-free in  
comparison to nearby blank walls.  
# 9 MANAGEMENT  
# 9.1 Introduction  
Good CPTED should ensure that a new development will deter  
criminal activity. If, however, no thought is given to ongoing main-  
tenance and management then design work may go to waste as  
the area deteriorates over time. Linking back to the ‘broken win-  
dows theory’, quickly addressing minor issues can prevent them  
becoming serious as it sends out a clear message as to what will be  
tolerated in the area. In order to be sustainable, ongoing manage-  
ment must be considered.  
# 9.2 Points to consider  
• If management is needed, who will pay for it? Will a residents’  
committee or management company be needed?  
• What quality are the materials, products and finishes? Consider  
how long everything should last. Using cheaper products may  
eventually lead to problems.  
• Will plants need maintenance such as cutting and watering? Is  
there access for maintenance vehicles.  
• Will roads be adopted? If not, then there are many issues to con-  
sider such as lighting, road repairs, refuse collection etc.  
• Are there sufficient bins to minimise littering, thus preventing  
excessive street cleaning?  
# 10 PARKING  
# 10.1 Parking options  
The best CPTED option is to accept parking as part of the design  
challenge and to make appropriate allowance for the safe and  
secure parking of vehicles. Individual integral garages tend to be the safest, followed by ‘in-curtilage’ parking \(i.e. on a drive/park-  
ing space on the residential plot\), on-street parking visible from the  
house, followed by remote car parks. In the case of the latter, gated  
parking courts can vastly increase the security. It should be borne  
in mind, however, that if people park in a rear court, they tend to  
enter the house from the rear for convenience; this often means  
rear garden gates are left unlocked and the back of house becomes  
used as the front.  
Convenience plays a big role in people’s decision of where to  
park; few people want to walk far to their car. This can clearly  
be seen at work in many newer estates where parking courts are  
ignored in favour of ‘fly parking’ in front of houses on roads not  
designed to accommodate it.  
# 10.2 Factors to consider  
• What type of parking \(on-street, parking court etc.\) should you  
select? A mixture of types may work best and will depend on  
many things including topography, the likely occupant and prox-  
imity of local services.  
• Is the parking option safe and convenient? If it is not both of  
these things then many will choose not to use it.  
• Are the spaces allocated or not? Research on parking provision  
by John Noble and Mike Jenks \(1996\) indicates that more spaces  
are needed if a high number of them are allocated.  
• If not parked in garages, can residents’ cars be seen from houses?  
Trees and shrubs can hinder surveillance. Car ports are often a  
‘worst of both worlds’ option; they do not allow for surveillance  
yet are not secure and can act as impromptu shelters.  
• Is the car park lit to appropriate standards \(BS 5489 2020 and BS  
EN 13201\)? Lighting helps with surveillance and makes people  
using the car park feel safer.  
• Is the car park easy to navigate with separate spaces for vehicles  
and pedestrians? Clear signage and different ground colours can  
be useful in this regard.  
• If the car park is underground, could it be a target for terror-  
ism? Counter-terrorism security advisors \(CTSAs, contactable  
through the local constabulary\) can advise on these issues.  
Vehicle borne explosive devices are even more lethal if deto-  
nated beneath a building rather than outside it. The use of the  
building above \(e.g. as government offices\) or the potential for  
large numbers of casualties \(e.g. under a shopping centre or  
stadium\) may indicate a higher vulnerability and necessitate  
‘hostile vehicle mitigation’ or mean that an underground car  
park is not suitable.  
• Is CCTV necessary?  
# 11 CCTV  
# 11.1 Introduction  
Per capita, there are more CCTV cameras in the UK than in any  
other country in the world. As the UK is not the safest country in  
the world, it follows that CCTV is not the answer to all problems  
of security. It does have an important part to play in improving  
security but should not be relied on in isolation. The single most  
important question is ‘Why is the system there?’ If designers can-  
not answer this question, they should ask why CCTV is being  
installed.  
# 11.2 Operational requirement  
An ‘Operational Requirement’ should be the starting point for a  
new system. Many systems provide images of poor quality and  
of no use for investigating crime. Many also do not comply with  
the Data Protection Act. CCTV may act as a deterrent but to be  
effective in this regard, someone should be watching the pic-  
tures live and be in a position to call the police. A well-designed  
system considered at design stage can be an excellent crime  
reduction tool.  
# Crime prevention design 13-5  
# 11.3 Factors to consider for CCTV  
• Will images be monitored or will they merely be looked at retro-  
spectively if something occurs?  
• Are fixed cameras sufficient or are ‘pan, tilt, zoom \(PTZ\)’ cam-  
eras needed? PTZ cameras would be more suited to a monitored  
system, enabling an operator to track a person/vehicle.  
• How many frames per second \(FPS\) will each camera record?  
Twenty-five FPS is broadcast standard. The higher the number,  
the smoother the image transition and the lower chance of miss-  
ing something. All of the images need to be stored and the higher  
the frame rate, the more storage is required. Multiply the frame  
rate by the number of cameras by the amount of time the images  
are stored for \(usually 31 days\) and data storage requirements  
quickly mount.  
• How close-up does the image need to be? ‘Identification quality’  
images used to secure convictions usually require the person to fill  
the frame. This means that only a small field of view is covered by  
the camera. If the purpose of the camera is merely to see if someone  
is present in a part of a site, then a much larger field of view will  
suffice. Designers must know what they want from each camera.  
• Does the camera need to function in all light conditions?  
• Can images be exported easily, for example, to police after an  
incident?  
# 12 PLANTING  
Planting can hinder or help a DOCO. Again, this should be part  
of the design process rather than considered as an after-thought.  
Consider\:  
• Will the plant block surveillance, street light or a CCTV camera?  
Remember\: maximum 1 m growth height for shrubs and mini-  
mum 2 m canopy height for trees.  
• Is the species suitable for the location? What size and shape will  
it be when fully grown?  
• Will it act as a climbing aid? Expensive fences can be made  
redundant by running them alongside an easily climbable tree.  
• Will the plant offer a hiding place?  
• Will the plant require ongoing maintenance and who will pay  
for this?  
• Can thorny plants be used to enhance security, especially around  
boundaries? Species such as berberis, pyracantha and brambles  
all help deter intruders.  
• Can shrubs be used to help create buffer zones? Low planting  
against a wall helps keep people a certain distance away so could  
prevent access for graffiti. It could also reduce access to a vul-  
nerable ground floor window.  
• Can planting be used as a means of marking out \(defensible\)  
space? A line of low shrubs may stop people cutting across the  
corner of an unfenced front garden.  
# 13 LIGHTING  
# 13.1 Perception  
The DOCO can provide some advice but a qualified lighting engi-  
neer will be needed for developments of any significant size. Good  
lighting has been proven to reduce the fear of crime but has a less  
proven effect on actual crime. Reducing fear of crime can, how-  
ever, lead to increased legitimate use of an area, which can in turn  
make the area safer. Lighting facilitates surveillance and can be  
essential for CCTV and road safety.  
# 13.2 Footpaths  
Footpaths should be lit to the same standard as the adjacent road so  
that pedestrians are not in shadow. Uniformity is vital and lighting  
schemes should achieve an even spread of light so as to avoid pool-  
ing and shadowing, unless there is a specific reason not to. To work **13-6 Crime prevention design**  
out the uniformity, divide the average lux into the minimum lux and  
express this as a percentage; 25 per cent is the minimum; 40 per cent  
and above is the usual aim. Lighting should be in accordance with BS  
EN 13201 and guidance on lighting design is given in BS 5489 2020.  
# 13.3 Need  
Why is lighting needed? If the area or building gets no use during  
the hours of darkness then what is the use in lighting it? It may  
just facilitate criminal activity. If no one can overlook the area, no  
increased surveillance is facilitated by the lighting.  
# 13.4 Light pollution  
Has light pollution been minimised? The light should be trained  
to where it is needed and prevented from spilling. ‘Security’ lights  
activated by passive infrared \(PIR\) sensors can irritate neighbours  
and dazzle road users.  
# 13.5 Activation  
How will the light be activated? Some turn on automatically in low  
lights, whereas others are activated using a switch or a PIR sensor.  
Energy efficient lights illuminated all night are the preferred secu-  
rity option over PIR-activated types and are usually cheaper to run  
than bright lights that turn on and off in reaction to movement.  
# 13.6 Bulbs  
What type of ‘bulb’ will be used? High pressure sodium, metal  
halide and LEDs are all options. The ‘colour’ of the light is impor-  
tant. Clear daylight is represented as 100 on the colour rendering  
index and allows for excellent differentiation between colours.  
Low pressure sodium on the other hand gives a very orange light  
under which many colours appear similar.  
# 13.7 Housing  
What housing will be used for the lighting and at what height?  
Bollard lighting can be vulnerable to vandalism, can be a reversing  
hazard and can fail to illuminate the faces of anyone approaching; it  
therefore becomes difficult to judge if people appear friendly or not.  
# 14 SECURITY HARDWARE  
The ‘Secured by Design’ scheme goes into great detail on this  
topic. The ‘Secured by Design Homes 2019’ document is the guide  
used by DOCOs. Much hard CPTED work can be negated by fit-  
ting inferior hardware. Doors, windows, gates, fences and the locks  
and bolts used to secure them are essential elements of a devel-  
opment. Compliance with Gold/Silver/Bronze SBD is all about  
using the right hardware and this alone can hugely reduce the risk  
of burglary.  
If additional security is needed such as roller shutters, then it is  
easier and cheaper to design this in at the start rather than installing  
them later. Other design features may assist the burglar in bypass-  
ing hardware. Walls, porches, flat roofs etc. may facilitate access to  
first floor windows that are more likely to be left open or unlocked.  
Designers should imagine how they would break into the building  
they are designing.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 The agricultural economy  
Agriculture in the UK and the rest of Europe \(particularly in the  
West\) is becoming big business. Small farms and small farmers  
are becoming increasingly rare; marginal land is coming out of  
production. Owners of hitherto agricultural land are seeking other  
revenue-earning uses such as golf courses.  
# 1.2 Planning  
Buildings, irrespective of the enterprise, should be planned in terms  
of their functions for storage, processing or production. Food, like  
other industrial processes, should be designed for materials han-  
dling and flow-line production. Superimposing linear buildings  
within or over traditional courtyard forms is both a visual and a  
tactical problem.  
Stock housing produces effluents. Farm waste management is  
an essential part of the building design and increasingly subject to  
statutory control. Wastes should normally be recycled, provided  
that this is done safely.  
# 1.3 Building functions  
Depending on managerial philosophy, building functions may be  
specialist, semi-specialist or flexible in their form. Farmers tend to  
equate flexibility with general-purpose layouts and with low capital  
investments; this can be a false equation. The loss of quality con-  
trol, often difficult to evaluate, makes most ‘cheap umbrellas’ poor  
performers for specific end products.  
The demand for flexibility reflects two factors – lack of confi-  
dence in stable markets and the rapidity of technical change, which  
is liable to continue.  
# 1.4 Stock housing and storage requirements  
In simple terms, most storage requirements are those of contain-  
ers\: cylinders, bins and bunkers. Wide-span portals are suitable for  
some layouts for cattle, bulk storage and general farm machinery.  
Compact and insulated ‘boxes’ of low profile are best for calves,  
pigs or poultry. They may include total or partial environmental  
control. In contrast, ‘kennels’ are cheaply framed, semi-open,  
mono-pitch structures suitable for some cattle and pig layouts.  
# 1.5 Building development and legislation  
Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, development  
requires planning permission. Although there are exceptions, many  
farm buildings and developments are no longer classed as permit-  
ted development under planning law. Details of all schemes have  
to be sent to the local planning authority together with a fee. The  
authority will rule in each case whether further information needs  
to be submitted for formal planning approval before work can com-  
mence.  
Particular developments normally requiring formal planning  
approval include\:  
• Buildings for non-agricultural purposes  
• Dwelling houses  
• Conversions of farm buildings to commercial or industrial or  
residential use  
• Buildings not designed for agriculture, e.g. containers, lorry bod-  
ies, etc.  
• Buildings exceeding 465 m2 – in any 2-year period within 90 m –  
includes yards and slurry lagoons  
• Buildings 12 m and over in height  
• Buildings 3 m and over in height within 3 km of an airfield  
• Buildings within 25 m from the metalled part of a classified road  
• Livestock buildings within 400 m of a ‘protected building’  
• Caravan sites for which special rules apply  
• Holiday cottages  
• Recreational pursuits of a recurring nature, e.g. adventure games,  
canoeing, hang-gliding, windsurfing, water skiing, need consent  
if exceeding 28 days per year  
• Farm shops\: permission is needed for shops if produce is not  
derived from the farm involved and for new buildings to be used  
as shops. Particular care is required over access, parking and  
advertising signs.  
# 1.6 The Building Regulations 2010  
Many agricultural building are exempt from the Building  
Regulations 2010 – but not all. The following extract from the  
Regulations details the buildings that are exempt – all others are  
subject to Building Control and details must be submitted to the  
Local Authority before work commences.  
Schedule 2 – Exempt Buildings and Works  
Regulation 9 – Greenhouses and Agricultural Buildings

retailing, packing or exhibiting.

growing, the growing of plants for seed and fish farming – or  
a building principally for the keeping of animals, provided in  
each case that\:  
a\) b\) c\) No part of the building is used as a dwelling  
No part of the building is less than one and a half times its  
height from any point of a building which contains sleep-  
ing accommodation, and  
The building is provided with a fire exit which is not more  
than 30 metres from any point in the building.  
# 1.7 Performance specifications  
Most buildings are partially or wholly prefabricated, or are pur-  
chased under package deals. Standard frames can be obtained off  
the shelf and infilled by self-build.  
Performance specifications are rare. Overall costs are lower  
than for most buildings of similar type, partly due to lower stand-  
ards being demanded. The key standard for agricultural buildings is  
BS 5502 *Buildings and Structures for Agriculture*.  
# 1.8 Lifespan of buildings  
Most pre-1960 buildings are inefficient for modern production and  
many traditional buildings are redundant. A few are suitable for casual  
storage, administration, isolation units or spare boxes. The issue of  
redundancy is not easy to resolve. Some historic barns have been  
dismantled and relocated. Tourism, recreation and craft work are  
all encouraged in rural areas. A tenth of all farms have some tour-  
ist income. In upland areas, it may be the principal source of income.  
Farm planning should allow for alternative uses for buildings and land.  
The normal economic life for farm buildings is 10 years, though  
some are depreciated over five. This is a major design constraint.  
Some estates may permit a longer term of 20–60 years, especially  
for ‘umbrella’ enclosures. Grants are available for all except plas-  
tic, cheap tents and for factory farms \(i.e. without supporting land\).  
The moving, alteration or demolition of historic farm buildings  
may be subject to listed building legislation. Some unlisted struc-  
tures are also subject to listed building consent because they are  
curtilage structures to a listed farmhouse or manor house\: the dem-  
olition of an unlisted but curtilage building usually requires listed  
building consent even if their alteration and repair does not.  
# 1.9 Appearance  
Farm building appearance, especially since many are exempt from  
control and since most are cheap compared to other building types,  
is a contentious issue. Simple forms, good colour, defined planes  
and coordinated fittings such as vent pipes and flues, combined  
with careful siting and landscaping, make buildings acceptable.  
However, large roof surfaces are likely to conflict with vernacular  
buildings and can, near rising land, become dominant. Component  
design is often poor and unrelated to the basic structure. Surrounds  
to buildings, including yards, tanks, fences, etc., are often more  
unsightly than the buildings.  
# 1.10 Criteria  
Farm management in relation to resources of land area and terrain,  
climate, soil, capital, and so forth, is such that every farm building  
problem is different, despite prefabrication, package deals and BS  
5502\. In many enterprises, it is difficult to establish a good design  
brief.  
The basic layout, Figure 14.1, shows the relationships between  
the elements of the farm and the main service road. Figure 14.2  
shows a typical farm.  
# 2 FARM ANIMALS  
Average sizes and weights of animals are shown in Figure 14.3.  
Width of animal given is normal trough space allowed \(i.e. about  
two-thirds of overall width\). Length given is normal standing \(not  
fully extended\).  
# 3 FARM MACHINERY  
Average sizes and weights of tractors and other machinery are  
given in Figure 14.4.

**14.3** *Farm animals\: average sizes and weights*  
# 4 DAIRY CATTLE HOUSING  
Table I gives dimensions for cattle housing; examples suitable for a  
120-cattle unit are shown in Figures 14.5 and 14.6. A typical cubi-  
cle house is 27 m wide × 55 m long plus 10 m turn area at one end  
plus a 4 m road. A ‘kennel’ has the same basic dimensions but  
the roof is lower and is held by the cubicle division and the pas-  
sage is not completely roofed, as Figure 14.7. Various systems of  
milking parlour are shown in Figure 14.8. Rotary parlours are now  
considered obsolete, and the current favourite is the herringbone,  
Figure 14.9.  
# 5 BEEF CATTLE AND CALF HOUSING  
Straw-covered and slatted yards for beef cattle are shown in Figures  
14.10 and 14.11. A calf house illustrated in Figures 14.12 and 14.13  
is a ‘general-purpose’ straw-covered yard for cattle \(700 mm/head  
for manger for adults, 500 mm for yearlings\). **14-4 Agricultural buildings**

**10 EQUESTRIAN DESIGN** *Housekeeping*  
# 10.1 Horse riding today  
Facilities for keeping horses are mainly constructed for recrea-  
tional riding, equestrian sport and breeding purposes. The use of  
horses for commercial haulage is unusual nowadays, and together  
with police or military facilities there is likely to be a specific  
brief.  
• Tack room  
• Cleaning room\*  
• Drying room\*  
• Staff lavatories/showers  
• Staff rest room\*  
• Office\*  
• Vet room.\*  
**10.2 Planning elements in private stables** Private stables range from a stable for one horse to large com-  
plexes to accommodate a thousand horses or more, complete with full health and training facilities. The principal elements remain the same, Figure 14.35, and are based on the physical and psychologi-  
cal requirements of the horses. *External facilities*  
• Midden  
• Washdown area\*  
• Trailer parking  
• Staff parking  
• Carriage store.\*  
*Boxes Health/exercise*  
• Loose boxes • Sand roll  
•  
\*Sick box/boxes \(50 per cent larger\) • Lungeing yard  
•  
\*Utility box/boxes. • Treadmill  
• Weighing machine/weigh bridge  
*Stores*  
• Equine pool  
• Feed  
• Hay \* In many cases, the accommodation will not require these items  
• Bedding because of their small-scale activities.  
• Equipment \(wheelbarrows, mowers, etc.\). A typical plan is shown in Figure 14.36. **14-18 Agricultural buildings**  
**14.37** *Measurement of the height of a horse at the withers.*  
*Traditionally the height was measured in hands \(4 inches\), but a*  
*hand is equivalent to a decimeter \(100 mm\) within the limits of*  
*accuracy attainable. Table VI gives the heights of a number of*  
*breeds of horses and ponies*

• Transportation, Figures 14.49–14.51.  
# 10.4 Stabling and environmental conditions  
The principal requirements can be identified as follows\:  
• Dryness and warmth  
• Adequate ventilation without draughts  
• Adequate supply of water and good drainage  
• Good daylight and good artificial light. **14.39** *Dimensions of the horse and rider, see Table VII* **Agricultural buildings 14-19**

**14.43** *Veterinary box ‘Stallapotheke’*  
*Siting*  
• On well-drained ground  
• Avoid the tops of hills and hollows  
• Protected from severe prevailing winds  
• Avoid sites hemmed in without free circulation of air.  
*Temperature*  
The stable should moderate extremes of exterior conditions.  
Therefore, a degree of air circulation is helpful and adequate venti-  
lation essential. However, care should be taken to avoid draughts.  
*Size*  
Unless a particularly small breed is kept the standard dimensions  
should be adhered to.  
*Noise*  
Sudden noise may startle horses and disrupt sleep during the night;  
therefore, relationship to public roads or urban developments  
requires careful consideration.  
# 10.5 Detailed stabling design  
*Floor*  
The floor should be impervious to moisture, hard wearing, nonslip,  
easily cleaned and protect the horse from any ground moisture.  
Selection of floor finish can vary from dense concrete, granolithic  
concrete or engineering brick-laid herringbone pattern to proprie-  
tary rubber mats and seamless rubber flooring.  
*Walls*  
The walls should be smooth for cleanliness and, wherever possible,  
free from projections. It is preferable that masonry walls are pro-  
tected up to at least 120 mm by stout timber or plywood panelling  
on battens. Masonry should be painted white or a light shade to  
encourage cleanliness. Horses are gregarious animals and therefore  
it is normal for the partitions to be solid up to 1200–1500 mm and  
have a metal grille up to 2100 mm above floor level.  
*Ceilings*  
The ceiling should not be less than 3050 mm high and care should  
be exercised in the choice of materials to avoid the build-up of  
condensation.  
*Fire resistance*  
In large installations, the fire resistance of the structure and the  
location of fire separation barriers should be carefully considered  
bearing in mind the difficulty of evacuating frightened horses and  
the often rural location.  
**14.44** *Tack rooms a\) saddles and bridles together, side view; b\)*  
*saddles and bridles, front view; c\) saddles only; d\) bridles only,*

*tilted to give self-vision*  
**14.50** *Large trailer*  
**14.51** *Small trailer*  
**14.47** *Dressage arena*  
*Doors and windows*  
Doors to loose boxes should be positioned to one side of the box to  
allow the horse to keep clear of the draught when the upper half is  
left open. Doors to two adjoining boxes should not be placed next  
to each other. The door should open back to 180° and any exposed  
edges be protected with a galvanised steel capping to avoid ‘crib  
biting’. There should be no sharp arrises, and a minimum clear  
width of 1200 mm. Windows should, where possible, be fitted at  
high level. Any low-level windows should have Georgian wired  
glass and a steel protective grille.  
*Fittings*  
Usually, these will consist of a manger, drinking water receptacle  
and two tie rings. The exact position of these items will depend to  
some extent on the management of the stables, and to whether auto-  
matic replenishment is incorporated. Tie rings are generally fixed  
between 1525 and 1800 mm in order to avoid a horse dropping a  
leg over the tie.  
*Services*  
An exterior quality plug socket will be required \(one per six stalls  
maximum\) for portable equipment. This should be sited outside the  
stall. Artificial lighting should provide illumination to both sides of  
the horse switched from outside the stalls. **14-22 Agricultural buildings**  
*Drainage*  
The floor should be laid to a fall of between 1\:80 and 1\:60 to a  
gulley outside the stall or loose box. Channels may be formed to  
enhance drainage. Good housekeeping is the key to drainage and  
all gullies should be equipped with a removable perforated bucket  
to collect bedding and feed that may wash down the gulley.  
*Midden*  
The midden must be arranged so that effluent does not run away  
into groundwater. There should be a gulley and an adjacent water  
supply to enable regular periodic cleaning. For hygiene reasons, it  
should be sited away from the stables.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
The following introduction and Sections 2–9 and 11 relate to audi-  
toria for performing arts, conference and multi-purpose auditoria,  
while Section 10 relates to the specific requirements for cinema  
exhibition.  
There are many forms and types of auditoria space, which can  
vary in shape, volume, size and function. The relationship between  
the stage or platform and audience can also vary depending on the  
type of performance or presentation. Typically, different types of  
performance or presentation are housed in particular forms of audi-  
toria space. For example, auditoria spaces suitable for music will  
be different from spaces for drama, dance, music theatre, opera or  
even conference use. The scale of space in terms of seating capac-  
ity may further accentuate the form of auditoria space.  
The 3D volume of an auditorium is conditioned by the need for all  
members of the audience to be able to see the whole of the platform  
or stage; and to hear the actor, singer, musician or speaker. Seating  
density, floor rake and seating layout are partly determined by this,  
partly to give the audience an appropriate level of comfort and essen-  
tially to ensure a means of escape in an emergency, such as a fire,  
within the time required by safety considerations and by legislation.  
in form fronting very large and well-equipped stage houses with  
a large orchestra pit for musicians. Accommodate opera and  
ballet.  
• *Concert halls*\: Accommodate an audience of between 1500 and  
2000 in a hall with a generous volume that provides a good nat-  
ural acoustic for classical music \(see Section 8\).  
• *Recital rooms*\: Typically accommodate smaller-scale, classical  
music performances to audiences of 200 to 600.  
• *Dance theatres*\: Require a large, rectangular stage area with  
adjacent wings and an objective, frontal sightline for the audi-  
ence. Audience sizes can vary from 300 to 1400. Often share  
accommodation with other auditoria spaces.  
• *Drama theatres*\: Vary considerably in capacity, which can range  
from 100 to 1200 and in form, which varies from proscenium  
or end stage; thrust; arena or in-the-round; traverse stage \(long  
or short axis\); corner stage or L-configuration and promenade  
performances \(see Section 5\).  
• *Musical theatres*\: Typically follow the format of large-scale  
theatre spaces traditionally found in London’s West End and  
New York’s Broadway. These have large, well-equipped  
stage houses, usually set behind a proscenium frame open-  
ing with the auditorium and typically seat between 1500 and  
2000.  
• *Entertainment venues*\: Vary considerably in scale from adapted,  
large-scale auditoria spaces through to very large-scale arenas  
where more popular forms of entertainment can be staged, such  
as pop music, circus shows and other forms of mass entertain-  
ment. These venues fall into three broad seating capacities\:  
smaller-scale venues seating from 1500 up to 6000, mid-scale  
arenas seating 6000 to 12000, and large-scale venues seating  
more than 12000.  
• *Conference halls*\: Designed for speech where audience members  
are also able to communicate openly with speakers or presenters  
on the platform. Seating capacity varies from 300 seats to 1200  
\(see Section 9\).  
• *Flexible auditoria spaces*\: Specific requirements of particular  
auditoria forms make the notion of flexible theatres difficult to  
achieve without some level of compromise. A rigorous approach  
to the design of the space is required with a good understanding  
of the different performance formats to be accommodated \(see  
Section 5.14\).  
# 3 PLANNING AND LAYOUT  
# 2 TYPOLOGIES  
The types of auditoria spaces most commonly found include\:

spaces seating between 1200 and 2200. Traditionally horseshoe  
# 3.1 Auditorium  
The auditorium is the principal space in the theatre, concert hall,  
opera house or conference venue. Within the venue, the auditorium  
is supported by the front-of-house or public areas, which include  
the foyers and public spaces and the backstage areas, those parts of  
the building that comprise the working areas of the venue which are  
generally outside the public domain and which support the work  
presented in the auditorium.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-18 **15-1** **15-2 Auditoria**  
Within the auditorium, the critical relationship is between the  
audience and the performer or presenter on the stage or platform.  
The audience should be able to see and hear clearly, whatever is  
happening on every part of the stage or platform. This is an ideal  
rarely \(if ever\) totally attainable in practice. However, a clear view  
for everyone of the main part of the stage or platform is normally  
achievable in modern auditoria. Where an existing building is  
undergoing renovation, further compromises may well be neces-  
sary for some seats.  
Different forms of auditoria space have developed to suit the  
particular criteria that benefit the presentation of different art forms  
\(music, dance, drama, etc.\) or types of presentation.  
In more recent times, there has been a much more dem-  
ocratic and egalitarian approach to the design of auditoria  
spaces, where audience members are treated more equally in  
terms of entrances and access to different parts of the audito-  
rium and better quality sightlines and acoustic or aural quality  
for all.  
Technological advances also allow theatre producers and direc-  
tors to experiment with the staging of productions, which can lead  
to demands for greater technical access and capability.  
# 3.2 Seating capacity  
Seating capacities should be based on a clear understanding of  
the business model and programming profile for the venue. A half  
empty auditorium is not nearly as conducive to creating a good  
atmosphere as a full one, and considerably more expensive to  
operate.  
A range of physical factors needs to be taken into account  
when considering the size of auditoria spaces for different forms  
of presentation. Contemporary standards of safety, comfort and  
access have reduced the number of seats that can be accommo-  
dated within visual and aural limits. These constraints now set the  
maximum capacity for drama at around 1000 seats rising to 2400  
for musicals and opera where the sound of voices carries further.  
The advent of amplified sound and large screen projections of the  
performers has allowed audiences of up to 20000 in arena style  
formats.  
# 3.3 Visual limitations  
Visual limitations, see Figure 15.1, determine the maximum  
distance from platform or stage at which the audience is able to  
appreciate the performance and for the performers or speaker to  
command an audience. This distance varies according to function  
type and the scale of the performance\:  
• *Drama* – 20 m measured from the setting line of a proscenium  
stage or geometric centre of an open stage in order that the audi-  
ence can discern facial expression.  
• *Opera and musicals* – up to 30 m away since performers  
enhance facial expression through more exaggerated gesture and  
make-up.  
• *Dance* – should not exceed 20 m. The audience needs to appre-  
ciate the whole body of dancers, including on the floor and to  
be able discern choreographic movement patterns, but facial  
expression is less important.  
• *Full symphonic concerts* – while acoustic conditions predomi-  
nate, being able to discern individual musicians playing can also  
be a benefit.  
• *Chamber concerts* – acoustic conditions predominate and visual  
definition engages the audience.  
• *Conference* sp*e*akers *and lecturers* – 20 m is the maximum for  
discerning facial expression. For larger-scale venues, AV pro-  
jection of the speaker can assist.  
• *Slide, video, television, overhead projector and other*  
*projections* – visual limitations are determined by their respec-  
tive technologies.  
**15.1** *Visual and aural limitations. a\) Plan\: for a performer at*  
*centre stage B there is an arc Y beyond which visual and aural*  
*perceptions are impaired. However, for performers nearer the*  
*sides of the stage at A and C, the greater distances across the*  
*auditorium result in a more restricted arc as illustrated by curve*  
*X; b\) Section\: Similarly, visual and aural limits drawn in section*  
*will prescribe an arc centred on the performer, beyond which*  
*definition is impaired*  
# 3.4 Aural limitations  
This refers to the distances across which speech, singing and music  
can be clearly heard without the need for amplification, and beyond  
which they cannot. Sung words carry much further than the spoken  
word enabling a singer to fill a much larger volume, while musical  
instruments tend to carry further than the voice. For drama, opera  
and classical music amplification is deprecated, but it is acceptable  
for variety and pantomime and essential for rock music. For ampli-  
fied sound, the auditorium requires a dry or dead acoustic with  
no reflected sound from the platform or stage and limited or no  
reverberation loudspeakers are positioned to provide full and even  
coverage of the audience.  
The volume and quality of the unamplified sound is dependent  
on the volume, shape, size and internal finishes of the auditorium  
and its resultant reverberation time. It is therefore not possible to  
lay down limits as for visual appreciation.  
Acoustic specialists should be consulted over the acoustic mod-  
elling of the auditorium to ensure the appropriate acoustic quality  
and acoustic isolation are achieved. To achieve a natural fullness  
of sound for music, the right spatial volume for the hall is a critical  
starting point with appropriately located and formed acoustic sur-  
faces. As an initial guide, a volume in the order of 10 m3 per seat  
should be allowed, but the dimensions and acoustically reflective  
surfaces of the space for music must also be considered.  
The acoustic response of a space can be varied, for example, by  
adding more acoustic absorption in an over reverberant space or  
by adding acoustically reflective surfaces in other areas to ensure  
sound reaches all parts of the auditorium in a harmonious manner.  
These techniques can be used where adaptable acoustics are needed  
to vary the acoustic to suit different presentational needs, such as  
for music or speech.  
In recent years, where multi-purpose auditoria require different  
acoustics conditions to suit different presentational types, such as a  
dry acoustic for speech or alternatively a more reverberant acoustic for music, electronically enhanced acoustics have been developed  
to allow the acoustic quality of the space to be changed electron-  
ically.  
# 3.5 Audience engagement, intimacy and cohesion  
Audience engagement, cohesion and intimacy are the central tenets  
of good auditoria design. The vital experience of live productions  
or performances is most immediate when there is a shared and  
cohesive experience by the audience and an engagement with the  
actor or performer on the stage. From the perspective of the actor  
or performer, to be able to hold the attention of the audience in a  
coherent grasp has much to do with how the audience is arranged  
in the auditorium. Empty spaces, reduced density or gaps in the  
audience positioning tends to weaken audience cohesion, detract-  
ing from the connectedness of the experience.  
This relationship is especially important for drama, where an  
actor’s ‘point of command’ or angle of vision over the audience  
is around 130°. Greater intimacy can be achieved by locating the  
audience closer to the actor and this has led to auditorium formats  
where the audience increasingly surrounds the actor. The greater  
the encirclement of the audience of platform or stage, the more  
people can be accommodated within aural and visual limitations,  
such that the most subtle or nuanced gesture, expression or sound  
can be picked up by the audience.  
The sense of enclosure that might be appropriate for drama can  
be very different for the appreciation and enjoyment of orchestral  
music, where an expansive volume and musical envelopment are  
more appropriate qualities.  
# 3.6 Levels in the auditorium  
Seating gradients in an auditorium are determined by calculating  
the sightlines from each row to the stage or platform. With a sin-  
gle level only, the pitch of the rake requires particular attention  
to achieve a sense of enclosure for larger numbers of audience  
members relative to the stage or platform. The Ancient Greek  
amphitheatre is the exemplar.  
Within aural and visual limitations, an alternative means of  
increasing seating capacity can be the addition of one or more  
balconies within the overall permissible volume of the audito-  
rium. Similarly, boxes, side galleries and loges can be added to  
the sidewalls, especially in the case of the proscenium format. This  
‘dressing’ of the auditorium walls with people is seen in many  
auditoria types from horseshoe-shaped opera houses to courtyard  
theatre spaces and traditional music halls, where it was essential to  
pack in as many people as could be contained within the auditorium  
volume.  
# 3.7 Seating standards  
The following data is based on the ABTT Technical Standards  
for Places of Entertainment was published by The Association of  
British Theatre Technicians \(updated July 2020 and annually\) and  
British Standard BS 9999\: 2017 *Code of Practice for Fire Safety*  
*in the Design, Management and Use of Buildings*. This latter code  
has replaced the earlier BS 5588 in 2009. While BS 9999 and the  
ABTT Technical Standards provide a sound basis on which to plan  
projects, it should be noted that different countries have their own  
particular standards to comply with.  
# 3.8 Standards for designing accessible buildings and  
# facilities  
The information needed to create an inclusive environment from  
the outset of a project is set out in Part M Vol 2 of the Building  
Regulations, Approved Document M1 Section 4 – Access and use of  
buildings other than dwellings and British Standard BS 8300\:2018  
*Designing of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment*.  
The ABTT Technical Standards for Places of Entertainment  
also provides clear guidance on the requirements for entertainments  
# Auditoria 15-3  
buildings. This applies in all areas of auditoria spaces includ-  
ing entrance lobbies as well as the number, size and location of  
wheelchair spaces in the auditorium \(see Section 3.23 Wheelchair  
locations\). BS 9999 gives recommendations for satisfactory means  
of escape \(egress\) arrangements for disabled people.  
Disabled people should be able to obtain service from all facil-  
ities available within the premises, including cloakrooms, bars and  
box offices without undue difficulty. Ease of access, heights of bars  
and counters and environmental matters should be carefully con-  
sidered with this in mind.  
Facilities should be provided for deaf and hard-of-hearing  
people and for blind and partially-sighted people as well as for  
wheelchair users and other people with impaired mobility.  
Further guidance may be found in BS 8300. However, the rec-  
ommendations given in BS 8300–2 Section 17 are not suitable  
for closely seated managed auditoria such as found in places of  
entertainment. For such venues, the guidance set out in the ABTT  
Technical Standards for Places of Entertainment, Section C2  
*Seatways and Gangways* along with the statutory requirements of  
*Approved Document M* and the guidance in Section N *Management*  
should be used.  
Consideration should also be given to how to make the  
environment, facilities and programme of arts venues accessi-  
ble to people with mental impairment and diverse neurological  
conditions. Impairment or behaviour may be a result of con-  
ditions which include but are not limited to dementia, autism,  
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette’s syndrome  
and so forth. Further guidance may be found in *Becoming a*  
*dementia-friendly arts venue\: A practical guide* \(Alzheimer’s  
Society, 2015\).  
# 3.9 Seat module  
Auditorium seating broadly falls into the following categories\:  
• Benches, with and without backs  
• Fixed seats, with or without arms  
• Tip-up seats, with or without arms  
• Conference seats, with a writing top and wired communication  
services.  
It is important to establish the seat module early in the design  
process, taking account of the need to balance considerations of  
individual comfort, commercial imperatives and audience com-  
pactness and theatrical intimacy. Seat design has developed  
considerably and greater comfort can now be achieved in more  
compact seats, with flatter and less heavily profiled backs \(see 3.13  
Seating density\).  
Where seats are designed for level or slightly upward sightlines,  
these seats may have a more reclined back taking up more space  
than those with more upright backs for more downward facing  
sightlines in the higher areas of the auditorium. Seats in the front  
rows of balconies and steep tiers will also need additional space for  
feet if there is no overhanging rail or front.  
It should also be noted that seat widths can be marginally  
adjusted between rows to allow for a line of seats at the end of rows  
with gangways to provide consistent escape widths to gangways.  
Seating types and dimensions are set out in Table I\:  
# 3.10 Seating rows  
Traditionally, the maximum numbers of seats in a row was 22 \(for  
rows with gangways at both ends\) and 11 \(for rows with a gang-  
way at one end\). The advent of what is sometimes referred to as  
‘continental seating’ allowed row lengths of up to 28 seats with  
gangways at both ends by increasing the back-to-back dimension  
between rows. Table II gives the permissible number of seats in a  
row for a given seatway width. **15-4 Auditoria**

500 or more 12 Limited by travel distance  
to place of safety  
In auditoria spaces where there is a greater degree of encircle-  
ment of the platform or stage by the audience, more people can be  
accommodated within the bounds of aural and visual limitations.  
Beyond an arc of 180° of encirclement, clear speech directed from  
actors will become more difficult to hear away from sections of the  
audience when the actors are facing away. This problem becomes  
more acute with full encirclement, when a practical limitation may  
be in the order of six rows distance from platform or stage, unless  
other means are developed in the auditorium design to reflect sound  
back.  
# 3.11 Row-to-row spacing \(seatways\)  
Spacing is controlled by the clearway between the leading edge of  
the seat \(in an upright position, if tip-up seats\) and the rear of the  
back of the seat in front; see Figure 15.2. For traditional seating,  
the minimum clearway for people to pass along the row is 300 mm  
and this dimension increases with the number of seats in a row.  
Continental seating is a term sometimes used when the clearway is  
not less than 400 mm and not more than 500 mm.  
**15.2** *a\) Row-to-row dimension and clearway with fixed*  
*seating. b\) Row-to-row dimension and clearway with*  
*tipped-up seating*  
The clear seatway is primarily focused on means of escape but  
is equally important in terms of access. The longer the row the  
more people will have to pass one another within the row, and the  
wider the seatway the easier this is. In auditoria where the audience  
may comprise a significant proportion of elderly people, shorter  
row lengths than the maximum are desirable.  
Legislation also dictates the minimum row-to-row dimension at  
760 mm\: this is usually not adequate and the minimum should be  
850 mm for traditional seating with 900 mm being a good starting  
point.  
# 3.12 Gangways  
The ABTT Technical Standards set out standards in Section C2 for  
*Seatways and Gangways* and Section N for *Management* policies  
and also refer to the standards set out in BS 8300–2.  
As gangways are essential escape routes, their widths are deter-  
mined by the number of seats served. The minimum is 1100 mm.  
In Scotland, the minimum is 1200 mm, so always check local legis-  
lation requirements. They can be ramped up to an incline of 10 per  
cent \(5.7° or 1\:10\), but only 8.5 per cent \(4.9° or 1\:12\) if likely to be  
used by people in wheelchairs. If the seating rake is steeper, gang-  
ways must have steps extending the full width and these must have  
consistent treads and risers in each run. This means that the row-to-  
row spacing and row rise should be compatible with a convenient  
gangway tread and riser; and this in turn means that the shallow  
curve produced by sightline calculations should be adjusted to a  
straight line.  
# 3.13 Seating geometry  
Seating is usually laid out in straight or curved rows focused  
towards the platform or stage. Further forms are the angled row,  
straight row with curved change of direction and straight rows  
within more defined blocks of seats; see Figures 15.3 and 15.4.  
# 3.14 Seating density  
Early Victorian theatres had very dense seating capacities with  
audience members crammed tightly into the available area. This  
created intense audience experiences. However, people are now  
getting larger and expectations of safety and comfort levels  
have moved on. There are also cultural and regional sensitivities  
where senses of personal space may influence comfort and spatial  
standards.  
Seats with arms and tip-up seat can occupy a space as small  
as 500 mm wide \(for seats without arms, such as benches or indi-  
vidual seats, this can reduce to as little as 450 mm wide\) with a  
row-to-row dimension of no less than 760 mm. Seats can range up  
to as large as 750 mm wide by 1400 mm; see Figure 15.5, but this is  
extreme and more suited to cinemas than theatre spaces. However,  
a good practice minimum is between 850–900 mm for row-to-row  
widths and 525–550 mm for seat widths.  
The area per seat therefore varies between 0.38 m2 and 1.05 m2  
.  
Increased dimensions reduce seating capacity and audience den-  
sities. Minimum dimensions as laid down by legislation offer a  
relatively low standard of comfort and should not be taken as a  
norm, but the social cohesion of the audience may be lost if the  
standards are too high.  
In conference halls where writing space is required, lower den-  
sities are inevitable; see Figure 15.6.  
# 3.15 Accommodation capacities  
To calculate the seating capacity of an auditorium space, calculat-  
ing seating capacities by seat areas is not sufficient as the escape  
gangways, widths and auditorium circulation also need to be taken  
into account.  
However, Table III \(taken from the ABTT *Technical Standards for*

people who may be accommodated in different categories of space  
without overcrowding. These floor areas generally exclude escape  
routes and circulation spaces that will not be occupied when the prem-  
ises are in normal use. Seatways and gangways within a closely seated  
auditorium are generally allowed for in this table.  
Where large numbers of performers or presenters are located  
on a stage or platform, sufficient escape provision should be made  
from these areas.  
# 3.16 Foyers with circulation, bars and gathering spaces  
Foyer spaces are now expected to perform a variety of functions  
beyond providing circulation and assembly spaces for audi-  
ences entering the auditorium. These include refreshment bars,  
sales kiosks for programmes and merchandising, cloakrooms,  
sponsors rooms or spaces, and activity or events areas. All  
need separate spatial and economic consideration.  
To calculate the basic level of foyer space for assembling the  
audiences for an auditorium with a given seating capacity, each audi-  
ence member should be multiplied by a factor of a square metre to  
provide the overall area of foyer space. A commonly given standard  
is 0.75 m2 per audience member for seated audiences, but this can  
range from 0.6 m2 per audience member where audience members  
would be tightly packed in to 1.5 m2 for generously provided foyer  
spaces with lounge areas. For events where there may be standing  
audiences, the total capacity of the auditorium should be taken into  
account when these numbers are gathered in the foyer areas.  
Where auditoria are laid out on a number of levels, it is appro-  
priate to provide foyer spaces at each level to correspond with the  
number of audience members at each level. Layouts should avoid  
bottlenecking during intervals and provision should be made for  
wheelchair users.  
# 3.17 Sightlines for a seated audience  
The sightline criteria need to be established from the outset defining  
how much of the stage area or platform must be seen, including  
the stage floor, back and sides of the performing area and upward  
sightlines for scenery and aerial effects where these are relevant. It  
is then possible to develop the geometrical volume within which the  
required number of seats can be contained by taking into account all  
the visual, spatial and aural criteria set out in the preceding sections.  
The methodology set out in Sections 3.17 to 3.23 is a guideline  
through the basic geometrical criteria. 3D modelling is recom-  
mended as a means to test and develop the initial concept and form  
of the auditorium space, viewing sightlines from each seat position.  
# 3.18 Vertical sightlines  
A number of key points need to be determined in order to estab-  
lish the stalls rake and develop a vertical, downward sightline for  
every member of the audience that provides an uninterrupted view  
of the platform or stage over the heads of the row in front; see  
Figures 15.7 to 15.9.  
*Point of sight \(P\)*  
This is the lowest and nearest point of sight on the stage or platform  
for the audience to see clearly. Its position can vary considerably  
vertically and horizontally depending on what must be seen of the  
performance or presentation. Where, for example, there is a variable  
forestage, point ‘P’ must be established for this position. Point ‘P’  
can be more onerous for dance performances where the feet or body  
of a dancer lying on the floor must be seen. For music, point ‘P’  
can be located higher up, for example at chair seat level or 450 mm  
above the platform to be able to view the musicians playing.  
*Horizontal distance \(HD\)*  
This is the distance between the eyes of the seated members of  
the audience, which relates to the row spacing and can vary from  
760 mm to 1150 mm or more.  
*Offset \(O\)*  
This is the horizontal distance between the position of eye offset  
from the position of the riser or step. While the horizontal distance is  
determined by the back-to-back dimension between rows, it does not  
normally coincide with the treads or risers. In reality, the degree of off-  
set is related to the design of the seat and how far the seat back reclines  
and oversails the structural riser. For early planning, 100 mm offset  
is a reasonable assumption of the eye position in relation to the riser.  
*Average eye height \(EH\)*  
Average eye height is taken as 1120 mm above the theoretical floor  
level\: the actual eye point will depend on seat dimensions.  
*Top of head \(TH\)*  
This is the distance from the centre of the eye to the top of the head  
and is normally taken as 100 mm for the basis of sightline calcu-  
lations. For assurance that there is a clear view over the heads of  
those in the row in front, this dimension should be a least 125 mm.  
However, it is normally argued that an angled view between the  
heads of those in the row in front combined with 100 mm allow-  
ance provides a good basis. **Auditoria 15-7**  
**15.7** *Graphic representation of vertical sightlines, P lowest and nearest point on stage clearly visible by audience, HD horizontal*  
*distance between eyes in successive audience rows, EH average audience eye height above floor, E height between eye and top of head,*  
*D distance from eye of person in front row to P*  
**15.8** *Vertical sightlines for proscenium stage*  
getting steeper as the distance from point ‘P’ increases. This gives  
every member of the audience similar viewing conditions, but will  
also result in a relatively steep rake. While licensing authorities  
will accept incremental heights to risers in stepped aisles for gentle  
rakes where the differences are imperceptible, for steeper rakes,  
steps are generally arranged in a series of angled sections.  
While steeper rakes are satisfactory for a single tier of seating  
with no balconies, they can be especially appropriate for open stage  
formats, especially in smaller auditoria where the audience is par-  
tially or wholly surrounding the stage with a limited number of  
rows. An increased seating rake can encourage a sense of enclosure  
of the stage, while providing good sightlines, but should be bal-  
anced with the subjective view of the performer that it is preferable  
for the performer to have half the audience below their standing  
eyeline to avoid the sense of being located in the bottom of the  
auditorium.  
Figure 15.10 shows how the eye position relates to the seat and  
the stepped floor.  
**15.9** *Vertical sightlines for open stage*  
*Distance of front row eye position \(D\) to point ‘P’*  
For the front row of seats, the distance from the eye position of  
the average audience member in the front row to point P. The rela-  
tionship is shown in Figure 15.7. For raked seating, the closer the  
distance, the steeper the resulting rake. Also, the lower that point ‘P’  
is to the floor \(such as for dance or drama\) will increase the rake.  
Working back from point ’P’ through the auditorium will estab-  
lish the theoretical rake of the stalls seating. Calculating sectional  
sightlines row-by-row will result in a parabolic seating profile,

*inclinations of both seat and back. Working dimensions are*

# 3.19 Sightlines across lateral gangways  
Lateral gangways can be problematic because of how they interrupt  
the continuous line of the auditorium rake. With lateral gangways,  
the line of the auditorium rake must continue so that the audience  
can see the performance area over the gangway as if part of a con-  
tinuous sightline gradient. Stepped rows require a handrail to the  
upper side of the gangway and, if a steep rake, a handrail to the  
lower side; see Figure 15.11.  
# 3.20 The view between heads  
If a balcony or balconies are introduced, the rake of the lower bank  
of seats can be reduced, assuming vision to be every other row  
allowing for point P being seen between heads in the row in front.  
To reduce the degree of rake in the stalls seating, the vertical dis-  
tance between eye point to top of head \(TH\) can be reduced to  
65 mm for calculation purposes if seats are staggered.  
When working with between-heads sightline criteria, it should  
be on the basis that the seating is staggered. This is normally calcu-  
lated on the centre line, but as rows extend sideways, particularly  
with curved rows, seats will invariably coincide partially blocking  
the between view. However, seats located towards the sides of the  
auditorium tend to have a more diagonal view of the stage, which  
can alleviate this condition.  
The view between heads is particularly applicable with the  
design of a large auditorium where the aim is to maximise the seat-  
ing capacity within the visual and aural limitations. This implies a  
balance between sightlines, height of the auditorium and seating  
capacity. Reducing the height of the lower level of seating in the  
auditorium allows more space to accommodate upper balconies.  
Refining the sightlines in this manner illustrates the balancing of  
requirements necessary in the development of larger auditoria.  
# 3.21 Upper tiers or balconies  
The principles for establishing sightlines in the upper seating levels  
are fundamentally the same as for the stalls. Allied to the vertical  
downward sightline is the upper sightline, particularly in prosce-  
nium-framed auditoria where upward sightlines from rear rows of  
seats in stalls and balconies have an uninterrupted view of the top  
of the proscenium.  
*Point of sight \(P2\)*  
As with point ‘P’, point ‘P2’ is the lowest and nearest point that an  
audience member seated in the balcony needs to be able to see. This  
can be the same as for the stalls position, but it can also be different  
from the stalls, such as for a forestage extension or a view of the  
conductor in an orchestra pit.  
*Depth of the stage \(DP\)*  
This is the working depth of the stage or acting area.  
*Highest point visible at the back of the stage \(HP\)*  
This is the clear visible height at the back of the stage or performing  
area. It is important for the audience to not only be able to see the  
backdrop, but where for example a set design may have an upper  
tier or balcony, a raised choir or backing musicians on the stage or  
even aerial props, devices or flown performers.  
*Proscenium height \(PH\)*  
This is the height of the proscenium opening or the upper defined  
limit of an open stage, such as the underside of a lighting bridge,  
lighting bar or pelmet. The panel above the proscenium opening  
may be used to provide subtitles during a performance.  
*Balcony front height \(BF\)*  
For the benefit of the calculation, the balcony may be assumed to  
be 790 mm while recognising that this will need to be at 1100 mm  
for raised rails at the end of aisles. The design of the balcony front  
is a critical item as the shape and form of the balcony riser and top  
rail can impede downward views if its impact on sightlines is not  
considered, particularly from oblique or side views.  
*Distance to front row \(D\)*  
In this case, this is the distance from the front row of the balcony  
to point ‘P2’.  
# 3.22 Horizontal sightlines  
Horizontal sightlines are relevant to proscenium and end stage  
auditoria spaces particularly for dance, where a frontal view of the  
whole stage area is critical. They are also relevant to platforms for  
classical music where acoustic considerations may also apply.  
A frontal viewpoint is also important for film, video and slide  
projection.  
Given a particular stage, platform or performance area defined  
by the proscenium opening, horizontal sightline constraints limit  
the width of the seating area in the auditorium. The view of the  
proscenium opening cannot be too oblique otherwise audience  
members will not be able to see much of the stage area masked by  
the proscenium frame.  
**15.11** *Sightlines at transverse gangway; the angle of the rake line is constant* **3.23 Side seats**  
Side seats can create a more engaging and cohesive ambiance in a  
multi-tiered auditorium and have the benefit of bringing audience  
members closer to the action on the stage or platform, but they can  
also be problematic requiring careful consideration. The amount of  
side seating needs to be balanced as part of the overall provision.  
Where the seat is focused away from the platform or stage, such  
as with side galleries requiring the head to be turned sideways, it  
is debatable how far it remains comfortable for extended periods.  
Without head movement, the arc to view the whole platform or  
stage on plan is 40° from the eye; see Figure 15.12.  
Turning the seat to face towards the stage or platform is some-  
times a solution, but this can take more space while the diagonal  
sightline is extended; see Figure 15.13a–b.  
The horizontal sightline of the performer may also need consid-  
eration; see Figure 15.14.  
**15.12** *The angle of horizontal vision for a stationary head is 40°*  
**15.13a** *The maximum comfortable amount the head can be turned*  
*from the seat centreline is 30°*  
**15.13b** *If the head angle were to exceed 30°, the seats may be*  
*angled within the row*

**15.14** *Horizontal sightlines of the performer \(also referred to as*  
*‘point of command of performer’, the range of audience an actor*

# 3.24 Wheelchair locations  
Locating wheelchair user positions seamlessly and effectively  
into an auditorium landscape can present a key challenge in  
the design of auditoria spaces while taking account of all other  
auditorium design considerations. Positions of wheelchair users  
should therefore be considered at the outset and not added as an  
afterthought, with wheelchair spaces provided in various parts  
of the auditorium to allow different vantage points. Care is  
needed in the design and location of wheelchair spaces so that  
all visitors can enjoy the ambiance of the event. A designated  
wheelchair area in a lecture theatre is shown in Figure 15.15 and  
possible locations of wheelchair spaces in front of a rear aisle in  
Figure 15.16.  
Wheelchair users and those with sensory or mobility impair-  
ment may need to view or listen from a particular side or sit  
in the front for lip reading or to read sign interpreters. Some  
people have difficulties looking up or down or from one side  
or another, so choice of positions is as important as choice in  
response to ticket price. They should be provided with spaces  
into which they can manoeuvre easily and which will offer a  
clear view of an event, while also ensuring they are not segre-  
gated into detached areas.  
A wheelchair user should be able to sit with a party of friends  
not in wheelchairs, or with friends also using wheelchairs. The  
location of wheelchair users as discrete areas can be at the rear,  
front, side or within the body of the seating.  
Wheelchair users and people who have difficulty in using seats  
with fixed arms as well as those with assistance dogs should also  
have the choice of sitting next to conventionally seated person  
or a companion wheelchair user. Consideration should also be  
given to providing an area next to certain seats for an assistance  
dog to rest.  
By having some removable seating at the front and at the back  
of blocks of seats, greater flexibility in location can be achieved  
and a greater number of wheelchair users than the minimum provi-  
sion shown in Document M of the Building Regulations.  
Greater spacing between rows of seats or at the end of rows  
may provide extra legroom for people of large stature. With several  
seats removed, these locations may also be suitable for wheelchair  
users.  
All users of the auditorium should be able to move safely and  
easily to and from seating areas to ancillary facilities, such as  
WCs.  
When it comes to building accessibility guidelines, there are  
two main standards that should be worked to – Document M \(Part  
M Vol 2 of the Building Regulations, Approved Document M1  
Section 4 – Access and use of buildings other than dwellings\) and  
BS 8300 \(BS 8300–2\: 2018 \(Part 2\: Buildings – Code of Practice\)  
*Designing of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment*\).  
The ABTT Technical Standards for Places of Entertainment  
makes a clear distinction between conference or lecture theatre  
auditoria and ‘theatrical’ entertainment auditoria. In facilities for  
entertainment, such as theatres, it is normal for seating to be more  
closely packed than in other types of spectator facilities.  
There is currently a divergence in the standards set by Approved  
Document Part M and BS 8300–2, which sets out a higher stand-  
ard for auditoria spaces, such as lecture theatres and conference  
centres. The BS 8300 standards were developed by the British **15-10 Auditoria**  
**15.15** *Wheelchair spaces in a lecture theatre \(from Part M\)*  
Standards Institute \(BSI\) and defines the best practices for design-  
ing accessible and inclusive environments, whereas Document M  
applies only to England and is a legal requirement. The updated BS  
8300 standards are focused on maximising inclusivity and strive to  
incorporate accessible design into mainstream design, rather than  
having specific features and facilities designated as ‘accessible’. In  
Scotland, BS 8300–2 is set out as the reference standard, but is not  
mandatory.  
The ABTT Technical Standard states that the recommenda-  
tions given in BS 8300–2 are unlikely to be suitable for closely  
seated, managed auditoria as found in places of entertainment. The  
ABTT’s guidance is focused on meeting the legal requirements  
for theatres or places of entertainment in England as stated in  
Approved Document Part M but refers to the aspirations set out in  
BS 8300–2 for lecture theatre and conference auditoria.  
Regulations require a minimum of six places for wheelchair  
users, or 1/100th of the audience capacity, whichever is the greater.  
Tables IV and V set out the standards expected by both authorities.

This table comes with the following commentary\:  
• The provision of wheelchair spaces reflects the ability to use  
removable seating to increase the provision in response to  
changes in demand.  
• The provision of wheelchair spaces in audience seating should  
be as shown in Figure 15.1.  
• The arrangement of wheelchair spaces and removable seating  
should permit a wheelchair user to sit alongside another wheel-  
chair user or seated companion.  
• Wheelchair spaces should be located in different parts of the  
auditorium to provide a range of vantage points, provided that  
the view is unobstructed.  
Figure 15.15 gives an example of wheelchair spaces in a lecture  
theatre from Part M of the Building Regulations.  
The same layout principles apply in BS 8300–2, but increase  
the provision of wheelchair spaces using the seating capacities as  
given in Table V.  
Sightlines of wheelchair users should be checked, as there  
can be some variation in eye height and type of wheelchair used.  
See also Chapter 4, Inclusive and accessible design The sight-  
lines of audience members located behind wheelchair positions  
must also be checked as the head of wheelchair users can also  
be higher than audience members seated in standard auditorium  
seats.  
An issue can arise where a level resting position for wheel-  
chair user conflicts with raked seating areas. The designer needs  
to consider how this might be managed without creating trip  
hazards between the rake and the edge of level seating areas.  
Locating wheelchair places on the level at the rear, at the front  
or the level from a cross aisle can provide effective ways of  
addressing this issue proving adjacent seating spaces are also on  
the level.  
Where backing into wheelchair seating positions is required,  
generally at the end of a row, access into the row behind for other  
audience members can be blocked, requiring the wheelchair person  
to move to allow access or require additional seats to be removed  
to allow clear access. Rear access into wheelchair positions, such  
as auditoria spaces with tiers or balconies tend to be more easily  
accommodated into auditoria spaces and allow for users to exit  
more discretely if required during a performance.  
# 3.25 Circulation  
While gangway lengths and widths are calculated as part of the fire  
escape route, they also provide the circulation through the audito-  
rium, with possible additional gangways from the audience entry  
points to individual rows and seats.  
# 3.26 Entry points  
The entry points into the auditorium need to connect directly with  
the gangways and will also be determined by the maximum travel  
distance from rows of fixed seats for means of escape purposes \(see  
3.28, Means of Escape\). The audience can enter from the rear of the  
auditorium, at the sides or in auditorium with in-the-round or thrust  
stage configurations through vomitory entrances.  
The areas around auditorium entrances also serve as useful  
locations for selling programmes, as well as for ticket checks and  
space for audience members to orientate themselves.  
Entrances and exits located near to the stage area will be  
required to have illuminated emergency exit signs. While the  
visibility of exit signs is important in case of emergency, poorly  
located exits can detract from the performance if within competing  
audience sightlines.  
Vomitory entrances can occupy a considerable number of good  
seating positions, so their locations need to be carefully consid-  
ered, while sight lines around the vomitories need careful attention.  
When vomitories are also used as entrances and exits for perform-  
ers, their location relative to the stage or performing area also needs  
careful planning so that extended distances do not detract from the  
element of surprise of performers arriving or exiting the perfor-  
mance area; see Figure 15.17.  
# 3.27 Doors and lobbies  
Observation doors in auditorium entrance areas can cause oper-  
ational problems in entertainment venues because of the need to  
exclude light and sound from darkened auditorium spaces. Curtains  
are not acceptable but management solutions where attendants sta-  
tioned by the entrances and exits can hold open or close doors as  
necessary to help people in and out of the auditorium. Doors must  
open in the direction of escape. Further guidance can be found in  
the ABTT Technical Regulations.  
Lobbies may be provided for heat insulation, sound or light  
reduction and/or fire protection. They must be designed so that  
users are not likely to be trapped or impeded by the doors.  
See Figure 15.18 taken from ABTT Technical Regulations for  
minimum lobby sizes and layouts.  
# 3.28 Fire safety  
Fundamentally, there are two alternative approaches to fire safety  
design although the principles for each will be similar\:  
• Code-based design, which satisfies the standards set out in the  
local building codes  
• Fire-engineering design, which develops a project specific fire  
safety strategy that may offer more flexible solutions, particu-  
larly for complex buildings like theatres, including the removal  
of the traditional fire safety curtain.  
For further detail and legislation, see also Chapter 11, Fire  
safety, this volume. Specific guidance on fire safety matters in  
theatres is provided in The Technical Standards for Places of  
Entertainment, 2015 \(sometimes referred to as ‘The Yellow Book’\)  
published by the Association of British Theatre Technicians, the  
Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the District Surveyors  
Association and the Institute of Licensing.  
# 3.29 Means of escape  
The aim is for all in the auditorium to be able to escape to a  
place of safety within a set period of time. The escape route is  
from the seat, along the clearway and gangway, and through exit  
doors immediately, or through an enclosed corridor, to a place  
of safety. UK guidance on the distance from a seat to a place of  
safety for means of escape is set out in British Standard BS 9999\:

*Travel distance*  
In auditoria with fixed seated rows, a maximum travel distance of  
15 m in one direction is permissible, with 32 m as a limit when  
escape is possible in two directions \(of which only 15 m can be in  
any one direction\). In open floor areas, a maximum travel distance  
of 18 m in one direction is permissible, with 45 m as a limit when  
escape is possible in two directions.  
*Capacity of exits*  
The recommended maximum capacity of means of escape is shown  
in Table VI.  
The aggregate capacity of the means of escape or several exits is  
calculated by adding together the maximum number of people who  
can safely use each exit to escape – and not by adding together the  
widths of the various exits. For example, the capacity of three exits  
each 800 mm wide is \(3 × 60 people\) = 180 and not the capacity of  
a single exit 2400 mm wide.  
Each exit from the auditorium must lead directly to a place of  
safety.

Escape routes should be uniform in width and no less than the  
width of the exit, but may widen in the direction of escape. The  
clear width is measured at its minimum point, which is often a door  
set, not the corridor. They need to be wide enough to allow peo-  
ple to move quickly to escape from the premises. Corridors and  
passageways should allow for the manoeuvre of wheelchairs and  
permit other people to pass. There must be no bottlenecks and all  
doors within the route must open in the direction of escape.  
Routes within the building should have fire-resistant enclo-  
sures. There are special requirements for all doors opening onto  
fire escape routes.  
The clear width is dictated by the numbers of people exiting  
and as outlined in Table VI. Generally, exit doors should be no less  
than 1050 mm and means of escape routes no less than 1200 mm  
\(but within existing buildings may reduce to 800 mm for exit doors  
and 1000 mm for means of escape\). See also British Standard BS  
9999\: *Code of Practice for Fire Safety in the Design, Management*  
*and Use of Buildings*. Also refer to BS 8300\:2018 *Designing of an*  
*Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment*.  
# 3.31 Stairs  
The width of the stairs is the clear width between the walls or balus-  
trades. Handrails \(including any handrails and subdividing barriers  
on wide stairs\) may be ignored as long as each does not project  
more 100 mm into the escape route. Any additional projection  
should be treated as a reduction in the clear width of the stair.  
Stairs wider than 1800 mm should be subdivided into widths  
not less than 1100 mm wide. This means that stairs wider than  
1800 mm should be at least 2200 mm wide.  
The aggregate capacity of any stairs forming part of the means  
of escape from any floor should equal or exceed the accommoda-  
tion limit for that floor. Where a stair serves more than one floor,  
the capacity of the stair should equal or exceed the aggregate  
capacity of the exits opening onto it.  
Recommended maximum capacity of stairs is shown in  
Table VII.  
# 3.32 Steps treads and risers  
Best practice is set out in the following list\:  
• Flights of stairs should have no fewer than three steps  
• Any landings between flights should be at least as long as the  
width of the stairs  
• The rise of a flight between landings should not exceed 1800 mm  
• There should be not more than two successive flights without  
a turn \(this does not apply, however, to auditoria with stepped  
gangways, which should not be regarded as stairs\)  
• The pitch of any stair should be uniform throughout

Note\: Each exit and means of escape has to be in a materially different direction, i.e. separated by an angle of at least 45° from the point of escape at the end of a row or aisle. If  
the travel distance along a row or aisle is possible in one direction only, this must not exceed 15 m.  
Notes\:  
1 Numbers of staff can usually be disregarded in areas primarily occupied by the public.  
2 Capacities in excess of 220 may be calculated on the basis of 5 mm per person per exit. Thus when two or three exits are available, the basis is 2.5 mm or 1.67 mm per person.  
3 Other arrangements are possible with capacities in excess of 600 provided the aggregate capacity of the exits less any one exit is sufficient and each exit is in a materially  
different direction.  
4 Widths less than 1050 mm generally apply only to exiting buildings. Exits from stages should be at least 1200 mm irrespective of the size of the stage. **Auditoria 15-15**

• Nosing should not exceed 25 mm  
• Preferably no step should overlap with the step below  
• Risers should be between 150 mm and 170 mm.  
# 3.33 Refuges  
Refuges should be provided in accordance with BS 9999. A ref-  
uge is a location of relative safety where people whose abilities or  
impairments might cause delayed evacuation can wait for assis-  
tance with the next part of their escape. However, it is not to be  
used as a place to leave disabled people for rescue by the fire ser-  
vice. Consideration should be given to the likely number and size  
of refuges and allow for bigger powered wheelchairs  
Refuges should be\:  
• Accessed in the direction of escape  
• Located in a protected corridor, protected lobby or a protected  
room adjacent to a protected stair  
• Accessible to the mobility-impaired person and provided with a  
communication system  
• Include a number of wheelchair spaces in refuges that equals  
or exceeds the provision of wheelchair spaces accessible to the  
refuges  
• A single wheelchair refuge should be at least 900 mm by  
1400 mm and clear of the prescribed escape passage  
• Have corridors 1200 mm wide to allow turning through  
180 degrees.  
# 3.34 Ramps and slopes  
Guidance for ramps in theatre buildings is provided in the ABTT  
Technical Regulations, which are also consistent with Approved  
Document Part M. BS 8300 also provides guidance on ramps for all  
new buildings, which may be difficult to achieve in many existing  
theatres and entertainments buildings.  
Wheelchair users should be provided with flat or ramped escape  
routes, which may be separate from other routes. Where there is  
need for a small change in level, such as for one or two steps, a  
ramp should be provided.  
Any ramp should be\:  
• No steeper than 1\:12 \(5°\) and no longer than 2 m between land-  
ings or  
• No steeper than 1\:15 \(4°\) and no longer than 5 m between land-  
ings or  
• No steeper than 1\:20 \(2.9°\) and no longer than 10 m between  
landings  
• Have at least 2.1 m headroom above the ramp  
• At least 1.2 m wide at floor level \(1.5 m wide in public spaces\)  
and at least 1.0 m wide measured at 1.5 m from floor level.  
Any ramp should also have\:  
• A level landing at the top and bottom of the same width as that  
of the ramp and at least 1.2 m long  
• Any intermediate landing of the same width as that of the ramp  
and at least 1.5 m long; landings should be clear of any door  
swinging onto it  
• Handrails on both sides of the ramp  
• Any open side of a ramp or landing should have a 100 mm high  
kerb.  
In theatres and entertainments buildings, gradients for sloping  
floors in the auditorium are generally governed by the need to pro-  
vide good sightlines to the stage or performance areas. In many  
historic theatres, the gradient of stalls floors may be as steep or in  
a few cases even steeper than 1\:9 \(or just over 6 degrees\), while  
the gradient in many will be around 1\:12 \(or 4.9 degrees\). See also  
Section 3.12 Gangways. These floor gradients were sometimes  
matched with raked stage floors, which further improved sightlines.  
The trend for flattening stage floors to make the technical oper-  
ation of theatre spaces less complicated has placed more emphasis  
on achieving good sightlines within the auditorium. To address  
these issues, the designer has to determine whether it is better to  
substitute shallow, elongated steps in the auditorium or provide  
gradients which are steeper than acceptable for ramped passages  
and escape routes.  
The key is to address the needs of disabled people in the audi-  
torium \(as described in Section 3.8 and 3.24\) and for the venue to  
put in place management policies which provide for their needs.  
All these issues will need to be considered in the round in order to  
come up with appropriate strategies and acceptable solutions.  
# 3.35 Handrails, barriers and guarding  
Entertainment venues often have many levels to which the public  
has access. Lighting levels may be low and some audience mem-  
bers have had something to drink, while children can be excited and  
not always effectively watched over. Particular care is needed to  
ensure that edges of all stairs, ramps, balconies and other changes  
of level are guarded effectively to avoid accidents. Backstage areas  
also need to be addressed with equal care and where often for pro-  
duction purposes spaces are dark.  
Any handrail should give firm support and allow a firm grip. A  
handrail can form the top of a barrier if the height can be matched  
and meet the requirements of the barrier. Steeply raked seating \(in  
excess of 25°\) should have hooped rails or similar supports at the  
end of rows with gangways; see Figure 15.19. Generally, loop rails  
should relate to any change in level over one riser as this better  
meets the standards for universal access than basic building reg-  
ulations.  
Barriers should generally be designed so that a 100 mm diame-  
ter sphere cannot pass through, unless it can be shown that children  
will not be admitted to the premises.  
Handrails, barriers and guarding are governed by legislation and  
should be provided to all stairs, ramps, landings, balconies, galleries  
and other changes in level exceeding 380 mm \(see Table VIII\).  
# 3.36 Balcony fronts  
The front of the balcony in auditoria can be set at 800 mm provided  
the front row of seating is not more than 530 mm. The height of the  
balcony front guarding in front rows of seats can be further reduced **15-16 Auditoria**  
**15.19** *Loop guardrail at the end of a row where the rake is steep*  
to 750 mm to facilitate sightlines provided the width of the barrier  
is also at least 225 mm, so that the aggregate of height plus width  
is never less than 975 mm.  
Where a stepped gangway leads to a balcony front \(and where  
there are no fixed seats\), the guarding must be raised to the full  
guardrail height of 1100 mm for the full width of the gangway; see  
Figure 15.20.  
The top element of a balcony front is sometimes referred to as a  
‘rester rail’. This is a misnomer as balcony fronts should be designed  
such that resting drinks, programmes and other items are not at risk  
of being knocked and falling on people below. The added depth of  
some balcony fronts can be useful for running theatrical communi-  
cations systems and containment for theatrical lighting sometimes  
positioned on balcony fronts to provide front lighting of the stage.  
The narrower, higher guarding of say, a 50 mm diameter rail  
can also be brought closer to the seated audience members in the  
front row to reduce sight line obstructions and avoid audience  
members leaning forward. It is also desirable to allow a toe recess  
for audience members in the front row.

• The fronts of boxes may be treated as balcony fronts.  
• Orchestra pit rails should be treated as balcony fronts.  
• Where there is a drop immediately behind raised seating exceeding 380 mm \(such  
as behind grandstand seating\), a barrier should be provided at least 800 mm high.  
This may be increased to 1100 mm high above the seat level of the rear seat where  
there is a risk of audience members standing on the seat for a better view, such as  
at a rock concert.  
# 3.37 Latecomers  
These should be provided with a waiting area at the rear of the  
auditorium either within the auditorium or in a separate enclosed  
space with viewing panel and sound show relay, or elsewhere with  
a closed-circuit television monitor.  
# 3.38 Attendants  
Legislation dictates the number of attendants present at public  
events, each requiring a seat in the auditorium.  
# 3.39 Adaptability, flexibility and variable formats  
Adaptability can range from modest flexibility in one area to  
wholesale reconfiguration of the space.  
*Orchestra pit and forestage*  
Adapting the orchestra pit and forestage is one of the more com-  
mon forms of adaptability associated with proscenium or end stage  
formats. It can be achieved through mechanised forestage/orchestra  
pit elevators or in the smaller and more economically operated ven-  
ues by the use of movable rostra, from simple demountable systems  
to gas- or spring-loaded units; see Figure 15.21.  
**15.20** *The minimum balcony handrail height is set by legislation at 800* *mm in front of fixed seating and 1100* *mm at the ends of*  
*gangways. Balcony fronts are used to support performance lighting and need socket outlets connected to stage lighting controls\: a\)*  
*Traditional balcony front incorporating shelf below handrail and adequate legroom; b\) Simpler front for side galleries with minimum*  
*clearway allowing the audience to lean on the handrail. The 300 mm clearance should be from the front of the armrest rather than the*  
*base of the tipped-up seat as shown.* **Auditoria 15-17**  
**15.21** *Orchestra pit lifts*  
*Adjustable proscenium*  
To accommodate smaller-scale productions, adjustable prosce-  
nium can be made of non-structural materials to vary the widths  
and heights of the proscenium openings. Sightlines, particularly  
the lateral ones, will need to be checked to the smaller proscenium  
opening.  
*Variable audience capacity*  
Larger venues may need to be able to vary the audience capacity to  
suit different scales of production and where audience demand for  
the show can vary. The simplest way of achieving this may be by  
closing upper tiers or levels through the use of house lighting, using  
curtains and drapes, or more complex solutions such as the lower-  
ing of the ceiling area to fully close off upper levels both visually  
and acoustically. Such arrangements need proper advanced plan-  
ning, including the impact on entrances and exits, through to means  
of escape and impact on front-of-house areas including foyers.  
*Adjustable acoustics*  
The acoustic considerations of spaces for drama use differ consid-  
erably from those used for a natural music acoustic. The spatial  
volume for an auditorium in the order of 10 m3 per seat for sym-  
phonic music drops for musical theatre, amplified music and  
speech. In smaller-scale venues of around 300 seats, such adapt-  
ability is relatively easy to achieve.  
The use of curtains, banners or drapes can assist significantly in  
reducing the reverberation time and also, when required, transform  
the visual outlook of the space. In larger spaces, this can become  
more challenging and require more significant adaptation, such as  
the use of movable ceilings or extensive use of acoustics banners or  
drapes. These can also be masked by screens or located in the space  
above lighting bridges and open ceilings.  
In spaces for drama or where a dry acoustic is required and  
the volume of the space cannot be easily enlarged, an alternative  
approach can be adopted through the use of electronically assisted  
resonance systems which can be integrated into the technical infra-  
structure of the venue to create a longer reverberation time.  
*Variable formats*  
A relatively straightforward example of a variable format may be a  
space where there is a simple need to be able to clear the auditorium  
of seating to provide an open, flat floor space. Layout formats can  
vary, for example, to present different stage and seating relation-  
ships in a drama theatre, which may adapt from an end stage to a  
thrust stage or traverse or even stage in-the-round seating format.  
These variable arrangements tend to suit smaller-scale venues  
where the alternative layouts are carefully planned and associated  
adjustments clearly understood. They may affect the whole or part  
of the auditorium space where, for example, the balconies or upper  
tiers are left unchanged.  
Format change may also refer to larger venues where, for exam-  
ple, a change is required to transform an auditorium from a lyric  
theatre space to a space for music presentation by opening up the  
stage or platform area. These format changes tend to be limited to  
quite specific transformations requiring bespoke solutions.  
# 3.40 Key components of adaptable auditoria  
There are a number of standard component types that enable  
adaptable auditoria spaces apart from the bespoke systems, such  
as movable ceiling systems. These technologies can be separately  
applied or, in some cases, combined to provide effective, transfor-  
mational mechanisms, for example the use of seating wagons and  
elevators to transform seating arrangements in an auditorium.  
A key consideration in making auditoria spaces adaptable is the  
amount of time and workforce required to effect the change against  
the capital cost and flexibility of the mechanisms proposed. Each  
separate seating configuration or room layout will need to comply  
with all safety legislation as if the layout were a permanent fixture.  
Inspections are likely to be undertaken from time to time to ensure  
that all safety procedures are being properly complied with.  
*Loose seating*  
Loose seating arranged on a flat floor is perhaps the simplest way to  
provide flexibility between seating configurations and a cleared flat  
floor. Sightlines will require a higher raised stage area than normal  
and seats will need to be linked in rows or fixed in position. This  
arrangement is relatively labour intensive, while lightweight seats  
which are easy to move and stack are generally less comfortable;  
see Figure 15.22.  
*Retractable seating units*  
Retractable seating units are ideal for spaces where flat floor use is  
required for alternative functions or as movable units for alterna-  
tive seating configurations; see Figure 15.23.  
Sometimes also known as bleacher seating, retractable seating  
units are raked seating systems where each row folds back in on **15-18 Auditoria**  
**15.22** *Loose seating, capable of removal. May or may not have*  
*arms, and be stackable. Needs to be firmly fixed down when in*  
*public use*  
**15.23** *a\) Bleacher seating\: one of a number of proprietary*  
*systems of permanently installed retractable systems. The length*  
*of seating in a single unit is limited to 6 m. For tip-up seats with*  
*arms, the minimum riser height is 250 mm. b\) Bleacher seating*  
*retracted*  
itself like a chest of drawers to create a compact unit to a depth not  
much greater than the depth of a single row and the height of the  
highest row. For units with tip-up seats with arms, the minimum  
riser height is 250 mm to accommodate the seat when folded flat in  
storage mode. More recent developments have now created units  
with gently curving rows.  
Units can be manually or electronically operated and turna-  
round time can be achieved in a matter of minutes.  
*Rostra*  
These are generally made up of demountable, framed structures  
\(not unlike scaffolding systems\) to form floor units that can be  
configured to create raked seating tiers \(where seats are separately  
mounted\), raised stage areas or platforms; see Figures 15.24 and  
15.25\. They are manufactured in steel or lighter weight alumin-  
ium sections. They are highly flexible and can be broken down into  
smaller components for storage, but are labour intensive to set up.  
*Seating wagons*  
These are more complete mobile seating units that can be moved  
around on roller castors or, more efficiently, on air castors to  
form different seating arrangements; see Figure 15.26. They  
require a level, flat and generally well-sealed floor to manoeu-  
vre. Seating wagons allow large seating blocks to be moved out  
of the auditorium, either to an adjacent store, or often to a fore-  
stage elevator to be delivered to dedicated stores below the stalls  
\(see Figure 15.21 earlier\). Seating wagons can also accommo-  
date the same quality, fixed seating as fixed seating in other areas  
of the auditorium.  
*Mobile towers*  
Mobile towers are bespoke, multi-tiered architectural elements  
which contain seating and which can be arranged to suit different  
auditorium formats and dramatically alter the architectural outlook  
and character of the space. Their considerable weight generally  
means that they are moved on air castors or floor tracks.  
**15.24** *Rostra\: a set of metal or timber units built up to form a*  
*stepped floor on a flat base. Seats are secured onto floor or riser.*  
*Each rostrum unit collapsible for storage*  
**15.25** *Proprietary scaffolding-type system*  
**15.26** *Large units on brakeable castors or air cushions*  
*Lifts*  
These are not unlike forestage elevators but extend over a wider  
area of the auditorium floor to provide clear flat floor areas or raised  
seating tiers. These can range from modular floor sections, see  
Figure 15.27, which can be individually or collectively raised using  
scissor lift mechanisms, to large floor plates that can be raised or  
lowered by the use of specialist lift mechanisms, such as screw  
jacks, scissor lifts, chain lifts or spiral lifts. The seating still needs  
to be positioned on top and guardrails applied where changes in  
level are exposed.  
# 3.41 Sound insulation from outside noise sources  
These standards are expressed as Noise Rating \(NR\). To achieve  
the appropriate rating auditorium design may require\:  
• Isolation of the auditorium structurally  
• Sound locks to all doors at point of entry  
• Services acoustically sealed  
• Noise reduction to air conditioning/heating/ventilation system. **15.27** *Floor sections that can be raised and lowered by power*  
*operated systems*  
# 3.42 Ventilation, heating, cooling and air conditioning  
The advent of the Coronavirus epidemic in 2020 and much greater  
environmental and sustainability concerns has led to consider-  
able reappraisal of the most appropriate forms of ventilation for  
large volume spaces, such as an auditorium where relatively large  
numbers of people congregate. New build projects will be able to  
address these issues more directly, but the adaptation of systems in  
historic or existing buildings could be more challenging depend-  
ent on existing ventilation systems, space and the structure of the  
building. Auditoria spaces will typically require large ducts or air  
passages to introduce air into the auditorium and this will occupy  
space that needs to be allowed for. For acoustic and comfort rea-  
sons, the air within the ducts or air passages should typically flow  
at a low velocity.  
The movement of air within auditoria will also need to take  
account of smoke ventilation and containment in the event of fire.  
Please refer to the ABTT Technical Standards \(E3 Smoke ventila-  
tion and containment\) for further guidance.  
The design depends on the internal standards required in the  
auditorium, the thermal insulation of the enclosure and on the  
external climatic conditions. In the UK, an internal design temper-  
ature of 22°C, with a relative humidity of 50 per cent \(RH\) would  
be regarded as an acceptable standard.  
*Cooling*  
Cooling may need to be considered in auditoria spaces that may  
suffer from humidity during warmer months. Air conditioning is  
often misunderstood as a term for providing cooling in an audito-  
rium space. Comfort cooling is a term simply used for cooling the  
incoming air by refrigeration or other means such as thermal mass  
during warm sticky conditions in the summer. In warmer climates,  
pre-cooling may be adopted as a strategy for tempering the internal  
environment before the audience arrives.  
*Ventilation*  
Ventilation needs to provide fresh air at a rate of change to achieve  
comfortable conditions. Statutory regulations set high standards for  
air changes within the auditorium with a minimum air supply per  
occupant of 8 litres per second.  
For reasons of sustainability, this might best be arranged as nat-  
ural or lightly assisted ventilation. It is generally referred to as air  
displacement. The air is introduced at around a couple of degrees  
less than room design temperature of, say 22°C under the seats  
through a grille in the floor under the seat, in the riser of a tier or  
through the seat base. It is introduced at low velocity to avoid drafts  
and air noise and where it is comfortable for audience members and  
then risers to be evacuated at high level.  
# Auditoria 15-19  
Air mixing in an auditorium, which was commonly used as a  
means to stabilise air temperature in high-level forced air ventilation  
systems is not good in respect of infectious disease transmission.  
For this reason, high-level or top air supply and top exhaust extrac-  
tion should now be regarded an unacceptable ventilation solution  
in any theatre or auditorium.  
*Tempered fresh air*  
The advent of the Coronavirus outbreak, as well as seasonal infec-  
tions such as flu or influenza has led to much greater concerns  
about the levels of ventilation in auditoria spaces, such that the  
preference is now towards introducing tempered fresh air rather  
than recirculating air systems. The preferred method is now by the  
supply of tempered air from under the floor and seat using the nat-  
ural buoyancy of air warmed by audience members and rising for  
extraction at high level.  
Acoustic criteria mean that large volumes of air need to be  
delivered at low velocity requiring ducts that have large cross-sec-  
tional area. Integrating these within the auditoria surroundings will  
require careful planning from the outset and can be particularly  
challenging to integrate when upgrading historic venues.  
*Air filtration*  
Improved air filtration systems can render incoming air lower risk  
to infections but will require more fan power to drive the air than  
less effective filters. In new build projects, larger filter areas can  
be arranged, but in existing buildings, increased fan power and  
consequent noise generation may be the only way of reducing the  
possibility to virus intake. It should, however, be noted that as  
external air is sanitised by sunlight the risk level of external air can  
be quite low.  
*Building management systems*  
Heating, cooling and venting for large volume auditoria spaces is  
costly during times when the auditorium is closed and not occupied  
by audiences, for example, during rehearsals or technical fit-ups.  
Control systems such as Building Management Systems \(BMS\)  
and air quality sensors can be used to reduce energy consumption  
to levels appropriate to the occupancy.  
# 3.43 Lighting systems  
Lighting design in auditoria is a highly specialised discipline and  
varies for different auditoria typologies and presentational and  
performance types. Theatre lighting technology is developing and  
expert advice from suitable theatre or performance lighting con-  
sultants should be sought.  
Lighting infrastructure needs to be planned from the outset\:  
where the main electrical supply comes in; the location of distribu-  
tion boards; dimmer rooms for performance lighting; the location  
of control rooms; and the distribution and infrastructure for the per-  
formance lighting in the auditorium and stage house or stage area.  
Digital technology is having a marked impact on the control and  
operation of lighting systems. While technological improvements and  
lifespan of the equipment may last no more than 10 years, the distri-  
bution and wiring infrastructure may be expected to last three times  
as long and, therefore, needs to be carefully considered at the outset.  
Broadly, there are six different requirements for auditorium  
lighting\:  
*Performance lighting*  
This is an integral part of the staging of productions, with lighting  
positions not only on the stage but also within the auditorium at  
ceiling level, on side and rear walls and balcony fronts. Further  
details are given in Section 6.  
For classical music and serious jazz, sufficient lighting for  
the performers to see their music and the conductor \(if any\), and  
for them to be seen by the audience is usually all that is required.  
Similar lighting is required for the platform at conferences. **15-20 Auditoria**  
Pop music requires as complex lighting as for drama and  
opera – although highly sophisticated stage lighting effects have  
become an increasing part of the overall presentation.  
*House lighting before and after performance and during*  
*intervals*  
Illumination is needed to enable the audience to move around,  
find their seats and read programmes with decorative lighting to  
enhance architectural features and shape the overall ambiance of  
the space. Electronic, pre-set scene setting of different lighting lev-  
els, sequences and emphasis allows the house lighting to match the  
mood of the production.  
House lighting for conferences needs to allow for networking  
and reading of notes and programmes.  
*House lighting during performance*  
For cinema, lighting during performance is for exit signs and  
escape routes. For the former, illuminated green legends on a  
black background in a black fitting minimises distraction during  
screenings. For the latter, low-level lights, for example LED lights  
incorporated in the vertical face of step nosings, have advantages in  
not presenting distraction in the line of vision of the screen. A low  
level of illumination is also required within the auditorium to avoid  
the need for the audience to adjust their vision in the event of mains  
failure and a switch to emergency lighting.  
For theatre, a slightly higher level of illumination may be used,  
particularly if the performance demands a contrast with a period of  
almost total darkness. For classical music, it is now usual to have  
sufficient lighting for near-normal vision and following scores.  
Pop music may require house lighting as sophisticated as per-  
formance lighting, with strobe, moving and laser light facilities.  
Certain minimal levels of lighting are required during perfor-  
mances to ensure safety in emergency, particularly along the exit  
routes. Other lighting may be required to come on automatically  
in emergency situations; this may work off a separate protected  
supply. Alternatively, each light fitting can incorporate a battery  
and be programmed to come on when a failure in the mains supply  
is triggered.  
*Working lighting at other times*  
The seating area will also require a brighter working level of light-  
ing for cleaning, maintenance and probably during rehearsals and  
auditions.  
*Front-of-house lighting*  
Escape routes have to be adequately lit at all times during, as well  
as before and after, performances. Foyers, bars and ticket offices  
require creative lighting design to enhance their appeal.  
*Backstage lighting*  
Backstage corridors are often also escape routes for the perform-  
ers and service staff and must be kept illuminated whenever the  
building is occupied. Dressing rooms and workshops will have nor-  
mal lighting for such facilities, and may be fitted with proximity  
detectors to ensure that lights are not left on when the rooms are  
unoccupied. Doors leading to the stage may require special low-  
level blue lighting elements to avoid trip hazards and so that light  
does not spill into the stage area during a performance.

# 4 SEATING  
# 4.1 Introduction  
The aim is to provide an appropriate standard of comfort. While  
the range of human body dimensions is wide, in most auditoria a  
single size of seat is provided in dimensions to suit the average per-  
son; see Figure 15.28 and Table IX. Tolerance levels vary – young  
people can tolerate simple seating found less comfortable by older  
people. Those attending concerts of classical music expect more  
comfort than those watching drama. The best able to be achieved  
is in the order of 90 per cent of the audience within an acceptable  
range of comfort.  
# 4.2 Working dimensions  
• *Seat width* – legislation minimum 500 mm \(with arms\) or  
450 mm \(without\). For seats with arms a width of 525 mm is the  
least for reasonable comfort.  
• *Seat height* – 430–460 mm predominates.  
• *Back inclination* – 10 degrees for upper balconies; 18 degrees  
for stalls.  
• *Seat inclination* – an angle to the horizontal of 7–9°.  
• *Back height* – 800–850 mm above floor level \(may be increased  
for acoustic reasons\).  
• *Back inclination* – angle to the vertical of 15–20°.  
• *Seat depth* – 600–720 mm for seat and back depth overall, reduc-  
ing to 425–500 mm when the seat is tipped up. Depth varies and  
depends on thickness of upholstery and backing and if the rear  
of the seat contains the air conditioning. For a modest seat with  
arms, the dimensions can be as low as 520 mm deep, 340 mm  
when tipped up. The ability of the seat to tip up, activated silently  
by weight when not occupied, allows a clearway \(which is a crit- ical dimension\) to pass along a row while limiting row-to-row  
distance. Where space is severely limited such as in studio thea-  
tres, an especially slim seat, see Figure 15.29, can be used.  
• *Arm rests* – 50 mm minimum width, with the length coinciding  
with the tipped seat to avoid obstructing the clearway. Height  
is about 600 mm above floor level. The upper surface may be  
sloped or not.  
The requirements for cinema seats, including recliner seats and  
sofas in cinemas, can be found in Section 10.4.  
# 4.3 Supports  
The permanent fixing of a seat can be\:  
• Side supports shared by adjacent seats; see Figure 15.30  
• A pedestal or single vertical support; see Figure 15.31  
• Cantilevered brackets fixed to riser \(if of sufficient height\) and  
shared by adjacent seats; see Figure 15.32  
• A bar supporting a group of seats with leg or bracket support;  
see Figure 15.33.  
# 4.4 Other factors  
• *Acoustics* – upholstery should satisfy acoustic requirements,  
usually the level of absorbency when unoccupied, especially the  
case with music; see Figure 15.34.  
• *Ventilation and heating* – for air supply under a seat, allow space  
in floor or riser to receive grille; see Figure 15.35. A plenum  
chamber to deliver low velocity air under the seat is now more  
widely used than direct air ducts if space permits.  
• *Comfort* – upholstery padding should provide comfort and avoid  
fatigue but not encourage excessive relaxation.  
• *Fire* – padding and finish must satisfy fire regulations.  
• *Ease of cleaning* – an important factor in the selection of seat  
fixing details.

# 4.5 Writing surface  
Conference use may require a writing surface for note taking. The  
writing surface may be a\:  
• Tablet fixed to each seat; see Figure 15.36  
• Removable tablet  
• Tablet pivoted to slide away vertically; see Figure 15.37  
• Writing shelf on the back of the row in front, which can be fixed  
in position, hinged or retractable; see Figure 15.38  
• Fixed table with loose seat  
• Fixed table with fixed pivoting or sliding seat; see Figure 15.39.  
Table seating has the advantage that delegates can pass behind the  
row of seats, and assistants can sit behind the delegates.  
In a theatre or concert hall where there is occasional conference  
use, every other row of seats can be used with temporary tables;  
see Figure 15.40.  
**15.39** *Fixed writing surface, individual pivoting seats, section*

These may be required for conference use. They can be incorpo-  
rated into the arm of the seat, see Figure 15.41, or into the rear of  
the seat or table in front. Further details will be found in Section 7.4.  
For music, drama and cinema there may be provision for ear-  
phones for people with hearing impairment, or this facility may be  
provided by an induction loop.

# 5 THEATRES  
# 5.1 Range  
Theatre covers productions of drama, opera, ballet/dance, musi-  
cals, variety and pantomime; see Figure 15.42.  
# 5.2 Types  
Theatre design has developed over many generations in a quest to  
enhance the presentational relationship between the performance  
and the audience. From the traditional proscenium theatre formats  
that dominated theatre design from the seventeenth century until its  
heyday in the latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centu-  
ries, there has since been a gradual erosion of the division between **Auditoria 15-23**  
**15.42** *Relationship diagrams for buildings for opera, musicals, dance and drama. If for drama only, the orchestra pit and musicians’*  
*spaces may not be required\: a\) Where the building serves only touring companies \(a ‘receiving theatre’\) or with a resident company*  
*whose production facilities are elsewhere; b\) Where production facilities are needed \(a ‘producing theatre’\)* **15-24 Auditoria**  
**15.43** *Auditorium formats for opera, dance, and musicals on*  
*proscenium stages\: a\) Horseshoe form, shallow rear and side*  
*balconies; b\) Fan shape with 90° arc, with or without rear*  
*balcony; c\) Shallow rear and side balconies*  
the stage house set behind the proscenium frame to explorations of  
more open formats where the stage occupies the same space as the  
audience.  
The result is a wide variety of theatre forms and presentational  
formats. This has not been a linear development and the traditional  
form of the proscenium stage theatre is still relevant and remains  
the primary format for the presentation of large-scale and elaborate  
scenic effects, such as opera, ballet, music theatre, variety and pan-  
tomime. Figure 15.43 shows various proscenium stage formats for  
such productions.  
# 5.3 Proscenium stage  
*Stage house*  
In proscenium stage theatres, the stage house is separated from the  
auditorium by the proscenium frame opening. The stage house con-  
tains the stage area and the technical machinery for manipulating  
the scenery and stage lighting, while the audience in the auditorium  
views the action on the stage through the frame of the stage open-  
ing. Arranging good sightlines through the proscenium opening  
has determined the arrangement of seating within the auditorium,  
which is essentially end-on, but which has also been developed to  
form more multi-layered arrangements with tiers or boxes further  
wrapping around the auditorium to ‘dress’ or ‘populate’ the side  
elevations of the auditorium.  
The width and dimensions of the proscenium opening are  
important for a number of reasons. The proportion of the framed  
view is somewhat akin to a picture frame, affecting how much of  
the stage area can be seen by the audience. The width and the height  
of the opening also relate to the type and scale of production that  
can be staged \(see Section 7, Table X, which gives an indication of  
the stage size and proscenium openings for different scale theatres\).  
*Orchestra pit*  
The traditional position for the orchestra is located in a pit between  
audience and stage, with the conductor located in a pivotable posi-  
tion controlling the orchestra and singers, while also being able to  
judge the timing or pace of the production on the stage.  
*Forestage and apron stage*  
The proscenium opening is traditionally a structurally framed open-  
ing that is used as the point for separating the fire zones between  
the stage house and auditorium and, where required as part of the  
fire strategy, a large smoke curtain or fire shutter closes the opening  
when not in performance mode. The fire curtain is located imme-  
diately behind the proscenium wall. The back or ‘upstage’ side of  
the fire curtain is also defined as the ‘setting line’ from where the  
layout of stage sets or scenery is set. Forward, or ‘downstage’ of  
this line, any scenery or props would foul the safety curtain.  
The stage area in front or ‘downstage’ of the safety curtain is  
known as the apron stage. Where this stage area is extended to over-  
lap the realms of the stage with the auditorium, this is known as the  
forestage and allows for a more intimate relationship between an  
actor coming downstage into this area and the audience.  
The forestage may also overlap or overhang the orchestra pit  
and is often used for announcers coming in front of the house cur-  
tain to make an announcement.  
# 5.4 End stage  
The end stage is an evolution of the proscenium format but with-  
out the architectural opening, with the audience orientated end-on  
directly in front of the stage, placing the audience and performance  
in the same space. A characteristic of this format is that all four  
corners of the stage can be seen by the audience. It is therefore well  
suited to contemporary dance and forms of physical theatre.  
The stage may or may not have a stage riser and tend to have  
more limited flying facilities for stage scenery, while the audience  
as a unified body generally sits between parallel walls fronting  
the stage. A ‘soft’ or removable proscenium frame can sometimes  
be dropped in where this arrangement is desired for certain produc-  
tions, such as dance, music theatre or opera.  
For dance and opera, the minimum performance area would be  
10 × 10 m \(excluding wings, stage cross over, etc., while for drama  
the stage depth could reduce to 10 × 8 m. Modest wings would be at  
least 3 m deep on either side with masking for storage and scenery  
as well as performers’ entrances and exits \(see Figure 15.56\). In  
medium and larger-scale touring venues, a performance area of 12  
× 12 m would be expected while for large-scale opera and ballet a  
performance area of 15 × 15 m \(see Table X\).  
# 5.5 Open stage formats  
For drama, the initial distinction in formats is between the pro-  
scenium format \(Section 5.3\) and open stage forms. There are a  
number of variations of open stage formats, as shown in Figure  
15.44.  
In certain open stage formats, such as in-the-round or on a thrust  
stage and where there is little possibility of space for scenery or  
sets, the stage floor forms an important part of the stage production.  
It is essential that access can be made to the underside of the stage  
floor and that it be constructed in such a manner that it can be read-  
ily adapted to suit different stage productions. The whole or part  
of the performance area can receive traps as previously described,  
with one ‘grave’ trap 1200 × 2400 mm as a minimum. If there are  
traps, a basement will be needed with access for the performers and  
minimum ceiling height of 4.4 m.  
The stage itself is usually not raised much above the audito-  
rium floor, but can be between 300–750 mm with 600 mm being  
**15.44** *Auditorium formats for drama on open stages\: a\) End*

*Theatre-in-the-round; e\) Transverse\: audience on sides of stage* **Auditoria 15-25**  
a commonly used level. The minimum clear height over the stage  
including scenery suspension grid and stage lighting is 6.5 m.  
An important consideration for open stage formats is how  
performers get onto and off the stage because of the extended  
distance from wings or backstage areas. Typically, in thrust stage  
configurations, the performers might access the stage through the  
audience or by means of vomitory entrances \(see Section 3.26 and  
Figure 15.17\).  
# 5.6 Corner stage \(90° arc\)  
Setting the stage in the corner of the auditorium space creates a  
broadly 90° arc. This arrangement sits somewhere between an end  
stage and amphitheatre with an enhanced degree of encirclement of  
the stage by the audience, allowing the performers to come forward  
for a more engaged relationship with the audience, the walls form-  
ing the back corner of the stage, or with some freestanding scenery  
to create the scenic backdrop to the performance.  
Dimensions for the stage area vary, based on a circle or faceted  
circle, with diameters ranging from 8 to 11 m; see Figure 15.45.  
# 5.7 The wide fan  
Extending the encirclement of the stage by the audience to around  
130° brings forward the concept of the actor’s ‘point of com-  
mand’ \(see Figure 15.14 earlier\), where an actor can command  
the attention of the entire audience arranged in the auditorium in  
front without having to turn his or her head. However, the increas-  
ing degree of encirclement of the stage area, while increasing the  
sense of visual immediacy, can in practice mean the actor’s head is  
sometimes facing away from parts of the audience making it more  
difficult to hear or see the actor’s expression, while sightlines to  
the stage set from the extreme side of the auditorium become more  
challenging.  
# 5.8 Amphitheatres  
The Ancient Greek amphitheatre wrapped the audience around a  
central stage with a 220° encirclement. The steeply raked seating  
was carved into an open-air landscape and focused the seating on  
the open stage ‘orchestra’, while the action took place on a linear  
strip of stage running across the back of the orchestra called the  
‘proscenium’. The backdrop was a permanent, multi-storey, archi-  
tecturally structured, stone façade. Roman arenas fully encircled  
the central stage, but their amphitheatres were semi-circular giv-  
ing a 180° encirclement. Today, amphitheatre is a generically used  
term for outdoor performance spaces.  
# 5.9 Thrust stages  
Thrust stages take the degree of encirclement around three sides  
of an exposed stage area in order to provide a high degree of inti-  
macy between actor and audience. In this case, the audience on  
one side has the audience on the other as part of the backdrop,  
so any scenic devices on the stage are reduced to a few minimal  
props, costumes and the actors themselves. The scenic backdrop  
is otherwise restricted to the fourth side where the audience is not  
seated. Entrances and exits for the actors onto the stage area are  
normally from the scenic fourth side, but as the element of surprise  
can be lost by the distance the actor must travel to the front of the  
stage, alternative entry points through the audience are arranged,  
and in the case of steeply raked seating, may be through vomitory  
entrances.  
For an example of a thrust stage, see Figure 15.46.  
# 5.10 Theatre-in-the-round  
As the name implies, the audience wraps 360° around the stage  
area. It is sometimes also referred to as an arena stage and  
addresses the exposed stage issues associated with thrust stages  
in an even more comprehensive manner. Entrances and exits for  
actors are through the audience, while there is little or no place for  
scenic setting \(save perhaps for the stage floor itself\), which would  
otherwise block the view of audience members on the other side.  
This form of auditoria space is also associated with circus perfor-  
mance, where much of the activity may also be aerial and not just  
on the ground plane.

The performance area can be circular, square, polygon, rectan-  
gular or elliptical; see Figure 15.47. The performers’ entry can be  
combined or separate from the public access.  
# 5.11 Courtyard theatre  
The precedent for these theatre spaces originates from Elizabethan  
theatre spaces where the stage is generally surrounded on three  
sides, not unlike a thrust stage, but where the seating is generally  
raised up on a series of relatively shallow tiers to provide a mul-  
ti-layered auditorium space. In early Shakespearean theatres, such  
as the Rose Theatre or Globe, these spaces were outdoors and open  
to the elements. Audience members stood in the pit around the  
stage, while those in the raised tiers were roofed over to provide  
a greater level of comfort. The close proximity between stage and  
audience provides an intense audience actor relationship.  
The contemporary form of this theatre, which derives from the  
eighteenth-century playhouse in more rectangular-shaped spaces  
and with gently raked seating in the stalls area, has now been  
adopted for a variety of contemporary theatre spaces including The  
Dorfman at the National Theatre in London, the Swan and Royal  
Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. This form also lends  
itself to a range of adaptable theatre spaces.  
# 5.12 Traverse stage  
The traverse stage format arranges the stage as a linear perfor-  
mance platform through the centre of the auditorium and may be  
arranged along either a long or short axis. These arrangements are  
rarely permanently fixed and can be formed as part of an alternative  
staging format in flexible theatre spaces.  
# 5.13 Promenade  
This is not so much a theatre format as a staging configuration  
where the actors are in amongst the audience in a continually  
changing relationship with the audience where the audience is not  
seated but follows the performance through and around the space  
as in site-specific events.  
# 5.14 Multi-purpose and adaptable auditoria spaces  
Adaptable or flexible spaces are not a particular form of theatre,  
but rather those spaces that can be adapted or changed to allow dif-  
ferent performance types or staging configurations. An example of  
a multi-purpose auditorium space, see Figure 15.48, covers a sin-  
gle form with a modest level of flexibility while combining opera,  
dance, musicals and drama, as well as concerts, conference and  
film shows. This is a multi-purpose proscenium stage with flytower  
and a flexible proscenium zone; the seating in the auditorium can  
remain constant. However, problems can arise in combining differ-  
ent types of production in a single auditorium.  
As seen in Section 3.4, the reverberation times for speech and  
music are different and will need addressing between one perfor-  
mance mode and another, as well as adjustments to the performance  
lighting and technical systems.  
Adaptable auditoria spaces might be used for single perfor-  
mance types, such as drama, which can take the form of a courtyard  
theatre or even flat floor space. These are spaces that can be adapted  
to allow thrust stage, end stage, proscenium stage, in-the-round,  
traverse stages or even a catwalk. Each configuration needs to be  
carefully planned and the means by which stage platforms or seat-  
ing areas are formed and arranged must be carefully designed to  
meet all the auditorium design and safety criteria as if the format  
were a set piece. While in theory well-designed spaces can adopt  
multiple staging and seating configurations, in practice, these audi-  
toria spaces are likely to require a large technical crew to effect the  
change, time to carry out the change and a significant storage space  
to accept the various parts to enable each configuration to work  
safely and effectively.  
# 5.15 Studio theatres  
Studio theatres, sometimes referred to as ‘black box’ theatres, by  
definition do not contain moving stage machinery. They usually  
have some form of mobile or movable seating either to provide  
for different layouts or to clear the space for other uses at different  
times.  
There are a number of well-developed, flexible seating systems  
offering great variety and compliance with normal seating regu-  
lations, with a foldaway and mobile facility. However, bleacher  
seating systems demand a dedicated space into which the seating  
can be concertinaed when not in use. There is a significant point  
load factor under the supporting wheels. Bleacher seating arrange-  
ments do not offer flexible seating layout possibilities.  
*Access*  
Studio theatres should have different access points for entries and  
exits, allowing flexibility for both the audience and performer.  
A passage around the outside of the studio allows performers to  
access any entrance. In all cases, it is assumed that audience circu-  
lation and amenities are located adjacent to designated exits, which  
should have immediate access to further doors on the outer side of  
the passage leading to a place of safety. Provision for drapes to be  
hung and moved around the walls offers the potential for varying  
the acoustic as well as the outlook of the space. Traditionally, these  
spaces had black walls and drapes to determine the ‘neutrality’ of  
the space, but this does not need to be a given.  
Height is a key factor.  
*Lighting grid*  
One of the great selling points for the studio theatre is the speed  
and ease with which one can move from one production to  
another. Frequently this is serviced by having a grid made up of  
50 mm outside diameter tubing over the whole space from which  
performance light fittings can be hung in any location. If space and  
cost allow, it is a considerable advantage if this can be arranged  
in such a way that there are technical gantries that allow access  
to lighting bars to effect all the lighting changes without the use  
of access equipment and ladders, thereby allowing for completely  
different functions to be carried out at floor level simultaneously.  
An alternative is a tension wire grid, which allows full, safe access  
to performance lighting over the whole area. If a technical gan-  
try is not possible then it is essential that the lighting grid can be **Auditoria 15-27**

accessed from below by a mobile access system. From a theatre  
lighting perspective, the head of the lantern should not be less than  
4 m above floor level.  
# 6 LIGHTING AND SOUND  
# 6.1 Introduction  
Auditorium lighting and sound will have a considerable impact  
on the design of the auditorium space and therefore needs to be  
considered at an early stage in the planning process. If good and  
workable positions for rigging sound and lighting equipment are  
not considered part of the auditorium design, theatre technicians  
will in due course rig their own positions, which could well look  
unsightly. Integration of technical equipment can be relatively  
straightforward in an open stage or studio space where the equip-  
ment and technical infrastructure form part of the auditorium  
aesthetic. Where this is not the case, greater care will be needed to  
conceal equipment in the appropriate positions. **15-28 Auditoria**  
Lighting requirements within the auditorium include side light-  
ing positions, the advance bar or lighting bridge, lighting bridges,  
tension wire grids, slips or side bridges and follow spot platforms.  
These are all located at high level within the auditorium. At lower  
level within the auditorium, front lighting of the stage is often  
required and hung on lighting bars located on the circle front or  
bars positioned discreetly under tiers.  
Rigging for sound systems within the auditorium may include  
vertically mounted booms each side of the proscenium or a central  
cluster of speakers over the stage in front of the proscenium and  
delay speakers under the balcony.  
# 6.2 Positioning of performance lighting and sound  
The position of technical equipment is governed by ease of access.  
In intensively used auditoria, staff will require almost daily access  
to lighting and equipment and safe access must be provided in order  
for them to carry out their functions. Access needs to be to the rear  
of the lantern with ample room for the staff to reach around to the  
front of the fitting and also sufficient free space for the equipment  
to be readily demountable should repair be required.  
Over a third of the total number of theatre lighting instru-  
ments in a modern rig are likely to be located in the auditorium  
area \(front-of-house\); see Figure 15.49. Lighting the actor’s face  
at around 45° above the horizontal is essential to avoid unflattering  
shadows, while a lower angle may cast unwanted shadows on the  
set. Stage lighting needs to be considered in 3D as spotlights are  
rarely directed straight at an actor’s face and more normally by  
means of cross lighting. This means that lighting angles may be set  
at 55° in order to achieve 45° when crossed.  
Depending on auditorium design, lanterns are either housed on  
bridges, which reach across the auditorium, see Figure 15.50, or are  
attached to the auditorium structure itself. Lighting bridges require  
thoughtful integration into the ceiling design of the auditorium,  
especially where the layout of the bridges needs to be integrated  
with the ceiling design.  
**15.49** *Method of locating theoretical positions of spotlights. Spots*  
*at A will light a performer at stage edge at 55° in section, about*  
*45° to 50° after crossing, but as the performer moves in from the*  
*edge the angle decreases. At Q it is only 40° in section, about 35°*  
*after crossing and this is the minimum. Another lighting position*  
*B must be provided to cover the area Q to R within the same*  
*range of angles, and then C and D to light areas R to S and S to T*  
**15.50** *Auditorium lighting bridge at ceiling level* Provision for performance lighting in the auditorium on each  
side of the proscenium opening mounted on vertically arranged  
lighting booms is generally also required. Lighting design for thea-  
tre-in-the-round is particularly complex, as the need is to illuminate  
the performance without undue glare falling in the eyes of the audi-  
ence opposite; see Figure 15.51.  
*Follow spots*  
Follow spots form an integral part of much musical, ballet and operatic  
work. Traditionally, a follow spot operator directs a narrowly focused,  
movable beam onto one or more performers during the course of the  
performance following the performer as required see Figure 15.52.  
**15.51** *On thrust and theatre-in-the-round stages virtually all the*  
*lighting comes from overhead to avoid glare in the eyes of the*  
*audience\: a\) Plan; b\) Section*  
**15.52** *Follow spot, minimum size for equipment and operator*  
*1.5 × 2 m*  
# Auditoria 15-29  
Typically, follow spots are large and require in the order of 2 m2  
of space for the lantern and operator located high up behind or over  
the audience seating. The follow spot positions should therefore  
allow for lanterns to swing and the operator to stand either behind  
or beside the instrument.  
Account should be taken of the considerable weight of moving  
follow spot lanterns into position and the need access to the lens for  
cleaning. Sometimes, these positions may be located amongst the  
rear audience seating where areas are sectioned off to accommo-  
date the follow spot for productions where they are needed. Current  
technology now allows more remote control of follow spots to  
overcome some of the constraints of positioning follow spot in dif-  
ficult or inaccessible locations.  
The angle of the position to the stage should be around 45° or  
more, because the whole point of follow spotting is to isolate what is  
being lit in this way. Normally, a pair of follow spots is located in a  
high central position to allow individual operators easy contact with  
each other, especially if they are separated by glass from the audito-  
rium area. Provision should be considered for two further spotlight  
positions, either side of the auditorium, at a similarly high angle. The  
follow spots should be able to cover the whole of the performing area.  
# 6.3 Spaces associated with the audience area  
*Lighting control position*  
The lighting control position or room is ideally situated on the centre  
line of the auditorium, fully enclosed and soundproofed with a win-  
dow and space for the lighting control console and for the operator  
who needs a clear view over the console to the performance with an  
unrestricted view of the stage; see Figure 15.53. The control room  
window should be openable and non-reflective, with sightlines over  
the audience seating and where someone standing in front of the  
control room will not obstruct views. There should also be space for  
an assistant and a worktop for plans and scripts. The advent of digi-  
tal technology has meant that lighting control systems are becoming  
ever smaller and can now be controlled from a laptop in smaller  
venues. A minimum recommended size for a lighting control room  
would be 3 m wide, 3.5 m deep and 2.5 m high.  
*Dimmer rooms*  
Space is required for the dimmer racks, which are the direct means  
of control for all of the stage lighting equipment. The racks also  
contain the individual fusing for each stage lighting circuit. Mains  
cabling runs from the dimmer room to all outlets of the stage light-  
ing installation, and also to the house lights, but the connection  
between the dimmer racks and the lighting control itself is not a  
mains voltage line.  
The dimmer room should be placed so that quick access may  
be achieved either from the lighting control position or from the  
stage area. The dimmer room will also normally contain the mains  
isolation for the stage lighting system. In large venues which have a  
three-phase supply, each single-phase installation should be phys-  
ically separated.  
*Audiovisual \(AV\) rack room*  
Space will also be required for the AV racks, either as a stand-alone  
facility or combined within the dimmer room.  
*Sound control positions*  
The sound control room needs to be centrally located within the  
auditorium in an open enclosure, where the operator has an unin-  
terrupted view of the performance area as well as being able to  
hear the performance. The room contains a control desk, equipment  
racks, monitor loudspeakers and worktop for scripts. The minimum  
size is 3 m wide, 4.4 m deep and 3 m high.  
*Auditorium sound-mixing position*  
This is for the mixing of amplified sound from the stage by an  
operator who needs to hear the same sound as the audience. The **15-30 Auditoria**  
**15.53** *Control room with direct view of the stage\: a\) Section; b\) Vertical sightlines*  
area needs to be flat and set within the seating area\: minimum area  
of 2 × 2 m, but may be significantly larger, to accommodate the  
sound-mixing desk and protective surrounding barriers. In a tour-  
ing venue/receiving house, the large and heavy mixing desk and  
other equipment may be changed over with each visiting show, so  
access to these positions will need some thought. Fixed seats can  
get damaged when the equipment is carried over them; removable  
seats need time to detach, remove and replace again \(as well as  
needing space for the storage of removed seats\).  
*TV, radio and recording control room*  
This is a separate soundproof control room, with a viewing window  
into the auditorium and clear view of the stage. It will accommo-  
date announcers and staff for balancing and directing transmissions  
and recording. A minimum area of 2 × 2 m is required, but should  
be larger.  
*Observation room*  
Those associated with production may need to check the show  
being performed on the stage from a room at the rear of the audi-  
torium, with a clear view of the stage through an observation  
window, minimum area, 2 × 2 m.  
# 7 STAGE HOUSE  
# 7.1 Introduction  
The stage house is a highly technical area of the theatre that has been  
transformed in recent years by digital technology and sophisticated  
communication and control systems. Continuing technological  
development and improved safe working practices mean that the  
input of suitably qualified theatre consultants to advise on the  
design and operation of these areas is essential.  
The stage house refers to\:  
• The main performance area  
• Flytower  
• Wings on each side of the stage  
• Side and rear stages \(if provided\).  
The stage house of a proscenium stage theatre is about the set-  
ting up and changing of scenery and lighting and must be made as  
easy and as flexible as possible. Scenery may be moved during a  
performance to make way for a new production. The movement  
of sets or scenery and lighting can be horizontal into the wings on  
either side or into a rear stage. It can also be vertical up into the  
flytower or vertical down into a stage basement. **Auditoria 15-31**  
Space at stage level and in and around the surrounding areas  
is at a premium, so very careful planning is needed to ensure the  
whole area is as operationally efficient as possible.

*The wings*  
In most normal theatres, the wings on either side of the stage are  
Circulalion  
the easiest place to move scenery, so these areas are important. The

wing spaces need to accommodate prop tables and quick change

areas for when there is insufficient time for a performer to reach the  
dressing rooms to change costume during a show. For some pro-  
ductions, such as dance or ballet, the wings will also provide clear  
space on both sides of the stage for dancers to run off the stage at  
speed without colliding with a wall or piece of equipment. Where  
there is a flytower over the stage, the amount of wing space will be

affected by the choice of flying system. A minimum depth for the  
wings should be 4 m.  
**15.54** *Stage layout and dimensions for a medium-size theatre*  
*without flytower*  
# 7.2 Proscenium stage without flytower  
For smaller auditorium spaces without a flytower, simpler sus-  
pension systems for the suspension of scenery, curtains, pelmets,  
borders and lighting barrels above the stage, see Figure 15.54, will  
be required. Suspension lines can be fitted to pulleys or blocks  
mounted in a limited height grid, which enables certain forms of  
flying from a side gallery above the stage or from the stage level.  
Side stages are required for stacking spaces for flats, properties and  
rostra, as well as circulation routes within the stage area, particu-  
larly for use as a stage crossover at the rear of the stage.  
*Raised stage*  
The height of the stage can be between 600 mm and 1100 mm with  
a straight, angled or curved front edge to the stage. The floor to the  
performance area, in part or total, may be constructed as a series of  
modular traps, typically in 1200 mm square panels, which can be  
removed selectively.  
# 7.3 Proscenium stage with flytower  
The dimensions and shape of the performance area are deter-  
mined by the recommended proscenium opening as in Table X.  
A wider opening can be reduced by soft masking or curtains, so  
that an all-purpose stage should be sized for the largest production.  
Ideally, the depth of the performance area from front to rear should  
be equal to the proscenium opening.  
*Side and rear stages*  
The side and rear stage areas should relate to the size of the per-  
formance area. These areas may need to hold sets of the same size  
and scale as used in the performance area, with clear circulation  
space all round. The clear height of side and rear stage areas should  
be as high as the highest scenery that might be needed plus 1 m  
clearance.

*Safety curtain*  
Historically, the stage area has been regarded as a high fire risk  
area and the practice of separating the stage house from the rest  
of the theatre by use of a fire safety curtain has been a strategy  
that is becoming less relevant today dependent on the fire strategy  
adopted for the venue. The normal form of a fire safety curtain  
is a rigid fire resisting shutter suspended immediately behind the  
proscenium opening and dropping on the stage from the flytower;  
see Figure 15.55. The fire seal must continue below stage level and  
around the overlap with the orchestra pit.  
Examples of existing flytower stages are shown in Figures  
15.56, 15.57, 15.58.  
# 7.4 Stage machinery  
Large dedicated buildings such as opera houses are equipped with  
highly engineered and sophisticated stage machinery to facilitate  
the manipulation of a wide variety of scenic effects.  
*Bridges*  
These are long lifts which span the width of the proscenium  
opening, giving a rise and fall facility over the main acting area.  
Typically, they are driven by screw jacks, scissor lifts, spiral lifts,  
chain hoists, hydraulic systems or other heavy lifting equipment.  
*Revolving stages*  
These need to be set into the stage floor to provide a flush sur-  
face with the surrounding stage floor, but this can sometimes be  
arranged to coincide with the system of lifts and bridges.  
*Wagon stages*  
These are large pallets capable of taking an entire stage set, which  
may be moved into place behind the proscenium fully constructed,  
thereby saving time and labour during the performance turnaround  
period. If wagon stages are used, sound generated in off-stage areas  
needs to be isolated from the main stage area. Depending on the  
flying configuration, up to three stage wagon positions \(left, right  
and upstage\) may be held in off-stage areas for immediate deploy-  
ment. It is also possible to mount revolves into wagon stages to be  
brought into use when required for particular productions. Much  
larger theatrical installations have even extended the wagon princi-  
ple so that they are used as a system of gigantic palletised storage to  
store up to a dozen or more sets fully erected in large spaces below  
the stage, with provision being made to have them lowered below  
the stage surface on large stage elevators.

# 7.5 Flytower  
The flytower allows full height stage scenery and lighting bars to  
be raised or ‘flown’ out of view into the tower above the stage.  
With traditional rope sets or winches operated by hand from a gal-  
lery well above the stage level, the load of the scenery is directly  
suspended and so there is no reason for counterweights to obstruct  
the full width of the wings. In counterweight systems, the load of  
the scenery is counterbalanced by weights to relieve the direct load  
needed to move scenery and lights up and down.  
It is essential that the means of suspension can be lowered to the  
stage floor. Depending on the frequency of usage, this suspension  
system can either be winched, or in smaller installations be operated  
using rope hand lines. In the theatre, all items suspended overhead  
are ‘flown’. The space above the stage is referred to as the ‘flies’.  
The greater the height over the stage is usually considered better,  
offering greater flexibility for designers both of scenic and lighting  
disciplines. Where the scenic suspension system is raised consider-  
ably above the stage, it can then be described as a flytower.  
Conventionally, the clear height of the flytower was 2½ times  
the proscenium height. Nowadays greater heights are usually  
demanded, with a minimum of 2½ times the proscenium height to  
the underside of the grid and a clear 2 m above the grid.  
There are two main means of suspension – counterweight and  
powered systems.  
*Counterweight systems*  
Counterweight flying systems have largely replaced ropes and hand  
winches in larger theatres. The load on a flying bar is counterbal-  
anced by weights located in a cradle running vertically in guides  
on the side wall of the stage house. It is usual to only install cradles  
on one side of the stage, thereby freeing up the other side for stage-  
level access.  
There are two types of counterweight system\:  
• Single-purchase counterweights where the travel distance is  
equal to the height of the grid above the stage\: a continuous ver- tical wall running higher than the grid is required for the guides;  
see Figure 15.59.  
• Double-purchase counterweights where the distance travelled by  
the counterweights is halved in relation to the distance of the  
suspension; see Figure 15.60. This allows the operation to occur  
from a gallery above the stage level\: an extra loading gallery  
is necessary between the flying gallery and grid. In mechanical  
terms, double-purchase systems are less efficient than sin-  
gle-purchase, but allow wing space at stage level to be clear of  
the counterweight systems.  
*Power flying systems*  
These are becoming increasingly affordable in the modern theatre  
and obviate the need for space for the cradles at stage level by con-  
taining the entire system at the very highest point in the building,  
opening up the possibility of side stages on either side.  
It is important to locate flyfloors either side of the flytower to  
provide horizontal access above the nominal height of the scen-  
ery. These are used by technicians to locate and control horizontal  
movement of vertically suspended components. If the building is  
likely to have dedicated usage by a single-occupancy user, then  
certain suspension positions may be dedicated for lighting systems,

**15.61** *Cross-section showing rear stage*  
in which case a special provision may be made for horizontal access  
by personnel to reach these positions as well as their lowering and  
raising facilities. It will also be possible to feed the necessary elec-  
trical supply from directly above the position in a self-monitoring  
system, which caters for the vertical movement. Figure 15.61  
shows a flytower stage with a rear stage.  
The grid above the stage from where the suspensions come  
should provide clear walking space above for personnel to move  
about over the floor area. The received wisdom is to place the pul-  
leys supporting the suspension bridge at the high point with the  
walking grid space below it. The key to overhead suspension is the  
load and the frequency of suspension points. Multi-use, intensively  
used venues will have bars suspended every 200 mm with load  
capacity up to 500 kgf per bar. Less intensively used installations  
may have bars 300 mm apart and, depending on the nature of the  
performance to be given, the load capacity may come down to 350  
kgf per bar.  
An automatic smoke vent is required at the top of the flytower\:  
regulations require the cross-sectional area of the vent to be a par-  
ticular proportion of the stage – usually 10 per cent. Alternatively,  
fire-rated mechanical ventilation can also be used.  
# 7.6 Orchestra pit  
A basic requirement of the orchestra pit is the ability of the con-  
ductor to be seen both by the singers and dancers on the stage, and  
by the musicians in the pit. In turn, the conductor needs to be able  
to judge the timing of the production on the stage in order to pace  
the musical accompaniment, so his or her eye level should be no  
lower than the stage floor. For the audience, the requirement is for a  
balanced sound level from the orchestra to match the performance  
on the stage.  
An orchestra pit for a large opera house may need to accom-  
modate up to 120 musicians, while pits in historic theatres may  
accommodate in the order of 60–70 players. In contemporary the-  
atres designed, for example, for musical theatre or contemporary  
dance, the need may be to accommodate no more than 10–12 people.  
Sound levels for musicians playing within an orchestra pit can  
be extremely high and in excess of 80 dBs, so there is concern over  
preventing hearing damage. Spatial standards and the design of  
orchestra pits need to balance the often limited space available with  
the need for musicians to be able to perform effectively. There are  
many factors that conflict\: increasing space between musicians and  
sound screens versus close proximity needed for ensemble play-  
ing; more musicians forward of the stage front versus their sound  
swamping the singers on the stage; greater depth under the stage for  
sound dissipation versus sightlines to the conductor. It is no longer  
acceptable to leave the design of the pit to chance. As a general  
guide, an allowance of 1.7 m2 should be provided for musicians in **15-34 Auditoria**  
open space and up to 2.8 m2 in enclosed areas, 5 m2 for a piano and  
up to 10 m2 for tympani and percussion. Around 4 m2 should be  
allowed for the conductor. To minimise the gulf between stage and  
audience, the pit can extend under the stage front for a distance that  
is ideally no greater than 2 m.  
In opera houses, the pit is generally a fixed feature. In other the-  
atres, where drama and other performance types are programmed,  
the pit can act as a gulf breaking down the actor – audience rela-  
tionship, so there is benefit in having some form of adaptability  
in the pit zone. Such adaptability can be arranged through the use  
of forestage elevators or more rudimentary means where elevators  
cannot be afforded. See *Orchestra pit and forestage*, section 3.39  
These can provide\:  
• A fore stage when elevated  
• Two or three extra rows of seating when level with the audito-  
rium floor  
• An orchestra pit when in the down position.  
See also Figure 15.21 earlier.  
*Stage manager’s desk*  
This is traditionally located stage left \(facing the audience\) and is pro-  
vided as a communications and control position for the stage manager,  
which includes public address, safety curtain and/or drencher release,  
flytower vent release and communication with lighting and sound  
technicians, fly gallery, conductor, etc. as well as cueing performers.  
*Stage manager’s office*  
The stage manager needs a small office in the immediate vicinity of  
the stage where he or she can manage the technical administration  
of the theatre.  
# 7.8 Spaces for actors, singers and dancers  
• *Dressing rooms*\: arrangements are illustrated in Figures 15.62 to  
15.70 covering single shared and communal occupancy rooms  
• *Green room with kitchen and server*\: 3.4 m2 per occupant  
• *Laundry for repair and maintenance of costumes*\: 20 m2 minimum  
• *Costume store, including skips and rails*  
• *Costume delivery*  
• *Specialist make-up room*\: 10 m2 minimum per person  
• *Pre-performance practice room\(s\) \(singers\)*\: 15 m2 minimum  
• *Pre-performance dance studio \(dancers\)*\: 1000 m2 minimum  
• *Physiotherapy room \(dancers\)*\: 15 m2 minimum  
• *Wig store and hairdresser’s room*\: 5–10 m2  
• *Waiting area* for visitors and dressers  
• *Offices*\: children’s supervisor, company manager, touring man-  
ager, etc. 10 m2 minimum per office  
• *Toilets*  
• *Performers’ assembly areas*\: at points of entry to stage.  
# 7.7 Stage-related spaces  
*Quick change*  
Separate rooms immediately off the stage may be required, each  
with two make-up positions and hanging rails. Where this is not  
possible, separate temporary cubicles may be set up in the wings or  
an alternative space used for quick changes.  
*Properties room*  
This is a store room, opening directly off a side stage for properties  
for use during a performance. It requires a sink with hot and cold  
running water.  
*Scene dock*  
This should be at the same level as the stage for storage of scenery.  
*Loading bay or get-in*  
A loading bay or *get-in* is needed for the delivery of scenery and  
properties into the scene dock. Allow for more than one pantechni-  
con to reverse up to the loading. A weather cover can be desirable  
during inclement weather, while some means of preventing the  
warmth from the stage area escaping to the outside during winter  
months should also be considered.  
In city centre locations, the loading bay may need to be fully  
enclosed with sound insulation, as get-ins and get-outs can take  
place during unsocial hours. However, this is often difficult to  
incorporate with turning circles for large vehicles and operating  
space to the sides for opening truck or container doors.  
*Scenery*  
A repair and maintenance area for scenery located near the stage  
is desirable to maintain scenery and properties in use on the stage.  
*Piano store*  
Grand pianos are delicate instruments, which should be provided  
with a suitable store when not in use. A separate room kept at a  
temperature similar to stage conditions should be provided – a min-  
imum area 4.5 × 3.5 m is required.  
*Lighting and electrical equipment store*  
An electrical equipment store is required with direct access off the  
wing space for the storing of lanterns, leads and electrical equip-  
ment. Lanterns can sometimes be stored at high level in areas off  
the lighting bridges.  
*Sound equipment*  
Storage and maintenance space is required for such items as micro-  
phones, speakers, stands, etc.

# 8 CONCERT HALLS  
# 8.1 Introduction  
Concert halls provide an auditoria space specifically for practice  
and performance of classical music including symphonic concerts,  
chamber music and recitals. Most concert halls also accommodate  
a wider range of amplified and contemporary music. Concert halls  
typically seat audiences of 1500 to 2000. Audience size is at an  
optimum at around 1800 seats, beyond which acoustic excellence  
becomes more difficult to achieve. Recital halls are used for  
smaller-scale performance of classical music, typically to audi-  
ences of 200 to 600.  
There are two broad approaches to the design of concert halls  
and include the shoebox form and the vineyard form. The vine-  
yard form is typified by the Berlin Philharmonie, designed by Hans  
Scharoun and completed in 1963. The shoebox form is the more  
widely adopted. The double cube proportion of the space provides  
good lateral surfaces for strong sound reflection and spatial artic-  
ulation of the musical instruments, which enhances the listening  
experience.  
# 8.2 Layout  
The general layout configurations are shown in Figure 15.71. For  
orchestral and choral classical music in concert hall or recital room  
there are three broad categories of relationships between audience  
and platform; see Figure 15.72a–c\:  
• Audience focused towards the orchestra and choir on the plat-  
form, with or without choir stalls, in a single direction; see  
Figure 15.72a  
**15.71** *Relationship diagram for buildings for orchestral and choral classical music with choir stalls, and for jazz and pop/rock music*  
*without choir stalls* • Audience on three sides semi-surrounding the platform; see  
Figure 15.72b  
• Audience surrounding the platform; see Figure 15.72c.  
Types of single-direction relationship include the rectangular box  
as in the diagrams shown and variations on the rectangular box.  
The rectangular box is a simple well-established form. It allows full  
cross-reflection of audience, is central to the platform and receives  
a good sound balance. The fan-shaped auditorium is a particular  
variation on the rectangular box but suffers from the lack of side-  
and cross-reflection. Other shapes include elliptical spaces. These  
should be avoided, as concave shapes within the auditorium tend  
to focus sound creating unbalanced and unwanted concentrations  
of sound.  
# 8.3 Acoustic design considerations  
It is important that every member of the audience hears the per-  
formance clearly without colouration and that the performers can  
hear each other to enable them to play as an ensemble. The acous-  
tic dimension of a space is determined by the relative differences  
between the direct sound path and reflected sound. Acoustically  
reflective surfaces in the appropriate locations and distances from  
both musicians and audience are necessary to disperse and generate  
the sound heard.  
The volume of the room has a direct bearing on the reverbera-  
tion time and it is important that this is established at the outset with  
suitably qualified acoustic consultants. For music, the reverbera-  
tion time should be in the order of two seconds. Clarity of sound  
needed for speech intelligibility is less important than reverberance  
and envelopment of sound. As an initial guide, the volume of the  
room should be in the order of 10 m3 per audience member.  
# 8.4 Seating arrangements  
While it is important that members of the audience can see the  
musicians on the platform, in contrast to seating for drama, steeper  
rakes tend to absorb too much sound energy. Shallow rakes that  
allow the sound path to graze the heads of the audience tend to  
provide a better result in auditoria for music. Auditorium spaces  
for music, in contrast to drama theatres, should enjoy a sense of  
space, openness and even natural daylight illuminating the space.  
This can also be helped by the use of more comfortable seating,  
which should be as acoustically neutral as possible whether occu-  
pied or not and more space allowed between the front row and the  
platform.  
# 8.5 Platform design  
The music components include orchestra platform, choir stalls and  
organ; see Figure 15.73.  
Platform design relates to orchestra size\:  
• Symphony orchestra and choir  
• Symphony orchestra, 80–120 musicians  
• Chamber orchestra, 40–50 musicians  
• Small ensemble.  
**15.72** *Relationships between audience and platform in various*  
*rectangular formats\: a\) Single direction; b\) Audience partially*  
*surrounding the platform; c\) Audience surrounding the platform.*  
*With or without rear and side balconies*  
# Auditoria 15-37  
**15.73** *Components of the platform for classical music*  
The traditional layout of the orchestra prescribes a broadly  
semi-circular form with, facing the audience, the violins, violas and  
smaller stringed instrument sections arranged on the left, the larger  
stringed sections comprising cellos and bass on the right and the  
woodwind section located mid-centre. Progressing towards the rear  
are the brass sections and then percussion and timpani at the back,  
the strength of sound from each section determining their position  
on the platform.  
For larger orchestras, a series of tiered steps at the rear of the  
platform raises the rear sections of the orchestra to increase visibil-  
ity and sound projection. When the orchestra with all its members is  
laid out in plan, the width of the orchestra is the critical dimension  
that must be provided to accommodate the orchestra on the plat-  
form, while the depth might be around one-half times the radius.  
Thus, larger orchestras will require a proportionately wider plat-  
form, which can be up 18 m for a full-scale symphonic orchestra  
of 120 players.  
By following the accepted principle for laying out an orchestra  
and the number of musicians to be included, this will determine the  
width of the platform and hence the minimum width of the audi-  
torium.  
For a chamber orchestra, the platform can be 8 m deep, 12 m  
wide; for a full orchestra an area of 18 × 12 m. Various configura-  
tions are shown in Figure 15.74 and a section in Figure 15.75.  
# 8.6 Areas for individual musicians  
• Violin players and small wind instruments\: 1200 × 750 mm  
• Cellos and bass\: 1500 × 1000 mm  
• Horns and bassoons\: 1000 × 800 mm  
• Trombones and large brass instruments\: 1350 × 1000 mm.  
These dimensions include music stands, but on a tiered riser, addi-  
tional space should be allowed for to provide a safe margin\:  
• Strings, brass, and woodwind players, including cellos and dou-  
ble base\: 1500 mm tiers  
• Percussion\: up to 2 m tiers  
• Concert grand piano\: 2.75 × 1.6 m tiers  
• Choir\: 0.38 m2 minimum per singer in choir stalls with bench  
seats, although when not used by the choir, these seats may be  
sold as audience seats and more space should be allowed. The  
longitudinal section can be flat and stepped transversely, rising  
from the conductor’s rostrum. **15-38 Auditoria**

# 9.1 Introduction  
The conference industry is adapting to a world of ever-greater con-  
nectivity and technological facility. Branding and more individual  
presentational styles are playing increasingly significant roles, and  
the ability of the venue to be able to present itself accordingly for  
each event is becoming more important, particularly in the com-  
mercial sector.  
Front-of-house areas need to be able to greet conference mem-  
bers and delegates, have space for registration and badging, issue  
programmes and conference packs, have space for exhibitions  
and presentational material of sponsors and promoters, be able to  
deposit coats and bags, to use the toilets, provide refreshment and  
circulation areas for members to be able to assemble and network,  
all before going into the conference hall.  
Conferences are often broken into a series of sessions inter-  
spersed throughout a day with more refreshment during breaks, as  
well as meals during lunch breaks. The duration of conferences  
generally extends over a longer time period during the day \(and  
evenings\) and may need to accommodate people coming and going  
throughout the period. Breakout spaces for separate sessions and  
smaller group meetings are often also needed. Staff areas will  
need to be equipped with space for laptops or computers, print-  
ers, telephones, etc., while filming or recording and transmitting  
of conference events is becoming a more common part of many  
larger-scale events.  
# 9.2 Formats  
Conference halls are designed for speech where audience members  
are also able to communicate openly with speakers or presenters on  
the platform. Speech and communication are generally supported  
by amplified sound and AV aids, with presentation from a laptop or  
tablet computer. The platform on which speakers are located gener-  
ally shares the same space as the audience, although other auditoria  
spaces may be adapted to suit.  
Formats depend on use\:  
• *Traditional lecture theatre formats*\: The audience is focused  
towards a platform on which there is provision for a speaker  
or speakers, possibly served by a range of AV aids; see Figure  
15.76\. The speaker is the controlling point with the audience  
in a receptive role. Video projection, white boards and other  
presentation/communication formats tend to limit the extent of  
encirclement of the platform, although multiple screens angled  
towards all parts of the audience can compensate.  
• *Debating formats*\: Participation by each member of the audi-  
ence suggests the debating formats of semi-circle, U*-*shape and  
circle, controlled by a chairperson, see Figure 15.77. Video  
recording and live projection of speakers and participants onto  
large screens or monitors is increasingly used to allow partic-  
ipants to be viewed in greater detail to a wider audience. The  
need for equal distribution and viewing of all delegates’ facial  
expressions is important, particularly in political formats, so  
that delegates can be aware of the spoken contribution of each.  
Public viewing galleries for non-participants can be provided.

*with or without rear balcony*  
# Auditoria 15-39  
**15.77** *Conference hall formats for debating\: a\) Fan with 180°*  
*arc \(US Senate\); b\) Audience in two facing banks \(House of*  
*Commons\)*  
The plan shape of the conference hall can be\:  
• Rectangular  
• Fan-shaped, with angles of 135°, 90° or 60° \(the last is best for  
screening\)  
• Hexagonal  
• Circular  
• Oval  
• Coffin.  
# 9.3 Functional requirements  
With the lecture format, functional requirements include\:  
• The audience needs to see and hear the speaker, chairperson and  
panel of speakers in the various positions on the platform  
• They need a clear view of screens and other visual displays  
• Acoustic clarity of sound listening to speaker and reproduced  
through speaker systems  
• Ability to view presentations and any demonstrations.  
Debating format functional requirements include\:  
• Awareness of the whole audience by every member  
• The audience able to hear all speakers and chairperson  
• A clear view of the chairperson and, ideally, to be able to see  
each member speaking, which can be assisted by AV means  
• An example of a facility used only for lecturing is shown in  
Figure 15.78.  
# 9.4 Seating design  
Seating design for conference use is covered in Section 4, Seating.  
# 9.5 Technical requirements  
The technical infrastructure needs to be able to accommodate the  
regular updates in the technology used in the presentation of con-  
ferences, lectures and events. Satellite communication systems and  
live digital broadcasting, for example, is becoming an important  
part of major events.  
To take advantage of lucrative commercial opportunities, the  
following services must be available.  
*Adjustable lighting*  
In conferences and events, good lighting levels are needed so that  
delegates and users can read conference material as well as being  
able to see conference participants and projection screens. Users  
should have control over lighting levels and the ability to focus  
lights in individual areas. For certain presentations, there may also  
be a benefit in providing the capability of a colour wash, for exam-  
ple by using LEDs to provide red, green, blue, yellow, etc.  
*AV capabilities*  
The majority of conferences and events rely heavily on AV equip-  
ment. To support this, there may be a need for a control room or  
position for technical staff to control the AV systems. **15-40 Auditoria**  
**15.78** *Lady Mitchell Hall, Cambridge. A large lecture theatre for 450 students. Architects\: Casson, Conder and Partners\: a\)*  
*Longitudinal section; b\) Plan of auditorium*  
In fully equipped conference halls, each person in the audience  
may be provided with\:  
• Voting buttons\: yes, no and abstain  
• Simultaneous translation headphones  
• Headphones for the hard of hearing  
• Illumination to read.  
The following is normally provided to be shared by two adja-  
cent participants\:  
• Microphone controlled by the chairperson from the platform  
• Button for ‘request-to-speak’.  
In less sophisticated or smaller-scale venues, AV facilities,  
including sound reinforcement, can provide the base technical  
requirements, while interactive participation might be managed  
with roaming microphones.  
*Internet and wireless access*  
Most people expect some form of connectivity, but participants  
and organisers may need to connect to the internet to retrieve  
important files and documents for their presentations. Adequate  
power points should be available for the speakers to plug in their  
laptops.  
Multi-national organisations may want to conduct live link-ups  
during the conference. Good quality internet is also needed to ena-  
ble the audience to use the internet and stream content.  
# 9.6 Platform  
The size and shape will depend on the extent of AV aids, lectern,  
demonstration table, panel table and other equipment as well as  
sightlines and size and shape of auditorium.  
The platform may need to accommodate only a single speaker at  
one time, with AV, white board and electronic display systems. In  
other cases, it will need to allow for scientific demonstrations, a panel  
of speakers with or without a lectern, or major presentations as with  
commercial, political and institutional organisations. For major politi-  
cal conferences, there can be as many as 50 people to accommodate on  
the platform. Means of access onto the platform from the auditorium  
will be required for speakers or panellists seated in the auditorium.  
The setting about the platform can be an architectural setting  
common to all types of presentations or a shell in which complete  
new settings can be constructed for each conference.  
# 9.7 Lectern  
This is the normal position for the speaker. The design of the lec-  
tern, see Figure 15.79, may vary to suit the interior design, but the  
ergonomic requirements are generally consistent. While the techni-  
cal capability of the venue may be sophisticated, controls should be  
clear and simple to enable the speaker to focus on the presentation  
and not be distracted by complexity.  
# 9.8 Other platform facilities  
*Demonstration bench*  
A ‘laboratory’ fully-serviced bench on the platform for the scien-  
tific demonstrations, with the supply of electricity, gas, water and **Auditoria 15-41**  
**15.79** *Lectern\: a\) Section; b\) Plan*  
drainage. The bench should be able to be wheeled off the platform  
if it is to be used for non-demonstration presentations, with plug-in  
services. The bench can be stored in the adjacent side preparation  
room.  
*Panel table*  
For discussion and presentations by a panel of speakers and a chair-  
person, a long table, parallel to the front edge of the platform, is a  
recognised format, with a chair and microphone for each panellist,  
and possibly simultaneous translation earphones. The table should  
be at least 750 mm deep, allowing 1 m length for each person. The  
name and details of each panellist may be mounted on the front  
edge of the table or on a stand in front of each. The lectern may or  
may not be used.  
*Platform setting*  
This may be a permanent enclosure with curtains, masking or slid-  
ing panels incorporated to mask sections of the side and rear walls.  
Alternatively, there may be a shell with rear and side walls and  
equipment constructed for a particular conference. This is similar  
to theatre open stage with suspension over the platform for setting  
and lighting. Coloured lighting or projections of images or logos  
may be used to enhance the scene setting for conference or pres-  
entation.  
*Signing*  
Signing can be undertaken by a signer in a prominent and clearly  
visible place on the platform to translate the speaker’s words into  
sign language, or through words projected onto a digital screen  
located on or around the platform.  
# 9.9 Translators’ booths  
Conferences with international audiences will probably require  
simultaneous interpretation by translators in booths of those speak-  
ing in various languages.  
Booths need to be located at the rear or perhaps the side of  
the auditorium with an unobstructed view by the translator of the  
speaker, chairperson, projection screens and chalkboards as well as  
any visual display. The booths are soundproofed, with the transla-  
tor listening to the speech on headphones.  
Booths should be located side by side with acoustic isolation  
and small connecting windows. They should open off a corridor  
giving discrete but secure access from the public areas. Booth inte-  
rior should have absorbent material to walls, floor and ceiling, in  
dark matt colours.  
Each booth needs to be able to accommodate two or three seated  
persons, minimum size 6.5 m wide and 6.4 m deep. The soundproof  
observation window can be the full width of the booth, 800 mm  
high, and may be inclined to avoid acoustic reflections on either  
side. The translators need a clear working surface 500 mm wide in  
front of the window for scripts, notes, microphone, channel-selec-  
tion buttons, indicator lights, etc.  
*Simultaneous translation systems in the auditorium*  
Available methods are\:  
• Induction loop\: magnetic field transmission generated by a con-  
ductor looped around the auditorium; conference delegates have  
portable receivers  
• Infra-red\: modulated light signals radiated from a number of  
sources; delegates have portable receivers  
• Hard-wired\: cable within underfloor trunking connected to pan-  
els in armrest or back of each seat for heavily used conference  
facilities.  
# 9.10 Audiovisual facilities  
*Control room*  
This is a limited requirement for conferences, but lighting control  
could be incorporated into a projection room at the rear of the audi-  
torium, minimum size 2 × 3.5 m. In some cases, a dimmer room  
may be needed \(see Section 6.3\).  
*Sound control room*  
In this case, an open room preferably at the rear of the auditorium  
adjacent to the lighting control room, minimum size 2 × 3.5 m.  
Here the amplified sound from one or more speakers can be mixed  
and balanced. The sound control desk may alternatively be situated  
within the auditorium.  
*Screens and projectors*  
Projectors are usually mounted at high level in the auditorium, on  
stands or behind the screen, Close-range projectors can produce  
pictures up to 3 m high; they should be 3.5 to 3.6 times the picture  
width from the screen.  
There are special projectors which can be much closer to screens  
nowadays. These include short throw and ultra short throw projec-  
tors that allow users to create big pictures in tight spaces without  
concerns about shadows obstructing the image or light shining in  
the presenter’s face.  
These projectors have very short throw ratios – the distance  
from projector to screen compared to the screen size. While a reg-  
ular projector with a 1.5\:1 throw ratio would have to be 7.5 feet  
back to project a 60-inch wide image, a short throw projector with  
a throw ratio of 0.6\:1 can project the same image when placed less  
than 3 feet away from the screen. An ultra short throw projector  
with a 0.37\:1 throw ratio can project the same image from just 1.85  
feet away.  
For a large screen, a long-range projector can be used to pro-  
duce a picture up to 7.5 m high. It should be housed in a projection **15-42 Auditoria**  
**15.80** *Video projector mounted at high level in auditorium. More*  
*recent projectors are likely to be of different dimensions. Noise*  
*generated by the projector must also be checked*  
room because of background noise levels generated by the equip-  
ment. For less powerful equipment and a shorter projection throw,  
a projector can be mounted or suspended from the ceiling; see  
Figure 15.80\. For small conference and seminar rooms, digital  
monitors can be used.  
Where films are screened, digital projection predominates.  
A facility for 35 mm film projection may be retained in auditoria  
screening archive material. Film projection in 16 mm and 8 mm is  
now uncommon, as video has taken its place in the majority of cases.  
*Television and digital film recording*  
Conferences are frequently televised and recorded. Speakers and  
demonstrations are often projected on large screens both within  
the main conference hall and in overflow venues. Digital cam-  
era recorders are now very compact and lightweight and usually  
mobile, but require suitable floor surfaces for tripods in low light.  
A room may be required for recording and editing purposes, but  
this may not need direct vision of the conference and could in fact  
be a remote studio.  
*Voting panel*  
This is a panel indicating electronically the numbers voting by  
pressing buttons at each seat, mounted above the platform and con-  
trolled by the chairperson.  
# 9.11 Platform\: associated spaces  
• Ante-room\: reception and waiting areas for conference chairper-  
son and speakers, with lounge, changing facilities and toilets;

tions in room immediately off the platform

# 10 CINEMAS  
# 10.1 Types of film and method of projection  
Cinema projection was traditionally film-based but has now been  
replaced by high definition, digital projection technologies in most  
cinemas with a few retaining 35 mm/70 mm projectors alongside  
digital projectors. There has been an overall shift to digital cinema  
as the standard, with film formats relegated to secondary impor-  
tance except for specialist venues. The shift to digital projection  
has led to a surge in neighbourhood cinemas and the creative adap-  
tation of existing buildings for cinema use.  
The majority of films are now screened in Flat screen format or  
in Scope format with very few films released in the old Academy  
format.  
Film projection in cinemas normally uses 35 mm film but can  
also use 70 mm or 16 mm \(generally for smaller or specialised  
cinemas\). Large formats such as IMAX use special 15 perforation  
70 mm film projection systems to produce very wide and tall screen  
images. Both film and digital projection systems can be adapted to  
produce 3D images. The various film and digital projection types  
are shown in Table XI.  
# 10.2 Methods of projection  
There are five methods of cinema projection\:  
• Direct projection from the rear of the auditorium onto the screen  
from a projection or control room. This is the most common  
method by far.  
• Direct projection from the centre or rear of the auditorium onto  
the screen, from an acoustically isolated and ventilated pod  
mounted from the ceiling or rear wall of the auditorium. There  
are new models of digital projector that can be mounted in an  
auditorium without the need for enclosing them in a pod.  
• Indirect film projection, where the projection requires one or  
more mirrors. This method is used where lack of space or struc-  
tural difficulties make direct projection difficult to achieve.  
Mirror projection requires a powerful light source and the  
screen cannot be wider than 9m. This method is not recom-  
mended.  
• Rear projection. This is not possible with a curved screen, but  
may be applicable for a smaller auditorium. For this method, the  
picture needs to be reversed, for which mirrors can be an eco-  
nomic solution when film projection is used. Digital projection  
can reverse an image, so there is no need for mirrors.  
• Direct view screens such as Samsung Onyx. Issues to note are  
the high capital cost, the weight of the screen installation and the  
high heat output. There is an option not to darken the auditorium  
when it is being used for conference use.  
# 10.3 Auditorium design  
Functional requirements include\:  
• Every member of the audience requires an unobstructed view of  
the whole picture area on the screen, without visual and physical  
discomfort or picture distortion.  
• Picture sharpness and luminance should be uniform and at a  
satisfactory level of brightness. Sound reproduction should be  
distortion free.  
• Integration of seating for members of the audience with mobility  
disabilities.  
• Cinema with Premium Large Format \(PLF\) auditoria, such as  
IMAX and Dolby Cinema, have particular requirements for  
projection, sound, seating and auditorium design, which are  
specified by the relevant equipment supplier or cinema opera-  
tor. These types of format could be just a standard large screen  
along with Dolby ATMOS/DTS to immersive formats such as  
4DX with motion seats. Screen X270 degree viewing needs  
additional projectors and surfaces on the side walls that work  
as screens. **Auditoria 15-43**

# 10.4 Viewing conditions  
Viewing criteria are shown in plan, see Figure 15.81a–c; and sec-  
tion, see Figure 15.82b. The size and shape of the screen must be  
related to the shape and rake of the auditorium floor. Seating rake  
is less critical than for concert halls and theatres as the screen can  
be elevated, and sound comes from speakers set behind the screen  
surface.  
*Seating arrangements*  
Few new auditoria are designed with galleries or balconies \(unless  
the auditorium is required for other forms of performance\). Steeply  
tiered stadia seating offers an opportunity for good sightlines onto  
a large screen relative to audience numbers.  
In small auditoria, stadia seating may be arranged in a single  
tier to optimise seating capacity. To provide a choice of seating for  
members of the audience with mobility disabilities, access should  
be provided for wheelchair users to the front and rear rows.  
In larger auditoria, access may be provided onto a cross aisle  
with steeply tiered stadia seating to the rear of the cross aisle and a  
gentle rake to the front rows. A choice of seating position for mem-  
bers of the audience with mobility disabilities can be on the cross  
aisle or in the front row.  
*Seating types*  
A variety of types of seating are now being used. Recliners are  
increasingly being used in multiplexes. Sofas and armchair seats  
are commonly used in boutique cinemas. Dine-in cinemas require  
adequately sized tables at each seat and a kitchen facility to service  
the food offer in the auditoria.  
Expectations of comfort evolve over time. Until recently,  
550 mm seat centres and 1100 mm seat tier widths was considered  
an acceptable benchmark for fixed seating. Currently, 600 mm seat  
centres and 1200 mm seat tier widths are more prevalent as a min-  
imum, with an increasing number of cinemas being fitted out with  
seats at 650 mm centres and 1300 mm seat tier widths.  
Seat tier widths are governed not only by expectations of com-  
fort, but by choice of seat type and statutory requirements for  
minimum clear seatways. Comfortable, fixed seats rather than tip-  
out seats are now prevalent in cinema fit-outs. Sofa seats, either  
combined with fixed seats or used throughout an auditorium, are  
also common.  
To accommodate ‘premium’ armchair or sofa seats offer-  
ing extra comfort, tables and at-seat service, seat tiers of up to  
1500 mm wide may be required. A requirement to accommodate  
cup holders, bottle holders or small tables will influence the choice  
of seat, seat centres and seat tier widths. To accommodate recliner  
seats and seats with small tables for food/drinks, 900 mm seat cen-  
tres and 2000 mm seat tier widths should be anticipated with exact  
dimensions dependant on the choice of seat.  
In multi-use auditoria with a flat floor regularly used for cinema  
screenings, retractable seating systems with straight and curved  
rows, and comfortable cinema style seats are available.  
*Aisle arrangements*  
The maximum number of seats permitted in a row is not only gov-  
erned by viewing criteria but statutory requirements. The aisle  
arrangement and clear seatway are critical factors. The maximum  
number of seats permitted in a row with a single aisle is 12, irre-  
spective of the seatway width. **15-44 Auditoria**  
**15.81** *Projection and viewing criteria for various formats\: a\) 16* *mm film; b\) 35* *mm film; c\) 70 mm film in specialist cinemas* **Auditoria 15-45**

*tiered seating with cross aisle \(specialist and digital cinemas\); Projection criteria and vertical sightlines\: d\) stadia seating \(specialist*  
*and digital cinemas\) and projection criteria \(digital cinemas\)* **15-46 Auditoria**  
A single centre aisle is not favoured as it occupies seat posi-  
tions with the best viewing conditions, as well as splitting the  
audience. An offset single aisle provides a more cohesive seating  
arrangement for the audience as a whole and provides an oppor-  
tunity to accommodate seats for couples in the shorter row. The  
provision of two side aisles enables the numbers in a single row  
to be increased.  
It is good practice to avoid entrances at the screen end of the  
cinema, in order to prevent disturbance by latecomers.  
# 10.5 Acoustics for films  
The sound track is an integral part of the audience experience.  
The quality of sound reproduction has vastly improved in recent  
decades, and cinemas are now equipped with many channel sound  
systems which require acoustically dead auditoria – the ideal is a  
zero reverberation time. Hence all finishes – floor, walls, ceiling  
and seats – need to be sound absorbent. Side walls should ideally  
not be parallel, and rear walls should not be curved unless treated  
with absorbent material. The auditorium should be acoustically  
isolated from external noise and structure borne noise. A suitable  
ambient noise standard for cinemas is NR25 to NR30. Air volumes  
will be dependent on occupancy levels in the auditoria.  
# 10.6 Access  
The design of the auditoria should optimise the experience of going  
to the cinema for all members of the audience.  
*Mobility disabilities*  
A choice of position for wheelchair users should be provided. This  
should be integrated within the main body of seating. Suitable posi-  
tions on a level surface may include the front row, cross aisle or  
back row. It should be possible for a wheelchair user to sit next to  
a companion, whether another wheelchair user or not. Wheelchair  
positions should not be limited to the front row, where viewing  
angles are most acute.  
*Visual impairment*  
Space should be provided for a guide dog at the end of a row.  
Facilities for screening films with audio description are based on  
visually impaired audience members collecting headsets before  
entering the auditorium. The headsets operate from one of the  
channels on the infrared or wireless \(RF\) system.  
Low-level lighting on stepped or raking aisles, with the light  
source located out of the line of vision of the screen, is an aid to all  
members of the audience.  
*Aural impairment*  
Facilities may include permanently installed, inductive loop  
systems and/or infra-red/wireless \(RF\) systems. A system of  
superimposing a subtitle \(soft title\) image is also available for the  
profoundly deaf. This system is incorporated into the digital cin-  
ema projector and does not require an additional projection system.  
# 10.7 Lighting  
Auditorium systems such as lighting and curtains activated to start  
and finish a show are usually automated. The automation system  
will also turn off the projector and raise the emergency lights when  
and if required. These services are integrated with the cinema film  
server.  
The different types of lighting which need to be provided within  
a cinema auditorium are\:  
• *House lights*\: Decorative lights which set the ambiance of the  
auditorium when the audience enters and are gradually dimmed  
before the screening.  
• *Curtain lights*\: Highlight the screen curtains/screen surface prior  
to the screening. Colours are usually generated by LED light  
sources.  
• *Primary lighting*\: Powered from the mains supply, this provides  
a low level of lighting during screenings equivalent to the level  
of lighting provided by the secondary emergency lighting in the  
event of mains failure. It is essential that this is no brighter than  
required to meet statutory requirements to avoid distraction dur-  
ing screenings.  
• *Secondary \(emergency\) lighting*\: Powered by a central battery  
or local battery packs this provides a low level of illumination in  
the event of mains failure.  
• *Illuminated emergency exit signs*\: These are dual-fed \(mains  
powered and powered by a central battery or local battery packs\),  
and remain illuminated during screenings and in the event of  
mains failure and an emergency. It is bad practice to locate exits  
and hence illuminated emergency exit signs within the same  
plane or in close proximity to the screen. Illuminated exit signs  
should be selected to minimise disturbance through light spill-  
age during screenings. Preferred models have green legends on a  
black background in a matt black casing. In some cases, the exit  
signs may be dimmable during the main show and come to full  
brightness in case of an emergency or at the end of the show.  
• *Cleaners’ lights*\: House lights that are energy efficient may dou-  
ble up as cleaners’ lights. Alternatively, separate cleaners’ lights  
are installed. These need to be controllable from the projection  
room and/or the usher’s position in the event of an emergency  
\(other than mains failure\), for example a medical emergency.  
• *Speakers’ lights*\: In auditoria, these are used for awards cere-  
monies and panel discussions before or after screenings, or for  
conference use.  
Regard needs to be given to lamp life and ease of changing the  
bulbs when considering the location and specification of all light  
fittings within a cinema auditorium.  
# 10.8 Interiors  
It is good practice for the lighting design and colour scheme on the  
approaches to the auditorium to assist members of the audience to  
adjust to lighting levels within the auditorium. It is also advisable  
to avoid light colours and reflective surfaces within a cinema audi-  
torium, to avoid distraction during screenings. Dark wall coverings  
and seats are ideal to minimise light reflections.  
# 10.9 Screens  
*Shape*  
Film and digital projectors may be required to project material in a  
variety of width-to-height ratios. Digital projection in commercial  
cinemas normally uses two ratios\: Flat 1\:1.85 and Scope 1\:2.39  
Film projection picture formats varied throughout the history of  
cinema but the most frequently encountered are 1\:1.33 \(described  
as 4\:3 in video terminology\) 1\:1.66, 1\:1.85 and 1\:2.39. High defini-  
tion television normally uses a 1\:1.78 ratio \(16\:9 for video\).  
*Size*  
The largest 35 mm screens will usually be less than 18 m in width.  
Digital cinema projectors can now illuminate a picture size in  
excess of 40 m if not larger.  
*Curvature*  
For uniform focus, a large screen should be curved to keep its sur-  
face equidistant from the centre of the lens and improves viewing  
for 3D formats.  
*Luminance*  
Screens may have a matt white surface or a special high reflectivity  
surface \(high gain screens\) that is particularly suitable for larger  
screens where the luminance needs to be enhanced. 3D projection  
systems which rely on polarised spectacles for viewers require a  
high reflectivity surface to maintain the polarised light, although  
these may be less satisfactory for conventional 2D projection. *Position*  
seating.  
The centre of screen should be on the central axis of the auditorium  
*Masking*  
Mechanically adjustable black masking to the sides and top of the  
screen is often provided to contain the picture surface and obtain  
maximum apparent screen brightness. The masking is usually wool  
serge on metal rails, and the motorised pulley system should be  
fixed at floor level for ease of maintenance. Movement is remotely  
controlled from the projection room. It is becoming more of a  
standard to use ‘floating screen frames’ with no masking; the frame  
is dressed in black serge including the bottom picture line. No mov-  
ing masking is used with these type of frames.  
*Unmasked screens*  
Unmasked \(floating frames\) screens are used in many multiplex  
cinemas and some specialised cinemas. They are most suitable  
when used with digital projection systems which can produce a  
‘clean’ picture edge.  
Edge/halo lighting is sometimes used with unmasked screens as  
part of the decorative lighting scheme.  
*Construction*  
Screen material is either PVC or metalised fabric, held by cord lac-  
ing to hooks on a metal lattice frame. Generally, cinema screens  
are perforated to allow high quality sound reproduction from the  
speakers positioned behind the screen. Different sized perforations  
are available. Digital cinema projection and small auditoria usu-  
ally require smaller size perforations. Unperforated screens may  
be used in specific circumstances such as lecture halls. In these  
circumstances, loudspeakers cannot be placed behind the screen  
surface.  
*Temporary screens*  
In some multi-use auditoria, screens may need to be easily and  
conveniently removed. A flat screen up to 10 m wide can be incor-  
porated into a proscenium stage of a theatre and either housed,  
when rolled, above the stage or flown in the flytower. Curved  
screens could be flown, but take up much valuable space in the  
flytower; or they could be stored at the rear of the stage if fitted  
with rollers or castors for ease of movement. Roller screens are not  
recommended for metalised fabric screens \(3D\).  
*Speaker installation*  
The speakers need to be located behind the screen, firmly fixed  
to the platform or screen frame. One speaker is needed for mono-  
phonic sound \(not often used nowadays\). For multi-channel and  
stereophonic sound, three speaker units are necessary – one cen-  
trally placed and the others equidistant from it to the left and right.  
Sound production in 70 mm requires five units symmetrically  
placed about the horizontal axis of the central speaker and the same  
would be said for digital immersive sound systems depending on  
the specifications of said system.  
A sub-woofer low-frequency speaker is usually located cen-  
trally behind the cinema screen. Depending on the installation,  
there could be more than a single sub-woofer. Surround sound sys-  
tems are widely used in cinemas and require a number of small or  
mid-size wall-mounted units on the left, right and rear auditorium  
walls.  
Surround speakers are placed on side and rear walls of audi-  
toria. Immersive sound systems such as Dolby ATMOS/DTS and  
Barco Auro also include speakers in the ceiling directly above the  
audience. These immersive sound systems may have more than 60  
speaker positions located behind the screen, around the walls and  
across the ceiling. Structural support for the array of loud speak-  
ers mounted across the auditorium ceiling will be required. These  
speakers can be embedded within the ceiling but provision must  
# Auditoria 15-47  
be made for the speakers to be angled appropriately. The manu-  
facturer and service company will provide a detailed layout of all  
the speaker positions. This may affect other service provision and  
consultation with the provider should be taken at an early stage.  
*Platform*  
The entire wall surface behind the screen should be covered with  
black tissue-faced insulation. The screen can be set over a platform  
with a forestage, carpeted with black carpet to prevent reflection  
of sound and light. The forestage edge can be vertical, splayed or  
stepped. Some theatres now build baffle walls behind the screen  
that incorporate the theatre stage loudspeakers.  
*Stage for speakers and small-scale performance*  
In cinemas used for speeches or panel discussions before or after  
screenings, awards ceremonies or occasional lecture or confer-  
ences, it should be possible for all audience members to have a  
clear view of the participants’ faces.  
Usually this will require the provision of a raised stage in front  
of the screen, although with steeply tiered stadia seating this may  
not be necessary.  
AV and IT provision at the speaker’s position, linked back to  
the projection room, needs to be considered. On a new installation,  
tie lines should be installed as the norm including Ethernet cables.  
Access to the stage for speakers or panel members with mobil-  
ity disabilities needs to be considered.  
In cinemas seeking to attract young audiences, there is an  
increasing interest in small-scale live performance in conjunction  
with film exhibition.  
*Internet provision*  
Provision should be made for large bandwidth 30/100 mbs internet  
provision for downloading content to the film/library server. High-  
speed fibre lines would be of benefit if available.  
# 10.10 Projection suite  
A projection suite provides space for all the image projection and  
sound reproduction equipment in a cinema. Contemporary cinema  
design aims for a single projection suite to cover all the audito-  
ria. Most cinemas provide automated systems that allow complete  
performances to be screened with minimal staff input. Specialised  
cinemas and lecture halls rely less on automated systems.  
Digital cinema projectors can be installed in a conventional  
projection suite or, especially for smaller auditoria, in an acous-  
tically insulated and ventilated enclosure or pod. Pods for digital  
projectors, other than other than laser projectors also require cool-  
ing. There is a range of proprietary pods available that can either  
be ceiling mounted or mounted on the rear wall of the auditorium.  
There are new smaller models of digital projector which can be  
mounted in the auditorium without an enclosure or pod. Digital  
film storage and playback along with audio equipment can be  
located in the projection suite or in a nearby location such as an  
office or equipment room with appropriate temperature and venti-  
lation control.  
Projection suites and equipment rooms should be secure from  
access by the general public.  
*Digital projection*  
Digital cinema projectors have approximately the same footprint  
as 35 mm projectors, although smaller models are now available.  
2 K and 4 K projectors can achieve image widths up of 40 m or  
more nowadays. 6 P digital laser projectors can achieve 60 m plus  
picture size. There is a cooling requirement for the racks of lasers  
that supply the projector.  
A single projector can be used for 3D projection, but has to  
produce approximately twice the light output as that used for  
2D projection. Two projectors can be used to increase the lumi-  
nance in larger theatres. Some 3D equipment is fitted in front of **15-48 Auditoria**  
the projector lens assembly and requires approximately 500 mm  
from the projection lens to the porthole glass for installation and  
removal.  
There are two types of 3D glasses in use, the disposable and  
reusable. It should be taken into account that glasses should be  
easy to distribute and to collect. The reusable glasses are more  
expensive, and because they have to be handed back to the cinema  
after the screening, anti-theft issues should be taken into account.  
Facilities will be required to clean and store the glasses.  
A typical digital projection system is comprised of\:  
• A projector head, lamphouse and lamp power supply. These are  
usually housed together in a single module.  
• Digital cinema film server and storage system can be rack  
mounted along with the theatre’s sound processor and  
amplification system, or in some cases under the projector’s  
lamphouse. Many digital projectors are supplied with an inte-  
grated media server \(IMS\) which does not require a separate  
media server in most cases, just a network link to a theatre  
management system \(TMS\). Sometimes network storage  
\(NAS\) is added to the IMS if extra storage for more films is  
required.  
• In many cinemas, there is a requirement to play live relays or  
recorded performances of opera, concerts, theatre and dance per-  
formances, gallery and museum tours and other events. Other  
non-cinema uses may comprise of corporate slide presentations  
or video gaming.  
Additional equipment may include\:  
• Multimedia playback box, digital to analogue sound inter-  
face, audio delay, DVD/Blu-Ray playback, satellite dish and  
transcoder for live events and downloading digital cinema and  
live relay content \(‘event cinema’\), space for HD disc player/VR  
playback, monitor and fibre optic cabling.  
Digital cinema projectors require venting at approximately  
600/650 cfm. Projection rooms and projector pods should be  
cooled to approximately 21°C.  
# 11 SUPPORT FACILITIES  
# 11.1 Introduction  
This section covers the front-of-house or publicly accessible areas  
where the audience arrives and assembles before entering the audi-  
torium. It also deals with the facilities that support or enhance the  
public areas and the management of the venue, as well as the back-  
of-house or backstage areas that support the shows and productions  
that are presented in the venue.  
Front-of-house areas need to present a welcoming and enjoya-  
ble place to visit, as well as serving to attract new people. Foyers  
do far more than acting as an area to muster and process audiences  
before entering the auditorium. Increasingly, the whole operation  
of the venue needs to be run like a business in order to sustain  
itself, not only in the evenings prior to a performance, but by pro-  
gramming events throughout the day. In this way, the venue can  
make use of facilities that might otherwise stand idle and can raise  
additional revenue to support the venue.  
In the backstage areas, the cost of mounting shows is also  
an important consideration. Increasingly, more theatre venues  
are unable to support the range of workshop, storage and pro-  
duction areas needed to mount a show. They therefore become  
‘receiving houses’ which rely on outside specialist workshops  
or producing theatres to make the scenery, or otherwise receive  
product or shows created elsewhere. In contrast to ‘receiv-  
ing houses’, ‘producing houses’ are venues for opera, dance,  
musical theatre and drama companies, which initiate their own  
productions.  
# 11.2 Entrance doors and lobbies  
These require\:  
• Arrival and drop-off  
• Ease of access from car parking and public transport  
• Prominent venue signage  
• Easily accessible approach with clearly identifiable entrance  
• Canopy to provide shelter at entrance  
• Provision for posters and other promotional information  
• Welcoming and inviting aspect  
• Draught lobby  
• Automatic sliding doors.  
It is recommended to follow the guidance set out in British Standard  
BS 8300–2\:2018 *Designing of an Accessible and Inclusive Built*  
*Environment* for information needed to create an inclusive environ-  
ment to all areas of the building outside of the auditorium.  
# 11.3 Entrance foyer  
Foyers and facilities within them need to be adaptable to meet dif-  
ferent needs to suit different programming.  
• Foyers, open-plan circulation, routes and stairs\: these should  
avoid bottlenecks, cramped areas and cross-flow of audiences  
queuing for the box office, bar, toilets, cloakrooms or even the  
auditorium at peak times  
• Lifts, for access to upper or lower levels  
• Box office counters may now be combined with general recep-  
tion desks including office spaces and stage door, while ticket  
machines are increasingly used as a means of buying and col-  
lecting tickets  
• Registration \(conference hall\)\: counter or table  
• Reception and information\: counter  
• Cloakroom \(not usual in cinema\)\: attended or unattended  
• Creche\: at least 6.5 m2 per child  
• First-aid room\: bed, wash-hand basin  
• Toilets\: see Chapter 2, People and space  
• Lounge areas\: standing height shelves for drinks where space  
limited, tables, chairs, display stands, lounge seating  
• Performance area\: within foyer or separate area  
• Education and community events\: studio or suite of spaces for  
such events  
• Space and display for exhibitions\: see Chapter 28, Museums, art  
galleries and temporary exhibition spaces  
• Auditorium lobbies\: barriers to sound and light at entry points  
into the auditorium; the level of lighting should assist adap-  
tation to and from the dark auditorium and the brighter foyer  
lighting.  
# 11.4 Places to eat and drink  
Noise from these areas needs to be carefully managed to avoid  
affecting performances in the auditorium. These may include\:  
• Coffee bar  
• Licensed bar \(often referred to as the ‘crush bar’ because of peak  
periods before a show or during short intervals\)  
• Self-service food counter  
• Restaurant  
• Banquet room  
• Private room  
• Associated spaces \(bar store, cellar, kitchen, storage, staff rooms,  
manager’s offices, delivery, refuse\).  
# 11.5 Sales  
These may include\:  
• Shops and merchandise outlets\: display cases, shelving, office,  
storage, security; see Chapter 34, Retail shops and stores • Kiosk and other food counters\: display cases, shelving, micro-  
wave oven, stockroom \(confectionery, drinks, etc.\) with possible  
refrigerator and freezers for ice creams; security.  
# 11.6 Meeting rooms  
Breakout rooms, sponsors’ rooms; equipped for receptions, and  
small group lectures, discussions and workshops.  
# 11.7 Important guests, VIPs and sponsors rooms  
Reception rooms or separately defined spaces for distinguished vis-  
itors or sponsors, with attendant lounge and toilets.  
# 11.8 Exhibition hall  
Displays including trade exhibitions; storage, deliveries, possible  
separate public entrance; see Chapter 28, Museums, art galleries

photocopiers, translators, secretarial work, see Chapter 29, Offices.  
# 11.11 Outdoor areas  
Gathering area at front doors; associated with foyer and places to  
eat and drink as external terraces; store for outdoor furniture; land-  
scaping.  
# 11.12 Signage  
This includes\:  
• *External*\: name of venue, current and future events  
• *Internal*\: direction signs to the various public attractions.  
# 11.13 Managerial and maintenance spaces  
These include\:  
• *Administrative offices*\: functions may include policy, house  
management, accounts, personnel, marketing, press and pub-  
licity, development and community programmes, clerical work.  
Associated spaces may include boardroom, storage, strong room,  
office services and equipment, entrance and reception, toilets.  
• *Box office*\: room for postal and telephone bookings, storage of  
sales records and accounts; access to changing, relaxation and  
toilet facilities.  
• *Men’s and women’s staff rest rooms*\: lockers, lounge chairs,  
refreshments and toilets.  
• *Sales and trays store*\: refrigerator for ice cream, shelves for  
confectionery, programmes, documents and other items for sale  
or distribution; storage of sales trays; table; washhand basin;  
located directly off the public areas.  
• *Maintenance workshop, office and, in larger venues, store*.  
• *Cleaners’ stores*\: central storage of materials and equipment;  
cupboards with sink, cleaning materials and equipment through-  
out building.  
• *Security control room*\: surveillance monitors, fire-detection sys-  
tems, alarms, service monitors, paging systems, locking devices.  
• *Refuse*\: external provision for dustbins, well ventilated and eas-  
ily cleaned.  
• *Catering facilities*\: the scale of the operation may justify the  
inclusion of catering facilities for all staff, typically in a facility  
known as the ‘Green Room’.  
# 11.14 Get-in \(receiving theatres\)  
The get-in is one of the most important considerations in the design  
and arrangement of a theatre venue. It is where visiting companies,  
# Auditoria 15-49  
productions or sets are delivered. Large vehicles may need to  
deliver to the scene dock, sometimes during inclement weather.  
This also needs to facilitate the get-out, often late at night after a  
show has finished and when the crew may be tired.  
Delivery vehicles should be parked on the level, so that carrying  
or wheeling large and heavy items from the back of the vehicle into  
the scene dock can be done without pushing up a slope or restrain-  
ing down an incline. Long items, typically at least 6 m long and  
up to 4 m high need to be manoeuvred through to the stage area,  
platform or scene store. During winter months, heat from the stage  
area and auditorium can escape to the outside and so arrangements  
need to be made to protect this.  
Delivery vehicles need to be parked somewhere within the site  
curtilage when not in use with sufficient turning and reversing  
space allowed.  
# 11.15 Other spaces  
• A small office for a tour manager equipped with a desk, tele-  
phone and internet connection  
• Green Room facilities by way of a staff canteen or kitchen area  
and some comfortable chairs or sofas as part of the venue’s back-  
stage provision is normally appreciated by touring performers  
• Rehearsal space and repair workshop for repairs and main-  
tenance of sets and production equipment, such as lanterns,  
electrical leads, sound systems, etc.  
• Space to repair and clean costumes may also be a requirement.  
# 11.16 Production spaces  
Producing theatres typically require the following spaces\:  
• Offices for the functions of artistic policy, direction, production  
development, instruction, design, production organisation, busi-  
ness management, development programmes and clerical work  
• Associated spaces may include boardroom, library, music room,  
audition room, working conference room, model-making facil-  
ities, dark room, general storage, office services, refreshment  
areas, toilets, entrance and reception.  
# 11.17 Rehearsal spaces  
A relationship diagram for a rehearsal suite is shown in Figure  
15.83\. Long hours can be spent in these areas and it is therefore  
desirable that they should provide daylight and privacy. The suite  
may include\:  
• Rehearsal room or rehearsal studio able to accommodate the  
largest performing area on the stage, which is plotted out in the  
rehearsal studio, plus 2 m on three sides and 3 m on one long side  
as a minimum for circulation space around the performing area.  
• Practice studios for individual or small group practice, for exam-  
ple for dancers who need mirrors along one wall that can be  
curtained off; see Figure 15.84.  
• Associated spaces may include lounge, changing rooms, toilets,  
storage of equipment.  
# 11.18 Scenery workshops  
The substantial facilities required where the manufacture and main-  
tenance of scenery is involved is well illustrated in Figure 15.85.  
These include\:  
*Offices*  
For head of carpentry workshop, head of paint shop and head of  
property department.  
*Carpentry workshop*  
For the construction of scenery; power operated tools \(such as  
woodworking machine, mortise, circular and bandsaws, and  
lathes\); benches for carpentry, assembly and canvassing; storage  
of raw materials such as timber, sheet materials, rolls of materials, **15-50 Auditoria**

**15.85** *Plan of workshops in the Leeds Playhouse, Leeds*  
**15.84** *Section through wall barres in rehearsal studio for dance*  
*practice*  
nails and screws and so on, including polystyrene sheets which  
may require a separate fire-resistant enclosure.  
*Paint shop*  
For the painting of scenery, accommodating various methods of  
painting backcloths and flats \(flat on the floor, on mobile frame or  
fixed frame and gantry\), and 3D pieces; benches for mixing paints  
and other preparation and cleaning brushes; storage requirements  
for raw materials such as paints and fire-proofing, and equipment  
such as brushes and spray equipment. Paints may need to be stored  
in a fire-proof enclosure.  
*Metalwork shop*  
For the use of metal in the preparation of scenery; provision for  
welding, cutting and fabricating metalwork items; benches, weld-  
ing screens and bending machinery; storage of raw materials such  
as sheets, tubes and bars, bolts, nuts and screws.  
*Trial assembly area*  
Area for the erection of a trial assembly of the set under construc-  
tion, the size of the performing area of the stage. *Property department*  
For worktops and storage of raw materials. Separate workshops  
may be required for work with associated fire-resistant require-  
ments and extraction of toxic gases and another for work with other  
materials.  
*Delivery and storage*  
For raw materials being delivered to the carpentry workshop,  
paint shop, metalwork shop and property department, including  
unloading bay and parking of delivery vans and lorries. There may  
also be requirements for the storage of scenery and properties for  
re-use.  
# 11.19 Layout of workshops  
A level floor is required through unloading bays, workshops, scen-  
ery store and stage, giving a clear, broad passage of movement of  
scenery onto the stage. Where a change of level is unavoidable, a  
lift will be inevitable but is not recommended. The passage from  
the unloading bay to the stage for touring companies should be  
direct without interfering with the workshops.  
The paint frame and backcloth storage should be placed so that  
the rolled backcloths can be moved horizontally into position under  
the flytower or grid with the painted surface facing the audience.  
The large doors or roller shutters required for the movement of  
scenery should not also be used for people. The minimum dimen-  
sions of the openings should be determined by the maximum size  
of scenery expected.  
The carpentry shop should be isolated from the paint shop to  
avoid noise and sawdust penetration, and both areas should be  
acoustically insulated from the stage. Scenery storage located  
between workshops and stage acts as a sound barrier.  
# Auditoria 15-51  
# 11.20 Wardrobe space  
Wardrobe space is required for\:  
• Making and fitting of performers’ costumes  
• Making and fitting associated items such as wigs  
• Storing, repairing and cleaning costumes  
• Making millinery and accessories  
• Dyeing cloth and spraying materials  
• Storing rolls of cloth and pattern paper  
• Storing small items such as sewing materials, dyestuffs  
• Delivery of raw materials including unloading bay and parking  
of delivery vans  
• Office for costume supervisor.  
Performers require easy access to the wardrobe for fitting cos-  
tumes, while the distribution of finished costumes for, and their  
cleaning during, a production suggests a location close to the dress-  
ing rooms.  
# 11.21 Digital suite  
For sound effects and music. This requires an isolated space where  
digital editing can be undertaken. Associated areas may include a  
library of digital recordings, entry lounge and lobby.  
# 11.22 Common facilities  
Provision for resting, changing, refreshment \(Green Room\), toilets  
and showers.  
# 11.23 Transport  
Van or vans for the collections and delivery of goods, with parking  
spaces within the curtilage of the site. **16 Civic buildings**

# 1 TOWN HALLS  
# 1.1 Introduction  
The concept of the town hall as a local civic and community focus  
has a continuing importance for communities. Local authorities  
are, however, significantly reviewing their modus operandi and the  
physical needs of their buildings.  
A developing direction in the design of town halls is towards a  
flexible, modern facility that delivers high quality services to the  
public. Local authorities are consolidating their property portfolios  
in order to achieve greater efficiencies operationally and in terms  
of building stock. The name civic centre is considered as a more  
appropriate description or title, and even more fashionable expres-  
sions such as ‘The Hub’ or ‘The Cube’ have been adopted where  
the association with an outdated concept of local authority admin-  
istration is no longer desired.  
Although many of the key spatial requirements are similar to  
the traditional town hall model the emphasis has changed from the  
corridors of power to a building that provides services and facilities  
for the community, see Figure 16.1. The nature of the spaces has  
arguably become more demanding in terms of flexibility and there-  
fore more generic rather than bespoke to a location.  
Although local authorities may have different requirements, the  
new town hall or civic centre is likely to require the following prin-  
cipal components\:  
• Members’ accommodation  
• Council chamber  
• Community hall  
• Committee rooms and meeting rooms  
• Offices  
• Reception  
• Customer services  
• Library  
• Events spaces.

DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-19 **16-1** **16-2 Civic buildings**  
# 1.2 Members’ accommodation  
Traditionally, the town hall was a place where the facilities  
accorded to the decision-making role of elected councillors were  
celebrated by a very high quality of traditional finishes setting  
those areas above others in terms of importance and status.  
More recently, however, where members’ facilities are pro-  
vided in new accommodation, the standard of finishes and furniture  
is required to match that of the council’s offices or administration  
areas in order that members are not seen to have a higher standard  
of finishes or be enjoying lavish benefits associated with their  
elected position. Instead, members’ offices are modern, flexible  
and deliberately non-specific to party colours.  
# 1.2 Council chamber  
The function of the council chamber as a space for council meetings  
continues and is likely to continue as long as the current format for  
local democracy exists. Their traditional forms are mostly segmen-  
tal or horseshoe, see Figures 16.2 and 16.3.  
**16.2** *Hammersmith Town Hall’s Council Chamber suite is an example of a triple-tiered horseshoe configuration*  
**16.3** *Council chamber, various layout types \(1= mayor, 2 = ordinary members, 3 = officers, 4 = committee clerks, 5 = press and*  
*public\)* Council meetings are held on a monthly basis and may be  
supplemented by youth parliament and other quasi-democratic  
meetings or presentations. For the remainder of the year, the cham-  
ber is available for other potential uses, most of which would not  
require the tiered seating \(see Figure 16.4\) and public galleries  
so common in historic town halls. Rather it favours a flat-floored  
space with flexible furniture, which can then be used for various  
functions or conferences that can be a source of potential revenue  
to the council.  
The character of the civic chamber as a traditional oak-panelled  
room with all the allusions of grandeur attributed to outdated civic  
notions is not something that is prized by forward-looking councils.  
However, allusion to the civic nature of the room can be accommo-  
dated by a modern system of panelling utilised also for its acoustic  
# Civic buildings 16-3  
performance. This space may be renamed. At Brent, for example,  
the civic chamber and its associated meeting and committee rooms  
are known as Conference Hall and Board Rooms.  
**16.4** *Council chamber seating*  
# 1.3 Civic suite  
In support of the civic functions of the council, meeting spaces and  
committee rooms are required in proximity to the civic chamber.  
These are to provide spaces serviced with audio-visual and cater-  
ing for the needs of the council in conducting its business through  
committees. When not required for this use they can be let for com-  
munity/private/corporate use.  
# 1.4 Committee rooms  
Local government business is conducted principally through  
numerous committees and sub-committees. Meeting rooms of  
various sizes are required; these \(including the council chamber\)  
are often available for letting by outside organisations, producing  
useful additional revenue for the council. For this reason, if for no  
other, they should be well designed and fitted out.  
# 1.5 Community hall  
A central feature of the community function of the town hall/civic  
centre is the community hall. This is a space essentially for the use  
of the community but also for corporate events. It might accom-  
modate large-scale weddings, concerts, pantomimes, plays, dances  
and banquets.  
# 1.6 Offices  
These can account for the bulk of accommodation within the town  
hall/civic centre as local authorities consolidate resources and  
departments in order to better deliver public services ‘under one  
roof’. This breaks down the traditional ‘silo’ thinking of separate  
departments to encourage integrated delivery.  
Administration areas within local authorities are now recog-  
nised as being as demanding as commercial office requirements  
\(see Chapter 29\). Smart desking and new ways of working are  
becoming accepted and have benefits in terms of space utilisation  
and efficiency. A ratio of 10 employees per 8 or even 7 desks is  
not unusual.  
Flexible open plan areas with fixed island desking are punc-  
tuated with quiet rooms, breakout spaces, staff storage lockers,  
business support units for printing, recycling, storage and wet sup-  
port areas for tea points.  
# 1.7 Public reception and information  
A large entrance or atrium space is required for the public to  
arrive and orientate. People will be met by ‘meeters and greeters’,  
who will answer any immediate questions and give directions to  
departments as appropriate. A large reception desk is required  
with space for several receptionists, some potentially in wheel-  
chairs, who will receive the public, provide information or  
coordinate meetings.  
# 1.8 Customer services  
Also known in some local authorities as a ‘one-stop shop’, this is  
a large space consisting of a seating/waiting area, queuing system  
and large number of desks manned by council staff to answer que-  
ries and provide information to the public on all matters \(planning,  
building control, council tax, education, social services, leisure\).  
Additionally, a series of rooms for confidential consultations are  
required with alternative staff exits if necessary for security and  
escape reasons.  
# 1.9 Cash facility  
The need for cash transactions is diminishing as more and more  
are dealt with online. Dedicated cashier stations are generally no  
longer required. **16-4 Civic buildings**  
# 1.10 Library  
Public libraries \(Chapter 26\) are often incorporated into town halls/  
civic centres in order to benefit from the proximity with other ser-  
vices and facilities \(Figure 16.5\).  
The nature of the public library has changed to more of an inter-  
net café and indeed many have informal seating and a café facility.  
Books are displayed face-on rather than end-on and study tables  
with Wi-Fi are mixed in. Children’s book areas are linked and not  
separated.  
# 1.11 Events spaces  
With a growing emphasis on mixing up civic and community func-  
tions, the scope for impromptu or even scheduled performance  
events in visible areas within the town hall suggests that reception  
and circulation spaces can double-function as ‘given’ or ‘found’  
spaces for such uses thereby animating the potentially otherwise  
institutional character of this area.  
# 1.12 Case study – Brent Civic Centre  
*Introduction*  
London Borough of Brent commissioned Hopkins Architects to  
design a multi-purpose civic centre on a site close to Wembley  
Stadium. The aim was to house civic, public and administrative  
facilities within one building including office space for 2000 staff.  
It was also conceived as a new community hub for the public to  
meet within the newly landscaped Arena Square. There is also a  
wedding garden for guests attending wedding parties in the com-  
munity hall.  
*Size*  
Brent Civic Centre totals 39683 sqm. Of this, 14154 sqm is public/  
civic space, 18073 sqm administrative and 7456 sqm basement.  
*Layout*  
The building’s spaces are arranged around a 31 m high, natu-  
rally lit foyer and atrium \(Figure 16.6\). This houses a large public  
amphitheatre and wide civic steps as well as the circular civic drum  
containing a multi-purpose, a library \(1211 sqm\), customer services  
centre \(768 sqm\) and 26 m diameter community hall \(1177 sqm\)  
\(Figure 16.7\).  
The chamber \(284 sqm\), on level three, can be reconfigured to  
suit a variety of civic and public uses \(Figure 16.8 a, b, c\). There is  
also an atrium foyer and civic hall lobby \(473 sqm\) and committee  
rooms \(407 sqm\).  
Two glazed office wings provide open plan and flexible admin-  
istrative space to the rear of the site, included at a ratio of 7 seats to  
every 10 staff to reflect anticipated occupancy levels.  
*Building performance*  
Brent Civic Centre has a BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ rating and  
was the first of its building type to have achieved this. As such, it  
attained a 33 per cent reduction in carbon emissions due to a com-  
bination of solar shading, natural ventilation, high-performance  
façade and combined cooling, heating and power.

# 2 LAW COURTS  
# 2.1 Background  
The judicial system of England and Wales is in direct line of  
descent from that established by William I nearly a thousand  
years ago, subsequently modified by Magna Carta and many other  
reforms. Courthouses are the visible manifestation of one of the  
most fundamental sets of principles upon which our society is  
based.  
How this is to be expressed in architectural terms is the particu-  
lar challenge facing the designer of a courthouse. He or she will  
have to consider the contextual and environmental constraints that  
apply to any urban structure, especially those on prominent sites  
in town centres. Planning problems posed by the specific require-  
ments for a courthouse must also be addressed, such as the four  
segregated circulation routes \(for judge, jury, defendant in custody  
and public\), the servicing of the many and varied spaces within a  
complex layout and the need for flexibility to accommodate future  
developments in information technology. Although courtrooms  
built 200 years ago are still able to cope, the law is constantly  
evolving and both the courtrooms and the ancillaries need to be  
receptive to inevitable change. **Civic buildings 16-5**

# 2.2 Court system  
HMCS \(Her Majesty’s Court Service\) has existed in various forms  
for over 900 years. Following the Courts Act 1971, it was given the  
task of running a new system covering all courts above the level of  
Magistrates’ Courts. It is directly responsible for\:  
• Court of Appeal  
• Royal Courts of Justice  
• High Court  
• Crown Court  
• County Court.  
The Crown Court is a national court which sits at different cen-  
tres. Practically all its work is concerned with cases committed for  
trial or sentence from the Magistrates’ Courts, or appeals against  
their decisions. Cases for trial are heard before a judge and jury.  
Centres are classified as first, second or third tier according to the  
nature and complexity of the court business.  
Magistrates’ Courts were traditionally local courts but are  
increasingly organised regionally. Some are part of larger com-  
bined courts such as Newport Law Court, which combines County  
and Magistrates Courts \(Figure 16.9\).  
# 2.3 The courtroom  
The Crown Court sits in a courtroom, the design of which will  
always be subject to the continuous adjustments dictated by  
changes in attitudes to child witnesses, the need to protect wit-  
nesses and jurors from possible intimidation and developments in  
technology.  
The courtroom is the primary workspace and focal point in  
a courthouse, which is developed around it. It is the only place  
where all parties in a case are likely to meet. Of paramount  
importance is the need to segregate judge, jury, defend-  
ant and others in the courtroom and within the courthouse.  
Segregated circulation routes are provided so that the judge,  
jury and defendants \(if in custody\) make their way to the court-  
room without meeting each other or any other users such as  
members of the public.  
The exception is the Magistrates Court in which there is no jury,  
so therefore no need to provide space for jury seating or circulation  
\(see case study in Section 2.15\).  
In all other courts, dedicated entrances are provided for\:  
• Judge  
• Jury  
• Defendants in custody  
• Public, witnesses and defendants on bail.  
Some prosecution witnesses have to be protected from intimida-  
tion; a separate secure waiting room for them is often situated with  
its entrance off the vestibule provided between the public entrance  
and the courtroom itself. An alternative arrangement has a separate  
access from the secure waiting area into the courtroom adjacent to  
the witness box.  
The public enter the court behind or to the side of the public  
seating at the rear of the courtroom; neither public nor witnesses  
pass areas dedicated to other participants \(e.g. jury or defendants in  
custody\) on entering or leaving the courtroom.  
# 2.4 Relationships within the courtroom  
Courtroom layout incorporates specific and well-defined rela-  
tionships between the various participants by means of carefully **16-8 Civic buildings**  
**16.9** *Newport Law Court, in South Wales, designed by Feilden + Mawson, with clear delineation of public, court and court ancillary*  
*zones. Gross internal area\: 9100 m2*  
arranged sightlines, distances and levels. There are four main ele-  
ments in Crown Court cases\:  
• Judge  
• Jury  
• Witness  
• Counsel \(barristers and solicitors\).  
Defendants do not take part except as witnesses. Each element  
must be closely related, and be able to see and hear each other  
clearly at all times without mechanical or electrical aids, and with-  
out excessive turning from side to side. The basic positioning of the  
occupants is shown in Figure 16.10.  
The theory behind these relationships can be summarised as  
follows\:  
• *The judge or magistrate*. Presides over the courtroom, should be  
able to observe the whole of it, to see clearly the principal par-  
ticipants as well as the defendant in the dock and, when called,  
the antecedents and probation officers. The judge or magistrates’  
bench is always elevated, usually by 450 mm \(Figure 16.11\).  
• *The court clerk*. Administers the case and needs to keep a watch-  
ing eye over the court. He or she often advises the judge and  
should be able to stand up and speak to the judge without being  
overheard.  
• *The exhibit table*. This is in front of the counsel benches for the  
display of exhibits put forward for evidence.  
• *Counsel*. These are barristers and solicitors who represent the  
defendant or prosecution. They need to be able to see the jury,  
judge and witness to whom they address their remarks. The bar-  
rister at each end of the front bench should be able to keep every  
jury member and the witness on the stand within about a 90°  
angle to obviate too much turning to ensure that the judge, the  
other main party, shall have at least a part face view. The counsel  
benches are wide enough to hold the large, and numerous, docu-  
ments and books that are often in use.  
• *The defendant*. The defendant is assumed to be innocent until  
proved guilty and current practice is to reduce any prison-like  
appearance of the dock by lowering the barriers enclosing it as  
much as possible compatible with security. Defendants sit in sep-  
arate fixed seats and if they are thought to be a security risk may  
sit in an enclosed glazed cubicle within the court. The dock is con-  
trolled by a dock officer and situated at the back of the courtroom.  
• *The jury*. This comprises 12 members of the public whose duty  
it is to reach a verdict based on the evidence presented. The  
jury sits opposite the witness stand and must be able to see the  
defendant in the dock, as well as the judge and counsel. Jurors  
must have a writing surface and a place to put documents.  
• *The witness*. The witness waits outside the courtroom and when  
called gives evidence from the witness stand near to the judge’s  
bench. They stand facing the jury who must be able to observe his  
or her face. The witness is questioned by the barristers and occa-  
sionally by the judge. If the judge directs that a witness should be  
retained, he or she can wait seated within the courtroom. **Civic buildings 16-9**  
**16.10** *Standard Crown Courtroom*  
**16.11** *Judge’s bench*  
*Source*\: Court Standards Design Guide, Ministry of Justice **16-10 Civic buildings**  
• *The shorthand writer*. This official keeps a transcript of the trial  
and consequently must be able to see and hear everyone who  
speaks.  
• *Probation and antecedents officers*. These give evidence from  
their seats after the jury has reached a verdict. This evidence is  
used to assist the judge in passing sentence.  
• *The press*. These are not party to the proceedings, but they  
should be able to see the participants.  
• *The public*. These are in court to see that ‘justice is done’.  
They are placed at the near end of the courtroom and have  
a general view of the proceedings, but with the minimum  
possible direct eye contact with the jury to reduce the risk  
of intimidation. A public gallery over the jurors is the most  
effective method of eliminating possible intimidation; but  
access to such a gallery and the increase in height of the  
courtroom has to be considered. The glass screen between the  
public and the dock is partially obscured to prevent members  
of the public from seeing the defendant\(s\) \(and vice versa\)  
while seated.  
# 2.5 The courtroom environment  
The design of Crown Court rooms should reflect the quiet dignity  
of the law rather than its power. Guidance was published by the  
Ministry16 of Justice \(Court Standards Design Guide\) in 2010  
and by HM Courts & Tribunals Service in 2019. A fully acces-  
sible \(Figures 16.12, 16.13\), well-detailed, comfortable and quiet  
**16.12** *DDA compliant standard criminal court, 14.4 m × 13.5 m, 172 m2. Source\: Court Standards Design Guide, Ministry of Justice* courtroom with efficient and simply managed ventilation, lighting  
and acoustics is the ideal.  
• *Youth court*. Magistrates’ Courts often contain a court appro-  
priate for juveniles, where magistrates and defendants and legal  
teams can sit around the same table. These courts should have  
their own circulation routes, which can be kept separate to that of  
any other\) courts operational that day in the building.  
• *Ventilation*. Well-balanced environmental conditions within  
the courtroom are essential to the smooth running of the  
court. They keep the participants comfortable and interested,  
and avoid distractions. The current trend, supported by most  
users, is for natural ventilation with openable windows. This  
will subject the courtroom to wider temperature fluctuations;  
but this can be minimised by integrated automatic control  
systems.  
• *Mechanical assistance* \(or in extreme cases full air condition-  
ing\) will be necessary where there would be unacceptable noise  
intrusion; or where the courtroom cannot have the height to  
induce air flow by the natural stack effect. It is normally more  
economical and energy-efficient to have separate air handling  
# Civic buildings 16-11  
units for each courtroom, managed by time switches and occu-  
pancy sensors.  
• *Lighting*. Daylight is provided if possible; but direct sunlight  
must be controlled and security risks avoided. The controlled  
use of daylight alone improves environmental comfort, but when  
it becomes for any reason insufficient, artificial lighting will be  
required. A combination of uplighters and downlighters reduces  
glare and contrast, and enhances the character of the courtroom.  
Lighting levels and colour should ensure correct colour render-  
ing, and that all participants, exhibits and written evidence can  
be clearly seen without strain or dazzle.  
• *Acoustics*. The acoustics and noise levels should ensure that  
the proceedings can be heard in all parts of the courtroom  
while avoiding distraction and annoyance from movement by  
the public, press or others. There may be a need for reflective or  
absorbent surface treatment to walls and ceilings.  
• *Communications.* – The courtroom should accommodate data  
connections and telephones for the legal teams and judiciary,  
with cabling concealed within a raised floor. Screens to show  
testimony from witnesses outside the courtroom should also be  
incorporated.

# 2.6 Functional relationships outside the courtroom  
Courthouse accommodation is divided into areas, each with its  
own self-contained circulation. Movement between areas is limited  
and restricted. Even those who need to move freely can only enter  
certain restricted areas by passing through manned control points  
or other secure doors. The relationship and pattern of movement  
between the elements is shown in the functional relationship dia-  
gram in Figure 16.14.  
# 2.7 Judiciary  
The judiciary \(judges, recorders, etc.\) arrive at the court building  
and enter through a manned or otherwise restricted entry directly  
into their own secure area of the building. This contains the judges’  
retiring rooms and all areas devoted to judicial use.  
The only other users of this area in ‘working hours’ are the staff,  
that is, ushers, court clerks, security staff and invitees \(legal rep-  
resentatives, guests and some members of the public invited to a  
judge’s room\). Invitees will always be escorted, and access for all  
will be either via the judges’ entrance into court or through staff  
areas. Each entrance will be via a self-locking, secure door.  
# 2.8 Jurors  
Persons, the number depending on the number and size of trials  
programmed, are summoned to the court building. They enter  
through the main public areas until they reach the reception area to  
the jury assembly suite where they are booked in.  
They then wait in the lounge or dining area where refreshments  
are available until called upon to form a jury panel. The period  
of waiting is variable and can be all day. Highest usage is before  
courts sit, and during lunch periods.  
Egress from the assembly area, other than back past reception,  
is into jury-restricted circulation, which leads to court and jury  
retiring rooms. These should be adjacent or close to related court-  
rooms, and all capable of supervision by one jury bailiff.  
Once jurors have entered the jury assembly suite, they remain  
there, in court or in the jury retiring room, until sent home at the  
end of the day, or on dismissal.  
# 2.9 Defendants  
The custody area \(see Chapter 16, 3.5\) is a self-contained com-  
partment within the court building designated for the temporary  
use of prison governors in the discharge of their duties to the court  
to produce and retain prisoners in custody. It consists of the fol-  
lowing principal parts, each separate from its neighbour and all  
non-custody uses\:  
• Custody core  
• Vehicle entrance  
• Visitors’ entrance  
• Courtroom entrance  
• Three independent secure connecting routes from custody core  
to vehicle dock, courtroom entrance and visitors’ entrance.  
While courts are sitting, the custody area is staffed and admin-  
istered by prison officers. A principal or senior officer is in charge,  
supported by number of officers according to the number of courts  
and the level of risk. Some officers have fixed duties, for instance  
dock officer and cells officer, but the remainder are on escort duties.  
Custody areas are designed and constructed to contain defend-  
ants, and to produce them to the court. Containment requires the  
meticulous and consistent application of passive security measures.  
Confinement and attendance at court for defendants is stressful, and  
this is compounded by natural frustration and anxiety. The designer  
must\:  
• Give careful attention to all aspects of the design from the over-  
all plan and its approaches, down to fixtures, fittings, fixings,  
finishes, alarms and communications.  
• Devise a layout that will achieve maximum control, make the  
best use of staff resources and maintain an acceptable level of  
safety and security.  
• Use the building fabric and the facilities within it to provide a  
secure envelope.  
• Deny the public direct view or contact with defendants while  
they are inside the custody area, except during authorised visits.  
**16.14** *Functional relationship diagram for a courthouse* **2.10 Public**  
The public areas with their associated circulation form the central  
core or axis from which most non-judicial functions of the court  
building radiate.  
Except for the judiciary and specified car park users, all users  
enter the building by the main entrance door where space and  
facilities for security checks are provided. The arrival concourse  
contains the information/enquiry point and the Cause List display,  
both of which should be clearly seen on entering.  
Public circulation then leads to court waiting areas. These may  
be combined with associated circulation to form concourses off  
which are located the courtrooms and consultation/waiting rooms.  
Waiting areas should be visually interesting, preferably with exter-  
nal views. All furniture should be fixed.  
Public circulation also gives access to private and semi-private  
accommodation occupied by Court Service \(CS\) staff, non-CS staff,  
the Probation Service, custody visits and to refreshment facilities.  
Access must also be available to the Crown Court office counters.  
Direct access from the arrivals concourse to the jury assembly area  
is desirable.  
# 2.11 Advocates  
Advocates enter the court building by the main entrance, reach-  
ing their suite via the public circulation. This is the area reserved  
for solicitors and barristers preparing for court, combining lounge/  
study/retiring room for relaxation and quiet study in comfortable  
conditions, and for assembly, discussion, robing, etc. The lounge  
and robing room should, if possible, be contiguous, otherwise direct  
access should be provided.  
The suite has easy access to courtrooms via the public con-  
course where advocates meet clients, and to the advocates’ dining  
room. The advocates’ clerks’ room is closely related and shares the  
same private ‘advocates’ circulation.  
# 2.12 Crown Court office  
The Crown Court office is occupied by executive and administra-  
tive staff engaged in the general administration of Crown Court  
business.  
The general office counter must be conveniently located to  
allow easy access for the public and for the legal profession; pay-  
ment of expenses to jurors and witnesses may be made here.  
There should be separate circulation to other staff areas and for  
direct access to the judges, and restricted circulation by ushers.  
Within the Crown Court offices, accommodation is provided for  
some more specialised groups\:  
• Court clerks who are responsible for business in specific court-  
rooms and who spend part of their day in court  
• Ushers who spend part of their time in court and attending to  
judge and/or jury but will also do minor clerical work  
• Listing staff who are responsible for the planning and program-  
ming of the court timetable \(lists of cases\).  
# 2.13 Non-courts service users  
Non-courts service users includes police, Crown Prosecution  
Service, Probation Service and shorthand writers, concerned with  
the running of the court.  
The police area consists of two sections\:  
• *The Police Liaison Unit*. This is the suite of offices for police  
staff attached to the courts and providing antecedents, etc.  
Included is a room where police witnesses can assemble and  
change if necessary.  
• *The Police Law and Order Unit*. This suite of offices is for police  
who maintain security or ‘Law and Order’ in the building.  
*The Crown Prosecution Service* is responsible for the prose-  
cution of defendants in court. It needs an office for law clerks to  
# Civic buildings 16-13  
perform casework arising during the progress of the case, and to  
consult with members of the legal profession and witnesses.  
*The Probation Service*, as attached to a Crown Court, will be  
active where persons have been made subjects of probation orders  
or inquiry reports at court, although they may do some paperwork  
on other cases. The probation suite is a separate individual unit  
and, where night reporting facilities are required, must be able to  
operate in isolation while full security to the remainder of the court  
building is maintained.  
*Shorthand writers* are usually hired directly or via a service firm  
to take notes and transcribe court proceedings.  
# 2.14 Catering  
Catering within Crown Courts involves self-service facilities for  
advocates, jurors, public and court staff, together with waiter  
service, from a sideboard or servery for the judiciary. The cater-  
ing area should be sited on one floor with easy access for all  
court users, maximising usage and minimising operating costs.  
Multilevel catering areas should be avoided as less convenient and  
more expensive to operate.  
# 3 CASE STUDY – NORTH SOMERSET  
# COURTHOUSE, WORLE, WESTON-SUPER-MARE  
# ARCHITECT\: BDP  
# 3.1 Introduction  
A new courthouse was required as part of a rationalisation of  
Magistrate Courts in North Somerset. BDP’s brief was to provide  
five courtrooms and associated facilities in a building that embod-  
ied the gravitas of the British legal system. Alongside the court  
building are offices for Avon and Somerset Area Probation Office.  
The project was procured as part of the Avon and Somerset Courts  
PFI Project for HM Courts Service.  
# 3.2 Site  
The greenfield site was an edge-of-town location close to low-rise  
housing and a supermarket.  
# 3.3 Design  
The courthouse is organised as an L-shaped orthogonal block con-  
taining the courtrooms behind a softer, curved form containing the  
court halls. This sweeps around the front of the building to create a  
butterfly shape to give a strong visual identity \(Figure 16.15\).  
The courtrooms are located on the first floor with the custody  
suite on the ground floor. The core challenge was achieving the  
separation of circulation needed for members of the public, the  
judiciary, and the defendants \(Figures 16.16, 16.17a, b and 16.18\).  
At Worle, the public circulation and waiting area is positioned  
to the front of the building served by two staircases. The custody  
suite contains male, female and juvenile cells and associated legal  
and officers’ facilities, control room, van dock and assembly area.  
This suite is served by dedicated stair and lift cores to the court-  
rooms, one to every two courts.  
A number of small interview rooms are positioned off the first  
floor public waiting area as well as toilets and a kitchen. Seating  
is robust and fixed and toilets have low-level lighting to deter  
intravenous drug use. A separate staircase and waiting area is  
provided to segregate accommodation for youth and children’s  
court cases.  
Five courts are positioned to the rear of the building on either  
side of the central magistrates’ and courts staff area. They range  
from approximately 80–100 sqm each. Of these, Court 1 has full  
height security glazing to the dock while Courts 2, 3, 4 have  
half height, non-secure screens. Court 5, as a family court, has  
neither.  
The magistrates’ bench is raised 450 mm at the rear to provide  
security and authority, with separate access for judiciary. The room **16-14 Civic buildings**

ble-height space above the magistrate’s bench.

• *Existing centres are often inadequate*

1 Introduction  
2 Planning and design  
3 Elements of the plan  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Briefing  
By their nature, community buildings must serve a variety of func-  
tions among which are\:  
• Meetings  
• Child care \(crèche, day nursery, pre-school playgroup\)  
• Children’s activities \(scouts, guides\)  
• Concerts and plays  
• Dances  
• Parties and receptions  
• Exhibitions  
• Sporting and leisure activities  
• Adult education.  
The client, such as a church or a local authority, may have its  
own specific requirements; but the financial viability of community  
facilities usually depends on letting them out to other organisations.  
At the briefing and planning stage, it is wise to consider activities  
which could or should be accommodated.  
# 1.2 Space requirement and arrangement  
The following points should be borne in mind\:  
• Meetings can range from committee meetings of half a dozen  
people to public meetings with an audience of a couple of hun-  
dred. If this range is anticipated then accommodation should  
include one or two smaller meeting rooms as well as the main  
hall.  
• Child care and children’s activities invariably require storage for  
furniture and equipment. If Scouts use the facilities on a regular  
basis, for example, they are likely to need permanent storage for  
camping equipment, such as tents and poles, and cooking as well  
as games equipment.  
• Some indoor sporting activities such as badminton require gen-  
erous space provision. See Chapter 37. These are likely to dictate  
the dimensions of the hall.  
**17.1** *Elements of the plan of a community centre*  
# 2.2 Space requirements  
Table I gives recommended floor areas for various functions and  
activities.  
# 2.3 Design  
Community centres are multi-purpose buildings. Needs and priori-  
ties will often conflict; the skill of the designer in consultation with  
the client, statutory authorities and specialists must be exercised so  
that a balance is struck. All the following factors should be con-  
sidered.  
# 2 PLANNING AND DESIGN  
# 2.1 Relationships  
The principal plan elements and their relationship to each other  
illustrated in Figures 17.1, 17.2 and 17.3 are typical examples of  
the type.  
# 2.4 Structure and construction  
Most new-build self-contained community centres are domestic in  
scale. The most economic forms of construction are those used in  
domestic building\: solid ground floors, masonry load-bearing walls  
and lightweight flat roofs or framed pitched roofs. Alternative  
forms of construction are only occasionally justified\: for a diffi-  
cult site or when only a short-life building is required. In the latter  
case, it is worth considering proprietary off-the-peg buildings. The  
appearance of such a building is not always aesthetically pleasing,  
but there are exceptions. Where the community facilities are to be  
accommodated in a larger building also used for other purposes,  
structure and construction will be determined by the wider consid-  
erations.  
# 2.5 Materials and finishes  
For self-contained community centres, it is worthwhile designing  
for minimum maintenance, as upkeep funds are always limited.  
Choice of finishes should be influenced by the following consid-  
erations.  
*Nature of use* may dictate forms of construction and finish  
which are non-standard. For example, when regular pro-  
vision for dancing \(particularly classical ballet\) or indoor  
sport such as badminton or gymnastics is required, the floor  
should provide some resilience and specialist advice should  
be sought.

those of means of escape, so it is important to consult with experts  
and local authorities.

Child care\:  
\(crèche, day nursery,

Regulation  
# 2.6 Means of escape  
Care in planning and signposting the means of escape in case of fire  
is especially important because\:  
• The users, such as audiences at occasional concerts and meetings  
will not be familiar with the building layout.  
• Small children are likely to be present in a crèche or day care  
centre.  
• Elderly and disabled people may use the centre.  
• Facilities for leisure or educational purposes may be used by  
people with learning difficulties.  
• Early consultation with the local fire authority is essential.  
# 2.7 Licensing  
A licence will be required for certain uses and these invariably have  
conditions attached.  
# 2.8 Noise  
A community centre is more likely to generate than to suffer  
from high noise levels. They are commonly used at night and at  
the weekend, and are often situated within residential communi-  
ties. They must therefore be designed to avoid nuisance. Where  
uses take place simultaneously, sound separation will be necessary  
between a noisy activity such as a dance and one requiring relative  
quiet such as a lecture.  
The basic principles of acoustic design should be applied\:  
• Orientation, e.g. location of entrances, exits and windows rela-  
tive to adjoining buildings  
• Layout  
• Shape of rooms  
• Double glazing, only viable in association with mechanical ven-  
tilation  
• Sound-absorbent finishes, balanced with requirements of dura-  
bility and cleanability  
• Landscaping, including trees, to contain external noise.  
Unless unavoidable, noise-producing spaces should not be  
located alongside quiet spaces. Absorbent surfaces may have to  
be concentrated at ceiling level or provided by means of drapes  
and wall hangings. Management can also play a significant part in  
controlling noise and this should be discussed with the client at an  
early stage.  
# 2.9 Security  
Community centres are more than usually vulnerable to break-ins  
and vandalism as they do not have resident caretakers or 24-hour  
surveillance, are not continuously occupied, are visited by a large  
number of people, contain expensive equipment and are isolated  
Staffing ratios  
Outdoor play  
Catering  
Child care for children in their early years \(generally  
defined as under 8\) usually comes within the Children  
Act 1989 \(see Section 3\) and local authorities are  
responsible for approving and registering facilities.  
Many of these authorities provide published  
requirements and guidance on standards  
0–2-year-olds 1\:3  
2–3-year-olds 1\:4  
3–5-year-olds 1\:8  
\(minimum staff 2\)  
A safe area with easy access from the building is a usual  
requirement  
As it is recommended that children and adults  
should sit together during meals, separate dining  
accommodation for staff is not required  
# 2.11 Disabled people  
There are statutory regulations relating to access for disabled  
people. These apply not only to those using wheelchairs but also  
include people with visual and auditory impairments and those  
using other types of walking aids. All these have difficulties with  
steps and changes of direction, and the design of entrances, circula-  
tion spaces and toilets should take this into account.  
# 2.12 Legislation  
This is constantly changing. Table III gives some current examples  
but is not exhaustive. The local authority will advise on the latest  
requirements. It is particularly important to ensure full conformity  
if the public are going to be charged for admission.  
# Table III Legislation  
Licensing Act 2003 Legislation requires that a licence is obtained for premises  
which are to be used, regularly or occasionally for the  
following purposes\:  
• Public music or public music and dancing  
• Public performance of plays  
• Cinematograph exhibitions to which the public are admitted  
on payment  
• Cinematograph exhibitions for children who are members  
of a cinema club  
• Indoor sports entertainment  
Statutory requirements must be satisfied in terms of means of  
escape in case of fire and other safety considerations  
Administered by the local authority  
Covers requirements for premises used by children in, for  
instance, day nurseries, playgroups, crèches, out-of-school  
clubs, holiday play schemes, adventure playgrounds and  
open access projects. Administered by the local authority

Children Act 1989  
# 3 ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN  
# 3.1 Entrance  
This should be large enough to accommodate an influx of people,  
such as prior to a meeting or concert. Signposting should be clear,  
as many will be unfamiliar with the building. Unless there is a sep-  
arate goods entrance, it should allow for bulk delivery of food and **17-4 Community centres**  
drink, display material and equipment. Consider the arrangement  
of the doors, the durability of surfaces and easy accesses to both  
the kitchen and the hall.  
# 3.2 Hall  
For sports purposes refer to Chapter 37. A rectangular shape is  
likely to be suitable for a wider range of uses than a square or any  
other shape. If black-out is required, pay special attention to size  
and location of windows; mechanical ventilation may be needed.  
# 3.3 Meeting rooms  
If more than one, make them different sizes. Alternatively, have  
one space that can be divided using sliding folding doors, although  
some of these do not provide adequate sound insulation. At least  
one meeting room should have direct access to the hall.  
# 3.4 Toilets  
Separate toilets will be needed for men, women and disabled  
people. There may also be a need for smaller toilets for little  
children. Unisex baby-changing facilities should be provided. If  
considerable sports usage is expected, showers will be necessary  
for each sex.  
# 3.5 Kitchen  
There should be little need for more than a domestic kitchen. If  
catered functions are expected, provide space for setting out and  
final preparations.  
# 3.6 Storage  
A separate store should be provided for each main use\:  
• Kitchen  
• Sports  
• Seating and other furniture  
• Crèche/kindergarten  
• Scouts.  
The kitchen store should be directly accessible from the kitchen,  
the others from the hall. Storage space should be as generous as  
space and budget will allow. **18 Data centres**

# 2 DATA CENTRE TYPES  
DCs can be divided into two main typologies based on the owner-  
ship of the data that is stored within them\:  
Owner-occupied DCs are purpose built to serve the needs of the  
company’s operations or services. They are designed and built with  
the owner’s specific requirements in mind, as a priority. Sometimes  
the owner will have its own Basis of Design \(BOD\) or template that  
needs to be followed. The second type, described as colocation,  
refers to a service provided by organisations that offer a shared,  
secure space for enterprise businesses to store hardware related to  
data storage and other equipment. These colocation companies pro-  
vide leasing services to enterprise businesses, and institutions, and  
so forth, and offer a large selection of computing power and storage  
requirements. The leased space can be subdivided into different  
zones.  
For moderate storage needs, sometimes known as ‘retail’,  
Figure 18.1, the data halls are typically subdivided into small areas,  
with a moderate number of racks in each and separated by secure  
cages. These subdivisions are adaptable to client requirements.  
A single client may also be able to lease a complete data hall,  
without the need for subdivisions, or whole building. This can be  
referred to as large footprint, Figure 18.2, or hyperscale DC and  
provides support to large clients with specific needs.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Definition  
A data centre \(DC\) is defined as ‘a large group of networked computer  
servers, typically used by organisations for the remote storage, pro-  
cessing or distribution of large amounts of data’ \(Oxford Advanced  
Learner’s Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2020\). Therefore, a  
DC is, fundamentally, a container of digital data. This data is usu-  
ally stored in servers that are housed alongside networking devices,  
cables and other DC computing equipment in a type of physical steel  
and electronic framework known as a rack. These racks are usually  
modular, with typical dimensions of 600 × 1200 × 2000 mm. The  
array of long, evenly spaced rows, flanked by winking lights, is easily  
recognised as the quintessential image of a data hall, an integral part  
of the infrastructure of modern society.  
The first purpose built rooms for computers date back to the  
1960s, and in the 1990s servers started being installed within stan-  
dalone buildings. Today DC campuses can occupy an area of up to  
four football pitches and can include replication both within a site  
and across a number of sites.  
# 1.2 Characteristics  
All the included electronic equipment creates three characteristics  
that drive the design of the DC building\:  
**18.1** *Typical ‘retail’ data centre layout*  
• It needs a clean, uninterrupted flow of energy to avoid data loss  
• It creates a large amount of heat, which needs to be dissipated  
• It requires a robust data network infrastructure to connect to,  
whether that be cabled or satellite.  
In addition, the stored information within these facilities is usu-  
ally of great value and consequently, the security needs are high  
compared to other building typologies. A DC can be placed in any  
location throughout the globe, and can utilise existing buildings or  
be newly constructed to serve specific client needs.  
DCs are highly efficient, continuously occupied buildings that  
have a large power demand. Energy efficient MEP \(mechanical,  
electrical and plumbing\) solutions can drive the design of the  
building and the location of the site. Due to the importance of pro-  
viding an uninterrupted service, DC buildings are usually grouped  
together to provide resilience.

# 3 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN  
# 3.1 Basis of design  
The BOD, often provided by the client contains the basic design  
parameters for the DC and describes specific requirements for cer-  
tain types of user. Understanding the BOD and its compatibility  
with local code compliance, and following best practice, is crucial  
for delivering a DC that responds robustly to the ever-increasing  
demands of DC storage globally.  
# 3.2 Site evaluation  
When a potential site is being evaluated as a viable location for  
a DC, the main criteria taken into consideration includes ground  
conditions, transport accessibility, electrical power source relia-  
bility and infrastructure connectivity \(satellite and fibre\). In some  
countries, the main electrical grid may not be reliable, requiring  
generators to become the main source of energy. Equally, if there is  
no fibre connection, or the connection is not fast enough, a satellite  
connection may be preferred.  
The initial stage of a project is to prepare a series of test fits  
in order to arrange all the component parts within the site bound-  
ary, aligned to any planning constraints. Logistics planning for  
goods, plant and deliveries within a secure facility can be chal-  
lenging, since road widths, distances between main buildings and  
secure fence lines overlaid with accessible infrastructure pathways  
becomes a complex web, Figure 18.3. In addition, placement of  
the adjacent mechanical and electrical plant, substation and sup-  
porting equipment compounds can be influenced by neighbouring  
property, wind, ground conditions and site utility intake locations.  
The scope and scale of these plant areas will depend on the pre-  
ferred MEP strategy and, ultimately, the outcome of this task will  
require confirmation by CFD simulation \(Computational Fluid  
Dynamics\) that the positions of the exhaust air intakes for the dif-  
ferent MEP elements are far enough apart to avoid re-entrainment,  
Figure 18.4.  
Adaptability of the building and services to the growing needs  
of the industry can also be a requirement under phased develop-  
ment principles during these early stages of the project.  
# 3.3 Local regulations  
The typology of DCs is not always recognised within the plan-  
ning application categories. The closest building type is usually  
**18.3** *Data centre infrastructure*  
**18.4** *Data centre site components*  
industrial, however the number of building users is often  
much lower than that found within in a manufacturing facil-  
ity. Data centres will require fewer car parking spaces, while  
imposed landscaping requirements can breach security needs  
or affect plant function. Building envelopes have more diverse  
performance criteria and gross external plant areas can be con-  
siderably larger as a percentage comparison. Early engagement  
and clear communication with the Local Authorities is therefore  
crucial to obtain mutual understanding of the particularities of  
the typology.  
# 3.4 Envelope design  
Key points that need to be taken under consideration during the  
early stages of the DC shell design are as follows\:  
• Façade response to climate and aesthetic requirements  
• Weatherproofing  
• Blast and fire resistance  
• Building phasing  
• Façade demountability.  
# 3.5 Layers of security  
Security is one of the most important aspects in the design of the  
DC. As such, a security layering strategy is usually implemented,  
with the data hall itself at the core. The first security level thresh-  
old would be located at the site entrance \(gatehouse\), the second,  
in the entrance to the DC building, and from that point, additional  
zones are defined by access controls, as we approach the core. The  
exact number, disposition, geometry of these layers and the nature  
of the security thresholds are usually defined by the client’s secu-  
rity team.  
# 3.6 Design considerations  
Structural grids are usually scaled up from the basic unit, the racks  
themselves. Fixed rack layout assists with coordination between  
structural and architectural elements, Figure 18.5. Of equal impor-  
tance, is the provision of area for building expansion. Slab-to-slab  
height in the data halls is dependent on the cooling strategy and the  
building services distribution requirements. The cooling strategy  
may be executed from under a raised access floor, directly from the  
sides and into the rack aisles \(creating hot and cold aisles\), or some  
alternative strategy.  
The roof of the DC building can be used to place cooling equip-  
ment. Cooling strategies that are able to effectively handle the  
enormous amount of heat created from the racks often result in  
additional load capacity requirements. The design must consider  
the size of the mechanical elements, their placement within the  
facility and appropriate maintenance.  
Data hall façades should be provided with removable panels  
that allow easy access to the inside of rack areas. Fragile elec-  
tronic equipment should be housed within sealed zones, with a rain  
removal strategy and dust protection to be implemented utilising  
high-quality material finishes throughout, Figure 18.6.  
# 3.7 Adjacencies  
Adjacencies and room sizes present a starting point from which  
designers should instigate the distribution of space. Figure 18.7  
provides an explanation of interfaces between the entrance, staff  
accommodation, customer care, shipping, receiving areas and data  
storage areas.  
Levels of security vary between rooms, and access routes  
for people and equipment are important to resolve in the early  
stages of DC design. Width and height of doors and corridors is  
determined by the dimensions of the server cabinets. DC layout  
and security division is highly affected by the logistics route,  
Figure 18.8. The importance of the position of the loading dock  
has to be included in the early stages of the space distribution  
layout. **Data centres 18-3**

**18.6** *Typical data centre components*  
# 4 STRUCTURE  
# 4.1 Purpose  
DCs are functional buildings with a low occupancy. The main  
purpose of the structure is to support the floors and building enve-  
lope as efficiently as possible with minimal impact to the layouts.  
Speed and programme, both in the design and construction phases,  
are usually significant drivers for clients. The key challenge for  
the structural team is to design an efficient structure which is well  
co-ordinated with the MEP services.  
# 4.2 Data centre forms  
DC buildings are typically low-rise as they tend to be located in  
semi-industrial areas, where it is cheaper to purchase additional land  
than to construct multiple storeys to achieve a given floor area. Typical  
DCs have one or two storeys with ground-bearing ground floor slabs,  
where ground conditions permit. Where ground conditions are poor,  
ground slabs are suspended from a grid of piled foundations at close  
centres. However, trends towards locating DCs at the edges of towns  
or cities may lead towards taller, multi-storey DCs in the future.  
# 4.3 Choice of material  
The choice between a steel or concrete frame will likely be driven  
by local practices. In-situ frames are not a typical solution as they  
are characteristically slow to construct. Steel-framed solutions  
incorporating composite floor slabs are a preferred solution within  
the UK and northern Europe, due to the speed of site construction  
and the maturity of the steel industries in these countries. Precast  
solutions, incorporating precast beams/columns and hollow core or  
T-section slabs with a structural topping, are more common among  
other global locations. Concrete options, particularly precast **18-4 Data centres**  
**18.7** *Data centre room adjacencies*  
**18.8** *Data centre logistic routes*  
concrete, which typically has a higher cement content than in-situ  
concrete, will likely contain significantly higher embodied carbon  
than a steel-framed option.  
# 4.4 Stability  
DCs do not tend to lend themselves to having stability cores, as is  
typical in commercial or residential buildings, for example. This is  
because stairs and lifts are fewer in number and are small in size  
compared to the plan size of the floor plates. Stability is typically pro-  
vided by braced bays in steel-framed construction or by reinforced  
concrete walls in precast construction. Stability elements should  
be placed towards the centre of floor plates to minimise strains and  
shrinkage of floor slabs. A symmetrical arrangement of stability is key  
for buildings in seismic regions. Large floor plates will require move-  
ment joints to split the building up into lengths of around 80–100 m  
maximum to limit movements due to shrinkage and thermal effects. **Data centres 18-5**  
# 4.5 Column grids  
Maximising the usable floor space within a data hall is a key design  
consideration for a DC. Columns cause disruption to rack layouts  
and each column may mean the loss of a cabinet position. Some  
common examples of structural grids are 9.6 m × 9.6 m or 7.2 m ×  
12 m for multi-storey data centres. However, longer spans are  
preferred by some clients to reduce the impact on cabinet layouts.  
Single-storey DCs without roof plant typically also have longer  
spans.  
Grids are usually a multiple of 600 mm as this is the grid of  
a typical raised floor system or ceiling tile. Longer spans will  
necessitate deeper beams or trusses, which may increase the sto-  
rey height unless service routes can be designed to pass through  
beam web openings, or between truss diagonals. For shorter  
spans, the services zone is usually located below the structure  
to allow for greater flexibility of the positioning and routing of  
these services. Some DCs incorporate a lightweight suspended  
services support grid below the main services to support cabling  
for the server cabinets. There is often scope to adjust the col-  
umn grid within the administration or front-of-house areas as  
the layouts are not governed by the regular grid of the data halls.  
Floor levels within these areas may also be adjusted to allow an  
additional floor, as the floor to ceiling height required is smaller  
– 4 m typically as opposed to 6 m or more required in the data  
halls.  
# 4.6 Floor loading  
DC loads are very high – some typical values are provided in  
Table I. The loading for data halls is governed by the weight and  
density of the server cabinets with some additional allowance for  
personnel access loads. The density of suspended services at ceil-  
ing level is also high, with typical allowances varying between  
1.5 kN/m2 in data halls to 2.4 kN/m2 along corridors where services  
routes are concentrated. DCs that are water-cooled can have par-  
ticularly high services loads from heavy water-filled pipes. Point  
loads may be governing for the design of thin concrete slabs in  
composite construction.  
# 5 RESILIENCE  
# 5.1 Concepts  
Resilience and redundancy are key concepts that are critical for the  
design and deployment of DC infrastructure. Resilience is defined  
as the ability to recover from a fault or equipment failure, mini-  
mising or avoiding any downtime to the system. Redundancy, on  
the other hand, is defined as the intentional duplication of system  
components in order to minimise or avoid any disruption to opera-  
tion, therefore improving resilience. These concepts are commonly  
applied to all disciplines to achieve the level of continuity desired  
for the specific DC type required.  
# 5.2 Definitions  
Within the following section, the different redundancy typologies  
will be explained and therefore it is important to define how they  
are referenced. Generally, the term N is used to define the mini-  
mum amount of equipment or components required for the system  
to operate, Figure 18.9. Based on this, the definition of the follow-  
ing redundancy typologies is\:  
• N\: the system consists of one component of each type with no  
redundancy. In this case, the system only provides power via one  
path to the load. There is a single point of failure \(SPOF\) on the  
final load being supplied.  
# 4.7 Vibration  
Response factor is a consideration for DC floors, although this  
does not tend to be a governing factor. Vibration limits for data  
communication equipment varies between items and values pre-  
sented in different ways, and by different manufacturers. The  
ASHRAE publication *Structural and Vibration Guidelines for*  
*Datacom Equipment Centres* \(2008\) suggests 0.07 g is a typical  
maximum level of operational vibration encountered in a data cen-  
tre. Response factors of R = 4 are typically targeted in line with  
workshop limits. Low levels of fit-out with infrequent partitions  
mean that critical damping may be as low as 1.5 per cent for steel-  
framed construction.

There is no SPOF on the final load being supplied.  
• N+1 Distributed redundant\: System provides power via two  
separate paths to the loads. There is no SPOF on the final load,  
system configuration shares load across different power systems.  
# 5.3 Tier ratings  
When defining the system resilience of a DC, tier ratings are com-  
monly used within the industry. DC tiers provide a framework  
used to describe specific kinds of DC infrastructure in a consist-  
ent way, Table II. Tier 1 is the simplest infrastructure, while Tier  
4 is the most complex and has the most redundant components.  
Each tier includes the required components of all the tiers below it.  
Typically, colocation or enterprise DCs tend to fall under the Tier  
III category.  
# 6 MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT  
# 6.1 Introduction  
This section explains the basic principles of the mechanical systems  
present in a DC. One of the main purposes of a DC is to maintain  
the optimal environmental conditions required for the operation of  
the IT equipment within it. These are commonly temperature and  
humidity. In the majority of DCs, these systems are expected to  
operate continuously and reliably to guarantee the operation of the  
IT infrastructure.  
To achieve this, the mechanical system is required to remove  
the heat produced by the IT equipment, transferring it to a heat  
sink \(typically the atmosphere\) and ensuring that the air is clean  
and with the correct level of humidity for the specific equipment  
characteristics. The ventilation system is in charge of extracting  
and supplying fresh air to the data halls, controlling the humidity  
levels and filtering any particles that could damage the equipment.  
The cooling system of a DC can be split into two different sections  
of data hall cooling and the heat rejection system, as described in  
the following sections.  
# 6.2 Data hall cooling  
The data hall is the main area where the IT equipment is installed  
and operated. Within these areas, cold air is commonly used to  
cool down the servers and other ancillary equipment. This cold air  
would be blown from an air-conditioning unit into the area where  
the servers are located. The most typical types of air-conditioning  
units are\:  
• CRAC – computer room air-conditioning  
• CRAH – computer room air handler  
• Fan Walls – a type of CRAH, usually offering larger cooling  
capacities  
• In-row cooler – air-conditioning system placed between the  
server cabinets offering a more direct and effective solution, and  
handling higher power densities.  
Once cold air leaves the air-conditioning units, it is either chan-  
nelled using a pressurised floor void system or simply blown  
straight into the IT equipment. After passing through the serv-  
ers, this air rises in temperature, so it is extremely important  
that it return immediately to the air-conditioning unit for cool-  
ing. This process is repeated, continuously forming a cycle. In  
Figure 18.10, two typical data hall cooling arrangements are  
presented. It is very common for these rooms to use air con-  
tainment systems to segregate the cold and hot areas to prevent  
undesired recirculation. This allows the heat exchange process to

reducing running costs of the cooling infrastructure. The two air  
containment systems are\:  
• HAC\: hot aisle containment, where hot server exhaust air is con-  
tained, returning to the air-conditioning units via a plenum. In  
this configuration the common server room areas are generally  
colder as the heat is channelled straight back into the air-condi-  
tioning units.  
• CAC\: cold aisle containment, where the cool air from the  
air-conditioning units is contained and directed straight into the  
IT equipment. In this configuration, the common server room  
areas are generally hotter as the heat is exhausted into the server  
room instead of channelled straight back into the air-condition-  
ing units.  
# 6.3 Heat rejection system  
Once the server heat is removed from the server room, it must be  
rejected to a heat sink. The most typical heat sink is the atmos-  
phere; however other choices are available, such as water or the  
ground. In order to do so, the heat rejection equipment must be  
located externally. The preferred location is the roof area of the  
facility; however, if roof areas are not available due to planning  
restrictions, plant can be located to the side of main DC. The heat  
rejection process is carried out by using heat exchangers. These  
devices transfer heat between two or more fluids. Heat travels by  
conduction through the exchanger materials which separate the  
fluids being utilised. Heat flows from hot to cold elements and in  
the particular case of the DC, the hot fluid coming from the server  
room \(either air, water or any other refrigerant\) would transfer the  
# Data centres 18-7  
heat into the cooler air located outside the facility. Some examples  
of equipment used for heat rejection are chillers, cooling towers,  
direct air coolers and air handing units. In a DC, the main systems  
used to facilitate the passage of heat from the server room to the  
heat rejection system are\:  
• Air based system – using a ductwork system to route the hot air  
from the server room into the external heat rejection plant sys-  
tem. This air is moved by fans.  
• Water or refrigerant based system – using a pipework system to  
get the warm water or refrigerant coming from the server room  
into the external heat rejection plant system. These liquids are  
moved by a pumping system.  
# 7 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS  
# 7.1 System types  
Another key purpose of a DC is to provide sufficient power for  
the IT equipment to operate continuously. Similarly, to the cool-  
ing systems, these systems are expected to operate reliably without  
interruption to avoid any downtime in the IT infrastructure. Within  
the following sections, the basic principles of the electrical systems  
present in a DC will be explained. The electrical systems within a  
DC can be subdivided into the following\:  
• Transformers  
• Back-up generators  
• UPS and energy storage  
• Power distribution.  
**18.10** *Data hall cooling arrangements* **18-8 Data centres**  
# 7.2 Transformers  
In a DC, like any other building typology, the main power is pro-  
vided by the local distribution operator via their network, which  
can operate at different voltage levels\:  
• Extra high voltage \(\>230 kV\)  
• High voltage \(35 kV-230 kV\)  
• Medium voltage \(1 kV-35 kV\)  
• Low voltage \(\<1 kV\).  
Depending on the local voltage, it is often required to transform it  
to a suitable level for either its distribution within the facility, or  
directly power the end IT equipment. Power transformers are used  
to convert the electricity to the desired voltage and would usually  
be located in dedicated substations, either externally or internally.  
These come in different sizes depending on the power and voltage  
requirements.  
# 7.3 Back-up generators  
Due to the requirement for continuous power, DCs demand  
auxiliary back-up systems that allow the IT equipment to run con-  
tinuously, even if the utility power is lost. The reliability of utility  
companies vary dependent on specific location, and therefore it is  
essential for a DC to be provided with a resilient back-up system  
that can take over the load. The most common back-up systems are\:  
• Diesel generators  
• Gas generators  
• DRUPS \(Diesel rotary uninterruptable supplies\).  
# 7.4 Uninterruptible power supply \(UPS\)  
Despite generators providing full back-up to the installed load  
within the facility, these can normally take some time to become  
online. This means that for a short period of time, between the tran-  
sition from utility to generators, the load would lose power. To  
mitigate this, UPS are commonly used in DCs. UPS is a type of  
equipment that provides power continuously without downtime,  
relying on batteries to power the load when the mains power has  
failed. This is achieved by using extremely fast auto-changeover  
systems, ensuring that the transition from utility to battery supply is  
quick enough to be unnoticeable for the IT systems \(milliseconds\).  
In addition to this, the units condition the incoming power filtering  
any voltage or frequency deviations that could affect the operation  
of the final load, providing clean uninterrupted power.  
# 7.5 Power distribution  
From the point where the facility connects to the utility network to  
the final circuits powering the racks, the system is subdivided into  
different steps that distribute the power throughout the DC. This  
is normally achieved by introducing electrical panels \(also known  
as switchboards\) that will allow the power to be shared between  
multiple systems. These switchboards will power the mechanical  
and IT systems, as depicted in Figure 18.11, by either using cabling  
or busbars to transport the energy down into the system. The power  
distribution within the server rooms is normally provided by the  
following equipment\:  
• PDU \(power distribution unit\) – a device similar to a distribution  
board used to power the IT equipment within the server room.  
These are provided with special metering systems that allow cus-  
tomer billing and energy monitoring.  
• Busway system – a prefabricated electrical distribution system  
consisting of busbars in a protective enclosure, running at high  
level within the rack aisles. It is common that servers are pro-  
vided with dual power supplies, using diverse routes to ensure  
full power redundancy.  
# 8 IT SYSTEMS  
Connectivity with wider telecommunications infrastructure is a  
significant aspect of the DC facility comparable to the MEP sys-  
tems. The IT system infrastructure design needs to be prudently  
designed to provide the right level of resilience and redundancy  
to the data transported to the servers. To achieve this, dual and  
diverse networks are usually required, Figure 18.12. Commonly  
within DCs, the following elements can be identified \(note that  
these terms and topologies vary depending on the different type of  
facilities and clients\)\:  
• Incoming telecommunications – the point at which the external  
networks enter the site wide telecoms network.  
• Zero vault – the point at which the external telecoms network  
enter the DC building.  
• PoE \(Point of Entry\) or entrance facility – this is usually a room  
and is where the point of transition between external grade and  
internal grade cabling occurs.  
• Fibre room – the space used to facilitate the interconnection  
of different service providers as well as network distribution  
throughout the facility.  
• MMR \(Meet-me-room\) – the space where interconnection equip-  
ment is housed. This is also used to facilitate the interconnection  
of different service providers.  
• IR \(Infrastructure room\) – the space where landlord IT equipment  
is housed to support the internal infrastructure required to run the  
facility such as Building Management System, Environmental  
Monitoring System, security, corporate network, and so forth.  
# 9 HANDLING AND EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE  
Within critical facilities, where business continuity is an essential  
factor to be considered for its design and operation, the replace-  
ment and maintenance of the equipment and their component parts  
**18.11** *Typical electrical distribution* **18.12** *Typical IT network typology* must be carefully planned. This should allow for all the appropriate  
health and safety measures to ensure personnel safety is not com-  
promised. All equipment must be positioned so it can be replaced  
relatively easily upon either failure or due to end of life. This pro-  
cess should be planned by producing a plant replacement strategy,  
establishing the requirements, routes and procedures to be used to  
enable the equipment removal, Figure 18.13.  
Equipment, during the course of its life, requires periodi-  
cal maintenance to ensure its durability and correct operation.  
To ensure this, equipment must be positioned respecting man-  
ufacturers’ access, clearance requirements and aligned with  
the respective local code requirements. This will allow equip-  
ment to be accessed comfortably by the relevant technical  
staff, increasing the health and safety and overall operation of  
the facility. Due to phasing and expansion in DCs, the facility  
must be afforded the means of installing equipment post-build-  
ing completion, as not all equipment and infrastructure will be  
required from Day 1. The DC must be provided with alternative  
ways of having an operational building while the contractor is  
expanding its infrastructure. This should be achieved without  
mutual interference.  
Lastly, one of the latest trends in the industry is the off-site man-  
ufacture of modularised systems. This is effectively the process of  
creating complete systems integrated into a single platform that can  
be manufactured away from site \(in an improved health and safety  
environment\) ready to be installed in the facility with minimal  
on-site integration, providing programme improvements as well as  
increased on-site health and safety.  
# 10 SECURITY  
# 10.1 Aim  
Today, these facilities are considered as critical national infra-  
structure components due to the prevalence of cloud computing,  
outsourced IT provisions by organisations and government, and  
the adoption of internet-based communication and social media by  
the general public. Security of the facilities and the information  
held within them, is therefore, vital to the operation of ensure ser-  
vice continuity. Service-level agreements, and various regulations  
such as GDPR, and those set by the location country’s Information  
Commissioners are to be adhered to. All DC security design should  
be risk-led and aim at ensuring that the principles of ‘deter, delay,  
detect and detain’ are achieved when planning the facility. Not  
all of these can be implemented as part of the design of the built  
environment, as operational measures will be required. It is vital  
that the design be aligned with the operations and that the design  
team work closely with the client operation and security teams to  
ensure this.  
**18.13** *Transformer replacement example*  
# Data centres 18-9  
# 10.2 Security zones  
To implement the principles, it is important that the facility be  
divided into security zones. These may align with operational and  
functional zones. Complete physical segregation can be used, or  
an overlap, which means electronic security is applied to enforce  
movement controls on portals on boundary transitions. The funda-  
mental aim is to prevent unauthorised access to information, the  
systems managing information and the supporting MEP infrastruc-  
ture, which could disrupt the service. DCs provide a wide range  
of services which require different levels of segregation to be pro-  
vided within the ‘white space’, depending upon the service being  
provided. Typically, the site can be divided into up to five security  
zones, the criticality of the function increasing with the zone num-  
ber, as shown in Figure 18.14, thus adopting an onion layer effect  
and increasing levels of security.  
Security considerations must start at the point of site selection  
and orientation to ensure that critical functions are not located in vul-  
nerable positions and access to the facility is controlled, Table III.  
Zone 1 is considered semi-public and the measures should deter and  
detect unauthorised access by providing a secure boundary to peo-  
ple and vehicles. This will require clear margins to be established  
on both sides of the boundary and minimum clearances between the  
boundary and the facilities. Entrances into the site should be kept  
to a minimum and may require significant space and organisation  
subject to the client requirements. Figure 18.15 shows a complex  
entry-exit arrangement. It is important that as a minimum, it is  
possible to hold vehicles outside of the site boundary, check their  
credentials and reject them without them gaining access to the site.  
# 10.3 Segregation  
Once inside the site, segregation is required between technical areas  
and those accessible to visitors and staff. Access to these areas and  
the operational areas should be controlled and not accessible to vis-  
itors. All people accessing Zone 3 should be fully accredited and  
passed through a control point that ensures this. Other areas that  
required special consideration are\:  
• Secure stores  
• Security operational control room  
• Security equipment room  
• Unloading and goods receipt area  
• MMRs  
• Destruction/ shredding facilities  
• White space/data halls.  
Details of the zones they fall in are outlined in the zoning table,  
Table IV and in Figure 18.16. These areas should be discussed with

# 11 FIRE PROTECTION  
DCs, like other buildings in the UK, must comply with the life  
safety requirements defined in Part B of Building Regulations.  
However, DCs are highly valuable assets and therefore, property  
protection and business continuity must also be considered as part  
of the fire strategy design. With regard to life safety, the guidance  
in Approved Document B or BS 9999 Fire safety in the design,  
management and use of building – Code of practice is considered  
appropriate in order to define\:  
• Detection and alarm provisions  
• Means of escape  
• Internal fire spread due lining materials

• Fire compartmentation • Structural fire resistance • External fire spread to adjoining buildings or properties • Fire brigade access and facilities. BS 9999 is commonly used in the design of DCs as it provides  
greater degree of flexibility, for example on the definition of maxi-  
mum travel distances. Some key considerations that must be given  
to the design of DCs regarding fire safety are\: • Design of DC ventilation systems and their impact on detection  
and/or fire suppression  
• Provision of high-risk areas and equipment such as generators  
and associated diesel storage, high voltage equipment and bat-  
tery storage  
• Conflicts between security and fire safety \(e.g. secured access  
failing safe on fire detection, available access points for fire bri-  
gade intervention\).  
In addition to the measures in the selected fire safety guidance doc-  
ument, the following are typically requested by clients to fulfil the  
property protection and business continuity goals\:  
• Automatic detection and alarm  
• Automatic fire suppression \(sprinklers, water mist or gas suppression\)  
# Data centres 18-11  
• Additional fire compartmentation leading to smaller fire  
compartments  
• Use of non-combustible materials.  
In addition to in country code compliance, all DC providers will  
have additional insurance requirements in relation to property  
protection.

# 1 FIRE STATIONS  
# 1.1 Introduction  
Fire stations must accommodate firefighting appliances and their  
crew to enable them to carry out their duties efficiently as set by the  
national, regional and metropolitan authorities that manage the fire  
and rescue services.  
Each Fire and Rescue Authority will have a detailed brief for the  
design of new fire stations including retained fire stations. Full time  
firefighters typically work a 48-hour shift system over eight days.  
Retained firefighters work a Retained Duty System and may have full  
time employment outside the fire service. The Retained Duty System  
requires the firefighters to live and work close to the fire station they  
serve. Full time firefighters operate a duty system of four watches of  
equal numbers identified by colours which work in sequence – RED,  
BLUE, GREEN and WHITE. Each 24 hours consists of a day duty  
and a night duty to cover the whole period. Each watch works two  
consecutive day duties, rests the next day and then works two consec-  
utive night duties. The watch then has four days off duty. There are  
‘stand easy’ intervals throughout the watch periods. The following is  
a guide for the design of a full time community fire station.  
# 1.2 Planning  
Fire stations are unique buildings and are ‘Sui Generis’ in planning  
terms. Their location will be determined by the attendance times  
that the fire and rescue service are required to meet within their  
‘fire ground’. The activities of training and appliances turning out  
to answer emergency calls can cause nuisance to neighbours by  
noise, vibration and external lighting. This nuisance may need to  
be mitigated either by the design of the site or by management of  
these activities.  
Radio and wireless communication is a vital part of the ser-  
vice’s infrastructure and there must be good reception at the site. If  
the station is close to residential properties care must be taken that  
the position of the drill tower does not interfere with residents’ TV  
reception.  
# 1.3 Egress/turnout  
In an emergency, the primary consideration is to get the fire fighting  
appliance onto the road quickly. A workable vehicular circulation  
pattern is therefore fundamental to the success of the station design,  
Figure 19.1. The turnout route of each appliance should not be  
interrupted by other traffic or returning appliances and maximum  
visibility is required. Appliances must be able to turn out without  
crossing the crown of the road. A forecourt will normally be nec-  
essary to achieve this.  
A forecourt of 9 m depth will allow appliances to pull clear of  
the bay doors and turn out onto the highway without crossing the  
crown of the road. With this depth of forecourt, a clear sightline  
to the edges of the site should be possible from a line 5 m back  
from the pavement. On restricted sites, the forecourt may have to  
be reduced in depth or even omitted altogether. The vehicle turning  
circles illustrated in Figure 19.2 indicate the critical space require-  
ments.  
# 1.4 Ingress/return  
The returning appliances should be able to navigate a clear sweep-  
ing approach from the return access to the covered wash-down  
area, stopping on the centre line of its respective appliance bay.  
# 1.5 Appliances and their appliance bays  
Fire and rescue services deploy various appliances which under-  
take specific tasks. Such appliances include urban search and  
rescue units, water tanker and bulk foam units, command support  
and incident response units. The fire rescue unit \(Figure 19.3\) is  
an important strategic appliance. The most common appliances  
are pumps, pump ladders \(Figure 19.4\) and aerial ladder platforms  
\(Figure 19.5\). As well as accommodating the turnout and return  
sweep of these vehicles, the appliance bays must allow sufficient  
working space for their maintenance and re-equipment. Some  
appliances have equipment trays that extend up to 1300 mm from  
the sides of the vehicles.  
A single appliance bay 15 m deep and 6.5 m wide will accom-  
modate any appliance that the fire and rescue services currently  
deploy. Multiple appliance bays need a width of 5.5 m as the appli-  
ances can share the working space between them. Doors should  
give a clear width of 4.2 m and a clear height of 4.2 m. Doors  
are operated on electric controls with photo electric cells and close  
automatically after the appliance has left \(Figure 19.6\).  
# 1.6 The station building  
Rooms and areas of a community fire station can be grouped into  
six main categories\:  
1 *Operational* – rooms and spaces that are essential to the opera-  
tional readiness and performance of the service  
2 *Training* – spaces that contribute to the firefighters’ skill and  
professionalism acquired through regular training  
3 *Control and administration* – accommodation for the station’s  
communications, administrative duties, incident records and  
public advisory duties  
4 *Amenity* – accommodation for ancillary support activities  
5 *Services* – provision for engineering plant and controls

6 *Community engagement* – rooms where emergency services  
can meet with residents and businesses and advise on fire risk,  
smoke detectors, extinguishers etc. Local communities can also  
use this facility for local community purposes.  
Table I gives recommended areas for two, three and four bay sta-  
tions.  
Security is vital, as the station will be unstaffed when all fire-  
fighters are attending calls. All external doors and all doors off  
appliance bays should be able to be locked. The community facili-  
ties must be separate from the rest of the station and be accessible  
without compromising the station’s security. The station office  
should oversee the appliance bays, the reception area and the fore-  
court.  
All finishes, fixtures and fittings must be robust, easy to clean  
and be easily maintained. Figure 19.7 shows the necessary relation-  
ships for the rooms detailed in Table I.  
Other rooms may be accommodated within a fire station build-  
ing depending on the fire and rescue service’s strategic planning.  
Such rooms include fire safety office, borough manager’s office,  
fire investigation offices and so forth.  
Firefighters will descend to the appliance bays either via a stair-  
case or the pole house. Pole drops are always of one storey only.  
For descents of more than one storey, the pole house will discharge **19-4 Emergency services**

onto a landing and the firefighter will then enter a second pole drop  
for a further storey. A diagram of a typical pole house is shown in  
Figure 19.8.  
# 1.7 Training facilities  
Firefighters will acquire their skills at specialist training centres.  
The maintaining and improvement of existing skills is carried out  
at the fire station, space permitting. The yard should be able to  
accommodate a deep lift pit \(underground water tank\) and a road  
traffic collision \(RTC\) area of at least 30 m2 for training purposes.  
The configuration of the training tower will depend on the local  
requirements. Standard training towers are typically 5–6 storeys  
high. A three-storey training tower with training roof is a suitable  
alternative where planning constraints limit the height of buildings.  
Training lectures are given in the lecture room and the gym  
provides for maintaining physical fitness. The training tower illus-  
trated in Figure 19.9 allows a 135 \(13.5 m\) ladder to be pitched to  
the third floor opening. The upper storeys allow training scenarios  
for aerial ladder platforms.  
# 1.8 Staffing  
The fire station is staffed by the station manager and the watch  
members. Each watch comprises a watch manager and the crews  
for each of the appliances. As there are four watches, there must be  
four sets of fire gear and four lockers per watch member. The watch  
strength will depend on the types of appliances deployed at the  
station. The watch strengths given in the aforementioned accom-  
modation schedule assume the following deployment scenarios\:  
• Bay station – pump ladder and fire rescue unit – watch strength 15  
• Bay station – pump ladder, pump and fire rescue unit – watch  
strength 21  
• Bay station – pump ladder, pump, fire rescue unit and an aerial  
ladder platform – watch strength 23.  
# 1.9 Working practices  
For the relationship of spaces in and around a fire station to suc-  
ceed, they must address the working practices of the firefighters.  
The practices can be grouped into seven routines which can be  
divided into wet-dirty and clean-dry \(Table II\).  
The mobilisation procedure demands that the firefighters move  
at speed through the building to the appliance bays. It is essential  
that circulation routes are generously sized to permit this move-  
ment to be undertaken safely. In particular, junctions must be eased  
so that they do not become collision points. Main circulation paths  
should have a minimum width of 1500 mm and be well illuminated.  
*Routine a – mobilisation*  
The mobilisation of a crew originates from a central mobilising  
control centre. The system is fully computerised so that when a 999  
call reveals an identifiable address the computer flags up the risk  
and recommends to the control officer the location of the resources  
that shall be mobilised to meet the predetermined attendance  
\(PDA\) requirements. If there are no overriding circumstances the  
mobilisation signal is sent.  
A central control computer is aware of the operational status  
of every front line appliance. Each appliance is equipped with a

**19.8** *Pole house layout*  
mobile data pack, which informs the control centre of its opera-  
tional status indicated in Table III.  
The command to mobilise is received by equipment located  
either in the station office or in a watch room and simultaneously  
the mobilisation bells sound throughout the station. The firefight-  
ers proceed to the appliance bay as quickly as possible while the  
duty firefighter attends the call out equipment. They then operates  
the appropriate coloured dispatch lights which tell the assembled  
crew which appliances are to attend the incident. The crews not  
dispatched assume their normal duties about the station.  
On return from an incident, the appliance proceeds to the external  
covered wash-down area where equipment in need of cleaning, repair  
or replacement is attended to. The appliance is then moved into its  
ready position in the appliance bay. The firefighters then attend to  
their own needs and should be able to gain access to their lockers and  
shower facilities without passing through clean/dry accommodation.  
# Table III Status hierarchy  
STATUS 1 Readiness  
STATUS 2 Proceeding to incident  
STATUS 3 Attending at incident  
STATUS 4 Mobile from incident  
STATUS 1 Return to station/readiness  
STATUS 0 Crew/appliance is incapable of further operational duty \(injury etc.\)  
*Routine b – training and drill*  
On station training is a combination of external physical activity  
and lectures and private study. Training is carried out in duty time  
and can be interrupted by a call out. The location of these spaces  
therefore must not hinder a crew’s ability to achieve normal call  
out requirements. Training is carried out by every watch and entails  
the practice of those skills already acquired and also to check that  
operational equipment is in full working order.  
*Routine c – cleaning and maintenance of operational*  
*equipment*  
Station personnel are responsible for the working performance of  
the many items of operational equipment in their care. They must  
ensure that such items receive the required standard of cleaning  
and periodic maintenance. This work is carried out in the BA room,  
operational equipment cleaning room and the operational equip-  
ment store \(work bench area\). All these rooms require easy access  
from the appliance bays.  
*Routine d – administration*  
Administrative duties for a fire and rescue service will include  
logging incident reports and managing operational policy notes,  
records, training and personnel issues. Each watch will have a staff  
member attached to administrative duties. These duties are carried **Emergency services 19-7**  
out within the station office. Confidential matters will be dealt with  
by the station manager or watch manager within their private rooms.  
*Routine e – public interface*  
A community fire station needs to be designed to create an environ-  
ment for firefighters to engage effectively with the local community  
and to provide facilities able to be used by the community and  
which are accessible and welcoming. Members of the public visit  
fire stations for many different reasons. Visitors and events include\:  
• Open days  
• Organised school visits  
• Local commerce  
• Local politicians  
• Local community groups  
• Charity organisers  
• Fire safety – education  
• Fire safety – legislative  
• Sports organisations.  
Visiting members of the public are met at reception and escorted  
to their appointment. Visitors’ names are entered into the station’s  
day book. The public should not be allowed unaccompanied access  
around the station. Rooms to which the public will require access  
from the reception area are normally limited to the community  
engagement facilities.  
*Routine f – stand easy/recreation*  
The inclusion of a fully equipped gymnasium at fire stations provides  
the firefighter with the means to achieve and maintain the high level  
of fitness that their job demands. Television viewing is provided in  
the lecture room. Rest areas can be used during ‘stand easy’ periods.  
*Routine g – arrival for duty*  
On arrival for duty, firefighters go to the locker rooms and change  
into their basic operational uniform. At the same time, there will  
be firefighters preparing to come off duty using the locker rooms  
and showers. Firefighters will then proceed to the fire gear room  
to collect their individual fire gear; helmet, boots, uniform and so  
forth, and proceed to the appliance bay. Their fire gear is placed  
at the side of or on to the appliance. At watch changeover there is  
a roll call in the appliance bays where firefighters receive briefing  
and deployment instructions from the watch manager. Following  
the roll call, all equipment is examined, checked and restored.  
Firefighters then go to the dining area for a short break before tak-  
ing up their normal working routines or those allocated at roll call.  
# 1.10 Special training facilities  
Specialist training facilities may be attached to the fire station or  
have their own site. A typical local training centre for BA and real  
fire training may comprise the accommodation shown in Table IV.  
If the local training centre shares its site with an operational fire  
station some of the aforementioned accommodation may be omitted  
and the station’s facilities be shared with the local training centre.

# 2 AMBULANCE STATIONS  
# 2.1 Introduction  
Ambulance stations are either control stations or their satellites.  
The control stations contain larger store areas and a divisional  
**19.9** *Training tower* **19-8 Emergency services**  
office, and may have dining, recreation and activity areas. On-site  
sleeping accommodation is no longer required. Satellite stations  
have from two to six ambulances and deal only with accident and  
emergency calls. They do not require dining or recreation facilities,  
as off-duty time is spent off the premises, but a rest room will be  
needed for waiting and relaxing between calls.  
Because drugs may be stored on the premises all doors need to  
be lock controlled.  
Like the police, more and more control equipment such as  
faxes, trackers and radios are in the ambulance, permitting greater  
use of these facilities with no need to return to base. However, to  
provide adequate hospital cover, ambulances are stationed there for  
half-hour periods.  
# 2.2 Function  
Apart from accidents and emergencies, the larger stations also  
cover\:  
• Patient transfer  
• Hospital to hospital  
• Home to hospital for consultancy  
• Taxi service.  
# 2.3 Organisation  
Regions are split into about four divisions with a central control.  
Each division normally consists of about six larger stations and 12  
satellites, varying according to population density. All accident and  
emergency calls are received at central control.  
# 2.4 Provision for vehicles  
In small stations with less than seven ambulances, vehicles will  
be reversed onto their parking bays. The station will have an easy-  
to-open individual exit door to each bay \(Figure 19.10\). Larger  
stations use echelon parking with in-and-out access. There must  
be sufficient space behind the parked ambulance to permit easy  
removal of equipment.  
Large stations require a fuel loading bay, but not the smaller  
stations. The current trend is towards using petrol rather than die-  
sel, for smoother running and fewer fumes. A vehicle wash-down  
is required for each station.  
# 2.5 Vehicle workshops  
Vehicle maintenance is carried out in separate workshop buildings  
\(Figure 19.11\), covering at least six stations. It does not need to be  
on the same site as an ambulance station.  
**19.10** *Layout of an ambulance station with six vehicles*  
**19.11** *Layout of a workshop for servicing ambulance vehicles* A workshop normally caters for up to six vehicles at a time,  
so front access only is required. Larger workshops are designed  
for echelon parking with a through-access system. All workshops  
will be capable of carrying out day-to-day maintenance and repairs,  
including the equivalent of MOT testing, standard servicing and  
body repairs. They are not expected to replace engines or crank-  
shafts or do heavy repairs. Finishes must be robust and durable and  
floor surfaces non-slip.  
# 2.6 Duty rooms  
Duty rooms should be close to the garage, have adequate wall  
space for maps and natural lighting and ventilation. Staff in the rest  
room must be able to see what is happening in the duty room, so it  
should be adjacent with a glazed screen between.  
# 2.7 Lockers and changing facilities  
Lockers and changing facilities are linked to showers and toilets.  
In the smaller stations, unisex toilets and showers are acceptable.  
Elsewhere they should be designed to facilitate adjustment when  
the male/female ratio changes.  
# 2.8 Toilets for disabled users  
A toilet for wheelchair users and other disabled people is needed  
although the ambulance operatives themselves need to be fully  
able-bodied.  
# 2.9 Stores  
The main store needs to be a secure facility close to the garage. It  
will accommodate the following in a single area or in separate stores\:  
• Linen such as blankets, sheets, pillowcases and towels  
• Medical supplies such as first-aid dressings, bandages and splints  
• Paramedic equipment such as defibrillators and resuscitators  
• Spare items to replace equipment normally stored in the ambu-  
lance  
• Trolleys, stretchers, etc. belonging to de-kitted vehicles  
• Expendable items and documents, log books and files.  
A separate store within the main store is required for drugs. This  
is separately lockable and alarmed to the duty room.  
Blankets should be kept well ventilated and heated.  
Dirty blankets, linen and contaminated clothes are temporarily  
kept in containers in a disposal store until they can be sent to a laun-  
dry. This disposal store should be near the ambulance parking, but  
away from clean stores and other clean areas. The same place can  
also be used for storing general refuse awaiting removal. Medical  
materials including used needles must be in separate containers for  
special disposal.  
The gas store holds entonox and oxygen in small cylinders for  
use by paramedics. This store must be warm and well ventilated  
with easy access to the ambulances.  
# 2.10 Laundries  
Some regions still require a small blanket laundry in the larger  
stations. However, due to health and safety legislation, with strin-  
gent regulations relating to temperature controls, cleanliness and  
hygiene, there is a strong move towards using contract cleaning  
companies instead.  
# 3 POLICE STATIONS  
# 3.1 Introduction  
The police aim to foster public goodwill; their buildings should  
be as pleasing and friendly to the visitor as possible while being  
compatible with essential security requirements.  
The Home Office has produced most detailed and comprehen-  
sive guides covering legislative requirements, cost and design.  
# Emergency services 19-9  
New stations should be based on the Home Office *Police Buildings*  
*Design Guide* \(2010\), modified to suit the individual local require-  
ments.  
# 3.2 Organisation  
Over the last few years, there has been radical change in organisa-  
tion. Some forces still maintain divisions and subdivisions; others  
have gone over to regions and areas. Some police forces collab-  
orate with others to provide support services for their joint use.  
Regional crime squads come under this heading.  
Because so much of the work has become extremely technical  
and specialised, many of the specialities are accommodated away  
from the custody and public departments.  
The different levels of the organisation require different build-  
ing types\:  
• Headquarters buildings with control extending over a force area  
• Divisional HQs  
• Sub-Divisional HQs, which may be located separately or may  
be combined.  
Headquarters buildings and police stations are all based on the  
same principles, and only vary according to need. A facility like  
a custody suite or communications centre is located in the most  
suitable place regardless of the rank of the building.  
# 3.3 Siting  
Stations should be near public transport, readily available both to  
the local inhabitants and easily found by strangers. They no longer  
need to be near magistrates’ courts. However, when they are, they  
should be totally separate with no shared facilities.  
In busy shopping centres and high streets, police posts with  
direct communications to their headquarters are proving popular  
with both police and public, who provide information there that  
might never be otherwise obtained. The authorities are even con-  
sidering having police posts in supermarkets.  
# 3.4 Design of the station  
The zoning diagram \(Figure 19.12\) is a guide to circulation.  
*The public area* must be designed with an awareness of the dan-  
gers posed by explosives and people with weapons. It should still  
try to maintain a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere. It must be  
easily accessible from the police area. Access and toilet accommo-  
dation for disabled people is essential.  
The reception counter should be located to permit officer  
on-duty supervision of the building entrance. A security screen  
between counter area and waiting is desirable in some circum-  
stances, so that only a limited number can enter at a time. This  
provides both privacy and security. Where there is no screen a pri-  
vacy booth in or on the counter is desirable.  
Waiting areas are provided with seating and notice boards for  
posters on road safety and crime prevention, etc.  
*The public interview area* is entered off the waiting area.  
Interview rooms should be large enough to take several people at a  
time and are fitted with taping equipment.  
*The victim examination suite* should be adjacent to the pub-  
lic entrance and is for interviewing and medical examination of  
assault, child molestation or rape victims. It must be pleasantly  
designed in order to reduce stress \(Figure 19.13\).  
*Found property*  
This is an area accessible only to the police for storing unclaimed  
stolen property and items handed in by the public or found by the  
police. No live animals are kept there, although some stations do  
have special facilities for animals.  
People seeking lost property enquire for it at the reception coun-  
ter, so this should have easy access to the found property store. Its  
size will depend on local requirements. Some forces use warehouses **19-10 Emergency services**  
**19.12** *Relationship and zoning diagram for a large police station*  
**19.13** *Plan of a victim examination suite*  
due to the very large quantities that are collected. Where no large  
store or warehouse is available, bulky items such as bicycles are  
usually stored in out-buildings.  
*Assembly room, lockers, changing and drying rooms*  
They should be located close to the police entrance. Showers and  
toilets should be adjacent to the lockers and to the drying areas  
which should be operational in summer as well as winter.  
*Report writing room*  
These should be adjacent to the assembly room. Booths and acous-  
tic treatment are advisable.  
*Communications and control* are central to the police  
function. Workload is extremely heavy and the working envi-  
ronment should be designed to mitigate stress \(Figure 19.14\).  
The control room deals with force or area-wide facilities includ-  
ing very high frequency radio, and has direct access to police  
resource information and criminal records. Communications  
rooms are principally used for message transfer and receipt of  
information.  
The location and design of the central control room should be  
such as to frustrate any deliberate attempt to dislocate its vitally  
important functions by physical or electronic attack. Its vehicular  
access must ensure an uninterrupted road in an emergency; but no  
parking should be allowed within 15 m of its perimeter.  
*Major incident room*  
A force will on occasions need to work on serious crimes requir-  
ing extensive investigation, civil emergencies or major incidents.  
Accommodation with easy communication connections will be  
required for temporary use by criminal investigation department  
\(CID\), traffic or uniformed branches; when not so required, it **Emergency services 19-11**  
**19.14** *Relationship diagram of a control room suite*  
will be designated for an alternative function such as a gymna-  
sium.  
*Criminal justice office*  
This is for documentation of cases to be brought before the courts.  
*Criminal Investigation Department \(CID\)*  
In some cases, CID would have their own unit separate from the  
police station.  
*Operational group* provides office accommodation for\:  
• Beat patrols  
• Uniformed section  
• Operational control  
• General administration.  
*Administration* covers general administration as opposed to  
operational dependent administration and activities.  
*Traffic* includes accommodation for motor patrols, traffic war-  
dens, garages and workshops.  
Garages and workshops may be on the same site as the station,  
or be a separate unit with attached accommodation for motor patrols  
depending on the size of the area and the number of vehicles. It is  
preferable not to have this unit in a busy city centre where it would  
add to congestion and hinder police cars quickly reaching the scene  
of an incident. If the police area includes motorways, the unit should  
be sited near an access point, or even within a motorway service area.  
The police car is becoming more ‘high tech’, with built-in com-  
puters in addition to two-way radios. It is becoming an office in its  
own right, so that there is less need for the occupants to report in  
person to a police station.  
*Prisoners’ vehicle dock*  
This must be provided away from the main police vehicle yard,  
totally secure and adjacent to the prisoners’ entrance to the building  
\(Figure 19.15\). Figure 19.16 gives data for the prisoner transport  
vehicle.  
*Identification parade facility*  
This has to be carefully sited outside the custody area but linked to  
it by a secure access route. Witnesses should be rigidly segregated  
from each other, and from all members of the parade before, during  
and after the parade; there must be no possibility of physical con-  
tact at any time, or visual contact except during the parade itself  
\(Figure 19.17\). Toilet facilities should be available for witnesses  
and volunteers.  
*Messing and recreation*  
Catering is usually provided by self-help appliances such as frozen  
packaged food with grills or microwave ovens and hot/cold drink  
dispensers. In large stations, there may be a canteen, but 24-hour  
operation is easier to control through packaged meals.  
**19.15** *Plan of a prisoner transport vehicle dock* **19-12 Emergency services**  
**19.16** *A vehicle for transporting prisoners*  
**19.17** *Plan of an identity parade suite*  
*Toilets*  
Lavatory accommodation is related to size of station and disposi-  
tion of rooms. Separate provision is made for\:  
• Male sergeants, constables and civilian staff  
• Female sergeants, constables and civilian staff  
• Senior officers  
• Chief constables and assistant chief constables have en-suite  
facilities  
• Visitors, usually located at the public entrance  
• Disabled people, also close to the public entrance  
• Cell accommodation.  
*Blast proofing* is now mandatory for all police stations; no car  
parking should be positioned within 15 m of the buildings, 10 m for  
operational vehicles.  
*Mechanical ventilation and cooling* is provided for information  
and communications accommodation without natural ventilation.  
*Emergency electrical supply* is essential throughout, not only  
for power failure but also in the event of fire. In large stations,  
it will be necessary to ensure continuity of supply to the custody  
suite, radios, computers and communication service equipment,  
and must have ‘direct on-line automatic start’.  
An uninterrupted power supply \(UPS\) will be required for com-  
puter areas.  
# 3.5 Custody suite  
This includes detention rooms, charge desk\(s\) and ancillary accom-  
modation \(Figures 19.18 and 19.19\). The police have to be alert  
to the possibility of someone in custody attempting suicide. Care  
needs to be taken to avoid this eventuality particularly in the design  
of the cells \(see Section 3.6\).  
The custody area should be securely separated from other parts  
of the building. It should be located on a single level to avoid mov-  
ing prisoners up and down stairs which should be avoided at all  
costs. Where minor changes in level are unavoidable internally or  
externally, ramps should be used.  
Corridors and cells for female prisoners should be segregated  
from those for male prisoners. Each should have separate access  
to the exercise yard. Detention rooms for juveniles should also be  
separate from adult areas.  
*Catering*  
Prisoners and police within the custody area need to be fed.  
However, a kitchenette within the custody area is undesirable as  
it would divert the custody officer from essential tasks and also  
be a fire risk. The self-catering facility in the amenity area is also  
unacceptable, as it would take officers away from the custody area.  
There is little alternative, therefore, to a staffed kitchen immedi-  
ately outside the custody area preparing food in compliance with  
food hygiene regulations and providing the meals close to the  
users. If there is a canteen which is fully staffed for 24 hours, this  
may be used.  
*Detention suite*  
This is a facility where the WC is outside the cell \(Figure 19.20\),  
where additional washing facilities can be securely provided.  
*WCs*  
The compartment should have a stable-type hinged door, not a  
sliding one, with an observation aperture. The cistern should be  
outside the compartment with secured access and a protected  
flushing pipe. The flushing device should be outside the reach of a  
prisoner attempting suicide by drowning, and should not be a chain  
or project from the wall. There should be no projecting toilet roll  
holder, exposed overflow pipe, bracket, service pipe or stopcock.  
Fittings should not be able to be broken or extracted to make tools  
or weapons. **Emergency services 19-13**  
**19.18** *Relationship and zoning diagram for a custody suite*  
*Washing facilities*  
Basins should not be inside cells. They should be supported on  
metal stands, not cantilever brackets, and provided with captive  
plugs without chains. Towel holders are not used as the towels  
could be used to facilitate suicide, and the holder would provide  
points to which a ligature could be attached. Facilities for female  
prisoners must be properly screened. For use inside cells, prisoners  
are provided with disinfectant/cologne-impregnated wash pads as  
on aircraft.  
*Cell corridor*  
The entrance should be fitted with an iron gate. The corridor should  
have alarm pushes for the custody officer’s use if attacked. There  
should be no exposed pipes, valves, electric cables or conduit, and  
any thermometer should be outside the reach of a passing prisoner.  
*Exercise yard*  
The walls should be high enough to prevent a prisoner escaping,  
at least 3.6 m. There should be no ledges or other features which  
enable a prisoner to climb. However, where for any reason the  
height and detailing of the walls are deemed insufficient to pre-  
vent escape, a top cover may be used. There should be no doors  
or windows opening into the yard which might enable a prisoner  
to reach the top cover, nor any unlockable inspection chamber  
covers or gully gratings which could be lifted. Rainwater and soil  
pipes should be flaunched up in cement mortar to obviate hand-  
holds.  
# 3.6 Cell design  
The Police Design Guides are explicit in their requirements  
reflected in a typical design, as shown in Figure 19.21. **19-14 Emergency services**  
**19.19** *Plan of a custody suite \(for security reasons this is based on the design principles, but is not an actual example\)*  
**19.20** *Plan of a detention suite* **19.21** *Plan of a custody cell* *Windows*  
Cell windows which are unguarded and with openable panes  
should not overlook roads or other public areas. Windows over-  
looking exercise yards should be both guarded and screened to  
prevent observation. Windows to ancillary accommodation within  
the cell suite such as blanket store, property store, cell corridor,  
gaoler’s room, toilets, and so forth should all be guarded. The  
glazing should be of toughened opaque glass fitted flush to the  
wall with no protrusions to facilitate injury or suicide, or ledges  
facilitating escape and attacks on officers. The thickness of the  
glass increases with larger panes. Glass should not be replaced for  
ventilation purposes with, for example, perforated zinc.  
*Ceilings*  
Most suspended ceilings can be easily broken, giving access to  
other parts of the building and possibly providing improvised tools  
or weapons.  
*Doors*  
All doors should be prisoner-proof and flush.  
*Cell furniture*  
These should not be of timber or able to be prised loose to make a  
tool or a weapon.  
*Ventilation*  
Casings to trunking should be secure against breakage and use by pris-  
oners to facilitate suicide. Grilles under cell benches should be securely  
fixed using non-withdrawable screws. High-level air vents with perfo-  
rations should not be larger than 4.7 mm diameter, of a material that  
will break under load and fitted flush with the wall surface.  
# Emergency services 19-15  
*Lighting*  
Cell light fittings should be fitted flush with the ceiling with unwith-  
drawable screws. They should have twin lamp holders and plastic  
lenses. Electrical supplies should not be exposed and the switches  
should be outside the cell with cover plates that cannot be removed  
to gain access to live parts.  
*Heating*  
Electric radiant heaters with exposed wiring should not be used to  
heat cells, neither should exposed hot water radiators. There should  
be no protrusions of any kind to which a ligature could be attached.  
*Cell call system*  
This should comprise a press button within the cell fitted flush  
with the wall operating a bell and indicator light externally. It  
should be on a separate circuit from the lighting, and the indicator  
light board should be under constant observation by the officer-  
in-charge.  
*Maintenance*  
Damaged cells should be withdrawn from use.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Health  
The World Health Organization defines health as ‘a state of com-  
plete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the  
absence of disease or infirmity’ \(*Constitution of the World Health*  
*Organization – Basic Documents*, 45th edition, Supplement,  
October 2006\).  
Traditionally, healthcare provision has focused primarily on the  
latter half of this definition\: the technical challenge of defeating a  
medical condition, at the expense of the less easily definable and  
measurable actions required to support the first part. The result is a  
reactive system that treats healthcare as a series of isolated episodes,  
rather than a proactive ongoing process focused on anticipating and,  
where possible, preventing the need for medical treatment.  
Too often, the design of healthcare buildings has reflected this  
imbalance, creating institutional and de-humanising environments.  
However, research clearly demonstrates the benefits of a more  
holistic approach to healthcare design, and architects have devel-  
oped new approaches that better support the needs of all hospital  
users. The ability to deliver these benefits is challenged, however,  
by current economic conditions, and by procurement routes that  
focus on narrow definitions of value.  
# 1.2 Challenges  
Hospitals are among the most complex of building types, requiring  
the designer to find a solution that resolves numerous potentially  
conflicting needs. Hospitals are highly advanced facilities,  
incorporating complex circulation networks, extensive environ-  
mental systems and advanced technologies. But they are also civic  
buildings that must prioritise the creation of attractive and coherent  
spaces that are inherently legible, safe and secure and spatially effi-  
cient.  
Several standardised design templates for hospitals have been  
developed in the past, such as the Nucleus Hospitals built in  
large numbers in the UK from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s.  
However, these large-scale standardised systems could not adapt  
to deliver the specifics of local healthcare need, or to overcome  
site constraints, resulting in hospitals that were inherently compro-  
mised and, in some respects, inflexible. Subsequent standardisation  
initiatives have focused on smaller elements such as repeatable  
rooms and components.  
In reality, every hospital is different. In the UK, new hospital  
developments are mostly sited on an existing hospital campus,  
and therefore must deliver the specified accommodation, while  
resolving complex challenges imposed by the existing estate, and  
devising a construction strategy that enables clinical services to  
continue with minimal disruption during construction.  
The key to successfully negotiating these complexities is to  
develop an iterative design process that alternates engagement with  
input from stakeholders with the progression of the design propos-  
als. This approach will need to be bespoke to each project. At the  
early stages, several strands might be developed in parallel, such  
as consultation to capture and sign off the client’s functional needs  
and aspirations, high-level testing of building organisation strate-  
gies, site analysis and design studies for the key repeating building  
blocks \(such as a standard single bedroom or outpatients consult-  
ing room\) that will combine to form a high proportion of the total  
building. As the design moves forward through multiple iterations,  
it will become progressively more detailed and coordinated, and  
will need to negotiate a series of client approval processes. During  
these stages, the architect performs a crucial role in defending the  
client’s aspirations against dilution or compromise.  
# 1.3 Hospital design skills  
The design of hospitals draws upon both general design skills and  
highly specialised sector-specific knowledge. Maintaining a careful  
balance between achieving quantitative objectives and creating an  
environment that enriches the lives of all those who use the build-  
ing is fundamental\: hospitals are places of care, and care cannot be  
defined in purely technical terms.  
To achieve this balance, it is essential that the architect\:  
• Understands how a medical facility will be used and occupied  
from the perspective of patients, clinical staff, support staff and  
the families and carers of patients  
• Knows what guidance can be drawn upon to ensure that a new  
facility will achieve current best practice, and how to apply that  
guidance to the unique needs of a specific project  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-23 **20-1** **20-2 Hospitals**  
• Keeps abreast of changes in health needs and healthcare and the  
latest research  
• Plans for current needs, while ensuring that future change is  
facilitated  
• Works collaboratively with the other design disciplines to  
resolve the complex technical and coordination issues associated  
with highly serviced healthcare environments  
• Prioritises creating the best possible environment for all building  
users by using the same tools as for any other building type\: light,  
colour, spatial variety, simplicity and a relationship with nature.  
# 2 CONTEXT  
# 2.1 The National Health Service \(NHS\)  
The NHS is the name used to refer to the autonomous public health-  
care systems in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland  
public health services are provided by Health and Social Care  
Northern Ireland \(HSC\). These four health systems are responsible  
for the provision of the vast majority of healthcare services in the UK.  
In the UK, the majority of healthcare services are provided by the  
NHS. Though it is synonymous with healthcare in the UK, it is just  
the largest component in a complex network of care providers that  
also includes local government provided social care, care provided  
by voluntary and charitable organisations, and private healthcare.  
Alternate providers may provide their services ‘privately’ or may  
provide services which are procured by the NHS to deliver ‘public’  
services. In many cases the same organisation will do both.  
The NHS was founded in 1948, based on three key principles\:  
• That it meets the needs of everyone  
• That it be free at the point of delivery  
• That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.  
Publicly funded healthcare provision in England is controlled  
at governmental level by the Department of Health, which takes  
overall responsibility for the organisations that comprise the NHS.  
Recent reforms have focused on introducing market-based reforms  
to the service. These changes have been driven both by adherence  
at governmental level to free market economic principles, and by  
the need for the NHS to evolve to meet the challenges of changing  
health needs and demographics.  
In *The NHS Constitution* \(2011\), the founding principles of the  
NHS were expanded\:  
• Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individ-  
ual’s ability to pay  
• The NHS aspires to the highest standards of excellence and pro-  
fessionalism  
• The NHS aspires to put patients at the heart of everything it does  
• The NHS works across organisational boundaries and in part-  
nership with other organisations in the interest of patients, local  
communities and the wider population  
• The NHS is committed to providing best value for taxpayers’  
money and the most effective, fair and sustainable use of finite  
resources  
• The NHS is accountable to the public, communities and patients  
that it serves.  
These reflect a changing political context in which facilitating  
consumer choice and creating competition between healthcare  
providers is seen as crucial to meeting increasing demands upon  
healthcare providers, and to driving efficiency. These changes are  
reflected in the relegation of the commitment for the service to be  
free at the point of delivery to a note within Principle 2, which  
states that ‘NHS services are free of charge, except in limited cir-  
cumstances sanctioned by Parliament’. Instances where charges  
currently apply include drug prescriptions, and most eye care and  
dental services, where patients are required to pay a contribution  
towards the cost of their care, calculated based \(to some extent\) on  
their ability to pay.  
# 2.2 Whole health economy  
The structure of healthcare provision in the UK is a complex sys-  
tem referred to as the whole health economy. Care in a hospital  
setting may occur at several points in this process. Healthcare pro-  
vision is structured as follows\:  
• *Primary care*\: The first point of contact a patient has when they  
require a healthcare service. Primary care includes General  
Practitioners \(GPs\), dental practices and optometrists.  
• *Secondary care*\: Healthcare provided by clinicians who do not  
usually have first contact with patients, including specialists.  
Patients will generally either receive secondary care following  
a referral by a GP, or following attendance at an Emergency  
Department. Non-emergency secondary care could take the form  
of a consultation with a specialist, a planned surgical procedure  
or a diagnostic investigation. Secondary healthcare is most often  
provided in a hospital setting, but not always.  
• *Tertiary care*\: Highly specialised healthcare, for instance care that  
requires input from consultants with very specific expertise, or  
access to advanced diagnostic modalities or surgical facilities, of a  
level that is not available at most hospitals. Tertiary care will gener-  
ally be received following a referral from primary or secondary care.  
Due to its specialist nature, Tertiary care will normally be available  
on a regional basis, rather than local to a particular population.  
• *Quaternary care*\: The most specialised healthcare, such as  
advanced diagnostic and surgical procedures, or the application  
of experimental approaches to the treatment of medical con-  
ditions. Such services are only provided in a small number of  
locations, either regionally or nationally.  
• *Mental health care*\: Including community, day and inpatient ser-  
vices for people requiring mental health care.  
• *Community health services*\: Community Healthcare NHS Trusts  
provide a wide range of non-acute services that include com-  
munity nursing, therapies, non-acute outpatient and inpatient  
services, support for people with disabilities and chronic health  
conditions, and walk in and urgent care centres.  
• *Social care*\: The definition of social care includes a wide range  
of services to support people who are at risk, or who have needs  
caused by illness, disability, old age or poverty. Social care  
services such as home/domiciliary care and residential nursing  
home care are closely related to and impact upon healthcare ser-  
vices. In England and Wales, social care is currently in most  
instances the responsibility of local authorities, though there are  
moves towards greater integration with the NHS. In Northern  
Ireland and Scotland, health and social care are delivered by  
integrated service providers.  
• Care funded by the NHS may also be provided by private and  
third sector organisations.  
The vast majority of hospital buildings will be for the provision  
of secondary care. Most of the facilities in these buildings will be  
developed from tried-and-tested standard approaches, and design  
guidance will therefore be applicable in most instances, although  
changing methods of delivery may result in differing require-  
ments. Health buildings providing tertiary and quaternary care may  
require more innovative and bespoke approaches to their design to  
reflect the more specialist nature of the care they provide, and more  
project-specific research regarding the architectural implications of  
new or experimental forms of care.  
# 2.3 Specialist hospital and healthcare facilities  
These cater specifically for a type of illness, chronic or complex  
condition in an appropriate environment. Hospitals include\:  
• *Cancer/oncology hospitals*\: These combine the highest quality  
of diagnosis, treatment and care, include research and education  
and provide specialist equipment with latest technologies. Refer  
to *HBN 02–01 Cancer treatment facilities*.  
• *Children’s hospitals*\: By grouping children together, a safer  
environment can be created. Children must be treated by clini-  
cians specialised in their care. Further specific requirements are  
the provision of accommodation for parents within the patient  
room, a variety and choice of play areas, and stimulation through  
interior and graphics besides specially designed fittings and fur-  
niture for children of different ages \(Figure 20.1\). Refer to *HBN*  
*23 – Hospital accommodation for children and young people*.  
• *Maternity*\: The facility needs to cater for women at different  
stages of their pregnancy. Maternity buildings provide different  
types of accommodation accompanying the birthing process as  
well as critical care services. Specific requirements include a  
variety and choice of delivery rooms, and an emphasis on pri-  
vacy, dignity and a less clinical and more domestic environment.  
Refer to *HBN 09–02 Maternity Care Facilities*.  
• *Heart \(cardiac care\) hospitals*.  
Healthcare facilities include\:  
• *Accommodation for rehabilitation*\: Due to the nature of injuries  
being treated and facilities being provided \(e.g. hydrotherapy  
pool\), the accommodation is mainly provided in single storey  
# Hospitals 20-3  
buildings to provide level access for the patients, and the build-  
ing usually spreads over a larger footprint.  
• *Renal \(kidney\) units*\: Refer to HBN 07–02 Main Renal Unit or  
HBN 07–01 Satellite dialysis unit.  
• *Elderly/nursing homes*\: Compared to a hospital environment, nurs-  
ing homes and facilities for the elderly provide more communal  
spaces for interaction, consist of mainly single room accommodation  
and emphasise the separation between genders to enhance dignity.  
• *Dementia centres*\: Refer to HBN 08–02 Dementia-friendly  
Health and Social Care Environments.  
• *Primary and Community Care Services*\: Refer to HBN 11–01.  
# 2.4 The Health and Social Care Act 2012  
The current structure for how healthcare services in England are  
commissioned was created through the implementation of the  
Health and Social Care Act 2012. In the previous structure, most  
hospital-based healthcare was controlled by geographically defined  
Primary Care Trusts \(PCTs\), working within a strategic context  
established by Strategic Health Authorities \(SHAs\). This system  
has been replaced by a structure in which Clinical Commissioning  
Groups \(CCGs\) control the commissioning of hospital-based and  
community healthcare services.  
CCGs are currently responsible for commissioning services  
that comprise approximately two-thirds of the total NHS England  
budget. The key difference between CCGs and the PCTs they  
replaced is that CCGs are membership bodies, comprising local GP  
practices, led by an elected governing body primarily comprising  
GPs, together with other clinicians and lay members.  
**20.1** *Sheffield Children’s Hospital by Avanti Architects. A light-filled and playful main entrance atrium entices and engages children* **20-4 Hospitals**  
These changes to the structure of the NHS were implemented  
with the aim of promoting localised control of commissioning, in  
order to increase patient choice, drive cost efficiencies through the  
elimination of a layer of administration, and open up opportuni-  
ties for private and voluntary sector organisations to compete with  
NHS Trusts to deliver publicly funded healthcare services.  
Since 2017, mergers between CCGs have been permitted, and  
a process of consolidation into bodies covering larger portions of  
cities and regions is now ongoing.  
# 2.5 Sustainability and transformation partnerships and  
# integrated care systems  
In recent years, portions of the NHS have increasingly struggled  
to deal with the challenges of increasing demand and changing  
demographics. This is compounded by the fragmented nature of  
healthcare provision in England that recent NHS reorganisations  
have contributed to. A need for joined up local strategies, devel-  
oped with input from stakeholders from across the Whole Health  
Economy, has been identified as the means to tackle these chal-  
lenges, and in so doing help to address the increasing financial  
pressures affecting many parts of the NHS.  
This identified need led to the implementation of Sustainability  
and Transformation Plans \(STPs\) for all parts of England during  
2016\. These created ‘place-based plans’ for the future of health  
and care services in each of the 44 areas. The stakeholders for each  
plan area are the local NHS Trusts, local authorities and CCGs. The  
collaborative process for the creation of these plans is intended to  
ensure that services are delivered by the most appropriate part of  
the local health and care system, and that decisions are not skewed  
by the priorities of individual organisations.  
The definition of the STP acronym has more recently been  
changed to Sustainability and Transformation Partnership, and a  
process has begun in which all STPs will become Integrated Care  
Systems \(ICSs\). ICSs comprise NHS organisations, local authori-  
ties and other bodies, which take collective responsibility for the  
effective management of care provision, and for the health of the  
population they serve.  
Together, these changes represent a move from the focus on gen-  
erating competition between healthcare providers that was central  
to the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, towards the prioritisation  
of collaboration between public sector bodies with responsibilities  
relating to health and care.  
# 2.6 Key differences in how health services function  
# across the UK  
The key differences between the NHS organisations providing  
care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland relate to  
the relationship between healthcare and social care provision. The  
separation of social care from health care, with the former being  
provided by local authorities and the latter by the NHS, has been  
seen in recent years as significantly contributing to deteriorating  
quality and escalating financial deficits among NHS Trusts in  
England. In Northern Ireland, there is a long-established princi-  
ple that health and social care services are provided by combined  
organisations. Scotland has recently established Integration Joint  
Boards \(local authority social care and NHS community care inte-  
grated boards\) to ensure that the provision of healthcare and social  
care is coordinated. In England, several regions have pioneered  
similar integrated approaches.  
# 2.7 Healthcare funding  
Since the financial crisis of 2008, growth in government expenditure  
on the NHS has fallen behind. While it is still matching inflation, it  
is not matching increases in need caused by demographic change,  
and increases in cost required to fund new treatments.  
Cost per person of healthcare varies to a very substantial degree  
worldwide. While the UK is ranked towards the upper end of the  
scale for healthcare expenditure per capita, it is ranked below many  
similarly developed economies. By many measures, the NHS is  
highly efficient in how it uses the funding it receives. Outcomes  
related to treatment for certain conditions, such as cancers, lag  
behind other similar nations, however, and this has been argued is  
the result of long-term underinvestment.  
In the current funding climate, NHS client bodies are needing  
to optimise the efficiency of spending on capital projects \(such  
as buildings\), making the best possible use of existing assets \(for  
instance through refurbishment of existing buildings\), and not  
committing to large scale redevelopment projects whose benefits  
will only be fully felt in the long term.  
In recognition of the risks associated with longstanding restric-  
tions on capital funding for healthcare infrastructure in 2019, the  
UK government introduced the Health Infrastructure Plan \(HIP\) as  
the means to plan and fund the upgrading of the built estate used  
by the NHS. The aim of the plan is to modernise the estate, support  
the use of new treatments and technologies, eliminate safety risks  
and reduce the drain on resources caused by the increasing cost of  
backlog maintenance. The ambition of the plan is to transform the  
NHS’s infrastructure – whether funding will be made available to  
achieve this goal is not yet clear.  
# 2.8 Demographic change  
Demographic changes are putting ever-increasing pressures on  
healthcare delivery. People are living longer, and improvements in  
treatment are extending the lifespans of patients with chronic medi-  
cal conditions, but at a cost. These changes will increasingly be felt  
in the design of hospitals, particularly in the need to create environ-  
ments that take into account the needs of patients with dementia.  
These demographic changes have played a key role in one of  
the most significant issues to affect the operation of hospitals in  
recent years – ‘bed-blocking’. The ageing population, shortages of  
funding for social care, and the split in responsibility for inpatient  
and social care between NHS and local government organisations,  
have led to problems in discharging patients. This in turn results  
in unnecessary costs being incurred caring for patients who do not  
need to be in hospital, while reducing the throughput of patients  
who require inpatient care.  
The impacts of the ageing population are not uniform, however,  
and a single, generalised design response would not be appropri-  
ate. The design of healthcare facilities should reflect local needs,  
taking into account the age, income and cultural profile of the local  
population.  
The nature of hospital accommodation is also being impacted  
by the rise in the proportion of the population that are overweight,  
with facilities increasingly being designed to enable care for  
severely overweight \(bariatric\) patients.  
# 2.9 Technological advances  
Medical advances have also affected the types of healthcare buildings  
that are being commissioned, generating some important efficiencies  
in the quantity of accommodation required to deliver services. In par-  
ticular, advances in minimally intrusive surgical procedures mean that  
many patients that would previously have required inpatient care dur-  
ing their recovery can now be treated and discharged during one day.  
This is one of a number of changes that may result in reductions  
of inpatient beds on hospital sites in the future. As a high propor-  
tion of low-risk and routine surgery is dealt with on a day basis,  
however, those requiring inpatient care in the future will tend to be  
sicker, with more complex needs, than was the norm in the past.  
The long-term trend towards a reduction in bed numbers across  
the NHS has come under scrutiny during the Covid-19 pandemic,  
however, with concerns raised regarding the ability of hospitals  
with reduced inpatient capacities to respond to surges in the num-  
ber of patients needing inpatient care. In future, strategies will be  
required to enable this flexibility, for example by enabling the rapid  
re-purposing of clinical accommodation to provide additional crit-  
ical care capacity. Other key changes that are affecting the design of hospitals  
include\:  
• *New imaging modalities*\: The increasing number of imaging  
modalities used in healthcare increases the need for appropriately  
designed buildings that meet highly technical specifications.  
Larger magnets in Magnetic Resonance Imaging \(MRI\) equip-  
ment are becoming more common, yielding much higher detail  
and image clarity. New developments in Nuclear Medicine  
are also calling for very particular bespoke designs, such as  
those required for Positron Emission Tomography – Computed  
Tomography \(PET CT\), and Single-Photon Emission Computed  
Tomography \(SPECT\).  
• *Advances in cancer treatment*\: Linear Accelerators \(Linac\) have  
been used for the treatment of cancers for several decades, but  
have been becoming increasingly accurate with less co-lateral  
damage as the processes are refined. Proton Beam Therapy  
Centres are one of the latest forms of cancer treatment, allowing  
pinpoint accuracy of treatment but requiring enormous, highly  
serviced and technically complex facilities.  
• *Genetics and genomics*\: One of the most promising areas of med-  
ical innovation over recent years has been driven by research  
into how health and disease are influenced by human genetics.  
It is anticipated that further developments in this field will open  
up the potential in future for treatments that are tailored to the  
individual, targeting a wide range of conditions that are cur-  
rently difficult to treat. This reflects a general trend towards the  
increased personalisation of treatment.  
• *Smart hospitals*\: innovation in digital technologies and data  
analytics have created the potential for the creation of power-  
ful tools to enable the optimisation of clinical and operational  
processes. The increasingly sophisticated and integrated digital  
infrastructure within hospital estates will be utilised to provide  
instant insights into operational efficiency, and will inform  
data-driven simulations of options for ways in which processes,  
clinical services and infrastructure can be improved. This will in  
turn enable improvements in patient care, user experience and  
operational efficiency.  
• *Virtual consultations*\: one of the key changes that has been  
driven by the Covid-19 pandemic has been the rapid adoption  
of virtual communication tools across all business sectors and  
by the public more broadly. In future, this revolution in how  
people communicate will be reflected in how hospitals operate  
and how they are designed. Consultations will increasingly take  
place remotely, reducing the need for patients to travel to the  
hospital. Outpatient departments will reduce in size, as only  
those patients requiring treatments and diagnostics that must be  
delivered in person will be required to attend clinics. In order for  
this transformation to benefit all users in an equitable manner,  
however, it will be necessary to address issues of access to and  
use of the required technologies, to avoid discriminating against  
people based on their economic circumstances, age or physical  
capabilities.  
# 3 REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS  
# 3.1 Regulatory bodies  
There are many regulatory bodies that control the standard of  
healthcare provision in the UK. Most are primarily concerned with  
the services provided by specific medical specialties, and will rarely  
have a direct impact upon the work carried out by an architect.  
Two regulatory bodies that do have a significant impact upon  
healthcare building requirements in England are the Care Quality  
Commission \(CQC\) and the Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\)\:  
• *The CQC* is the independent regulator of all health and social  
care in England. This regulates all bodies that provide care, not  
# Hospitals 20-5  
just the NHS. The scope of the CQC’s responsibilities include  
local authority provided social care, and health care and resi-  
dential care provided by the independent and charitable sectors.  
The CQC conducts inspections that draw upon data, feedback  
from users and inspections by experts. Reports and rating are  
published following each inspection \(to drive improvement and  
to inform the public and other healthcare providers in making  
informed choices\). Findings from CQC inspections will often  
inform the development of the brief for a healthcare design pro-  
ject.  
• *The HSE* is the enforcing authority with regard to health and  
safety for workers in England, Scotland and Wales and also for  
patient and service users in Scotland and Wales \(in England this  
role is performed by the CQC\). The HSC carries out inspections,  
and investigations in response to incidents or complaints. The  
remit of the HSC includes responsibility for investigating many  
issues that are closely related to the design of healthcare build-  
ings, such as slips and trips, manual handling problems, and  
legionella/infections. Other aspects of its remit, such as stress  
and violence at work, can also have a relationship to the design  
of a healthcare facility.  
# 3.2 Regulations affecting hospital design  
Hospital design is subject to many of the same regulations that must  
be addressed in all types of architecture\: workplace regulations,  
the Building Regulations, Health & Safety legislation, and national  
and local planning regulations/requirements. One area where regu-  
lations differ is with regard to fire, where the Department of Health  
published Health Technical Memoranda \(HTM\) Firecode suite of  
documents take precedence over the Building Regulations \(with  
the exception of areas that are not healthcare-specific, such as  
office buildings built for NHS Trusts\).  
# 3.3 Healthcare design standards  
The Department of Health has issued several series of standards  
documents providing guidance to support the design of healthcare  
facilities\:  
• *Health Building Notes \(HBNs*\) provide the standard guidance for  
planning and design where hospital facilities are to accommo-  
date NHS services.  
• *Health Technical Memoranda \(HTMs\)* provide technical, com-  
ponent and engineering standards and requirements.  
Health services in the UK are devolved to national govern-  
ments. Despite information often having the same sources, there  
are some differences in standards. Current versions of these doc-  
uments can be downloaded from the respective document portals  
on www.gov.uk.  
The recommendations, sample layouts and space standards  
established in the HBN series provide a valuable starting point for  
the development of design proposals, and a means to subsequently  
audit developing designs. They should not be accepted unquestion-  
ingly, however, as there may be design approaches that differ from  
the standard which are more appropriate to the specific require-  
ments of a project. All areas must be ratified against activities and  
client needs.  
On all projects for NHS clients, a list of derogations from HBN  
or HTM standards should be maintained, to ensure that changes  
have been identified, that there are reasons for taking a different  
approach to that described in the document, and that the client body  
has understood and signed off the derogations.  
The future of guidance for building design is becoming  
increasingly uncertain as the centralised and knowledgeable  
organisation which established them, NHS Estates, has been  
disbanded. Many organisations, such as Architects for Health,  
are campaigning to have the quality of guidance maintained and  
updated. **20-6 Hospitals**  
# 4 PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION  
# 4.1 Client types  
There are several different client types who might procure buildings\:  
*NHS Hospital Trusts/NHS Acute Trusts*  
NHS secondary, tertiary, quaternary, mental health, community  
care and ambulance services are provided by organisations called  
NHS Trusts. In the case of secondary, tertiary and quaternary  
care providers, these are referred to as NHS Hospital Trusts or  
NHS Acute Trusts. Some NHS Trusts are devoted to a particular  
specialism, such as paediatric, cardiothoracic or cancer care.  
*NHS Foundation Trusts*  
In England, NHS Foundation Trusts have a degree of auton-  
omy from the Department of Health, greater financial freedom  
than conventional NHS Trusts, and can earn up to 49 per cent of  
their income from providing care to private patients. Subsequent  
changes to the organisation of the NHS have eroded some aspects  
of the differences between Foundation and non-Foundation NHS  
Trusts, with all types of trust now falling under the control of a sin-  
gle organisation, NHS England and NHS Improvement \(NHSEI\).  
*The independent sector*  
In the UK, there are a small number of major private hospi-  
tals, generally located in the London area, providing advanced,  
bespoke care. These hospitals target high-income customers  
from the UK and abroad. They market themselves on providing  
access to the best consultants, and on their high-tech facilities,  
which will include advanced imaging modalities and surgical  
facilities, and potentially their own intensive care units.  
The vast majority of private hospitals in the UK are part of a  
series of chains that dominate the mid-market of private health-  
care provision. They are more widely distributed geographically  
than the leading private hospitals, and are generally much  
smaller than NHS hospitals, focusing on outpatient and day care  
and low-risk surgical procedures.  
Some NHS Trusts operate their own private wings. These are  
often specialist hospitals such as centres of excellence for cancer  
care. These may be separately accessed from the main hospital to  
create a clear distinction from facilities providing NHS services,  
but will in practice often share some clinical and clinical support  
facilities.  
Private hospitals seek to differentiate themselves from the NHS  
through branding and interior design in order to convey an  
impression of exclusivity.  
# 4.2 Procurement routes  
The role of the architect in the design of a hospital can vary depend-  
ing on the procurement route \(the process followed to purchase the  
new facility\) adopted by the client body.  
The most frequently used procurement routes are\:  
• *Traditional procurement*. The client appoints a design team to  
design the project and prepare tender documentation. Contractors  
are then invited to submit tenders for the construction of the  
project on a competitive basis. In traditional procurement, the  
architect and design team remain appointed by the client \(e.g. an  
NHS Trust\) throughout the construction process. The architect  
will also generally perform the role of contract administrator.  
• *Design & build procurement*. The client appoints a design team  
to design the project and prepare an Employer’s Requirement set  
of documents, which are used to appoint a contractor through a  
competitive tender process. The tender documentation is gener-  
ally at a lower level of detail than in a traditional contract, and  
following appointment the contractor will employ their own  
design team to develop the proposals. Post tender, the design  
team initially appointed by the client may no longer be involved  
in the project, or may be appointed by the contractor to develop  
their detailed contractor’s proposals, or may be retained by the  
client to advise them during the detailed design development and  
project delivery stages.  
• Both traditional and design & build procurement can utilise  
either single stage or two stage tender processes. Two stage pro-  
cesses enable the earlier appointment of a contractor\: in the first  
stage, a limited appointment is agreed allowing the contractor to  
begin work, and in the second stage, a fixed price is negotiated  
for the contract.  
• *Private Finance Initiative \(PFI\) procurement*. This procurement  
route utilised private sector funding \(underwritten by the public\)  
in the delivery of public sector projects such as hospitals. It is  
a form of Public Private Partnership \(PPP\). The private sector  
organisation builds, funds and operates the facility. PFI procure-  
ment has been used to procure a large proportion of the major  
hospital projects built in the UK since the late 1990s.  
• Concerns over whether PFI provided value for money over the  
lifespan of the building led to the introduction of an amended  
approach, referred to as PF2. The use of PFI procurement was  
‘retired’ by the government in 2018, and information is currently  
awaited on any replacement process by which private investment  
can be utilised in NHS infrastructure projects. Most of the exist-  
ing PFI contracts are still in operation, however, and where this  
is the case, the contractual terms of these deals can have signifi-  
cant implications on how development takes place.  
• *ProCure22 \(P22\) Procurement* \(previously P21 / P21+\). This  
procurement route, which has been widely used in England in  
recent years, is a form of two stage design and build procurement  
in which a Principle Supply Chain Partner \(the PSCP – effec-  
tively the contractor\) is selected at an early project stage from  
a list of the six private sector partners included on a national  
\(England-wide\) framework. In this route, the architect would be  
appointed by the PSCP, and would be drawn from their list of  
pre-selected consultants. It is planned that the P22 framework  
will be replaced by a new framework operating on similar prin-  
ciples, named ProCure23, during 2022.  
• *NHS Building for Wales Framework*. This is a similar approach  
to P22 used in Wales for the procurement of healthcare build-  
ings. This framework comprises four national \(for larger  
projects\), and five regional \(for smaller projects\) supply chain  
partners \(constructors\).  
• *Performance Related Partnering \(PRP\)*. Here a contractor is  
appointed to deliver multiple projects, but their appointment on  
the subsequent projects will be dependent on achieving required  
levels of performance against pre-established measures. This  
approach has been widely used in Northern Ireland, where it has  
been favoured by Health and Social Care Northern Ireland as a  
means to incentivise high quality project delivery.  
• *Hub*. Used in Scotland for the procurement of publicly funded  
buildings. In this system, Scotland is divided into five geograph-  
ical areas known as ‘territories’. A private sector development  
partner is appointed in each area to work in partnership with  
the public sector to deliver projects on a PPP basis. Within each  
territory, there is a supply chain of constructors and consultants  
\(including architects\) who can tender to carry out work. The  
hub approach differs from other frameworks described earlier in  
that it can be used to procure any public sector project, not just  
healthcare.  
# 4.3 Construction  
Building in an urban environment or on an existing hospital site can  
present a wide range of challenges during the construction period.  
The majority of hospital projects include refurbishment of existing  
buildings and are required to maintain continuity of care through-  
out the construction process. For this, coordination between the client, hospital estates teams,  
architects, service engineers and the contractor is essential along  
with the development of a detailed phasing strategy. This might  
require floors to be vacated or accommodation to be decanted tem-  
porarily or provided off site. Preparation of a logistics plan and  
communication with the client, staff and patients can alert them at  
an early stage to what to expect during the construction. This may  
increase tolerance levels.  
Other logistical challenges include\:  
• *Site access* – particularly where building sites are adjacent to  
busy roads, or in close proximity to existing buildings. Site cir-  
culation, parking, contractor’s site set up, site hoarding, delivery  
and storing of building materials can therefore be restricted. This  
needs to be managed appropriately.  
• *Exposure of harmful elements* – this needs to be considered and  
minimised. Asbestos removal for example is part of the majority  
of refurbishment or demolition projects and requires a specialist  
to be appointed.  
• *Noise, vibration and dust* – this needs to be managed if the  
building is remaining operational. Some medical equipment is  
sensitive to interference, and construction work might need to be  
stopped temporarily.  
• *Wayfinding and accessibility* – public and staff circulation needs  
careful consideration in order to minimise inconvenience and  
confusion. If a main entrance cannot be kept operational at day  
and night, temporary entrances might need to be provided and  
require clear external signage.  
# 4.4 Approvals and benchmarking  
*NHS approval gateways*  
In the NHS, processes have been created to ensure that potential  
investments are scrutinised and undertake a formal sign-off process.  
All projects need to demonstrate that value for money is achieved  
in the use of public funding, and that project risk is understood  
\(which could lead to delay and cost overrun\). This requirement is  
achieved on publicly funded projects, including NHS projects, by  
following the Five Case Model. At each stage, a proposal must  
demonstrate its value by\:  
• Establishing the case for change \(the ‘Strategic Case’\)  
• Demonstrating best public value \(the ‘Economic Case’\)  
• Proving commercial viability \(the ‘Commercial Case’\)  
• Providing evidence that the proposal is affordable \(the ‘Financial  
Case’\)  
• Showing that procedures have been put in place to make sure  
that project delivery is achievable \(the ‘Management Case’\).  
These criteria are applied via a series of approval gateways. At  
each stage, the proposal is refined and more detail is provided, with  
the intent of achieving greater cost certainty and reduced project risk.  
The key NHS approval gateways follow the process defined by  
the HM Treasury Green Book. The precise timing and scope of  
these gateways will vary depending on project size and procure-  
ment route.  
STRATEGIC OUTLINE CASE \(SOC\)  
This first approval process takes place prior to the development of  
the design for the new facility. It will establish the strategic context,  
the service need, the formulation of options, affordability, timeta-  
ble and deliverability. It may be produced prior to the appointment  
of an architect. Any architectural input into the SOC would be  
equivalent to the work required to complete RIBA Workstages 0  
and 1. Where approval is sought for a series of linked business  
cases, a Programme Business Case will be used instead of a SOC,  
with each of the constituent projects being dealt with separately at  
subsequent approval gateways.  
# Hospitals 20-7  
OUTLINE BUSINESS CASE \(OBC\)  
This revisits the SOC in more detail, identifying a preferred option  
which demonstrably optimises value for money. It also sets out the  
likely deal, demonstrates its affordability and details the supporting  
procurement strategy, together with management arrangements for  
the successful rollout of the scheme. Architectural inputs into the  
OBC do not align with the completion of a RIBA workstage. The  
OBC submission would align with the completion of P22 Stage 2/  
BIM Data Drop 2.  
FULL BUSINESS CASE \(FBC\)  
This takes place within the procurement phase of the project,  
following detailed negotiations with potential constructors prior  
to the formal signing of contracts. This is usually the stage at  
which final Treasury approval is required. The purpose of the  
FBC is to revisit the OBC and record the findings of the subse-  
quent procurement activities, together with the recommendation  
for an affordable solution which continues to optimise value for  
money, and detailed arrangements for the successful delivery  
of the project. Architectural input into the FBC would com-  
prise a fully designed scheme equivalent to completing RIBA  
Workstage 4.  
For further information on how the NHS approvals gateways  
correspond to stages in the design development process, see  
Section 6 of the NHS England Five Case Model Consolidated  
Business Case Checklist.  
*Optimism bias*  
In the procurement of healthcare buildings, problems have always  
been encountered when attempting to establish the true costs of a  
project in advance. This is in part to do with projects being reported  
based on the budgets allocated to them and not on their actual cost.  
While coming in over budget suggests a failure in management, in  
many cases cost overruns are due to an underestimation during the  
costing process of site-specific infrastructure costs, such as costs  
associated with unforeseen difficult site conditions and upgrading  
incoming services \(e.g. gas, electricity, etc.\).  
To address this, the NHS introduced the concept of optimism  
bias within its business cases. This is the principle that costs should  
be adjusted upwards to cancel out any ingrained tendency towards  
optimism. Applying this factor generally results in a cost uplift of  
about 30 per cent – this percentage relates to the difference between  
what an initial cost plan will project versus the actual costs gener-  
ally experienced. The allowance made for optimism bias may be  
reduced if it can be demonstrated that project-specific risks have  
been identified and mitigated.  
*NHS design review and benchmarking*  
In order to promote continuous improvement in the delivery of  
healthcare projects, systems have been implemented to review  
and benchmark design quality of NHS procured buildings, and to  
ensure that lessons are learnt on subsequent projects. The princi-  
ple tool to achieve this goal is the Design Quality Indicator \(DQI\)  
toolkit, which is used to measure, evaluate and improve the design  
quality of buildings. This process assesses design quality using the  
following criteria\:  
• *Functionality* – the arrangement, quality and interrelationship of  
spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all.  
• *Build quality* – the engineering performance of the building,  
which includes structural stability and the integration, safety and  
robustness of the systems, finishes and fittings.  
• *Impact* – the building’s ability to create a sense of place and have  
a positive effect on the local community and environment.  
The DQI process involves a number of stakeholders from the  
design team and client body, and building users, and takes the form  
of a facilitated workshop led by a certified facilitator. It can be **20-8 Hospitals**  
used both during the design stages and following completion of  
the facility.  
# 5 METHODOLOGIES  
# 5.1 Evidence-based design  
Evidence-based design is defined as the ‘conscientious, explicit,  
and judicious use of current best evidence from research and  
practice in making critical decisions about the design of each  
individual and unique project’ \(Hamilton and Watkins, *Evidence-*  
*Based Design for Multiple Building Types*, New York, John Wiley  
& Sons, Inc., 2008\).  
The challenge in this is two-fold\:  
• For researchers to measure the more qualitative aspects of design  
and prove the value of aesthetically high-value design; and  
• For designers to access and reference all evidence on very spe-  
cific features/topics \(offered most often as discrete pieces of  
scientific research\) and apply to project-specific needs.  
However, many design aspects are technical, and as such are  
more measurable, such as the benefits of design features including  
single bedrooms, good ventilation, good acoustic environment,  
daylight and nature distractions \(see Review of the Research  
Literature on Evidence-Based Healthcare Design by Roger Ulrich  
et al, in the *Health Environments Research & Design Journal*,  
April 2008\).  
Progress has also been made by researchers in compiling evi-  
dence into databases and guidance ready for designers to use, with  
a notable example in the Sheffield University’s Evidence Base  
cited in Health Building Note 00–01. Adopted by the Department  
of Health as a guidance tool for designers, it organises the broad  
activities occurring in a healthcare setting into a set of tables and  
pictograms linking evidenced outcomes with design considera-  
tions. Activities are considered from both the patient/visitor and  
staff perspective and range from arrival to consultation-examina-  
tion-intervention to meeting and socialising.  
It should be recognised, however, that each project may have  
unique specific needs and priorities and at times evidence can be  
conflicting or inconclusive. To reflect that, there is increasingly  
reference to evidence-influenced design rather than evidence-based  
design.  
• Centralising and grouping activities together to provide a human  
scale to the building which can reduce anxiety, discomfort and  
stress  
• Creating communal spaces for interaction and education  
• Providing high quality working and resting environments for  
staff.  
An example of this approach is the Ambulatory Care and  
Diagnostic \(ACAD\) at Central Middlesex Hospital, Figure 20.2.  
# 5.3 Flexible design  
Change happens in healthcare buildings approximately every 5  
years and buildings need to be future-proofed in order to facilitate  
these future requirements. These can result from\:  
• Change of function requiring new clinical services  
• Change in the model of care requiring different ways of working  
which need to be implemented  
• Change in demographics leading to additional patient capacity,  
occupants, activities and social changes  
• New trends/developments in healthcare technology resulting in  
retrofits to existing hospitals.  
To provide flexibility, a healthcare building needs to be adapt-  
able to allow for the possibility of expansion or contraction. This  
should already have been considered during the strategic planning  
in the design process. Strategies include\:  
*An adaptable structural grid*  
This can allow for a future internal reorganisation of accommo-  
dation. The use of steel and concrete frames provides the greatest  
flexibility. The choice of walls/divisions within the building should  
be adaptable, that is, lightweight.  
# 5.2 Person-centred design  
Person-centred care focuses on understanding a person, their fam-  
ily situation, social circumstances and lifestyles. This methodology  
is tailored to a person’s individual needs and does not only focus  
on treating a condition or illness. It includes sharing decisions with  
patients and helps people to manage their health needs in a working  
partnership with professionals. This can reduce recovery times and  
alleviate pressure on other health and social services.  
Person-centred design changes the design of hospital buildings  
from technical ‘white boxes’ oriented around the medical staff  
to buildings which in themselves support wellness and recovery.  
However, care must also be taken to provide areas and environment  
suitable for the carers and families as well as patients and also, of  
course, the all-important staff.  
This approach can include\:  
• Understanding the nature of the patient experience and their  
journey within a hospital, and ensuring this is clear, light and  
marked with wayfinding ‘events’  
• Providing a therapeutic environment \(Section 9\)  
• Bringing services together to create essential functional relation-  
ships which are more tailored to the individual needs of patients,  
thus reducing journeys through the building and contributing to  
an enhanced visitor experience  
**20.2** *ACAD \(Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic centre\),*  
*Central Middlesex Hospital by Avanti Architects, one of the*  
*first centres in Europe to embody the philosophy of ‘person-*  
*centred care’* *Flexible services*  
For true adaptability, Mechanical, Electrical and Public Health  
\(MEP\) systems should not be embedded in the walls. Services  
\(ventilation\)/plant should ideally be sized to be capable of coping  
with an increased demand in the future.  
*Horizontal expansion*  
This allows the building to increase its footprint. New build areas  
are placed at the perimeter, and where necessary connect to the  
main communication system in order to maintain the internal  
organisation of the hospital.  
*Vertical expansion*  
This can be achieved by providing ‘soft space’ accommodation  
which can easily be relocated \(e.g. offices\), above or below depart-  
ments which are likely to expand.  
*Co-location*  
Flexibility can be achieved by co-locating services that are likely to  
shrink \(e.g. Medical records\) adjacent to services which are likely  
to expand \(e.g. Emergency Department, Radiology\) in order to  
respond to changing requirements in the future.  
# 5.4 Universal design  
Hospitals are often designed with reference to the principles of uni-  
versal design, also called inclusive or barrier-free design. These  
principles aim to make the built environment usable \(to the great-  
est extent possible\) by everyone regardless of their age, physical,  
sensory or mental abilities. This approach can benefit all users,  
for instance good lighting at a reception desk will help those with  
hearing loss who lip-read, the visually impaired and reception staff.  
Acoustic design that minimises background noise helps those with  
impaired hearing, but also helps reduce stress for people with men-  
tal illness, anxious users generally and can help visually impaired  
people to navigate space more easily. See also Chapter 4, Inclusive  
and accessible design.  
In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 and the Equalities Act 2010  
\(Disability\) Regulations enshrines the principles of equality.  
The Building Regulations Approved Document Part M lays out  
guidance on how this should be interpreted in the built envi-  
ronment. Part M has an emphasis on facilitating independent  
access, but within hospitals there is a need to balance design  
for independent access with the often more pertinent need for  
assisted access.  
HBNs sometimes differ from Part M guidance in order to reflect  
the new or temporary nature of patient disability and its acuity.  
Typically, disabled Part M layout toilets will be included within  
main entrance and outpatient areas whereas a mix of en suite and  
assisted bathrooms to Health Building Note layouts will be pro-  
vided within inpatient areas.  
# 6 BUILDING DESIGN AND PLANNING  
# 6.1 Masterplan and development control plan  
A site masterplan shows an overall development concept that  
includes urban design, landscaping, infrastructure, service pro-  
vision, site circulation, present and future land use and building  
forms. Masterplans are usually commissioned by the landowners,  
the hospital trust or local authorities.  
A hospital site masterplan provides a long-term strategy and  
indicates new developments as well as existing buildings and pos-  
sible future phases. It enables an assessment of the capacities of the  
site and how the land can best be used based on the requirements  
established in the brief. Key elements and considerations for the  
development of a masterplan are\:  
• Topography of the site including site levels  
• Site boundaries and neighbouring developments/communities  
# Hospitals 20-9  
• Existing and future infrastructure including access to the site and  
site circulation  
• Proposed new buildings taking into account essential clinical  
adjacencies and ensuring easy identification of entrances  
• Retaining estates and existing refurbished buildings and consid-  
ering how these are linked to new developments  
• Car parking, landscaping and open spaces  
• Identification of expansion zones to provide future flexibility  
• Appropriate phasing and decant strategies.  
Developing a masterplan for a hospital site with existing build-  
ings which might have evolved over decades, requires several  
development stages which inform the final solution of the master-  
plan. The next stage is implementation in the form of a development  
control plan. The masterplan informs the development control plan,  
which contains similar information but provides a greater level of  
detail in terms of building forms, volumes and adjacencies.  
The development control plan provides design guidelines to  
support planning and will be adopted by the authorities. The devel-  
opment control plan is also required for the submission of a final  
business case.  
An example of a masterplan dealing with complex issues is the  
redevelopment of Ulster Hospital in Belfast, Figure 20.3.  
# 6.2 Developing the design brief  
The design brief is one of the most important elements in the whole  
process of delivering a hospital. Developing the brief is a collabo-  
rative process involving the health organisation \(the client\), health  
planners and often also design professionals including architects,  
master planners, engineers and cost consultants with input in early  
testing. The brief development starts with the client’s vision and  
aspirations for the project, often in the context of a masterplan,  
development control plan or other similar framework for devel-  
opment. Throughout a project’s planning stages, the design brief  
will undergo gradual development and will eventually be framed in  
accordance with the preferred and agreed procurement route.  
*Health planning*  
Client and health planner work closely to define\:  
• Capacity requirements \(calculated on current need and future  
need projections, accounting for change in catchment areas,  
demographics and factors like ageing population etc.\)  
• Clinical service needs \(taking into account factors such as those  
mentioned previously\)  
• Model of care \(this derives from client aspirations and opera-  
tional principles informed by capacity and clinical service needs,  
and defines the hierarchy, grouping and organisation of the main  
clinical activity streams\), Figure 20.4  
• Operational policies \(more detailed requirements for each activity  
or clinical specialty in terms of its scope, clinical requirements,  
service users’ considerations, functional relationships with other  
activities, as well as access, service and spatial requirements\)  
• Schedules of accommodation with target areas \(HBNs focus on  
ergonomics of certain clinical activities and these can be used  
as building blocks for room sizing, although this is always sub-  
ject to project-specific requirements and subsequent testing\).  
Recommended ‘best practice’ areas for typical rooms are iden-  
tified in Section 7.3  
• Adjacencies matrix \(this is a standard matrix defining critical  
and desirable adjacency requirements between functional ele-  
ments of the brief\), Figure 20.5  
• Requirements for future flexibility.  
*HBN guidance on developing a design brief*  
HBN 00–01, *General Design Guidance for Healthcare Buildings*  
March 2014, offers healthcare organisations guidance in develop-  
ing a design brief. The document stresses that key decisions in the **20-10 Hospitals**  
development of the brief fall into the sustainability and infection  
control agendas. It also provides a list of example design brief  
issues organised in broad categories \(functionality, impact, build  
quality\) containing prompts for healthcare organisations to explore  
particular design issues. This is offered as a checklist against which  
to organise briefing work.  
*Feasibility*  
Following initial brief development, architects get involved with  
initial tasks to conduct feasibility studies for a specific site \(or  
sites\) and in context with the masterplan/development control plan  
\(where applicable\), client vision and aspirations and against cost.  
This is an iterative process that informs the brief. In the context of  
the RIBA Plan of Work 2020\:  
• Stage 0\: Strategic brief and core project requirements  
• Stage 1\: Project objectives including quality objectives and  
project outcomes, sustainability aspirations, budget and initial  
project brief supported perhaps by feasibility studies and review  
of site information  
• Stage 2\: Agree alterations to brief and issue final project brief.  
# 6.3 Building design process  
*Function and adjacency*  
Hospital building design is function led. The process entails trans-  
forming a clinical diagram \(clinical scheduled area components  
with prescribed adjacencies, flows and access requirements\) into  
a building diagram that organises these components while taking  
into account external drivers \(urban design, masterplan context,  
site opportunities and constraints\) and technical requirements. A  
building diagram, see Figure 20.6, that allows for clear organ-  
isation of functions and appropriate separation of flows, while  
providing for efficient interconnectivity of related areas, is crit-  
ical to the successful development of detailed and coordinated  
design.  
*Stakeholders*  
The hospital building design process also involves a series of itera-  
tions with input from stakeholders. These typically include\:  
• Client clinical/health planning lead  
• Clinical end users  
• Managers of whole-hospital policies in areas such as\:  
− Infection control  
− Facilities management and maintenance  
− Health and safety  
− IT systems infrastructure and implementation  
− Security, etc.  
• Patient groups  
• Charity stakeholders.  
Stakeholder input informs clinical planning, equipment, inte-  
rior finishes design, wayfinding and arts integration, and carries on  
from initial concept to detailed design. This process, traditionally  
branded ‘user-centred’ approach is increasingly moving towards  
‘co-design’, where the stakeholders move from their external posi-  
tion of ‘brief-comment-approve’ more actively into the design  
process.  
The design naturally progresses from large scale to detail, but  
elements of it will feed from a small scale back into the large. Key  
repeating elements \(such as inpatient single bedroom and en suite  
or operating theatre and support spaces\) are often the modules  
requiring detailed design \(and co-design\) and decisions at an early  
stage as they impact on massing, structural design and services  
coordination at a strategic level.  
*Structural choice*  
Civil and structural engineers undertake the assessment of struc-  
tural systems to be implemented in a healthcare building project. All  
building types are possible; however, a framed system allows the  
biggest spans – essential in technical areas of healthcare buildings –  
and the most future flexibility.  
Reinforced in-situ cast concrete structure is popular as a frame  
of columns and beams with reinforced concrete floors, or pref-  
erably flat slab design, where no downstand beams obstruct the  
integration of ducts and other services into the ceiling voids.  
Advantages of concrete construction include resistance to vibra-  
tion, acoustic performance and fire resistance. Steel \(beams and  
columns\) is also used as a structural frame for hospital buildings.  
It is a relatively fast and precise construction; however, much of  
the benefit and more can be lost through the details required to  
achieve fire resistance, acoustic performance and air-tightness  
detailing.  
Decisions are made based on the healthcare services require-  
ments such as the provision of large structural span for large rooms  
such as operating theatres, the use of very heavy equipment such  
as MRI scanners, or the requirement for flat slabs to avoid any det-  
rimental impact on the services distributions in the ceiling voids.  
Many key issues will be taken into account when defining  
which structural framing system will be applied to a healthcare  
building project; for instance, fire, acoustics, construction schedul-  
ing, environmental considerations. Table I illustrates some of these  
key issues.  
*Services*  
MEP services’ coordination also factors in heavily in the iterative  
process – typically 40–45 per cent of volume \(and budget at that\) of  
a hospital build is taken up by services. Another important consid-  
eration \(critically in refurbishment and conversion\) is floor-to-floor  
height since deep ceiling service zones are required in high-tech  
areas. Heights are also influenced by clinical functional/spatial  
requirements and structural systems \(or vice versa for the latter\).  
*Typologies*  
include\:  
Other factors influencing building massing and organisation  
• Horizontal/vertical organising strategies \(determined by func-  
tional relationships, logistics and site area and topography\)  
• Different circulation types \(public, inpatients, staff, facilities  
management \(FM\)\) and best practice appropriateness to context  
• Deep/shallow plan \(high-tech acute areas typically dictate deep  
plan while inpatient or outpatient low-tech accommodation com-  
prising smaller modules and high percentage of rooms where  
daylight is essential drives shallow plan arrangements\)  
• Proportion, distribution and connections between high-tech and  
low-tech zones \(high-tech is defined as heavily serviced inter-  
vention and diagnostic areas; low-tech as outpatient consulting  
or inpatient accommodation areas\)  
• Trend towards 100 per cent single room accommodation  
\(increasing shallow plan and building perimeter\)  
• Stacking of ‘like’ function versus horizontal distribution.  
An example of different massing response options is shown in  
Figure 20.7.  
*Infection prevention and control*  
The control of infection is a vital part of healthcare provision,  
and measures include behavioural and procedural ones \(includ-  
ing the frequent washing of hands, use of alcohol gel and access  
restrictions\) to design tactics \(all surfaces should be accessible to  
cleaning teams\).  
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, infection prevention  
and control guidance in all healthcare settings is being reviewed and **Hospitals 20-11**

85% is recycled \(according to British publication *Building*\)  
revised. All services require new ways of working during the con-  
tinued pandemic and in future. During the pandemic, Public Health  
Bodies in the UK have jointly issued updates to guidance based  
upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion. Following  
the pandemic, the lessons learnt will form the basis of new ways of  
working designed to mitigate the impact of a further event of simi-  
lar or greater magnitude. The outcome of this process will in some  
instances necessitate changes in how hospitals are designed.  
It should be recognised that infection by different pathogens can  
be minimised by different methods. Alcohol gel, for example, can  
work against MRSA but not C. Difficile, which requires meticulous  
hand washing. The design of the environment cannot in itself elim-  
inate the risk of infection, but the strategic placement of hand-wash  
basins and alcohol gel dispensers can enable good management by  
encouraging good practice. Horizontal surfaces which are difficult  
to clean represent a hazard. Radiused skirtings and the elimination  
of inaccessible areas, behind WCs for example, assist a cleaning  
regime in being effective.  
The presence of highly infectious and dangerous pathogens  
such as MRSA and C. Difficile is a constant concern as are those  
associated with air and water supplies such as legionella and pseu-  
donomas. Designers should take advice from medical and infection  
control experts at all stages of the design process and in addition  
pursue a wider engagement with estates and housekeeping teams  
on the implications of infection control design decisions made.  
Examples of infection control consultation at the various design  
stages include\:  
• Preparation and brief \(RIBA Stage 1\) – department adjacencies,  
support services for sterile supplies, disposal, etc.  
• Concept design \(RIBA Stage 2\) – input into the brief for iso-  
lation facilities, utility rooms, sanitary facilities, staff change  
facilities, engineering services, adequate storage, etc.  
• Developed design \(RIBA Stage 3\) – sign off on the location of  
hand wash stations, specification of internal finishes and fittings  
• Technical design and construction \(RIBA Stages 4 and 5\) – input  
into the quality control process particularly with regard to prod-  
uct substitutions and elements of contractor design.  
# 7 CLINICAL PLANNING  
# 7.1 Clinical planning process  
Not to be confused with health planning, clinical planning describes  
the process of architecturally planning a healthcare building. What  
differentiates it from plan development of other building types is  
the particularly complex logistics of organising clusters of func-  
tional space and the networks that connect them. Clinical planning  
entails mapping of adjacencies, functional relationships and flows  
\(the movement of patients, public, staff and goods\) onto stacked  
plan diagrams with the aim of achieving optimum briefed clinical  
adjacencies – horizontally or vertically – and organising access and  
circulation, Figure 20.8.  
This collaborative and iterative process engages health planners  
and stakeholders and moves from the briefing stage with a progres-  
sive increase in detail\:  
• *Bubble diagrams*\: Scaled diagrams of schedule components  
organised to achieve briefed adjacencies. This starts horizon-  
tally, then progresses to identify potential footprints and vertical  
organisation, Figure 20.9.  
• *1\:500-scale adjacencies, functional relationships and circula-*  
*tion diagrams*\: Mapping of components \(traditionally identified  
as hospital departments\) in plan, section and stacking diagram  
showing relationships, access requirements, entrances and  
different circulation routes \(the latter are referred to as commu-  
nication, while circulation describes the corridors within each  
individual department\), Figure 20.10.  
• *1\:200-scale adjacencies*\: These are plan diagrams of departments  
organising adjacencies and functional relationships of rooms or  
clusters of rooms within a department. Same principles apply as to  
larger scale with requirements for separation of entrance/public face  
areas from clinical or ‘back-of-house’, discrete access for inpatients  
or emergency and separation of clean from dirty, Figure 20.11.  
• *1\:200-scale plans \(or 1\:100 for smaller projects\)*\: These are the  
concept design plans \(typically developed at RIBA Stage 2 of a  
project\), Figure 20.12.  
• *Room data sheets \(RDS\)*\: Data on every room in the building  
is assembled in a set of room data sheets. These are compiled  
from a set of typical room types that exist in the DoH Activity  
Database \(ADB\) and are usually modified to suit particular pro-  
ject needs. The set comprises\:  
− Room data sheet, describing the activities, personnel and plan-

# 7.2 Schedule of accommodation  
A schedule of drawn areas often referred to as the SoA \(Schedule of  
Accommodation\) follows alongside plan development, from target  
areas to net as-drawn areas \(to be tested and agreed with stakeholders  
where they deviate from the guidance targets\) and departmental  
gross internal \(drawn\) areas \(GIA\). An often-underestimated 30–50  
per cent increase from the total of net areas to drawn GIA is typical  
for new builds and that is usually exceeded in a refurbishment or  
conversion by varying factors dependent on the existing building  
configuration. This is distributed usually as follows\:  
• Planning \(allowance for walls, service drops, etc\)\: 5 per cent  
• Engineering \(allowance for service zones and cupboards within  
clinical zones – not overall plant provision\)\: 3 per cent  
• Circulation \(within departments\)\: 25–35 per cent – this varies  
as some clinical areas plan more efficiently than others, mostly  
depending on separation of flows requirements  
• Communication \(circulation areas linking departments\)\: 10–20  
per cent  
• Refurbishment factor \(allowance for inefficient planning due to  
existing shell configuration, servicing and links to other accom-  
modation\)\: 5–15 per cent.  
The experience of the Covid-19 pandemic will inform reviews to  
assess whether established area allowances need to be modified in  
order to enable appropriate operational procedures to be adopted to  
mitigate the impact of future pandemics. The effect of social distanc-  
ing on occupancy capacities \(for instance for waiting areas and office  
accommodation\), requiring either increases in area allowances, or  
temporary reductions in capacity, will need to be considered. Social  
distancing requirements and the need to segregate routes in order to  
enforce separation of patient pathways for those either with, or with-  
out, the infection that has caused a pandemic may also necessitate an  
increase to circulation and communication area allowances.

Front door for patients who require specialised emergency care. Patients either walk in or are brought in by ambulance.  
Department is divided into treatment clusters based on severity of injury and length of stay\:  
– Reception, waiting area and first assessment/triage  
– Minor injuries – treatment cubicles/rooms for walk-in patients  
– Major injuries – treatment cubicles/rooms for more severely injured patients plus facilities for a major incident  
– Observation unit – extended stay for patients requiring monitoring  
– Resuscitation – treatment bays for lifesaving activities  
– Children’s unit  
– Specialist rooms for ophthalmology, orthopaedic or fracture clinic  
– Staff, relative areas and support  
Often embedded in community and primary care services but also in acute hospital settings, they provide a service to  
deal with more minor issues which can be kept out of the main flows of A&E  
Imaging facilities consist of different modalities; some are for diagnosis only, others include treatment\:  
– General X-ray uses electromagnetic radiation to create still images of mainly bones and joints and occasionally  
internal organs  
– Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of internal organs  
– CT to produce images of bones, internal organs and blood vessels. Can determine location, size and shape of tumours  
– Nuclear medicine includes SPECT CT and Gamma camera. Patient receives injection of small amount of  
radioactive material.  
– MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to scan any part of the body  
– Fluoroscopy produces real time video images of dynamic body functions  
Testing to diagnose issues involving the heart and or lungs; can be stationary or include exercise\:  
– Electrocardiography \(ECG\)  
– Echocardiograms \(echo\)  
– Pulmonary function tests  
Investigation in which an instrument is introduced into the body to give a view of its internal parts  
Intervention includes surgical operations on patients in a sterile environment. It includes surgical and some  
diagnostic procedures\:  
– Operating theatre is part of a suite including anaesthetic, clean preparation room, scrub room and a dirty utility  
– Following procedure, patients recover in two stages prior to transferal to inpatient accommodation or discharge  
home \(day procedures\)  
Many interventions are carried out within a day. The flows through a day surgery unit are therefore different from a  
main operating theatre suite  
Endoscopy is used for treatment and intervention as well as diagnostics. This may take place in an operating theatre  
for major interventions  
Includes thoracic diagnostic and interventional procedures  
Involves high-energy radiation to treat tumours or blood disorders  
Patients with kidney failure have their blood cleaned though a dialysis machine. They usually attend three days a  
week for four hours a day  
Outpatients consist of general and specialist clinics, which can be co-located for flexible use of rooms\:  
– General outpatients  
– Oral surgery/orthodontics  
– Ophthalmology  
– ENT \(Ears, Nose, Throat\) and audiology  
– Children  
– Cancer care/haematology  
– Renal services  
– Endoscopy  
– Main accommodation for outpatients includes rooms for consultation, examination and treatment  
Hospitals typically have anything between 300 and 1200 beds. This is often quoted as measure of the size of a  
hospital.  
Wards can be generic \(surgical or medical\) or specialised, e.g. stroke, renal, elderly, gynaecology or trauma.  
Patients are accommodated in single bedrooms or multi-bed bays  
ICU/HDU provide intensive treatment medicine to patients with severe and life-threatening illnesses and injuries  
This range of services is sometimes provided independently and sometimes falls into the general provision of high/  
low-tech facilities within the hospital. It includes\:  
– Outpatients  
– Antenatal services  
– Maternity  
– Operating theatres  
– Inpatient care  
Includes activities with or without equipment to improve physical movement after an injury or illness, e.g. exercise  
bars, treadmill. It may also involve exercises carried out in water \(Hydrotherapy\)  
Helps patients to address difficulties with everyday tasks and aims to achieve practical solutions to gain  
independency. This can be practised in e.g. Activities of Daily Living kitchens or bedrooms  
Includes activities to help patients with communication, speech and language difficulties  
ADL facilities provide training for relearning skills required to live at home for stroke or trauma patients  
This includes consumables stores, equipment stores, clean utility, dirty utility and clinical offices \(which must be  
co-located with the clinical areas\)  
These areas are outside of the clinical departments and are usually shared throughout the hospital. They are FM areas  
such as estates department, pathology services, pharmacy department, Clean and Sterile Services Department  
\(CSSD\), café, restaurant, kitchens, waste disposal, etc. **20-18 Hospitals**

**20.15** *Organisational principles for theatres department and relationship with critical care and surgical inpatients* Typical room areas are also identified in Table III, which is  
compiled by using current and past guidance and best practice  
and tested examples. Some of these typical area allowances may  
increase following post-Covid-19 reviews to assess how measures  
such as social distancing can mitigate the impact of pandemics  
by reducing infection risk, and also by reinforcing the ability of  
the hospital to continue to deliver its full range of services while  
responding to a pandemic.  
Adjacencies and other relationships, access requirements and  
flows distribution or separation differ from project to project, often  
significantly. Also, in the context of the fast-changing healthcare  
sector, new elements and new priorities emerge frequently. It is  
therefore very difficult to prescribe functional relationships in  
healthcare buildings. However, Table IV offers a general guide of  
typical relationships. Key space requirements for clinical and sup-  
port activities are provided in Figures 20.16 to 20.18.  
# 7.4 Ward design/single rooms  
Since the general trend in healthcare delivery is for treatment to be  
delivered within the community whenever possible, patients who  
are admitted to hospitals are often acutely ill and may have multiple  
conditions.  
Consideration needs to be given to\:  
• Departmental relationships – critical care beds are often the  
beds sited closest to operating theatres; specialist wards such as  
oncology may be sited close to specialist diagnostic and treat-  
ment facilities \(but not always as these may be shared with  
outpatients\).  
• Vertical adjacencies – wards stacked in a tower provide oppor-  
tunities for consistent planning of accommodation, flexibility in  
allocation of beds, ease of maintenance and servicing.  
• Horizontal adjacencies – internal streets or atria often incorpo-  
rating reception and information points, commercial and social  
spaces \(cafes, pharmacy, shops, etc.\) are replacing the traditional  
hospital corridor.  
The move towards a more patient-led healthcare system has  
begun to be reflected in initiatives around\:  
• Patient choice including the environment and facilities for  
healthcare treatment  
• Recognition of difference in personal values, beliefs and rela-  
tionships  
• Privacy and dignity  
• Same-sex accommodation.  
Same-sex accommodation can be provided in\:  
• Same-sex wards, where the whole ward is occupied by men or  
women only  
• Single rooms, Figure 20.19  
• Mixed wards, where men and women are in separate bays or  
rooms.  
Ward designs typically combine\:  
• Inpatient accommodation \(bed and sanitary facilities and staff  
touchdown spaces\) to include isolation accommodation  
• Patient support facilities  
• Storage spaces  
• Utilities  
• Administration and staff facilities.  
The balance of facilities provided will reflect the provision of  
facilities elsewhere in the hospital and locally, the demands of  
different specialisms and the desire for standard layouts, the bal-  
ance of multi-bed or single rooms. An organisation diagram to  
# Hospitals 20-19  
interrogate, develop and record the agreed brief will need to con-  
firm the requirement for facilities.  
*Factors to consider*  
• Access to the ward – ward entrances need to consider access  
control for visitors, patients and staff. Public entrance to a ward  
can be achieved by a manned reception desk or staff base, and/or  
remote entry system. A second ‘back door’ may be provided for  
discrete patient transfers and FM services.  
• Clustering of patients within a ward – for instance a ward of  
24 beds may be organised in clusters of 8 beds perhaps as 100  
per cent single bedrooms or a mix of one four-bed bay and four  
single rooms.  
• Evidence for all single or a mix of single and multi-bed rooms  
is vigorously debated. Arguments are often nuanced and inter-  
linked and the optimum choice may vary for different projects  
and patient groups.  
• Sociability and privacy – single bedrooms can encourage family  
members to spend more time with the patient, but a patient with-  
out visitors can feel isolated and ignored; multi-bed wards can  
foster support between fellow patients or disturb patients’ ability  
to rest and sleep undisturbed.  
• Patient safety – in multi-bed wards patients will often alert the  
nursing staff to patients requiring attention while in single bed-  
rooms family members will often be on hand to supervise trips  
to the toilet.  
• Clinical observation – balanced with the patient’s need for pri-  
vacy and dignity.  
• Bed management – single rooms facilitate bed management as  
issues such as gender mix on adult wards or age mix on chil-  
dren’s wards are avoided.  
• Availability of single rooms reduces the need to move patients  
and there is some evidence that this helps to reduce incidents  
of slips, trips and falls, medication errors and the spread of  
infection.  
• Infection control – the spread of airborne pathogens between  
patients is less in single rooms. There is less risk to others from  
patient beds being cleaned on change over, and single rooms are  
more suited to the more effective vapour disinfection methods.  
There is some evidence that single rooms impact hand wash-  
ing behaviour by reducing incidents of staff not washing hands  
between attending different patients. While it will take time for a  
consensus to be reached regarding lessons learnt from the Covid-  
19 pandemic, the result may be an increase in the proportion of  
single rooms across hospital estates.  
• Mixed single and multi-bed room types have the potential for  
‘patient choice’; a powerful contribution to feelings of well-  
being, Figure 20.20.  
• Single room with en suite – layouts with outboard en suites tend  
to reduce natural light and views to the external world; layouts  
with inboard en suites tend to restrict clinical observation from  
outside the room; layouts with inline en suites usually lead to  
mirrored room arrangements, Figure 20.21.  
• Facilities should reflect nursing practices – the recent trend is  
towards reduced time spent at centralised staff bases and more at  
touch down spaces at or near the bedside.  
• Distances staff need to walk to check and treat patients, write up  
and access patient treatment records and access support spaces.  
• Hoists for moving and handling patients.  
• Where 100 per cent single rooms are briefed, a dedicated treat-  
ment room may not be required as treatments can be provided at  
the bedside.  
• Post-Covid 19, in all settings, the manner in which designs  
address issues including the segregation of clean and dirty  
activities, the isolation of infectious patients, and infec-  
tion prevention via distance and by separation of circulation  
flows will be reviewed and may change from current typical  
approaches. **20-20 Hospitals**

# 8.1 Introduction  
Modern settings for mental health care have distinct characteristics  
that set them apart from medical hospital facilities. However, just  
as with the medical hospital, in mental health there are clinical,  
operational and qualitative concerns that underpin organisation,  
planning and design of new facilities.  
Note that this section does not cover sub-specialties of mental  
health that have very specific needs, such as forensic mental health,  
child and adolescent mental health, dementias, learning disabilities  
and complex neurological disorders.  
# 8.2 Context  
Mental health problems are a growing public concern. Nearly half  
\(43.4 per cent\) of adults think that they have had a diagnosable  
mental health condition at some point in their life \(35.2 per cent of  
men and 51.2 per cent of women\).  
Mental illness has both an economic and a social cost as well as  
diminishing well-being of individuals and carers affected. Certain  
parts of the population are at a higher risk of mental health prob-  
lems because of greater exposure and vulnerability to unfavourable  
social, economic and environmental circumstances. Black, Asian  
and minority ethnic communities are also generally considered to  
be at increased risk of poor mental health.  
# 8.3 Guidance and standards  
In addition to medical hospital guidance \(see Section 3\), there are  
a range of facility standards and guidance particularly relevant for  
the planning, design and commissioning of mental health facilities\:  
• Health Building Note Designing Health and Community Care  
Buildings \(HBN 00–01\)  
• Health Building Note Efficient Management of Healthcare  
Estate and Facilities \(HBN 00–08\)  
• Health Building Note Adult Mental Health Units\: Planning and  
Design \(HBN 03–01\)  
• Standards for Inpatient Mental Health Services, published by the  
Royal College of Psychiatrists \(2015\)  
• Laying the foundations for better acute mental health, Department  
of Health and Care Services Improvement Partnership Acute  
Care Programme \(2008\)  
• National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care & Low  
Secure Units \(napicu.org.uk\) guidance.  
Mental health charities including Mind \(www.mind.org.uk\) and  
Time to Change \(www.time-to-change.org.uk\) are also sources of  
valuable advice on the needs of specific care groups.  
# 8.4 Care groups and services  
*Outpatient accommodation*  
The majority of mental healthcare in the UK takes place at home  
or in an outpatient setting. The type of facility used can vary and is  
often associated with a community mental health team base, which  
would require flexible and often open plan administrative office  
space, shared ‘touchdown’ facilities for outreach staff and confi-  
dential communication space where mental health care workers can  
talk to service users.  
Consultation, diagnosis, therapy and treatments should be  
accommodated in local and accessible primary and community  
health facilities. Planning should take account of the wide range  
of often incompatible service groups, for example vulnerable  
children with mental illness can find disinhibited adult behaviour  
disturbing. Layouts should have a single managed entrance but  
be able to cater for different patient groups being cared for in  
distinct areas.  
# Hospitals 20-27  
Outpatient services require the following patient accommoda-  
tion described in Section 8.7 ‘Key rooms’\:  
• Mental health consultation room  
• Mental health group room \(dry and wet\)  
• Medical treatment room with clean and dirty utility rooms.  
*Inpatient accommodation*  
Mental health inpatient accommodation is grouped into four types.  
Each type represents a tier of physical risk and requires different  
treatments\:  
• Private patient accommodation, bedrooms, toilets and washrooms  
• Public patient accommodation, day rooms, lounges, dining areas  
and main circulation  
• Supervised accommodation, treatment, therapy and amenity spaces  
• Staff only accommodation, administration, offices and support  
accommodation.  
The basic components are\:  
• Wards which comply with the residential component  
• Therapy, treatment and amenity areas which may be shared  
between wards  
• Administrative and support accommodation.  
The quality of physical environment plays a crucial role in achiev-  
ing positive clinical outcomes for service users, staff and the wider  
community. An adult inpatient environment should provide a famil-  
iar, safe environment with ‘hotel-like’ levels of comfort and privacy.  
*Adult mental health*  
Inpatient accommodation for adults with mental illness is the most  
common form of mental hospital. The focus is on stabilising what  
may have been a chaotic period for the patient, developing a per-  
sonal care plan and jointly managing recovery to a point where an  
individual can return home. It is good practice to provide accommo-  
dation that can flex and adapt to cater for a wide range of services.  
This may mean clustering or grouping of inpatient accommodation.  
Adult inpatient facilities are generally arranged in wards of  
12–18 bedrooms each with en suite WC and shower room. There  
should be appropriate levels of security to enable supervision and  
control of access and egress from the unit.  
*Frail and elderly mental health*  
Care pathways for older adults with mental illness can be complex  
and generally mean longer periods of stay in an inpatient facility.  
The focus is still on jointly managing recovery to a point where an  
individual can return home, but may also need to address physical  
ailments and some loss of cognitive function.  
Older adult inpatient facilities are generally arranged in wards of  
16–20 bedrooms each with en suite WC and shower room. Particular  
attention should be paid to providing handrails, grab rails in WCs  
and ironmongery hardware which is both easy to grasp and offers  
reduced ligature opportunities. Movement, parking and charging of  
mobility scooters should be considered in the layout. This group is  
likely to require some bariatric standard facilities. Staff will need  
hoists built in or storage facilities to be located locally.  
Maintaining physical activity is particularly important.  
Movement and access to gardens should be encouraged, but care  
should be taken to avoid trip hazards, and boundaries need clear  
physical delineation. Access and egress should have appropriate  
levels of security for this group to enable supervision.  
*Addictions and substance abuse*  
Specialist inpatient units are uncommon, but they have distinctive  
requirements. Admission to an inpatient unit is likely to be for a  
short period, usually one to two weeks, during which medically  
supervised withdrawal management may be provided. **20-28 Hospitals**  
**20.22** *Building typologies for basic single storey plan*  
Units are usually small, 6–12 beds each, with en suite WC and  
shower room in a broader mental health setting. Particular attention  
should be paid to access panels, fittings and grilles to reduce oppor-  
tunities for the concealment of drugs.  
As these units have a limited staffing compliment, the design  
should maximise opportunities for sharing support, therapy and  
amenity resources with other units so that patients are not unduly  
disadvantaged.  
*Psychiatric intensive care*  
Psychiatric intensive care is for patients who are in an acutely dis-  
turbed phase of a serious mental disorder. A Psychiatric Intensive  
Care Unit \(PICU\) forms an important and specialised component  
of adult inpatient care.  
A PICU is generally a small self-contained facility of 6–12 beds  
associated with one or more adult inpatient units. Integral therapy  
accommodation should be multi-functional and materials, compo-  
nents and finishes must be robust and securely fixed.  
For guidance, see *PICU National Minimum Standards* \(2014\)  
published by National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care &  
Low Secure Units.  
# 8.5 Organising principles  
A mental health inpatient unit should be organised to cater for a  
wide variety of functions and interactions. Unlike a medical set-  
ting, mental health patients are mostly out of bed and moving  
between activities. A well-organised setting distinguishes between  
patient day spaces and bed areas, groups staff and support areas,  
and provides an easily navigable circulation system.  
*Building typologies*  
Buildings are typically organised as variants of the following plan  
arrangements \(Figure 20.22\)\:  
• Cruciform  
• Tee or Y form  
• Courtyard.  
*Recovery focused*  
Environment plays a role in aiding recovery. The quality of design  
communicates important values to patients, staff and visitors. A  
familiar scale environment that can be easily understood and  
navigated helps rebuild self-confidence and supports the many  
treatments and therapies available.  
*Therapeutic environment*  
The term ‘therapeutic environment’ describes a setting where the  
surroundings support a sense of individual well-being which under-  
pins recovery \(see Section 9\).  
*Safety and security*  
Safety and security are often considered together, but are distinct  
requirements. Personal safety for patients who may be suicidal  
means reducing opportunities for violence and self-harm. By  
categorising spaces in tiers of risk \(see Section 8.4\), appropriate  
levels of safe design can be applied. For example, patient bedrooms  
should have anti-ligature features for door and window ironmon-  
gery. Fixtures and furniture should be selected or designed to be  
both robust to avoid breakages being used as weapons, and safe to  
avoid self-harm. However, there is a balance to be struck between  
risk reduction through safe design features and promoting recovery  
by incorporating familiar domestic and attractive components.  
Security should be considered in three interdependent ways\:  
• Physical security which determines the boundaries, fabric,  
access-control systems, etc.  
• Operational security which caters for safe methods and systems  
such as admission, food delivery, maintenance  
• Relational security which determines the balance between intru-  
siveness and openness and governs trust between individuals.  
Each of these matters should be considered separately and  
together. In particular, relational security will determine the organ-  
isation of circulation space and lines of observation. Operational  
security should be considered carefully in detailing managed  
escape in case of fire \(see also Section 10\).  
*Privacy and dignity*  
Quality of life and a sense of self-worth underpin a sense of mental  
well-being. Same-sex accommodation and single bedrooms are a  
requirement for adult inpatient wards. Individuals should be able to  
mitigate the effects of living in a restricted space with strangers, by  
preserving privacy, dignity and control over the environment as far  
as possible. Particular care should be taken with mitigating noise  
between bedrooms and providing for quieter spaces for reflection.  
Where monitoring systems such as CCTV and occupancy detec-  
tion are used, these should be considered alongside the NHS CCTV  
Code of Practice. Although it is common for male and female ward units to be entirely  
distinct, it is possible for gender separation to be arranged in a single  
ward unit as long as occupants can access all the key facilities without  
passing through residential space occupied by a different gender group.  
*Flexibility and adaptability*  
Mental health facilities should be able to accommodate shifts in demand.  
Inpatient wards may be designed with four or six bed sub-clusters of  
bedrooms that could cater for a wide range of differing care groups.  
# 8.6 Planning and design  
When considering a site for a mental health facility, the designer  
should have a clear sense of the public frontage and private spaces.  
The more public zones should address matters of stigma and image  
by providing a direct and encouraging route to an identifiable  
entrance. Private zones offer inpatients opportunities for amenity  
and relaxation without being overlooked by the public.  
The organisation of the components of a psychiatric inpatient  
unit should show a clear distinction between residential ward  
accommodation, day therapy and sports areas and support accom-  
modation. Entrances and exits should be limited and carefully  
considered in respect of safely and security.  
*Location, boundaries, neighbours and stigma*  
The selection of an appropriate location for an inpatient unit should  
consider\:  
• Accessibility for the patient and staff population served  
• Size of the site and availability of level access gardens to inpatients  
• Compatibility of existing local users, for example an adjoining  
primary school would be likely to provoke public disquiet.  
Psychiatric hospitals are often the target of the stigma often asso-  
ciated with mental illness. The designer should consider features  
that challenge stigma by communicating well-being and openness.  
These include landscaped gardens, public art and a well-illuminated  
entrance. Visible fencing enclosures should be avoided.  
*Accessibility*  
It is important to consider accessibility for mental health inpatients  
in the broadest sense as illness itself may contribute to disability.  
Some medication may reduce cognitive ability so the design should  
have features such as contrasting architraves and skirting boards to  
help navigation.  
The designer should pay particular attention to providing  
accessibility features such as grab rails in a manner that reduces  
opportunities for self-harm. In some instances, this may require  
rails to be removable.  
*Circulation and graduated territory*  
The inpatient environment should encourage recovery and self-con-  
fidence. The term graduated territory is used to describe a feature of  
planning where space is allowed at the border between areas where  
different levels of social interaction are expected. For example, a  
bedroom is personal space, the corridor outside is more public. A  
slight recess or lowering of the ceiling delineates a threshold. This  
manipulation of space reflects the social transaction of moving  
from one space to another. Having a threshold is comforting and  
encourages the patient to choose their next step.  
This form of circulation planning can be used between private/  
semi-public and semi-public/public areas.  
*Engineering, controls and maintenance*  
Heating, ventilation and electrical systems can all represent a risk.  
Horizontal and vertical services distribution should be contained in  
ducts with limited access. Controls, switches and ventilation grilles  
should be anti-ligature specification in high-risk areas.  
Maintenance access should be planned as part of the operational  
security strategy. Where maintenance staff \(with tools that may  
# Hospitals 20-29  
represent a risk in themselves\) are required to enter a patient envi-  
ronment, they must be accompanied by a trained member of staff.  
*Interior design*  
Interior design and careful selection of furniture and fittings con-  
tributes to the overall quality of the environment and endows a  
sense of self-worth and purpose on those who occupy the space.  
The designer should focus on providing a ‘hotel-like’ setting with  
modulation of lighting, colour and materials working with the func-  
tional and operational constraints of providing a safe, robust and  
manageable setting. Grilles, general light fittings and soft acoustic  
finishes should be out of reach. Fixings on furniture should be tam-  
per-proof and artwork securely fixed.  
*Landscape design*  
Nature has a valuable therapeutic role. Access to gardens widens the  
range of activities available to patients and can encourage healthy life-  
styles. In a busy, self-contained environment gardens offer a valuable  
opportunity for solitude and reflection. Maintenance should be consid-  
ered as part of operational security and hard landscape materials should  
be monolithic if possible to avoid paving being used as weapons.  
# 8.7 Key rooms  
The organisation of functional zones and pattern of circulation deter-  
mine how well the building meets the objectives of the model of care.  
*Mental health consulting room*  
Unlike a medical consultation room, this will not have a patient  
couch. It will have a round table and two or more chairs and a desk  
with an IT workstation. Floor finishes are often carpeted and col-  
ours selected to be calming.  
*Mental health group room*  
Group rooms cater for groups of 6–12 patients and provide for a wide  
range of therapies including talking, cognitive behaviour, occupa-  
tional therapies, etc. They often need storage attached and are best  
viewed as multi-functional rooms with wet and dry variants.  
*Mental health bedroom*  
The mental health inpatient bedroom has evolved into a commonly  
accepted model with the en suite WC and shower room splayed to  
allow clear observation from the bedroom door and access to the  
drainage and plumbing from the corridor \(see Figure 20.23\).  
*Bedroom design and layout issues*  
• Patient privacy/dignity vs observation – extent of views into  
room from door  
• Extent of anti-ligature concerns/measures  
• Control of access to perimeter – privacy and security  
• Control of environment – light/heat/cooling/ventilation – patient  
vs staff control  
• Services access from outside room  
• Views out of room  
• Inboard or outboard en suites – light and ventilation  
• Swing of door  
• Control of access to en suite  
• En suite door lockable in open position?  
• Division of room into day and night zones  
• Positioning of bed  
• Seating and work space/desk  
• Storage – clothes and possessions  
• TV positioning – good viewing angles  
• Reduce climbing possibilities  
• Noise transfer between bedrooms  
• Construction complexity  
• Robustness of construction, fixtures, finishes and furniture  
• Ease of inspection  
• Ease of cleaning/maintenance. **20-30 Hospitals**  
**20.23** *Mental health bedroom design and layout*

*Section 136 suite*  
A Section 136 suite is a ‘Place of Safety’ under the mental health  
acts. It should be located to allow a police car or ambulance to park  
nearby.  
*Seclusion room*  
Secluding a patient can be a traumatic experience and may lead to  
harm for the patient involved. Inadequate seclusion facilities can  
make the experience worse.  
# 9 THERAPEUTIC DESIGN  
# 9.1 Well-being  
It has long been asserted that the quality of the environment has an  
impact on the physical and mental well-being of both patients and  
staff, and that this leads to improved clinical outcomes.  
Recent research has shown quantitative measurable outcomes  
such as reduced uptake of pain medication due to qualitative  
improvements in the environment encompassed by a holistic and  
integrated approach to therapeutic design including\:  
• Wayfinding  
• Interior design  
• Lighting design  
• Art  
• Landscape design.  
# 9.2 Wayfinding  
Wayfinding to and within hospitals should address the differ-  
ent needs of a wide variety of users – patients, staff and visitors  
including those who arrive stressed at a critical point in their lives,  
whether happy or sad. This includes people of all ages and many  
cultural backgrounds, regardless of physical or sensory ability \(see  
Section 5.4 ‘Universal design’\), those who use the hospital regu-  
larly, and those arriving for the first time.  
Wayfinding design should fit within the NHS or other private  
branding strategy. It should start before patients or visitors arrive  
on site with, for example, consistent site, building and department  
names used on website and appointment letters.  
Once on site, wayfinding should be as intuitive as possi-  
ble, incorporating clear pathways leading to easily identifiable  
entrances, with signage used to re-enforce a logical site or building  
diagram. Views from inside to outside can help orientation. Visual  
and physical clutter should be kept to a minimum to promote unim-  
peded access and establish a legible environment. There should be  
a hierarchy for the presentation of information, and a controlled  
and orderly background for wayfinding decision points which may  
include place-markers such as works of art.  
In recent years, digital technologies have become available that  
can support wayfinding and remove potential stressful or confusing  
aspects of a hospital visit. Smartphone Apps can assist the patient  
and carers at each stage of a hospital attendance from travel to the  
hospital, through check in and to attendance at a clinic. Digital tech-  
nologies have the potential to address many of the issues that have  
in the past often made visiting hospital an intimidating, frustrating  
and disempowering process. The use of these technologies may  
in time have a significant impact on how hospitals are designed,  
for instance by reducing the need for waiting areas. They should  
always be thought of by the designer of the physical environment  
as an aid to use, however, rather than as a replacement for the clar-  
ity created by a well-considered design.  
# 9.3 Interior design  
Research has shown that patients, including children, will often  
draw connections between the quality, order and cleanliness of  
the healthcare environment and their own care. Aspects of the design have been shown to act directly on clinical outcomes, for  
instance\:  
• Natural light – this has been demonstrated to improve recovery  
rates in ICU, to maintain circadian rhythms in both patients and  
staff, and to promote production of vitamin D \(low levels of vita-  
min D have been linked to dementia\).  
• Therapeutic views – views of nature and/or human activity have  
been shown to increase speed of recovery.  
• Acoustic design – incorporation of acoustically absorptive sur-  
faces appropriate for infection control will promote rest and sleep  
in an increasingly noisy technological healthcare environment.  
The ability of the user to have some control over their envi-  
ronment, particularly temperature, ventilation and light, is highly  
valued.  
# 9.4 Lighting  
Integrated natural and artificial lighting design needs to address not  
only technical aspects \(sustainability, life cycle costs, light levels  
and colour rendering required for clinical process\) but also the ther-  
apeutic agenda. This includes appropriate user control and variation  
in light levels over time to support circadian rhythms. Lighting may  
also be used to support different functions within an area, such as  
a single bedroom used both for minor clinical procedure and rest  
and recovery, which therefore requires both clinical observation of  
a patient at night and uninterrupted patient sleep.  
# 9.5 Art  
Access to appropriate works of art have been found to be highly  
beneficial in terms of providing a positive, welcoming and engag-  
ing healthcare environment. Many different forms of art have been  
found to help support patient and staff well-being including sculp-  
tural objects, paintings, prints, photographs, moving image, music,  
soundscape, tactile pieces, poetry and spoken word.  
Integration is a key aspect in the successful use of art for ther-  
apeutic design, with hospitals often commissioning art alongside  
refurbishment or new building projects. Ongoing art in hospital  
programmes can add hugely to the life of the healthcare commu-  
nity.  
# 9.6 Landscape  
Access to external spaces whether landscape, courtyard or balcony  
are valued by patients, visitors and staff, and can provide wel-  
come relief from often necessarily clinical interior environments.  
External spaces can include facilities such as a terrace attached to a  
café, play spaces for children, rehabilitation areas or quiet gardens  
for remembrance or reflection. Multi-sensory design including  
scented plants and encouraging insect and bird-life can provide  
interest and help reduce stress for staff, patients and visitors.  
# 10 SPECIFICATION  
# 10.1 Infection control  
Infection control is one of the key principles behind the design of  
hospital interiors – it is vital that healthcare associated infections  
\(HCAIs\) are kept to a minimum. Infection control input should be  
included at all stages of the design from feasibility studies to post  
project evaluation.  
Advice will range from space/sizing, requirements for specialist  
areas, siting of linen, waste, cleaning and hand hygiene facilities,  
engineering systems, approach to control of legionella, etc., equip-  
ment schedules and choice of finishes and fittings.  
One impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will be a greater  
emphasis on building infection prevention into the SoA and the  
hospital organisation diagram. This may include increases to cer-  
tain space allowances to enable social distancing, additional hand  
# Hospitals 20-31  
washing facilities to support enhanced hygiene measures. It may  
also involve the segregation of the hospital into semi-autonomous  
zones for patients with a known or suspected pandemic infection  
\(referred to as ‘blue pathways’\) and for patients who have tested  
negative for the infection \(referred to as ‘green pathways’\).  
At a detailed level of design, the specification of interior prod-  
ucts and the design of interior details requires that ease of cleaning  
and disinfection be kept constantly in mind.  
Traditional methods of disinfection often use solutions of  
chlorine in water; more modern systems include ‘fogging’ with  
disinfecting vapour. Both traditional and modern methods of dis-  
infection require prior cleaning of surfaces to physically remove  
contaminants. ‘Fogging’ requires rooms/areas to be sealed during  
the process. Materials used need to be resilient to cleaning and  
disinfection methods used. Commonly, coved skirtings and sealed  
light fittings will be used in clinical areas.  
Although a range of antimicrobial-impregnated products \(such  
as surface coatings, paints and curtains\) is available, there is, at  
the time of writing, no definitive data to support their efficacy in  
reducing HCAIs.  
# 10.2 Materials  
Specification of materials for the interior of a hospital need to  
reflect a balance between factors such as robustness, frequency and  
cost of maintenance, sustainability and infection control.  
While the infection control agenda tends towards the selection  
of hard, smooth surfaces and products with few or sealed joints,  
this needs to be balanced with therapeutic, other safety, and main-  
tenance considerations including\:  
• Acoustics – hard, smooth surfaces can reduce speech intel-  
ligibility increasing the risk of clinical error, difficulty in  
communication between clinicians and patients, lack of privacy,  
stress, lack of sleep, disorientation for dementia sufferers.  
• Heating and ventilation – the choice will need to consider energy  
efficiency, type of facility, local conditions, appropriate patient/  
user control.  
• Artificial lighting design – needs to go beyond consideration  
of light levels and uniformity required for clinical procedures  
to include requirements for therapeutic environment including  
variety and control. Luminaires should be selected with energy  
efficiency, frequency and cost of lamp replacement in mind.  
• Safety – smoother floors are generally easier to clean but are  
more slippery, so careful risk assessment is needed to select  
appropriate material for different areas.  
• Maintenance – adequate access to mechanical and electrical  
services for maintenance and repair needs to be considered  
alongside the infection control agenda for smooth, sealed sur-  
faces.  
# 10.3 Engineering services  
Building services engineering refers here to mechanical, electrical  
and public health engineering \(MEP\) and includes general and spe-  
cialist installations such as medical gases and nurse call systems  
and, when necessary, the storage and disposal of radioactively con-  
taminated waste.  
The adequate provision of the building services strategy in a  
healthcare building depends on many factors that underline the  
importance of developing its approach as early as possible in paral-  
lel with the building design.  
Hospital buildings are highly serviced facilities, and the engi-  
neering services account for 40–50 per cent of a healthcare project’s  
construction budget. The scale of the services required has a sig-  
nificant impact on the final volume of the healthcare building, of  
which 5 per cent of total building area is used for vertical services  
distribution risers, while plant rooms comprise a total building area **20-32 Hospitals**  
of 10–15 per cent, and ceiling voids are commonly provided with  
1 m depth or more to allow for the services distribution.  
The variation in type and size of healthcare buildings, the  
increasing complexity of healthcare treatments, the reduction in  
energy consumption, and the provision of consumerism \(patient  
and relative comfort and convenience\) are only a few issues to be  
tackled when defining the building services strategy requirements.  
HTMs provide advice and guidance on the design and opera-  
tion of a variety of engineering matters in healthcare premises such  
as requirements for air quality and ventilation to operating depart-  
ments, intensive treatment units and isolation suites including  
negative pressurised rooms, and the control of air pressure, clean-  
liness and humidity. In addition, HTMs also detail requirements  
for temperature control where, for example, internal temperatures  
in patient areas do not exceed 28°C for more than 50 hours per  
year during the summertime, and for water quality control on the  
prevention of infection, for example, legionella and pseudomonas.  
Integration of services and building design is a key success factor  
for the project to achieve a high level of occupant comfort and building  
performance. This requires time-consuming coordination and gener-  
ally involves the development of a 3D-coordinated model in BIM.  
Passive measures such as massing, orientation and fabric of  
the building should be the focus of building design to create com-  
fortable environmental conditions inside a building. However, the  
balance of such passive measures with active systems \(boilers and  
chillers, mechanical ventilation, electric lighting and so on\) has to  
be considered for the achievement of energy efficiency. Many hos-  
pitals contain much heat generating equipment, deep plans, specific  
performance in terms of temperature and humidity control and are  
continuously occupied. This creates quite a challenge.  
As with other aspects of hospital design, the response to the  
Covid-19 pandemic will also have implications for the design of the  
services infrastructure. In particular, the infection risk associated  
with Aerosol Generating Procedures \(AGPs\) has been highlighted  
as being of particular significance. Addressing this risk in existing  
facilities may entail physically enclosing zones within previously  
open-plan treatment areas, and upgrading mechanical ventilation to  
provide a higher number of air changes per hour.  
# 10.4 Sustainability  
The basic objective of sustainability is to minimise the negative  
environmental impact of development, through the reduction of the  
consumption of non-renewable resources and production of waste,  
for the creation of a healthy environment.  
The government is committed to the three facets of sustaina-  
ble development \(environmental, social and economic\), meaning  
that decisions should consider the needs of individuals, maximise  
well-being and protect the environment, including the reduction  
of energy consumption, waste, water usage and carbon emissions.  
The commitment of the NHS to sustainable development is pre-  
sented in the document entitled Sustainable Development Strategy  
for the Health and Social Care System 2014–2020. In 2020 these  
goals were reinforced by a commitment to achieve net zero carbon  
by 2040 for emissions it controls directly and by 2045 for emis-  
sions it can influence.  
BREEAM \(Building Research Establishment Environmental  
Assessment Method\) and LEED \(Leadership in Energy and  
Environmental Design\) are widely used environmental assessment  
methods. BREEAM Health has been specifically developed, taking  
into account issues particular to this building type \(it has super-  
seded NEAT, which was the NHS’s own system\).  
# 11 SAFETY  
# 11.1 Fire safety  
Healthcare buildings must comply with requirements for fire safety  
and means of escape. Key regulations are\:  
• Approved Document Part B of Schedule 1 \(Vol 2\) of Building  
Regulations – provides guidance on compliance with fire safety  
requirements for some of the core common building types \(see  
also Chapter 11, Fire safety\).  
• Firecode – fire safety in the NHS HTM 05–01, HTM 05–02 and  
HTM 05–03. These have been prepared by the Department of  
Health to provide specific guidance for healthcare premises.  
Hospital emergency evacuation strategies are based on the  
concept of Progressive Horizontal Evacuation \(PHE\) whereby  
patients are moved to adjoining areas within the building. The  
Firecode HTM05–02 defines the principle of PHE as ‘moving  
occupants from an area affected by fire through a fire-resisting  
barrier to an adjoining area on the same level, designed to protect  
the occupants from the immediate dangers of fire and smoke \(a  
refuge\)’.  
Depending on the mobility of the patients \(Firecode has  
three classifications for patient dependency\), PHE is usually  
undertaken utilising beds or wheelchairs. In some situations,  
depending on the location of the fire, vertical evacuation is the  
only option. Nevertheless, the decision to move patients is not  
taken lightly, as any movement can potentially aggravate the  
patient’s condition.  
The HTM 05–02 is a very comprehensive document that covers  
all major principles of fire safety in healthcare buildings. It pro-  
vides guidance to means of warning and escape. Its three main  
requirements are explained next.  
*Compartmentation*  
Compartmentation of a large building into areas \(compartments\)  
of limited size, divided by fire-resisting partitions, allows escape  
away from the fire source into a nearby place of relative safety in  
the initial stages of the fire. Compartments containing patient-ac-  
cess areas should be divided into smaller sub-compartments to  
limit the number of patients who may be affected by a fire.  
*Hospital street*  
The hospital street, a primary circulation route between areas of the  
hospital, can form a major fire-fighting platform. It also provides  
an alternative to an adjacent department for the purposes of PHE.  
Hospital streets have particular requirements of maximum travel  
distances defined within the Firecode.  
*Travel distances and escape routes*  
There is a limitation on maximum travel distance within a compart-  
ment and sub-compartment. Within a compartment, the maximum  
distance is 60 m; within a sub-compartment this is 30 m.  
Furthermore, the HTM also provides guidance on items such  
as fire detection and alarm, vertical escape, assisted patient evac-  
uation, final exits, external escape routes, departments providing  
specialised care, and about internal fire spread for linings and  
structure, external fire spread and access and facilities for the fire  
service.  
Fire engineering, which provides recommendations and guid-  
ance on the application of fire safety engineering principles, is  
recognised as an acceptable alternative method of compliance with  
the Approved Document B. It is covered by the British Standard  
7974\:2001 Application of fire safety engineering principles to the  
design of buildings, code of practice. This approach provides an  
opportunity for innovative design, where it is possible to reconcile  
the qualitative design aspirations of the healthcare building project  
\(e.g. the provision of public stairs, atria\) with the fire strategy and  
regulations.  
The design of the fire safety strategy for a healthcare building  
is not an end in itself. It ties in with lifelong client commitment to  
assess, manage and implement. In short, anyone who has control  
to any extent of over the healthcare premises will have responsi-  
bilities for ensuring that those using or occupying the premises are safe from harm caused by fire. The duties include carrying out a fire  
safety risk assessment of the premises, identifying safety measures  
and implementing them.  
# 11.2 Health and safety  
There are two major types of hazard in any type of healthcare envi-  
ronment due to the type of activity and the nature of the building  
occupants.  
*Slips, trips and falls*  
The need to prevent slips, trips and falls is essential as many  
building users are frail and/or elderly. Many factors can cause  
them, including flooring type, lighting levels and lack of contrast  
between floors, walls and doors. The most effective approach is  
therefore to ensure that slips and trips hazards are designed out of  
a building. For example, floors should be slip resistant for wet or  
dry conditions and be clear of obstacles; level changes should be  
clearly identified, and rooms should be large enough to provide  
for the required activities without clutter. Nevertheless, any pro-  
posed measures must be evaluated to avoid potential conflict with  
infection control.  
*Manual handling*  
The hospital can be a very physical work environment, including  
having to lift and move patients \(some of whom can be very large\)  
and also equipment, laundry, catering, supplies or waste. Poor  
practice can cause accidents, musculoskeletal disorders that can  
lead to inability to work, and discomfort and lack of dignity for the  
patient being moved. However, there is an opportunity to build in  
equipment to protect staff from harm and enhance patient privacy  
and dignity. For instance, the use of mobile or ceiling-mounted  
hoists to assist the staff to raise fallen individuals from the floor, to  
transfer patients from one place to another, and to handle bariatric  
\(plus size\) patients.  
Key safety regulations relating to healthcare premises and  
equipment include\:  
• Health and Safety at Work Act \(HSWA\) 1974. This Act of  
Parliament is the main piece of UK health and safety legislation.  
It requires employers to ensure, as far as is reasonably practica-  
ble, the health, safety and welfare at work of all their employees.  
• The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations  
1999\. This places a duty on employers to assess and manage  
risks to their employees and non-employees arising from work  
activities.  
• Workplace \(Health, Safety and Welfare\) Regulations 1992.  
These regulations are concerned with the working environment.  
They place a duty on employers to make sure that the workplace  
is safe and suitable for the tasks being carried out there, and that  
it does not present risks to employees and others.  
• The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 \(MHOR\)  
\(as amended in 2002\). These regulations are designed to protect  
and safeguard people in the workplace in situations that involve  
manual handling tasks.  
• The Construction Design and Management Regulations \(CDM  
2015\). The regulations set out what people involved in con-  
struction work need to do to protect themselves from harm and  
anyone the work affects. The aim is to create awareness of the  
importance of health and safety integration right through the  
beginning of the design and the construction process.  
# Hospitals 20-33  
into account not only the healthcare facility but also the surround-  
ing external areas, such as the car park.  
Access controls to doors are widely used throughout the health-  
care facilities in the ingress/egress of staff/patients/visitors to  
sensitive areas to and within the building, and for specific func-  
tions, for example the storage of drugs. However, any requirements  
to secure doors should be discussed with the fire officer to address  
any fire-related matter.  
Access-control requirements will vary pending on their location  
and function, and a variety of security systems can be implemented,  
such as a combination of proximity cards, press-to-release switches  
and entry phone/intercom systems linked to reception desks or staff  
bases.  
The use of personal protection devices \(tagging\) for babies and  
young children is one solution to address the safety concerns by  
protecting the child from unauthorised removal from the healthcare  
premises. Another option is the use of CCTV in non-private areas,  
for example in circulation corridors leading to the entrance/exit  
points of the Paediatric department.  
Panic alarm buttons should be provided in areas where a mem-  
ber of staff is likely to be alone with a member of the public.  
# 12 OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT  
# 12.1 Logistics  
Operational logistics is a useful instrument to increase efficiency  
and quality, and decrease cost in operational functions such as  
material flows in healthcare facilities. The use of automation,  
health information technology with bar coding technology, phar-  
maceutical robots and lean storage solutions can all assist with  
creating efficient support services.  
*Robotic systems*  
Known variously as Automated Guided Vehicles \(AGVs\), Self-  
Guided Vehicles \(SGV\), Laser-Guided Vehicles \(LGV\) or  
Automated Guided Carts/Trolleys – robotic systems are increas-  
ingly used as a material-handling solution in hospitals. Their usage  
allows the automatic pick-up and delivery from central processing  
areas such as the kitchen, laundry, waste, sterile and drugs stores  
to the patient floors. The AGV system has the potential to increase  
efficiency, reduce operating costs and potentially improve the  
patient experience.  
*Health Information Technology \(Health IT\)*  
Health IT is a broad concept that encompasses an array of tech-  
nologies \(e.g. electronic medical records, bar coding\) to store,  
share and analyse health information to improve patient care  
and safety. For example, the use of standards-based bar coding  
technology can provide improvements in material management  
coordination, in patient safety, clinical care delivery, patient  
tracking, patient registration and admission processes in the  
healthcare environment.  
*Lean storage*  
Use of a lean storage system is designed to eliminate waste through  
automating processes that improve productivity, inventory man-  
agement and space utilisation.  
# 11.3 Security  
Maintaining the safety and security of staff, patients, visitors and  
the NHS assets \(equipment and consumables\) is a crucial part of  
the service provided by the health bodies. A risk assessment is  
required to identify the security risks, and to identify measures that  
can be applied to reduce them. The safety procedures should take  
# 12.2 Facilities Management \(FM\)  
FM is a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to  
ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating peo-  
ple, places, process and technology. FM includes the integration  
of the planning and management of a wide range of services  
both hard \(e.g. building fabric\) and soft \(e.g. catering, cleaning,  
security, mail, porterage, waste management\) to achieve quality  
economically. **20-34 Hospitals**  
# 12.3 Whole Life Cycle Costing \(WLC\)  
WLC assesses the cost of an asset \(e.g. a healthcare facility\) over  
its lifetime. It takes into consideration initial capital costs, finance  
costs, operational costs, maintenance costs and replacement or dis-  
posal costs at the end of its life. Therefore, the whole life costs  
consider a healthcare facility project from inception through to  
design and construction, operation and finally re-use or disposal.  
It enables investment options in healthcare estates or buildings  
to be evaluated more effectively by considering the impact of all  
costs rather than only the initial capital costs.  
WLCs are substantially greater than capital or costs of initial  
construction, and so a small improvement in design organisation  
or specification could save a huge amount of revenue over the life  
of the facility. **21 Hotels**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 The hotel industry  
Hotels serve the needs of travellers, tourists, business visitors and oth-  
ers seeking temporary accommodation and other services. Essential  
requirements are clean, quiet and comfortable bedrooms together with  
good services that usually include meals. Ancillary facilities for busi-  
ness users and/or leisure attractions often influence choice although  
the costs involved and value for money are primary considerations.  
Prior to the design stage, many of the key requirements will have  
already been decided such as the location, number and types of rooms  
and the extent of facilities to be provided. Preliminary estimates of  
costs and revenues form part of the feasibility analysis for the invest-  
ment. Design briefs are normally provided by developers, including  
hotel companies who may be involved in managing the property.  
The trend is towards multiple chain operating groups special-  
ising in hotel management. These offer a wide range of services  
including professionally trained staff, established confidence in the  
standards provided and the advantages of scale in their advertising  
and reservation systems. Chain hotels may be company owned but  
are frequently financed by separate investors and then operated by  
the hotel company under contract or through a franchise.  
Hotels are seen as a business investment rather than property  
investment. The specific design requirements generally make  
future conversion to other uses difficult and expensive. High-grade  
hotels typically offer a choice of suites as well as standard rooms  
and often extend their hotel services to apartments in associated  
developments such as in condominiums. Aparthotels are designed  
with apartments, instead of individual bedrooms.  
# 1.2 Hotel classification  
Standards of services and facilities in hotels vary widely from  
luxury to basic. Hotel groups distinguish the types of hotels they  
operate by branding with specific names and design features.  
Tourism authorities in most countries use symbols \(stars, crowns,  
etc.\) to classify hotels and other types of tourist accommodation.  
Some commercial agencies and travel publications also grade their  
members by prices and services offered.  
Hotels are primarily categorised by their location \(e.g. city, sub-  
urban, resort, country, airport, motel\) and also by the main markets  
they serve \(e.g. business travellers, convention groups, holiday  
seekers, motorists\). Typical categories cover\:  
• 5\* Luxury\: exclusive named hotels in exotic destinations and  
prime city locations  
• 4\* High class\: with extensive facilities for business users and  
high spend tourists  
• 3\* Mid-grade\: full service traditional hotels, independent or  
company managed  
• 2\* Budget\: standard branded designs with some services for  
motorists and tourists  
• 1\* Basic\: economy brands designed with minimal space and lim-  
ited facilities.  
Grading also takes account of the extent of services offered.  
Staff requirements in a full service hotel are substantial with pay-  
roll absorbing up to one-third of the turnover. Designs must ensure  
maximum working efficiency and provide adequate employee facil-  
ities including controlled entry, separate changing rooms, lockers,  
toilets, restroom, canteen, security, personnel offices and – often –  
some living accommodation. Ratios of employees to guestrooms  
range from 0.2–0.3 budget, 0.5–0.6 mid-grade, 0.8–1.0 high-grade,  
to 1.5 luxury standard.  
Demands for value and convenience have led to increases in  
standardised chains’ budget hotels \(e.g. motels, inns\) sited with  
highway service stations or around towns and near attractions.  
Some brands are designed to provide basic facilities operated with  
a minimum of staff.  
# 1.3 Other tourist accommodation  
Internet tourism services provide choice from a wide range of alter-  
natives including domestic properties \(e.g. B&B, guest houses\),  
traditional inns and vacation use of university and college accom-  
modation. Tourists, particularly families, increasingly choose  
self-catering facilities in new or converted properties and resort  
areas with alternative choice of eating places nearby.  
Resort complexes are developed as self-contained tourist des-  
tinations complete with extensive leisure facilities and supporting  
services on site. Most are designed as seaside, marina, ski, spa, golf  
or forest-based holiday village resorts. Tourist resorts may be operated  
by a commercial company, or co-ownership management. In the latter,  
accommodation is based on apartments, lodges and other properties  
for sale on individual, time-share or condominium arrangements.  
# 2 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
# 2.1 Sites and surroundings  
The location and site largely dictate the design and relationship of  
the different parts of a hotel\:  
• Resorts – views of the attractions \(e.g. sea, lake, park, spec-  
tacular scenery\) provide marketing and higher value revenue  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-24 **21-1** **21-2 Hotels**  
benefits. This should be maximised for guestrooms and public  
areas such as restaurants. Interesting site activities \(e.g. marina,  
golf course, swimming pool\) and exotic landscaping also influ-  
ence the layout.  
• City centre developments – these are determined mainly by site  
constraints and planning considerations. High site costs may lead  
to high value frontages being used for shops and malls; pent-  
house floors as luxury serviced apartments or suites. Invariably,  
development costs are increased by the need for underground  
parking and basement services, including goods entry and dock-  
ing. Multiple floors of guestrooms require extensive guest and  
service lifts as well as complex technical systems. The need for  
ancillary facilities such as convention/function halls can occupy  
a large part of the site area.  
• Key city sites – these allow for high-rise statement buildings  
which, themselves, attract attention. They may be designed  
entirely as a hotel or for multiple users with specific floors allo-  
cated for hotel accommodation and services. The latter requires  
more complex separate arrangements for guest reception and  
transportation as well as for goods services. Tower buildings  
require large structural core areas housing vertical services  
\(lifts, stairs, ducts, service rooms, etc.\) and the ratio of perimeter  
rooms per floor area is limited.  
• Suburban sites – here site and construction costs are lower and  
allow greater flexibility in site layout and building design. There  
are savings in foundation and structural costs, technical services  
are often simplified and lift systems may be rationalised. These  
include hotels sited within or near airports on the outskirts of  
towns, or in locations which attract a mixed market of tourists,  
local functions and business travellers.  
• Roadside and stopover places – these cater for motorists and other  
travellers and are invariably chain operated budget designs, with  
standardised rooms and minimal facilities for meals. Typical  
buildings are modular with prefabricated technical services, one  
or two storeys in height. Optimum sites are associated with other  
motorway services along highways, at main junctions and near  
attractions along tourist routes.  
**21.1** *Circulation and relationship diagram*  
# 2.2 Access and site development  
In the preliminary design stage, consideration must be given to\:  
• Restrictions, including planning, property rights and other legal  
limitations, which may limit plot ratio and height of building.  
• Access routes to separate guests from goods delivery/services  
and employee entries.  
• Site planning for parking requirements and potential future  
extensions.  
• The main entrance must be prominent, appropriate for the style  
and grade of hotel. In urban hotels, secondary access from the  
car park must lead directly to the reception lobby. A separate  
entrance and reception may be required for large convention/  
function groups.  
Car parking space depends on the location, patterns of use,  
transport modes and availability of public parking/taxi services.  
Motor and airport hotels typically provide 1.1 spaces/room, city  
centre hotels about 0.3 spaces/room plus 0.2 spaces/convention  
or function seat. Resort hotels may require only 0.2 spaces/room  
plus coach parking. Provisions must also be made for separate staff  
parking.  
# 2.3 Spatial and functional relationships  
The functional requirements of a full service hotel can be grouped  
into three distinct but linked areas\: public, guest room and back of  
house/administrative \(Figure 21.1\).  
# 2.4 Public areas  
For guests and usually open to non-residents, public rooms include  
lounges, restaurants, bars, meeting rooms, ballrooms and other  
rooms catering for functions. Other facilities, such as fitness rooms,  
spas and leisure pools, may also allow for local club membership.  
Typical requirements include\:  
• Large span spacious areas to accommodate planned numbers of  
users and allow changes in layout and design to suit different  
requirements.  
• Situated at or near ground floor level to allow easy access, con-  
trol and emergency exit.  
• External views required for restaurants. Speciality restaurants  
and bars may be sited at rooftop level in tall buildings with  
dedicated lift access and services. In lobbies and convention/  
function halls, an impressive, spacious interior design is impor-  
tant. Natural light is an advantage in lounges and break-out  
foyers.  
• Support areas \(e.g. foyers, equipment stores, food service facili-  
ties, staff access\) must be sited adjacent or easily accessible with  
effective screening to avoid disturbance in use.  
# 2.5 Guestrooms  
Bedrooms and suites for resident guests are located to benefit from views  
and designed to minimise noise and disturbance. Residential accom-  
modation is the largest generator of net revenue and typically occupies  
some 70–75 per cent of the built area in full service hotels, see Table I. **Table I Residential area ratios**

• Careful planning of stairs, lifts and corridors to facilitate easy  
circulation and access for guests

# Hotels 21-3  
• Guest circulations via the main reception area while staff have  
direct access from back of house areas \(e.g. housekeeping, laun-  
dry, kitchens, maintenance, stores\)  
• Specific requirements apply for disabled access, fire escapes,  
security, safety and noise reduction.  
# 2.6 Back of house and administration areas  
These accommodate the technical and operational installations  
including staff facilities and workrooms. They are located in the  
least valuable areas with vehicle access for goods delivery and  
waste/recycling removal, maintenance and emergency services.  
Facilities include\:  
• Basements in large hotels and high value sites. Lift motor hous-  
ing and ventilation/air-conditioning plant sited in screened  
rooftop locations  
• Separate areas for loading docks, waste containment, control,  
storage rooms, engineering, housekeeping, laundries, employees  
and main food storage and production  
• Internal service access \(separate from guest areas\) to guestrooms,  
and from service areas to public rooms \(restaurants, bars, func-  
tion rooms, furniture/equipment stores\)  
• Separate facilities for hotel administration are required. Offices  
for duty management are located near the reception lobby with  
access to the reception desk.  
# 2.7 Circulation and signage  
Routes to be taken by guests, non-residents and staff must be  
carefully planned to facilitate easy movement and control \(Figure  
21.2a–c\). This also indicates the optimum locations for support  
facilities and the services required. All routes must be kept clear of  
obstruction and be wide enough to avoid congestion, particularly  
in areas where people congregate \(e.g. reception desk, foyers, lift

lobbies, luggage handling, service areas\). Signs are required for  
directions and information, including evacuation routes. Graphic  
design must be an integral part of interior design and be co-ordi-  
nated throughout. Approved symbols must be used and all signs  
must be sited within normal viewing patterns.  
# 2.8 Corridors and staircases  
Corridors, stairs, ducts and room service lobbies add to net room  
areas, increasing the built areas and costs. Circulation in public  
spaces should, wherever possible, be through areas of other use  
such as the lobby, lounges or shopping malls.  
In residential floors, economic considerations \(gross factors,  
corridor lengths\) generally require bedrooms to be sited on both  
sides of the corridor. Typical gross factors are central ‘double  
loaded’ corridors 20–30 per cent, and ‘single loaded’ corridors and  
tower buildings up to 35–45 per cent.  
Corridor and staircase design is dictated by fire regulations and  
codes. The main stairs should be prominently located beside the lift  
bank to allow easy alternative use and evacuation.  
Secondary stairs must be provided at or near the end of each  
corridor and within the maximum travel distances allowed.  
For corridors with sprinkler systems allowing two alternative  
means of escape, this distance is usually 60 m although 90 m may  
be permitted. For one route of escape \(suites and rooms beyond  
the end staircase\) this is reduced to 9 m. Automatic self-closure  
smoke doors must be provided midway along the corridor. All exits  
must be clearly indicated, protected by smoke doors or ventilation  
control, meet fire resistance standards and lead to safe evacuation  
areas. \(See Section 2.16 Fire safety.\)  
# 2.9 Lifts  
Lift installations are generally required for guestroom floors above  
the second storey. The lift entry for guests must be visible from the  
reception desk and monitored by cameras on each floor. Guest lifts  
must be set back from corridors, have wide opening doors for easy  
access, good lighting and ventilation and have durable surfaces to  
resist damage by baggage. Floor levelling at landings is important.  
Lift shafts must meet requirements for structural stability, fire  
resistance of shafts and doors, smoke venting and control. Machine  
rooms housing motors, pulleys, controls and hoisting beam are  
normally located above the shaft. All lifts must have safety mech-  
anisms and efficient control systems, including emergency power,  
lighting and lifting gear together with fire over-ride controls with  
return to lobby or exit floor.  
Performance requirements for large high-grade hotels\:  
• Carrying capacities – maximum number of passengers to be  
carried at peak times based on business pattern, and guestroom  
population  
• Waiting times – depend on round trip time and numbers of lifts  
installed but a good service for high standard hotels is around  
25–30 seconds in peak use  
• Inter-connected collective controls – advanced signalling on  
landings are necessary in tall hotel buildings. In large hotels,  
banks of lifts are grouped in facing rows of no more than four  
with adequate space for assembly \(3.5 m wide for guestroom  
lifts\)  
• Specialist installations – include basement car park lifts with fire  
safety provisions, direct lifts to leisure facilities and transparent  
lifts in atriums. High-rise buildings may require fire protected  
enclosures with separate power supply and controls for fire-fight-  
ing access.  
# 2.10 Service lifts  
• Separate provision of service lifts is needed for housekeeping  
and room services.  
• Typically in the ratio of 1\:2, 2\:3 or 3\:4 guest lifts depending on  
standards.  
• Lifts open on to service lobbies and pantries on each floor and  
are commonly grouped back to back with the guest lift shaft.  
• Service lifts extend down to the back of house areas and are  
designed for practical use transporting staff, trolleys, supplies  
and equipment.  
• At least one must be large enough to take furniture such as a bed  
or, in emergency, a stretcher requiring direct transfer to ambu-  
lance.  
• Large hotels may require a heavy duty lift for goods/equipment  
transfer from loading docks, including convention exhibits.  
# 2.11 Environment  
The internal environment must be attractive, engender confidence  
in the operation and leave a favourable impression. Each area will  
need to meet specified needs of space and facilities to achieve the  
design objectives within its allocated budget. In general, interiors  
and fittings must be safe, resist damage and be easy to repair or  
replace. Domestic furniture and furnishings are usually not suitable  
or sufficiently robust for hotel use.  
# 2.12 Lighting  
Lighting should assist in providing an appropriate environment,  
differentiate spaces and illuminate signs and hazards.  
• Light sources and controls are selected to serve particular  
requirements ranging from external flood lighting to highlight-  
ing interior features and work areas such as reception desks,  
service counters and bars.  
• Energy conservation in lighting, air-conditioning and power  
consumption is important in controlling utility costs. Provisions  
include zoned area regulation, guestroom electricity control with  
entry card, central energy recovery and recycling.  
• Hotels must ensure that there is adequate provision of emergency  
lighting for safety and basic essential services. In high-grade  
hotels, installed generators have capacity to meet all require-  
ments. Automatic switchover is required.  
# 2.13 Noise control  
Hotels may necessarily be located in areas of high ambient noise  
such as highway and street traffic, airports and urban surroundings.  
Many hotel activities and equipment also generate noise externally  
\(e.g. car parks, loading docks, generators and rooftop plant\).  
Internal work areas, plant rooms and other noise generating  
environments are largely grouped together in the back of house  
areas which can be separated or insulated from those used by resi-  
dents and visitors.  
Adequate standards of insulation are essential for rooms sensi-  
tive to noise intrusion particularly for the residential guestrooms at  
night. Sound insulation performance criteria for maximum ambi-  
ent noise levels in rooms are usually based on Noise Rating \(NR\)  
curves covering a range of frequencies, for example\:  
• Guest bedrooms\: NR25 broadly an ambient level of 30–35  
decibels  
• Conference halls\: NR25 with acoustic design to limit reverber-  
ation for clarity  
• Smaller meeting rooms\: NR30 including partitioned areas  
• Restaurants\: NR50 with noise/light screening from kitchens.  
Construction of bedroom blocks is usually based on floor  
slabs with structural cross-walls which also provide a large mass  
and high density for good sound insulation and fire resistance.  
Acoustic treatment of flanking paths \(e.g. bathroom ducts, ceiling  
voids, interconnecting doors\) is necessary. Double glazing is usu-  
ally required in busy urban areas with increased width/insulated  
spacing facing noisy highways. Insulation performance of various  
construction elements are expressed as Sound Transmission Class  
\(STC\) Ratings. Provision must also be made for reduction of noise transmission  
through air-conditioning, plumbing and other installed systems as  
well as impact noise from lift movements. Measures include con-  
finement of machine generated noise, reduction of vibration, design  
of distribution networks and sealing of ducts and voids.  
Disturbance in bedrooms may also arise from internal sources.  
The design must minimise impact noise with resilient/absorbent  
floor covering \(carpets\) as well as quiet door closures, locking sys-  
tems and moveable fittings. In adjacent rooms, noise generating  
areas such as bathrooms are grouped back to back and similar con-  
siderations determine the layout for quiet zones.  
Public areas involve other considerations. Ballrooms and  
convention halls cater for large assemblies of visitors and alterna-  
tive uses ranging from noise sensitive conferences and functions  
\(speeches\) to noisy entertainment. Noise control measures involve  
the location of public rooms away from residential areas and pro-  
vision of foyers and service pantries as intermediary areas together  
with insulation requirements for the sensitive areas.  
# 2.14 Safety  
Providing accommodation for transient travellers and tourists who  
are unfamiliar with the layout and equipment, hotels need to have  
particular regard to their safety and security. Safety for employees  
and their work areas must also be considered.  
Requirements are governed by statutory legislation, insurance  
conditions, hotel grading and operating standards. Safety features  
in all aspects of planning, design, operation and maintenance and  
the provisions for fire egress have a major influence on the arrange-  
ment of rooms and circulations.  
# 2.15 Design checklists  
For details of general requirements, see Chapter 3 People and  
movement and Chapter 11 Fire safety. Hotel design requires par-  
ticular attention to the following.  
Guest and visitor areas\:  
• Circulation\: changes in floor level, positioning of signs, space  
for assembly  
• Stairs\: maximum 16 steps between landings and minimum three,  
non-slip with distinct edges, appropriate handrails  
• Door swings\: landing areas, viewing panels, visibility of glass doors  
• Windows\: glass specifications, method of cleaning, risk of acciden-  
tal opening \(locking/sealing\), vertigo \(sill height below 1120 mm\)  
• Balconies\: safety/entry risks, structural stability, wind turbu-  
lence, drainage.  
Service and work areas\:  
• Space\: for work, equipment use, circulation  
• Ergonomics\: \(dimensions, shelf heights\)  
• Equipment protection\: machinery, hot surfaces, flames \(fire con-  
trol\), electrical safety  
• Environment\: lighting \(levels, shadowing\), ventilation \(temper-  
atures, humidity, fumes\)  
• Fire\: high-risk areas, fire control, evacuation  
• First aid\: locations, treatment facilities  
• Maintenance\: requirements, accessibility, drainage.  
# 2.16 Fire safety  
Protection and means of escape in event of fire imposes specific  
requirements in hotels. This is due to the large numbers of people  
who are sleeping in separate rooms, and are unfamiliar with the  
building and warning systems and need to be alerted and evacu-  
ated. Also, many guests may be elderly or very young, disabled,  
tired or inebriated. There may be large numbers of visitors attend-  
ing functions or conventions, creating crowd control problems. In  
addition, staff are on duty intermittently, in different departments  
with few at night.  
# Hotels 21-5  
Requirements are\:  
• Fire loadings are high due to furnishings. Many areas present high  
fire risks \(e.g. kitchens, stores, workshops, basement car parks\).  
• Minimum fire resistance periods for escape stairs are normally  
1 hour, increasing to 2 hours for heights over 30 m. Basements  
require special provisions. Combustible material and surface  
flame spread ratings are controlled in escape routes.  
• Sprinkler systems with fire mode ventilation switching, and  
alarm, smoke door and lift activation are commonly used in large  
hotels. Fire alarm, indication panel and hydrant systems must  
be installed together with portable and CO2 extinguishers \(for  
electrical equipment\) in specific areas.  
• Access for fire fighting vehicles, appliances, ambulances and  
other emergency services  
• Tall buildings may require the provision of a fire fighting lift with  
independent power, external access and protected enclosure.  
\(See Chapter 11 Fire safety for details.\)  
# 2.17 Security  
Security is an important consideration for guests in unfamiliar sur-  
roundings, for confidential meetings and large group events as well  
as for control of loss and damage of hotel property. In operational  
terms, security in hotels must be effective without becoming obtru-  
sive or unduly restrictive.  
By the nature of their business, hotels involve high investment  
costs in property and furnishings. They must be open to a wide  
spectrum of transient residents and visitors, many bringing val-  
uable items. A high ratio of hotel employees are temporary with  
a high turnover rate and many services are contracted out. Theft,  
deliberate damage and vandalism are not uncommon.  
Security measures include\:  
• Prevention of theft\: construction \(doors, walls, windows, access  
points\), CCTV monitoring and sensor indicator systems, control  
of entry/exit through fire escape and service doors, surveillance  
of car parks, grounds, all hotel entrances  
• Control of entry\: electronic card locking systems for residents and  
for staff \(with restricted area access and master control\). Staff and  
goods entrances through personnel and security controlled areas  
• Separation\: residential lifts and stairs in view of reception desk.  
Planned and monitored circulations for restaurants, meeting/  
function rooms and support areas, service circulations separated  
from those for guests  
• Baggage\: handling and checking controlled, baggage/lost prop-  
erty rooms isolated and have explosion relief  
• Administration\: location and design of security offices. Banks  
of monitor screens and recording equipment, lockable secure  
interview room, direct lines to police, fire, ambulance and other  
emergency services  
• Hotel management\: integrated computer systems of guest infor-  
mation, billing, accountancy, purchasing and stock records,  
employee and personnel details, maintenance, equipment and  
property records and contracts.  
# 2.18 Hygiene  
Hotels must maintain high hygiene standards to meet public health  
legislation and their reputation. This covers most areas, particularly  
design of food services, rubbish storage, water supplies, sanitation  
and air-conditioning including cooling towers.  
# 2.19 Communication systems and services  
The multiple functions involved in hotel operations call for highly  
sophisticated systems of telecommunications. Hotel management,  
finance, personnel, property operations, marketing, ordering and  
stock control, guest services and other requirements are increasingly  
computerised with automatic controls and customised software. **21-6 Hotels**  
The rapid changes in equipment, installed networks and ser-  
vices have many implications in planning hotel buildings as well as  
for interior design, for example\:  
• High speed, large capacity external telecommunication network  
connections, receivers and booster equipment where required  
• Automatic back up installations, including power generators and  
information storage  
• Changes in requirements and mode of operation affecting design  
of reception desks and other departmental services  
• Extensive installation of sensing, monitoring and automatic  
response integrated computer systems for control of building  
engineering services, security, fire safety and other networks  
• Provision of secure computer rooms with independent air-condi-  
tioning, work areas and associated equipment  
• Ensuring adequate access and space for maintenance and future  
changes in terminal equipment, cable conduits and ducts  
• Specialist design of cable networks including safe separation of  
different voltages, colour coding, access and detailed records.  
Design of computer installations depends on the size, sophis-  
tication and complexity of hotel services ranging from fully  
integrated computerised systems in large high standard hotels to  
interfaced standalone systems and Wi-Fi supporting the required  
number of terminals.  
# 2.20 Building engineering services  
Requirements for technical and engineering installations vary with loca-  
tion, size construction and sophistication of the hotel. Guestrooms call  
for service ducts, conduits and tunnels to enclose pipe work and cables  
connected to each room. Zoned distribution networks are required for  
lighting, power, central ventilation and air-conditioning systems.  
Site planning includes arrangements for foul and surface water  
drainage, utility connections and requirements such as transform-  
ers. Most engineering services plant is located in back of house  
areas including basements. Ventilation and air cooling plant and  
other machinery is often located at rooftop level. High-rise and  
complex buildings often require intermediary transfer/technical  
services floors. In all cases, space, access and facilities must be  
provided for maintenance as well as for future changes including  
additional requirements and replacement.  
# 3 GUESTROOMS AND SUITES  
# 3.1 Commercial criteria  
Guestrooms take up between 65 per cent \(luxury\) and 85 per cent  
\(budget\) of the total built area of a modern hotel. The income from  
rooms is invariably the largest source of hotel revenue and makes  
the greatest contribution to gross profits.  
Requirements for guestrooms are largely dictated by market  
analysis of the potential users including\:  
• Main markets\: demand for single, double, twin and family  
rooms. Work areas for business guests  
• Fluctuation\: weekend, seasonal, etc. changes. Furniture and  
equipment. Adaptability  
• Quality and grade\: standards of sophistication, size and room  
services. Suites  
• Lengths of stay\: size and layout of rooms, amount of furniture  
and storage space.  
Room dimensions are critical. A reduction or increase in room  
area is multiplied by the number of rooms involved. However,  
rooms which are too small are often visually restrictive or crowded,  
inflexible, difficult to service and liable to increase in damage.  
# 3.2 Standardisation  
There are a number of generic block-form hotel types ranging from  
linear to circular, Figure 21.3a–f.  
**21.3a–f** *Guest room floor plans*  
Note\: The configuration of guest room floors is largely determined by the site, orientation, support requirements of lower floors and lift arrangements. Slab construction is  
based on extended linear blocks which may be a\) single or double loaded, rectangular, or b\) curved, or c\) T configurations or extended as an atrium round public spaces. Tower  
configurations include d\) triangular, e\) rectangular, or f\) circular arrangements of rooms around a central structural core of lifts, stairs ducts and service rooms. **Hotels 21-7**  
**21.4** *Reduced dimensions for economy hotels*  
In multi-storey hotel buildings, repetitive modules from  
floor to floor are essential for structural design and location  
of service ducts. Hotel guest rooms are predominantly the  
same size and designed using similar furniture with options  
for internal arrangement. Standardisation of requirements is  
important for\:  
• Cost and time savings in construction, prefabrication  
• Uniform quality and pricing, particularly in brand design  
• Efficiency in organising routines in housekeeping services  
• Economy in bulk purchasing of equipment, furniture and  
furnishings  
• Rationalisation of maintenance work and replacements.  
# 3.3 Room dimensions  
Standard room widths are based on bed length of 2000 mm with  
wall furniture widths of 600 mm and circulation/activity space of  
1000 mm adding to 3.65 m. For economy, this can be reduced to  
3.5 m or increased to give a more spacious impression. Construction  
modules \(to wall centres\) add 200–230 mm.  
It is important to ensure the most efficient use of room dimen-  
sions. Increase in width reduces the number of rooms or increases  
the length of corridors adding to gross areas and costs. Structural  
modules are invariably based on pairs of rooms sharing a common  
services duct.  
Room lengths are generally more variable although these may  
be dictated by site or structural restrictions. Bathroom dimensions  
are dictated by the number and spacing of fitments.  
In general, rooms are designed for double occupancy, allowing  
flexibility in use. Net room areas vary with locations, land costs,  
standards and brand designs, Figures 21.4–21.9.

High-grade \(4\*\) 27–30 Business and high spend users  
Luxury \(5\*\) 34–36 Individual designs. Variable layouts  
Note\: Basic rooms adaptable for family use.  
# 3.4 Functional zones  
Room interiors are planned to provide zoned areas for vari-  
ous functions with adequate space for furniture, convenient use  
and cleaning. Zoning indicates optimum positions for controls,  
switches, lighting/power connections, fittings and other installa-  
tions required for planning engineering and technical services\:  
• Lounge/work\: near windows, views, daylight, moveable furniture  
• Sleeping\: quiet areas away from windows, beds screened from  
entrance  
• Bedside\: controls, lighting, telephone, easy access  
• Dressing\: good lighting, mirror, table, drawers, chair/stool, multiple use  
• Luggage\: convenient position/design, durable, damage protec-  
tion, secure safes  
• Storage\: near entrance, wardrobe/shelves, visible interiors, sup-  
plementary lighting  
• Circulation\: width \(luggage\), dual use of space.  
# 3.5 Variations in rooms  
To rationalise circulation, guest rooms in multi-storey hotels are  
invariably grouped in linear blocks arranged to meet site, structure  
and statutory – particularly fire escape – requirements.  
Housekeeping efficiency is also a consideration in grouping  
numbers of rooms.  
Variations in room sizes and suites are best located on the top  
floors, at junctions of blocks and in specifically designed areas.  
Most standard suites occupy two modules. Connecting double  
doors \(sound proofed, dual locks\) between adjacent guestrooms  
provide for occasional family and special needs.  
Balconies and terraces give rise to problems of safety, wind  
damage, drainage and security. They are normally limited to resort  
locations, Figures 21.10, 21.11.  
By their nature, aparthotel rooms require additional space,  
Figure 21.12.

# 3.6 Furniture and furnishings  
Room and bed occupancies \(bednights\) in hotels are perishable.  
They require high turnovers, intense use and efficient housekeep-  
ing to maximise revenues. Furniture, furnishings and interiors must  
be practical, robust and resistant to damage while meeting stand-  
ards expected by the guests, Figures 21.13, 21.14, 21.15.  
This calls for detailed specifications to meet quality and perfor-  
mance requirements.  
Particular considerations include\:  
• Surfaces\: resistant to breakage/damage by scraping, burns, stains  
and cosmetics, etc. Vulnerable areas protected \(dressing tables,  
luggage racks, walls, entrances\)  
• Support\: firm anchorage in walls for cantilevered furniture and fittings  
• Framework\: strong, rigid joints and construction. Ergonomic  
design standard units  
• Fittings\: durable design, simple, easy use, quiet movement  
• Floor covering\: carpets should be easy clean, durable, retain  
appearance and camouflage markings  
• Chairs, fabrics\: complementary to design scheme, fire retardant,  
curtain closure  
• Beds\: comfort, durability, retention of shape, edge reinforce-  
ment, quietness, standard dimensions, wall-fixed bedhead,  
cantilevered side cabinets, lamps  
• Bed linen, towels hard wearing, quality standards, duvet/blanket/  
pillow options/storage.

*double room is required*  
# 3.7 Bathroom location and design  
Bathrooms are invariably located internally, back to back, ena-  
bling adjacent rooms to be serviced through a shared duct. This  
requires mechanical ventilation \(in lowered ceiling void over the  
lobby\) but allows savings in pipework and drainage, maintenance  
access and efficient use of space and outside walls. Air extraction  
is automatically activated by the bathroom light switch \(outside  
the door\).  
Exceptionally, luxury bathrooms \(spa resorts\) or economy  
shower rooms may be on an external wall. Bathrooms sited between  
guestrooms increase corridor lengths, built areas and drainage but  
may be suitable in low-rise motels and building conversions.  
Bathroom dimensions are dictated by number and arrangement  
of fitments, particularly baths\:  
• Typical fitments\: 1500 mm bath, with grab bars, shower spray,  
retractable clothes line and curtain/screen; WC and washbasin.  
High-grade hotels use 1700 mm bath, twin basins set in vanitory  
surrounds, WC and bidet. Luxury units include separate dressing  
rooms and shower.  
• Requirements\: acoustic ceiling; non-slip, drained flooring;  
tiled walls; mirror over washbasin; screened moisture-proof  
lighting; electrical safety provisions; mixer valve; thermostatic  
control of hot water; warmed air inflow/extraction; electric  
shaver point, shelf space; towel racks; toilet paper holder; coat  
hanger; toiletry tray; tissue dispenser; lidded waste bin. High-  
grade hotels provide a telephone in the bathroom and music  
relay.  
# 3.8 Rooms for guests with disabilities  
As a rule, 1–2 per cent of guestrooms should be equipped for dis-  
abled use. Rooms for the ambulant disabled are generally on the  
ground floor for fire escape with easy access from the car park.  
Design requirements for access and room layouts must be con-  
sulted\:  
• Corridor width\: minimum of 915 mm with door openings  
815 mm minimum with wider lobbies  
• Bathrooms\: larger than standard with central turning space  
\(1.52 m\). Basin tops \(860 mm high\) with knee space. Toilet seat  
height \(430 mm\). Mirrors extended down. Grab bars fitted on  
head wall and sides of toilet and bath with easy access  
• Bedrooms\: standard 3.65 m wide rooms can be adapted \(with  
furniture changes\), e.g. lower switches \(1.2 m\), increased space  
between beds, knee space below dressing tables, low window  
cill height \(610 mm\) where practicable.  
# 4 PUBLIC AREAS  
# 4.1 Hotel entrance and reception lobby  
The main entrance and lobby must be prominent, spacious and  
appropriate to the style and grade of hotel. Design considerations\:  
• Mode of transport\: parking, taxis, vehicle turn round, drop off  
facility, shelter  
• Identification\: illumination, corporate styling, signage, assis-  
tance  
• Doorway\: type, mechanism, width, safety, fire exit, security,  
transitional temperature/draught control, disabled use  
• Services\: porter/luggage store.  
# 4.2 Lobbies  
The lobby is the hub of hotel operations and is important in creating  
the desired impression. It provides access to all the hotel facilities  
and about half the space is taken up by circulation.  
The trend is for lobbies to be social spaces with cafes,  
workstations, Wi-Fi, etc. and less dominated by the front desk,  
Figure 21.16.  
Lobby facilities include the front desk, lounge seating, retail  
space, toilets, cloakrooms, information/assistance and other ser-  
vices. Typical areas, based on the number of guestrooms, are  
0.3 m2/room – budget hotels, 0.5 m2/room – motor and airport  
hotels, 1.0 m2/room – resort and city centre hotels.  
The front desk is traditionally the main focus of activity and  
must be set back at least 1.25 m from circulation increasing to  
6 m or more for large convention hotels. Counters are typically  
designed with a convenient counter height for the guest and lower  
working height behind.  
Counter lengths are planned around 1.5–1.8 m wide designed  
workstations fitted with angled video display screens and key-  
boards. Functions such as registration, checkout and guest  
information are generally adaptable for open desk arrangement.  
Increasingly reservation services provide for automatic check-in  
and in room facilities can be used for check out payment reducing  
the peak demands on the desk. Desk lengths vary with size and  
grade of hotel e.g. 3 m – 50 rooms, 4.5 m – 100/150 rooms, 6.0 m –  
200/300 rooms. Some hotels use individual podium stations instead  
of a continuous counter.  
The desk has direct access to the front office including cashier  
and front office manager.  
Locations for other administration services \(security, telephone  
exchange and management offices\) are more flexible.  
In larger hotels, separate counters are usually provided for  
information \(concierge\), assistance and group reception. A sep-  
arate area for convention registration and assistance may be  
required. **Hotels 21-13**

# 4.3 Food and beverage services  
Food services involve high investment and operating costs, short  
design life cycles \(5–7 years\) and rationalisation of restaurant seat-  
ing and food preparation to ensure efficient use.  
• Basic/budget\: limited breakfast service or use of commercial res-  
taurant operated independently  
• Mid-grade/full service\: single restaurant with adjacent bar and

• High-grade\: room service of meals provided with service  
pantries on guest floors. Most large high-grade hotels offer a  
multiple choice of restaurants, including main, coffee shop/bras-  
serie, ethnic cuisines and speciality themed designs. The largest  
is adapted for breakfast \(mainly self-service\). Food production  
is centralised with zoned areas for storage, preparation and  
cooking. Direct access is required to individual finishing areas  
designed to serve each restaurant, Figure 21.17.  
Typically, a sophisticated cocktail lounge and bar is located  
near the main restaurants and a general bar/lounge to provide a  
focus for relaxation. Refreshments are also served in the lobby  
lounge and some luxury hotels provide a café style tearoom for  
daytime visitors.  
Typical areas required per seats are given in Table III.

# 6 CASE STUDIES  
# 6.1 Travelodge, Southwark, London architect\: Dexter  
# Moren Associates  
*Introduction*  
This 202 bedroom hotel is for budget hotel brand Travelodge and is  
situated close to Tate Modern at Bankside just south of the Thames  
in central London. See Figures 21.20–21.24.  
# 5 BACK OF HOUSE FACILITIES  
# 5.1 General  
Central support areas in hotels typically take up 12–14 per cent  
\(high standard\) to 7–8 per cent \(budget\) of the total built space.  
Requirements depend on the availability of offsite services. Most  
of the laundry, maintenance and refurbishing requirements are  
contracted out saving space and labour. Hotel facility management  
requires planned maintenance and life cycle replacements which  
can be specified and organised in advance\:  
• Services – general checklist  
• Loading docks – vehicle \(dimensions\), rubbish storage, pro-  
tection/screening, recycling facilities \(separation/compression/  
chilling\), delivery/security office  
• Storage – furniture/equipment/general. Food stores \(frozen/chilled/  
dry goods/vegetables\), access to service areas, transportation  
• Plant/technical – water supplies \(circulations\), heating/chilling  
\(combined power\) electric \(switchgear/generators\) workshops/  
offices  
• Housekeeping – laundry/sorting/storage/supervision, other  
stores, service lifts/control  
• Employees – entry control, personnel rooms, changing facilities/  
lockers, canteens/restrooms.  
*Site and restrictions*  
The 0.14 ha Union Street site is on the main pedestrian route from  
Southwark Station to the Tate Modern and backs onto rail viaducts.  
It is close to the landmark Palestra building.  
*Solution*  
At street level, the 6105 m2 building features a tall glazed  
ground floor designed as sub-divisible commercial outlets.  
Internally, the spaces are conceived as a ‘donut’ form around  
a central courtyard and accommodate 202 bedrooms, a bar and  
60-seater restaurant facilities. Bedrooms range from 15 m2 to  
21 m2  
.  
The building incorporates two very different elevational lan-  
guages relating directly to the surrounding context, the Palestra  
building in particular. This has been achieved by using silver met-  
al-clad modules with blue vertical trims in a staggered rhythm. The  
rear elevations fronting rail viaducts have been designed as robust  
brick facades with regimented windows framed with blue metal  
hoods.  
‘Our sector is based on efficiency and maximising returns, a  
philosophy that DMA embraces, reflected in the fact that in some  
instances DMA have “found” up to 15 per cent extra bedrooms  
within the same envelope produced by their competitors’, says  
Travelodge development manager Rob Ryan. **21-16 Hotels**

# Dexter Moren Associates  
*Introduction*  
This 18416 m2 redevelopment provided a new 256-bedroom  
hotel for the luxury hotel chain InterContinental in London’s  
Westminster. See Figures 21.25–21.27.  
*The site*  
The project is a reworking of Queen Anne’s Chambers, a nine-  
teenth-century former hospital turned government office building.  
*Solution*  
The challenge was achieving a modern and coherent design within  
the constraints of the property’s disjointed historic structure. This  
required major architectural interventions including the creation of  
a new porte cochère leading guests into an atrium reception featur-  
ing a triangular glass skylight.  
Across the lower ground floor, structural modifications and 2 m  
of excavation were required to accommodate conference facilities  
and a 24 hour gym for hotel guests. In addition, DMA installed  
eight new lifts within two new lift cores and incorporated a grand **21-18 Hotels**  
elliptical feature staircase to the lower ground floor. Much of the  
original façade was restored and retained.  
On the ground floor, public spaces have been designed as a series  
of rooms that transition seamlessly into one another \(Figure 21.25\).  
The ground floor comprises reception, concierge, lobby lounge and  
Emmeline’s lounge. At the heart of the hotel is a smokehouse and  
pub with its own entrance.  
The hotel incorporates 256 new rooms including 30 studios, 14  
one-bedroom suites and a rooftop penthouse. These are arranged  
around four distinct wings and spread over six floors \(Figures  
21.26–21.27\). Rooms are an average of 30 m2, excluding suites and  
executive rooms.  
The hotel interior space planning design was completed by Dexter  
Moren Associates and IDStudio with interior finishes by RPW.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Historical background  
Successive governments have made attempts to influence or  
impose minimum space standards on housing over the last century  
ever since the Tudor Walters Report of 1918 reflected the ‘homes  
fit for heroes’ feeling of post-war social optimism.  
In 1961, the report *Homes for Today and Tomorrow*, which sub-  
sequently became widely known as the *Parker Morris Standards*,  
was published. The report coincided with an era of local authority  
housebuilding and the internal space standards set out in this report  
were imposed as mandatory on this tenure of housing in 1967.  
They did not apply to the private sector however and ceased to be  
mandatory in 1981.  
Post-Parker Morris Standards, the Housing Corporation \(HC\),  
who assumed responsibility for funding and subsidising local  
authority housing, did not initially lay down space standards.  
Instead, during the 1980s and 1990s, the HC funded schemes based  
upon gross internal areas banded according to probable occupan-  
cies. However, the bands were too broad to be regarded as space  
standards. Eventually, following a continuing decline in the stand-  
ards of homes being built, the HC introduced the *Housing Quality*  
*Indicators* \(HQIs\) in 1993. These included a target range of areas  
for dwellings of different occupancies. They did not set out space  
standards for individual rooms, but did include a schedule of furni-  
ture requirements that had an impact on room sizes.  
In 2007 the HC introduced the *Design and Quality Standards*.  
These applied to all new build, general needs grant-funded housing  
and were measured by an updated version of the HQIs.  
Housing programmes continued to operate according to these  
standards until the government’s Housing Standards Review in  
2015 resulted in the new *Technical Housing Standards*. These

incorporate an optional national housing space standard applicable  
to England across all tenures with further optional requirements  
for age-friendly accessible/wheelchair housing incorporated into  
Building Regulations.  
# 1.2 Public and private sector housing  
In Britain, as in many other countries, housing is divided into pri-  
vately and publicly funded sectors. Early in the twentieth century,  
the new local authorities \(LAs\) increasingly took over the provision  
of social \(publicly funded\) housing from charitable foundations  
\(such as the Peabody, William Sutton and Guinness Trusts\). The  
growth of social housing became such that in some urban boroughs  
most of the housing was in their ownership. More recently, this has  
been reversed by the growth of Housing Associations \(HAs\) and  
other Registered Providers \(RPs\). LAs were encouraged to transfer  
some, or even all, of their housing stock to HAs, or RPs.  
While historically the privately funded sector was geared to  
the provision of housing for rent, from the mid-twentieth century  
onwards it has provided for home ownership. However, private  
developers have a long tradition of resisting space standards  
imposed other than by the market. As a result, standards in this  
type of development are often cut to the minimum. Recently,  
however, there has been a resurgence in the provision of private  
rental housing – particularly apartments in urban centres. Known  
as the Build to Rent \(BtR\) sector, lifestyle and choice are prime  
considerations in attracting renters. As such, more generous space  
standards are generally provided.  
The social sector is very different. Tenants of social housing  
have less choice in their dwellings and the home is more likely to be  
fully occupied from the outset. Also, once the household is accom-  
modated, their ability to move home is limited so people must have  
the room to settle satisfactorily into what is likely to be their long-  
term home. This supports the case for ensuring, especially in the  
publicly funded sector, that reasonable standards are maintained.  
# 1.3 Housing for different users  
Housing not specifically designed for people with disabilities is  
known as general needs housing. However, a significant proportion  
of the population is disabled in some way. While many people with  
disabilities are able to cope in standard dwellings, others, such as  
those in wheelchairs, require substantial modifications to enable  
them to live satisfactorily. It very often falls to the social sector to  
provide non-mainstream housing, particularly where disability is  
involved. The allocation of social housing makes it more likely that  
homes designed with a particular user group in mind will be occu-  
pied by those who most need them. In contrast, most homes built  
for private sale are sold speculatively on the open market without  
any requirement to demonstrate need. This raises issues about flex-  
ibility and adaptability.  
*Approved Document M* of the Building Regulations, which deals  
with access to and use of buildings, was extended in 1999 to cover  
the requirements for disabled access to all new dwellings. This was  
an important development. It followed a gradual change in thinking  
**22-1** **22-2** **Houses and flats**  
that all housing should be accessible to people in wheelchairs. The  
introduction of requirements such as the provision of a toilet at  
entrance level, front door level access, and minimum corridor and  
door widths enable people to remain in their homes well into old age  
or infirmity, instead of having to move to more accessible special  
accommodation. The 2015 revision to *Approved Document M* went  
much further and set out optional enhanced standards for those with  
limited mobility and for wheelchair users. See Section 2.3.  
There is also an increasing demand for specialist older people’s  
housing in the form of retirement and extra care typologies. This  
form of housing is covered in Chapter 23. Housing for students and  
young people is covered in Chapter 24.  
rooms to be able to accommodate a basic set of furniture, fittings  
and activity and circulation space appropriate to the function of the  
room, derived from the HQIs.  
Table I demonstrates how the figures provided in the Ndss  
compare with previous space standards. Also shown are probable  
minimum areas for dwellings which are designed to meet the needs  
of occupants with limited mobility and wheelchair users.  
# 1.4 Dwelling areas  
For the reasons given earlier, it is important that social housing  
at least is not allowed to slip below the standards that came to be  
accepted as reasonable during the Parker Morris \(PM\) era. Research  
into housing built to PM standards has shown that while there may be  
much wrong with some aspects of estate design such as the confused  
and insecure arrangement of external spaces, there is usually a good  
level of satisfaction with the internal layout and space standards.  
The *Nationally described space standard* \(Ndss\), which was  
introduced as part of the *Technical Housing Standards*, continues  
to set out minimum gross internal floor areas for new dwellings.  
See Section 2.2. The given areas are determined by the need for  
# 1.5 Room areas  
In the social housing sector, the Parker Morris Standards came to be  
widely accepted for the minimum sizes of individual rooms. The origin  
of these figures, however, was not the Parker Morris committee, but is  
understood to have been the Greater London Council \(GLC\), which  
funded many HA projects in the capital in the 1970s and early 1980s.  
These room sizes were, and still are, widely adopted as reason-  
able, minimum, design standards for social housing. Many HAs  
and RPs still include them in their briefing documents to architects.  
Later standards did not contain minimum room sizes. Instead,  
they relied on a schedule of furniture requirements, activity and  
access zones which had to be accommodated. The *London Housing*  
*Design Guide* \(2010\) drew upon this guidance and expanded it to  
include minimum bedroom sizes and widths, and combined living  
space requirements. The Ndss also contains guidance on minimum  
bedroom sizes and widths. These are set out in Table II together  
with recommended areas for other rooms within a dwelling.

# 2.1 National Planning Policy Framework \(NPPF\)  
The NPPF is the legal framework for planning decisions,  
requiring planning applications to be determined in accord-  
ance with the development plan unless material considerations  
indicate otherwise. The development plan will consist of the  
local plan for the relevant local authority \(together with the  
London Plan in the case of London boroughs\) with more  
detailed guidance often produced as Supplementary Planning  
Documents \(SPD\).  
Policies in local plans or guidance in SPDs often include  
detailed design standards for housing and can relate to external  
amenity, privacy, overlooking, sustainability, car parking etc.  
They can also cover such areas as defining appropriate hous-  
ing density, external design and, in some cases, minimum room  
sizes. Although there is no minimum density prescribed in the  
NPPF, LAs often use density as a tool in assessing the accepta-  
bility of a proposal. Planning densities are normally expressed  
in dwellings per hectare \(or acre\) or habitable rooms per hectare  
\(or acre\). The definition of habitable rooms is normally taken  
to be all living rooms, bedrooms and dining kitchens \(the latter  
commonly only if more than 13 m2\). Densities for new housing  
commonly vary from around 150 habitable rooms per hectare  
\(60 habitable rooms per acre\) to 250 habitable rooms per hectare  
**Houses and flats** **22-3**  
\(100 habitable rooms per acre\), see Figures 22.1 and 22.2 for  
illustrations of layouts at these densities. Different planning  
authorities have widely differing minimum dimension require-  
ments, see Figure 22.3 for typical dimensions. Some authorities  
allow higher densities for non-family housing, or for areas close  
to urban centres or good transport links.  
Material considerations can cover broad and far reaching  
issues. Particular regard should be given to the effect of the  
proposal on the site’s surrounding context, its bulk, scale and  
massing in the street scene as well as the proposal’s effect on  
privacy, outlook and loss of daylight/sunlight. Other important  
material considerations include the contents of the NPPF as well  
as a proposal’s effect on the existing situation, for example,  
flood risk, ecology and energy footprint and the local transport  
network.  
Car parking requirements vary considerably between planning  
authorities. Inner city authorities may require only one space per  
house and less for a flat, but suburban areas may demand two or  
more spaces per house. Visitors’ spaces need to be added at 10 to  
20 per cent. Some authorities at present allow considerable relaxa-  
tion of their requirements for social housing, on the basis of lower  
than average recorded car ownership. There is also a movement  
towards ‘car free’ developments, for some sites that are particularly  
well served by public transport.

# 2.2 National Technical Housing Standards  
The National Technical Housing Standards \(2015\) replaced all  
other space standards used by LAs in England and included publi-  
cation of the *Technical Housing Standards – Nationally described*  
*space standard* \(Ndss\). The space standard is part of the planning  
system and is applied where there is a local plan policy based on  
evidenced local need, and where viability of development is not  
compromised.  
The space standard deals with internal space within new dwell-  
ings and can be applied across all tenures. It sets out requirements  
for the gross internal floor area of new dwellings at a defined level  
of occupancy as well as floor areas and dimensions for key parts  
of homes.  
The standard requires that\:  
• The dwelling provides at least the gross internal floor area and  
built-in storage area set out in Table III.  
• A dwelling with two or more bedspaces has at least one double  
\(or twin\) bedroom.  
• In order to provide one bedspace, a single bedroom has a floor  
area of at least 7.5 m2 and is at least 2.15 m wide.  
• In order to provide two bedspaces, a double \(or twin bedroom\)  
has a floor area of at least 11.5 m2  
.  
• One double \(or twin bedroom\) is at least 2.75 m wide and every  
other double \(or twin\) bedroom is at least 2.55 m wide.  
• Any area with a headroom of less than 1.5 m is not counted  
within the gross internal area unless used solely for storage \(if  
the area under the stairs is to be used for storage, assume a gen-  
eral floor area of 1 m2 within the gross internal area\).  
• Any other area that is used solely for storage and has a headroom  
of 900–1500 mm \(such as under eaves\) is counted at 50 per cent  
of its floor area, and any area lower than 900 mm is not counted  
at all.  
• A built-in wardrobe counts towards the gross internal area and  
bedroom floor area requirements, but should not reduce the  
effective width of the room below the minimum widths set  
out earlier. The built-in area in excess of 0.72 m2 in a double  
bedroom and 0.36 m2 in a single bedroom counts towards the  
built-in storage requirement.

The Building Regulations apply to all tenures of housing. The guid-  
ance listed in Table IV applies in England; the devolved nations  
each have their own set of Building Regulations.  
While the guidance in this section is correct at the time of going  
to press, it should be noted that revisions to guidance on raising  
accessibility in new dwellings are under way.  
*Approved Document M Volume 1* applies specifically to dwell-  
ings and contains requirements which affect the spatial layout.  
There are three categories of dwelling\:  
• Category 1\: visitable dwellings\: enables most people, including  
wheelchair users, to enter the dwelling and access rooms and  
sanitary facilities at entrance level \(See Table V\)  
• Category 2\: accessible and adaptable dwellings\: enables most  
people to access the dwelling, and has features which make it  
suitable for a wide range of occupants, including those with  
reduced mobility \(See Table VI\)  
• Category 3\: wheelchair dwellings, suitable for wheelchair users  
\(See Table VII\).  
All new dwellings must comply with Category 1 requirements  
as a minimum. Categories 2 and 3 are optional and only apply if  
imposed as a planning condition.

The effect on dwelling size of complying with the Ndss and  
the differing requirements outlined in Tables V–VII can be seen in  
Figures 22.9a–d.  
# 2.4 Scotland  
Space standards were removed from Scottish Building Regulations  
in 1987. The regularly updated *Building Standards Technical*  
*Handbook 2020\: Domestic* gives guidance on the design of dwell-  
ings, including some spatial requirements, but does not give  
**Houses and flats** **22-7**  
minimum dwelling sizes. It makes reference to Parker Morris  
Standards and Lifetime Homes principles \(see Section 3.1\).  
# 2.5 Wales  
The *Welsh Development Quality Requirements* \(2021\) set out the  
minimum functional quality standards for all general needs funded  
housing. The new standard focuses on housing quality, innovation,  
sustainability, flexibility, safety and security. It includes minimum  
gross internal floor areas that, for the most part, match or exceed  
the Ndss standards which apply in England, although a single bed-  
room can be a minimum of 6.5 m2 with a minimum width of 2.1 m.  
Other standards to be met include Lifetime Homes and Secured by  
Design \(Section 3.3\).  
# 2.6 Northern Ireland  
In Northern Ireland, the Department for Communities is responsible  
for the *Housing Association Development Guide Design Standards*  
which apply to all funded or part-funded new build housing.  
Dwelling sizes should fall within the relevant area band and also  
meet Lifetime Homes \(plus additional requirements\), Secured by  
Design and energy and sustainability requirements. Internal space  
standards are based on the standards given in the National Housing  
Federation publication *Standards and Quality in Development\: a*  
*good practice guide*.  
# 2.7 Greater London Authority \(GLA\) – London Plan  
In 2010, the Mayor of London set out the aspirations for the design  
of all new housing in the capital in the form of the *London Housing*  
*Design Guide*. The guide promoted better neighbourhoods, high  
environmental standards, better accessibility and better design  
and included new minimum standards for the amount of floor  
space and private outdoor space, as well as guidance on natural  
light and ceiling heights. These standards were more far reach-  
ing than all other standards in place at that time. The GLA took  
over responsibility for housing standards within London in 2012  
and the standards became mandatory for all tenures of housing.  
The current London Plan Guidance for housing design draws on  
this guidance and reflects the current national *Technical Housing*  
*Standards*. Of particular note is the requirement for private outside  
space for every dwelling, in the form of a garden, balcony, terrace  
or winter garden. A minimum of 5 m2 of private outdoor space  
should be provided for 1–2 person dwellings and an extra 1 sqm  
should be provided for each additional occupant. The minimum  
depth and width for all balconies and other private external spaces  
should be 1500 mm.

There are several other important standards that include dimen-  
sional and spatial requirements for dwellings. These are not  
covered by statutory control but are often required.  
# 3.1 Lifetime Homes  
The concept of ‘Lifetime Homes’ was initially published and  
promoted by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF\) in the early  
1990s, with the aim of constructing dwellings that can be more eas-  
ily adapted to cope with residents’ future disabilities, should these  
arise. Such disabilities could be either temporary, such as resulting  
from an accidental injury, or permanent, from accident or illness.  
The recommendations were based on five principles\: inclusiv-  
ity, accessibility, adaptability, sustainability and good value. They  
took the form of 16 points covering the planning and construction  
of new dwellings. HAs and RPs widely adopted Lifetime Homes as  
part of their design briefs.  
In England, the legacy of the Lifetime Homes Standard has now  
been taken forward through Building Regulations in the form of  
optional Building Regulations Approved Document M Category 2  
Accessible and adaptable dwellings \(Table VI\).  
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the standards for Lifetime  
Homes may still be required for funded housing as noted previously.  
# 3.2 British Standard 9266\:2013 design of accessible and  
# adaptable general needs housing  
While many British Standards have elements that can be applied to  
housing design, BS 9266\:2013 is a code of practice which specifi-  
cally gives advice on the design of accessible and adaptable general  
needs housing. It is concerned largely with access to, within and  
use of, residential buildings covering both new build and refurbish-  
ment of general needs housing both in the form of flats and houses.  
Although not mandatory in its application, many housing providers  
require compliance with relevant British Standards as part of their  
brief. BS 9266 is similar to *Approved Document M Category 2* in  
the main, but exceeds it in some of its requirements, as noted in  
Table VIII.  
# Table VIII BS 9266\: summary of key requirements  
**Houses and flats** **22-9**  
SBD is not a mandatory standard but should be applied as good  
practice and may be a specific client requirement.  
The importance of security in the design of housing was  
recognised in the Housing Standards Review and resulted in  
a new Building Regulation; *Approved Document Q*\: Security.  
This regulation applies to new dwellings, including conver-  
sions but is limited to the building envelope only – not the  
external layout.  
# 3.4 Building for a Healthy Life  
Building for a Healthy Life \(BHL\) is an industry standard,  
endorsed by the government, for well-designed homes and neigh-  
bourhoods, based on the NPPF. It is intended to reflect the vision  
that new housing developments should be attractive, functional  
and sustainable.  
BHL consists of 12 considerations designed to help structure  
discussions between local communities, the local planning author-  
ity and the development team. It is a useful tool, which can be used  
to help demonstrate how a residential development provides a  
high-quality external living environment. See Table IX.  
# Table IX Building for a Healthy Life considerations  
# Integrated  
# neighbourhoods Distinctive places Streets for all  
Natural connections Making the most of what is Healthy streets  
there  
Walking, cycling A memorable character Cycle and car parking

Facilities and Well defined streets and spaces Green and blue infrastructure  
services \(soft landscaping and water  
features\)  
Homes for everyone Easy to find your way around Back of pavement, front of home  
\(the space between the two\)  
BHL is not mandatory, but many local planning authorities  
adopt the guidance to help them assess the quality of proposed and  
completed developments and use it as a point of reference in the  
preparation of local design policies.  
# Externally  
• Where designated accessible parking bays are provided, they should be 3600 mm ×  
6600 mm for parallel parking and 3600 mm × 6000 mm for perpendicular and  
echelon parking facilities.  
• Setting-down points should be provided on firm and level ground and no more  
than 50 m from an individual house or the communal entrance of a block of flats.  
# Internally  
• In blocks of flats, the effective clear width of entrance doors, and associated lobby  
and communal hallway doors, should be at least 1000 mm.  
• A clear level space of at least 1500 mm × 1500 mm should be available in front of  
each individual flat entrance door, to enable a wheelchair user to turn.  
• On private stairs, the rise of each step should be between 150 mm and 200 mm,  
and the going of each step should be between 250 mm and 320 mm.  
• A 300 mm clear space to the side of the leading edge of a swing door \(on the opening  
side\) should be provided for all rooms within an individual house or flat transportation.  
• In dwellings of two or more storeys, step-free vertical should be provided in  
the form of a vertical lifting platform or home lift, where the accessible WC,  
accessible shower, living space and a bed space are not all on the entrance level.  
• Provision of an accessible WC and washbasin \(not a hand rinse basin\) at entrance level.  
• Provision of a clear manoeuvring circle of 1500 mm diameter in the main bedroom.  
• Provision of a temporary bed space on the entrance level, where there is no  
permanent bedroom on that level.  
• Provision of a manoeuvring space of 1500 mm × 1500 mm internally, adjacent to a balcony.  
# 3.3 Secured by Design  
Secured by Design \(SBD\) is a UK Police initiative that combines  
the principles of ‘designing out crime’ with physical security. *SBD*  
*Homes 2019* is the source document for achieving a Secured by  
Design award. It addresses the community safety and security  
requirements for most types of housing development including  
individual houses, housing estates and low- and high-rise apart-  
ment blocks.  
# 4 DESIGN DATA  
# 4.1 Kitchens  
Kitchens have traditionally been planned around a ‘work trian-  
gle’, with the sink, cooker and fridge placed to form the points  
of a triangle. The total length of the triangle would be 5 m to  
7 m. However, many kitchens these days form part of a larger  
open-plan family room so it may be preferable to create sepa-  
rate zones instead for food preparation, cooking, serving and  
washing up. Each zone should have sufficient workspace, storage  
and appliances for its particular function. Where possible, it is  
often preferable to locate appliances such as washing machines  
in another room.  
There are a number of recognised layouts for kitchens\: galley,  
L-shaped, U-shaped and island.  
Galley kitchens are the only option in a narrow space, either in  
the form of a single line of units down one side, or units down both  
sides if there is enough width. 1.0 m minimum between opposing  
units is recommended, to give sufficient room to open doors and  
manoeuvre comfortably. When planning a single row, it is recom-  
mended that there is 1200 mm between the hob and the sink, with  
400 mm clear work surface either side of the hob.  
L-shaped kitchens are a simple and practical option that may  
allow a table to be incorporated in the remaining area of the room.  
For the optimum layout, position the sink halfway down one run  
of units and the cooking area halfway down the other. U-shaped  
kitchens are an ideal layout for creating a work triangle, and also  
provide a generous amount of storage space. An island is ideal  
for cutting down on distances and restoring the work triangle **22-10** **Houses and flats**

# 4.4 Storage  
The lack of storage is often a major problem in new homes. Parker  
Morris set good standards for storage. This proved popular at the time  
and is still the case. PM specified that a large part of the general stor-  
age space should be at ground level, accessible from circulation areas  
rather than from rooms. It was not intended that the loft space should  
count, as this is not normally conveniently accessible and trussed rafter  
construction makes the space much less useable. However boarding to  
at least part of the loft does create valuable extra storage space.  
In addition to general storage space, Parker Morris also stipu-  
lated space for hanging outdoor clothes in the entrance hall, a space  
for a pram \(1400 × 700\) in houses for three persons or more, and a  
linen cupboard, all of which remain good practice today.  
Bedroom cupboards such as built-in wardrobes were not stip-  
ulated. These can be valuable especially for low-income families.  
However, they need to be carefully planned in order to prevent  
them making the bedrooms less furnishable.  
The *Design and Quality Standards*, in 2007, reiterated the need  
for good storage, although the requirements were not as generous  
as Parker Morris. They did specify however, that for units with  
1–4 bed spaces, there should be lockable external storage space of  
at least 2.2 m2. For units with greater than four bed spaces, there  
should be at least 3.0 m2 of external storage space. Where a garage is  
provided the external storage requirement may be deemed satisfied.  
The *Ndss* requires an amount of internal storage as shown in  
Table XII.

In accessible and adaptable dwellings, and wheelchair user  
dwellings, it should be possible to install a stair lift. A minimum  
staircase width of 850 mm is required to achieve this.  
Building Regulations do not rule out winders \(tapered treads\)  
on stairs provided that certain minimum dimensions are met.  
However, winders are intrinsically less easily negotiated and more  
hazardous, especially for young children and older people. It is  
important that large wardrobes and other furniture can be taken up  
and down the stairs. This needs to be carefully planned for, espe-  
cially in three-storey houses, where the soffit of the upper flight  
can restrict the head height over the lower flight, and winders make  
the problems worse. It is possible \(at additional cost\) to install a  
stair lift to stairs with winders although a straight flight staircase  
is preferable and some HAs and RPs do not accept staircases with  
winders for the reasons stated earlier.  
See also Section 7.4 regarding alternating tread staircases which  
are permitted for access to one bedroom in a loft conversion.  
# 4.5 Ceiling heights  
These have not been covered by Building Regulations since 1985.  
Despite this, the old standard of 2.3 m should still be considered  
the minimum reasonable ceiling height for domestic buildings and  
2.4 m is preferable. The *Ndss*, where applied, requires a minimum  
of 2.3 m across 75 per cent of the relevant floor area. London Plan  
Guidance not only prefers a minimum of 2.5 m to all dwellings but  
it ‘encourages’ 2.6 m, particularly in ground floor dwellings.  
For rooms in the roof, floor areas are calculated to include only  
those parts where the ceiling height exceeds 1.5 m \(Figure 22.14\).  
# 4.6 Staircases  
Common stairs in blocks of flats should have a minimum width of  
1200 mm \(between enclosing walls\) and are covered in Approved  
Document K. For stairs that form part of a means of escape, refer  
also to *Approved Document B*.  
Building Regulations do not contain a minimum width of stair  
for general needs single-family houses; however, 800 mm should  
be the minimum reasonable clear stair width.  
# 5 FAMILY HOUSES  
# 5.1 General  
There is now a broad consensus that, where possible, families with  
children should be housed at ground level in single-family houses, or  
in ground floor flats or ground and first floor maisonettes with direct  
entrances. It is not just that children need private gardens. Equally, if  
not more importantly, the shared entrances, staircases and corridors  
in blocks of flats, and the external spaces around them, have proved  
to be largely incompatible with family life. This is especially true in  
the public sector, where the resources to overcome the management  
and maintenance problems of communal areas are very limited. **22-14** **Houses and flats**  
# 5.2 Orientation and gardens  
The relationship between the family dwelling and the adjacent public  
domain \(i.e. the highway, the street, court, or much less satisfactorily  
the footpath\) should be as clear and simple as possible. A private,  
front garden, with front gate and front path leading to the front door,  
and with minimum length of 2 to 3 m has proven benefits as defen-  
sible space. This is not to say that successful houses cannot be built  
without a front garden or with the front door opening directly, or  
via an inset porch, from the public pavement. There are many thou-  
sands of quite satisfactory houses planned like this notably in the  
Victorian inner cities; but in these cases, the pavement is clearly part  
of the publicly maintained highway. When there is an intervening  
‘confused’ space that is neither public nor private but needs to be  
communally managed, this is rarely satisfactory, and often leads to  
neglect. Similarly, rear gardens benefit from simplicity and clarity  
of relationship to the house and of enclosure. Communal space is  
best kept either to a minimum or omitted altogether. Such is the con-  
cern about security that opinion is generally against any provision of  
rear access, especially from unsupervised rear pathways, even when  
these are of practical convenience, such as in uninterrupted terraces.  
Orientation of the dwelling for best sunlight should not normally  
take precedence over achieving simple, clear relationships of private  
and public domains. However, within the dwelling it should normally  
be possible to arrange for one of the two day rooms \(living room or  
dining kitchen\) to get direct sunlight for a large part of the day. It is pref-  
erable for one of these rooms to face the front permitting supervision  
of the street, and for the other to face the rear giving direct garden  
access. Another factor is the potential for passive solar gain in the win-  
ter through the simple expedient of larger double-glazed windows on  
the southern elevation. Planning guidance in London seeks to heavily  
restrict single aspect dwellings, particularly if they are north facing.  
# 5.3 Height  
Although the majority of family houses are of two storeys, two-and-  
a-half, three and four storeys can be appropriate in urban areas. The  
expense of building taller is usually more than compensated for by  
savings in foundations and roofs, making this an economical type.  
Four-storey houses, however, will require the provision of a protected  
staircase combined with a domestic sprinkler system to eliminate the  
need for an alternative escape route from the upper floors.  
# 5.4 Frontage widths  
Because of the costs of providing roads and services infrastructure, there  
is often pressure to build narrow frontage houses – especially in urban  
areas. Anything less than 4.8 m internal width can be considered narrow  
frontage. Although satisfactory houses have been built with frontages of  
4.0 m, the stresses on internal planning start to build up below approx-  
imately 4.5 m. A reasonable minimum could be taken to be 4.3 m  
frontage. Below this width, rear gardens also become apologetic.  
Taking 4.8 m as a typical terrace house frontage, Figure 22.15  
shows a two-bedroom, four-person, two-storey house; Figure 22.16

storey house.  
# 5.5 Internal planning  
Opinions differ over the relative positions of living room and  
kitchen. In narrow frontage houses where the living room needs to  
occupy most of the full width of the front of the house, the dining  
kitchen will therefore tend to be at the rear, where it can provide a  
route to the garden. In three- or four-storey houses this sometimes  
works well in combination with a front living room at first floor  
level as in Figures 22.18 and 22.19. Rooms can then be full width,  
and offer good outlook and supervision both to the front and rear,  
as well as benefiting from sunlight with almost any orientation.  
Figure 22.18 shows a medium frontage plan with a through din-  
ing/kitchen and first floor living room. Figure 22.20 shows a wider  
plan which gives greater flexibility. It allows the living room to  
be at the front or rear of the dwelling depending on its orientation.  
In this instance, it is also possible to provide a first floor layout to  
suit the private for sale sector \(with an extra en-suite\) or the social  
sector.  
# 5.6 Living/dining versus kitchen/diner  
Certain types, such as Figure 22.15, have the great advantage of  
offering alternative ground floor plans with the dining space in  
either the living room or the kitchen; also the possibility of open-  
ing the two spaces into one. Use of the kitchen/diner is generally  
preferable and suits current lifestyles better as it offers two recep-  
tion rooms allowing greater flexibility for active family life. This  
arrangement also ensures that one reception room will receive sun-  
light for much of the day.  
# 5.7 Homeworking  
In recent times, there has been an increased need for many to work  
from home, yet many homes are poorly designed for homeworking.  
There should be a flexible space which can be turned over for work-  
ing if required. Suitable spaces might include within bedrooms, a  
landing or hallway alcove, living room or beneath stairs. Ideally,  
the space would be self-contained. Wherever a space is located,  
consideration must be given to the provision of generous natural  
light and sufficient services.  
# 5.8 Bathrooms  
The main bathroom should preferably be located on the floor with  
the most bedrooms. In three-storey houses, this might be the first  
or the second floor. A ground floor WC is now a requirement in  
all family houses, however small \(*Building Regulations Approved*  
*Document Part M4\[1\]*\). Although there is no longer a legal prohibi-  
tion of WCs opening directly from kitchens, this arrangement is not  
normally either popular or advised. An exception might sometimes  
be a utility room containing a WC and forming the route to the  
garden. WCs must always have a hand basin \(*Building Regulation*  
*Approved Document G*\).  
In larger family houses with four or more bedrooms, a sec-  
ond bathroom or shower room, is desirable. This can be useful in  
three-storey houses, as it can mean having a WC on each floor. One  
bathroom or shower room can be en-suite with the main bedroom;  
however, this has not normally been considered to be appropriate  
in social housing.  
In private sector housing, it is normal to provide one family  
bathroom plus en-suite shower rooms to the master bedroom and  
any further double bedroom. Thus in a four bed, seven-person  
house, there would normally be a family bathroom and two en-suite  
shower rooms.  
# 5.9 Multi-generational houses  
The affordability of housing and the cost of child care and elderly  
care has led to the development of multi-generation houses, which  
provide a flexible home for extended families who want to live  
together while retaining a degree of mutual independence. An  
example is shown in Figure 22.21. This example shows a three-bed-  
room dwelling with a one-bedroom annex with a shared courtyard.  
# 5.10 Design of external areas  
Refuse storage space is almost always needed at the front of the  
house, Figure 22.22. The location for the dustbins or ‘wheelie-bin’  
needs to be clearly identified, for example, by partial enclosure or  
change of paving surface. It needs to be close to the highway, the  
front gate and path, and not too far from the front or kitchen door. It  
should not be where smells would cause a problem, such as imme-  
diately under the window of a habitable room.  
Refuse storage requirements can vary from area to area. Many  
now require two ‘wheelie-bins’, one for general waste and one for  
recycling. Others have a requirement for a number of containers for  
different types of recycling. Many also offer an option to have one  
specifically for garden waste. Designers must check local require-  
ments to ensure refuse storage is properly integrated into the design  
at an early stage in the process.  
In 2015, the government published guidance on suitable provi-  
sion for proper waste storage in new homes to tackle ‘bin blight’ **Houses and flats** **22-17**  
**22.21** *A three-bedroom house with a one bed annex and a shared courtyard multi-generational house designed for the social sector*  
**22.22** *Front garden of a terraced house showing refuse and cycle storage* **22-18** **Houses and flats**  
of bins dominating residential streets and contributing to increased  
odour and roadside litter. This includes both covert storage units  
for residents’ bins, or simply ensuring that there is space for bins  
to be stored in backyards so that they are taken out only on bin-col-  
lection day.  
Meter positions can sometimes be integrated with that of bins,  
so that one can partially mask the other.  
The function of a front garden enclosure is different from that  
of the rear garden, and this should be reflected in the design, as in  
Figure 22.22.  
Front fences, railings or walls should allow visual surveillance,  
both ways. A height of between 800 mm and 1300 mm is usually  
appropriate, and it is useful if the enclosure can be seen through  
below this level  
Enclosure of rear gardens is simpler. An impermeable wall or  
fence of approximately 1.8 m height is normally recommended  
at the far end. The side \(party fence\) enclosures can be reduced  
to approximately 1.2 m. Most people seem to welcome some  
garden-to-garden contact with their neighbours, though not imme-  
diately next to the house, where a greater height is preferred. If  
gates are provided in rear garden walls or fences, these should be  
full height \(at least 1.8 m\) and lockable.  
# 6 PURPOSE-BUILT FLATS  
# 6.1 General  
A block of flats nearly always involves shared entrances, stairs,  
landings, balconies or lobbies, and often one or more lifts. These  
features tend to make flats undesirable for families with children.  
In many developments, one would expect the majority of flats to be  
two-bedroom, with a lesser number of one-bedroom and three-bed-  
room flats.  
Common areas and facilities become exponentially more diffi-  
cult to manage with increasing numbers of flats in the block. Small  
blocks of four or six flats are easier to manage than those where  
the numbers get into double figures. Shared systems such as entry  
phones rely upon responsible behaviour. This is more achievable  
with a small number of households who know each other. London  
Plan Guidance has a requirement for a maximum of eight dwellings  
per floor served off a single stair core and this can be considered  
good practice \(Figure 22.23\). There is also the need to consider the  
provision of ventilation and natural daylighting to common areas.  
# 6.2 Height of blocks  
Parker Morris stipulated the maximum walk-up to a flat front door  
to be two storeys. Blocks of up to three storeys, without lifts, later  
became commonplace. Four-storey blocks without lifts are on the  
limit of acceptability. For five storeys and above, a lift is essen-  
tial. *Approved Document M Category 2* and *Approved Document*  
*M Category 3* require ‘step-free access to all dwellings above or  
below ground level’ and therefore makes the provision of lifts a  
statutory requirement where they are implemented.  
# 6.3 Common stairs and corridors  
Common corridors and lobbies are generally required to be smoke  
vented in order to prevent smoke and the products of fire in a flat  
**22.23** *Upper floor of a block of flats containing five flats per stair core, with a mix of one bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom*  
*flats* from reaching the fire protected common escape stair. This can  
be achieved by natural smoke venting to external air via an AOV  
\(automatic opening ventilator\) or an internal smoke shaft. Note  
that AOVs are not permitted in buildings over 30 m in height.  
Protected enclosures should also be provided with a smoke vent at  
the top storey, linked to open upon activation of the corridor vents.  
Alternatively, a mechanical smoke exhaust or pressure differential  
system can be utilised. Dry risers and possibly fire-fighting lifts,  
staircases and lobbies may be required in certain arrangements  
depending on building heights and floor areas.  
Common corridor lengths are normally determined by the lim-  
itations of travel distance allowed for means of escape. These are  
7.5 m where a single direction of escape exists or 30 m if alter-  
natives routes are available. The provision of designed smoke  
control systems can allow for extended travel distances. Also, the  
provision of sprinkler coverage within the flats enables the travel  
distance to be doubled.  
In small single stair buildings \(with no more than four storeys  
and no floor level over 11 m above ground\) some allowances are  
made. If there are only two flats per storey these can open directly  
into the stair core as long as the flats have internal fire protected  
hallways. If the travel distance in a common lobby or corridor  
does not exceed 4.5 m then the lobby/corridor is not required to  
be smoke vented. The stair enclosure must still be provided with a  
smoke vent as noted previously.  
Designers should also be aware of the potential problem of com-  
mon areas over-heating if not adequately ventilated. BS 5925\:1991  
recommends that a free area of 1/50th of the floor area is provided  
for adequate ventilation.  
# 6.4 Internal flat layouts  
For fire safety purposes any flat that has an internal travel distance  
of over 9 m from the entrance door to any point of accommoda-  
tion must be provided with a cellular layout around an internal  
fire protected hallway, that in itself must not exceed 9 m length.  
Open-plan layouts are possible if they fall within this limit or  
if sprinklers are provided. Duplexes require alternative escape  
routes from the non-entrance levels, unless either a sprinkler  
system is installed or an internal fire protected hall, landing and  
stairway is formed and an automatic fire detection system pro-  
vided.  
Open-plan layouts areas make the maximum use of space  
and have thus become ubiquitous, particularly in smaller flats.  
However, they can be problematic if there are many activities  
going on in the one space. In particular, a space for home working  
should be provided, wherever possible, preferably capable of being  
self-contained, with generous natural light.  
# 6.5 Build to Rent \(BtR\)  
In recent years, an acute housing shortage and soaring land values  
have led to an unprecedented rise in prices. Over the same time,  
the provision of affordable housing has plummeted. As a result,  
it is now much harder for young, single professionals to purchase  
a flat, or to trade-up to a house in many urban cities. Now, many  
who want to buy are forced to flat-share into their late thirties and  
even forties.  
This has led to the recent growth of the BtR sector, also known  
as the private rented sector \(PRS\). Typical dwellings are self-con-  
tained one-bedroom flats for single occupancy, for which the  
*Nationally described space standard* \(where applied\) recommends  
a minimum area of 39 m2 \(or 37 m2 where there is a shower room  
instead of a bathroom\). See Figure 22.24.  
Larger dwellings will usually have equal sized bedrooms with  
en-suite facilities and shared living facilities. The ‘dumb-bell’  
plan illustrated in Figure 22.25 puts a bedroom and bath or shower  
room each side of the living space. Although intended for young  
sharers, this typology could work well for a number of other occu-  
pants.

Often shared spaces such as residents’ lounges, communal  
working and meeting spaces, roof terraces and fitness centres are  
also provided.  
Most BtR schemes tend to deliver just apartment accommoda-  
tion. However, there is a growing demand for private rented family  
size housing, such as three-bedroom duplexes with private outside  
space. **22-20** **Houses and flats**  
# 6.6 Multi-generational flats  
Multi-generational flats with one connecting room, such as a kitchen/  
dining room, but two separate units, are an emerging typology,  
Figure 22.26. These cater to families who wish to care for the older  
generation or to help younger families bring up children with the  
grandparents on hand, saving on childcare costs and making it easier  
to go back to work. Additionally, this typology would suit families  
where adult children return to live in the family home.  
# 6.7 Stacking of similar rooms  
All party floors have to provide sound insulation; but the levels of  
insulation that are mandatory cannot prevent all noise nuisance,  
and it is best if similar rooms are stacked one above the other. The  
worst combination is for a living room directly above another flat’s  
bedroom.  
# 6.8 Configuration of rooms around the common stairs  
The minimum levels of sound insulation specified in the Building  
Regulations between all habitable rooms in flats and the common  
parts of the block are less than fully satisfactory and the adoption  
of higher performance standards is always preferable. It is desir-  
able therefore to situate bedrooms away from the common stairs,  
Figure 22.27; and particularly, well away from any lift shaft.  
It is usually preferable to plan day rooms at the front and bed-  
rooms at the quieter rear, perhaps alongside the kitchen. There are  
however, many examples of small blocks of flats with bedrooms  
**22.26** *Typical intergenerational flat designed for the private rented sector. a\) Arranged as inter-connected dwellings with a shared*  
*kitchen/dining space; b\) Arranged as two separate dwellings* **Houses and flats** **22-21**  
**22.27** *Block of one and two-bedroom flats with bedrooms located away from lift and stairs. Lobbies between stairs and flats are*  
*required in larger blocks*  
at the front alongside the stairs, and living rooms at the rear. This  
plan form combines the worst exposure of the bedrooms to noise  
nuisance from the common stairs with the least satisfactory orien-  
tation of day and night rooms.  
# 6.9 Balcony access  
Balcony or deck access was largely discredited by the social fail-  
ures of much of the deck access, medium-rise, LA housing built in  
the 1960s and 1970s. However, some of the smaller, self-contained  
balcony access flat blocks built between the wars have proved quite  
satisfactory in long-term use. Balcony or deck access can avoid the  
squalor associated with wholly internal common circulation areas  
and provide cross-ventilation \(an advantage in avoiding over-heat-  
ing\) but they can also enable the planning of large extended blocks,  
with too many flats using a single entrance and stair.  
A potential problem with balcony access flats is the dual aspect  
nature; some windows are directly onto the balcony \(Figure 22.28\).  
These can be unpopular, owing to lack of privacy and the security  
risks. Kitchens and bathrooms tend to be placed on the balcony  
side, but residents dislike strangers passing close to their kitchen  
sinks. There is also the potential for means of escape to be restricted  
\(compromised\) in the event of smoke from fire escaping out of flat  
windows. However, with careful design and a reasonable limit on  
the number of flats served, balcony or deck access has become more  
widely acceptable.  
# 6.10 Lifts  
Where provided in blocks of flats these should always be capa-  
ble of taking a wheelchair as noted in *Approved Document M* of  
the Building Regulations. Lifts in medium-rise flat blocks have  
become rather easier to plan, using hydraulic lifts with pump  
rooms at or near the base, as opposed to electric lifts with motor  
rooms at the top. Hydraulic pump rooms can be very compact  
and flexibly positioned. In blocks of flats with a floor level  
higher than 18 m above entrance level a firefighter’s lift must  
be provided. **22-22** **Houses and flats**  
**22.28** *Upper floor of a block of flats where one flat in the cluster*  
*is accessed via an external balcony*  
# 6.11 Refuse  
This is always a challenge with flats. Traditionally, social sector  
housing has used chutes. However, these can cause a noise nui-  
sance and tend to become blocked. Additionally, the inlet points  
and chambers at the base of the chutes can become particularly  
unsavoury.  
For large or tall blocks, Building Regulations have an implied  
recommendation for refuse chutes. For the reasons stated earlier,  
in actuality they are hardly ever provided. Even very tall blocks  
rely on ground level refuse storage chambers and residents using  
vertical transportation for disposal from flats. However, chutes are  
becoming more popular, evident in some new developments within  
the BtR sector, where blocks are well managed. If they are pro-  
vided, the base area needs to be carefully designed, with robust  
and easily cleaned surfaces, good access for cleaning and copious  
ventilation.  
If blocks of flats can be kept small \(up to six or eight flats\), then  
it is quite possible to provide a discreet but easily accessible area  
containing a separate rubbish bin for each flat, clearly and individ-  
ually marked, Figure 22.29.  
The maximum distance that residents should be required to  
carry waste to the storage point is 30 m. Waste collection vehicles  
should be able to get within 25 m of that point. Maximum reversing  
distances for vehicles will also have to be considered and this will  
have an impact on the building and road layouts.  
# 6.12 Incoming utilities\: meters and services ducts  
The provision of sufficient space for meters and services to the  
apartment block is paramount when planning the floor layouts, par-  
ticularly around the common access stairs, lobbies and corridors.  
It is usual to provide vertical risers to house all incoming services,  
such as electricity, gas, telecommunications, phone/video entry,  
cable TV, data cabling, and so forth. Access into these service ris-  
ers is often via fire doors opening onto the ventilated lobbies as  
discussed earlier.  
It is advisable to obtain advice and guidance from the relevant  
national and local service providers, particularly regarding location  
of meters and routing of their services. Gas routing needs special  
consideration as all spaces containing a gas pipe, meter, valve etc.  
need to be vented to prevent the building up of undetectable gas,  
which could lead to explosion.  
There may be a requirement for meter rooms to be designed into  
the ground floor or at basement level, to facilitate easy access by  
the providing authority. Routing from these meters rooms and the  
vertical risers will need careful consideration to avoid the risk of  
clashes with structure or compromising fire integrity.  
Horizontal routing of these services from the vertical service  
shafts into the apartments should also be considered at an early  
stage. Access for ongoing maintenance will be a consideration  
when choosing finishes to ceilings and floors.  
# 6.13 Design of external areas  
Communal gardens require good management by residents’ asso-  
ciation or landlord. Unless this is in place, shared external areas  
should be either minimised or avoided. Clearly, the latter is not  
entirely possible, as access is needed to the common front door.  
**22.29** *External planning for typical three-storey block of flats showing refuse storage* The route to this entrance should be as simple as possible\: broad  
and short. Areas to the sides of this access can be given to the  
ground floor flats as front gardens; and these will be much more  
successful if these flats have separate front doors independent of  
the common entrance. Similarly, the best use for the ground behind  
the block is normally as rear gardens for the ground floor flats.  
The enclosure of front and rear gardens to ground floor flats  
should be similar to that for single-family houses \(see Section 5.2\).  
The shared approach to the main entrance door should be treated  
rather differently. If there is no unallocated garden space, there will  
be no fencing except on either side of this approach.  
If there is any soft landscaping along the shared approach route,  
it needs to be carefully planned to withstand limited care. If flanked  
by well cared for private gardens, then the common approach path  
is best left as good quality hard landscaping and paving.  
The importance of having access to private amenity space has  
been emphasised in recent times, particularly for flats. External  
space for upper-floor flats is often provided by private balconies  
or terraces. If these can be designed with an ability to be converted  
into winter gardens in the colder months, a more useable space for  
leisure, or home working, can be provided all year round.  
The recommended minimum areas for private balconies is a mini-  
mum of 5 m2 for 1–2 person dwellings with an extra 1 m2 provided for  
each additional occupant. A minimum width and depth of 1500 mm  
should provide sufficient space for either a meal around a small table,  
clothes drying or for the occupants to sit outside with visitors.  
# 7 CONVERSIONS  
# 7.1 General  
The conversion of large houses into self-contained flats in the  
1970s and 1980s used to be the stock-in-trade of inner city housing  
providers, as well as private developers. There has been a falling  
off of this type of project but there remain many situations where  
conversions of existing buildings in sensitive urban areas and con-  
servation areas are relevant.  
# 7.2 Planning  
Splitting up a single-family house involves creating at least one  
new dwelling, and thereby constitutes ‘development’ under the  
Planning Acts. Unlike extending a single-family house by an  
allowed percentage of its volume, this is not ‘permitted develop-  
ment’. Therefore, house conversions require planning permission  
that allows planning authorities to control this type of development  
if they feel that it is eroding the balance of single-family houses in  
the district.  
Houses that are statutorily listed have more onerous constraints  
and require Listed Building Consent for any demolition \(however  
small\). Certain restraints also apply to all properties within conser-  
vation areas. Conservation area approval is no longer required for  
a small amount of demolition, such as of an outhouse; but a pro-  
posal of this nature might well lead to a spot-listing, when a Listed  
Building Consent would then be required. In many of these cases,  
the planning authority and/or Historic England may then get very  
involved in detailed design and aesthetics.  
This introduces the first discipline when dealing with an exist-  
ing house, which is to respect its existing qualities and character.  
A natural conversion should aim to keep well-proportioned rooms  
intact wherever possible. This commonly means at least the main  
front rooms at ground and first floor levels. Avoid boxed-in lobbies  
in the corners of previously good rooms. These disrupt original dec-  
orative elements such as cornices and picture rails, and also make  
the rooms more difficult to furnish. Another implicit aspect of nat-  
ural conversions is the aim to keep similar rooms stacked over each  
other. Day rooms of one flat should not be planned over bedrooms  
of another flat and bathrooms and kitchens are best stacked, thereby  
simplifying drainage and plumbing.  
**Houses and flats** **22-23**  
The same considerations about accommodation for families  
with children apply as for new build. Family dwellings should be  
at ground and/or basement level, or at least have direct street entry  
and garden access. This will usually mean only one large unit in  
the conversion of a house, with one or more smaller units over it. In  
a wish to reduce the common areas, many conversions have been  
built the ‘wrong way up’ with a large unit over a one-bedroom  
flat at ground floor level. This is unsatisfactory, especially in social  
housing. Family life is noisy, and does not fit well over single peo-  
ple or couples.  
However it should be the aim to abolish or minimise common  
areas and stairs wherever possible, as these often cause continuing  
management problems. New external stairs may be added in some  
cases to achieve the objective of a separate direct entrance for each  
dwelling.  
# 7.3 Building Regulations  
Creating new dwellings constitutes building work and is controlled  
by the Building Regulations. Most of the same parts \(see Table  
IV\) apply to conversions as to new build. The main exception is  
*Approved Document L*. In recognition of the fact that it may not  
be reasonably possible to add thermal insulation to all elements of  
the existing fabric to the standards required for new buildings, con-  
versions must meet the requirements of *Approved Document L1B*,  
which applies only to existing buildings.  
Some elements such as top floor ceilings, though, are quite  
simple to insulate, and could be upgraded to a higher level  
than required for new build to compensate for not insulating  
the walls. Thermal insulation can also often be added to the  
walls of rear extensions, where there is a greater proportion  
of exposed wall surface to floor area, and decorative features,  
which would be lost, are absent. The replanning of rear parts of  
the house to provide new service rooms may also give opportu-  
nities to add insulating linings. Also worth considering \(subject  
to planning restrictions\) is external insulation, as this can the-  
oretically give a better thermal performance and reduces cold  
bridging. *Approved Document B1* and *Approved Document E*  
apply to conversions as for new build, and can impose signifi-  
cant requirements.  
# 7.4 Loft conversions  
If habitable rooms are converted out of loft space, the resulting  
floor area is measured over those parts that are more than 1.5 m  
high. A two-storey house is covered by *Approved Document B1*  
only for escape from upper-floor windows. However, when its loft  
is converted, extra requirements of *Approved Document B1* come  
into force.  
Under *Approved Document K*, alternating tread stairs are specif-  
ically allowed up to single rooms and bathrooms in a loft. Despite  
this, there are considerable reservations about the safety of alternat-  
ing tread stairs, and they are not recommended, especially in social  
housing. A reasonable width for a staircase leading to a single hab-  
itable room in a loft is 800 mm, with a minimum of 700 mm.  
# 7.5 External areas  
Similar considerations apply as to purpose-built flats. The best  
answer is often the simplest – to give both front and rear gardens to  
the lowest dwelling, which is likely to be the largest. Balconies to  
upper-floor units are less likely to be feasible than with new build,  
unless a low rear extension provides an opportunity for a roof ter-  
race. Some planning authorities discourage these as prejudicing  
the privacy of neighbouring gardens. In cases of detached, semi-  
detached and end-of-terrace properties with easy access to the rear,  
plots for the upper flats can be provided by dividing the rear gar-  
den. There are also examples where first floor flats have been given  
access by means of external stairs. There is, however, evidence that  
small, subdivided rear gardens can lead to neglect, because resi-  
dents feel less well ‘connected’ to them. **22-24** **Houses and flats**  
# 7.6 Office to residential  
In a drive to increase the delivery of new homes, the government  
relaxed the planning policy for conversion of office buildings into  
residential dwellings – which are now classified as permitted devel-  
opment obviating the need for planning approval. However, this  
has led to many unsatisfactory conversions, mainly undersized,  
studio and one-bedroom flats. Homes built under permitted devel-  
opment rules will now have to meet the Ndss and ensure adequate  
light. Nevertheless other issues remain, namely\: poor location; lack  
of private space; poor soundproofing and poor ventilation.  
# 8 ESTATE REGENERATION  
# 8.1 General  
LAs have recently built little new housing, but they still own an  
enormous stock of existing estates built over the last 100 years.  
Many of these are now decrepit and out of date. Regeneration of  
these estates can take many forms depending on the location of the  
estate, its age, its degree of dilapidation and the extent of home  
ownership present. Often, it is feasible to retain buildings which are  
serviceable or have satisfied residents, and remove those that are  
beyond their useful life to make way for new build interventions.  
# 8.2 Challenges  
Many flat blocks built before the First World War are characterised  
by sub-standard small floor areas, outdated internal planning with  
inadequate kitchens and bathrooms, and unsatisfactory means of  
escape. The building services are probably obsolete, and central  
heating and thermal insulation absent. Some of these blocks, how-  
ever, possess considerable architectural character, and have stable  
and supportive communities of residents.  
Blocks built between the wars may also be lacking in modern  
services, heating and insulation but can be better planned internally  
and well-built structurally. Kitchens are still usually too small for  
modern requirements although otherwise floor areas increased.  
External planning was simple, but with more communal space than  
is now desirable. Blocks from this period represent a vast invest-  
ment in housing stock, with enormous potential for improvement  
into good-quality modern housing and, on larger estates, the trans-  
formation of whole neighbourhoods.  
Since the Second World War, social housing has suffered from  
too many well-intentioned attempts to rethink design and planning  
from scratch. Consequently, the last 50 years have seen widely dif-  
fering forms of housing, many of which have proved dramatically  
unsuccessful. High-rise blocks of flats are only the most prominent  
and publicised of mistakes. Some of the medium-rise \(five or six  
storey\) deck access estates have proved even less satisfactory.  
Dwellings in these large, usually inner city estates generally  
complied with the good internal standards of Parker Morris. The  
problem is the external estate design, that is often hated and feared  
by the residents, which fails to provide private and public open  
spaces appropriate for families with children.  
# 8.3 Consultation  
Estate modernisation presents many varied, peculiar and acute prob-  
lems. First, an investigation to establish what the problems really are  
has to be carried out. These are rarely simple, and may vary widely  
from estate to estate. The people who understand the problems best  
are the residents, and careful approaches and techniques under the  
general description of community engagement should be adopted to  
identify and address the tenants’ concerns. There are many aspects  
that need consideration including tenure integration; extent of home  
ownership; size of dwellings; open space and amenity; community  
facilities; energy provision; and inclusive design.  
# 8.4 Proposals  
After this consultation, designs and proposals can be worked up  
in close collaboration with the residents. The works needed to  
improve estates will be different in each case; but may include  
some or all of the following\:  
• Moving family units down to ground level, perhaps by combining  
flats on ground and/or first floors into larger flats or maisonettes,  
and subdividing large flats on upper floors into small ones.  
• Using unwanted external space to provide private gardens for the  
ground floor units, with separate direct access from the public  
highway or estate road.  
• Remodelling the flat interiors, giving larger dining/kitchens and  
better bathrooms.  
• High-rise blocks that cannot be split up or effectively use entry  
phones can be provided with *concierge* systems; using a combina-  
tion of electronic and human portering to provide 24-hour security.  
• Improving refuse arrangements, aiming to disperse rather than  
concentrate collection points. Consideration should be given to  
an underground refuse storage system where the local authority  
can facilitate collection.  
• Improving the fabric; adding thermal and sound insulation; add-  
ing pitched roofs on top of flat roofs; replacing windows with  
double glazing and controllable trickle ventilation.  
• Renewing the mechanical and electrical services; adding cen-  
tral heating; improving ventilation by putting extract fans into  
kitchens and bathrooms. Where there is district heating with a  
central boiler house and a history of problems, replacing with  
unit systems in each dwelling. Consider heat-retrieval systems.  
• Consider converting some blocks to integrated sheltered hous-  
ing. In these cases, entrances and gardens must be clearly  
distinguished and separated.  
• Communal external spaces to be reduced to either a minimum  
or abolished.  
• If all family flats and maisonettes have their own private gar-  
dens, there is an argument that communal children’s play space  
within the estate may be unnecessary. If not, it must be carefully  
sited as it may cause nuisance to neighbouring dwellings. Play  
space in local parks is preferable if they are nearby; or situated  
in clearly public spaces such as the squares that might feature in  
some large estates. A lack of security is often perceived; ideally,  
family accommodation without sufficient, private, open space  
should be avoided.  
• Estate roads, car parking and emergency vehicle access often  
need to be replanned. Parking within the curtilage may be pos-  
sible if the front gardens are deep enough; otherwise provide  
small parking bays in clear view of the dwellings they serve.  
Basement parking and car courts at the rear of blocks are best  
avoided because of the security risks they pose.  
• Replan pedestrian routes in order to eliminate unnecessary foot-  
paths and to maximise natural supervision from the dwellings  
of all routes.  
• Adding lifts if over three storeys high.  
• Consider enclosing open balconies and staircases, and splitting  
up long balcony access buildings into smaller more manageable  
blocks, preferably with no more than 10 or 12 flats in each.  
• Adding entry phones to privatise staircases.  
# 9 CASE STUDY – CHOBHAM MANOR,  
# STRATFORD, LONDON. PRP ARCHITECTS  
# LLP \(WITH MAKE\)  
# 9.1 Introduction  
Chobham Manor is located in the first of the Olympic legacy  
neighbourhoods with the Olympic velodrome as a backdrop. The  
aspiration for the masterplan was to create a medium density com-  
munity which takes the best aspects of traditional London living  
to form a model for future cohesive and inclusive communities.  
Three-quarters of the 850 new homes are for families, provided  
in a range of typologies that cater for different lifestyles includ-  
ing multi-generation homes. Alongside the new homes, Chobham Manor also provides new shops, community facilities and 1,500 m2  
of publicly accessible open space.  
# 9.2 Site  
The wider site comprises 64 hectares \(ha\) of the Queen Elizabeth  
Olympic Park in East London, Figure 22.30. Outline planning per-  
mission was granted in 2012 for a phased, mixed-use development.  
The scheme is a long-term regeneration project, which is being  
developed over a period of 20 years.  
**Houses and flats** **22-25**  
Chobham Manor comprises approximately 13.5 ha of land  
with a varied history including uses as a manor house and farm-  
land, railway sidings and industry and most recently, as the  
location for the Olympic basketball arena. The velodrome and  
velopark are to the north of the site, with parkland to the west.  
Temple Mill Lane forms part of the eastern boundary, beyond  
which is Chobham Academy school. To the south is the East  
Village \(the former Athletes’ Village\) and the wider Stratford  
City development.  
**22.30** *Site plan*  
# 9.3 Masterplan  
Structured around the principles of community interaction, the  
masterplan allows residents to identify with their locality, their  
green open spaces and the streets on which they live, instilling a  
strong sense of ownership and community empowerment.  
The form of the masterplan generates a strong design identity  
that blends the boundaries to connect with adjacent communities.  
It continues the street grid of the East Village and establishes a  
robust urban grain that mediates between the higher densities of  
East Village and Stratford, and the lower densities of Leyton and  
Hackney Wick. An emphasis on the spaces between buildings is  
one of the key principles of the masterplan, with each street and  
space designed to have a distinct yet complementary character,  
Figure 22.31. Three linear, linked greens thread through the cen-  
tre and are the location for play, social interaction for all ages  
and gardens. These create an informal east – west route between  
Leyton and the North Park and form a strong sense of landscape  
identity through the masterplan. The urban blocks create strong  
frontages overlooking the public realm and secure rear gardens  
and courts \(with some above podium parking\). Mews streets are  
incorporated within the middle of some blocks, providing diver-  
sity with shared surfaces that generate a quieter, more intimate  
environment. Movement and permeability through the site is  
shown in Figure 22.32.  
**22.31** *Masterplan. a\) An ‘Everyone lives by the green’ design philosophy is used to instil community interaction and ownership by the*

# 9.4 Community engagement  
Significant public consultation took place with the local com-  
munity and stakeholders at every stage of the development. The  
first stage of public engagement comprised three consultation  
events in the local community, displaying outline proposals and  
seeking feedback on public open space. Attendees were given  
the opportunity to suggest ideas for the public open spaces  
within the site. These ideas were used to help devise the detailed  
proposals for the open spaces and play areas. There was a gen-  
eral appreciation of the ‘London Squares’ concept planned for  
Chobham Manor and of the approach to the management and  
maintenance of them.  
# 9.5 High sustainability standards  
Chobham Manor was designed to meet high standards of envi-  
ronmental performance with a focus on a ‘fabric first’ approach  
to the specification. This was established at a very early stage and  
regularly reviewed through the detailed design and construction  
stages. The aspiration for zero carbon was backed up by building  
performance modelling including a detailed review of the fab-  
ric specifications, and the modelling of thermal bridging. Close  
collaboration between the architects, consultants and an in-house  
team of sustainability and energy specialists facilitated an inte-  
grated and multidisciplinary approach to design development and  
delivery.  
# 9.6 Typologies  
Five principal housing typologies enable diversity and choice  
across the masterplan, comprising apartments, maisonettes, mul-  
ti-generational homes, mews and townhouses, Figure 22.33.  
Apartments are contained within the taller mansion blocks, pro-  
viding a transition in height from the adjoining site, while the corner  
blocks are four-storey apartment buildings, with some commercial  
use on the ground floor, Figures 22.34–22.36. The ‘Veloblock’,  
opposite the velodrome, has a retail space on the ground floor with a  
‘spill-out’ area in front of the building, complementing the facilities  
offered by the velodrome. Duplex apartments occupy the intermedi-  
ate floors and penthouses. All have a view of the velodrome and are  
dual aspect with multiple balconies and roof terraces. The ‘Multi-  
generation House’, is a typology created especially for Chobham  
Manor. It provides a flexible home for extended families who want  
to live together, while retaining a degree of mutual independence,  
Figure 22.21. The mews houses include an open-plan living/kitchen/  
dining area with access to a courtyard garden, three bedrooms, a  
large terrace on the first floor, and on-plot parking. The ‘House on the  
Green’ is a four-storey town house with its primary entrance on the  
green and a secondary entrance off the mews. It offers generous fam-  
ily accommodation with five bedrooms, on-plot parking, a sun deck  
and a roof terrace, Figure 22.18. The articulation of these houses  
takes cues from historical London precedents, providing inspiration  
for the contemporary façades fronting the greens. **Houses and flats** **22-27**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
Meeting the needs of our ageing society requires a number of dif-  
ferent housing solutions. The age 65+ population is increasing and  
this will require appropriately designed housing that can adapt to  
changing needs. Most people prefer to remain in their own homes  
and if their health deteriorates receive home care. However, a pro-  
portion of the population actively seeks or requires specialist older  
people’s housing. Individuals may wish to downsize or move if  
their accommodation is inaccessible, or may require the security of  
staff, or the care offered in a care home.  
The continuum of care diagram \(Figure 23.1\) illustrates the  
variety of older people’s housing with general needs housing at the  
lowest level and care homes for those with dementia at the highest  
level. Differing housing typologies sit between these limits. A num-  
ber of names are given to similar typologies, so for the purposes  
of this chapter retirement housing \(similar to sheltered housing and  
independent living\) and extra care housing \(similar to assisted liv-  
ing, very sheltered and housing with care\) will be referenced.  
An increasing demand for specialist older people’s housing is  
a reflection of people living longer due to a better environment  
and healthcare. Retirement and extra care housing promotes a res-  
ident’s independence, increasingly a lifestyle choice, whilst care  
homes provide security and support to the most vulnerable in our  
society.  
# 2 RETIREMENT AND EXTRA CARE HOUSING  
# 2.1 Overview  
The main housing typologies for older people are retirement and  
extra care. Both offer independent flats, specifically designed for  
older people, which can be adapted to meet residents’ changing  
needs providing as far as possible a home for life. Buildings should  
deliver an enabling environment incorporating dementia friendly  
design principles. Technology plays an important role in maintain-  
ing the independence and security of residents.  
Retirement housing has limited communal facilities and may  
have concierge type support. Extra care housing has additional  
communal facilities and access to 24-hour care and support.  
Since extra care housing has an onsite housing management and  
care service, a minimum of 50 units is desirable in each scheme  
to ensure viability. Communal spaces provided in an extra care  
scheme are dependent on size, viability, proximity of neighbouring  
facilities and whether the development provides outreach services,  
intermediate \(recuperative\) care, community hub or coffee shop,  
hairdresser, and so forth open to the public.  
The planning use class varies between local authorities \(either  
C2 or C3\) and should be resolved early on. There is often confusion  
regarding car parking and access requirements. Typically, less car  
parking is required than for general needs, and provision is made  
for emergency vehicle access \(including ambulances\), a drop-off  
area and parking for a mini-bus. Planning applications often require  
a transport statement/travel plan.  
# 2.2 Standards  
The Building Regulations and the National Technical Standards  
do not define older people’s housing. Dwellings designed for  
older people are an enhancement of the requirements set out in  
the Building Regulations Approved Document M4 \(Cat2\). This  
enhancement allows adequate space for carers and any future adap-  
tions without the space and cost implications of full M4 \(Cat3\)  
wheelchair access. In addition, a number of dwellings for wheel-  
chair users are sometimes provided in each new development  
and meet the requirements set out in the Building Regulations  
Approved Document M4 \(Cat3\).  
Current aspirations are outlined in the HAPPI report by Homes  
and Communities Agency 2009 \(not prescriptive design standards\).  
In addition, wide ranging information can be found at the Housing  
LIN website and design guides listed in the bibliography at the end  
of this chapter.  
Retirement and extra care accommodation is outlined in Table I.  
# 2.3 Designing for impairments  
The accommodation should be ‘enabling’ in terms of the likely  
impairments \(physical, visual, audio and cognitive\) that residents  
may experience with increasing age and frailty. Recommendations  
include\:  
• All dwellings and communal areas should comply with acces-  
sibility standards set out in the Building Regulations Approved  
Document M4, which includes bathroom/WC layouts, heights of  
controls, taps/ironmongery, etc.  
• Level access throughout including out to terraces, balconies, etc.  
• Automatic opening doors in key locations.  
• Structure should be strong enough for ceiling mounted hoists.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-26 **23-1** **23-2 Housing for older people**  
• ‘Free-swing’ door closers, linked to the fire alarm, should be  
fitted to doors regularly used by residents where closers are  
required. Fire compartment doors should be held open on mag-  
netic pads or hold open type door closers linked to the fire alarm.  
This will avoid the hazard and frustration associated with heavy  
overhead door closers.  
• Handrails to circulation routes should be returned to the wall to  
avoid snagging of clothing.  
• Internal ramps should be avoided.  
• Outward opening en-suite doors to facilitate rescue in the event  
of a fall.  
• Views out from dwellings and communal spaces from seated and  
standing positions.  
• For design solutions for the visually impaired, reference should  
be made to Building Sight by the Royal National Institute for  
the Blind.  
• There should be a light reflectance value contrast of at least 30  
points between the floor, walls, ceiling, fixtures and fittings.  
• Avoid glossy, shiny and highly patterned surfaces that can be  
confusing to those with visual impairment or dementia. Avoid  
changes in colour of floor finishes or contrasting threshold strips  
because they can appear as a step or barrier. Do not use dark or  
black flooring to lifts as this can appear as a void.  
• Consider enhanced acoustic separation \(TV high volume\).  
• Installation of an induction loop system to communal rooms and  
reception areas.  
• Incorporate dementia friendly design principles through-  
out. Guidance can be found in a series of publications by the  
Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of  
Stirling.  
• For a ‘visually accessible’ environment, provide views from cir-  
culation to the outside and into communal spaces. Provide views  
out and possibly a seating bay at the end of corridors.  
• Older people are potentially at a greater risk of falling. Therefore,  
tamper proof window restrictors may be required. In addition,  
it is recommended that balustrading to all communal external  
spaces used by residents with dementia should be a minimum of  
1800 mm high. Ensure that any communal balconies are suffi-  
ciently deep to avoid 1800 mm high balustrading becoming too  
oppressive.  
• Barrier type entrance matting rather than coir type.  
# 2.4 Building layout  
The building should have a logical layout that can be easily  
understood with clear views through including atria. ‘Progressive  
privacy’ describes the zoning of access allowed to residents, visi-  
tors and the general public. Circulation spaces should be more open  
and attractive than typical in general needs.  
Relationship diagram Figure 23.2 illustrates how spaces within  
these buildings are interrelated. For a good example of an extra  
care housing scheme, refer to Figure 23.3.  
# 2.5 Dwellings  
The orientation of dwellings is fundamental since all habitable  
rooms should enjoy a sunny aspect for part of the day. Halls, stores  
and en-suite wet rooms should be generous for accessibility and

planned to allow for future fitting of grab rails etc. The kitchen  
should be provided with a window even if facing common circu-  
lation. Ideally, all dwellings should benefit from a private external  
space. This external space may be provided by patios or balconies.  
Inset balconies \(Figure 23.4\) are preferred since they offer privacy  
and shelter. Glazed winter gardens \(Figure 23.5\) are particularly  
appropriate for older people, sheltering the external space from  
wind, rain and noise.  
External deck access \(Figure 23.6\) is becoming more popular  
to allow dual aspect dwellings and contact with garden spaces.  
The deck must be slip resistant and sheltered from the elements.  
For dual aspect dwellings two directions of escape avoid fire con-  
straints \(Ref. BS9991\). If escape is in one direction only, windows  
facing onto the deck will need to be fixed shut and fitted with fire  
insulating glazing since older people cannot be expected to crawl  
beneath windows to escape.  
Within corridors or deck access, entrances to flats should be  
celebrated as the threshold of the resident’s private domain by  
recessing, the use of colour/texture, and provision for personalisa-  
tion e.g. display shelf.  
For typical dwelling plans refer to Figures 23.7 and 23.8.  
care home is commonly regarded as a cost-effective size. There  
are two differing typologies for care homes, the ‘hotel’ and the  
‘cluster’.  
The ‘hotel’ typology provides communal accommodation close  
to the main entrance with bedrooms arranged along corridors.  
There is a central staff office for the whole building. Staff are called  
on pagers to give care or support to residents in any of the build-  
ing’s bedrooms/care suites.  
The ‘cluster’ typology divides the building into units each with  
its own domestic scale communal facilities. Clusters vary in size  
from 15–20 bedrooms for care homes and care homes with nurs-  
ing and 8–10 bedrooms for dementia care. \(To achieve the Stirling  
dementia gold standard, no more than 10 bedrooms are allowed  
per cluster.\)  
The planning use class is C2 institutional. Residents have no  
tenancy agreement but pay a monthly cost for housing and care  
provision. The transport and parking needs of residents, staff and  
visitors must be properly met. Planning applications may require a  
transport statement/travel plan. The ‘cluster’ typology is covered  
here.

Care homes provide 24-hour care for residents in bedroom  
accommodation with en-suite shower/WC facilities. A 60-bed

Care home design is required to meet the standards outlined in  
*Care homes for older people, national minimum standards, care*  
*homes regulations*, 3rd edition, 2006. The standards outline a  
number of requirements including that bedrooms must provide a  
minimum 12 m2 usable floor space excluding the en-suite area. This **23-4 Housing for older people**

is exceeded to varying degrees by operators depending on their par-  
ticular market. Hotel-style care homes may have care suites with  
multiple rooms.  
Care home ‘cluster’ accommodation is outlined in Table II.  
# 3.3 Designing for impairments  
Refer also to Section 2.3 Designing for impairments. There are a  
few additional recommendations relevant to care homes\:  
• Bedrooms to have views out from a seated position in the bed.  
• Consider acoustic separation, since excluded from the Part B  
Building Regulations definition ‘rooms for residential purposes’.  
• Dementia care kitchen serveries should look into a room rather  
than towards a wall, i.e. open plan ‘L’ shaped with an island unit.  
• One-and-a-half door leaves to improve accessibility.  
• Flush jointing strips between floor finishes to aid walking frames.  
# 3.4 Building layout  
The building should be welcoming, light and airy. Spaces must be  
visually connected to promote ease of use. The reception desk must  
be visible on entering the care home. **Accommodation – for approximately 4–5 clusters \(60–70 bedrooms\)**  
Care home/care home with nursing, clusters 15 to 20 bedrooms with en-suite facilities.  
Dementia care clusters 8 to 10 bedrooms with en-suite facilities.

Relationship diagrams Figures 23.9 and 23.10 illustrate how  
spaces within the buildings are interrelated. For a good example of  
a care home, refer to Figure 23.11.  
# 3.5 Bedrooms  
It is good practice to ensure two alternative locations can be  
provided for the bed in the bedroom. Wireless nursing staff com-  
munication systems allow the bedhead position to be easily moved.  
One location should allow staff to view the bed from the doorway,  
the alternative location can be positioned to provide greater pri-  
vacy. Ensure that the toilet can be made visible from one of the  
bed positions for residents who require this prompt. As a mini-  
mum, the bedroom furniture must include a bed, bedside table, two  
# Housing for older people 23-7  
comfortable seats, a table and clothes storage. \(Kitchenette provi-  
sion offered in care suites.\)  
For typical standard and specialised bedroom plans, refer to  
Figures 23.12 and 23.13.  
# 4 INTERIOR AND LANDSCAPE  
# 4.1 Interior design  
Well-designed interiors can dramatically influence the overall suc-  
cess of a development. Furniture, fixtures and equipment should  
have a domestic, non-institutional appearance with rounded edges  
and comply with Fire Safety Regulations. Within communal areas,  
there should be a choice of seating to suit residents’ mobility needs.  
Chairs should be fitted with arm rests. Sofas must have legs \(rather  
than solid construction below seat height\) to allow a seated occu-  
pant to position their feet slightly back before standing. Consider  
providing some chairs to suit bariatric residents. Appropriate fab-  
rics that are impervious, antibacterial and flame-retardant should  
be specified.  
Communal areas must be well lit with appropriate fittings and  
good controls. Provide directional or task lighting in offices and  
activity rooms. Kitchens should have pelmet lighting above the  
worktops. Locate plug sockets where extra directional light sources  
are required to avoid unnecessary flexes, which are a safety hazard.  
External lighting should enhance outside space particularly when  
viewed from resident accommodation and communal areas.  
Only provide internal signs where absolutely necessary.  
Symbols and lettering should be clear, visible \(in a relatively large  
font\) and contrast with the background. The choice of signs should  
be domestic and be considered as a key element of the interior  
design package.  
# 4.2 Landscape design  
Buildings should create and define external spaces with the best  
possible outlook. The landscaped, wheelchair accessible garden  
should be an extension of internal communal spaces. It is important  
that the garden is secure and safe. All schemes should include a  
sunny terrace with a shaded area adjacent to the building to allow  
residents to sit outdoors on warm days.  
Walking routes should be as level as possible making use of  
any features and views with adequate seats for resting. The gar-  
dens should surprise and delight through sound, smell and touch as  
well as the visual senses. Areas should be identified for bird feeders  
or nest boxes. Planting should be selected that encourages butter-  
flies and other insects to enhance the biodiversity of the garden.  
Consider the inclusion of a small ‘kitchen garden’ area or a few  
fruit trees so the garden can be productive.  
Consider incorporating raised planters as a means of bring-  
ing plants closer to residents and enabling them to participate  
in gardening from a wheelchair or a standing position. Provide  
external taps for garden watering purposes. Select trees and  
plants that provide year-round colour. Do not specify poisonous  
or thorny/spiky plants. Roof gardens, see Figure 23.14, may be  
appropriate to supplement a ground level garden, accessible by  
lift and ideally associated with other communal facilities \(e.g. an  
activity room\).  
# 5 FIRE  
# 5.1 Overview  
The level of fire precautions provided within older people’s housing  
should be determined following a client risk assessment \(own-  
er’s obligations under the Regulatory Reform \(Fire Safety\) Order  
2005\), of the needs of the residents, alongside complying with  
the requirements of the Building Regulations. This should ensure  
that the management regime \(led by the ‘Responsible Person’\) is  
accommodated by the building design, which may result in the **23-8 Housing for older people**

requirements of Part B being exceeded, including fire-engineered  
solutions \(e.g. sprinklers\).  
Liaison between client, fire consultant and the design team at  
early design stage on the risk assessments and safety strategy is  
essential.  
As this edition of *Metric Handbook* went to press, a review into  
Fire Safety Regulations in care homes and specialist buildings was  
underway. Carried out by PRP Architects, this includes an assess-  
ment of evaluation strategies and is likely to inform future policy  
decisions.  
# 5.2 Fire\: retirement and extra care housing

B Vol. 1 purpose group 1\(a\) flat\) and therefore typically operates a  
stay put fire strategy.  
Fire precautions and means of escape for extra care flats may  
include the following additional design measures\:  
• Alarm system with both audible and visual signals to alert those  
who are hard of hearing or have visual impairment.  
• Mobility scooters must not be parked or charged in communal  
corridors. It is essential that mobility scooters are parked in des-  
ignated stores with a fire-resisting enclosure.  
• Stairs and corridors to provide refuge areas as future-proofing.  
• It is not realistic to expect frail older residents to use egress win-  
dows or crawl below 1100 mm.  
• The fire alarm system is to be linked to the warden call and staff  
handsets to allow swift reset.  
• Where older people are incapable of independent evacuation, a  
fire-protected area \(e.g. cross-corridor door\) should be accessible  
within 7.5 m to provide a short distance to a place of relative safety.  
• Alarms on final exits to alert staff that external doors are open.  
# 5.3 Fire\: care homes, care homes with nursing and  
# dementia care  
The accommodation consists of bedrooms \(AD Part B Vol. 2 pur-  
pose group 2\(a\) residential institutional\) and therefore typically  
operates a progressive horizontal escape strategy from bedrooms to  
sub-compartments with two alternatives per compartment.  
Fire precautions and means of escape for care homes may  
include the following additional design measures\:  
• Avoid dead ends. A fire-engineered smoke extract system may  
allow an increase to escape distances.  
• Maximum size of sub-compartment dependent on minimum  
time for staff to evacuate residents. Sprinklers will increase flex-  
ibility.  
• Stairs sufficiently sized to provide a refuge.  
• Evacuation lifts where the strategy requires.  
# 6 ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES  
# 6.1 Assistive technologies\: dwellings  
An assistive technology Telecare hub is fitted in the resident’s  
main living room, which as a minimum is hard wired to the  
dwelling’s shower room emergency pull cord. If an alarm call is  
made, the system notifies onsite or offsite care staff. Additional  
devices can be added to the system \(connected by Wi-Fi\) to suit  
the requirements of the individual resident. Telecare devices can  
automatically and remotely monitor residents to manage the risks  
associated with living alone. Telecare safety devices include the  
following\:  
• Environmental sensors which can detect flooding/gas and  
changes in temperature.  
• Motion sensors that can monitor the lifestyle of a resident with  
bed occupancy, fall, door and movement detectors.  
• Tracking sensors which are sometimes used if people have  
dementia.  
In addition to Telecare, the introduction of Telehealth may be  
considered suitable for some residents. Telehealth can assist in the  
management of long-term health conditions by monitoring blood  
pressure, blood glucose levels or weight. Patients undertake the  
tests themselves in the home environment with the results auto-  
matically transmitted to a health professional for evaluation and  
appropriate action. **6.2 Assistive technologies\: care homes**  
Assistive technology wireless nurse communication system points  
are positioned in residents’ bedrooms and communal areas. If the  
system is pressed for attention, the system will contact staff, often  
by a site-wide paging system, who can then visit the location of the  
call. Wireless rolling displays can also inform staff of alarm calls  
rather than pagers. Telecare devices can be added to the system to  
tailor the technology to individual residents.  
# 7 ENVIRONMENT  
# 7.1 Sustainable design  
Older people’s housing should have high levels of insulation to  
ensure good thermal comfort for residents and reduce heating costs.  
Furthermore, these managed buildings provide opportunities for  
the use of renewable energy systems.  
Overheating can be a problem. Older people are at an increased  
risk of heat-related illness if their health is already compromised. A  
fabric-first approach to overheating should be adopted, by providing  
suitable thermal mass; dual aspect dwellings where possible; shad-  
ing; efficient light fittings/equipment; appropriate window sizes/  
secure night venting; and correct building orientation. However,  
a natural ventilation system may be insufficient to reduce temper-  
atures to an acceptable level for frail older people. Providing air  
conditioning to one of the communal spaces should be considered  
to provide a respite area for residents during a heat wave. Dynamic  
thermal 3D modelling should be used to test the design.  
Older people tend to spend long periods of time at home, which when  
combined with frail health may lead to higher risks from poor air quality.  
Air quality should be considered when selecting a site. Building design,  
including the location of windows, ventilation intakes and exhausts in  
relation to external sources of air pollution should be carefully planned.  
Materials used for the internal finishes should be selected to avoid sub-  
stances such as formaldehyde or other volatile organic compounds.  
Access to adequate levels of daylight and sunlight is of particu-  
lar importance to older people due to the prevalence of sight loss  
and the health benefits of sunlight. Windows to habitable rooms  
must be adequately sized and orientated. A daylight and sunlight  
assessment should be undertaken for cases where the site has been  
identified to be at risk of reduced access to daylight and sunlight.  
Older people often have significant hearing impairments. The  
ability to understand a normal conversation can be further reduced  
by high levels of background noise. Sites for older people’s accom-  
modation should be selected, where possible, away from major  
roads and other sources of high external noise. Internally, enhanced  
sound insulation should help reduce noise transmission and rever-  
beration between residents.  
# 7.2 Services  
Simplicity of all controls and operation is essential.  
Older people may have limited mobility and reduced heat  
sensitivity placing them at greater risk of injury from hot water  
or heating systems. Thermostatic blending valve controls must  
ensure that hot water is less than 44°C at outlets in accommodation  
accessed by this group. Towel rails should be specified with a low  
surface temperature of a maximum of 43°C.  
Under-floor heating should be specified to avoid dangers from  
hot surfaces and to provide unrestricted wall space. During the  
winter months, heating controls can be set to provide a minimum  
temperature within dwellings. This protects vulnerable people from  
cold weather. Cold weather is associated with an increase in deaths  
and in addition has significant impact on morbidity. Gas services  
within apartments are to be avoided.  
# 8 LIFETIME/CONTINUING CARE  
# NEIGHBOURHOODS  
There has been a shift in the provision of older people’s housing  
away from institutional settings to more independent typologies  
# Housing for older people 23-11  
and care in the home. This shift is motivated by aspirations and  
costs.  
The location of housing for older people is very important. Ideally,  
new developments should be sited in the heart of an existing commu-  
nity or act as a hub, with generous communal facilities, open to the  
surrounding neighbourhood. Older people value the social cohesion  
and intergenerational contact offered by the wider community.  
Promoting a united approach to housing, health and adult ser-  
vices for older people has become an important focus. Continuing  
care neighbourhoods, providing integrated services for older  
people, requires strategic planning by local authorities, health  
authorities and public/private developers.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Scope  
This chapter deals with the design of accommodation for students,  
but is also relevant to accommodation that is occupied for a lim-  
ited period by other groups of independent, single people, such as  
‘spring-board’ accommodation for young professionals. The term  
‘university’ is used to refer to Higher Education Establishments  
\(HEEs\), Further Education Establishments \(FEEs\), colleges and  
other similar institutions.  
Please note that plans used to illustrate this chapter are of built  
projects, and that there may have been changes to standards and  
legislation since they were completed. They are therefore illustra-  
tive only.  
At the time of updating in early 2021, it is anticipated that  
Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on the way in which students  
learn, potentially involving a greater degree of home study and/or  
remote learning. Brexit may also lead to changes in the university  
sector that influence the design and provision of student accom-  
modation.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-27  
The chapter provides a sound starting point, but detailed  
requirements should be reviewed with the university client and/or  
private provider client.  
# 1.2 Importance  
In recent years, legislative and economic change has had a signifi-  
cant effect on students and the provision of student accommodation.  
Government policy has led to a considerable expansion in student  
numbers, while the impact of the sharp rise in student fees has  
resulted in students becoming increasingly discerning. Availability,  
variety and quality of accommodation are important factors when  
choosing a university. There is more competition between univer-  
sities to attract good students and so the universities – and also  
private commercial providers of accommodation – are increasingly  
concerned with the ‘student experience’ that they offer. As costs  
increase, the views of parents on standards of accommodation have  
also become more important. It is, however, important to note that  
due to an increase in both tuition fees and accommodation costs,  
affordability is increasingly gaining in importance.  
# 1.3 Ownership  
Student accommodation is owned and managed in a variety of ways,  
which can have significant implications for design. Universities  
provide communal rented accommodation on or off campus, which  
they own and/or manage. The recent growth in private sector com-  
mercial operators building and managing accommodation has  
continued to such an extent that the NUS/Unipol Accommodation  
Costs Survey 2018 notes that the split in ‘purpose built student  
accommodation’ between the private sector and educational insti-  
tutions in now 50\:50. Additional growth is predicted in the private  
sector in the future when compared to educational establishments.  
Large developments are more economic to build and run, so recent  
schemes often accommodate 400 to 1000 students or more. Private  
developments are often pre-let to a university and may be designed  
and managed in liaison with the university. Meanwhile, a large  
proportion of students still live in individual shared houses or flats  
within the community, while many others live at home.  
# 1.4 Rents  
The government does not fund student accommodation and  
schemes are normally self-funding through the rental income that  
is charged for the rooms. Project budgets are therefore determined  
by the level of rents that students can afford or are willing to pay,  
and this is directly reflected in the size of the study bedrooms and  
extent of other facilities provided in the scheme.  
Where accommodation is provided by a university, there is a  
concern to keep rents to affordable levels, although their offer usu-  
ally includes some choice of accommodation at different rents. The  
private market also offers a range of room types and rents, and there  
has been a marked increase in ‘luxury’ accommodation, targeted at  
those who can afford high rents, including a high proportion of  
international students. To illustrate the wide range of rents, the  
NUS/Unipol Accommodation Costs Survey 2018 reported a lowest  
rent of £65 per week \(40 week let\) for a room in an institutional  
**24-1** **24-2 Housing for students and young people**  
cluster \(Manchester\) and a highest cost of £535 per week \(51 week  
let\) for a private studio in Bloomsbury, London. With annual rents  
continuing to outstrip inflation, achieving affordability is a key  
challenge in the sector if stated aims of inclusivity, opportunity and  
diversity are to be achieved.  
# 1.5 Student experience  
Issues relating to social sustainability and the ‘student experience’  
have become increasingly critical, and are particularly challeng-  
ing in the design of larger, potentially impersonal, schemes,  
particularly where these are off campus. Where accommodation  
is designed for a university, there will generally be a concern to  
make the students feel part of the university community. \(This  
might be achieved through the design of the building, for exam-  
ple, by arranging buildings around a courtyard to provide a shared  
focus for the residents, or by placing social spaces such as com-  
mon rooms and kitchen/dining rooms on busy circulation routes  
to encourage interaction.\) Universities generally also have systems  
of pastoral care with wardens or senior students living among the  
students. With a private commercial provider, there is likely to be a  
different emphasis to the student experience as the provider has to  
attract the students and, in many instances, justify higher charges  
by providing extra facilities such as a gym or café and promoting a  
particular ‘lifestyle’ and branding through the design of the build-  
ing. The styling of these schemes often has the more commercial  
character of a modern hotel, rather than that of a university.  
The student experience has recently been brought into sharp  
focus with the Covid-19 pandemic, both in terms of the relative  
value of tuition fees and for the metal health and well-being of stu-  
dents. It is anticipated that the effects of the pandemic will influence  
the design brief of student housing, with the potential requirement  
for less dense developments, a more varied set of communal spaces  
for studying, socialising and relaxation, easy access to communal  
external space and provision for remote learning.  
# 1.6 Context  
Consideration should be given to the relationship of the accom-  
modation to the local community, particularly where it is located  
in a town rather than on campus. The design of the building and  
landscape can help to integrate the university and its students  
within the community, and it can also help to avoid potential con-  
flict. Students can cause nuisance to neighbours, particularly where  
there are large areas of student accommodation within one neigh-  
bourhood \(known as ‘studentification’\). Conversely, there can be  
risks to the students for personal safety and theft of property.  
# 1.7 Sustainability and climate emergency  
Sustainability is an important issue for universities as well as for  
many individual students. Following the UK government’s decla-  
ration of a climate emergency in May 2019, the NUS has created  
the charity Students Oganising for Sustainability – UK \(SOS-UK\).  
In parallel, the Climate Commission for UK Higher and Further  
Education has been established with the primary aim of drastically  
increasing the contribution of universities and colleges in the fight  
against climate change. By creating a Climate Framework, their  
aim is to guide and support all universities to be net zero carbon by  
2050 at the latest.  
Consideration should be given in the design of residences to all  
aspects of sustainability including reducing energy consumption,  
carbon emissions and the inclusion of renewable energy sources.  
Technologies and system efficiencies are constantly evolving. For  
example, the use of CHP \(Combined heat and power\) was well  
suited to this building type, but with the decarbonisation of the  
electricity grid it is now possible to use heat pumps \(air or ground  
source\) instead of CHP to further reduce carbon emissions and  
omit gas systems.  
Other issues include reducing water consumption, rainwater  
harvesting, the use of LED lighting and intelligent controls, waste  
and recycling facilities in both construction and use, sustainable  
urban drainage and sustainable transportation. Pre-fabrication,  
which is widely used for ensuite bathrooms in student accommo-  
dation, can also be used for the fabrication of structural frames and  
elevation panels, reducing waste while improving quality. Modular  
construction, where full rooms can be fitted-out in factory condi-  
tions and delivered to site, would also appear to be well matched  
to student housing.  
Provision for future flexibility should be incorporated into the  
design where possible, as requirements and aspirations change –  
examples in recent years include the impact of advances in computer  
technologies, the preference for ensuite bathrooms and improved  
standards for access for disabled people. Ultimately, there may even  
be a need to adapt accommodation to new uses if the demand for  
student residences reduces.  
# 1.8 Timing  
Projects will generally be programmed to complete construction in  
summer in time for occupation in a new academic year.  
# 2 STUDENTS  
# 2.1 Tenant range  
Conventionally, students are perceived as young, single, mobile,  
adaptable and with little money to spend. This is still true of many  
students – in particular an increasing number of students are strug-  
gling to afford the rents charged for accommodation. However,  
there is also a need to cater for a broader range of cultural and eco-  
nomic backgrounds, and for students with different needs\: disabled  
students, mature and married students, and those with families.  
There is also an increasing demand for single sex, quiet and alco-  
hol-free residences. Postgraduate students are older and require  
a quieter and more ‘adult’ living environment. Many universities  
have a significant number of students from overseas, including  
‘international students’ from outside the EU who pay higher fees  
and make a significant contribution to university income. Some  
students study part time, while many have to manage part-time jobs  
to support themselves through university. There is an increasing  
demand for convenience and flexibility in the way that services,  
including accommodation, are provided to them.  
# 2.2 Availability  
Universities rarely have accommodation for all of their students,  
and priority is usually given to first year students who need support  
to settle into the university community. Other groups, such as final  
year students sitting exams, and students from overseas, may also  
be offered priority. Some accommodation is rented only during  
term time, and is used for conference and holiday lets out of term,  
while other accommodation, including accommodation by private  
providers, is rented for the whole academic year. Average contract  
lets are 40 weeks for educational establishments and 46 weeks for  
private providers.  
# 2.3 Characteristics  
The characteristics which differentiate student accommodation  
from other housing and from hotel accommodation, and which  
should be addressed in design, are\:  
• An appropriate environment in which to study as well as to live,  
socialise and sleep, and a building in use 24 hours a day.  
• Creating a university community, with opportunities to form  
friendships and for informal academic and social interaction.  
• Privacy where people are living in close proximity and are shar-  
ing facilities – many students will not have the opportunity to  
choose their neighbours.  
• Design, including the selection of materials and fittings, must  
be appropriately robust for student use and easy to maintain –  
whole life costing is an important consideration. • Avoiding an unpleasant institutional character, which can eas-  
ily arise where large numbers of identical study bedrooms are  
arranged to maximise efficiency.  
• For many people student accommodation will be their first  
experience of living away from home. Well-designed student  
accommodation has the potential to broaden awareness of archi-  
tectural design and issues of sustainability.  
# 2.4 Priorities  
Student experience polls have revealed students’ priorities for  
accommodation\:  
• Availability of internet access in the study bedroom  
• Availability of cooking facilities  
• Security  
• Journey time and closeness to the university  
• Cost  
• Local amenities and communal facilities  
• Number of students in each flat  
• Provision of ensuite bathroom  
• ANUK accreditation \(see Section 5.2\)  
• On site amenities  
• Catering provided  
• Car parking  
• Room size  
• Noise  
• Clean facilities.  
# 3 TYPES OF ACCOMMODATION  
# 3.1 Brief  
When establishing the brief for accommodation, key items for dis-  
cussion are\:  
• The ‘style’ of the accommodation\: staircase, house, hall or flat  
• Number and mix of room types\: single, shared and studio  
• Number of students sharing each kitchen  
• Provision of ensuite bathrooms or shared bathrooms  
• Provision of other facilities\: common room, reception, gym,  
laundry etc.  
• Accessibility requirements \(university/ building regulations/  
local plan\)  
• Whether the facilities will be used for conferences or holiday  
letting out of term time  
• Client standards and requirements for specific products, e.g. a  
particular ensuite bathroom pod.  
# 3.2 Style of accommodation  
The vast majority of student accommodation is based on provision  
of an individual study bedroom for each student, although uni-  
versities and private providers are offering an increasing range of  
choice to suit different requirements and budgets, including study  
bedrooms shared by two students \(for lower rents\), ‘studio’ rooms  
with an en suite bathroom and a kitchen area, or larger studio flats  
for one person or a couple. There has been a significant growth  
in the number of studio rooms, generally in private developments,  
although supply of these now appears to be outstripping demand.  
There is a concern that the nature of self-containment provided in  
this room type can lead to a sense of isolation. Care must be taken  
to ensure that other means of social interaction are provided in  
order to encourage a sense of community \(see 3.3\). Studio rooms  
or flats are particularly suited to postgraduates and mature stu-  
dents who are more independent and are also appropriate for other  
young, single people outside the world of education – for example,  
young professionals or key workers. A proportion of rooms should  
be designed for wheelchair users, with numbers agreed with the  
local authority.  
# Housing for students and young people 24-3  
In schemes with individual study bedrooms, the style of the  
accommodation is largely determined by the way that study bed-  
rooms are grouped together to form a social unit, and the way that  
shared facilities \(kitchens, common rooms, etc.\) are provided. A  
university may instil a sense of responsibility and independence by  
placing small groups of students in separate shared flats, or it may  
exercise a greater degree of supervision and pastoral care through a  
communal hall arrangement, where typically several hundred stu-  
dents are accommodated in rooms off shared corridors.  
# 3.3 Number of students in each unit  
Forming good relationships is crucial to support students who are  
new to university and to reduce drop-out rates. The use of comput-  
ers and technology can result in students spending too much time  
alone in their rooms and becoming isolated, so student accommo-  
dation needs to be designed to encourage interaction. It is generally  
agreed that students form friendships more easily and are more  
likely to behave responsibly – reducing management and mainte-  
nance problems – if they are in smaller groups\: typically, five to ten  
students sharing a self-contained flat or house. However, in small  
groups, students who have not chosen to live together may not get  
on. Larger groups can provide a greater choice of friends, particu-  
larly when combined with a greater level of pastoral support from  
university staff\: in a traditional ‘hall’, the social unit is the whole  
hall, creating a stronger sense of engagement with the university  
itself.  
# 3.4 Shared facilities in each unit  
*Kitchens*  
Traditionally, central catering facilities were provided in larger  
halls of residence, with minimal facilities for cooking close to the  
study bedrooms. The intention was to encourage students to engage  
with the wider university community, and many universities still  
offer accommodation with central catering included as part of  
the rent. However, for reasons of economy, culture and conveni-  
ence, most students prefer the freedom of catering for themselves  
or of eating out. As a consequence, in most new accommodation  
– whether in the form of halls, flats or houses – kitchen-dining  
rooms are provided for self-catering, each serving a group of study  
bedrooms and effectively defining the social groups. The kitch-  
en-dining room may incorporate a ‘living room’ area with soft  
seating, and may also be used for informal study. As noted earlier,  
some schemes include studio rooms, where each student has their  
own kitchen facilities. In this situation, the provision of common  
facilities shared by all the residents is important to build a sense of  
community.  
*Bathrooms*  
The majority of new study bedrooms are now provided with ensuite  
bathrooms, usually as prefabricated pods, and where it is intended  
that the rooms will be used for conference accommodation out  
of term time, ensuite bathrooms are generally essential. In some  
schemes, a single ensuite bathroom is shared by two study bed-  
rooms. Schemes with ensuite bathrooms are not necessarily more  
expensive than those with shared bathrooms, particularly when  
washbasins are also provided in all of the study bedrooms as well.  
Costs will depend on the detailed arrangement of the plan and over-  
all floor areas as well as the number of sanitary fittings.  
*Other shared facilities*  
Common rooms, laundries, reception, shared study area or seminar  
rooms, staff/wardens’ flats, etc. will be provided where the student  
numbers are large enough to support them, where there is a demand  
associated with teaching or conference uses or, especially in the  
case of commercial providers, where the facilities are intended to  
attract a particular market. Facilities in commercial schemes can be  
extensive\: for example, a games room, gym, cinema or café. **24-4 Housing for students and young people**  
# 4 BUILDING FORM  
# 4.1 Study bedrooms  
Study bedrooms form the basic building block of student accom-  
modation and can be arranged in a number of ways. In each case,  
the study bedrooms may have ensuite bathrooms or there may be  
shared bathrooms.  
# 4.2 Staircase model  
In the traditional ‘Oxbridge’ model, buildings arranged around a  
quadrangle are divided into ‘staircases’ with a small number of  
study bedrooms at each level served by a single stair \(Figure 24.1\).  
A small kitchen may be provided on each floor or on one level,  
and is shared by the rooms on the staircase. A loose social group is  
defined by the staircase, but there is also a strong association with  
the wider college or university.  
However, it is difficult to incorporate lift access economically,  
as separate lifts are required for each staircase. An arrangement  
where lifts are not provided and wheelchair access is restricted to  
the ground floor level may not be acceptable to the university and  
may not be appropriate where conference use is proposed.  
# 4.3 House style  
This replicates the popular model of a traditional private house  
shared by students \(Figure 24.2\). It is similar to the staircase model  
with a limited number of study bedrooms on several levels served  
by a single stair, and a shared kitchen/dining room at ground level.

*floor plan, c\) isometric sectional view* Accessible rooms are also provided at ground floor level, but full  
accessibility is limited. The house has its own front door so that  
the social group is well defined and there is a greater sense of  
independence. However, the problems of incorporating lifts and  
providing access for disabled students or visitors to upper floors  
are the same as for the staircase model.  
# 4.4 Hall or corridor  
Rooms are arranged off a corridor \(Figures 24.3–24.5\). Corridor  
schemes allow for large numbers of rooms to be served economi-  
cally by lifts, providing disabled access as well as easy access for  
conference guests, cleaning staff and students with luggage. The  
hall itself forms a single large social group, but smaller units are  
less easy to form. The corridors may be divided along their length  
to form groups of rooms with a shared kitchen, but this cannot pro-  
vide the domestic character and scale of a shared flat or college  
staircase. In some schemes, corridors are doubled up to form sep-  
arate flats. Schemes which consist of studio rooms or studio flats  
are usually also arranged on corridors. Corridor access schemes  
tend to have a higher proportion of circulation area than staircase  
schemes. It is difficult to bring natural light and ventilation into  
double-loaded corridors, and their design requires careful handling  
to avoid monotony and a dull institutional character. They also pro-  
vide the unwelcome opportunity for a few un-neighbourly residents  
to disrupt all the others.  
# 4.5 Flats  
Rooms are grouped into self-contained flats with a number of  
study bedrooms \(typically five to eight\) and shared kitchen/din-  
ing room \(Figures 24.6 and 24.7\). This ‘cluster-flat’ arrangement  
is very common and defines a self-contained social group with its  
own front door. Lift access can be arranged economically to serve  
groups of flats.  
# 4.6 General design factors  
*Depth of plan*  
Student study bedrooms are usually small – typically 13 m2 for a  
room with ensuite bathroom – and the space is more useable if the  
room is rectangular. Placing the ensuite bathroom at the back of the  
room in the centre of the building produces a deeper building plan,  
particularly with a double-loaded corridor, and reduces the length  
# Housing for students and young people 24-5  
of corridor. It is therefore generally the most cost-effective layout.  
Providing bathrooms as shared facilities \(as opposed to ensuite\)  
will impact on corridor length and escape distances.  
*Escape distances*  
The escape distance from the farthest study bedroom to the escape  
stair is a key factor in the arrangement of the plan. Arranging  
narrow study bedrooms in a row allows the number of rooms  
served by each escape stair to be maximised. However, the width  
of the rooms must also be considered in relation to the use of  
space within the room. Escape distances are set out in Approved  
Document B of the UK Building Regulations and will vary  
dependent on the nature of the design and the number of available  
staircases.  
*Lifts*  
The requirement for inclusion and for access for wheelchair users to  
different parts of the building is discussed in Section 5.7. Provision  
of lift access to all floors and all study bedrooms will have impli-  
cations for the arrangement of the plan, as it is normal to aim to  
limit the number of lifts in a scheme to reduce cost. Fire-fighting  
lifts will be required above a certain height, in line with Approved  
Document B of the UK Building Regulations, and it is anticipated  
that evacuation lifts, to provide dignified emergency egress, will  
become more commonplace.  
*Modern Methods of Construction \(MMC\) and*  
*pre-fabrication*  
Study bedrooms are repetitive units and, where large numbers are  
involved, they lend themselves to MMC such as prefabricated  
structural elements, tunnel form or off-site modular and volumet-  
ric construction, although care is required to ensure that this does  
not produce a dull, institutional character in the internal layout or  
elevations of the building. Pre-fabrication is commonly used for  
ensuite bathroom pods and can be used for whole rooms. The sys-  
tem speeds up construction, reduces waste and allows complicated  
elements to be constructed to a high standard in factory conditions.  
However, there is usually a capital cost premium to be balanced  
against any savings from the reduced construction programme.  
Acoustic and fire separation between rooms needs to be carefully  
considered where modular elements are used as they are often

lightweight construction. The decision to use modular construction  
needs to be taken at an early stage in the design process as there are  
implications for dimensions \(both plan and section\) and interfaces  
with surrounding elements and for the procurement route.  
*Maintenance and management*  
The university or private provider will have arrangements for  
maintenance and management of the accommodation and possibly  
preferences for specification that will impact on the design. These  
need to be accommodated while still achieving an attractive and  
welcoming design for the residents.  
# 5 STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS  
This section gives guidance on key areas of legislation, but is  
not intended to be comprehensive. The standards and legislation  
referred to are current at January 2021. Designers should check that  
these have not been superseded.  
Designs should comply with all statutory requirements contained  
within Housing, Building, Planning, Disability Discrimination Act  
\(N. Ireland only\) Equality and other relevant legislation and standards.  
# 5.1 Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and  
# amendments\: planning permission  
Student accommodation falls into different use classes under the  
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 \(as amended\). This depends  
on size and whether \(and also how\) it is provided by a university/  
college or by a private provider. Under the Use Class Order 1987  
\(as amended\), student accommodation mainly falls within Use  
Class C2 \(Residential Institutions\), Use Class C4 \(small houses in  
multiple occupation \(HMOs\) of three to six residents\) or sui gen-  
eris \(‘of their own kind’\). Student accommodation may also fall  
within Use Class C3 if the dwelling is occupied by a single person  
or people who form a single household.  
*Developments by Higher Education Establishments*  
Student accommodation for residential universities and colleges  
will generally fall into Use Class C2. However, accommodation  
that is remote from the campus may be classed as sui generis, or  
Class C4 or Class C3, as for accommodation by private providers –  
see next subsection.  
*Developments by private providers*  
HMOS\: LARGER PROPERTIES \(OVER SIX OCCUPANTS\)  
Larger HMOs with more than six tenants and large purpose-built  
accommodation units are unclassified by the Use Classes Order and  
are described as sui generis. Discussion with the planning authority  
will be required to clarify their requirements.  
HMOS\: SMALL PROPERTIES S \(THREE TO SIX OCCUPANTS\)  
Use Class C4 HMOs covers small shared houses or flats occupied  
by three to six tenants who are not related to each other and who  
share one or more basic amenities \(such as a kitchen or bathroom\).  
STUDENT ACCOMMODATION FALLING WITHIN USE CLASS C3  
\(DWELLING HOUSES\)  
Student accommodation may fall within Use Class C3 if the  
dwelling/flat is occupied by one person or people who form a sin-  
gle household, e.g. a couple or family. This is most likely to be a  
self-contained one- or two-bedroom flat or studio apartment.  
Amendments to the Town and Country Planning \(General  
Permitted Development\) \(England\) Order 2015, updated permitted  
development rights between certain use classes. Unless an Article  
4 Direction is in force, a change of use from Use Class C4 \(small  
HMO\) to a single house \(Use Class C3\) is covered by permitted  
development rights. This also applies in reverse where change of  
use from Use Class C3 to Use Class C4 can be carried out through  
permitted development. Where permitted development rights  
apply there is no need to apply for express planning permission for  
change of use although if any external building works are involved,  
or if buildings are amalgamated or sub-divided, planning permis-  
sion will be needed. Some local authorities have made Article 4  
Directions to remove these rights either in parts or all of their areas  
to prevent a high concentration of student rented houses in one  
area, a situation known as ‘studentification’, which can cause prob-  
lems for the local community.  
# 5.2 The Housing Act 2004  
*Part 1\: housing conditions*  
Part 1 of the Housing Act relates to housing conditions and applies  
to every type of accommodation. It provides a system for assess-  
ing conditions – the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, **24-8 Housing for students and young people**  
HHSRS – and gives local authorities powers to tackle poor housing  
based on the severity of the health and safety hazards.  
*Part 2\: licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation \(HMOs\)*  
ACCOMMODATION MANAGED OR CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE  
SECTOR PROVIDERS  
Statutory controls on HMOs under the Housing Act can be con-  
fusing. The term HMO applies to a wide range of housing types,  
mainly in the private rented sector where standards have histor-  
ically been low. In essence, the Housing Act defines HMOs as  
accommodation occupied by more than one household and where  
households share one or more basic amenity \(such as a kitchen\).  
Part 2 of the Housing Act regulates HMOs by providing for  
them to be licensed by the local authorities. Licensing is mandatory  
for larger HMOs \(this includes those that are three storeys or more,  
five or more people of two or more households\) but can also be  
extended to smaller HMOs by the local authority.  
ANUK/Unipol’s *Code of Standards for Larger Residential*  
*Developments\: For Student Accommodation Not Managed and*  
*Controlled by Educational Establishments, \(2006, updated 2020\)*  
gives guidance for private sector providers of student accommo-  
dation and their tenants on similar lines to the codes that apply to  
HEEs described later.  
ACCOMMODATION MANAGED OR CONTROLLED BY HEES  
Student accommodation for people attending full-time courses that  
are managed or controlled by an educational establishment can be  
‘excepted’ from the definition of an HMO and from the licensing  
requirements of the Housing Act \(except for Part 1, which still  
applies\), provided the accommodation is designed and managed in  
accordance with an approved code of practice. The following codes  
were current at the time of writing in 2021\:  
• *The Universities UK/Guild HE Code of Practice for the*  
*Management of Student Housing*, 2019  
• *ANUK/Unipol’s Code of Standards for Larger Residential*  
*Developments for Student Accommodation Managed and*  
*Controlled by Educational Establishments*, 2019.  
The codes deal with a range of physical standards and manage-  
ment practices and also address student welfare and the fair and  
reasonable treatment of student tenants, reflecting the special char-  
acteristics of student accommodation which encompasses more  
than the basic provision of facilities. The codes are designed as  
‘statements of good practice’ and provide general guidance for the  
design of accommodation rather than detailed specifications, as the  
provision will vary between different projects and different loca-  
tions.  
The codes are also appropriate for accommodation for other  
non-HEE students and young people, but additional legislation  
may apply, for example if accommodation is provided for students  
under 18 years of age in FE establishments.  
# 5.3 Local authority requirements for HMOs  
Different local authorities develop their own codes of practice for  
HMOs, which are generally more specific than the aforementioned  
codes. The requirements may vary for different types of student  
accommodation – bedsits, studios, shared flats, etc. – and there may  
be variation in the way they are applied, for example, where there  
are requirements from other legislation, such as for listed build-  
ings. The local authority’s environmental department should be  
consulted at an early stage in the design. Typical requirements are  
as follows\:  
*Space standards*  
• Minimum room areas for study bedrooms, for single and shared  
occupancy  
• Minimum room areas for kitchens, kitchen/dining rooms and  
living rooms  
• Minimum areas for external communal space.  
*HHSRS rating system \(see aforementioned\)*  
• Design requirements to avoid hazards – damp, cold, security,  
lighting, sanitation, water, falls, electricity, heating and cooking.  
*Personal washing facilities*  
• Ratio of baths/showers to number of occupants – typically a  
minimum of one bath or shower for five people  
• Washbasins to be provided with all toilets  
• Washbasins may be required within bedrooms in larger HMOs  
• Maximum distance of shared bathrooms from bedrooms – typically  
no more than one floor away  
• Design and layout of bathrooms, minimum dimensions of appli-  
ances, finishes, heating, lighting and ventilation.  
\(Note\: The trend for ensuite facilities effectively means that  
actual requirement is now well in excess of the minimum standard  
set out earlier.\)  
*Toilet facilities*  
• Ratio of toilets to number of occupants – typically a minimum of  
one toilet for five people  
• Provided in a separate room to the bathroom if serving more than  
four people  
• Maximum distance of shared toilets from bedrooms – typically  
no more than one floor away  
• Design and layout, finishes, heating, lighting and ventilation.  
\(Note\: The trend for ensuite facilities effectively means that  
actual requirement is now well in excess of the minimum standard  
set out earlier.\)  
*Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food*  
• Maximum distance of kitchen from bedrooms – typically no  
more than one floor away, but can be further in smaller buildings  
such as ‘house’ style accommodation  
• Provision of dining rooms and furniture  
• Design and layout of kitchens to allow safe use by several people  
at the same time. Finishes and minimum dimensions of appli-  
ances, heating, lighting and ventilation  
• Ratio of kitchen facilities to number of occupants – typically one  
set of facilities for five people comprising a sink and drainer, a  
food cupboard \(500 mm wide base unit or 1000 mm wide wall  
unit\), a fridge \(130 litres\), freezer space \(60 litres\), worktop  
\(1000 mm min.\), three double power sockets in addition to those  
required for the appliances, a cooker with four burners, oven and  
grill. Additional facilities should be included where the kitchen  
is shared by larger numbers of people.  
\(Note\: Increasingly, educational and private providers are  
requesting a single fridge/freezer shelf per person, as opposed to  
the 130/60 litre appliances described earlier.\)  
*Fire safety and means of escape*  
• Requirement for fire doors, fire separation, lobbies, emergency  
lighting, fire-fighting equipment and automatic fire detection  
systems  
• Internal layout of shared flats – escape from bedrooms must not  
be through a higher risk area such as a kitchen.  
*Management\: The Management of Houses in Multiple*  
*Occupation \(England\) Regulations 2006*  
These regulations set out the responsibilities of both managers  
and occupiers. They include requirements for cleaning, mainte-  
nance and repairs, and provision of water supply, drainage, gas and electric supplies, means of escape, ventilation, recycling and waste  
management as well as safety protection to roofs, balconies and  
windows.  
# 5.4 Fire safety  
Each local authority has requirements prior to issuing a licence  
for use of a building as an HMO. All must comply with *The*  
*Management of Houses in Multiple Occupations \(England\)*  
*Regulations 2006*. As for other building types, the responsibility  
for safety lies with the ‘responsible person’, who is required to pre-  
pare a fire risk assessment under the Fire Safety Order.  
New-build HMOs should be designed in accordance with  
the UK Building Regulations. *Fire Safety\: Approved Document*  
*B* provides guidance on the design of escape routes, with rec-  
ommendations for the planning and protection of escape routes  
and separation between areas of higher fire load. It also sets out  
provisions for splitting larger buildings into smaller fire rated  
compartments. External fire spread from the building of fire ori-  
gin to adjacent premises is addressed in the Approved Document  
B and provisions are made for the fire service to access the build-  
ing externally and internally. Note that access for fire engines to  
different parts of the building can have significant implications  
for the site plan and form of the building, particularly on con-  
stricted sites. A key introduction in the revised 2020 Approved  
Document Part B is that sprinklers are now required in all new  
residential buildings with a top habitable floor above 11 m. This  
is likely to include a very large proportion of new student res-  
idential developments. Following the Grenfell disaster, added  
focus has been placed on the design and specification of external  
wall systems and their combustibility, which should be carefully  
considered.  
An alternative approach to following the Approved Document  
B is to adopt a fire engineered solution, designed by a technically  
proficient fire consultant, where the fire safety for the building is  
tailored to the risk involved and the layout to achieve an equal level  
of life safety protection. Longer travel distances may be acceptable  
if a higher level of detection and warning systems are provided.  
Means of escape in case of fire is also covered by the Housing  
Act and by the approved codes of practice that apply to educa-  
tional establishments \(as discussed earlier\). Sprinklers will still be  
required in line with Approved Document B.  
False fire alarms can be a problem in student residences both  
for the fire services and for residents, particularly where full evac-  
uation is required. In some areas, the fire services will only answer  
an alarm call if the existence of the fire is confirmed. Fire systems  
should be designed to minimise accidental false alarms insofar as  
this is possible. The location of extinguishers, detectors and call  
points, the design of fire doors and glazing should be considered  
carefully to reduce the risk of misuse, for example, extinguishers  
let off, fire doors wedged open and to avoid an institutional feel.  
See also Chapter 11, Fire Safety.  
# 5.5 Noise  
*The Building Regulations, Resistance to Sound\: Approved*  
*Document E* applies to ‘Rooms for Residential Purposes’, and  
includes requirements for different parts of the construction. Since  
noise is a major source of annoyance in student residences, some  
universities may require standards above Part E. The use of adja-  
cent study bedrooms rooms for leisure, study and sleep contains  
inherent conflict and students do not keep regular hours. Consider  
noise from both inside and outside the building\: from kitchens  
and circulation areas, badly adjusted door closers, lifts, service  
ducts, etc. In planning the accommodation, it is important to sepa-  
rate potentially noisy areas, such as common rooms, from student  
bedrooms and to insulate each individual study bedroom to a high  
standard. In some more demanding environments, ambient external  
noise levels may dictate ventilation strategies, so an acoustic strat-  
egy should be reviewed early.  
# Housing for students and young people 24-9  
# 5.6 Ventilation  
*The Building Regulations, Ventilation\: Approved Document F*  
applies to student accommodation.  
Student accommodation is predominantly naturally ventilated,  
except where external conditions make this inappropriate – for  
example because of noise or air pollution – and this allows students  
to exercise some control over their environment by opening their  
windows. This is particularly important in study bedrooms, which  
are usually small and may feel claustrophobic when temperatures  
rise. An open window also allows the student to hear activity in  
the wider campus, or city, providing a sense of connection. Where  
mechanical ventilation is necessary, heat recovery should be con-  
sidered. Artificial cooling should be limited, and in some cases will  
need to be justified to meet carbon reduction requirements. Student  
rooms may be left unoccupied for long periods during the holidays,  
and adequate background ventilation is important. Overheating can  
be an issue in corridors and, as in other communal areas, building  
management systems can be used with opening windows to man-  
age ventilation.  
Shared bathrooms and kitchens are used intensively. As the  
rooms are generally stacked vertically, extracts can be combined  
to discharge efficiently at roof level. In student accommodation  
bathrooms are usually internal, so problems of condensation are  
common where ventilation is inadequate.  
# 5.7 Access and inclusion\: Equality Act, BS8300 and  
# Disability Discrimination Act  
From 2010, the Equality Act replaced the Disability Discrimination  
Acts except in Northern Ireland where the DDA still applies. Under  
the Equality Act 2010, universities must not discriminate against  
students in the provision of education, or access to any benefit,  
facility or service, by excluding them or by subjecting them to  
any other detriment. It is important to consult with the university/  
private developer about provision for disabled students under the  
Equality Act from planning stages through to construction. BS  
8300\:2018 Volumes 1 & 2 give recommendations for the design  
of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of disabled  
people including requirements for accessible rooms. It applies to  
university and college halls of residence.  
*The Building Regulations, Access to and Use of Buildings\:*  
*Approved Document M, Volumes 1 & 2* aims to ensure that build-  
ings are accessible and useable by everyone, regardless of disability,  
age or gender, and without unnecessary separation or segregation.  
Universities place great importance on inclusion. It is likely  
that many disabled students will not be wheelchair users but will  
have other impairments. Sleeping accommodation should aim to be  
convenient for all – a proportion should therefore be designed for  
independent use by wheelchair users, while standard rooms should  
have a degree of flexibility or adaptability to be suitable for people  
who do not use a wheelchair, but may have other difficulties, e.g. a  
visual impairment or limited dexterity.  
There are different standards for the proportion of wheelchair  
accessible bedrooms that should be provided in any scheme. The  
university or private provider will have a view on this and the local  
authority will have their own requirements, so early consultation  
is essential. Provision is often made up of a number of accessible  
rooms plus adaptable rooms – these are rooms that can easily be  
converted to accessible rooms if there is a demand.  
Accommodation for disabled people should be integrated with  
other student rooms, which suggests that they should be distrib-  
uted throughout the residences at different floors. Wheelchair  
users should be able to reach and use all facilities – common  
rooms, kitchen, laundry, etc. Socialising with other students is an  
important part of student life – and therefore protected through  
equality legislation as a civil right – so access to social areas, such  
as kitchen/dining rooms, is doubly important. These issues have  
implications for provision of lifts and consequently for the form of  
the accommodation \(see Section 4\). Some universities will require **24-10 Housing for students and young people**  
disabled students and wheelchair users to be able to access all study  
bedrooms so that they can visit friends. Others provide study bed-  
rooms for wheelchair users and the kitchen/dining room at ground  
floor level, but no lift access to other rooms \(for example in ‘house’  
style accommodation\). This approach can be argued as acceptable,  
but it is still likely to be interpreted on a case-by-case basis by each  
different local authority. Where residential accommodation is used  
for conferences and holiday letting, it becomes more like ‘hotel’  
accommodation, and should therefore incorporate appropriate pro-  
visions, e.g. sizing of stairs, doors and the provision of lifts. Where  
there is provision for wheelchair users to visit other students, the  
effective clear width of doors to standard study bedrooms will need  
to be adequate to admit wheelchair users. Some students require a  
high level of assistance. Consideration should be given to the pro-  
vision of an adjacent bedroom next to the accessible room, with a  
connecting door, for a ‘companion’/personal assistant. Appropriate  
fittings and equipment will be required in shared facilities such as  
kitchen/dining rooms and laundries as well as in accessible rooms.  
A unisex wheelchair accessible WC should be provided for visi-  
tors.  
# 6 THE STUDY BEDROOM  
# 6.1 Functions  
The study bedroom is the most important element in the design.  
It has to facilitate a range of functions in a small space – sleeping,  
studying, relaxing and socialising. It is the students’ home while  
they are at university, and they should be able to impose their  
personality on it to help avoid the institutional character that can  
easily arise with large numbers of repetitive rooms. It must feel  
private and secure and, ideally, have a reasonable view. It must  
have good light and ventilation that the student should be able to  
control. Good acoustic insulation from adjoining rooms, corridors  
and from the outside is very important. The room and furniture  
must be robust and easy to clean and maintain. Study bedroom  
types include rooms with or without ensuite bathrooms, and ‘stu-  
dio’ rooms with ensuite bathroom and kitchen area. Rooms may be  
single or shared. The most common type is the single, ensuite study  
bedroom \(Figure 24.8\).  
# 6.2 Room size and shape  
A study bedroom for one person \(without ensuite bathroom\) can be  
as small as 8 m2, but this is extremely tight and a more appropriate  
minimum area is 10 m2. A small sized room with ensuite bathroom  
is typically 13 m2. To optimise the plan, study bedrooms are usu-  
ally rectangular with the ensuite bathroom at the rear of the room.  
Typical modest room sizes for other types of student room are\:  
• Studio room for one student with ensuite bathroom and kitchen  
area\: 18 m2  
• Studio flat for one student or a couple with ensuite bathroom and  
kitchenette\: 30 m2  
.  
Carefully consider the proportions of the room – the furniture  
layout and the position of the door, window, built-in cupboards,  
sockets and fixed lighting to ensure that the room will accommo-  
date different activities and moods. The larger the area, the easier  
this becomes, but even a small room can be designed to allow some  
variation in the arrangement of furniture. Features such as window  
seats, built-in shelves, alcoves, etc. can also be used to enhance  
character. Consider the height of the window and views when the  
student is sitting at their desk or on the bed. Where it is feasible to  
provide larger rooms – for example where students have a choice  
of rents – it is possible to design for greater flexibility and to ‘zone’  
the different functions of the room and to allow the student to  
change the furniture layout, Figures 24.9a and 24.9b.  
# 6.3 Furniture and finishes  
The careful design of built-in furniture and careful selection of loose  
furniture is essential to the function and appearance of small study  
bedrooms, which should feel welcoming and attractive. Lighting,  
fabrics and colours should be selected to create a harmonious design.  
Furniture and fittings should be robust, but not institutional in charac-  
ter. Built-in furniture can be used to enhance the character of the room  
and optimise the use of the space. Typical provision is as follows\:  
• Bed\: single bed or wider bed \(approx. 1220 mm\). Beds may have  
a storage drawer under. Usually doubles as a sofa, so consider pro-  
viding a back rest along the wall. Provide a bedside table or shelf.

*3 hanging rail; 4\) bathroom pod; 5\) full-height window; 6\) movable pinboard; 7\) wardrobe; 8\) built-in bedhead shelf/storage;*  
*9\) window with shutter in splayed opening* • Desk\: should be as generous as possible to take a computer,  
books, files, etc. May include drawers. If the window sill is at, or  
slightly above, desk height it can be used as an extra shelf.  
• Desk chair.  
• Easy chair\: if sufficient space.

# Housing for students and young people 24-11  
• Shelving\: often built-in. May be arranged to serve the function  
of a bedside table.  
• Wardrobe\: often built-in. Incorporate shelves if there is no chest  
of drawers.  
• Chest of drawers\: if sufficient space. Can be used to extend the  
desk if it is same height and depth.  
• Mirror\: position where there is enough space and light for the  
student to see themselves full length.  
• Pin board\: generous provision to discourage use of walls. A  
small pin board or other writing surface on the outside of the  
room door is useful.  
• Curtains and blinds\: rooms are small but often have full-height  
windows – consider issues of privacy.  
• Washbasin\: a washbasin is often provided in study bedrooms  
when ensuite bathrooms are not provided, and should be sepa-  
rated from the main area of the room by containing it within the  
wardrobe unit or behind a room divider.  
• Mini-fridge\: occasionally required.  
# 6.4 Ensuite bathrooms  
Standard ensuite bathrooms add approximately 2.8 m2 to the study  
bedroom area and should be carefully planned to ensure that the  
small space functions well. Bathrooms are now usually supplied  
as prefabricated pods, which allows the intricate work involved in  
the finishes and in waterproofing showers and floors to be carried  
out under factory conditions and avoids delays to other trades on  
site. If a supplier’s standard ensuite pod is used, the dimensions  
will have significant implications for the overall design of the  
study bedroom. Pods can be constructed in concrete, steel or glass  
reinforeced plastic. Concrete and steel pods can be more easily  
designed as bespoke items and have a greater choice of finishes.  
Acoustic and fire separation between study bedrooms requires  
careful consideration with prefabricated pods. Access to service  
ducts should be from the corridor.  
Bathrooms with traditional construction can be designed as a  
wet room, or incorporate a shower tray with a door or curtain. A  
wet room helps to optimise use of the space, but make it more diffi-  
cult to keep the contents of the small space dry. The floor also takes  
time to dry. Accessible bathrooms require a flat floor.  
# 6.5 Studio rooms  
Studio rooms include an ensuite bathroom and a kitchen area  
\(Figure 24.10\). The kitchen area usually includes a fridge, sink,  
cupboard, hob and/or microwave and cooker extract. Some worktop  
area will be required and ideally also a surface to eat on, separate  
from the desk. Extraction will require ducts to be incorporated into  
the plans. The kitchen should be designed so that it does not domi-  
nate the study bedroom. If the kitchen area is located on the escape  
route between the sleeping area and the room door, details should  
be agreed with the local authority. Additional fire provisions, such  
as fire suppression, or hobs with timers, may be required.  
# 6.6 Services  
Students should be able to control their environment to some  
degree. Consideration should also be given to erratic patterns of  
occupation of study bedrooms and measures should be incorpo-  
rated to reduce energy consumption, e.g. to ensure that lights are  
not left on when rooms are vacant \(see also Section 5\). Access for  
maintenance and meter reading should be arranged from corridors  
to avoid the need for access to the student rooms.  
*Lighting*  
Good natural light is essential. General artificial lighting should  
be supplemented by task lighting to serve desk and bed positions  
and should be switched so that it can be controlled from the bed  
and room door. The student should be able to adjust the artificial  
lighting to suit different activities and moods – working, social-  
ising, etc. **24-12 Housing for students and young people**  
# 6.7 Disabled students  
Requirements for accessible rooms are addressed in the *Building*  
*Regulations, Access to and Use of Buildings\: Approved Document*  
*M*. Standards set out in BS 8300\:2018 Volumes 1 & 2, which can be  
more onerous, may also be required by the university. Wheelchair  
users require larger study bedrooms, with room for a wheelchair  
turning space between furniture and provision of an appropriate  
ensuite bathroom. The design of fittings and finishes should be  
suitable for access from a wheelchair. Study bedrooms may also  
require adaptations to meet the specific needs of individual disa-  
bled students, as these will vary depending on the particular nature  
of their impairment. Consider\:  
• Design of room door and access into the room  
• Height of the desk \(which may be adjustable\) and space below  
for wheelchair to slide under  
• Access and use of cupboards and shelving  
• Design of ironmongery and controls for window opening, cur-  
tains and blinds  
• Position of electrical sockets and switches  
• Provision of telephone, emergency call point and fire alarm bea-  
con  
• Provision of space to store the unused wheelchair without  
obstruction  
• Design of ensuite bathroom  
• Levels of lighting and choice of colours for people with visual  
impairments  
• Visual alarms or vibrating alarms for people with hearing  
impairments.  
**24.10** *Studio room with ensuite shower/WC/basin and kitchenette*  
*at Torquay House, London, designed by MJP Architects. 1\) bed;*  
*2\) desk; 3\) kitchenette; 4\) kitchen storage; 5\) shower room;*  
*6\) wardrobe*  
*Heating*  
Systems and controls will be determined by the university or  
commercial provider’s strategy for energy conservation and for  
charging, and also by the length of let \(term time only, or all year\).  
*Internet and power*  
*S*tudents require excellent internet access for study and social activ-  
ities. Technology for internet access is constantly advancing, so  
that the most appropriate system should be agreed as each project  
is designed and to suit the requirements of the university. Wi-Fi is  
cheaper than data cabling and gives students the flexibility to work  
where they choose. TV provision is generally accessed via the inter-  
net. As a guide, a typical provision would be three double sockets,  
one twin USB outlet and one double data point. The location of  
sockets and electrical trunking should be considered in relation to  
furniture arrangements. Surface trunking is unattractive and can be  
concealed beneath the desk, but should also be arranged to allow  
easy access to sockets – for example to easily remove a laptop.  
*Ventilation*  
Natural ventilation should be provided with opening windows  
where possible, fitted with restrictors to prevent students from fall-  
ing and also for security for ground floor rooms. Adjustable louvres  
or perforated screens may also be used \(in combination with fixed  
windows\) to provide natural ventilation while avoiding the risk of  
falls or dropped objects.  
*Recycling*  
Bins for recycling may be required within the study bedroom.  
# 7 KITCHEN/DINING ROOMS  
# 7.1 Role  
In student accommodation, kitchen/dining rooms provide a key  
social focus for each group of students that they serve, with oppor-  
tunities for casual encounters, friendship and support. Kitchen/  
dining rooms may be extended to incorporate a living area with  
sofas and a TV. Kitchens may also be used for informal study  
and group working. The activities foster a sense of ownership of  
the accommodation that in turn encourages responsible behav-  
iour. The design and character of the room should be attractive  
and welcoming and allow the students to adopt the space as their  
own. One kitchen/dining room will typically serve five to eight stu-  
dents, although in some universities they may serve ten or more,  
particularly in ‘house’ type accommodation or in halls where the  
university also provides central catering facilities as an alternative.  
Kitchen/dining rooms can be arranged to overlook common  
areas such as entrances, stairs and halls, providing further oppor-  
tunities for interaction and a degree of security through informal  
supervision. They should be located to avoid noise and nuisance  
to study bedrooms. The dining areas should be designed to allow  
all the students in the unit to eat at the same time. Furniture should  
not be fixed to avoid creating an institutional character. Provision  
of Wi-Fi is essential to allow students to make full use of the space.  
Kitchens will be heavily used and should allow several peo-  
ple to prepare food simultaneously. They must be designed to be  
functional, robust and easy to clean. As a guide, a length of work  
surface of approximately 3600 mm, including cooker and sink, will  
be sufficient for five people. Where kitchens serve larger numbers  
of students, the provision of cookers, sinks, fridges and storage will  
need to be increased to meet statutory requirements \(see Section 5  
above\). Ideally, a microwave oven should be provided as well as a  
conventional cooker.  
Cupboards should be provided for each student for storage  
of dry food and kitchen equipment. Locks are often provided on  
cupboards, and sometimes even on fridges, to avoid food being  
stolen. However, in accommodation such as self-contained flats **Housing for students and young people 24-13**  
and houses there may be no locks, to promote a sense of mutual  
responsibility. At the other extreme, in some accommodation,  
students are expected to keep cooking equipment and food in  
their rooms, but this is inconvenient, causes mess and undermines  
social interaction. Kitchens can be messy\: consider what will  
be visible from outside the building and ensure that there is an  
appropriate storage place for unattractive items, such as ironing  
boards and bins.  
# 7.2 Services  
Measures should be incorporated to reduce energy consumption  
\(see Section 9.6\).  
*Internet and power*  
Provide sockets at worktop and at low level. Some universities  
monitor and charge for cookers separately to discourage wasteful  
use of energy. Cookers can be fitted with a time switch in case they  
are left on by mistake. Wi-Fi should be provided. Provide sockets  
by sofas and seating.  
*Lighting and mechanical extract*  
Provide generous opening windows where possible \(with restric-  
tors if necessary\) positioned to avoid nuisance from noise and  
smell to neighbouring study bedrooms. Artificial lighting should be  
appropriate for preparing food in the kitchen area, but more subtle  
and attractive lighting should be provided in the dining and living  
spaces.  
*Refuse and recycling*  
Position bins for easy cleaning and emptying. Separate recycling  
bins should be provided in line with university/ private providers’  
waste management strategies. It is important to design a place for  
bulky bins into the kitchen layout, otherwise they can spoil the  
appearance of the room.  
# 7.3 Inclusive access  
Where the kitchen serves study bedrooms for wheelchair users, it  
should be designed with appropriate equipment and fittings and  
sufficient area to allow for wheelchairs to manoeuvre, including  
worktops with adjustable height and room for the wheelchair  
to slide below. It is not possible to provide cupboards under  
these worktops, as in standard kitchens. This may require the  
room to be enlarged. Some duplication of equipment may also  
be necessary.  
# 8 BATHROOMS  
# 8.1 Facilities  
Bathrooms, showers and WCs are usually designed to the mini-  
mum practical area. Numbers of facilities should be in accordance  
with statutory requirements \(see Section 5\). Shared WCs should be  
separate from bathrooms unless serving very few people. Where  
facilities are shared, additional washbasins are sometimes provided  
in study bedrooms.  
Facilities need to withstand rough use and simpler arrange-  
ments are potentially easier to construct, clean and maintain.  
Factory-assembled bathroom ‘pods’ are now generally used to  
achieve a high standard of construction \(see Section 6.4\). Service  
ducts should be carefully detailed and located, with service access  
to ensuite bathrooms from corridors. Where bathrooms are not  
ensuite, consider proximity to study bedrooms, and acoustic and  
visual privacy.  
Provide good mechanical ventilation, especially in showers,  
with moisture-resistant light fittings. Towel rails, shelves and hooks  
in the shower area should be out of the way of the shower itself.  
Controls should be provided to showers to avoid risk of scalding.  
Flooring should be slip resistant.  
# 9 OTHER FACILITIES  
Provision will depend on the number of students living in the accom-  
modation and on the availability of facilities nearby and to some  
extent the nature of the provider. They may include the following\:  
# 9.1 Reception and circulation areas  
Entrances should be light and welcoming and avoid a mean or  
utilitarian character – the design should create an identity for the  
residences. In larger residences, there may be a staffed reception  
or porter’s lodge or office. In other schemes, provision may be  
required for a temporary reception to receive students at the start  
of term or conference guests in the holidays. In up-market com-  
mercial schemes, the design and ‘branding’ of the reception are  
important and a more generous area with seating may be required.  
Wi-Fi should be provided. Long narrow corridors without daylight  
or views should be avoided. Staircases are a place where chance  
meetings occur, and are an opportunity to design an attractive  
feature on circulation routes. Mailboxes may be provided in the  
entrance area. Students receive an increasingly large number of  
parcels through mail order.  
# 9.2 Laundry  
A laundry serving groups of residents should be provided with  
washing and drying machines of a robust commercial type with  
emergency cut-off switch. There may be a sink for hand washing  
clothes, facilities for ironing and folding clothes, and seats for wait-  
ing. Provide good lighting and ventilation and floor gullies to avoid  
flooding. Fittings and equipment should allow easy maintenance.  
Services such as electricity supply, hot water, etc. must be adequate  
for the level of use. Choose the location carefully – a laundry close  
to a common room can form part of a social hub, but laundries can  
be noisy, smelly and humid and should be arranged to avoid nui-  
sance to study bedrooms or at the building’s entrance.  
# 9.3 Cleaners’ storage  
Where accommodation is in independent flats or houses, cleaning  
is often the students’ responsibility and a tall cupboard \(housing a  
hoover/mop/ironing board\) will be sufficient. Where the university  
arranges cleaning, provide central stores for the cleaners within a  
reasonable distance of the rooms. In larger schemes, there should be  
a store on each floor. Provision may also be required for facilities  
for the cleaning and reception staff\: WCs, lockers, staff room, etc.  
# 9.4 Other possible facilities  
• Central common room/television room/party room that may also  
be used for informal or group working. Often poorly used if insuf-  
ficient thought has been given to demand and the kind of activities  
that could take place. The room and furniture should be designed to  
be welcoming and attractive. Wi-Fi should be provided. Common  
rooms should be located so that activity is visible from main circu-  
lation routes to encourage use. Party rooms need to be located to  
reduce nuisance to study bedrooms. A kitchen area will be required  
for students to prepare food and drink.  
• Area for vending machines  
• WC/accessible WC for visitors  
• Seminar room/study area\: central rooms with Wi-Fi can provide  
a place for group working and a sociable alternative to working  
in study bedrooms  
• Games room  
• Music practice room  
• In more luxurious schemes, a gym, cinema, café or convenience  
store may be provided  
• Luggage store  
• Wardens/staff flats may be provided adjacent to or within the  
scheme, and may be studios or flats of various sizes, including  
family accommodation  
• Guest bedrooms. **24-14 Housing for students and young people**  
# 9.5 External areas and parking  
Well-designed landscaped areas around residences can provide  
places for recreation, socialising and informal working and will be  
significantly more useful if Wi-Fi is available. Promoting health  
and well-being is an increasing concern, and areas for exercise and  
informal games – football, Frisbee, etc. – should be provided where  
possible. With university projects, the design of the public realm  
should aim to create the sense of a coherent, integrated campus.  
The planning authority and the university will have policies for  
the provision of parking, and the allowance for student parking is  
usually very minimal, although spaces will be required for park-  
ing for disabled people, which should be close to entrances. To  
guard against theft and for personal safety, parking areas should be  
overlooked, well lit and relatively close to entrances. Each student  
arrives at the start of term with quantities of luggage, and sufficient  
space should be provided near to entrances for unloading several  
vehicles simultaneously. Taxis are often used for nights out and  
there should be provision for taxi drop-off close to entrances. To  
encourage use of sustainable modes of transport, there should be  
well-designed, well-lit footpaths and cycle routes and good pro-  
vision of secure, covered cycle parking. The local authority will  
provide guidance on the level of cycle storage although this will  
typically be 1\:2–1\:4 \(cycle space\: student\). Approx. 5 per cent of  
the total amount are typically required to be enlarged spaces for a  
range of accessible options  
# 9.6 Energy consumption  
There are many opportunities to reduce energy consumption in the  
detailed design of the accommodation and choice of controls, fit-  
tings and appliances, including\:  
• Building management systems, and a good understanding of  
how to use the building \(heating, ventilation, etc.\) by staff and  
residents  
• Low energy light fittings  
• Presence detectors for kitchen, ensuite bathroom and communal  
area lights  
• Thermostatic radiator valves  
• Heat recovery systems  
• Low flow rate taps and dual flush WCs  
• Sustainable urban drainage  
• Air and ground source heat pumps  
• Renewable energy sources.  
# 9.7 Refuse and recycling collection  
Develop a waste management strategy at an early stage and consult  
the waste collection services about their requirements for access.  
The size of any bin store will depend on the number of students,  
the requirements for recycling and the frequency of collection. Bins  
filled by staff may be cleaner and tidier than those used by students,  
but all are potentially untidy, smelly and attract vermin. Stores  
should be easy to access, clean and maintain. Locate to reduce nui-  
sance to residents, and provide good ventilation.  
# 9.8 Safety and security  
The design should address potential risks of attack, vandalism  
and theft. Personal safety is a major issue in student housing and  
students often return home late at night. Theft is also a common  
problem as students own computers and other valuable equip-  
ment, and it is difficult to prevent strangers entering residences by  
‘tail-gating’. Windows to ground floor rooms are particularly vul-  
nerable.  
The building should be designed so that external areas – such  
as entrances, paths and car parks – and common areas within the  
building – such as staircases – are overlooked to provide informal  
supervision. Good external lighting is essential, with provision of  
safe walking routes. CCTV and alarm points may also be required  
in external areas.  
Access control swipe card systems are commonly used for doors  
instead of keys, which are a nuisance to replace when lost. Where  
there are sufficient numbers of residents, there may be a staffed  
reception. Provide spy holes in study bedroom doors/entrance  
doors, as applicable.  
The design should also avoid features that encourage anti-social  
or dangerous behaviour\: skateboarding and climbing are common  
problems.  
# 10 CONFERENCE USE  
# 10.1 Additional needs  
Many universities use student residences for conferences or holi-  
day lets during the vacations and this has implications for design\:  
• The fire risk assessment should address the proposed use  
• Rooms with ensuite bathrooms will be preferred  
• Double beds, accessed from both sides, may be required with  
implications for room size  
• A higher standard of fittings and finishes with a ‘hotel’ design  
style may be required  
• Central linen stores may be required with easy access to study  
bedrooms  
• A term-time store for equipment that is provided to conference  
guests, such as kettles  
• Lockable storage may be provided for students’ possessions and  
a safe for conference guests  
• Reception area, seminar rooms or other facilities to support con-  
ference activities. **25 Laboratories**

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Definition  
A laboratory is a facility which provides controlled conditions in  
which scientific methods including research, development and  
analysis may be conducted or taught.  
# 1.2 Scope  
There is great diversity among laboratories; however, many com-  
monalities are found in their architecture and engineering. This  
section of the *Handbook* provides an indication of the basic require-  
ments specific to a broadly representative range of laboratory  
facilities. The information provided relates primarily to bench-scale  
laboratories, focusing mainly on the commonalities and provides  
guidance for their planning and design. The figures presented are  
based on average requirements. Specific needs, ascertained through  
detailed briefing with the client, may vary these figures.  
While this section provides information on the design of new  
facilities, the broad principles can also be applied to renovation/  
refurbishment projects. In these instances, compromises may need  
to be made due to space restraints, and operational procedures may  
have to be put in place to compensate.  
# 1.3 Laboratory types and sectors  
In this chapter, laboratories are grouped into two main types, wet  
and dry, all of which incorporate various scientific disciplines and  
work processes. As the requirement for flexible spaces is seen as  
key for delivering collaborative, multi-discipline research, the need  
for space with a combination of both wet and dry areas has become  
more common.  
*Wet laboratories*\: utilise, test and analyse chemicals, drugs or  
other material/biological matter. They typically require piped ser-  
vices \(including water, specialised utilities\) and ventilation, for  
example, chemical science, biomedical laboratories.  
*Dry laboratories*\: contain dry stored materials, electronics and/  
or large instruments. They typically require some piped services,  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-28  
accurate temperature and humidity control, dust control and clean  
power, for example, analytical, engineering laboratories.  
Teaching laboratories may be wet, dry or a combination of both,  
but they differ in that they *teach* scientific method.  
They can be found in primary, secondary schools and higher  
education institutions.  
# 1.4 Sectors  
Laboratories can be found in private, public or academic sectors.  
*Private laboratories*\: focus on research, development and anal-  
ysis, but are usually driven by the need to enhance the operation’s  
profit potential.  
*Public laboratories*\: focus on research, development and anal-  
ysis specifically in the public’s interest. They are in many respects  
similar to those of the private sector.  
*Academic laboratories \(excluding schools\)*\: focus on teaching  
laboratory methods and include laboratories that engage in generat-  
ing research within an academic institution. They may be privately  
or publicly funded. School laboratories focus on teaching science  
as set out in their curriculum and include laboratories that engage  
with other subjects such as design, technology and food studies.  
Laboratories \(excluding schools\) are typically part of a facility  
which may include various space types such as\:  
• Reception/lobby  
• Office/write-up  
• Auditorium/conference/seminar/meeting  
• Social/interaction  
• General storage  
• Library  
• Catering  
• Child care  
• Clinic/health unit  
• Wellness centre  
• Shared retail  
• Loading dock and service yard  
• Parking.  
In the past, private sector facilities were more expensive and larger  
than government or academic facilities as commercial concerns need  
to produce a constant flow of discoveries that can be taken to market.  
Consequently, more ‘incentives’ were provided in the form of state-  
of-the-art facilities to retain and attract talent. This model has been  
adopted by many academic institutions and smaller research organisa-  
tions as a result of increasing competition within the industry. This has  
led to an improvement in the quality of their facilities as private com-  
panies invest in more joint projects within academic research facilities.  
# 1.5 Environmental conditions  
A detailed assessment should be made with the stakeholders and  
the relevant regulatory authorities to define the environmental con-  
ditions and operational practices required for the facility as part of  
the briefing process and before the design starts, as this will impact  
on the specification of the laboratory’s physical and servicing  
requirements and its operational costs.  
**25-1** **25-2 Laboratories**  
The final form of the facility will also be dictated by the individ-  
ual site constraints and opportunities for each project and the varied  
preferences and detailed needs of the stakeholders, which are also  
defined as part of the briefing process.  
# 1.6 Containment  
In some laboratories, conditions are no more dangerous than in any  
other room. In many, however, hazards may be present that need to  
be contained and/or controlled including \(but not limited to\)\:  
• Biological/infectious agents \(to humans and/or animals\)  
• Genetically modified organisms  
• Poisons/chemicals  
• Flammable substances  
• Explosives  
• Radioactive material  
• Magnetic interference  
• Moving machinery  
• Extreme temperatures  
• High voltage.  
In accordance with legislative requirements, these hazards must  
be identified and countermeasures or mitigation strategies specific  
for each facility determined/implemented. Reference should be  
made to the legislative guidance, approved codes of practice and  
regulations produced by the law and relevant advisory bodies. For  
these, refer to the Bibliography at the end of this chapter.  
# 1.7 Cleanrooms  
A laboratory may be designed as a cleanroom facility. A cleanroom  
is defined as a room in which the concentration of airborne particles  
is controlled; which is constructed and used in a manner to mini-  
mise the introduction, generation and retention of particles inside  
the room; and in which other relevant parameters such as tempera-  
ture, humidity and pressure are controlled as necessary. Cleanroom  
conditions are typically required, for example, in micro and nano  
electronic research.  
The grades of cleanroom are defined by the global ISO classifica-  
tion system, ISO 14644–1 which classifies ranges from ISO 9 \(least  
clean\) to ISO 1 \(cleanest\). Table I shows how this compares to other  
international standards in the ranges ISO 3 to ISO 8, which reflect the  
standards generally required. Refer to EN ISO 14644–4 for guidance  
on the design, construction and start-up of cleanrooms.  
Laboratories may be designed as both cleanroom and contain-  
ment facilities. For example, some products require a Containment  
Level Category 2 to protect the operator and a cleanroom envi-  
ronment of ISO Class 5 to 9 to protect the product. Refer to

start-up of combined cleanroom and containment facilities.  
*Safe and secure*\: Safety must always be the first concern in lab-  
oratory design, and what the law requires is to look at what the  
risks are and to take measures, so far as is reasonably practicable,  
to tackle them. Securing a facility from unauthorised access is also  
of critical importance to prevent theft, misuse or, for facilities han-  
dling infectious agents, the release of pathogens.  
*Statistically reproducible data*\: One of the most fundamental  
requirements of successful scientific research is to provide statisti-  
cally reproducible data. The ability to achieve this relies not only  
on the availability of high quality reproducible material but also  
on the quality and appropriateness of the controlled physical envi-  
ronment.  
*Responsive to change*\: The need for change will result from  
the continuing and rapid developments in technology/equipment,  
evolving working methods and procedures, and increasingly strin-  
gent regulations. It should therefore be a fundamental principle  
that the basic design of a laboratory allows sufficient flexibility for  
future changes to be accommodated without the need for major and  
often costly alterations and with minimum disruption to operations.  
*Interaction and collaboration*\: Scientific interaction and col-  
laboration often lead to new inventions, new cures and faster  
progress. As a result, equipping laboratory facilities with spaces  
that encourage interaction and collaboration generally enhances the  
occupant’s ability to succeed.  
*Recruit and retain staff*\: Because of increasing competition in  
the scientific field, more effort and money are often invested to  
recruit and retain the best talent by creating high quality facilities  
that include attractive environments, state-of-the-art laboratories,  
extensive amenities and the latest in computer technology. These  
facilities serve to support employees and enhance user satisfaction,  
efficiencies and productivity.  
*Sustainability*\: Laboratories are typically energy-demanding  
because of their requirements as highly serviced spaces. In addi-  
tion, they may have intensive ventilation requirements and must  
meet health and safety codes which add to energy use. There  
are, however, significant opportunities for improving efficiencies  
while still meeting or exceeding operational and health and safety  
requirements. The basic objectives are to reduce consumption of  
non-renewable resources, minimise waste and create healthy,  
productive environments. If deemed important, a suitable strat-  
egy should be agreed between stakeholders and the design team.  
Labs 21 \(in USA and UK\) and S-Lab \(in UK\) are examples of  
organisations that provide useful information on sustainability in  
laboratories.  
# 2 LABORATORY LAYOUT GUIDANCE  
# 2.1 Key points  
The planning and design of modern laboratory facilities should be  
based on a combination of current best practice and predictions  
together with recognition of the future needs for flexibility.  
# 2.2 Laboratory planning modules  
A starting point for the planning and design of many laboratory  
facilities is the planning module which accommodates basic spa-  
tial requirements. It should provide adequate space for partitions,  
benches, floor standing equipment and extract devices, and aisles  
which minimise circulation conflicts/safety hazards. The labora-  
tory module should also be fully coordinated with the architectural  
and building engineering systems.  
The width of a typical laboratory planning module is defined  
in Table II.  
**Table I** **Comparison of the global ISO cleanroom classification system, EN ISO 14644–1, with other international standards**

distance between a bench and a fume cupboard and also requirements for Equality  
Act compliance.  
\*\* The minimum and maximum figures are largely dependent on equipment  
requirements. A 3300 mm minimum module width is recommended for most generic  
laboratory facilities to ensure that a bench and a fume cupboard \(nominal 900 mm\) can  
be accommodated on either wall.  
# 2.4 Structure  
Key design issues to consider in evaluating a structural system include\:  
• Ability to coordinate the structure with the laboratory planning  
modules  
• Slab thickness and effective floor-to-floor height  
• Ability to create penetrations for laboratory services in the initial  
design as well as over the life of the building  
• Potential for vertical or horizontal expansion  
• Superimposed loads  
• Vibration criteria  
• Cost.  
# 2.5 Structural grid  
The basic laboratory planning module forms a ‘template’for the build-  
ing’s structural grid. In most cases, the structural grid width equals two  
basic laboratory modules. The structural grid length is determined by  
not only the basic planning requirements but also the cost effectiveness  
and functional requirements of the structural system.  
Ideally, any columns placed on the grid should be incorporated  
into the design \(for example, within cores and built out walls or to the  
perimeter of the laboratory zone\) to provide an obstruction free work  
zone. In addition to columns, all fixed elements of structure, for exam-  
ple, floor slabs, braced bays, shear walls, service shafts, lift shafts and  
staircases, should be planned to minimise constraints on the extension  
and reconfiguration of the layout; see Figures 25.4 and 25.5.  
The module sizes noted in Table II reflect an efficient bay width.  
These could reduce in an open plan scenario or increase where spe-  
cialist equipment places greater spatial demands.  
The length of the module will depend on the unit size of the  
chosen laboratory furniture, requirements for freestanding equip-  
ment and the number of persons that will occupy the space; see  
Figure 25.1. However, further flexibility can be achieved by  
designing a laboratory module that works in both directions.  
This allows laboratory benches and equipment to be organised in  
either direction; see Figure 25.2a. This concept is more flexible  
than the basic laboratory module concept but may require a larger  
building.  
**25.1** *The basic planning module. A two-directional laboratory*  
*planning module offers maximum flexibility*  
# 2.3 Combining modules  
In addition to accommodating the basic and functional spatial  
requirements, modularity maximises efficiency and the potential  
for flexibility/adaptability. As modifications are required because of  
changes in laboratory use, instrumentation or departmental organi-  
sation, partitions can be relocated and laboratory units expanded or  
contracted into larger or smaller units without requiring significant  
reconstruction of structural or mechanical building elements; see  
Figures 25.2a, 25.2b, 25.2c.  
*Three-dimensional laboratory module*\: To create a three-dimen-  
sional laboratory module a basic or two-directional module must be  
defined, all vertical risers including fire stairs, lifts, restrooms and  
utilities shafts must be fully coordinated \(for example, vertically  
stacked\), and the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems  
must be coordinated in the ceiling to work with the corridor/cir-  
culation arrangements; see Figure 25.3. This concept provides the  
greatest flexibility.

**25.2c** *A laboratory module that works in both directions allows laboratory benches and equipment to be organised in either direction* **Laboratories 25-5**  
**25.3** *Three-dimensional laboratory planning module*  
# 2.6 Floor to floor height  
Actual floor-to-floor heights will need to be determined through  
thorough discussion with the stakeholders and the needs of the  
equipment and building services to be incorporated within the  
space. The issue of flexibility will also need to be reviewed and  
heights proposed to maximise the future use of the space; see Table  
III and Figure 25.3.  
In cases where floor to floors are more restrictive such as refur-  
bishment works in existing buildings and where safety requirements  
do not require a cleanable suspended ceiling, exposed soffit fixed  
services could be considered.  
Note, however, that the dimensions tabled may be inadequate  
for specialist equipment \(for example cyclotron, MRI, PET/CT  
Scanners, etc.\). These require individual consideration.  
*Superimposed loads*\: Structures must be designed in accordance  
with the appropriate British Standards, which will depend on the  
structural material adopted for the structure. For generic/bench-  
scale laboratories including equipment and corridors subject to  
loads greater than from crowds, such as wheeled vehicles, trol-  
leys and similar, design for\:  
4.0 kN/m2 + 2.5 kN/m2 for partitions  
Heavy engineering equipment, and vibration-sensitive equipment  
such as cyclotrons, nuclear magnetic resonances \(NMR\), electron  
microscopes etc., are most economically located on a ground-bear-  
ing floor slab and require consideration on an individual basis.

# 2.7 Vibration  
The structural frame system should take into account vibration  
throughout the laboratory areas where sensitive equipment, bal-  
ances and microscopes are being utilised. The principal sources of  
vibration that need to be considered are shown in Table IV.  
Vibrations can either be controlled directly through the design  
of the structure, independently by the use of isolation bearings or  
damping materials, or a combination of the two. The aim should  
be to design an economic structure with an appropriate level of  
vibration response.  
Basic techniques that should be utilised where possible to con-  
trol vibration are listed in Table V.  
The accurate selection of vibration criteria and prediction of  
vibration levels is important in laboratory design because con-  
struction costs increase as designed floor vibration levels decrease.  
Confirmation is also critical as it will significantly impact on slab  
thickness and weight with consequences to all other aspects of the  
structure \(column sizes, transfer beams, foundations, etc.\).  
Vibration criteria \(VC\) can be determined based on published  
vibration limits, manufacturer-provided criteria and subjective  
tests of vibration-sensitive equipment.  
ASHRAE \(American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-  
Conditioning Engineers\) and BBN \(Bolt Beranek and Newman\)\:  
ASHRAE studied the effects of vibration generated by heating,  
ventilation and air conditioning \(HVAC\) equipment in buildings  
and defined criteria widely adopted through the industry. Similarly,  
BBN developed the VC curves.  
*Response factors*\: Vibration levels are referred to in terms of  
Response Factors \(R\) where human perception is the primary concern.  
The R is simply a multiplier on the level of vibration at the average  
threshold of human perception. Therefore, R1 represents the magnitude  
of vibration just perceptible by a human, R2 is twice that and so on.  
*Root Mean Square Velocity \(RMS\)*\: In addition to human per-  
ception of vibration, in research spaces the vibration response needs  
to be limited for sensitive equipment such as microscopes, which  
often drives the design. Equipment manufacturers typically specify  
vibration limits in terms of RMS velocity as measured in one-third  
octave bands of frequency over the frequency range of 8 to 100 Hz.  
This is a measure of average amplitude over a certain period.  
Table VI compares both ASHRAE and BBN as well as  
Response Factors \(R\). The ISO criteria for human exposure are  
also shown. Criterion VC-A to VC-E are applicable to laboratory  
facilities though recently some specialist facilities are looking for  
spaces that exceed these.  
While it is a requirement to provide a high level of flexibility, it  
is normally accepted that to design all parts of the building such that  
extremely sensitive research equipment can be placed anywhere  
without further local isolation is not practical. Therefore, a vibra-  
tion design criterion and design strategy must be adopted that will  
satisfy the majority of needs, while accepting that local isolation  
devices will be used where a particular item of equipment has more  
stringent requirements. An economic solution with a defined level  
of flexibility \(agreed with the laboratory user\) may be to categorise  
the vibration response of different areas of the floor using response  
curves. For example, a maximum RMS velocity of 50 micrometres  
per second may be set as the target at the centre of floor panels.  
At points close to the columns, the criterion would increase to 25 **Laboratories 25-7**  
**Table VI Design criteria for sensitive instrumentation and equipment not otherwise vibration-isolated**  
\* The detail size refers to the line widths for microelectronics fabrication, the particle \(cell\) size for medical and pharmaceutical research, etc. The values given take into account  
the observation that the vibration requirements of many items depend upon the detail size of the process.  
micrometres per second thus allowing more sensitive equipment to  
be located at the perimeter or column locations.  
**Table VII** **Pros and cons of embedded service risers within the building floor plate**  
# Pros Cons  
# 2.8 Building services  
Typically, more than 35–50 per cent of the construction cost of a  
laboratory building can be attributed to the building services sys-  
tems \(mechanical, electrical and process\). Close coordination of  
these systems is necessary to ensure a flexible, economic and suc-  
cessfully operating facility.  
Three common strategies for servicing laboratories are as fol-  
lows, though needs may dictate a combination of any of them\:  
Potentially unrestricted views out Restricted flexibility  
Short horizontal service runs within Changes could disrupt adjacent spaces  
ceiling void  
Least space required out of floor plate Maintenance access within ‘clean’ environment  
Low cost impact  
# Table VIII Pros and cons of a sidestitial service zone  
# Pros Cons  
• Embedded service risers  
• Sidestitial service zone  
• Interstitial floor service zone.  
Good flexibility especially if services are  
modular  
Short horizontal service runs within ceiling void  
Maintenance access outside ‘clean’  
environment  
Restricted views on one side  
Medium cost impact  
Dedicated zone required out of floor  
plate  
*Embedded service risers*\: Vertical service risers are located  
within the building floor plate as required; see Figure 25.6. While  
this option offers the most economical solution, it is also the least  
flexible with respect to floor planning; see Table VII.  
*Sidestitial service zone*\: A vertical continuous service zone is  
located within the length of the laboratory area; see Figure 25.7.  
This option offers good flexibility and maintenance access and is  
potentially best suited to sites with unsuitable/undesirable views to  
one side; see Table VIII.  
**Table IX** **Pros and cons of an interstitial floor service zone**  
# Pros Cons  
No restrictions to views out  
Total flexibility for laboratories above or below  
Maintenance access outside ‘clean’ environment

**25.6** *Embedded service risers within the building floor plate*  
**25.7** *Sidestitial service zone*  
**25.8** *Interstitial floor service zone* *Interstitial floor service zone*\: A complete service floor zone is  
located either above or between laboratory floors; see Figure 25.8.  
This is potentially the most expensive of the options; however, it  
offers the greatest flexibility and excellent access for maintenance  
with minimum disruption to the laboratory functions; see Table IX.  
# 3 SPACE ORGANISATION  
# 3.1 Definitions  
The following definitions apply for the purpose of measurement  
within research laboratories\:  
*Laboratory worker*\: A user who is allocated a bench space  
within the primary laboratory space.  
*Researcher*\: A user who is directly involved in scientific work,  
including staff that may not have an allocated bench space within  
the primary laboratory space \(e.g. staff working predominantly on  
computer applications or senior staff who may work principally  
from an office space\).  
*Net Useable Area \(NUA\)*\: The NUA is the sum of primary,  
secondary and tertiary space. In laboratories and large open plan  
spaces \(e.g. multi-occupancy offices or grouped write-up spaces\),  
the measurement of secondary circulation spaces as contributing  
to NUA or to balance space may depend upon the configuration of  
the spaces and the extent to which circulation space may be consid-  
ered to contribute to the use of the space, other than exclusively for  
access and circulation. Schedules and drawings will clearly need  
to identify which areas have been measured as part of the balance  
space.  
NUA = Primary space + Secondary space + Tertiary space.  
*Gross Internal Area \(GIA\)*\: The GIA is the sum of NUA and  
balance space. The GIA does not include plant areas. The area  
required for plant rooms is particularly difficult to define at the  
early stages of design, as, depending on requirements, this could  
be anything between 25–100 per cent of the laboratory floor area.  
Therefore, comparative data is more useful if plant rooms are  
excluded from balance and GIA.  
GIA = NUA + Balance space  
# 3.2 Space designation \(academic teaching\)  
In primary schools, science is regarded as one of the specialist  
practical activities in the curriculum and generally utilises a space  
that could also be used to teach design and technology \(including  
food\) and art. This space can either be a stand-alone discrete room  
or an open bay within a standard classroom. The base requirements  
for these spaces are a sink, washable floor and furniture for ‘wet’  
practical activities.  
In secondary schools, laboratories are generally located as  
suites. In addition to the laboratories, non-teaching support spaces  
are required such as preparation and storage areas. These areas  
would also provide a departmental staff base with space for the  
secure storage of pupils’ records and other paperwork. Other  
associated teaching spaces for post-16-year-old students could  
include spaces such as a small science project room, greenhouse  
or microbiology room. In higher education, the traditional distinc-  
tion between teaching and research laboratories has become less  
important and an increasing number of institutions are integrating  
these areas. There are several reasons for creating ‘homogenous’  
laboratory facilities\:  
• Students at all levels are introduced to current techniques  
• Interaction is encouraged between faculty, graduate students and  
undergraduates  
• A standard serviced laboratory module accommodates change  
readily  
# Laboratories 25-9  
• Common and specialised equipment may be shared reducing  
project costs  
• Common facilities can share support spaces and specialty rooms  
• Greater utilisation of space and equipment enhances project cost  
justification  
• Teaching laboratories can be used for faculty research during  
semester breaks  
• For these reasons, the standards applicable to academic research  
laboratories are also applicable to higher education.  
# 3.3 Space designation \(wet and dry research  
# laboratories\)  
For the purpose of organisation, the different spaces in a laboratory  
facility are designated as primary, secondary, tertiary and balance  
spaces.  
*Primary space*\: Primary space is the area in which researchers per-  
form their tasks. It is divided into primary laboratory space and  
primary office/write-up space, each with different accommodation  
and service requirements.  
Primary laboratory space will normally include\:  
• Designated bench space for laboratory workers, including those  
who also have the use of an office/write-up space equipped with  
appropriate services and local storage  
• Additional workstations associated with a piece of equipment  
or an experimental procedure, which are not the principal work  
location of a particular person, but may be used by one or more  
persons from time to time including PC and other IT terminals,  
fume cupboards, extract cabinets and laminar flow cabinets  
• Shared storage for laboratory equipment and materials  
• Shared general facilities including display and notice boards, tel-  
ecoms, dispensers  
• Facilities for waste disposal  
• Services as applicable to the laboratory type.  
Primary office/write-up space will normally include\:  
• Write-up areas for researchers/laboratory workers  
• Offices for senior researchers/laboratory workers  
• Services as applicable to the space type \(similar to a standard  
office environment\).  
*Secondary space*\: Secondary spaces \(sometimes referred to as  
‘ancillary areas’ or ‘slave spaces’\) include all areas which accom-  
modate functions directly related to the operations carried out in  
the primary space.  
Secondary space will normally include\:  
• Facilities such as equipment rooms, instrument rooms and  
preparation rooms, which may not have special accommodation  
or service requirements, but which are better separated from the  
primary laboratories to increase utilisation through shared use  
• Highly specialised laboratory facilities such as containment  
suites, fermentation suites and decontamination suites whose  
accommodation needs are very different from primary labora-  
tory spaces  
• Services as applicable to the laboratory type.  
*Tertiary space*\: Tertiary spaces are those whose functions, in addi-  
tion to the primary and secondary spaces, support the goals and  
aspirations of the facility such as conference/meeting rooms, inter-  
action spaces, general storage, etc.  
*Balance space*\: Balance space will normally include cleaners’  
rooms, circulation spaces, lavatories, service risers and other cir-  
culation/support areas which are not defined as primary, secondary  
or tertiary space. **25-10 Laboratories**  
# 3.4 Assembly  
*Primary, secondary and tertiary space functional adjacencies*\:  
Zoning the building between laboratory and non-laboratory spaces  
will reduce costs because of the differing environmental require-  
ments. For example, the ventilation of laboratories may require 100  
per cent outside air while non-laboratory spaces can be designed  
with recirculated air or naturally ventilated, like an office building.  
Primary laboratory space is typically designed as modules to  
suit the briefed sizes and requirements with secondary laboratory  
spaces preferably in close proximity to the primary space for ease  
of access. As the secondary spaces will be shared by the laboratory  
teams, a separation zone or corridor could be included between the  
two to ensure no interference to the on-going research in the pri-  
mary areas.  
Primary office functions should be physically separated from  
the laboratory functions in accordance with Workplace Health  
and Safety guidelines. This ensures that laboratory activities are  
contained to areas where appropriate finishes, containment and air  
handling can be provided.  
Primary write-up functions may be incorporated into the pri-  
mary laboratory space subject to risk assessment in accordance with  
Workplace Health and Safety guidelines. Considerations for adja-  
cencies between the office/write-up and laboratory space include\:  
• Visibility/safety\: if processes are occurring in the laboratory  
that require viewing from a write-up space then laboratories and  
write-up should be directly adjacent to each other with good vis-  
ibility between.  
• Convenience\: if the user is writing up an experiment and con-  
ducting an experiment simultaneously then direct adjacency is  
desirable.  
• User preference\: if neither of the aforementioned applies, then  
this is a matter of user preference.  
Tertiary spaces do not always need to be close to the primary  
and secondary areas. Their location is a matter of preference and is  
determined through discussion with the stakeholders.  
Refer to Section 5 for a case study example that illustrates  
assembling primary, secondary and tertiary spaces for a biomed-  
ical facility. Data provided on this indicates the ratio of the areas  
relative to the gross floor plate as well as primary/secondary/ter-  
tiary split.  
# 3.5 Layout considerations  
• Views/wall space\: do the stakeholders want a view from their  
laboratories to the exterior or will the laboratories be located  
on the interior with wall space used for laboratory benches and  
equipment?  
• Light sensitivity\: some scientific methods do not require or  
cannot be exposed to natural light. Special instruments and  
equipment such as NMR apparatus, electron microscopes and  
lasers cannot function properly in natural light. These are typi-  
cally located in the interior of the building.  
• Shape of space\: regular and rectangular shapes are generally the  
most efficient for laboratories although in some instances the  
shape of a space can be dictated by the size of a specialist piece  
of equipment, such as a robotics rig. Irregularities on the perime-  
ter of a space will reduce the overall effective area.  
• Open/cellular laboratories\: in open plan laboratories, partitions  
should be used only where required for environmental, privacy  
or security reasons. This allows researchers to share not only  
the space itself but also the equipment, bench space and support  
staff. This format facilitates communication between scientists  
and makes the laboratory more easily adaptable for future needs.  
• Interaction/collaboration\: are the different spaces within the  
laboratory facility arranged so that the potential for formal and  
unplanned interaction is maximised. This is seen as important in  
promoting knowledge exchange among scientists.  
Table X shows the relative areas for primary, secondary and ter-  
tiary spaces in a laboratory facility.

GIA \(excluding plant rooms\) 100  
\* The ratio of secondary to primary space is in the range 40–70 per cent. It will depend,  
among other things, on the disposition of equipment between laboratory space and  
special instrument rooms.  
# 3.6 School laboratory spatial requirements  
The increased teaching of STEM subjects is increasingly affecting  
the design of science- and technology-driven spaces and linking  
them with information technology and design areas.  
*Primary school \(combined food/science/design and technology*  
*room\)*\: In primary schools shared practical spaces are provided where  
activities such as science, food and design and technology are taught.  
These specialist spaces would normally be provided with a sink,  
washable floor area and resources for simple ‘wet’ practical activities.  
For an example of a room layout, see Figure 25.9a. For space stand-  
ards refer to Building Bulletin 103\: Area guidelines for mainstream  
schools, DFE that guides and supports the associated Schedule of  
Accommodation \(SoA\) Tool \(BB 103, refer to Bibliography\).  
*Secondary school \(science laboratory\)*\: In secondary schools,  
the preferred layout is for laboratories to be planned as suites or  
clusters that are flexible enough to allow for group and individ-  
ual teaching. These spaces should integrate latest IT technologies  
to incorporate the teaching of design and engineering as well as  
durable finishes to allow for the teaching of ‘wet’ science. For  
an example of room layouts, see Figures 25.9b and 25.9c. Space  
standards in Tables XI, XII, XIV and XV are based on Building  
Bulletin 103\: Area guidelines for mainstream schools, DFE \(BB  
103, refer to Bibliography\).  
In addition to the aforementioned, each room will require a sci-  
ence preparation room and chemical store these are dependant on  
school size and area guidance is given in Building Bulletin 103.

# 3.7 Academic \(research\), government, private/corporate  
# laboratory spatial requirements  
Laboratory allocation may be driven by space per researcher \(e.g. biol-  
ogy and chemistry laboratories\) or by equipment needs \(e.g. analytical  
and engineering laboratories\) leading to greater variances between  
facilities. In this *Handbook*, the areas provided are based on space per  
researcher. Equipment-driven laboratories require individual consid-  
eration with the stakeholders on a project basis. Table XIII provides  
recommended average areas for laboratory workers/researchers in the  
academic \(research\) and government sectors.  
# Table XIII Table of average areas per person \(academic, government sectors\)

\* Add 2–3 m2 when a writing place is included in the laboratory area.  
Note\: While, for example, a biologist needs far less fume cup-  
board space than say a chemist, there is a significantly greater need  
for ancillary equipment such as refrigerators, incubators, centri-  
fuges and environmental rooms. The overall space requirements  
balance, for the purpose of flexibility, should be generic.  
Private/corporate sectors often have their own standards for  
space organisation. They typically use benchmarking to estimate  
the amount of space and benching to be provided to each researcher.  
Benchmarking can be an unreliable process in part because it is diffi-  
cult to acquire solid, relevant data. There is a very wide range between  
the minimum and maximum for commercial data which reflects the  
complexity of uses in laboratory environments \(e.g. US laboratories  
can range from 22.7–41.1 m2/person, net primary plus secondary  
space/researcher\). The areas provided in Table XIV are the guidelines  
adopted by a large UK private pharmaceutical company.

*General*  
• Corridors, stairs, lifts, ramps, holding and other balance areas must  
allow ease of movement of people, materials, waste and equipment  
in respect of access routes dimensions, configuration and doors.  
• Circulation should provide safe pedestrian egress from each  
individual laboratory and laboratory support space through an  
uncomplicated path of egress to the building exterior at grade.  
• Separation of workspace and circulation reduces the likelihood  
of accidents and eases the problem of escape from hazards.  
• Circulation should accommodate the preferred adjacencies  
identified for the relationships between primary, secondary and  
tertiary laboratory spaces.

Adjacencies with corridors can be organised with a single, two  
\(racetrack\) or a three-corridor scheme. There are a number of var-  
iations to organise each type; see Figures 25.10, 25.11 and 25.12. **25-12 Laboratories**  
**25.10** *Plan layout illustrating a single-corridor arrangement. This layout is efficient; however, the single circulation route may result*  
*in material/people flow cross-over and conflict*

equipment rooms to accommodate the periodic movement of  
equipment. This can be accomplished using an opening with a  
900 mm active leaf and a 300 mm inactive leaf. Future equipment  
should be anticipated and equipment lists reviewed to verify that  
individual pieces of equipment can be transported and manoeu-  
vred between spaces.

# 3.9 Escape  
Under the Building Regulations 2000 Approved Document B  
\(AD B\) Volume 2 \(2019 edition\), although laboratories are not  
explicitly referenced they are commonly considered under the  
same purpose group as an office whereby the maximum distance  
where travel is possible in more than one direction is 45 m, and  
18 m if travel is possible in one direction only \(Figure 25.15\).  
The Building Regulations also stipulates a variation to this of  
18 m travel distances where travel is possible in more than one  
direction, while 9 m if in one direction only for areas with uses  
defining them as ‘Places of Special Fire Hazard’. Additionally,  
BS 9999\:2017 – *Code of practice for fire safety in the design,*  
*management and use of buildings* offers alternative design solu-  
tions for fire escape provisions. Guidance is given on how the  
prescriptive requirements of AD B can be relaxed using fire engi-  
neering principles.  
Where a piece of equipment in a laboratory which could be the  
source of a health hazard \(such as a fume cupboard exploding\) is  
located within an escape route, it is recommended that an alterna-  
tive route be allowed for in the design. In addition to this, if gas  
cylinders are required within a laboratory, they should be securely  
fixed in a position away from any escape route or final exit; see  
Figure 25.16.

*Alternative means of escape where potential sources of*  
# 3.10 Lifts  
The service lift also often doubles up as access to the plant room  
for items of plant. Engineers will typically ask for a lift with the  
capacity to take a 2 m cube \(minimum\) to allow items of air han-  
dling equipment to be dismantled and taken down in the lift, and  
this would generally be a suitable size to accommodate most large  
equipment in a laboratory, for example, a −80°C freezer or an item  
of furniture. Specific requirements should be confirmed with the  
stakeholder.  
# 3.11 Furniture\: general concepts  
Laboratories should be designed to allow relocation of furniture  
within the limits of the modular configuration. Particular reference  
is made to the selection of laboratory benching and storage systems  
and the distribution of services systems. Performance criteria to  
consider when selecting laboratory benching include\:  
*Modularity*  
• Modular lengths \(typically in increments of 1000 mm for UK  
furniture manufacturers and 600, 900 or 1200 mm for other  
European manufacturers\), depths and heights  
• Pre-installation services  
• Prefabrication of furniture  
• Provision of interchangeable components and accessories  
*Flexibility*  
• Flexible and adaptable systems that can be readily moved, repo-  
sitioned with little or no impact on the building structure and  
finishes and with minimum disruption to the end user  
• Height adjustable bench and laboratory chair is recommended  
where possible \(subject to budget and requirements for vibration  
control and cleanliness\)  
• Services distribution independent from the laboratory furniture  
with service pick-up points from ceiling, walls or pods  
• Under bench and overhead storage systems independent of labo-  
ratory furniture, movable and readily relocatable  
• Vibration \(where sensitive microscopes are used, anti-vibration  
tables should be considered\).  
# Laboratories 25-15  
*Maintenance*  
• Ease of cleaning and maintenance and ease of access for service  
and maintenance purposes  
• Robustness.  
*Equality Act \(EA\) requirements*  
• Provide height adjustable furniture where possible to accommo-  
date various equipment and EA requirements.  
• Provide at least one EA compliant workstation/write-up area  
for each laboratory unit and in accordance with stakeholder  
requirements.  
*Finishes*  
Work surfaces should in general be impervious and readily clean-  
able and where required chemically resistant. Commonly used  
materials are laminate faced boards, stainless steel faced boards,  
solid timber sheets, laminated timber sheets, solid laminate sheets,  
solid epoxy resin sheets, solid phenolic resin sheets and acrylic  
polymer sheets. The most appropriate of these will depend on the  
materials and chemicals being used, and cost parameters for each  
laboratory bench.  
*Bench length, depth and height \(primary schools\)*  
As science is undertaken in a multi-functioning area around clus-  
ters of tables, perimeter benching or a combination of the two and  
limited to groups of eight children, the only critical dimension in  
planning such a space is to ensure wheelchair access to key facili-  
ties within it; see Table XVIII and Figure 25.17.

*Bench length, depth and height \(secondary schools\)*  
Preferably, some benching needs to be reconfigurable to accom-  
modate new teaching methods; see Table XIX and Figure 25.18.  
*Bench length, depth and height \(higher education*  
*and research\)*  
Benching requirements are often no longer based on each researcher  
having an allocated place but are utilised by groups undertaking a  
specific project; see Table XX and Figure 25.19.  
# 3.12 Storage  
*General concepts*  
• Centrally located storage rather than local is preferred \(for ease  
of maintenance, avoiding duplication, diversity and more intense  
use of equipment\)  
• Storage depth and height dimensions should be based on con-  
venient reach  
• Modular \(based on industry standard sizes where possible\)  
• Movable/adjustable  
• Robust.  
*Convenient reach*  
Comfortable reach into a 300–500 mm deep cupboard above floor  
level is as follows \(Table XXI and Figure 25.20\).  
*Cupboard depth and height*  
The depth of storage cupboards should be from 300 to 500 mm for  
ease of access and fit with bench top and rail; see Figure 25.21. The

\* Suitable length will depend upon the amount of bench-mounted equipment.  
2000 mm is a good starting point. Exceptional cases include benchmark allowances  
made in private/corporate sectors.  
\*\* Certain operations and pieces of equipment may require a greater bench depth. These  
need to be identified early in the briefing process and are generally accommodated on  
double depth peninsular benches. 750 mm is a good median figure.  
\*\*\* Increases to 850 mm for Equality Act compliance.

tend to be used for dead storage \(Table XXII and Figure 25.22\)  
*Underbench storage*  
Underbench storage is generally provided in three ways, namely  
mobile \(on castors or glides\), suspended units \(supported above  
# Laboratories 25-17  
**25.21** *Storage depths based on convenient reach*  
the floor off furniture frame\) and plinth mounted \(floor standing\);  
see Figure 25.23. The location and number of these need to meet  
functional requirements allowing sufficient gaps where anyone will  
be working seated. Movable units \(i.e. mobile or suspended\) are  
recommended where cleaning around, ease of maintenance and  
relocating of storage units in areas are seen as important. In an ideal  
situation, space occupied by underbench units should not exceed 50  
per cent of the underbench space.  
*Gas cylinder storage*  
The mechanical engineering consultant will be primarily respon-  
sible for defining gas cylinder storage requirements; however, the  
following should be considered\:  
• Local standards and regulations \(refer to Bibliography\)  
• Types of gas required and whether they are to be temporarily  
stored for later transportation or permanently stored for piping  
to their locations  
• Gas store proximities, cylinder separation for different gas types,  
explosion proofing/venting/fire rating, accessibility for delivery  
lorry to refill dewar/s  
• Pipework distribution routes, venting, proximity to electrical  
services  
• Leak detection and alert systems including links to fire alarm/  
building management system \(BMS\)/shut-off at manifold and  
laboratory  
• Electrical equipment in store and laboratory  
• Ventilation equipment in laboratory  
• Gas supplier to the facility  
• Facility representative responsible for the above. **25-18 Laboratories**  
*Liquid nitrogen storage*  
If the fill point is located internally, continuous ventilation and an  
oxygen level detection system linked to the BMS will be required.  
Ideally, store externally, located against a fire rated external wall.  
This requires no specialist venting. The only requirement for an  
external fill point would be a secured lightweight lean-to-roof  
arrangement, to protect it from the elements. In areas where liq-  
uid nitrogen is being transferred between containers, care should be  
taken in the selection of floor and wall finishes as contact with liquid  
nitrogen can lead to their rapid deterioration due to thermal shock.  
# 3.13 Equipment  
*General concepts*  
Space allocation is dependent on individual requirements which are  
subject to change. Utilise removable or relocatable equipment in prefer-  
ence to purpose-built fixed facilities where possible. Ideally, laboratory  
benching should be removable to allow floor standing equipment to be  
incorporated as required during the life of the laboratory.  
*General equipment*  
Confirmation with manufacturers is necessary as individual sizes  
vary considerably depending on capacity and make. General/stand-  
ard floor standing equipment may include items noted in what  
follows \(indicative sizes are shown\).  
• Under bench fridge/freezer 600 w × 600 d × 650−875h  
• Tall/floor standing fridge/freezer 600−750 w × 600−750 d × 1800h  
• −50° to −80° freezer 900 w × 900 d × 1990h  
• Centrifuge 900−1200 w × 900 d × 950h  
• Oven 1000 w × 1000 d × 800h  
Note\: large storage freezers, typically −80°C, should be located  
within designated freezer rooms which will provide sufficient noise  
attenuation and local cooling also reducing energy usage.  
*Special equipment*  
Special equipment may include\:  
• NMR  
• X-ray and other imaging equipment  
• IT equipment  
• Balances and other measuring equipment  
• Mass spectrometers  
• Autoclaves.  
Room dimensions, structural loading, rigidity and resonance,  
environmental conditions, wave and particle shielding and services  
connections for special equipment require individual consideration  
and therefore should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and must  
**25.24** *Fume cupboard minimum distances for avoiding disturbances to the fume cupboard and its operator \(as stipulated in BS7258\)* **Laboratories 25-19**  
take full account of manufacturer’s and health and safety require-  
ments. Where equipment that is affected by magnetic fields is being  
considered, care should be taken to check their proximity to mov-  
ing metal objects such as lifts.  
*Local exhaust ventilation \(LEVs\)*  
A LEV is a ventilation system that takes dusts, mists, gases, vapour  
or fumes out of the air so that they cannot be breathed in. The  
Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations require  
prevention or adequate control of exposure to hazardous sub-  
stances. Where the risk assessment determines that local exhaust  
ventilation is required as part of the control measures employed,  
the LEV must be suitably selected, used, tested and maintained and  
appropriate records kept. A LEV may be tiny and built into a hand-  
held tool or it may be large enough to walk into, such as a fume  
cupboard \(described in more detail next\).  
*Fume cupboards*  
BS EN 14175 Parts 1 to 7 represents the most recent fume cupboard  
standard and partially supersedes the previous standard, BS 7258. BS  
EN 14175 includes types of fume cupboard not previously covered  
by BS 7258, such as walk-ins, VAV, horizontal sashes and low cill  
cabinets. It is more of a product standard and is relatively weak with  
reference to placement requirements. BS EN 14175 puts greater onus  
on individual testing by manufacturers to justify the performance of  
their cupboard. It is hoped that as more tests are published greater  
guidance will become available on locating them. Reference to ele-  
ments of BS 7258 could be considered as a safe starting point.  
All fume cupboards \(FCs\) setting out should give optimum protec-  
tion to the user working with chemicals/aerosols. Single person FCs  
are generally 1500–1800 mm long. Larger standard units, generally  
for two persons, are up to 2400 mm long. They should be positioned to  
avoid disturbances to the cupboard and its operator; see Figures 25.24  
**25.25** *Fume cupboard planning arrangements for avoiding disturbances to the fume cupboard and its operator and from other*  
*personnel \(as stipulated in BS7258\)* **25-20 Laboratories**  
**25.26** *Microbiological safety cabinet minimum distances for avoiding disturbances to the cabinet and its operator*  
and 25.25. Disturbances include people walking parallel to it, open  
windows, air supply registers or laboratory equipment that creates air  
movement such as, for example, vacuum pumps and centrifuges. They  
should be located away from high traffic areas, doors and air supply/  
exhaust grilles that may interrupt airflow patterns. There should be an  
alternative means of escape in the event of an explosion/fire.  
The use of recirculating FCs \(non-ducted\) can greatly reduce  
energy consumption although the cupboard usage may be limited.  
Before selecting a recirculating fume cupboard, a review of the  
chemicals being used within needs to be undertaken to ensure its  
filter is able to maintain a safe working environment. Refer to BS  
7989 specification for recirculatory filtration FCs. Recirculating  
and relocatable FCs with flexible ducting and variable extract are  
recommended for maximising flexibility and minimising energy con-  
sumption. The suitability of these should be confirmed with users.  
*Microbiological safety cabinets*  
The setting out of all microbiological safety cabinets \(MSCs\) should  
comply with BS 5726 and EN 12469 to give optimum protection to  
the user working with biological agents up to Hazard Group 4. Single  
person safety cabinets are generally 1300–1800 mm long. Larger  
standard units, generally for two persons, are up to 2400 mm long.  
They should be positioned to avoid disturbances to the cup-  
board and its operator; see Figures 25.26 and 25.27. Disturbances  
include people walking parallel to it, open windows, air supply  
registers or laboratory equipment that creates air movement such  
as, for example, vacuum pumps and centrifuges. They should be  
located away from high traffic areas, doors and air supply/exhaust  
grilles that may interrupt airflow patterns.  
All MSCs are designed to comply with one of the three classifi-  
cations defined in BS EN 12469\:  
• A Class I safety cabinet provides a wide performance envelope  
for the user from aerosol hazards and other particulates within the  
cabinet’s work area. All extract air is exhausted through HEPA  
\(high efficient particulate air\) filtration generally to atmosphere.  
Recirculating MSCs are also available though the usage of these  
is dependent on the work being undertaken within them.  
• A Class II safety cabinet, unlike the Class I safety cabinet,  
provides protection to both the user and the material within  
the cabinet’s working area. Protection for the user is provided  
by means of an advanced inflow air curtain while the sample  
material in the cabinet is protected from the dirty laboratory  
environment by a constant stream of HEPA filtered air.  
• A Class III safety cabinet, like the Class II safety cabinet, pro-  
vides protection for both the user and product but with a higher  
degree of protection than a Class II cabinet. For the user, this  
is achieved by means of an additional barrier such as working  
through gloves or gauntlets and protection to the material within  
the cabinet by means of the filtered supply air operating at a  
negative pressure to the surrounding environment and with the  
exhaust air being vented through a HEPA filter to atmosphere. **Laboratories 25-21**  
**25.27** *Microbiological safety cabinet planning arrangements for avoiding disturbances to the cabinet and its operator and from other*  
*personnel*  
A Class III microbiological safety cabinet is a highly specialised  
product designed for the most hazardous work, typically carried  
out in a Containment Level 3 or 4 facility.  
Some manufacturers also produce a hybrid Class I/III cabinet but  
this is not described within the British Standard. The hybrid, as the  
name suggests, can be used as either a Class I or a Class III cabinet  
by the use of a removable port that attaches to the front aperture.  
However, the construction and testing of these cabinets is such that  
when used in Class III mode it is not equivalent to the specification  
of a standard Class III cabinet and should always be checked.  
Both BS EN 12469 and the Advisory Committee for Dangerous  
Pathogens \(ACDP\) recommend that natural gas should not be used  
with the cabinet \(as this will have an impact on the cabinet’s air-  
flow, the down flow filter integrity and could possibly prove to be a  
fire hazard – several cabinets have been set alight this way\), as such  
this should not be offered as a standard fixture on the Class II MSC.  
If, after a risk assessment, it is deemed necessary to have natural  
gas, then a special gas solenoid type tap together with a low profile,  
foot-operated ignition type burner should be used. The number of  
cabinets required should be confirmed with stakeholders.  
# 3.14 Finishes and fittings  
*Finishes*  
Finishes should be suitable to the relevant usage, containment level  
and cleanroom classification for the laboratory. For general wet chem-  
ical and biological laboratories and darkrooms, a solvent resistant,  
slip-resistant and coved vinyl or rubber flooring using sheet goods  
rather than tile is recommended. Walls and ceilings should be robust  
and cleanable. Generally, a fully accessible suspended ceiling instal-  
lation \(where containment/cleanroom classifications do not require  
it to be fully sealed\) will allow full access to above ceiling services  
infrastructure and allow some acoustic treatment to the space, though  
in some spaces no ceiling at all can be more appropriate. Refer to the  
Bibliography for further references on finishes’ specification.  
*Handwashing sinks*  
Handwashing sinks are typically required for each laboratory and  
should be located near the point of exit from the laboratory or in  
the anteroom. Handwashing sinks for particularly hazardous chem-  
icals or biological agents may need elbow \(for Containment Level  
2 areas\) or electronic sensor controls \(for Containment Level 3  
areas\). **25-22 Laboratories**  
*Emergency eyewash and safety shower facilities*  
Laboratories using hazardous materials must have an emergency  
eyewash and safety shower ideally located in the corridor, close  
to and highly visible from the laboratory exits and within a nomi-  
nal ten seconds’ travel time from the chemical use areas or current  
Workplace Health and Safety Requirements \(whichever is most  
stringent\). Eyewashes and safety showers should preferably have  
plumbed drains, they should be conspicuously labelled and flooring  
under safety showers should be slip-resistant. Safety showers may  
have privacy curtains, particularly in large laboratories or teaching  
laboratories.  
# 3.15 Services requirements  
Systems must deliver laboratory services suitable for the accurate  
and reliable conduct of research procedures, conforming to rele-  
vant standards and codes of practice and satisfying specific criteria,  
in respect of parameters, including\:  
• Composition  
• Purity  
• Stability and reliability \(e.g. temperature, pressure, uninterrupti-  
ble power supply \(UPS\), flow rate\)  
• Control of delivery.  
A well-controlled system will provide flexibility and minimise  
the operational cost of the building. Considerations should include\:  
• Expansion space allowed in the utility corridors, ceilings and  
vertical chases for future HVAC, plumbing and electric needs  
• Easy connects/disconnects at walls and ceilings to allow for fast  
and affordable hook up of equipment  
• Modular distribution.  
# 3.16 Power  
Three types of power are generally used for most laboratory pro-  
jects. Requirements should be confirmed with stakeholders during  
the briefing phase.  
*Normal power*\: Circuits are connected to the utility supply only,  
without any backup system. Loads that are typically on normal  
power include some HVAC equipment, general lighting and most  
laboratory equipment.  
*Standby power*\: Depending on the size or height of the building,  
standby power, which is created with generators, may be required  
for life safety systems \(e.g. smoke control systems, sprinkler  
pumps, firefighter’s lift, car park extract, etc.\). Standby power may  
also be necessary from a business continuity/loss of product point  
of view in the event of a normal power cut-off \(e.g. power to plant  
servicing critical temperature rooms, maintaining pressure to con-  
tainment or clean room applications, power to sump and sewage  
pumps, extract systems for radioactive areas, etc.\).  
*Uninterruptible power supply \(UPS\)*\: UPS is required to  
condition and maintain uninterrupted power to critical loads  
for data recording, certain computers and micro-processor con-  
trolled equipment and selected bench outlets where long running  
experiments may be connected. The UPS can be either a central  
unit or a portable system depending on extent of requirement,  
cost and space constraints. UPS systems are very expensive and  
therefore careful consideration is necessary when defining their  
rating.  
*Load*\: Connected electrical loads are anticipated loads estimated  
during the briefing phase. The loads provided in Table XXIII are  
indicative to assist with preliminary sizing of a generic bench-scale  
laboratory building.  
# 3.17 Services distribution  
The method of distributing services to furniture and equipment has  
a major influence on the flexibility of layout possible during the  
laboratory’s total life. There are three \(one may be used in two  
ways\) main methods of distributing services \(power, data, gas,  
water\) to laboratory benching and equipment. This allows furniture  
to be arranged in peninsular/perimeter and/or island configurations;  
see Figures 25.28 to 25.31.  
• Overhead \(fixed services\)  
• Overhead \(flexible services\)  
• Perimeter \(on walls\)  
• Under floor.  
Where services are integral to the furniture, equipment and  
partitions, any major change in layout will involve adaptation  
or extension of the service runs. If, however, the distribution of  
services within the laboratory can be separated and flexible connec-  
tions made to loose services units, layouts can be adjusted directly  
by stakeholders to meet new requirements.  
The greatest flexibility can be achieved by providing flexible  
services delivery to point of use from movable ceiling pods and  
bench-mounted masts connected to a ceiling services infrastruc-  
ture via flexible hose connections and flying electrical leads; see  
Figure 25.29. This is achieved through the use of fully relocata-  
ble services integrated with the ceiling and laboratory furniture  
and equipment. This approach requires full design coordination  
and consultation with the mechanical, electrical and piping  
engineers.

**25.29** *Overhead flexible services distribution* **25.30** *Perimeter services distribution through walls and trunking*  
**25.31** *Distribution of services through floor mounted bollards*  
*Power and data services outlets*\: Utilise accessible trunking  
that can readily accommodate the future addition and subtraction  
of outlets as required. Extension leads should be avoided for health  
and safety reasons.  
Socket outlets should not be placed immediately adjacent to  
sinks where splashing could present a risk \(refer to BS7 671\).  
The number of outlets required should be confirmed with stake-  
holders and the services engineers. An indicative guide \(typically  
maximum\) for generically designed laboratories is as follows\:  
• Double power at 450 mm centres/bench and equipment run  
• Double data at 900 mm centres/bench and equipment run.  
Cleaners’ sockets should be provided and clearly identified to  
avoid cleaners’ equipment interfering with active experiments/lab-  
oratory equipment.  
*Piped services*\: Laboratory piped services should be delivered  
to each laboratory on a modular basis \(even though all services  
may not be initially required in all laboratories\) for flexibility and  
to minimise remodel and retrofit costs as laboratory use changes.  
Each laboratory unit should have separate shut-off valves located  
in a consistent, accessible manner for repairs or emergency shut-  
off without affecting other laboratories. Except for waste and vent  
systems, distribution systems are recommended to be looped.  
Initially, the frequency and quality requirements should be  
assessed. Where demand is intermittent or a particular quality is  
required, localised sources may be provided.  
# Laboratories 25-23  
Basic requirements include\:  
• Potable water, hot and cold \(HW, CW\)  
• Industrial water, hot and cold \(IHW, ICW\).

# 4 ENVIRONMENT  
# 4.1 General  
The typical laboratory uses far more energy and water per square  
metre than the typical office building due to intensive ventilation  
requirements and other health and safety concerns. Therefore,  
designers should strive to create sustainable, high performance and  
low-energy laboratories that will minimise overall environmental  
impacts and optimise whole building efficiency on a life-cycle  
basis.  
Systems must, however, maintain background environments  
suitable for the accurate and reliable conduct of research procedures  
satisfying criteria for each accommodation type, in respect of\:  
• Temperature  
• Relative humidity  
• Ventilation rates \(air change rate, heat loads, equipment extract\)  
• Room pressurisation  
• Control and variation of environmental parameters.  
# 4.2 Design criteria  
*Temperature*  
The recommended temperature values listed in Table XXV for  
laboratory and laboratory support spaces are generally accept-  
able; however, individual requirements should be confirmed  
with stakeholders. Natural ventilation and higher or lower val-  
ues may be specified depending on laboratory containment/  
cleanroom classification, type of activity, equipment and per-  
sonnel clothing.

20° min \(22 +/−2°C\)  
20° min \(22 +/−2°C\) **25-24 Laboratories**  
*Relative humidity \(RH\)*  
Requirements should be confirmed with stakeholders. Humidity  
lower than 30 per cent can cause electrostatic effects, and RH  
above 50 per cent can augment oxidation and corrosion. RH  
is more difficult to regulate than temperature. Reducing the RH  
as low as 40 per cent is possible with standard cooling methods.  
Dehumidification below this level requires expensive desiccating  
equipment. Fluctuation ranges below +/−2 per cent are difficult to  
achieve and maintain and are very expensive.  
*Ventilation rates*  
*Air change rate*\: Typical air changes per hour \(ac/hr\) for laboratory  
and laboratory support spaces are 6–10 ac/hr depending on the use  
and individual requirements.  
*Heat loads*\: Heat loads from laboratory equipment for each  
space are calculated during the design stage for each project. The  
specific laboratory heat loads shown in Table XXVI are based  
on anticipated loads for generic research scale laboratories and  
are provided to assist with the preliminary sizing of the building  
systems.  
*Equipment extract rates*\: Schedules should be developed for  
each space during briefing of each project. The extract schedule  
\(Table XXVII\) is provided to assist with the preliminary sizing of  
the building systems.  
# Table XXVI Preliminary heat gain from laboratory equipment \(indicative loads\)

Fume cupboard 0.30–0.50  
MSC 0.15  
Equipment vent 0.02–0.04  
Snorkel 0.07–0.1  
*Room pressurisation*\: For environments requiring containment,  
relative pressure to surroundings is typically negative, principally  
for the containment of hazards and smells. For cleanroom envi-  
ronments, relative pressure to surroundings is typically positive,  
principally for the control of dust/particles into the room.  
*Lighting design*\: Lighting levels should not be less than  
Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers \(CIBSE\) rec-  
ommendations. The illumination levels recommended for general  
laboratories \(performance of visual tasks of medium contrast or  
small size\) are 350 lux generally, 500 lux on the working plane.  
Consider local task lighting to reduce overall illumination levels.  
Good to high colour rendering should be considered in laboratory  
areas. Emergency lighting needs to comply with BS EN 62305.  
*Acoustics*\: The recommendation for background noise levels in  
general laboratories is NR 45. Noise control methods include the  
use of acoustically lined enclosures and reduced sound level oper-  
ating equipment. Silencers may be used in air distribution systems  
within the materials and constraints available. Duct liners should  
be avoided.  
*Control and variation of environmental parameters*\: Where  
economically viable and without compromising the functional-  
ity of the research environment, stakeholders should be allowed  
limited control over their immediate environment including tem-  
perature and lighting. Consider natural ventilation to the offices and  
any atria/light-wells.

# 5.1 Introduction  
Collaborative Teaching Laboratory \(CTL\), Figure 25.32, for  
the University of Birmingham introduces a new approach to  
undergraduate teaching laboratories by creating ultra-flexible,  
multi-functional spaces for numerous STEM disciplines to work  
side-by-side.  
The strategic brief for the project was to deliver a new teach-  
ing facility to be shared by 14 different undergraduate science and  
engineering departments. This brief was then developed to consider  
the benefits such a co-location could bring in terms of interdiscipli-  
nary collaboration.  
**25.32** *CLT teaching laboratories*  
# 5.2 Design approach  
The layout of the building is simple – three floors with one ‘super  
lab’ on each floor, flanked by collaborative learning space and united  
via the triple storey discovery space. This is reflected in the external  
massing of the building. On the north and west elevations, the large  
‘wet’ laboratory is expressed as a metal clad box, with the ‘dry’  
and ‘e-labs’ expressed via bespoke trapezoidal glazing orientated  
to optimise daylight. A plinth built in dark bricks with simple, full  
height punched windows unite these functions visually, and a strik-  
ing mirror clad bridge links to the adjacent Biosciences building.  
# 5.3 Facilities  
*Wet Laboratory*\: the 180-person capacity wet laboratory is split  
into two zones, an 80-person open bench zone for use of flexible  
equipment and rig experiments and a 100-person capacity student  
bench zone supported by shared fume cupboard facilities. The  
racetrack circulation design breaks down the student capacities  
into groups of 20 to provide intimate teaching groups supported  
by an integrated digital laboratory strategy. The design followed an  
open plan concept where cellular rooms were minimised and only  
included where a technical or safety aspect dictated.  
*Dry Laboratory*\: the 170-person capacity dry laboratory is an  
ultra-flexible layout which allows reconfiguration around a series of service spines. The flexibility of laboratory enables both focused and  
larger format work to be undertaken simultaneously. The space is  
supported by considered storage solutions which cater for the diverse  
range of occupants, from geologists through to electrical engineers.  
*E-Laboratory*\: the 204 seat IT enabled laboratory facilities pre  
and post laboratory activity. The laboratory offers an integrated lab  
book approach to planning, testing and write-up maximising the  
# Laboratories 25-25  
use of the traditional laboratories. The laboratory also offers tradi-  
tional teaching formats.  
*Back of house areas*\: the high-volume laboratories are sup-  
ported by a central back of house model with satellite preparation.  
This enables efficient use of the floor plate for collaborative self-di-  
rected learning environments central to the primary laboratories.  
Adjacencies of key spaces are shown in Figure 25.33.  
**25.33** *Collaborative Teaching Laboratory \(CTL\) – floor plans and section* **25-26 Laboratories**  
# 5.4 Furniture and fittings  
The furniture within the wet laboratory is double width island  
benching with single sided perimeter benching. Where possible  
all storage is mobile to support student ownership of undergrad-  
uate glassware needs. The dry laboratory accommodates a mobile  
strategy of a single bench per two students with a fixed spine. The  
e-laboratory provides octagon island benching with ergonomic  
adjusted screens enabling group discussions.  
# 5.5 Sustainability  
In accordance with the University of Birmingham’s plans for car-  
bon reduction, a clear sustainability ethos was embedded into the  
brief. The project adopted a fabric first approach, ensuring high  
performance of the façade and its detailing. Secondly, operational  
aspects of the building were reviewed, and parameters were estab-  
lished which enabled high levels of controllability and metering.  
The project achieved a BREEAM ‘Excellent’ rating and received  
an RIBA Sustainability Award.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Changing role of the library  
The evolving role of the library has created a set of new and com-  
plex challenges for those delivering library buildings and services.  
The libraries of the twenty-first century are no longer simply  
familiar repositories for books with space for reading and lending.  
They have changed and expanded, been rethought and redesigned.  
Libraries now provide an increasingly wide range of services, using  
a multitude of media, and reach a more diverse audience than ever  
before; see Table I and Figure 26.1.  
# Table I Library types  
• New information technology and new forms of electronic data exchange  
• Greater social, community and educational role for public libraries  
• Expansion in types and diversity of education, including life-long learning, has  
undermined the exclusivity of public libraries  
• Impact of mass culture and new social media  
• Impact of environmental sustainability on the design of libraries  
# Main types of library Key features  
National library • National collections of books, journals, maps etc.  
• Research focused  
• Conservation element  
• Specialist readership  
Public library • Collections of books and CDs primarily for loan  
• Place to meet and exchange  
• Wide range of material of local interest  
• Community base for local people  
• Integration with other ‘cultural’ or civic buildings  
Academic library • Support for teaching, learning and research  
• Place where new knowledge is generated and exchanged  
• Large specialist and research collections  
• Separate IT and multi-media areas  
• 24 hour access  
Professional and special • Specialist collection of books and professional journals  
libraries • Often contains rare or fragile non-paper material  
• Limited public access  
• Conservation element  
One trend is towards social or public functions rather than  
merely library ones on the ground floor. Such public functions  
may include cafes, bookshops, exhibition areas, meeting rooms,  
community and welfare offices. The library then rises from this  
welcoming community base. Many academic libraries follow a  
similar model with student, welfare and registry facilities linked to  
printing, binding, bookshops and cafes on the entrance level with  
the main library spaces above. With such plans, noise abatement  
may be required and careful zoning to ensure security of the col-  
lection.  
Some argue that libraries of the future will be without books.  
Such buildings will be knowledge markets, open to all without  
security barriers, and freely engaged in social exchanges of vari-  
ous kinds from learning to networking, using ever advancing IT to  
expand human knowledge and creative potential. Recent examples  
include the bookless public library at San Antonio, Texas and the  
paperless academic library at the School of Engineering, Stanford  
University. However, books are likely to remain in most libraries  
but take an increasingly back seat in this fast evolving building  
type. Surviving books are likely to have sentimental or archival  
interest rather than be the first point of contact for readers.  
As libraries broaden their social and educational role to become  
‘ideas stores’ and ‘knowledge gateways’, there is pressure to  
increase the extent of non-library accommodation within their  
walls. The problem for the architect is how to bring the library and  
non-library functions into a coherent whole \(see Table II\).  
# 1.2 Revival of the library  
After years of relative neglect as a building type, the public library  
enjoyed a renaissance towards the end of the twentieth century.  
This was partly the result of new information technologies chal-  
lenging the supremacy of the book and other forms of paper-based  
media. The IT revolution highlighted the important social, edu-  
cational and cultural role of library buildings, particularly to the  
life and welfare of cities. CABE in particular was instrumental in  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-29 **26-1** **26-2 Libraries**  
pushing forward a vision for more inclusive and dynamic public  
libraries. Under pressure from CABE and in response to wider  
social changes in Britain’s cities, interesting new solutions to the  
architecture of the public library appeared in London’s Watney  
Market, Whitechapel and Peckham as well as at Worcester,  
Norwich, Brighton and more recently in Birmingham, where  
Mecanoo’s new public library opened in 2013 \(see Section 8 Case  
study\). Although the pace of change has slowed under economic  
pressures in much of Europe, the USA, China and Canada are  
building a clutch of interesting new libraries that integrate media  
and promote cultural solidarity.  
The university library too has undergone considerable change as  
the emphasis shifts from libraries as storehouses of knowledge to  
places where new knowledge is generated and existing knowledge  
\(whether digital or paper\) is openly shared in teaching, learning  
and research. Examples of a fresh approach to the design of aca-  
demic libraries are found at the Saltire Centre, Glasgow Caledonia  
University, designed by BDP, new libraries at the Open University  
by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, Leicester University by  
Associated Architects and at Aberdeen University by Schmidt  
Hammer Lassen. Many extensions to existing university libraries  
as at Liverpool, East Anglia and Portsmouth Universities provide  
space for IT and new forms of media to augment older book-based  
provision. These areas, known sometimes as ‘Learning Commons’,  
reflect the change in pedagogy from lecture-based teaching to  
student-focused open learning based on course work rather than  
examination. Useful examples can be sourced on the SCONUL  
journal *Focus* and the *Designing Libraries* website.  
Outside the UK, there has also been new thinking on the design  
and civic purpose of library buildings with OMA’s public library in  
Seattle, the Snøhetta designed library in Alexandria, Egypt and that  
by Patkau Architects in Montreal being notable examples. Across  
Europe, there has also been much new building of university librar-  
ies to meet the expansion in higher education including the Free  
University Berlin by Foster & Partners and Brandenburg Technical  
University by Herzog and de Meuron. The libraries of universities  
in particular have had to adjust to new pedagogic practices as well  
as a revolution in the form and use of knowledge.  
# 1.3 A place to meet  
Today the library, whether public or academic, is a place to meet,  
discover, learn and exchange information within welcoming, light  
and airy surroundings, Figures 26.2, 26.3. Libraries come in many  
shapes and forms. Generally, there are four main types but within  
each, there is much variability. One trend is towards bigger librar-  
ies whether faculty or community based. Large scale provides the  
basis for better integration of book and digital media, of providing a  
wider range of support services \(computer training, language skills,  
networking skills\) as well as more extensive non-reader facilities  
\(café, exhibition areas, shop\).  
It is important that libraries are well designed from a civic point  
of view, providing an architectural response which is welcoming,  
inclusive and offers a range of services able to attract young people  
as well as old, locals and new residents, whether IT literate or not.  
Today’s libraries therefore need to provide a variety of different  
types of space to serve these different users. Although small librar-  
ies are good at community engagement, large ones are increasingly  
favoured since they serve the needs of readers, business and educa-  
tion on a regional basis.  
# 2 COMMUNITY ROLE OF LIBRARIES  
# 2.1 New functions for libraries  
The revival of interest in the library as a building type has three  
main roots. First, new media technologies, particularly IT-based  
knowledge packages and new ways of communicating \(Facebook  
and Twitter\) have led government and university clients to reas-  
sess the role and design of libraries in a digital age. Second, the  
resurgence of interest in other cultural building types – notably  
the museum and art gallery – encouraged many public clients and  
their architects to see libraries as buildings to visit in their own  
right rather than merely providing access to books, journals and IT  
services. Third, the expansion of universities worldwide led to a  
re-assessment of the role of the academic library in teaching, learn-  
ing and research, and this in turn influenced the design of public  
libraries.

**26.3** *Level 3 plan of The Hive public library in Worcester, designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios Key\: 1\) Library/study, 2\) Quiet*  
*study, 3\) Social learning*  
As a result of these changes, libraries have become inclusive  
and inviting buildings where their transparency acts as a lighthouse  
of knowledge in many towns and on many campuses. Once inside  
these new libraries, the spaces are animated by the sound of knowl-  
edge use, knowledge sharing and social discourse. However, not  
all is noisy\: new libraries have had to zone their spaces to meet  
different types of knowledge use and to serve the needs of different  
users.  
The twenty-first-century library is typically a building with  
exciting external public spaces, interesting architectural forms  
and a more ‘market place’ interior quality. Attention is paid to  
urban design as well as building design, to the creation of read-  
ing rooms which invite contemplation, reflection and exchange  
across media types and between readers, and to the provision of  
exhibition, café and bookshop areas. Libraries have changed from  
being mainly depositories of books, newspapers and journals to  
being multi-media knowledge centres playing an active role in the  
modern digital age. Today the typical library \(see Tables III and  
IV\) is an interactive network of spaces which encompass books  
for loan, journals \(many of which are electronic\), CDs, videos,  
internet sources and special study collections. Increasingly the  
network contains links to the home and educational centres,  
thereby supporting learning and reinforcing the role of schools,  
colleges and universities in the community. This expanded role  
has been accompanied by a change in design values, the job  
description of librarians and a broadening of the brief of a typical  
library.  
# Table IV CABE’s summary of public library trends  
• Each library will develop its own bespoke range of services  
• Libraries will develop in partnership with other services  
• Adaptability is a key factor in layout and design  
• Reader development, communication and literacy skill are central library services  
• Libraries will become communication centres for mobile populations  
• Long stay use of libraries for study requires friendly and efficient support facilities  
• Electronic links between homes and libraries will increase  
• Children’s services will grow in importance  
• Virtual library services will be provided 24 hours a day  
• Librarians will change their role from custodians of culture to knowledge navigators

Rather than lead to the obsolescence of the library, new technol-  
ogy has liberated the library from increasingly unpopular stereotypical  
forms, and altered the fundamental assumptions behind their design.  
One such is the requirement for silence in all but designated areas.  
The strategy today is to encourage the sharing of knowledge and to  
welcome the use of the spoken word either between individuals or  
in groups. Since the library is often used for teaching and learning  
within the community, silence is expected only in private study areas.  
Elsewhere the pleasure of discovery and exchange is welcomed \(see  
Figure 26.4\). Restricting silence to special areas allows the remainder  
to become a place for sharing ideas and jointly pursuing knowledge.

**26.4** *Key relationships in the library \(Brian Edwards\)* **26-4 Libraries**  
# 2.2 Integration of book and digital media  
Although books remain vital to the library, the first point of contact  
is usually the catalogue screen or digitised media messaging. The  
interaction between digital knowledge and the printed word is a  
dynamic one requiring space characteristics different from that of  
the traditional library. Many modern libraries place the computer  
screen at the front door allowing the reader to pass through knowl-  
edge layers as they navigate the library. The role of library staff  
is to aid navigation through types and modes of knowledge rather  
than exercise security or sit behind glass screens. Today’s librarians  
are data networkers and media and subject navigators with direct  
contact with readers at the front desk and at various points within  
the library. In directing readers to the diversity of new material,  
there is a great deal of interaction, both verbal and digital, which  
inevitably affects the interior layout and character of the library.  
Another significant shift over the past two decades has been  
the increasing role of libraries in life-long learning, in providing  
community information, and in supporting the needs of the elderly  
particularly in the area of IT provision and training. By 2020,  
nearly half of Europeans will be over 65 years old and here the  
library has particularly important services to provide. This has ram-  
ifications for the design and layout of library buildings, the level of  
lighting and provision of facilities from workstations to toilets and  
disabled access.  
For people who do not possess English as their first language, or  
for individuals who are newly arrived in an area, the library is often  
the first point of community contact. Hence, the qualities and values  
expressed through architectural design leave a lasting impression.  
For these reasons, the library today is seen as a gateway to learning  
and a shop window to new knowledge and community services.  
The latter leads to some public libraries taking on the role of citi-  
zens advice bureaus with librarians quasi social workers.  
# 3 LIBRARY DESIGN  
The design of library buildings should be addressed at three levels\:  
• Urban design  
• Building design  
• Interior design.  
Each has specific requirements which involve dialogue with user  
and interest groups, and each level has its own exacting demands  
which cannot be overlooked \(see Table V\). Library design is more  
than an exercise in architectural form making in spite of the grow-  
ing interest in typological reinvention.  
# Principal site planning considerations Issues to consider  
# Table V Planning  
Civic presence • Relationship to other public buildings  
• Visible presence  
Public access • Access to public transport  
• Disabled access  
Service access • Access to road system  
• Delivery and storage areas  
Urban design • External public gathering space  
• Safe, secure and legible routes  
# 3.1 Urban design  
It is vital that libraries are buildings that the community can be  
proud of and want to use. The design should be open, inviting and  
transparent. There should be a sense of ‘library-ness’ in the design  
of the building as a whole, its main spaces and more intimate study  
rooms. This may be translated differently between a major public  
library and an academic one but the building should still communi-  
cate its essentials as a library\: a place where society’s knowledge is  
stored and made available free of charge.  
The trend away from branch libraries and separate faculty librar-  
ies means the library is assuming ever greater importance as a prime  
civic building as it becomes a centralised facility. The public library  
therefore needs to be well connected to civic life and the academic  
library located at the centre of the college or university. Good access  
to pedestrian flows and public transport is essential, as is the ability  
to service libraries with their ever evolving collections and needs.  
Hence, there will normally be a public front and a service rear  
or undercroft. However, the public entrance is not normally the  
library door but a gathering space immediately outside it.  
Libraries should turn outdoor spaces into assets that support  
meeting, exchanging ideas, reading outdoors or simply sitting in  
attractive surroundings. These should be designed with the char-  
acteristics of a public square with attention to landscape design,  
public comfort \(i.e. seats\) and community or personal safety. The  
library ‘square’ is where users will meet, escape from the con-  
fines of the library to reflect on the material, or take short breaks  
to eat sandwiches or visit local cafes and other cultural facilities.  
Aristotle defined the city as ‘a collection of buildings where men  
live a common life for a noble end’ and nowhere is this more evi-  
dent than in the public library.  
The external library space should be free of cars although pub-  
lic modes of transport can \(and often should\) pass nearby. There  
also needs to be provision for disabled access and facilities for the  
storage of bicycles. Hence, a level access is preferable and ramps  
essential where changes of level are inevitable. The public space  
alongside the library entrance provides an opportunity to make a  
statement of the building and this in turn can help signal the sig-  
nificance of the library. It also provides the chance to incorporate  
sculpture or other forms of public art into the city – some of which  
may contain text references to the library collection.  
With university libraries, the building needs to be centrally placed  
on the campus and located where 24 hour surveillance is possible.  
There is often a linear plaza at the centre of campus where other  
academic institutions are located such as senate house, refectory,  
gymnasium and registry. This provides an opportunity for the forma-  
tion of a student-centred academic mall which ties together the key  
shared facilities with links to the separate faculty buildings further  
afield. Hence, one role of the academic library is to define the centre  
of the campus both spatially and in terms of building hierarchy.  
The flows from the external public space to the main building  
entrance are more clearly defined if attention is paid to urban design  
at the briefing stage. The choice of site often dictates external rela-  
tionships. Proximity to public transport and existing pedestrian or  
cycle flows is imperative. There are parallel flows too which need  
to be considered such as the delivery of books, newspapers, furni-  
ture and access for staff. The service entrance needs to have good  
road access and a limited amount of delivery and parking space.  
Increasingly, information is electronically delivered using wire or  
wireless technology and this eases the demand upon physical ser-  
vice areas. However, delivery and storage of the library material is  
a major consideration at the site planning level.  
# 3.2 The design of the library  
Libraries are used for long periods of time. Therefore if the pub-  
lic library is to serve society and the university library its students  
and teaching staff, then great attention is needed to interior design,  
furnishings and fittings of both study and more public spaces \(see  
Table VI\).  
# Table VI Design  
# Key design characteristics of libraries  
Visible, recognisable and legible as a type  
Adaptable to new information technology and physically extendable  
Comfortable and disabled friendly  
Inviting, safe and secure for users  
Protection and security of the collection **Libraries 26-5**  
It is important that the brief for a new library mentions the  
values the building should entail \(see Table VII\). Briefs are more  
than flow diagrams and floor area charts. A good brief contains  
higher ambition, thereby ensuring the building meets society’s  
aspirations for libraries. There needs to be a clear diagram for the  
library in plan and cross section. Clarity in plan allows the user to  
comprehend the logic of the layout with the main features \(such  
as reading rooms and IT suits\) in obvious locations. Creating a  
clear diagram is a challenge too in section and here the library  
needs to have a coherent strategy for daylight, ventilation and  
acoustics.  
# Table VII Key factors to consider in interior design  
*Technical*  
Are the floor loadings adequate for the collection?  
Is the wiring and wireless layout suitable for future IT needs?  
Are the environmental conditions acceptable for the planned use?  
Is the building energy efficient?  
Is the collection secure from fire or theft?  
*Aesthetic*  
Is the building welcoming as well as functional?  
Are the routes and major spaces legible to the user?  
Is there space for reflection?  
Do readers have good access to daylight and views?  
The external square or set back public space leads the library  
visitor immediately to the entrance doors. These need to be invit-  
ing, wide and transparent, and arranged so that the interior can be  
viewed immediately upon arrival. It should also be possible to see  
the major library spaces from the outside, thereby providing links  
to the life of the city \(see Figure 26.5\). Too frequently in the past  
the demands for security interrupted the physical and visible flows  
between the inside and outside worlds.  
In large libraries, it is often possible to form an outer foyer  
before the user reaches the library proper. Here there may be  
lockers, information boards relating to community activities, a  
café and sandwich bar and meeting rooms. This transition space  
between the inner and outer worlds requires particular attention in  
order to avoid disruption to the library. Once inside the library the  
user should be able to comprehend the key spaces and principal  
routes.  
# 3.3 Library desk  
The library desk and control barrier provides an essential element  
in the working of the library. It is the main point of contact between  
users and library staff and the spoken work is essential to aid nav-  
igation through the collection. The library control desk should not  
form an impervious wall but provide an inviting permeable barrier  
through which visitors pass. The trend towards self-service check  
in and out of books and other material frees up the librarians to  
become ‘floor walkers’ aiding readers in their search for informa-  
tion. The control or self-service point where books are checked in  
and out should remain part of the entrance experience rather than  
the dominant element for the visitor. Increasingly, the next point of  
contact is with the computerised catalogue or the IT support area  
which is usually nearby. To counter the dominance of digital infor-  
mation systems in some libraries \(which can deter the elderly\) there  
is often a magazine or newspaper area nearby.  
# 3.4 Arrangement strategy  
There are two main strategies for arranging the book collection. The  
first is to stack the books near the centre of the library arranging  
reading tables around the edge where there is good access to natural  
light and external views. The second is to place the books around the  
perimeter with a large central reading room often lit from above. The  
latter provides the opportunity to create an interior volume where  
readers can move between paper and electronic media. The integra-  
tion of modes of knowledge and types of media is often difficult in  
practice because of the specific requirements of computers and the  
nature of some paper-based collections such as old newspapers or  
photographs. So in spite of the ideal of integration, there are often  
special study areas dedicated to types of media or study material.  
# 3.5 Flexibility  
Since the storage and use of knowledge is changing rapidly, libraries  
need to retain a high level of flexibility. The ability of the building  
to change over time without compromising the key attributes of  
what constitutes architecturally a ‘library’ is an important consider-  
ation at the design stage. Libraries are recognisable buildings where  
spaces like the reading room help to define the type. To provide flex-  
ibility at the price of character risks removing the important civic  
dimension. However, libraries need to be able to adapt to changing  
information technologies and their evolving cultural or social role  
if they are to achieve their full relevance in the twenty-first century.  
**26.5** *Conceptual diagram of the relationship of library to other civic functions \(Brian Edwards\)* **26-6 Libraries**  
# 3.6 Circulation  
Circulation, which may account for 10–20 per cent of floor areas, is  
used for access and for socialising. Such areas should contain seats  
and niches off the flow to encourage informal exchanges. Major  
staircases should also be designed as processional spaces where  
the scope and fluidity of knowledge is experienced architecturally.  
# 3.7 Zoning  
Zoning the interior of the library into distinctive areas \(Figure 26.6\)  
rather than separate rooms is the policy generally adopted in all  
but national libraries \(Figure 26.7\). Integration is the norm within  
the constraints imposed by noise, PC screen conditions and reader  
comfort.  
These separate zones may be distinctive functional areas but  
they are generally linked by wide connecting spaces. Zoning  
allows one area to adopt a different policy on noise or security than  
another, permits internal change without disruption to the whole  
and allows different users to employ the library resources in dif-  
ferent ways. A varied interior culture is preferable to one where  
there is a corporate standardisation across the whole building. Such  
variety can be engineered or left to grow as the nature of users and  
the collection changes \(see Table VIII\). At Peckham Library, for  
example, there are three pods within the main book areas designed  
specifically to house the special collections. Each is specific to the  
collection and tailored to the tastes of potential users.  
Increasingly, paper and electronic sources are physically inte-  
grated on the reader’s desk but there is usually a zone or room  
for computer users; a separate area for those referring to journals  
or newspapers; a defined floor area for the library book stacks; a  
separate space for reading desks and perhaps special study carrels.  
# 3.8 Access  
Libraries require a great deal of service access for the delivery of  
books and study material, and for the removal of waste. However,  
**26.6** *Relationship between the functional and social zones in the library \(Brian Edwards\)*  
**26.7** *Diagrammatic layout of a national library \(Brian Edwards\)* **Table VIII Typical services provided within a public or academic library**  
• Access to and loan of books  
• Access to journals and newspapers  
• Use of workstations  
• Access to the internet  
• Electronic access to research journals  
• Guidance to sources of information  
• Community learning and visitor support  
• Café and refreshment area  
the prime access consideration relates to users, both able and dis-  
abled. Wheelchair provision is essential in all areas of the library  
except in compact storage zones. Wheelchair users need to be  
able to reverse at the end of bookstacks and to rise unimpeded  
between floors. Security barriers should also be wide enough  
for wheelchair access. Disabled access in libraries is relatively  
straightforward. However, problems can occur around cafes and  
bookshops where wheelchair access for library users may become  
obstructed.  
# 4 ROOM LAYOUT, FURNITURE AND SHELVING  
# 4.1 Book stacks  
Most libraries are sub-divided by book stacks which provide the  
basis for zoning areas into functional parts \(see Table IX\). The stacks  
provide also acoustic protection, have important environmental qual-  
ities \(they provide thermal mass\) and help define routes through the  
library. The position and type of shelving is essential to the smooth  
operation of a library and needs to be located carefully in relation  
to the fixed parts such as columns, lifts, stairs, walls and doors. The  
book stacks also dictate the layout of seating, tables and the position  
of workstations.

stacks  
Normally, book stacks are centrally located with reading  
spaces around the edge of the building or around the perimeter  
of atria spaces \(Figures 26.8, 26.9\). However, main libraries have  
large and distinctive reading rooms. Such spaces may be on upper  
floors or overlooking external spaces and will, in all probability,  
be used by readers surfing book, journal and internet sources.  
Reading rooms are usually different to IT areas but there may be  
physical overlap.  
# 4.2 IT provision and digital media  
Growth in IT provision is sometimes at the cost of areas for book  
storage. As a result, shelving is often closely spaced and increas-  
ingly aspects of the book collection are stored elsewhere. Growing  
use of libraries is sometimes at the expense of space standards,  
both in seating area and library shelving. Designers need to con-  
sider both the needs of readers and of staff who have the task of  
servicing the collection. Although books are generally decreasing  
# Libraries 26-7  
in size, art books are getting larger, and whereas PCs are also  
shrinking with growing use of laptops and tablets, the number  
of readers who arrive armed with the latest digital technology  
is increasing rapidly. Hence, layouts and service points need to  
accommodate these changes.  
Academic libraries provide much more computer space than  
public libraries \(Figure 26.10\). In some university libraries,  
the areas given over to IT-based learning resource centres can  
exceed that of book and journal storage. The use and loan of  
CDs, the development of a learning rather than a teaching culture  
has led also to the academic library being extensively employed  
in group teaching. Rooms are set aside for seminars within the  
library itself, and often the internet provides the main resources  
on which students draw. As a result the nature of the interior  
spaces changes into a hybrid between the traditional library  
reading room and something more akin to a market trading floor  
\(Figures 26.11, 26.12\). The use of the library for seminar type  
teaching also puts pressure on the lifts, stairs and corridors at  
the end of timetabled teaching and this can disrupt private study  
areas.  
Table layout is an important consideration since the dis-  
tribution of reader spaces can influence the configuration of  
columns and interior walls \(see Table X\). The layout of tables  
and shelves is largely dependent upon the type of library in ques-  
tion. Libraries with large book collections increasingly store less  
frequently used material in basement areas or in other locations.  
Here compact rolling book stacks can be employed, thereby sav-  
ing on space and cost. Basement storage is useful because the  
high loadings can be more readily accommodated than on upper  
floors and the reader is not kept waiting too long for the material  
to be accessed. Reader tables, rather than individual study desks,  
are the norm and these are usually placed near the perimeter of  
the library or in special reader rooms. Tables usually have the  
facility to use a laptop and often there is a desk lamp and small  
storage area provided per reader space on a shared table of per-  
haps eight seating positions.  
An area needs to be set aside also for special library use such  
as employing large atlases or maps, broadsheet newspapers and  
archival material. There may be security issues to consider as  
well as furniture needs such as large tables. Often there is the  
need to make copies and this can pose a noise and environmental  
problem. In public libraries, there is often a sharing of tables for  
a variety of purposes but in academic and professional libraries,  
study areas are set aside for specific purposes, Figures 26.13,  
26.14, 26.15.

# 5 SPACE STANDARDS  
# 5.1 Space types  
There are no international standards for space in relation to pub-  
lic libraries, as the range of groups served is deemed to be too  
variable \(IFLA, 2001\). However, schools and academic libraries  
have recommended space allowances related to the numbers of  
students. **26-8 Libraries**

Normally seven types of space need to be provided in a new  
library building\:  
• *Collection space* – to take account of books \(open access and  
closed\), periodicals \(display and back issues\) and non-print  
resources. Digital resources may need some space allocation.  
• *Electronic workstation space* – for staff use, public use in the  
main areas as well as in meeting room areas. A public access  
catalogue used from a seated position requires 4 m2  
.  
• *User seating space* – at tables or alone. Plan for five seats per 1000  
users. Table seating requires 2.5 m2 per reader, a study carrel, and  
lounge chairs 3–4 m2. A useful average is 3 m2 per seated reader.  
• *Staff work space* – including areas in the public part of the  
library and separate work room facilities. Fifteen square metres  
per staff work area \(e.g. issue counter, help desk\) is a good  
planning guide.  
• *Meeting space* – including conference space, a lecture theatre  
or a room for children’s activities. Space would also need to  
be allocated to other functions like cafes with storage space for  
equipment.  
• *Special use space* – for example, a local history room, job centre,  
tourist information centre or special collection with appropriate  
facilities for users to access the material.  
• *Non-assignable space* – including toilets, stairs, lifts, corridors  
and space required for heating or other systems on which the  
library depends. In general, non-assignable space accounts for  
between 20 and 25 per cent of the gross floor area of a typical  
library.

**26.14** *Noise zoning in a typical academic library \(Brian Edwards\)*  
**26.15** *Noise planning in a typical academic library \(Brian Edwards\)*  
Dedicated areas for the use of electronic media are increasingly  
provided in libraries of all types. Although the integration of dig-  
ital and paper-based systems is the ideal, often the constraints of  
security, noise and readership needs lead to the zoning of an area  
for the prime use of CDs and other forms of electronic media. In  
many academic libraries a dedicated learning resources centre is  
provided catering specifically for computer use often with asso-  
ciated mixed-media, printing and teaching spaces. These areas  
require provision not unlike that in many business premises.  
Hence, the design breaks the mould of the traditional library in the  
type of lighting, wiring layout and acoustic provision. As a result,  
there is often a library and IT learning centre side by side either  
as two joined buildings under the same envelope \(Thames Valley  
University, Figure 26.10\) or two separate but adjacent buildings  
\(University of Sunderland\). In public libraries where the level of  
IT provision is lower, the two activities are normally integrated.  
# 5.2 Usage data  
Current library data should be taken into account in the specifica-  
tion for a new library relating to\:  
• Opening hours \(all or part of the library including out-of-hours\)  
• Peak usage times  
• Usage broken down by hours  
• Days of the week library open  
• Times of the year \(particularly for university/college libraries\)  
• Number of users \(preferably separate figures for each part of the library\)  
• Associated activities, for example, meeting rooms, exhibition area\(s\)  
• Facilities, for example, toilets, vending area, café  
• Staff services to users – how many staff will be on duty/service  
points, security points  
• Staff facilities, for example, workroom, offices, post room, ser-  
vices, storage.  
# 5.3 Public libraries  
There are no absolute standards on the amount of public library  
space per capita. The 2001 International Federation of Library  
Associations guidelines state \(p. 43\) that\:  
The amount of floor space required by a public library depends  
on such factors as the unique needs of the individual commu-  
nity, the functions of the library, the level of resources available,  
the size of the collection, the space available and the proximity  
of other libraries.  
And they go on to say that because these elements vary so  
much, ‘it is not possible to propose a universal standard on the  
space required for a public library’. **26-12 Libraries**  
Although dated, the publication ‘The Public Library Service\:  
IFLA/UNESCO Guidelines for Development’ includes \(in  
Appendix 4\) a set of guidelines produced for Ontario Public librar-  
ies in 1997, which states that, for a community under 100 000, the  
appropriate amount of floor space for public libraries is 56 m2 per  
1000 capita. This set of guidelines goes on to prescribe\:  
• Collection space\: 110 volumes/m2  
.  
• User space\: five user spaces per 1000 capita, user space = 2.8 m2  
.  
• Staff space\: 16.3 m2 per member of staff \(assuming one member  
of staff per 2000 population\).  
• Multi-purpose rooms\: depends on community service and pro-  
gramme objectives.  
• Non-assignable space \(staircases, toilets, etc.\)\: 20 per cent of net  
space \(= space taken by first four categories\).  
In 2001, the DCMS consulted on a net figure of 23 m2 of new  
library space per 1000 population as a potential public library  
standard. Analysis shows that figures currently in use for plan-  
ning purposes are around 30 m2 per 1000 population range. There  
has been a tendency for the figure to rise through time, not least  
because libraries are acquiring more functions, often at the behest  
of central government.  
# 5.4 Academic and college libraries  
CILIP’s Guidelines for colleges recommend the following\:  
• 1 library study seat per 10 full-time students in further education  
• 1 library study seat per six full-time students in higher education  
• 2.5 m2 per student workspace in resource-based learning-rooms  
or learning resource centres  
• between 2.5 m2 and 4 m2 per student workspace in higher education  
• reader modules minimum 900 mm × 600 mm  
• ICT/ILT spaces minimum 1200 mm × 800 mm  
• circulation space \(gangways\) of 1200 mm minimum \(1800 mm  
preferred\); access to desk or workstation requires 1000 mm  
minimum; private space for user 600 mm outward from desk.  
However, disabled space needs may exceed these figures.  
# 6 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS  
# 6.1 Natural light and ventilation  
Libraries are big consumers of environmental resources. The bulk  
of energy consumed is normally in artificial lighting. Hence, the  
design strategy should seek to maximise daylight and to use the  
incidental gains from electric lighting for supplementary heating.  
This assumes integration between lighting, heating and ventilation  
with mixed-mode technologies, heat recovery and judicious use of  
renewable energy \(see Table XI\).  
# Table XI Environmental considerations  
Restrict plan depth to 15 metres for maximum daylight penetration  
Create internal atria in large depth libraries  
Provide solar shading and internal blinds on large south and west facing glazing areas  
Use external light shelves to increase daylight penetration  
Place reader tables in well-lit areas  
Avoid air-conditioning except in ‘hot spots’  
Employ mixed-mode ventilation systems  
Maximise natural ventilation in public areas  
One trend is towards the use of atria to create internal lighting  
conditions which reduce the demand for artificial sources. Noise  
transmission and fire risk will, however, need to be considered in  
atria-based layouts.  
Natural light and ventilation are preferable, especially in the  
reader areas, but security and plan depth can make this difficult  
to achieve. As a result, most libraries employ a mixed-mode  
ventilation system which incorporates a hybrid of natural and  
mechanical systems, often employing atria spaces and sometimes  
double façades. Since libraries use a great deal of artificial lighting,  
solar heat gain can be a problem especially where large areas of  
glazing are provided on south facing elevations, leading to glare,  
discomfort and excess temperatures. It is better to avoid a southern  
orientation; ideally reading rooms should face north to avoid these  
problems. But where unavoidable, solar screening using internal  
and external blinds, or fixed solar shading or special glass may  
be required \(Figure 26.16\). However, the use of solid facades to  
**26.16** *Diagrammatic section of a modern university library \(Brian Edwards\)* **Libraries 26-13**  
exclude adverse external conditions is not advisable if the library too with acoustic zoning. Often exposed concrete construction is  
is to assume a level of social engagement. It is facade transparency used to reduce temperature fluctuations using the thermal capacity  
which often identifies the library as a key building in the city or on of construction sometimes linked to chilled beams. Here it is worth-  
campus \(Figures 26.17, 26.18\). while considering both the mass of the library collection and that of  
In many ways, the book collection itself stabilises internal tem- its structure together. However, users, their equipment and lighting  
peratures using thermal mass. The position of bookstacks also helps can stress temperature expectations leading to reader fatigue.

**26.18** *Template for design of national library \(Brian Edwards\)* **26-14 Libraries**  
**26.19** *Brighton Public Library is designed with both study and environmental concerns in mind \(Bennetts Associates\)*  
# 6.2 Artificial lighting  
As a matter of course, low energy light fittings and sensors should  
be fitted in all areas. The use of task lighting can result in lowering  
general light levels but with a growing elderly population, reducing  
overall light levels can result in accidents and poor user satisfac-  
tion. Light reflection on computer screens is also a consideration  
and generally results in PCs being in more central areas.  
In order to maximise natural light and ventilation, the plan depth  
should not exceed 15 metres. However, this is difficult to achieve  
in all but the smallest of libraries, and hence artificial conditions  
are provided in most areas. Since most libraries are constructed in  
urban centres, the main environmental factors are normally glare,  
solar gain, external air quality and noise pollution \(Figure 26.19\).  
Hence a great deal of attention should be directed to site choice and  
layout, the design of external facades and the internal zoning of the  
building using light wells and mini atria \(as at the new Birmingham  
City Library\).  
As a general rule readers like to work in natural light. This  
normally results in the perimeter placing of reader tables. Some  
seating areas can also be provided in inner sunlit spaces, particu-  
larly where magazines and newspapers are read. The creation  
of relaxation areas as distinct from study areas should take into  
account the different environmental conditions which may exist.  
Readers like views and hence study spaces or carrels generally  
occupy the library perimeter with major reading rooms placed on  
upper floors. Views of the city and of nature are usually preferred.  
based on a projected 5000 visitors a day. However, the day after  
opening, the number jumped to 9000. Moving the existing collec-  
tion also requires many additional staff hours, as does the setting up  
and configuring of the large amount of state-of-the-art equipment.  
# 7.3 Efficient staffing  
Library staff numbers are generally reducing, while new electronic  
resources take an ever larger proportion of the budget. It is impor-  
tant to design a library that can be staffed safely and efficiently by  
the smallest possible number of people. For example, book stacks  
and work areas need to be arranged so that staff can use their time  
efficiently and flexibly. Generally, equipment needs to be central-  
ised so that the building can be adequately operated and staff desks  
located so that one librarian can provide surveillance over a large  
physical area. A well-designed library of today is usually able to  
achieve lower staffing levels than a poorly designed library from  
the 1970s or 1980s allowing staff to be the readers’ subject nav-  
igators.  
# 7 FINANCING AND RESOURCING  
# 7.1 Hard times and the centralising of facilities  
The enthusiasm that accompanies the planning of a new library  
can induce an artificial atmosphere of plenty, even amid harsh  
financial constraints, and architects need to remember that librar-  
ies, especially branch ones, can experience difficult times. While  
many cities such as Birmingham and the larger London boroughs  
are building large new facilities to catch the public eye and often  
employing architects of note, branch libraries are being starved of  
funding and community groups are increasingly helping to staff  
and maintain them under the present UK government’s localism  
initiative. There may be staffing cuts, cuts in book fund or the need  
to cancel journal subscriptions.  
# 7.2 Operating budgets  
The problem in many new library projects is that the construction  
budget is not always reflected in the library’s operating budget.  
When the new library opens its doors, the public will flock in to  
enjoy its many attractions, but if there is an inadequate budget to  
support new or expanded services, this can lead to difficulties. In  
a recent example, a new central library was planned with staffing  
# 8 CASE STUDY – BIRMINGHAM LIBRARY  
# 8.1 Introduction  
Redevelopment of Birmingham’s central library, the largest public  
library in Britain, stemmed from a desire to build a new urban land-  
mark as part of wider transformations of the city centre. The new  
library, designed by Dutch practice Mecanoo, replaces a modern-  
ist library built in 1974 to designs by the John Madin Partnership  
and addresses both urban design and library design in a fresh way  
which is as much about people as it is about books. It is one of  
a generation of super libraries found increasingly in the world’s  
major cities where the book remains a prominent part of the library  
experience.  
# 8.2 Urban design  
The new Birmingham library stands in Centenary Square sand-  
wiched between two distinguished neighbours – the Birmingham  
Repertory Theatre and the Art Deco Baskerville House. Mecanoo  
restructured the square and sought to revitalise it as a largely  
pedestrian experience, providing a place to meet before entering  
the library and somewhere to read or think within the hectic city.  
It also provides internal links to the theatre and an underground  
gateway to the library.  
# 8.3 Entrance  
The 35,000 sqm library is approached beneath a large canopy  
which projects into the square \(Figures 26.20, 26.21\). Above  
this stands the double height reading room with external balcony  
which provides users with views into the square and beyond to  
the city. **Libraries 26-15**

*& heritage open research, 12\) Staff offices, 13\) Shakespeare Memorial Room*  
# 8.4 Layout  
The 10-storey library houses a children’s library and book store in  
the basement. On the ground floor \(Figure 26.22\), a lofty entrance  
foyer with café and exhibition area leads via escalators to eight  
floors of reading rooms, multi-media areas, IT study and archive  
spaces. On the roof within a gold coloured rotunda stands the  
reconstructed Shakespeare Memorial Room rescued from the orig-  
inal Birmingham public library built in 1874. It contains one of the  
largest Shakespeare collections in the UK.  
Although books are found on all levels, three floors of the  
library contain book stacks housed in dense mobile storage sys-  
tems or double height stack rooms. This compaction allows space  
to be provided for readers in well-lit areas around the library  
perimeter or close to atria. Here, IT and traditional reading tables  
are integrated although there are also separate multi-media and  
quiet study rooms. The main book collection is housed on open  
shelves which radiate out from the main atria giving readers views  
to the outside world.  
Different spaces are designed according to the nature of the  
collection or the demands of the media employed \(Figure 26.23\).  
Rooms and study areas are therefore distinctive rather than stand-  
ardised with archive, music and heritage collections having their  
own special spaces fashioned by conservation demands or the char-  
acter of the collection \(Figure 26.24\). **26-16 Libraries**

# 8.5 Circulation  
Circulation is mainly via escalators and atria recalling the ambience  
of a department store. The circular atria are lined with books or  
murals and their distinctive character helps users navigate through  
this large library.  
The atria also provide natural light and solar assisted ventilation  
within the deep planned areas. Light from above filtering into atria  
creates uplift physically \(for air movement\) and psychologically  
\(for the spirit\). Fatigue is further relieved by generous provision of  
escalators and lifts which are placed to entice you into the build-  
ing. Routes are designed to make connections between digital and  
paper-based media, and between open and enclosed spaces.  
# 8.6 Facade design  
The facades are unified by the application of an external metal  
grille of matt and silver circular bands. Where the inner facade is  
fully glazed, these act as solar shades and daylight filters to reduce  
heat gain and glare inside. Where the walls are solid, they provide a  
filigree pattern of shadows giving interest and depth to the facades.  
As a unifying motif, this controversial circular decoration alludes  
to the industrial heritage of the city of Birmingham.  
# 8.7 Energy  
As with all libraries, the main users of energy are lighting and  
cooling. Birmingham library is rated BREEAM Excellent and  
incorporates ground-sourced water from deep aquifers, which  
provides chilling of the building structure as well as grey water  
systems. On the basement floor where the children’s library is  
located, the mass of the soil provides acoustic buffering and ther-  
mal stabilisation.  
The building has a mixed mode and natural ventilation strategy  
with the facade allowing fresh air intake and outflow.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
Industrial storage buildings, logistics buildings, warehouses or per-  
haps the more derogatory term of ‘sheds’ play a significant part in  
the UK economy. By 2020, logistics contributed in excess of 7 per  
cent of UK annual gross domestic product \(GDP\).  
Whatever their name, logistics buildings are essentially build-  
ings for the collection, storage and dispatch of merchandise. As  
the diversity and range of products is so vast, there are numerous  
means of physically providing storage as well as managing the flow  
of products from source to consumer.  
The evolution of e-commerce and online shopping has played  
a significant part in the expansion of the sector, as customers have  
become increasingly comfortable buying products online as opposed  
to visiting retail on the high street. Organisational models in the sec-  
tor have evolved to respond to online retail as operator and supplier  
networks seek to supply products to customers faster than ever. This  
has resulted in the emergence of more localised logistics buildings  
closer to residential centres. Known as urban logistics centres, these  
fulfil ‘last mile’ deliveries or the final leg of the delivery of a product.  
This chapter will describe the general organisation types of logis-  
tics buildings and networks, explaining their key constituent parts and  
the facilities that are required to enable logistics facilities to function.  
These include external space for access for service vehicles delivering  
or dispatching products, as well as internal racking storage systems.  
# 2.2 Consolidation centres  
Consolidation centres are regarded as buildings where products  
from a range of suppliers are received and consolidated before  
they are delivered as a consignment to more localised facilities,  
such as urban logistics facilities or retail outlets. The use of  
consolidation centres provides an opportunity to optimise con-  
signments into one delivery vehicle, thus reducing the number of  
vehicles on the road and reducing CO2 emissions. Further opti-  
misation is potentially available via collaboration with suppliers  
and third party logistics operators to optimise vehicle loads and  
reduce road miles.  
# 2 ORGANISATIONAL MODELS AND TYPES  
# 2.1 National and regional distribution centres  
National and regional distribution facilities \(NDC/RDCs\) are cen-  
tralised facilities where goods are received, sorted and distributed  
to more localised facilities or consolidation centres. As a central-  
ised facility, the size of the building tends to be the largest of an  
operator’s portfolio. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘hub and  
spoke’ operation model to illustrate the expansion of an opera-  
tor’s logistics network from one central hub branching to regional

**27-1** **27-2 Logistics buildings**  
# 2.3 Urban logistics/last mile logistics centres  
Urban logistics/last mile facilities are a product of e-commerce  
and online retail \(*Keep London Working,* SEGRO\). They are  
located adjacent to residential areas to fulfil deliveries quickly,  
even within the same day of ordering. The flow of products  
through the building is rapid so there is no significant demand  
for temporary storage. Consequently, urban logistics facilities  
are of a smaller scale and so are more compatible adjacent to  
residential areas.  
# 2.4 Click and collect  
Click and collect facilities are increasingly common in urban  
areas. With these, products bought online are delivered to small  
facilities located in urban areas so that customers can collect their  
consignment at their leisure or on their way to work or home. This  
provides greater convenience for customers who wish to collect  
their merchandise. A key benefit also is that operators can deliver  
many consignments to a single address, therefore saving time and  
reducing road time and emissions of delivery vehicles. In addition,  
deliveries can be made to click and collect outlets outside of con-  
ventional business hours, thereby reducing the impact on traffic  
congestion.  
# 2.5 Reverse/returns logistics  
A by-product of online shopping is the process of returning  
rejected goods back to the seller. This is known as reverse logis-  
tics. Arguably, an advantage of high-street retail is that you can  
try before you buy. But with online retail this is more difficult and  
consequently more items are returned. Approximately 30 per cent  
of online purchases are returned, which creates a logistics operation  
in addition to the fulfilment of purchases.  
# 3 THE INDUSTRY STANDARD WAREHOUSE  
# 3.1 Typical features and parameters  
Most UK logistics facilities are designed and derived from  
a typical set of parameters. These features are recognised as  
industry standards by most agents, developers and funds alike.  
Incorporating industry standards provides an opportunity for  
buildings to be reused by other occupiers without potentially  
having to demolish the building and start again. This ultimately  
becomes a cost effective and more sustainable solution. Some  
operators however have very specific product ranges that may  
require a bespoke storage solution. In these circumstances, the  
funding mechanism becomes a little more limited as a bespoke  
building will not necessarily appeal to other operators if the build-  
ing becomes vacant at a later date.  
The function of a logistics building is essentially to provide a  
watertight, thermally-efficient container or wrapper around mer-  
chandise and the storage system that houses it.  
The structure of the building is usually a steel portal frame that  
is lightweight and optimised to provide large, clear spans of up  
to 35 m and spaced at 8 m centres, with ‘hit and miss’ internal  
columns at 16 m centres. This minimises the number of internal  
columns and potential clashes with storage system structures. The  
building structure is modularised so that standardised components  
can slot into the structural frame and be prefabricated off site, thus  
speeding up construction time.  
In addition, the facility is required to be securely accessed by  
goods vehicles that can deliver and dispatch products efficiently  
and, depending upon the storage solution, will need space to  
facilitate the sorting of products so they arrive at their intended  
destination.  
Service areas and service access doors are provided to ena-  
ble products to be transferred from vehicle to facility and vice  
versa. There are established industry standards for the width  
of service areas that allow goods vehicles to be parked against  
the building, space for manoeuvring goods vehicles to access  
service doors and also space for vehicles to be stored within a  
secure area. **Logistics buildings 27-3**

Table I provides an overview of the expected parameters associ-  
ated with a typical industrial and logistics building.  
# 3.2 Typical examples  
Unit sizes may vary from 2,000 m2 to in excess of 40,000 m2  
.  
A typical small industrial/logistics unit of 2,000 m2 will have  
a 30 m service yard and level access doors, Figure 27.1. Car park-  
ing is shown separated, although units of this size may sometimes  
consolidate service and parking areas. Small/medium sized units of  
around 5,000 sq m will have a minimum service yard of 35 m and  
both dock access doors and level access doors, Figure 27.2. Car  
parking is separated.  
A typical example of an industrial/logistics unit with a total  
area of circa 30000 m2 comprises a building proportion generally  
at a 2\:1 length to width, with a single service area or yard running  
the longer length of the warehouse with dock access doors and  
level access doors distributed along the length of the building,  
Figure 27.3. The service yard depth is 50 m and accommodates  
vehicles engaged at service doors, space for manoeuvring and  
provision for trailer parking. There is a marshalling area within  
the warehouse immediately behind the access doors where mer-  
chandise is organised, having been transported from a vehicle or  
being prepared to be loaded onto a vehicle. Behind the marshal-  
ling area is the storage racking where the merchandise is stored  
ready for picking.  
Access to the service area is controlled via a security gate-  
house that controls access to and egress from the service area  
using barriers. Within the service area, a hub office typically  
provides administrative facilities for drivers to declare the  
products being delivered or transported, as well as driver rest  
facilities.  
A separate car park is provided for staff and visitors to the facility  
and the main administrative office is typically accessed from the main  
car park area. Parking for cars, motorcycles and cycles is provided.  
A proportion of car spaces is usually fitted with electric car charging  
points. Facilities of this size will usually have separate access points  
for goods vehicles and staff/visitor vehicles for safety reasons.  
Where unit sizes exceed 40000 m2, it is common to provide a  
service yard on both sides of the warehouse, Figure 27.4. Known  
as a cross-dock facility, one of the key features is the flow of  
merchandise through the building. Typically, there is a goods  
receiving service yard on one side of the warehouse and a goods  
dispatch yard on the opposite side of the building. The flow of  
merchandise efficiently flows from one side to the other and given  
an increased number of service doors can handle a greater flow  
of product. Service vehicles have full 360° circulation around  
the warehouse so that vehicles can move safely in one direction  
around the building. **27-4 Logistics buildings**

# 3.3 Constituent parts and outline specification  
*Service areas*  
The depth of a service area is generally dependant on the size of the  
proposed logistics unit, as set out in Table II.  
# Table II Depth of service area  
**Unit area \(M2\) Service yard depth \(M\)**  
**Units below 1,000 M2 25**  
**Units below 2,000 M2** 30  
**Units below 4,500 M2** 35  
**Units below 7,000 M2** 40  
**Units above 7,000 M2** 50  
**Units above 20,000 M2** 50\<  
*Building heights*  
The height of industrial and logistics buildings is described as  
haunch height. This is measured to the underside of the steel fillet  
\(known as the haunch\) that reinforces the junction between the roof  
rafter and portal column, Figure 27.5.  
Typical heights are set out in Table III.  
to and from the warehouse. A range of door types is typically used to  
deal with the variety of products being delivered or dispatched.  
Dock access doors enable the loading and unloading of vehicles  
from the rear \(Figure 27.7\). The service yard in front of a dock access  
door is typically 1.2 m below the finished floor level of the ware-  
house. In this way, the floor of the trailer is generally in line with the  
floor of the building so that crates and trolleys can be wheeled easily  
to and from the trailer. In order to mitigate any difference in level  
between the trailer and building floor level, dock levellers are situ-  
ated behind the door and are provided with a lifting mechanism and  
telescopic lip to extend into and connect with the bed of the trailer.  
Level access doors have a level approach between service yard  
and finished floor level so that service trucks \(forklift trucks\) can  
access the side of the trailer and transfer products to and from the  
building. These vehicles are often referred to as ‘curtain siders’  
as they are usually fitted with fabric side panels that slide back to  
allow access. Service vehicles typically park to one side of a level  
access door so that a forklift truck can exit from the building to  
access the side of the service vehicle \(Figure 27.8\).  
Service yards and logistics buildings need to accommodate a  
variety of vehicle sizes, as set out in Figure 27.9.  
# 5 PALLETS AND RACKING SYSTEMS  
# 5.1 Pallets  
There are generally two types of pallet used in the UK, Figure 27.10\:  
• *Standard UK pallet*. This is 1200 × 1000 mm and is available  
in several pallet types and weight-bearing capacities. The most  
popular is the 9-block, with a full-perimeter base. That design  
does not have a dedicated British Standard to formalise it but  
is simply listed as one of five permitted modular sizes in ISO  
6780\:2003 and BS EN 13382\:2002.  
• *Standard European pallet EUR-pallet \(also called EPAL-pallet*  
*or Euro-pallet\)*. This slightly smaller pallet is 1200 × 800 ×  
144 mm \(47.2 in × 31.5 in × 5.7 in\). It is a four-way pallet,  
accessed from all four sides, made of wood that is nailed with 78  
special nails in a prescribed pattern.  
Pallets tend to have multiples of the same product on any one pal-  
let. Other forms of storage device include cages and trolleys that  
tend to be formed with collections of different consignments that  
may be heading to a specific location.  
**27.5** *Location of the building haunch*

**Units above 20,000 M2** 15  
**Units above 30,000 M2** 15\< \(subject to occupier demand\)  
# 4 SERVICE AND HANDLING VEHICLES  
A typical service yard dock is shown in Figure 27.6.  
The primary function of the service elevation of the building is to  
cater for the range of service vehicles that need to transfer products  
# 5.2 Racking systems  
To optimise the product storage capacity of warehouse buildings,  
racking systems and mezzanines are employed to maximise storage  
efficiency. The heights of logistics buildings have generally been  
informed by racking heights so that the higher the building, the  
higher the potential storage capacity. However, as the racking gets  
higher the equipment needed to access the upper racks becomes  
increasingly complex and bespoke. As a result, occupiers are  
increasingly looking to automation and robotics to maximise the  
storage capacity and flow of products through building.  
Typical racking is essentially lightweight steel frame structures  
organised to efficiently store products typically stored on pallets.  
Numerous racking systems have evolved to accommodate specific  
products. The main configurations are listed next\:  
*Standard selective pallet racking*  
This is the most common pallet racking system in use today,  
Figure 27.11. Selective pallet racking typically comes in one of  
two configurations\: a roll-formed and a structural bolt-together  
configuration. The roll-formed selective rack is most commonly  
manufactured in a ‘teardrop’ style \(so named as the holes on the  
column of the upright are shaped like a teardrop\). Pallets rest on  
the horizontal beams. Because the beam configurations can be  
quickly moved, the shelves can be easily adjusted to different **Logistics buildings 27-7**  
**27.6** *Service yard docks*  
**27.7** *Dock access door loading* **27.8** *Level access door loading*  
**27.9** *Service yard configuration and typical service goods vehicles* **Logistics buildings 27-9**  
**27.10** *UK Standard pallet \(left\), Euro pallet \(middle\), cages/trolleys \(right\)*  
heights to accommodate various load sizes. Structural pallet rack  
systems are very similar to roll-formed pallet rack systems except  
the horizontal load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts  
and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. Selective pallet  
rack systems provide easy accessibility to all products at all times.  
**27.11** *Standard selective pallet racking*  
**27.12** *Double deep/deep reach racking*  
*Double deep/deep reach racking*  
Double deep racking with pallets stored two deep from the aisle  
is an ideal way to increase pallet density while maintaining a high  
number of pick faces in the warehouse, Figure 27.12. This type of  
racking system can be manufactured using either roll-formed rack-  
ing or structural racking components.  
*Drive-in/Drive-thru racking*  
Drive-in racking requires operators to drive into the racking  
system from one side and remove pallets from the same entry  
point. Drive-thru racking allows operators to drive into the rack-  
ing system from one side and remove pallets from the opposite  
side. The benefit of Drive-in/Drive-thru racking is that pallets  
are stored back-to-back without aisles for exceptionally dense  
storage, Figure 27.13. **27-10 Logistics buildings**  
**27.13** *Drive-in/Drive-thru racking*  
*Push back racking*  
Push back rack systems are available in structural or roll-formed  
frames. They work by placing pallet loads on a series of nesting  
carts fed forward by gravity on structural steel rails. As a pallet  
is loaded from the front, it pushes the pallet behind it back one  
position. The front pallet is removed when unloading and the rear  
pallets automatically come forward to the front picking position,  
Figure 27.14.  
**27.14** *Push back racking*  
*Pallet flow racking*  
Pallet flow rack systems are driven by gravity, Figure 27.15. Unlike  
in static systems such as Drive-in racking, product flows back to a  
picking position and is easily accessible to the operator. It is perfect  
for fast-moving product with first-in/first out \(FIFO\) stock rotation.  
Heavy-duty skate wheels on sloped shelves allow palletised loads  
to flow forward for picking. The high-density storage utilises space  
with fewer aisles.  
**27.15** *Pallet flow racking*  
# 5.3 Disposition of racking  
Racking is typically orientated at 90° from the marshalling/  
assembly areas to allow products to be easily accessed and flow  
through the building particularly if cross-docked. Please refer to  
Figures 27.1, 27.2.  
The height of racking together with the potential to install  
mezzanines has informed warehouse building heights. Optimum  
heights have been established where both racking and mezzanine  
installations can be optimised, Figures 27.16, 27.17.  
# 6 SECURITY  
Security is generally governed in three areas. Firstly, access and  
control to service areas. This is managed via a security gatehouse  
that is positioned between the main access road and service yard,  
Figure 27.18. The security gatehouse is usually staffed so that  
documents from arriving vehicles can be checked before they are  
allowed entry to the service yard. A key consideration is the pro-  
vision of vehicle stacking so that arriving vehicles do not back up  
onto the main access road and cause congestion. The floor of the  
gatehouse building is elevated so that the sliding hatch/window is  
at a similar height to driver’s windows in goods vehicles.  
Secondly, fencing to service areas. This is typically a 2.4 m  
high paladin or palisade fence that runs the perimeter of the service  
areas. Thirdly, CCTV systems are typically used to monitor site  
boundaries and potential vulnerable areas around the site.  
# 7 FIRE PRECAUTIONS  
In accordance with Approved Document B2 Fire Safety – Volume  
2 Buildings other than dwelling houses \(2019\), Part B5, the access  
around the perimeter of a warehouse building is governed by the size  
of the warehouse. Buildings below 8000 m2 are required to have 15  
per cent of the perimeter of the building available \(unless the height  
of the top floor is above 11 m – then 50 per cent of the perimeter is  
required to be accessible\). Buildings between 8000 m2 and 16000 m2  
require 50 per cent of the perimeter to be accessible regardless of  
eight. Buildings between 16000 m2 and 24000 m2 need 75 per cent  
of the perimeter available and buildings above 24000 m2 require fully  
100 per cent of the perimeter to be accessible. Where the type of fire **Logistics buildings 27-11**

**27.17** *Cross section showing racking height and mezzanines relative to haunch height* **27-14 Logistics buildings**  
**27.18** *A typical gatehouse configuration* appliance is not known in the locality of the site, the fire tender access  
with should be 10 m wide to the requisite percentage.  
Most buildings above 5000 m2 tend to be fitted with sprinklers  
to satisfy and reduce insurance premiums and mitigate potential  
loss. Also, sprinklers may be required if hazardous products are  
stored in the building.  
Two insurance-led associations provide specification requirements  
and rules in the design of sprinkler systems. Firstly, The Loss preven-  
tion Council \(LPC\) rules which are authored by the Fire Protection  
Association \(FPA\) and covered in BS EN 12845\:2015. Secondly,  
Factory Mutual \(FM\) Global, an American mutual insurance com-  
pany. Both provide minimum requirements and rules to enable  
operators to satisfy/reduce insurance liability and loss prevention.  
# 8 FUTURE TRENDS AND INNOVATION  
E-commerce and online shopping continues to grow and surge,  
spurred on by the Covid-19 pandemic. To fulfil deliveries as  
quickly as possible – potentially within hours rather than days  
– operators are looking to locate logistics facilities closer to res-  
idential areas. The availability of land, particularly in the UK, is  
increasingly scarce with local plan developments more focused on  
residential growth to deal with population expansion rather than  
logistics allocation.  
The demand for logistics land has led to increased competition  
for sites resulting in land values increasing. Consequently, oper-  
ators and developers are having to consider alternative logistics  
# Logistics buildings 27-15  
models that place logistics buildings in residential areas, or models  
where increased floor space is required to offset the land cost. New  
models that are emerging include\:  
• Multi-storey logistics with internal mezzanines to increase floor  
space  
• Multi-storey, multi-occupier logistics  
• Multi-storey, multi-use facilities that combine logistics spaces  
with retail, residential and other uses.  
As competition for logistics space continues to increase, there is  
an increasing emphasis on employee well-being, with developers  
and operators engaging with social and physical amenity for the  
employees to both attract and retain staff. Architecturally, this  
allows architects to push the boundaries to deliver this aspiration  
by driving good design while maintaining functional need.  
Looking ahead, there is the exciting prospect of the further  
progression and development of robotics and automation, perhaps  
with deliveries by autonomous vehicles or drones.

9 Bibliography  
The design of museums, art galleries and the temporary exhi-  
bition spaces associated with similar organisations involves the  
housing of a wide range of functions broadly indicated in the  
common definitions of a museum. Museums, however, vary consid-  
erably in size, organisation and purpose. It is important, therefore,  
to consider the particular context and features that characterise a  
museum in the process of developing concepts.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Scope  
Museums are defined by the Museums Association in the UK as  
institutions that collect, safeguard and make accessible artefacts  
and specimens, which they hold in trust for society. They enable  
people to explore these collections for inspiration, learning and  
enjoyment.  
# 1.2 Collections  
Collections in national museums are very large and varied in mate-  
rial and generally of international importance. The National Maritime  
Museum in Greenwich, for example, houses collections of machinery,  
boats, costumes, medals, ship models, paintings, silver, weapons and  
scientific instruments, among many other types of material. Such muse-  
ums are staffed by a wide range of highly qualified experts in collection  
management, research, conservation, public relations and marketing.  
In some local and private museums, collections are small, spe-  
cific in material content and of specialist or local interest. Many  
such museums have only one qualified curator to oversee man-  
agement of the collections and public services, and many of the  
specialist functions may be provided by outside bodies such as the  
Area Museum Councils. Figure 28.1 shows a typology of museums  
based on subject/museological approach, collection characterisa-  
tion and type of institution.

# 2 AREA DATA  
# 2.1 Design guidelines  
There is no convenient formula for determining the areas to be  
devoted to the different functions. The client’s intentions in respect  
of public access to collections, information and staff and of com-  
mitment to research and conservation, will provide an initial guide  
and most major museums, for example, the Victoria and Albert  
Museum will have their own design guidelines.  
# 2.2 Storage  
Some museums may have only a small proportion of the permanent  
collections on public exhibition at any one time, the bulk remaining  
in storage and accessible for research and conservation purposes  
only. Well-serviced temporary exhibition space may be a priority  
in such cases. Other museums may have smaller collections attrac-  
tive enough to the visiting public to warrant the development of  
sophisticated exhibitions with a designed life of several years. In  
such cases storage space may be needed primarily for the expan-  
sion of the collections and considerable effort may be made to  
develop educational programmes.  
**28.4** *A possible layout diagram for a small museum*  
# 3 GENERAL PLANNING  
# 3.1 Organisation  
The relationships between functions are common to all museums  
and art galleries. The flow diagram in Figure 28.2 shows collection  
item movements in the operation of collection services, but note  
**28.5** *Two basic massing concepts that allow public areas to be*  
*organised on one level*  
**28.2** *Flow diagram of collection item movements in the operation*  
*of collection services\: exhibitions, conservation and collections*  
*management*  
that not every operation necessarily requires a separate space, and  
some services may be provided by outside agencies. As far as pos-  
sible, collection movement and public circulation should be kept  
separate. Figure 28.3 shows one approach to zoning and expansion  
based on this principle. Figure 28.4 shows a possible layout for a  
small museum in which interpretive exhibitions and educational  
**28.3** *A layout concept showing a clear relationship between museum functions and an approach to zoning and expansion* programmes are central to its operation. Where a museum is to  
be developed around a large-scale permanent installation this  
should be integrated into the interpretive scheme at an early stage.  
Examples are Jorvik Viking Centre’s archaeological site and the  
National Railway Museum’s turntables.  
# 3.2 Flexibility  
Museums are long-term developments\: concepts for layout and  
massing should therefore be capable of expansion in all areas and a  
degree of internal rearrangement, particularly in work and ancillary  
areas. Figure 28.5 shows possible massing concepts and Figure 28.6  
illustrates the three methods of expansion. The aim of orientation is  
not only easy understanding of the building layout but more crucially  
to facilitate access to collections, information and museum services.  
**28.6** *Three modes of expansion\: a\) Block addition;*  
*b\) Extension; c\) New building*  
# 4 EXHIBITION AND COLLECTION STORAGE  
# SPACES  
# 4.1 Layout  
The layout of public areas in a museum, Figure 28.7, may be based  
on a simple concept of free circulation around a single open-plan  
exhibition space, Figure 28.7a, or on more complex concepts  
related to generic interpretive structures. It is important to consider  
the nature of the narratives appropriate to the museum’s objects of  
interest. The storyline of an exhibition may be translated into\:  
• a *linear* arrangement of spaces with beginning, middle and end,  
Figure 28.7c.  
• a *loop* where the essentially linear storyline leads naturally back  
to the beginning, Figure 28.7d.  
• an arrangement of *core and satellites* where each theme or  
detailed treatment of a subject leads back to a central introduc-  
tory or orientational area, Figure 28.7b.  
• a more *complex* scheme combining linear, loop and core-sat-  
ellite arrangement of spaces which is specifically structured to  
account for more or less stable relationships between collections  
and interpretive themes, Figure 28.7e.  
• a *labyrinthine* arrangement where the relationships between  
areas can be varied from exhibition to exhibition by managing  
the public circulation, Figure 28.7f.  
# 4.2 Orientation  
In any arrangement of exhibition spaces considers the problem of  
orientation; at the entrance to the museum and at key decision points  
in the museum, information and visible clues should be provided to  
enable the visitor to grasp the organisation of the collections, the  
interpretive scheme and the public services offered by the museum.  
# 4.3 Storage  
Many museums carefully control access to all collection storage  
spaces. However, it is increasingly worth considering the provision  
of open-access storage areas particularly for collection study. The  
former requires that storage areas are made secure and that visitors  
are closely supervised. Open access, on the other hand, requires that  
secure forms of storage equipment and furniture are arranged in very  
compact layouts. Figure 28.8 shows a typical layout for a storage  
area fitted out with ranks of secure display cases. Figure 28.9 shows a  
secure storage area with open-floor storage for larger collection items.

# 5 INTERPRETATION, COMMUNICATION AND  
# DISPLAY  
# 5.1 Strategy  
The communications strategy of the museum should be determined  
at an early stage. The relative importance and coordination of exhi-  
bition, education, publication, live interpretation and other forms of  
direct communication with the public are the essential factors that will  
determine the interface between staff and public. It is not sufficient to  
consider only the relationship between visitor and displayed collec-  
tions; a wide variety of media are now used in museum exhibitions  
to enrich interpretation and facilitate communication with the visit-  
ing public – graphic display, audio-visual, theatre, video, computer  
graphics, digital media, animatronics, tableau and reconstruction, and **28-4 Museums, art galleries and temporary exhibition spaces**  
working environments. Once beyond the stage of producing a general  
scheme it is important to consult an exhibition designer and a museum  
consultant to explore the matrix of interactions between people, infor-  
mation and collections that must be accommodated.

*exhibits may have buffering material against changes in*  
*relative humidity\); d\) Lighting; e\) Interpretive material\: label,*  
*graphic information, sound, audio-visual, kinetic device,*  
*interactive device*  
A wide range of academic expertise may be brought to bear in the  
interpretation of collections for exhibition purposes. Within the  
framework that the initial consultations provide, informed decisions  
may be made regarding the interpretive process and techniques,  
and the choice of media and types of exhibit to be employed. Figure  
28.10 shows a broad typology of exhibit and media installations,  
and Figure 28.11 indicates the physical elements associated with  
exhibits. A design for a temporary exhibition at the Museum of  
London is shown in Figure 28.12. Reference should be made to  
the anthropometric data in Chapter 2 in determining coordinating  
dimensions; for example, the range of eye levels represented in the  
visiting population.  
**28.10** *Exhibits may be of four basic types\: a\), b\), c\) Hanging or*  
*wall mounted; d\), e\) Free-standing and open exhibits; f\), g\), h\)*  
*Contained exhibits and display cases*  
# 6 ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION  
# 6.1 Relative humidity and temperature  
Special consideration must be given to proper control of relative  
humidity, temperature and air pollution in all collection areas of a  
museum or art gallery. This includes exhibition areas; collection  
storage; and conservation, display and photographic work areas.  
Passive, low-tech approaches may be considered where climate  
and the inertia of the building allow. Full air conditioning may be  
required to cope with climatic extremes, even in this case the build-  
ing envelope should provide a sufficient buffering effect to prevent  
sudden changes in relative humidity during periods of repair or  
maintenance. Figure 28.13 shows suitable conditions in museums, **Museums, art galleries and temporary exhibition spaces 28-5**  
**28.12** *Layout for the Estuary temporary exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands, designed by Urban Salon. Key\: 1\) Open space*  
*for fine art exhibits; 2\) Enclosed space for screen based video artists; 3\) Long open flat surfacing for a series of flat works; 4\) Staggered*  
*entrance for minimal light and sound spill for projection artists*  
while Table I gives the ranges of museum interior temperature and  
relative humidity recommended in various climatic zones.  
# 6.2 Air pollution  
Information about local air quality should be sought and used to  
decide on the appropriate approach to control. If air filtration is  
necessary it should not be of the electrostatic type, as malfunction  
can result in the generation of highly damaging ozone levels.  
# 6.3 Light and lighting  
Museum lighting is a complex subject. It is important, particu-  
larly in art museums, to determine a clear policy on the approach  
to natural and artificial lighting. Direct sunlight should not fall  
on any collection item and UV radiation must be effectively  
eliminated from all light reaching a collection item\: at the higher  
energy end of the spectrum light is very effective in initiating  
chemical change in vulnerable materials. The maximum light  
dosage recommended for different categories of collection item  
is summarised in Table II. These dosages are normally achieved  
by limiting the level of illumination on collection items during  
visiting hours to 50 lux per annum on the most sensitive material  
such as paper, textile, watercolour and 200 lux on other sensitive  
materials such as wood, leather and oil paint.  
The eye has a limited ability to adapt to changes in brightness,  
and as the visitor moves through the museum sudden changes in  
lighting levels and extreme contrasts of brightness in the field of  
view should be avoided. However, a reasonable range of contrast  
should be maintained in conditions of low illumination to prevent a  
dull effect and possible problems of visual accommodation.  
# 6.4 Acoustics and zoning  
The transport of sound through structure should be controlled.  
Functional zones should be provided with surface or sub-surface  
materials that dampen impact sounds and isolating cavities to inter-  
rupt the structural transmission of sound. Noise levels should be  
controlled within zones by appropriate choices of material finishes **28-6 Museums, art galleries and temporary exhibition spaces**  
on floors, walls and ceilings, and the shaping of interior spaces to  
prevent flutter and unwanted amplifying effects. To generalise and  
simplify, the penetration of low-frequency sound is lessened by  
structural mass, of middle frequencies by diffusing and absorbing  
surfaces, and of high-frequency sound by the elimination of small-  
scale air gaps in doors, windows and partition walls.  
# 7 SECURITY AND SERVICES  
# 7.1 Security  
Many security problems can be avoided by keeping the number  
of access points to the site and to the building to a minimum. The  
ideal is one public entrance monitored by information staff and/  
or attendants, and one staff entrance controlled by the security

staff responsible for key control and the checking of deliveries and  
outside contractors. Security staffing is also considerably more  
effective and economic if all exhibition and open storage areas are  
on one level.  
# 7.2 Secure areas  
The health and safety of the public and the staff and collection secu-  
rity are the prime considerations in determining the zoning of the  
museum into secure areas. During open hours, it may be sufficient  
to separate public and staff areas. When the museum is closed to  
the public, it is normal to secure more specific zones, for example\:  
1 Entrance, orientation/information, shop, café and toilets/cloak-  
rooms  
2 Temporary and permanent exhibitions – in larger museums sub-  
divided into several secure exhibit areas  
3 Educational facilities, lecture theatre, study collections  
4 Offices\: administration, curatorial, conservation, design, etc.  
5 Conservation workshops, laboratories, photographic facilities  
6 Collection storage, security staff areas, collection packing and  
inspection areas  
7 Exhibition and maintenance workshops.  
# 7.3 Services  
For general guidance, see appropriate chapters in this book. In  
addition, special consideration should be given to minimising the  
risk to the collections when locating service installations and rout-  
ing service ducts. For example, water and waste pipes should not be  
routed near collection storage and exhibition areas.  
Risk management is also greatly enhanced if a separate heating/  
air conditioning system or independent control system is provided  
in collection areas.  
# 8.2 Site  
The site was a 72 m × 10 m gallery within the Grade I listed Aston  
Webb interior. The listing meant that all work had to be fully  
reversible, and required planning and listed building consent for  
the introduction of new air handling plant. Internally, the original  
interior cabinetry had to be removed and stored off site.  
# 8.3 Challenges  
The biggest challenge was creating a display solution that would allow  
so many diverse exhibits to sit well together. Another issue was the  
gallery plan. Since the gallery can be entered at either end, the content  
needed to legible in both directions. Also, the narrow shape of the plan  
meant that careful consideration of visitor flow was required while at  
the same time maintaining ample viewing distances from the objects.  
Because of the length and linear nature of the gallery, it was important  
to provide a varied rhythm of experience in order to retain interest.  
Exacting conservation strategies were also required to respond  
to light sensitive content, with a maximum average annual daylight  
exposure of 50–70 lux stipulated. For a top-lit gallery on a north-  
south axis, this implied extensive solar shading.  
# 8.4 Design solution  
The arrangement of objects was given a tripartite hierarchy to aid  
legibility. A chronological display created a spine to the exhibition  
along the centre of the gallery, Figure 28.14. Around the perimeter  
walls, objects were divided into sections, each addressing a distinct  
manufacturing technique, Figure 28.15.  
# 8 CASE STUDY  
Project\: The Dr Susan Weber Furniture Gallery, Victoria and  
Albert Museum, South Kensington, London  
Design\: Nord Architecture  
# 8.1 Introduction  
The Victoria and Albert Museum commissioned Nord Architecture  
to design a 720 sqm permanent gallery for furniture and fabrication  
techniques. Completed in 2012 with a budget of £1.4 million, the  
Dr Susan Weber Gallery shows more than 250 objects from the  
past 500 years.  
**28.15** *Completed gallery, with display portals down either side*  
**28.14** *Section \(top\) and plan, showing perimeter wall displays and central plinths* **28-8 Museums, art galleries and temporary exhibition spaces**  
To provide buffering between each display and variety within the  
linear display, a series of framed openings or portals each meas-  
uring 1800 mm × 3650 mm was inserted along the length of the  
gallery, each focusing on an individual furniture maker. The portals  
followed the height, width and thickness of the existing black mar-  
ble door architraves at either end of the gallery. This allowed them  
to be read as a perceptual ‘doorway’ inviting the visitor to enter the  
world of the maker, Figure 28.16.  
A monochrome colour scheme created a holistic backdrop to the  
multitude of timber objects and materials. Ebonised oak strip was  
used throughout to form the plinths, portals and frieze. To contrast  
with this, white Corian linings were used for display space, cabinet  
linings and plinth tops.  
Displays were kept to 350 mm off finished floor level to provide  
a suitable height for wheelchair viewers. Digital captions and audio  
points are 700 mm off finished floor level.  
# 8.5 Interpretation  
Each technique display was given a dedicated interpretive ledge  
to introduce the visitor to the process behind the technique. Films/  
touch objects/samples/illustrations and historical precedents were  
collated in groups to impart better understanding of the technique  
**28.16** *Detail of display portal* from the perspective of the maker. To limit captioning, digital  
touch labels were introduced within bespoke housings – the first  
digital labels at the museum.  
Each portal incorporated an audio point with a selection of  
recordings from architects and designers describing the maker’s  
relevance today. At the centre of the gallery, two interactive work-  
benches allow visitors to explore materials and their production  
processes.

designed, constructed and operated. For the first time, large floor  
plates were required to accommodate a rising number of clerical  
workers, equipped with the increasingly sophisticated technology  
of the typewriter and the telegraph, followed quite quickly by the  
telephone and the copier.  
The complementary roles of both office developer and facili-  
ties manager first emerged here along with a series of divisions of  
labour between the roles of architects, mechanical and electrical  
engineers, space planners and facilities managers, defined by how  
long each layer of designed artefacts was intended to last.  
North American offices continued to become ever larger and  
more sophisticated, both architecturally and technologically,  
during the first half of the twentieth century, as is evident in the  
many magnificent, very often high-rise structures, designed by  
such architects as Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, Philip  
Johnson and SOM. Meanwhile, British office buildings remained  
until the early 1980s a provincial variant of US practice, smaller,  
less efficient in construction and plan form, less well serviced and  
more influenced by developers, letting agents and external plan-  
ning considerations than by the internal operational requirements  
of occupiers.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 The historical office  
The office emerged as a distinct building type in the latter half of  
the nineteenth century. Previously, what would now be classed  
as office functions, especially those that were an adjunct to gov-  
ernment, had often been accommodated literally in palaces such  
as the Uffizi in Florence. Somerset House in London, partly built  
to accommodate the Admiralty, followed a similar model. In the  
private sector, lawyers had worked for centuries in the quasi-colle-  
giate environment of the Inns of Court. Sir John Soane’s Bank of  
England is an early example of a very large, purpose-built office  
complex of a very specific kind. By contrast, much early office  
work was peripatetic. Early members of the Corporation of Lloyds,  
the pioneer of the insurance market, conducted much of their busi-  
ness in adjacent, publicly accessible coffee houses, the Starbucks  
of their day.  
# 1.2 The office building type  
When the office building emerged as an independent building  
type in the United States in the latter part of the nineteenth cen-  
tury, it was distinctive physically in terms of large floor plates and  
increasingly high-rise structures but also in the very specific ways  
in which such purpose-designed office buildings were financed,

# 1.3 European office innovation  
Two very different and original office design concepts developed  
in Northern Europe in the 1960s and 1970s\:  
• *Burolandschaft* \(office landscaping\) – introduced by the  
*Organisationteam Schnelle* in the early 1960s in Germany;  
see Figure 29.1. This was largely based on studies of inter-  
nal patterns of communication within organisations. User data  
led to free-flowing, open plan arrangements of workstations  
and meeting areas. One external corollary was a deliberately  
non-orthogonal architecture. Such developments were fuelled  
both by the presence of more independently owned businesses  
in Germany compared to the US, who were in a position to  
develop their own office buildings, and by the power of  
Workers’ Councils with the constitutional right to be consulted  
on changes in working conditions. Consequently, it became  
customary from the 1960s onwards, not just in Germany but  
also in Holland and Scandinavia, for office buildings to be pur-  
pose-designed from the inside out. Not only were many of the  
resulting buildings striking in architectural terms but internally  
they became spatially generous, often carpeted \(rare until the  
1970s in both the UK and USA\) and much more domestic in  
feeling than corporate. Plants and colour were important inte-  
rior features as were informal rest areas, called *Pausenraumen*,  
for refreshment, relaxation or informal, extempore conversa-  
tions with colleagues.  
• Office as city – a similar divergence from the top-down cul-  
ture of the corporate office was experienced in Holland and  
Scandinavia in the 1970s and 1980s. A key project in Holland  
was Herman Hertzberger’s office for Centraal Beheer, an  
independent insurance company in Apeldoorn. This was  
conceived as a microcosm of an Italian hill town with  
strong internal as well as external architectural features –  
mini atria, columns and low walls – intersected and held  
together by internal streets. This created a network of small,  
semi-enclosed, interlocking places that the ‘inhabitants’ were  
encouraged to appropriate in their own way in order to make  
the office as homelike and personal as possible. This created  
a radically different, user sensitive and, to many workers,  
a highly attractive office culture. Niels Torp’s celebrated  
headquarters buildings for the airline SAS on the outskirts  
of Stockholm, see Figure 29.2, and for British Airways near  
Heathrow were also conceived as little cities, with office  
pavilions on either side of an attractive, top-lit, internal  
‘street’. Many similar offices were erected in Scandinavia,  
Holland and Germany, but far fewer in the United Kingdom  
and the rest of Europe.  
# 1.4 The global office  
In London in the late 1970s and early 1980s, developers such as  
Stuart Lipton and Godfrey Bradman realised that an entirely new  
class of office building would be necessary to accommodate glo-  
balising organisations, particularly in the financial services sector.  
Such accommodation would allow occupiers to take maximum  
advantage of London’s location in an intermediate time zone  
that permits overlapping daily communications with both Asia  
and North America. This led to the initial, immediate success of  
Canary Wharf and Broadgate and, cumulatively since the 1980s,  
the economy of the City of London and the capital as a whole; see  
Figure 29.3.  
Table I summarises the planning and design criteria for these  
different generations and locations of office buildings.  
# 1.5 Facilities management  
Facilities management \(FM\) is a North American concept and was  
an essential factor in the development of the office in the last cen-  
tury. FM skills may be considered as the software that enables the  
efficient and effective management and use of office space over  
time. Facilities managers tend to be undervalued, or at best taken  
for granted, partly because of the perceived difficulty of measur-  
ing their positive impact on business performance. However, this  
is changing with the development of more scientifically conducted  
case studies.

# 1.6 Information technology  
By contrast, the impact of information technology on business  
performance is dominant and is now highly visible in practically  
every sector of the economy. IT mobility has revolutionised how  
we work, leading to a wide variety of work settings rather than just  
the individual desk.  
# 2 MATCHING SUPPLY AND DEMAND  
# 2.1 Office type variety  
The idea that there should be a single, definitive model for all office  
buildings, let alone for office interiors, is demonstrably outdated.  
The current different types can be summarised as\:  
• High quality, architect-designed corporate office space with  
many amenities to attract young talent for sophisticated  
global hi-tech organisations such as Apple, Google and  
Microsoft.  
• Speculative, capable of utilisation in a mix of cellular/open plan  
workspace.  
• Alternative, individualised and often highly informal workplace  
cultures, for entrepreneurial, technology-led enterprises, such  
as those at the so-called ‘Silicon Roundabout’ around London’s  
Old Street. These often re-utilise existing buildings. **29-4** **Offices**  
**Table I** **Planning and design criteria for different types of office building**  
**29.4** *The Hub, at New Zealand House in Central London, is an example of a shared workspace increasingly popular with start-up*  
*companies buying a service rather than space*  
• Shared/hotelling workspaces – where space and services can **2.2 Supply chain**  
be hired within a communitarian atmosphere, often by start-up Modes of delivery and space management are also changing beyond  
businesses, for the day, the week or the month. Examples include the conventional Anglo Saxon real estate supply chain. This starts

The exploratory process of creating new kinds of workplace is hand the project on to project managers and the construction indus-  
by no means over as increasingly powerful technologies continue try after which corporate real estate, facilities managers, IT and  
to be developed and different cultural and organisational stimuli human resources take over. Eventually, projects are handed over to  
present themselves. users who, in the past, have been barely consulted. At its worst, this supply chain is unidirectional, unstoppable, mono-functional and,  
above all, characterised by minimal, even zero, feedback.  
# 2.3 Demand and supply  
Figure 29.5 shows how demand and supply should be connected  
operationally. What is important here is the emphasis on feedback  
and the reconciliation of user demands \(expressed through space and  
furniture standards, filing and information strategies, requirements  
for ancillary and support as well as design guidelines\) with supply  
side features such as space planning and structural grids, depth of  
space, configuration and size of floors, and number of storeys.  
# 2.4 Improving user satisfaction, health and comfort  
A good workplace building may be defined as one that satisfies through  
time both end user and organisational needs at reasonable cost, without  
unnecessary effort and within which, above all, occupants are happy to  
work. To achieve these goals three key features are required\:  
• *Adaptability* – to meet an open-ended range of spatial and ser-  
vicing requirements. In addition to shell and core standards of  
provision, offices could, for the benefit of occupants, accommo-  
date a wide range of choice in internal environmental services,  
such as natural ventilation and control of up-lighters.  
• *Contact with the outside world* – many people like being adja-  
cent to openable windows with clear glass. In Scandinavia and  
Germany this is having a major influence on office building  
design, often resulting in office spaces arranged around a core or  
‘street’ of common facilities.  
• *Healthier and more stimulating internal environments* – many  
people find natural ventilation more acceptable than mechanical  
systems especially if they are able to control airflow and tempera-  
ture, and benefit from a healthier and more stimulating environment.  
# 3 STANDARD METHOD OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT  
# 3.1 Common terms  
The following terms, see Figure 29.6, are often used to specify  
floor area requirements \(see BCO Guide to Specification\). These  
are also incorporated into the International Property Measurement  
Standards \(IPMS\), drawn up by The Royal Institution of Chartered  
Surveyors and other global organisations \(see also Chapter 5  
Capital and whole life costs of buildings, Section 4.3\)\:  
• *Gross External Area \(GEA\)*\: the floor area contained within the  
building measured to the external face of the external walls.  
• *Gross Internal Area \(GIA\)*\: the floor area contained within the  
building measured to the Internal Dominant Face. This is defined  
by the IPMS as the inside finished surface comprising 50 per  
cent or more of the surface area for each vertical section forming  
an internal perimeter; see Figure 29.7.  
• In both the aforementioned gross measures, features such as  
atria are calculated at the filled floor level – clear voids are not  
included in the total area. However, enclosed plant rooms are  
included in all gross measures.  
• *Net Internal Area \(NIA\)*\: GIA less floor areas taken up by\:  
− Common lobbies and foyers  
− Enclosed plant on roofs  
− Stairs and escalators  
− Mechanical and electrical services plant areas  
− Lifts  
− Internal structure such as columns  
− Toilet areas  
− Functions within the core enclosure  
− Ducts and risers  
− Car parking is included in gross area.  
An additional term sometimes encountered is Net Office Area  
\(NOA\). This is NIA less main corridors and other primary  
**Offices** **29-5**  
**29.5** *Reconciling demand and supply*  
**29.6** *Standard method of measurement*  
circulation, that is, the routes required to maintain life safety in  
emergencies. Secondary circulation to provide access to worksta-  
tions off main corridors is included in NOA.  
# 3.2 The space budget  
From the user’s perspective, the components of a space budget are\:  
• *Workspace*\: area given over to individual and shared worksta-  
tions, work settings and occupants’ immediate requirements  
such as personal filing – although more and more of this is now  
accessible electronically.  
• *Ancillary space*\: area given over to functions that are managed  
by and support departments or working groups, including local  
meeting places, project rooms, storage areas, shared equipment,  
refreshment and copy areas. Such shared resources are increas-  
ing as a proportion of occupied space.  
• *Support space*\: area given over to functions that are centrally  
managed and support the whole organisation or building, includ-  
ing mail, reprographics, network rooms, switchboard rooms,  
library, conference, central meeting and so forth. Such areas may  
be located on separate floors or otherwise distant from individual  
departments or groups.  
Office buildings in use are rarely, if ever, 100 per cent efficient  
for two prime reasons\:  
• Building configuration, grids and obstructions  
• The operational imperative of maintaining departmental integrity.  
Consequently, in the calculation of space requirements a ‘Fit  
Factor’ – say 5 per cent or even 10 per cent depending on the con-  
figuration of the space to be occupied – should be added to the  
schedule of accommodation required; see Figure 29.8. **29-6** **Offices**  
**29.7** *Definition of Internal Dominant Face from International Property Measurement Standards\: Office Buildings. Source\: International*  
*Property Measurement Standards Coalition, 2015. All rights reserved* **29.8** *The space budget represents the organisation’s requirement*  
*for Net Usable Area*  
Meanwhile, more mobile ways of working and increasingly  
shared spatial resources are having a profound effect on such cal-  
culations of space requirements.  
# 4 THE TIME-BASED NATURE OF THE OFFICE  
# ENVIRONMENT  
# 4.1 Timescales  
Buildings are relatively permanent entities unlike organisations within  
which activities and routines are continually changing. To allow for  
maximum flexibility, it is helpful to distinguish four different times-  
cales, see Figure 29.9, related to building briefing and design\:  
• *The building shell* – the structure and enclosure of the building  
which conventionally lasts perhaps 60 years. Within the same  
period, operational functions are certain to change many times  
over. The ability of a shell to accommodate change is a func-  
tion of depth of space, location of cores, floor-to-floor height to  
provide capacity to accommodate services as well as the config-  
uration of the floor plate.  
• *Building services* – the heating, ventilation and cabling infra-  
structure of a building, which usually has a life span of 15 years –  
or even less as technology becomes obsolescent and equipment  
has to be replaced.  
• *Scenery* – the fitting out components of a building such as ceil-  
ings, lighting, finishes, which are used to adapt a building to  
tenants’ \(or departmental\) changing requirements. Typically, the  
life span of an office fit-out is between 5 and 7 years.  
**29.9** *Different building timescales*  
**Offices** **29-7**  
• *Settings* – the increasingly important day-to-day rearrangement  
of furniture and equipment, to meet ever-changing needs.  
These terms, which are now in common use, have been coined  
because they relate office design to scenography, that is, to the  
time-based rearrangement of settings behind the proscenium arch  
during theatrical performances.  
# 4.2 Office mobility  
Paper-based office work was relatively slow moving and often  
static. Storage and retrieval of non-electronic documents were  
important as was the provision of meeting places for customers,  
suppliers and consultants as well as for the organisation’s own  
staff. However, information technology has changed the pace, the  
timetable and the location of office work.  
The most striking impact is that office workers have become  
much more mobile both within and away from the office. Hourly  
measurements of the actual occupancy of individual workstations  
over the working day in many different kinds of business have  
shown that this rarely rises above 40 per cent at peak times and,  
in many cases over the day as a whole, much less; see Figure  
29.10\. Evidence of office workers being present but not at their  
workplace – for example, a coat left over a chair – may appear to  
add another 10 or 20 per cent to occupancy levels, but it is safe  
to say that most workplaces and offices are mostly empty for at  
least half of the working day. Similarly, while meeting rooms are  
often fully booked, even more frequently they are observed to be  
empty.  
# 4.3 An office revolution  
The space planning and urbanistic implications of such demo-  
graphic findings are profound. If information technology is making  
it possible for an increasing proportion of staff to work at least  
some of the time away from the office, not necessarily incidentally  
at home, the residual role of office accommodation is likely to be as  
social and communications centres within and between businesses.  
Such offices are likely to be occupied in very different ways over  
very different timescales.  
These trends have important urbanistic implications. If offices  
are indeed half empty most of time, as seems to be the case  
already in many instances, the same cannot be said of cities. Like  
many other cities worldwide, city centres such as Manhattan or  
Central London have become more vibrant than ever before and  
over longer timescales – the opposite of what has been observed  
inside office buildings. Attention must be given to the program-  
ming and design of an urban fabric that would foster a business  
and intellectual community that operates for much of the time  
between, as well as within, distinct office organisations and  
buildings. **29-8** **Offices**  
**29.10** *Time utilisation surveys show that actual desk occupancy is less than might be expected*  
# 5 THE OFFICE SHELL  
# 5.1 Needs  
Building owners and facilities managers usually prioritise the fol-  
lowing specification requirements\:  
• The ability to accommodate change and minimise operating costs  
• Freedom to address users’ expectations for environmentally  
friendly working conditions  
• Local environmental control  
• Ease of maintenance  
• The opportunity to allow users to participate in design decisions.  
# 5.2 Dimensions  
The dimensions recommended in this section are based on those  
recommended by the BCO, and on what many facilities managers  
believe to be good practice. However, in some circumstances, such  
as inner city sites, different approaches may be appropriate to com-  
ply with planning restrictions or to ensure financial viability.  
# 5.3 Floor depth  
This determines the quality and dimensions of space to be provided at  
every level. Aspect, natural ventilation and lighting, zoning of activ-  
ities and of support spaces should all be considered. Building depths  
are usually measured as either ‘glass-to-core’ or ‘glass-to-glass’\:  
• A glass-to-core dimension of 9–12 m allows room for cellular  
office space or open plan plus circulation and storage  
• A glass-to-glass dimension of 13.5–18 m allows two or three  
zones of office, circulation and support space.  
# 5.4 Storey height  
Related to floor depth and floor plate dimensions, storey height  
\(floor-to-floor height\) has a major impact on air conditioning, cable  
distribution, occupants’ ability to have access to natural ventilation  
and daylight, as well as on visual comfort\:  
• Floor-to-floor heights of 4–4.5 m provide more flexibility as well  
as visual comfort. However, a typical height of 2.75 m from fin-  
ished floor level to underside of ceiling is still considered good  
practice.  
Floor depth and storey height are interrelated and, assuming  
glass-to-glass depths of 13.5–18 m, should be thought of together.  
For example, narrower buildings do not require such generous storey  
heights because of the different servicing strategies that they use.  
# 5.5 Floor sizes and configurations  
These affect circulation and internal communication. Smaller  
floors are less efficient in terms of the ratio between the area of  
cores and usable floor space. They can also lead to splitting larger  
departments over several floors. Very large floor plates can create  
extended circulation and longer distances between departments\:  
• Large floor plates of 2500 m2 and over tend to be favoured by  
larger organisations. However, dealing rooms can be much bigger  
• Landlord efficiency \(the ratio between NIA and GIA\) should be  
84–87 per cent in mid- to high-rise or 90 per cent in low-rise  
buildings  
• Tenant efficiency, expressed as the ratio between Usable Area  
and NIA, should be 85 per cent or above; see Figure 29.11.  
**29.11** *Tenant efficiency*  
# 5.6 Floor loading  
This determines the amount of equipment and storage that can be  
placed in the work area while preserving the overall stability of the  
structure. The tendency in the UK and certain other parts of Europe  
has been to over-specify floor loadings, thus adding significantly to  
construction costs\:  
• The BCO recommends 2.5 kN/m2, with hardened areas for extra  
weight of up to 7 kN/m2, but says that institutions demand ranges  
of 3 to 4 kN/m2  
.  
# 5.7 Planning and partition grids  
Planning grids determine the size of enclosed offices and other  
enclosures as well as providing an overall modular discipline  
for many other design decisions that help determine the ongoing efficiency of space use, even in what may have been originally  
intended to be completely open offices\:  
• A 1.35 m grid allows 2.7 m wide minimum office enclosures  
\(relatively rare in the UK\)  
• A 1.5 m grid allows 3 m wide offices that are much more common  
and have the additional advantage of relating well to 600 mm build-  
ing components. This grid is much used in office planning in the UK  
• Structural grids should relate to space planning grids as well as  
to wider economic, engineering and environmental factors. It  
is not necessarily the case that fewer columns are always bet-  
ter. However, decisions about structural grids should always be  
tested during the design process against a wide range of typical  
patterns of enclosure and desk layouts.  
# 5.8 Building skin  
The role of office building skins is shifting from being designed  
solely as barriers to the external environment to becoming an inte-  
gral part of overall servicing and environmental strategies.  
Natural ventilation controlled by end users has long been pop-  
ular in Northern Europe \(see Section 6\) – and is likely to become  
a more common feature of British offices, particularly away from  
city centres. The provision of cross ventilation can be a critically  
important determinant of office building depth.  
# 5.9 Communications infrastructure  
We live in the information age. Hence, local- and wide-area com-  
munications have become an increasingly important factor at every  
level of office design. Office building shells and services should  
be designed to accommodate them. Particularly significant are the  
provision of main entry points for external communications and  
ensuring that the size and location of vertical risers are adequate\:  
• Risers for voice data and other services should not take up less  
than 2 per cent of Gross Floor Area \(GFA\) and the capacity  
should be provided to knock through easily at least another 2 per  
cent should the need arise  
• Cores containing risers should be widely distributed to avoid  
cable bottlenecks  
• Cores should be accessible from common parts and primary cir-  
culation routes in order to provide options for multi-tenancy  
• Communications rooms serving the entire building or major  
tenants measuring 2 × 2 m for each 500 m2 of GFA should be  
adequate and located at a distance suitable for the adopted data/  
communication system  
• There should be space for dual-service entries into the building  
• Provision should be made on the roof, or nearby, for satellite or  
microwave dishes with good sight lines  
• Provision of alternative access to power supplies and communi-  
cations. Security and continuity of access is a critically important  
consideration given that office organisations of all kinds are now  
more or less totally dependent upon electronic networks commu-  
nication system.  
# 5.10 Access for goods and materials  
Ease of access for the entry of goods through loading bays and  
goods lifts must be at least as good as access for people to avoid  
conflicts and bottlenecks. A clear strategy for entry supported  
by appropriate signage should keep people and goods separate.  
Typical materials regularly delivered are\:  
• Refuse and recycling  
• Stationery and office supplies  
• Office equipment, machinery and furniture  
• Food and supplies to dining areas, vending machines and so forth  
• Post and courier deliveries  
• Building maintenance supplies and equipment.

# 5.12 Sectional considerations  
Following Northern European practice, internal atria, small or  
large, linking several floors via prominent staircases, are becoming  
increasingly common. The purpose of such atria is to enhance the  
potential for interdepartmental movement and interaction. In some  
cases, building in the possibility of creating such three-dimensional  
access is provided in the design even of the structure of speculative  
office buildings. However, real estate efficiency has to be balanced  
against potential longer-term operational advantages.  
# 6 BUILDING SERVICES  
# 6.1 Natural ventilation or air conditioning?  
There is usually a straight choice between natural ventilation and  
full air conditioning for both speculative and purpose-built offices.  
In the UK, many organisations choose the latter, although the con-  
sequences can be twice the building services energy costs and more  
expensive building maintenance and management. Not all these  
costs are directly related to the air conditioning system but to the  
characteristics of the types of buildings that are air conditioned.  
Apart from improved comfort \(not always realised\), reasons for  
choosing air conditioning include\:  
• Prestige  
• Standard requirements, particularly for multinationals  
• Deeper plans, partly for alleged organisational needs and partly  
to maximise usable area  
• Flexibility to accommodate changing requirements – seldom  
achieved except at high cost  
• Higher rents giving a better rate of return  
• Poor external environments, particularly traffic noise.  
# 6.2 New trends  
Trends in office design have moved away from climate respon-  
sive forms, designed as coarse climate modifiers, towards climate  
rejecting, sealed designs within which the internal environment is  
created largely, and often entirely, artificially. This design strategy  
is now being questioned. Pointers for the future include\:  
• More powerful and reliable electronic communications systems  
and networks are raising questions about the long-term opera-  
tional value of large, deep, environmentally controlled buildings  
and spaces. Not least because patterns of occupancy are chang-  
ing because of more mobile ways of working.  
• Many occupants are expecting environments that are more natu-  
ral, providing greater outside awareness, more daylight, natural  
ventilation and better individual control. These environments can  
be supported where appropriate by supplementary mechanical **29-10** **Offices**  
and electrical systems that are available on demand, including  
opening windows and solar controls linked to computerised  
building management systems. Such systems monitor the open-  
ing of windows so that heating, ventilation and air conditioning  
systems can be reconfigured as required.  
• In difficult conditions, especially in the inner city, it may not  
be possible to have opening windows, but some form of solar  
protection should always be incorporated to minimise cooling  
loads.  
• New materials, systems and design techniques permit closer  
integration of natural and mechanical systems with intelligent  
user-responsive controls that allow buildings which are not fully  
air conditioned to provide greater environmental control than  
ever before.  
• Concern for the global environment implies greater energy effi-  
ciency through natural ventilation, light and solar heat rather  
than conventional mechanical and electrical systems.  
• Energy consumption by desktop IT equipment is falling, reduc-  
ing cooling loads in the general office though not necessarily in  
equipment rooms.  
# 7 SCENERY AND SETTING OPTIONS  
# 7.1 Layouts  
Layouts must balance the desire for cellularisation \(common in  
Germany and Scandinavian offices\) against the need to keep costs  
down and to add value with strongly interactive work patterns in  
open plan settings. Open areas should be designed and managed  
to allow quiet and reflective work, and the flexible use of space at  
different times. Using IT to allow mobile working within the office  
makes possible entirely new ways of planning space.  
Layouts should\:  
• Maximise both communication and the need for quiet and  
reflection  
• Accommodate team and project work and also provide space for  
confidential and individual work  
• Provide access to daylight, aspect and ventilation.  
# 7.2 Typologies  
Three typical office typologies and their densities are shown here\:  
highly cellular, see Figure 29.12, 90/10 open plan/cellular, see  
Figure 29.13, and open plan, see Figure 29.14. In Figure 29.14,  
desk provision is at 1\:1, although many organisations now provide  
fewer desks than headcount and operate desk-sharing strategies in  
order to match true levels of occupation.  
# 7.3 Meeting rooms and collaborative spaces  
These are key areas in any organisation. As well as formal meet-  
ing areas, see Figure 29.15, and informal meeting areas, see Figure  
29.16, breakout areas are increasingly important, and may include  
sofas, banquettes, beanbags as well as traditional seating.  
# 7.4 Individual settings  
Many offices incorporate a variety of workplace settings for staff  
and visitors aside from the traditional desk such as bench seating,  
see Figure 29.17, focus rooms, see Figure 29.18, and touchdown  
areas, see Figures 29.19a and b.  
# 7.5 Space and circulation  
Figures 29.20a, b and c show typical distances and requirements for  
accessing storage cabinets. Copy areas are shown in Figures 29.21a  
and b.

# 7.6 Servicing strategy  
Power and communication services can be taken to each worksta-  
tion and meeting place in either\:  
• Raised floors; see Figure 29.22 or  
• Perimeter ducting connected to cable management systems  
within furniture and screens; see Figure 29.23.  
Raised floors are popular with UK developers, which is surprising  
as it is the most expensive method. Unless an unacceptably low ceil-  
ing is provided, it means that the floor-to-floor height is increased by  
the depth of the raised floor. Power and telecommunication outlets  
are in sunken boxes accessed through flaps with slots for the flexes.  
These boxes have a capacity limited by their size, and usually only  
have room for three power sockets and a double telephone socket. It  
is not that easy or cheap to provide more boxes, or to move the ones  
that are there, so that furniture and screen arrangements tend to be  
fixed in relation to them. Sometimes boxes find themselves within  
major traffic routes, where they can cause a hazard.  
Perimeter ducting is a system particularly suitable for smaller  
naturally ventilated offices without suspended ceilings. However,  
it does make moving the furniture and screens difficult, and can  
inhibit easy movement between workspaces.  
Two other methods have been used in the past, but are no longer  
recommended. Ducts in the thickness of the floor screed require  
service outlets above floor level; and these can only be adjacent to  
the duct positions. These totally control the placing of furniture and  
pedestrian routes. An even worse system is to have the cables in  
the suspended ceiling below the floor in question. This means that  
when changes have to be made, construction work has to be done  
on a different floor, which may be occupied by a totally different  
organisation. **Offices** **29-13**

# 8 TRADING FLOORS  
# 8.1 Organisation  
The model for trading floors is regimented rows of desks, see  
Figure 29.24, to condense the greatest number of traders in close  
proximity, primarily to promote face-to-face communication and  
facilitate the integration of technology.  
# 8.2 Desk design  
The desk footprint is affected by three factors\:  
• Ergonomics/BS standards  
• Accommodating technology and equipment  
• Heat management.  
*Ergonomics/BS standards*  
Refer to BS EN 527–1 for legroom, distance to screen and desktop  
space. This dictates a desktop of a minimum 800 mm deep, that is,  
consistent with contemporary desk standards.  
**29.24** *Trading floor desks*  
*Accommodating technology and equipment*  
Desk design is driven by the number of screens, the preferred  
processing strategy \(CPUs at desk or remote blade\), and the  
requirement to incorporate a dealerboard\:  
• The on-floor cooling demand can be reduced by implementing  
remote processing, which removes the primary heat source from  
the desk to a central location where it can be more effectively  
managed.  
• CPUs accommodated within the void beneath the desk remains  
the preferred processing solution, resulting in a 600 mm deep  
zone central to the desks to house standard PCs.  
• Significantly, there has recently been a reduction in the number  
of screens required. There has been a shift from using multiple  
flat screen monitors sometimes stacked in a cockpit form to the  
introduction of only requiring two large format display screens  
therefore reducing the necessary width of the desk module. This  
has been made possible by improvements in HD providing accu-  
rate representation of on-screen market data.  
• On-screen ‘soft’ dealer boards are now available on most trading  
platforms negating the requirement for a sizeable piece of kit on  
the desktop.  
**29.25** *Floor plenum* **Offices** **29-15**  
• Remote or cloud processing, particularly across wireless net-  
works, is unlikely to have a significant impact on trading floor  
design due to the latency, that is, the fraction-of-a-second delays,  
experienced.  
**29.26** *Overhead chilled beam*  
*Heat management*  
Trading floors inherently generate considerable heat due to the  
amount of screens and processing equipment. Building ser-  
vices will require augmenting to manage this excess. There are  
primarily three solutions for conventional speculative office  
buildings\:  
• Floor plenum – pumping cool air through the raised floor void to  
cool equipment within the desk void via outlets below the desks;  
see Figure 29.25. This requires a sealed base to the desk and a  
minimum raised floor void of 300 mm.  
• Overhead \(Fan Coil Unit \(FCU\) and/or chilled beams\) – less  
efficient than other solutions when used in isolation; see Figure  
29.26\. Performance can be improved by incorporating a ‘chim-  
ney’ to the spine of the desks to duct heated air away from the  
equipment housed in the desk to high level where it can mix with  
the cooler air.  
• Cool desks; see Figure 29.27 – effectively housing an FCU  
within the central spine to the desk to circulate cool air around  
the CPUs/screens and deal with the heat at source. This is an  
efficient way to supplement existing building systems and  
means that standard speculative office buildings can be uti-  
lised for a trading operation since no increased floor void is  
required and there are reduced Category A enhancements at  
high level.  
# 8.3 Future  
Emergence of automated trading and a consequent need for tech-  
nical developers to be embedded within trading teams has seen a  
shift from endless rows to more organic layouts, thereby promoting  
team organisation and interaction. Standardisation of desks, hard-  
ware and software also allows greater mobility of users, which is  
essential for project-focused, team-based work.  
Another consequence of the multi-function trading floor is the  
requirement for alternative, collaborative spaces around the periph-  
ery of the trading floor to support the interactive functions. This  
space was traditionally occupied by managers in offices, but these  
are increasingly likely to want to sit within their teams. There may  
be a requirement for a large flexible meeting room close by, or a  
broadcast facility, to allow the ‘morning call’ briefing session to be  
streamed live to traders’ desktops.  
**29.27** *In desk cooling*  
# 9 CONCLUSION  
Two apparently but not necessarily contradictory meta-trends need  
to be addressed, not just by architects, but by corporate clients as  
well as developers and their agents\:  
• The rising expectations of office workers, especially younger  
people, not just for higher standards of office accommoda-  
tion but for more control of their use of time, workplaces and  
work styles, all of which are having a big impact on office  
design  
• Many clients and more importantly office workers are address-  
ing the emerging reality that – with the emergence of new modes  
of working and new timetables made possible by ubiquitous  
information technology – it is no longer necessary to go to work  
in order to work.  
Such changes raise fundamental questions not just about  
the nature and purpose of office buildings but about what kinds  
of urban development are likely to be appropriate to accom-  
modate the knowledge economy. As the twenty-first century  
progresses, conventional office developments and office buildings –  
mono-functional and based on strict timetables – are likely to be  
replaced by more permeable, responsive and mixed urban struc-  
tures operating in very different timetables. What is already clear is  
that the city is far from obsolete – in fact very much the opposite. **29-16** **Offices**

1 Introduction  
2 General layout and design  
3 Key components  
4 Procurement  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 General  
This chapter covers retail banking premises, post offices, ticket  
desks and government services outlets. These are generally char-  
acterised by\: the need for security of staff, premises and the public  
due to the potential for criminal activity where money is exchanged  
or received over counters, and stored in quantity; customers’  
need privacy and discrete interaction with service providers; the  
exchange of either sensitive or secure information.  
Due to the nature of design procurement for these types of  
buildings, this chapter provides a brief first point of reference  
for a designer who requires general guidance. It does not include  
details of functional space planning or fixtures and fittings, as  
that level of detail is now commonly provided by the individ-  
ual organisations in their particular design manuals and brand  
templates.  
# 1.2 Types  
The building types and facilities included here are\:  
• Banks  
• Building societies  
• Post offices  
• Foreign currency outlets  
• Ticket desks  
• Government services outlets  
• ATMs and ATM lobbies  
• Interview spaces.  
Common factors of all these facilities are the particular need for  
security for both staff and public, the requirement for surveillance  
and protection of the premises, and the balancing of those needs with  
the provision of accessible counter services and interview facilities.  
# 1.3 Customer experience  
What distinguishes these facilities today is the concept of custom-  
er-focused services, where the buildings are not designed to suit  
the internal operations of the organisations but to enable a more  
welcoming aspect and customer experience for the users. The need  
for additional security and application of technology have affected  
all these facilities; but as part of the modern high street retail offer,  
responses to lifestyle trends and the development of accessible  
government services, the open shopfronts of these buildings and  
the customer-friendly services and facilities they provide are key  
aspects in their design.  
# 1.4 Banks  
The way banks now do business and provide for customers’ needs  
is referred to as Retail Banking, making them essentially more like  
shops than traditional banks. There is now less variation in the types  
of bank branch as they move towards providing a more uniform  
set of customer facilities and services. Branches now are likely to  
contain more ATMs than cashiers, and technological developments  
such as internet banking and the universal availability of ATMs in  
retail areas contribute to less dependency on tellers within banks  
for ordinary customer cash transactions.  
The selling of additional products and services and the provi-  
sion of more customer support services such as internet banking  
desks, rather than just over-the-counter money transfers, are a more  
dominant feature of bank branches today. Also, several main banks  
have merged in recent years, resulting in less competition, less  
variety of banks on the high street, and the development of new  
customer service concepts.  
Because each bank organisation has its own corporate brand  
design manual, the figures shown here are indicative of the *princi-*  
*ples* of current trends in bank branch layout.  
# 1.5 Building societies  
Building societies have become more like banks, if not actually  
taken over by mainstream banks. Consequently, they are following  
similar trends in branch design in terms of more welcoming lay-  
outs for their branches incorporating the same key components of  
reception desk, open-desk cashiers and open-plan customer meeting  
rooms. Many still retain the same requirement for secure screened  
cashiers, but they follow banking trends in provision of more ATMs.  
# 1.6 Post offices  
Post offices traditionally provided only counter services related to  
Royal Mail postal and ancillary business, but now provide a full  
range of financial services in order to compete with banks and  
insurance companies. Main city centre post offices now have a cus-  
tomer reception facility, automated ticket queuing operation, open  
counters, chip and pin cash dispensing, and premises generally pro-  
vide a wider provision of stationery retail. Most main branches also  
provide foreign currency exchange.  
There are an increasing number of sub-post offices which are  
operated as franchises within local shops, newsagents and super-  
markets, and for security reasons those branches maintain the  
tradition of secure screened counters, albeit providing the same full  
range of postal and financial services as main city centre offices.  
As with banks, the detailed layout and facilities provided for the  
variety of post office sizes and locations will be specified within a  
design manual.  
# 1.7 Foreign currency and money transfer outlets  
Foreign currency outlets are now provided within a wide variety of  
locations and premises. These include international transport ter-  
minals \(see Chapter 39\), department stores and specialist retailers  
\(see Chapter 34\) as well as, of course, being a service provided  
within post offices. These facilities are basically secure screened  
cash exchange counters.

**30-1** **30-2** **Payment and counselling offices**  
# 1.8 Ticket desks  
Ticket desks in public facilities such as transport, sport and enter-  
tainment venues will often operate and be designed in a similar  
fashion to payment counters within banks. Such facilities would  
include\:  
• Rail, bus and ferry terminals  
• Cinema, theatre and concert box offices  
• Events ticketing agencies  
• Public sports centres  
• Stadia and outdoor sports venues  
• Tourism attractions  
• Museums, art galleries and exhibitions.  
As with banks, there will be a requirement in these buildings for  
ticket desk counters to provide secure ticket selling through protec-  
tive screens or semi-secure open counters.  
# 1.9 Government services outlets  
The following additional types of similar facilities where interview  
and cash exchange are an essential function are\:  
• Local government payment offices \(Council Tax and Housing  
rent payment offices, etc.\)  
• DWP Jobcentre Plus offices  
• DVLA offices  
• HM Revenue and Customs offices  
• Regional passport offices  
• Citizens Advice Bureau offices.  
All of the aforementioned are likely to be included in many of the  
types of public buildings covered by Chapter 16 \(Civic buildings\),  
but their designs are characterised by consisting of dedicated public  
counter services for either payment transactions, customer relations  
services or for the inclusion of customer interview and counselling  
rooms. They require similar levels of public access, security and  
counselling privacy as are provided in banks.  
# 2 GENERAL LAYOUT AND DESIGN  
# 2.1 Banks  
High street banks now are more like shops, following a high street  
retail concept. Whereas in previous decades banks principally  
comprised a relatively small banking hall fronting a secure line  
of screened tellers and vast back-of-house office areas, the trend  
now is for a much more spacious public area with reception desk  
and waiting area, open-desk cashiers dispensing limited amounts  
of cash, together with open-plan meeting rooms, and less need  
for administrative offices. Larger branches will still have secure  
cashier screens, particularly for business banking, but these will be  
arranged to one side or to the rear of the public zone.  
Figure 30.1 shows the relationship and zoning for a retail bank;  
Figure 30.2 illustrates a typical current retail bank concept layout.  
Large shopfront windows aggressively sell their products and ser-  
vices, and spacious interiors give more floor space over to customer  
services and convenience. The shopfront contains a wide display of  
the bank’s products and services, as well as a clear view of the pub-  
lic area, together with ATMs on the street. Some city centre banks  
still have a separate 24-hour lobby for ATMs; this is shown later in  
Figure 30.10. However, the preferred arrangement in current retail  
banking is to combine a number of external ATMs on the street  
with a number of internal ATMs within the main public area. This  
reduces the security risks associates with late-night open lobbies.  
**30.1** *Relationship and zoning diagram for a retail bank* **30.2** *Retail bank concept layout*  
The main public banking area \(about 70 per cent of the floor  
area\) consists of\:  
• Reception desk, which acts as a focal point for customers, in a  
prominent location in the centre of the main public area  
• Waiting area with comfortable lounge seating  
• ATMs and cash/cheque deposit machine \(some banks now  
include automatic pay-in machines accepting coins and cheques\)  
• Internet banking terminals  
• Open cashier counters and/or desks, which dispense limited  
amounts of cash, with space for queuing  
• Customer interview/meeting spaces  
• Enclosed customer meeting rooms.  
Secure back-office area consisting of\:  
• Secure screened cashiers, with space for queuing  
• ATM and deposit machine room  
• Admin area with strong room for safes, for storage and handling  
of cash  
• Staff room and toilets.  
**30.3** *Typical building society layout*  
**Payment and counselling offices** **30-3**  
Architects and designers today are not required to provide an  
original design for a bank, but are expected to use their professional  
skills to integrate a set of standard designed components from a  
corporate brand manual into a site-specific project.  
# 2.2 Building societies  
The design of building societies now reflects that of mainstream  
banks. Smaller branches are still arranged with secure screened  
tellers, although the main public areas are much more customer  
focused in line with bank design trends, incorporating reception  
desk, comfortable waiting area and open-plan customer meeting  
spaces. Figure 30.3 illustrates a typical current building society  
layout.  
# 2.3 Post offices  
The relationship and zoning for a typical main post office is shown  
in Figure 30.4. There will be a requirement for a strong room for  
storage and handling of cash, and for staff facilities, as with banks.  
Also as with banks and building societies, the post offices will be  
designed in detail in accordance with a corporate design manual to  
suit a variety of locations and sizes from a main city centre location **30-4** **Payment and counselling offices**  
**30.4** *Relationship and zoning diagram for a post office*  
to a local sub-post office operated by private enterprises as a fran-  
chise within a retail store.  
Figure 30.5 shows the layout of a typical main post office,  
which includes a sorting office and parcel-collect facility. The main  
public area of a city centre post office now includes a substantial  
stationery retail zone, and for the counter services, there will be  
an electronic queuing system attended by a member of staff. The  
main counters will be open-style with chip and pin cash dispensing  
facilities, and a separate foreign currency outlet will be provided by  
means of a secure screen cashier as elsewhere. In sub-offices, the  
counters will be behind secure screens.  
# 2.4 Foreign currency outlets  
Chapter 34 \(Retail shops and stores\) and Chapter 39 \(Transport  
terminals and interchanges\) make reference to individual retail  
components that are likely to be included with retail complexes.  
Payment counters within larger retail or transport facilities will  
include foreign exchange outlets. These are essentially secure  
screened cashier counters, designed in a similar way to those within  
banks. Figure 30.6 illustrates a typical layout.  
# 2.5 Ticket desks  
Travel centres such as rail and bus stations, which provide book-  
ing services and issue tickets, also require a similar kind of secure  
counter to those within banks. Matters concerning circulation, tick-  
eting and retail are described in Chapter 39 \(Transport terminals  
and interchanges\), but the design of the counter component is cov-  
ered in Section 3.3.  
# 2.6 Government services outlets  
Local authority council and other government or public offices  
which incorporate payment and counselling facilities include\:  
Council Tax payment offices, local authority housing rent offices,  
DWP Jobcentre Plus offices, DVLA offices, HM Revenue &  
Customs offices, Regional Passport Offices and Citizens Advice  
Bureau offices. These buildings require a number of functions  
similar to those found within banks such as open-plan or enclosed  
customer interview rooms and payment counters. Design aspects of  
those elements are described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.  
# 2.7 DWP Jobcentre Plus offices  
As a type of government service outlet, the Jobcentre Plus, which  
is the Department of Work and Pensions’ principal service for  
job-seekers, has been transformed in recent years to provide a  
more twenty-first-century high quality experience for users with  
modern, customer-focused services and facilities. Although its new  
system asks individuals to initially call a Jobcentre Plus call centre  
to register personal details, customers are then asked to attend an  
interview at their local Jobcentre Plus outlet. Its main function and  
attraction is its interactive computer system which can be accessed  
**30.5** *Post office layout with a sorting office and a parcel-collect facility* **Payment and counselling offices** **30-5**  
**30.6** *Typical foreign currency outlet layout*  
by customers using touch-screen computer terminals, together with  
the more customer-friendly interview room facilities and services.  
Figure 30.7 illustrates the zoning plan for a Jobcentre Plus office;  
Figure 30.8 illustrates a typical layout. In addition to accessible job-  
seeker terminals, the main customer reception area has a waiting  
area for interview services. This type of facility has a long history  
of having the potential for attracting aggressive customers, but with  
improvements in benefit distribution systems and jobseeker cus-  
tomer care, the Jobcentre Plus building is frequented by genuine  
customers making use of an essential service. However, security of  
staff and premises, customer privacy and discretion, and quality of  
service are still all key aspects of design for this building type.  
grouped together either on an external wall, on an internal wall in  
the main banking hall, or within a separate 24-hour lobby acces-  
sible from the street which has been a common element in city  
centre banks. The latter is described later, but the current trend in  
retail banking now is to omit any 24-hour lobby as this reduces  
the security risks and maintenance costs associated with late-night  
open lobbies.  
ATMs require to be serviced from the rear for filling with cash  
or for maintenance via a secure room accessible either from within  
the bank’s interior secure zone or from a lockable door. The latter  
is the case for all general ATMs located in retail or public areas.  
Level access is required to ATMs for people in wheelchairs, and  
where more than one ATM is provided at least one will be at a  
lower accessible level.  
# 3 KEY COMPONENTS  
# 3.1 Automatic Teller Machines \(ATMs\)  
ATMs are a universal item on the high street, not only being a sta-  
ple component within the exterior shopfront and interior of banks  
and building societies, but also being widely available within other  
public zones such as retail areas, entertainment complexes and  
transport terminals. Figure 30.9 shows the setting out requirements  
for an ATM. Within banks, it will be usual for several ATMs to be  
# 3.2 24 hour lobbies  
A typical arrangement for 24-hour lobbies for ATMs provided by  
banks is shown in Figure 31.10. These will be directly accessible  
from the street, open during the day and accessible out of hours using  
a bank card. Although building societies are becoming more like  
banks, it is unlikely that they will follow the banking trend of recent  
years to provide 24-hour lobbies for ATMs due to the obvious risks. **30-6** **Payment and counselling offices**  
# 3.3 Counters  
Figures 30.11 and 30.12 illustrate traditional forms of secure  
screened counters; Figure 30.13 shows an example of an open bank  
cashier desk for use in current retail banking. Payment counters,  
which require secure screening for safety and security purposes,  
will be fitted with bulletproof glass. Microphone and speaker sys-  
tems allow for communication through enclosed glass screens, and  
a pass-through slot or tray is provided at counter level. For people in  
wheelchairs, at least one counter will be at a lower accessible level.  
Where there is little fear of firearms risk, but where the possibility  
still exists for physical assault, that is, in many government services  
outlets, counters can be designed to be higher or deeper than normal,  
making it difficult for the customer to reach over to the staff behind.  
# 3.4 Interview and counselling spaces  
The majority of these building types provide customer interview  
facilities. These range from simple desks in open public areas, to  
open-plan interview spaces directly off a public space, to fully  
enclosed interview rooms. Banks and building societies tend to  
provide all three versions; post offices tend not to include any,  
apart from main city centre offices which are able to provide addi-  
tional staff to advise on financial products; government services  
outlets usually require enclosed interview rooms, where there is  
commonly a need for privacy and customer sensitivity. All arrange-  
ments contain the same basic requirement of a desk or table with  
staff and customer seating, and these are illustrated in Figure 30.14.  
# 3.5 Fixtures and fittings  
Fittings in these buildings will be bespoke items provided by  
furniture manufacture specialists to corporate brand designs and  
specifications. Furniture design will therefore not usually be within  
the scope of the architect’s work, and so this chapter does not  
cover the detailed content and functional requirements of fixtures  
and fittings. The organisations who procure these buildings will  
have their own design manuals of standard designs or proprietary  
specifications for fittings and equipment. However, there are key  
components such as counters and public accessibility issues which  
are required to comply with relevant legislation, and which there-  
fore require careful dimensional location considerations.

# 4 PROCUREMENT  
Gone are the days when an architect will be commissioned  
by a bank to design a bank branch. Banking corporations will  
each have their own in-house property divisions who will have  
**30.8** *A Jobcentre Plus office* **Payment and counselling offices** **30-7**  
**30.9** *ATM setting out*  
separately commissioned brand design manuals for branch con-  
cept designs and details, for use by architects and designers to  
be applied to any design project involving the fitting out of an  
existing bank interior as a refurbishment or the fitting out of a new  
build retail unit. The brand concept manual will comprise stand-  
ard bank branch layouts to suit differing locations, and detailed  
designs for all necessary interior components down to signage  
and items of furniture and office equipment\: all designed by oth-  
ers as a menu of components to be applied by specific project  
designers.  
Design teams are likely to be appointed by specialist fit-out  
contractors who will be appointed through a design and build  
framework to project manage the design and construction works for  
the procurement of a number of projects; for that purpose a specific  
design manual brief will be supplied. Architects’ and designers’  
scope of work will therefore be to apply the standard designs to  
a specific site and obtain the necessary statutory approvals for its  
execution. Similarly, building societies, post offices and special-  
ist outlets such as foreign exchange counters will be procured to  
specialist fit-out contractors who will employ design consultants to  
apply standard designs to specific sites.  
For government services outlets, design and construction  
projects will be procured through official government contract pro-  
curement. Local authority and government departments will, via  
such public procurement methods, either appoint single consultants  
or contractors to individual projects, or through framework agree-  
ments appoint a number of suppliers of design and/or construction  
services to procure a variety of larger and wider strategic projects  
within any specific geographical local authority area or national  
project scope. **30-8** **Payment and counselling offices**

spaces, which are not significantly different from social spaces in  
secular buildings, and for which Chapter 17 \(Community centres\)  
provides further advice. However, it should be borne in mind that  
for some faith groups, the provision of a social space is a core part  
of their values and in some cases will be fully integrated within that  
part of the building designated for religious observances.  
Religious bodies, as charities, are regulated in ways that do not  
apply to most other clients, \(and there is also variation on charity  
law between different parts of the United Kingdom\). As a result, at  
local level the officers of religious bodies may be unaware of the  
legal implications of their charitable status.  
This may have implications for their professional advisers, who  
should take care to ascertain the scope and extent of the authority of  
trustees at, or prior, to accepting an appointment. Typically, the trustee  
role of officers of religious organisations may constrain their ability to  
enter into contracts, to purchase or dispose of land and/or buildings,  
and to make payments. As a result, final authority for certain deci-  
sions may be reserved for their regional or national authorities.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Scope  
This chapter covers churches and places of worship for various  
Christian denominations, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras and  
Hindu temples. Local places of worship only are dealt with, not  
larger buildings like cathedrals, or \(in general\) separate social  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-34  
# 1.2 History and tradition  
In the architecture of places of worship for the more established  
Christian denominations and for some other faith groups, the architect  
is bound to be more concerned with tradition than in other fields. Users  
are more conscious of history \(and more sensitive about it\) than most  
other clients\: they will not allow an architect to ignore established  
precedents and will expect a full understanding of them. Many places  
of worship are listed buildings. The majority of these are Anglican  
churches, but other long-established denominations also have signifi-  
cant numbers of listed premises and, in some cases, church buildings  
no longer required by their original denomination have been sold to  
another denomination and re-purposed for their style of worship.  
Many of the new ‘Community Churches’ expect to see a differ-  
ent approach more akin to performance architecture than established  
precedents. These new movements have also had a major impact  
upon the more established denominations, and have resulted in  
a movement away from one-person ministry to more participa-  
tion by members of the congregation. Large, free-span structures  
are required to accommodate large congregation numbers, seating  
capacities of 500–1000 are not uncommon, for which the conversion  
of redundant retail warehousing and similar structures are ideal.  
Exact details of the forms of worship and building procedures  
should be discussed with the individual clients, and the architec-  
tural implications thoroughly understood.  
# 1.3 Local Ecumenical Projects \(LEPs\)  
Many churches are now uniting to form LEPs, both as a visible  
expression of church unity and in recognition of declining numbers  
and reducing resources. In these, the uniting congregations may  
continue to worship separately at different times in shared prem-  
ises; this would be typical, for example, of LEPs incorporating a  
**31-1** **31-2 Places of worship**  
Roman Catholic congregation. Alternatively, they may unite to  
form a single congregation recognising the practices of each of  
the participating denominations; this would be typical of congre-  
gations from within the same tradition or related traditions. The  
building may be either that belonging to one of the congregations,  
or purpose built \(less often\), possibly on a site previously occupied  
by one of the participating denominations.  
Such projects are set up \(in England and Wales\) under the Sharing  
of Church Buildings Act 1969, which imposes some legal require-  
ments for LEPs in addition to the expectations of the participating  
denominations. This may be relevant to designers, as the investment  
of capital in buildings is one of the areas dealt within the Act. For  
every LEP, there will be \(or should be\) a formal ‘Sharing Agreement’,  
which sets out terms of the Agreement, and is intended in particu-  
lar to safeguard the traditions and assets of both \(or all\) the uniting  
congregations, and the premises, which are commonly \(though not  
universally\) vested in one of the participating denominations, *not* in  
the local congregation. Architects involved in LEPs should take time  
and care in understanding the legal constraints entailed by the Act and  
the Sharing Agreement, and should be aware that officers and leaders  
of the local congregation are unlikely to be *au fait* with these details.  
# Part A Guide to Christian Denominations  
# 2 OVERVIEW  
# 2.1 Range  
The history of the Christian churches in the UK is complex, and  
closely interlinked with the political history of the British Isles. In  
2017, there were approximately 50173 congregations in the UK,  
of which about 42000 used church premises, demonstrating that  
churches can, and do, operate without buildings. These congrega-  
tions were divided into around 250 Christian denominations in the  
UK. Of these, 10 broad groupings of churches can be identified\:  
**Anglican\:** Including Church of England, Church of Ireland \(in  
NI\), Church in Wales, Scottish Episcopal Church  
**Baptist\:** Including Baptist Union of Great Britain, Independent  
Baptist churches, Baptist Union of Wales, Baptist Union of  
Scotland, Grace Baptist Churches, the Association of Baptist  
Churches in Ireland \(NI\), Gospel Standard Strict Baptists.  
**Roman Catholic\:** Roman Catholic Church in England and  
Wales, Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, Roman Catholic  
Church in Scotland  
**Independent churches\:** Including Christian Brethren \(Open\),  
Fellowship of independent Evangelical Churches, Union of  
Welsh Independents, Christian Brethren \(Exclusive\), other  
Congregational Churches, Churches of Christ  
**Methodist\:** Including Methodist Church of Great Britain,  
Methodist Church in Ireland, Wesleyan Reform Union,  
Independent Methodists and Free Methodists  
**New Churches\:** Fluid category of independent churches, some  
of them members of wider groupings and networks  
**Orthodox\:** Including Greek Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox,  
Russian Orthodox, other Eastern Orthodox Churches, oriental  
Orthodox Churches and other Orthodox Churches  
**Pentecostal\:** Including Redeemed Christian Church of God,  
Elim Pentecostal Churches, Assemblies of God, several churches  
of African and West Indian origin and a significant number of  
smaller denominations and independent churches  
**Presbyterian Churches\:** Including Church of Scotland,  
Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland, the United Reformed  
Church, Presbyterian Church of Wales, Free Presbyterian  
Church of Ulster, Free Church of Scotland and other smaller  
Presbyterian denominations  
**Other denominations\:** Including the Salvation Army, Seventh-  
Day Adventists, Lutheran Church, the Religious Society of  
Friends \(Quakers\), Church of the Nazarene, Moravian churches,  
Mennonites, the Unitarian and Free Christian churches.  
# 2.2 Control of church premises  
Works to existing churches and places of worship are likely to be  
constrained by at least some of the following;  
• Procedures of the denomination in question  
• Extent to which control of premises is devolved to the local con-  
gregation  
• Age of the building \(and especially whether it is a listed building\)  
• Whether the building was originally for designed for the current  
or some other denomination, or for some other purpose entirely.  
In addition, the architect may encounter among church office-hold-  
ers the mistaken conviction that various aspects of planning and  
building control legislation do not apply to places of worship. This  
is rarely, if ever, correct, though it may have been the case in the  
past. However, certain denominations do have the specific right  
to determine listed building applications themselves. These are\:  
Church of England; Church in Wales; Roman Catholic Church;  
Methodist Church; Baptist Union of Great Britain, Baptist Union  
of Wales and United Reformed Church. This power is *not* devolved  
to the congregation and the architect may find that the relevant  
body in the denomination can be more demanding than the local  
planning authorities in considering listed building applications.  
# 3 ANGLICAN  
# 3.1 The buildings, and how they are used for worship  
After the Reformation, the Anglicans inherited many mediaeval,  
mostly Gothic, buildings, strongly directional in their east–west ori-  
entation and with the main action remote from the congregation.  
The people therefore had lost the sense that they were engaged with  
the clergy in a common action and tended to become spectators with  
an individualistic rather than a corporate response to the liturgy. The  
Church has now moved into a period of experiment with a fuller  
expression of the corporate nature of worship, and the equal impor-  
tance of the Word \(which must be heard\) and of sacrament, within  
a building which remains true to the Anglican sense of proportion.  
# 3.2 Altar \(or table\), priest and people  
The influences of the Reformation, and later the Oxford Movement,  
have produced variations to the layout of the sanctuary. The Book of  
Common Prayer \(BCP 1662\) assumes the table, or altar, to be against  
the east wall with the priest standing at the north end, Figure 31.1.  
In many churches this has been superseded by the priest facing  
east, Figure 31.2.  
**31.1** *Communion table is placed against east wall, priest stands*  
*at north end* **Places of worship 31-3**  
# 3.4 Church design  
Apart from the altar, the general principles of layout and design  
are the same as for the Roman Catholic and Methodist churches.  
These are described in Sections 4, 5 and 7. These sections also  
give appropriate space requirements for aisle widths, pew sizes and  
areas within the sanctuary.  
**31.2** *Eastward position\: priest faces altar with his back to the*  
*congregation*  
This was thought to be contrary to the spirit of the Anglican liturgy.  
Altars were moved west with the priest facing the people across the  
altar, Figure 31.3.  
More recently, there are churches which bring the people even  
closer to the celebration by positioning the altar in the centre of a  
square or circular building, with seating on three sides. Figure 31.4  
shows the plan of the church of St Paul at Bow Common in London  
\(1960, Architect\: Robert Maguire and Keith Murray\).  
# 3.3 Main services  
There are several types of service\:  
• All age services  
• The Eucharist  
• The offices of matins and evensong  
• Baptism  
• Confirmation  
• The solemnisation of matrimony  
• Burial of the dead.  
# 3.5 Alterations and extensions to existing churches  
Although some new churches are being built, the majority of  
works are for the provision of community facilities, meeting  
rooms, toilets and kitchens. In listed buildings, any propos-  
als are judged with great scrutiny by the Diocesan Advisory  
Committee \(DAC\) and English Heritage. Proposals that are  
reversible and do not encroach on the existing structure tend  
to be favoured.  
At the Church of St Andrew in Farnham, Figure 31.5, advan-  
tage is taken of the large floor space to create a glass and timber  
two storey pavilion structure at the west end of the nave and the  
two aisles taking no support from the existing fabric. The pavilion  
encloses meeting rooms and a kitchen with a viewing and meeting  
gallery over. The altar is in a centre position with seating on all  
four sides.  
A different approach was taken at the refurbished Church of All  
Saints Flore, Figures 31.6 and 31.7. In this mediaeval church with a  
Georgian flat ceiling, the walls are plain with cornice and panelled  
dado. The two aisles flank the west tower. The full width of the  
west end is separated from the aisles by full height walls, and the  
mediaeval tower arch was glazed to create a meeting space, toilet,  
kitchen and vestry.  
**31.3** *One of the many variations of plan where the priest faces*  
*the congregation across the altar. The seating may extend around*  
*three sides of the altar*  
**31.4** *Church of St Paul at Bow Common, with seating on three*  
*sides of the altar*  
**31.5** *Plan of the Church of St Andrew, Farnham \(Architect\:*  
*Ptolemy Dean Architects\)* **31-4 Places of worship**  
• Either the DAC or the Chancellor may refer the proposals to an  
appropriate conservation body such as English Heritage whose  
observations may or may not be accepted by the DAC or the  
Chancellor.  
# 4 ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH  
# 4.1 Worship as a corporate act  
The term ‘Roman Catholic’ \(or to members simply ‘Catholic’\)  
denotes the Christian community which has continuously accepted  
the authority of the Pope. The chief problem of a community which  
is building a Catholic church is that, though its building must suit  
the liturgy as it now is, community and architect must also make  
some estimate of what the total ultimate change in form of services  
is likely to be.  
The corporate nature of Catholic worship is again now being  
stressed. Catholic churchgoing has for centuries been highly indi-  
vidualistic. The congregation should participate in the liturgical  
action and not merely watch it. Baptism is being restored as the  
corporate act of the local assembly, but it is still conducted as a  
private ceremony held at a time to suit the parents and which only  
they and their friends attend. The architect must make corporate  
baptism possible in a church, even though it may not be practised  
for some time.  
The existence of societies within the parish is always impor-  
tant in its social life and the architect should find out which they  
are, what they do, and whether they are to be accommodated in  
any way.

**31.7** *Church of All Saints Flore, plan after conversion \(Architect\:*  
*Stimpson Walton Bond\)*  
# 4.2 The main services  
The six main services of the Catholic Church are\:  
• Mass  
• Easter liturgy \(Holy Week ceremonies\)  
• Baptism  
• Marriage  
• Burial of the dead  
• Devotions.  
Other liturgical activities include blessing, dedication, conse-  
cration, confirmation, ordination.  
# 4.3 Church design  
Apart from the altar, the general principles of layout and design  
are the same as for the Church of England. These are shown, with  
separate altar details, in Part B.  
# 3.6 Obtaining a faculty  
There are several considerations to bear in mind when securing a  
faculty for church building work\:  
• New, extensions and repair works are subject to faculty, an  
approvals procedure dating back several centuries.  
• This was consolidated in 1993 by the *Care of Churches and*  
*Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure Code of Practice* granting  
exemption from listed building consent for work to Grade I and  
II\* listed church buildings.  
• The Measure is administered in each diocese by a DAC.  
• The process is often initiated by a site visit with the Parochial  
Church Council and the architect followed by preliminary and  
detailed submissions to the DAC.  
• If there are no objections, the DAC informs the Parish and the  
Chancellor of the diocese to whom the Parish submits a formal  
request for a Faculty. The Chancellor is a judge or a QC.  
• Exemption is only from listed building consent. External alter-  
ations may be subject to planning approval from the local  
planning authority.  
# 5 FREE, NON-CONFORMIST AND PRESBYTERIAN  
# CHURCHES  
# 5.1 Origins and buildings  
During the Reformation, one of the leaders, John Knox, became  
greatly influenced by the Swiss John Calvin and it was basically  
his system of church government and structure, as well as much  
of his theology, which he brought into the church. This system of  
church government by courts, basically government by the mem-  
bers of the church congregation, is known as ‘Presbyterian’, as  
opposed to ‘Episcopalian’ which is government by an appointed  
hierarchy.  
Other reformers came to similar conclusions by slightly dif-  
ferent historic routes; most such denominations operate with  
various arrangements for self-government at local, regional  
and national levels. Most \(but not all\) such denominations  
have agreed Statements of Faith, and formal Constitutions set-  
ting out what decisions are to be made at which level within  
the denomination’s structures. The governing body of each congregation is responsible for day-to-day organisation and  
management of the affairs of the congregation and are usually  
the charity trustees.  
There may be denomination-wide or local variations from what  
is stated here. The architect should therefore always ascertain the  
actual situation, taking into account any information or guidance  
published by the denomination\(s\) involved.  
This is particularly important when dealing with LEPs, as there  
are likely to be differing opinions within the congregation and the  
local leadership, and a building project may well bring such differ-  
ences to the fore.  
# Places of worship 31-5  
for the whole service or may take part of the service from a prayer  
desk or a lectern, or from behind the communion table, using the  
pulpit \(if any\) only for preaching. The minister may move from  
the pulpit to the communion table to receive the offering, and will  
certainly do so to administer communion. The font and/or baptistry  
will of course be used for administering baptism, and the front of  
the sanctuary steps \(if any\) for admission of new communicants or  
for ordination of elders.  
In more recent buildings, or in the course of modernisation or  
re-ordering, a raised sanctuary floor would be avoided because of  
the difficulty this presents for disabled persons, and also because  
there is no theological justification for it.  
A pulpit might not be required – the introduction of sound sys-  
tems reduce the need for the pulpit which was historically an aid  
to audibility.  
Pews are rarely now installed. Where they exist, they are fre-  
quently removed as an obstacle to multi-purpose use and/or to  
experimental forms of worship and/or to congregational partic-  
ipation generally. They can also be extremely uncomfortable.  
However, their removal can nevertheless be contentious, and in a  
listed building may become a major issue in determining an appli-  
cation. Movable seating may be left in position or stored when not  
in use to allow other uses of the space.  
# 5.3 Ways of worship  
The Reformation established the doctrine of ‘the priesthood of  
all believers’\: it was not necessary for any human being to come  
between God and a worshipper, and the only mediator accepted  
was Jesus Christ. There is therefore no good theological reason for  
a chancel in its literal sense of a ‘railed-off area’ in ‘Free’, Non-  
conformist and Presbyterian churches. In practice, many such  
churches do have a sanctuary or chancel area which is therefore  
now simply where the central act takes place.  
All take part in the full worship and sacramental act. There is  
now a fairly general departure from the earlier rectangular form of  
church in favour of a more open form where the sense of gathering  
the people round the Word and sacrament, as represented by the  
pulpit and communion table, can be expressed.  
Present thinking seeks to emphasise the close links between  
the worship room and the rooms for secular purposes, so that  
there may not be a complete divorce between the weekday and  
Sunday activities of the congregation. The economic circum-  
stances of the congregation may well lead to multi-purpose  
buildings where only a portion is kept entirely for worship,  
while the rest is used for other purposes, with the use of par-  
titions and screens. Sometimes, no area is exclusively reserved  
for worship.  
# 5.4 The main services  
There is a wide variety of practices within the ‘Free’, Non-  
conformist and Presbyterian Churches and local congregations can  
adopt their own practices. The types of services normally held \(but  
subject to both denominational and local variations\) are\:  
• Public worship on Sundays \(morning, evening or both\)  
• As above, with addition of Holy Communion  
• As above with the addition of Baptism \(usually of infants using a  
font but in the case of LEPs which include a denomination which  
practices adult Baptism, a baptistry as described in Section 8  
below may also be required\)  
• As above, with ordination of elders/deacons or admission of new  
communicants/church members  
• Marriages \(in England and Wales only if the building is regis-  
tered for marriages\), and/or the blessing of civil marriages and  
civil partnerships; note that marriage law in Scotland differs  
from that in England and Wales and does not require registration  
of the building  
• Funerals – although in many cases the service will be held at the  
cemetery or crematorium  
• Weekday services – apart from Christmas Eve, Christmas Day,  
Maundy Thursday and Good Friday services – are relatively  
uncommon; where held they may be joint services with other  
local congregations of different religious traditions.  
# 5.5 Minister  
The ordinary conduct of worship is left largely to the minister \(or  
in some denominations to any authorised lay person\). In a more tra-  
ditional building, they may choose to remain in the pulpit \(if any\)  
# 5.6 Church design  
While there is great variety in the way services are conducted,  
much of the speaking is done by the minister. The congregation sit  
for prayers and do not kneel in the pews or at their seats. The pews  
or seating may be seen as an extension of the communion table,  
so the congregation is, in effect, sitting around the table. Where  
seating is movable, the communion table may sometimes be set in  
the centre of the space with the congregational seating surrounding  
the table.  
Depending on the denomination, worshippers remain in their  
seats throughout the services, with the elements of communion  
being passed around by the elders/deacons; or may come to the  
front of the church/the sanctuary to receive communion.  
Baptism must take place in the face of the congregation and the  
font or baptistry should therefore be visible to all. The font should  
be in advance of, and \(if fixed\) probably to one side of, the com-  
munion table and at a slightly lower level. It can be movable but in  
some traditions may have a permanent site in the sanctuary. It need  
*not* be at the entrance to the church \(as was traditional in Anglican  
churches\).  
Where pews are to be used, a central aisle is desirable for  
marriage ceremonies. However, in any new installation, the  
requirements for evacuation in an emergency would take prec-  
edence and in a large capacity building might require additional  
aisles.  
The choir \(if any\) should be visible to the congregation but need  
not be in the sanctuary.  
The communion table is a table and not an altar. It is usually  
rectangular but other shapes are not precluded. Basic sizes are  
given in Section 11.  
A large or fixed lectern is not essential but where provided it  
should be to the sizes shown in Section 12, taking account of the  
comments in Section 12.1  
If a pulpit is required, it may be centrally in front or to one side  
of the table or, more rarely, behind the table. It should not be more  
elevated than is required for the congregation to see the preacher.  
General design is as shown in Section 12; see also the comments  
in Section 12.5.  
A chair for the minister is provided centrally behind the com-  
munion table with often at least one additional chair on each side  
for elders/deacons. Alternatively, seats for elders/deacons may be  
provided against the rear wall of the sanctuary/the rear wall of the  
church. **31-6 Places of worship**  
# 6 THE SALVATION ARMY  
# 6.1 Origins  
The Salvation Army arose from evangelical meetings conducted in  
east London during 1865 by the Reverend William Booth, a min-  
ister of the Methodist New Connection. Booth decided to take the  
church to the people. His services were held in the open air, in tents  
and in theatres\: later he built barracks and citadels in which his con-  
verts could hold their meetings. His services were sensational\: he  
used brass bands playing secular tunes to accompany hymns; con-  
verts \(soldiers\) wore uniform. He became a ‘general’ and directed  
the organisation in quasi-military style. Men and women had equal  
rights in office. Booth regarded social work, care of the poor and  
rehabilitation of the outcast as an essential part of his Christian  
mission.  
The Christian mission, as it was first called, grew beyond all  
expectations and in 1878 became known as the Salvation Army.  
In its belief, it is protestant, evangelical and prophetic. The corps  
assembles for worship in a hall – a multi-purpose building some-  
times called a citadel, temple or barracks. Sometimes within the  
complex there are two halls, for senior and junior soldiers respec-  
tively. Religious services and social activities may be conducted in  
either or both halls.  
# 6.2 Ceremonies  
Ceremonies may be divided into two types\:  
• Ordinary services held on Sunday – morning, afternoon and  
evening  
• Ceremonies applicable to marriages, funerals, memorial services,  
covenants, swearing-in of soldiers and presentation of colours  
\(these may be embodied within one of the ordinary meetings\).  
The architectural implications are shown in Figures 31.8 to 31.13.  
**31.9** *Praise meeting or festival*  
**31.10** *Swearing-in ceremony*  
**31.11** *Wedding*  
**31.12** *Funeral*  
**31.8** *Salvation Army\: possible basic arrangements. Note that*  
*access from officers’ room to platform may be on either a side or*  
*rear wall*  
**31.13** *Presentation of colours* **6.3 Design of the assembly hall**  
There will be no communion service and visually there will be no  
elevation or placing of the sacred elements in a part of the build-  
ing. The font, lectern, pulpit, communion table and altar are not  
essential to the Salvation Army form of worship. In every Salvation  
Army hall there is a place for the mercy seat, Figure 31.14. This is  
a simple wooden form, usually placed at the front of the platform  
in front of the congregation, and is a place where Christian and  
non-Christian penitents may kneel at any time.  
**31.14** *Mercy seat*  
*Platform*  
The platform will be required to accommodate, at various times,  
officers taking a leading part in the services; the band \(possibly a  
visiting one which may be larger than that designed for\); the song-  
ster brigade or a visiting choir.  
The size of the platform will depend on local conditions and  
requirements but approximately 0.5 to 0.6 m2 per person \(seated  
in rows\) should be allowed. The platform should not be less than  
about 4–5 m depth, but will normally be more. Its height above the  
hall floor should not normally be less than 760 mm or more than  
1100 mm but sightlines must be considered in relation to a level  
floor both on the platform and in the hall.  
If there is a gallery, there must be a view of the mercy seat from  
every seat. Movable seats, not fixed pews, are always used both on  
the platform and in the hall\: flexibility is important.  
*Hall*  
As a first estimate for the overall area of the hall, allow 0.56 m2 for  
each person to be accommodated. Aisles should not be less than  
1.35 m wide. The space between the front edge of the mercy seat  
and the front face of the congregational seating should not be less  
than 1.5 m. A wide rectangle, polygon or square will be a more  
satisfactory shape than a long narrow rectangle.  
The requirements will be for a reasonable standard of acoustics  
for speech, choral singing and brass band playing. There should be  
a reasonable level of natural lighting and a reasonable standard of  
artificial illumination, both on the platform and in the body of the  
hall. The ventilation in most cases should be natural.  
*Officers’ room*  
The officers’ room \(vestry\) is used as a meeting-place by leaders  
or chairmen of meetings and officers of the Census Board who will  
assemble in the room before taking their place on the platform. The  
room should accommodate between two and ten persons. Corps  
records will be kept in this room. Lavatory accommodation will be  
required, normally one unit for each sex.  
*Cloakrooms*  
Lavatory accommodation should be provided for both sexes near  
or adjacent to the entrance vestibules of the senior or junior halls.  
# Places of worship 31-7  
This will be required for women in the songster room and for men  
in the band room.  
*Storage*  
Storage will be required in a band room for brass band instruments,  
music stands and music. The room will also be used for assem-  
bly, briefing and cloakroom. Minimum area shown will usually be  
23–28 m2. Instruments are stored in individual lockers to suit sizes  
of instruments with a small store for reserve instruments and cup-  
board with shelves for music.  
Storage will be required in a songster room for a wind-type  
portable organ or electric portable organ with amplifier, and  
music. The room will also be used for assembly, briefing and  
cloakroom for the women members who would number about  
20 to 30 in an average-sized brigade\: 18.5 m2 would be a min-  
imum area.  
Where there are junior and senior corps activities, there may  
be a junior band and singing company \(junior choir\). Storage will  
be required for brass band instruments for this junior band and for  
music for the singing company.  
Where there is a separate junior hall, storage compartments will  
be contained in that hall. Other social and club activities may also  
require storage.  
# 7 METHODIST CHURCH  
# 7.1 Origins  
The Methodist Church grew out of the Church of England dur-  
ing the eighteenth century and was founded by John and Charles  
Wesley. A distinct feature of the new movement was the intro-  
duction of lay preachers or, as they came to be known, local  
preachers. The strong emphasis on evangelical preaching is  
rooted in the Methodist tradition\: ‘Methodism is nothing if it is  
not evangelical’.  
The church or chapel is normally reserved for worship alone,  
although meetings, lectures and musical recitals of a specifically  
religious character may also take place there. A multi-purpose hall,  
with a sanctuary that can be screened or curtained off, may also be  
used for public worship during the early stages of the development  
of a local congregation. There may be other units within the com-  
plex such as classrooms, club rooms and assembly halls, both for  
religious and secular purposes.  
# 7.2 Ceremonies and buildings  
Many of the comments made under the ‘Free’, Non-conformist  
and Presbyterian Churches will apply. The kind of church required  
today will seat between 100 and 300 people. The influence of the  
liturgical movement is shown in certain specific ways, and particu-  
larly in a new emphasis on the place of the sacraments in the life  
of the church, and in the increasing use of set prayers and liturgical  
forms of service. The altar, therefore, is seen again as the Lord’s  
table, used for the family. The font is no longer viewed as making  
possible a semi-magical act. It is the place at which and the means  
by which the person baptised, whether child or adult, is sacramen-  
tally incorporated into the body of Christ. This rediscovery of the  
laity, the Lord’s table and the font has to be considered in designing  
a church, for in the end it is the function of the church which is of  
supreme importance.  
These theological rediscoveries will affect the building of a  
Methodist church\:  
• In relation to the shape of the church  
• In the arrangement of the sanctuary  
• In the siting of the choir.  
There are normally two services on Sunday, one in the morn-  
ing and one in the evening. These are conducted by a minister or **31-8 Places of worship**  
local preacher from the pulpit, though the earlier part of the service  
may be conducted from a lectern, the pulpit being used only for  
the sermon.  
Holy Communion is normally celebrated once a month. In  
order to emphasise the theological statement that the minis-  
try of the Word is of equal importance to the ministry of the  
Sacrament, pulpit and communion table may be placed close to  
each other. The minister dispenses the bread and the wine \(the  
latter in small individual glasses\) to each of those who have  
come forward from the congregation to kneel at the communion  
rail. A small trough or perforated shelf should be fitted to the  
inside of the communion rail, about 50 mm or 65 mm deep and  
slightly lower than the top of the rail, where communicants may  
place the empty wine glasses. See also Section 10, for dimen-  
sions of communion rails.  
All other main services are similar to Church of England prac-  
tice and the architectural requirements are the same, although a  
credence table is not required near the communion table  
# 8 BAPTIST CHURCH AND BAPTISTRIES  
# 8.1 Introduction  
There are two major differences between this denomination and  
most other long-established denominations. The less visible dis-  
tinction is that there is no binding or universal Statement of Faith;  
every congregation is in principle free to determine its beliefs based  
on its understanding of the Bible, though there may be constraints  
on this freedom set out in the trust deeds of the church.  
The more visible difference is the practice of deferring baptism  
to an age at which the person is able to make his or her own deci-  
sion to be baptised, typically 13 or older with no upper age limit.  
This practice \(referred to as ‘Believer’s Baptism’\) is shared by  
other churches such as some of the United Reformed Church and  
many independent churches, but in Baptist churches infant baptism  
is never offered, whereas other denominations will usually offer  
infant or adult baptism as alternatives.  
LEPs which involve a Baptist congregation will normally offer  
both infant and adult baptism – if the premises in question were not  
originally built for Baptist worship they may seek to introduce a  
baptistry, or accept other arrangements which could include a port-  
able pool \(see what follows\) – or hiring the local swimming baths  
for a service including adult baptism.  
The adult, known as ‘candidate’, is baptised by total immersion  
in public ceremony in the context of a service of worship. This  
requires the church to have a baptistry appropriate for such use,  
Figure 31.15, unless they are prepared to accept one of the alterna-  
tives mentioned.  
**31.15** *Baptistry pool for adult baptism as used in Baptist*  
*Churches, LEPs incorporating Baptist congregations and some*  
*others\: a\) section, b\) plan*  
# 8.2 Baptismal ceremony  
The minister will enter the baptistry first, followed by the candi-  
date. If more than one candidate is to be baptised they will be dealt  
with one at a time. The minister may speak briefly, and the can-  
didate may also make a personal statement \(or may have done so  
earlier in the service\). It follows that that minister and candidate  
should be visible while standing in the baptistry, ideally at least  
from the shoulders up. If only the head is visible, the effect can  
become somewhat incongruous. The candidate turns to face the  
steps \(unless there are steps at both ends of the baptistry\) for the  
practical reason that they will be unable to see clearly when leav-  
ing the baptistry, due to water in their eyes. The minister faces the  
congregation.  
The minister then supports the candidate by the shoulders, pro-  
nounces a blessing, lowers the candidate backwards into the water,  
submerging them completely and immediately raises them again.  
The candidate leaves the baptistry, usually supported or guided  
by the minister and/or other assistants, to ensure they do not trip  
or slip.  
On occasions, and particularly if either the minister is small  
in stature or the candidate is large in stature, the minister may be  
assisted by another member of the congregation. Exceptionally, if  
the candidate is infirm, they may kneel.  
In recent years, concerns have emerged about the large water  
usage entailed in baptism by immersion; in new installations the  
possibility of subsequent reuse of water from the baptistry in a  
greywater system should be investigated with the church officers.  
In church buildings without a built-in baptistry \(for example  
where a building has been re-purposed\) the cost or the structural  
implications may prevent the installation of a fixed baptistry. In  
such cases, temporary mobile pools have been used successfully,  
both inside and outside the building. In either case, recycling water  
as greywater should be considered. If used internally, the capacity  
of any suspended floor to sustain the loads imposed by a mobile  
pool should be checked by a structural engineer.  
# 8.3 Key dimensions  
• *Width*, absolute minimum 1300 mm, but this is known from  
experience to be inadequate when an assistant is present, and  
1500 mm to 1600 mm is better. The steps need not be the full  
width of the baptistry  
• *Length*, about 3300 mm, determined by the tallest likely candi-  
date \(95th percentile\) plus space to move and clearance at the  
‘head’ end of the baptistry  
• *Depth* \(surrounding floor level to floor of baptistry\), 1200 mm  
or a little less, determined by the shoulder height of minister and  
candidates \(5th percentile\)  
• *Steps*, suggested rise going and step profile to Part ‘M’ of the  
Building Regulations  
Figure 31.15 shows a rectangular plan, but other arrangements  
meeting the functional requirements are acceptable. The views of  
the local congregation should be sought.  
# 8.4 Other functional requirements  
• *The baptistry* may be located either on a dais or in the body of the  
church; it is normally covered by a removable floor when not in  
use. In either case, sightlines should be considered. If in the body  
of the church, consideration should be given to temporary edge  
protection when open to avoid accidents.  
• *The removable floor sections* should be as light and manoeu-  
vrable as practicable. These will normally have to be moved  
by one or two of the congregation who may well be elderly or  
un-athletic, and the design of the floor sections should allow  
for this.  
• *Floor surfaces*. The baptistry base and the steps should have a  
non-slip finish. Adjacent floor surfaces may need protection. • *Water supply* needs to be available to fill the baptistry in a rea-  
sonable time \(less than one hour\), and drainage is needed to  
empty it in about half an hour. The floor of the baptistry should  
fall gently towards the outlet.  
• *The drainage system* should not be embedded or inaccessi-  
ble. With infrequent use, water traps on the drainage line will  
tend to dry out. Any leak in the drainage system or the bap-  
tistry will be discovered at the most inconvenient moment.  
Suppliers should be asked to confirm that their specifications  
allow for long-term dry conditions with occasional use filled.  
The design life of the complete baptistry installation should  
equal the design life of the building without any significant  
maintenance.  
• *Water heating*. It is normal to temper the water temperature; the  
water need not be warm, but should not make the candidates gasp  
on entry! It is probably inefficient to design the main heating  
and hot water system to supply such a large volume of slightly  
warmed water. Portable electric immersion heaters have been  
used, but all fittings will need to be to an appropriate Ingress  
Protection rating.  
• *Changing spaces* are required for candidates and minister, sep-  
arate for opposite sexes, and possibly for the minister. They  
should be close to the room containing the baptistry, and are  
normally in multi-purpose rooms, but consideration should be  
given to privacy.  
# 9 RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS  
# 9.1 Origins  
The Religious Society of Friends \(Quakers\) originated through  
the experiences and preaching of George Fox \(1624–1691\). Early  
Quakers reacted strongly against the current religious practices and  
liturgy of the established church. All through their history, Quakers  
have been concerned with a sense of duty to the community.  
Because Friends believe that God can communicate with  
humans directly, they do not partake of the outward sacraments.  
They have no separated priesthood, they do not require their mem-  
bers to subscribe to a creed, and their worship does not make use  
of a liturgy. They are, however, in broad agreement with the main  
emphases of Christian belief, and would claim to be both orthodox  
and evangelical.  
# 9.2 Ceremonies and buildings  
In a meeting for worship, Friends gather in silence as a congrega-  
tion of seeking souls, and ‘wait upon the Spirit’. No one directs the  
worship. Out of the ‘gathered’ silence of united worship, one or  
another may be led to engage in vocal ministry or in prayer or to  
read from the scriptures. There is no music or hymn singing.  
The building must be designed to help the quiet worship and  
the vocal ministry of the participants. There is no observance of  
the Lord’s supper or orthodox communion service; no baptism or  
initiation ceremonies involving ritual. There will therefore be no  
need for font, lectern, pulpit or altar.  
Sizes of meeting halls vary, but they will mostly be designed to  
accommodate 50 Friends or fewer. A square, rectangular or polyg-  
onal room may meet the requirements. It is likely that seating will  
be required in a square or a circle. Meetings may prefer fixed or  
movable, tiered or level seating.  
There is no need for a table in the meeting room, though there  
normally is one to act as a focal point. The position is not usually  
literally at the centre of the room; the seating will be arranged in  
the way felt by the group concerned to be most conducive to a  
good meeting for worship, and the table, if placed anywhere, will  
be fitted in with the general arrangement of the room. Its main use  
is for business meetings.  
When not required for worship, Society of Friends meeting  
halls are often used by other denominations, or for secular purposes  
# Places of worship 31-9  
of an appropriate nature. Other accommodation might include a  
multi-purpose hall, library, small kitchen foyer and cloakrooms and  
a caretaker’s flat.  
# 10 UNITARIAN AND FREE CHRISTIAN CHURCH  
# 10.1 Origins  
The roots of the Unitarian movement lie mainly in the Reformation  
of the sixteenth century. The doctrinal ideas challenged included\:  
• Unity or unipersonality of God \(as opposed to the doctrine of the  
Trinity\) – hence the name ‘Unitarian’  
• Humanity, \(as opposed to the deity\) of Christ  
• Worth of human beings \(as opposed to ideas of original sin,  
inherited guilt and innate depravity\)  
• Universal salvation of all souls \(as opposed to the doctrine that  
most of humanity is predestined to damnation\).  
Congregations may be called churches, meetings, chapels or fel-  
lowships. Congregations may meet in their own buildings, in hired  
premises or in private homes. There are around 170 congregations  
in the UK.  
This denomination is included as an example of the simplest  
type of building programme likely to be encountered among places  
of worship.  
# 10.2 Ceremonies and buildings  
Worship usually takes place on Sundays and may be led by a  
Unitarian minister or layperson.  
The flaming chalice is the internationally-recognised symbol  
of the Unitarian movement. This originally appeared informally  
as a piece of corporate identity, but the lighting of a physical  
chalice is increasingly becoming a feature of communal wor-  
ship in Unitarian congregations, and design of buildings for  
Unitarian worship should make provision for this if desired by  
the congregation.  
Other ceremonies include\:  
• Naming ceremonies for infants \(the terms ‘Baptism’ or  
‘Christening’ are not normally used\)  
• Weddings  
• Funerals  
• Communion – this is at the discretion of the congregation.  
Services may include the singing of hymns.  
Unitarian buildings are appropriately simple in design, reflect-  
ing the absence of a formal liturgy. The local congregation should  
be consulted on all aspects of the design. Emphasis should be given  
to the spoken \(and if appropriate sung\) word, and the participation  
and engagement of the whole congregation.  
The layout should be flexible and much of the building is likely  
to be multi-purpose in use. There may be a lectern, and the flaming  
chalice may require a table or other support. Older existing build-  
ings may include a pulpit but this is unlikely to be required in a  
modern building, or the adaption or re-purposing of an existing  
building. There will be no requirement for a font, baptistry, altar or  
communion table. Depending on the size of the congregation and  
building, some or all of the electronic installations referred to in  
section 15.5 below may be required.  
# Part B Design Data  
This section sets out requirements which apply to one or more of  
the church traditions described previously. The Roman Catholic  
and Anglican Churches have the most prescriptive requirements,  
which should be carefully followed. Similar requirements may  
apply to other denominations, but should be verified with local  
church officers and/or their national representative bodies. **31-10 Places of worship**  
# 11 ALTAR OR COMMUNION TABLE  
# 11.1 Symbolism  
The altar symbolises three things\:  
• The body of Christ  
• The altar of sacrifice  
• The table of the Last Supper.  
The Table in the ‘Free’ and Non-conformist traditions symbolises  
only the table of the Last Supper.  
# 11.2 Canon law  
A Church of England altar may be of wood, stone or other suitable  
material and may be movable. It should be covered with silk or other  
‘decent stuff’ during divine services and with a fair white linen cloth  
at Holy Communion. A Roman Catholic altar must be of natural \(not  
reconstructed\) stone with the top member \(the mensa\) in one piece  
and containing the relics of two canonised martyrs or saints. However,  
this requirement may be fulfilled by a small portable altar, which is in  
effect an altar stone often about 300 mm square \(or less\) and 50 mm  
deep containing a sealed cavity \(the sepulchre\) for the relics. The altar  
may be fixed \(stone cemented to the structure\) or unfixed \(timber with  
inset portable stone altar as described\). Only a fixed altar may be con-  
secrated. Alternatively, relics may be sunk into floor below altar.  
**31.16** *Average size of altars. The exact proportions will depend*  
*on its position, and whether the priest is facing the congregation*  
*or has his back to them. Note that the tabernacle containing the*  
*reserved sacrament is not now normally placed on the altar \(see*  
*Section 14\)*  
# 11.5 Supports and coverings  
Methods of supporting the mensa are shown in Figure 31.18. With  
the altar now normally nearer the congregation, the question of  
clothing the altar may need to be rethought. A traditional Church of  
England altar covering is shown in Figure 31.19.  
# 11.3 Position  
The altar must be related to congregational seating in such a way  
that what is done at it is, and is seen to be, a corporate action of the  
whole assembly. Altars are being brought further forward in the  
sanctuary and with congregations grouped around it, there is less  
need for the altar to stand so high as in the past, especially when the  
priest faces the congregation across the altar.  
# 11.4 Size  
For liturgical reasons, altars can be less long but possibly slightly  
deeper than in the past. Average sizes are shown in Figure 31.16  
and anthropometric data in Figure 31.17.  
# 11.6 Footspace  
The platform or base on which the altar rests must be large  
enough for the number of priests expected to stand around while  
celebrating the Eucharist. It may be raised one or two steps  
above the level of the congregation, but in general, the altar  
should be kept as low as possible to avoid any sense of separa-  
tion between it and the people. Possible dimensions are shown  
in Figure 31.20.  
**31.17** *Critical actions of priest when standing at the altar. The horizontal dotted lines represents the eye level of the average adult*  
*member of the congregation when kneeling. This should preferably not be less than 75 mm above the top of the altar, emphasising*  
*the importance of keeping that low. This represents some sacrifice to the priest, since actions a and b are easier if the top is at the*  
*traditional height of just over 1* *m. a\) kissing the surface of the altar, B\) saying the words of consecration, C\) genuflecting. This position*  
*emphasises the value of recessing the altar supports at least on the priest’s side, to prevent him bumping his knee, d\) reaching forward*  
*when standing upright, illustrating the extent of reach* **Places of worship 31-11**  
**31.18** *Supporting the mensa \(altar top\). Note that Roman Catholic altars should not oversail their supports by more than 150 mm, so*  
*that the bishop can pass his thumb over the joints at the consecration*  
**31.19** *Clothing the altar*  
**31.20** *Space around the altar. Keep altar as low as possible, usual maximum three steps. Position of the altar can also be defined by*  
*use of a canopy, structure, lighting, floor patterns, etc. a\) Section, b\) Plan* **31-12 Places of worship**  
# 11.7 Cross and candles  
The exact requirements must be discussed with the priest. Candles  
and cross should not form a barrier between priest and people.  
Some possibilities for the cross are shown in Figures 31.21 and  
31.22; and for the candles in Figure 31.23.  
# 11.8 Communion table  
A communion table with table lectern as used in Presbyterian  
churches is shown in Figure 31.24.  
# 12 SANCTUARY FURNITURE AND PULPIT  
# 12.1 Lectern  
This should be in or near the sanctuary but sufficiently apart  
from the altar to constitute a separate focus, and conveniently  
sited to be accessible to the congregation to read from, Figure  
31.25\. Occasionally two lecterns may be asked for, one each  
side. The lectern must be in a position where everybody can see  
the reader’s face including those within the sanctuary. It may be  
fixed or movable, and it may also serve as a pulpit. Dimensions  
are shown in Figure 31.26. In the case of denominations which  
recognise the ministry of women, or permit women to read dur-  
ing services, design dimensions for lecterns should take account  
of relevant anthropometric data for females. The lectern should  
be adjustable in height – ideally, capable of lowering to the  
appropriate height for a wheelchair user – and the adjustment  
mechanism should be easily operated. Asking a minister or other  
reader of short stature to stand on a box is *not* acceptable. See  
also Section 15.5 below as regards incorporation of laptops or  
other electronics into lecterns.  
# 12.2 Altar rail  
A rail may be dispensed with in some churches, but most will still  
provide lengths of rail for kneeling to receive communion. It need  
not be continuous, but must be rigid and firm. Minimum dimen-  
sions are given in Figures 31.27 and 31.28.  
**31.21** *The cross behind the altar at a height where it will not be obscured by the priest. Crosses are not usually placed on the altar in ‘facing the people’ churches*  
**31.22** *The cross forward of the altar to one side or suspended*  
*above*  
**31.23** *Arrangement of candles. a\), b\) six candles, C\) two candles only. Candles may also be placed on a step lower than the altar to*  
*reduce height and obstruction to view*  
**31.24** *Communion table with table lectern for use in Presbyterian churches instead of the altars described above* **Places of worship 31-13**  
**31.25** *Minimum dimensions around lectern depending on whether* **31.26** *Minimum requirements for lectern*  
*communion rail or only a communion step is provided*  
**31.27** *Clear space requirements around communion rail*  
# 12.3 Credence table  
This serves as a sort of sideboard for water and wine, but check  
if anything else is to be placed on it \(e.g. offertory money, ser-  
vice books, etc.\) in which case a shelf below the table may be  
needed. It should be to the right of the celebrant within the sanc-  
tuary but not where it might cause a visual obstruction. It could  
be a shelf instead of a freestanding table. Dimensions will vary  
from about 610 × 760 mm to 1200 × 460 mm, with a minimum  
height of 820 mm.  
**31.28** *Dimensions for altar rail \(i.e. outside central zone of*  
*sanctuary\). In a new Roman Catholic church there is unlikely to*  
*be a second step in the sanctuary, and the minimum unobstructed*

*normal for the whole of the sanctuary to be one step above the*  
*nave, but too many steps should be avoided. a\) with stepped floor,*  
*b\) with flat floor*  
# 12.4 Seating for officiants  
These will vary considerably and requirements must be estab-  
lished with the local community. In Roman Catholic churches,  
the ‘president’s seat’ will be on the centre line behind the altar,  
raised up on one or two steps, Figure 31.29. The seat, which is  
used by the priest, must not look like a bishop’s throne and will  
usually not have a back to it. The bishop’s throne is portable,  
and placed in front of the altar whenever he visits the church. In  
Church of England churches, it is often better to have the ceremo-  
nial seat \(which is used by the bishop\) at the side of the sanctuary  
facing the altar.  
Incidental seating should be kept to a minimum. It will be  
needed for additional priests, servers and laypeople on special **31-14 Places of worship**  
occasions. It will usually be in the form of benches at the side of  
the sanctuary.  
Stalls will be needed \(especially in Church of England churches\)  
for priests at matins and evensong at the side of the sanctuary.  
Dimensions are similar to those for congregational seating \(see  
Section 15\) except that as priests are vested they will need more  
room to move in and out. Surface for resting a book should be  
deeper \(say, 300 mm\) and almost horizontal – not sloping – with  
a shelf below.  
**31.29** *Dimensions around the President’s seat*  
# 12.5 Pulpit  
This should be sited outside but close to the sanctuary. No par-  
ticular location is now insisted on apart from functional reasons  
of good sight and sound. Minimum internal area is about 1–2 m2  
.  
Access should desirably be from the side \(if from back, fit a door\).  
Other details are shown in Figure 31.30.  
A ‘Free’ church or Non-conformist pulpit may be behind the  
communion table or at either side. The traditional location of the  
pulpit at high level with its own stepped access was dictated by  
audibility and visibility requirements in a pre-electronic world and  
is to be deprecated on accessibility grounds. See also Section 14.5  
below.  
The reading desk in the pulpit should be adjustable in height  
and the adjustment mechanism should be easily operated. As with  
lecterns, asking a minister of short stature to stand on a box is *not*  
acceptable.  
**31.30** *Pulpit dimensions*  
# 13 FONT  
# 13.1 Description  
In Roman Catholic churches, movable fonts are not permitted and  
they are not generally approved of in the Anglican communion.  
They can, however, be used in Presbyterian and Methodist churches  
and those ‘Free’ and Non-conformist Churches which practise  
infant baptism. In Church of England, ‘Free’ and Non-conformist  
churches, fresh water is used for each baptism. In Roman Catholic  
churches, water is blessed once a year and the baptismal water is  
stored in the font which has two compartments.  
For baptisteries for adult \(’believers’\) baptism see 8.1.  
# 13.2 Dimensions and shape  
Anthropometric requirements are shown in Figure 31.31. Shape is  
governed by the needs of the priest \(space for service book and  
other small objects\), the comfort of the priest in holding the baby,  
and the safety of the baby \(the priest should not have to lean too far  
over\). Where a movable font is permitted, required consideration  
should be given to maximum weight for safe handling. In the case  
of Anglican and other churches which recognise the ministry of  
women and also utilise fixed fonts, design dimensions should take  
account of relevant anthropometric data for females.  
**31.31** *Anthropometric diagram showing the critical action at the*  
*font*  
# 13.3 Position of fixed font  
Various alternative positions are shown in Figure 31.32. The font  
must be approached from the church \(congregation\) side but be  
divided from it in some way \(e.g. by difference in floor or ceiling  
levels, although this would limit access for wheelchair-using clergy  
and/or parents\). It must be in a prominent position and be seen by  
the congregation when seated, or space provided for most of the  
congregation to stand around. It should be a separate focus from the  
altar and therefore possibly not in the sanctuary.  
# 14 RESERVATION OF THE SACRAMENT  
# 14.1 Siting  
The reserved sacrament in Roman Catholic churches \(the con-  
secrated bread of the Eucharist\) is not now normally kept in a  
tabernacle on the altar. It is normally kept  
• In a separate chapel outside the sanctuary  
• In a position which is architecturally important  
• Where its location will be easily recognised by the congregation.  
The requirements are complex and the practice of the local  
church community must be established and agreed with the DAC.  
Figures 31.33 and 31.34 show height limitations.  
The reserved sacrament is occasionally found also in the Church  
of England, but is rarer and many methods of reservation are prac-  
tised. **Places of worship 31-15**

# 15 GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS  
This section is applicable in principle to all Christian denomina-  
tions, but should always be referred to the relevant church officers  
and/or published denominational guidance for confirmation or  
alternative requirements.  
# 15.1 Entrance requirements  
There are several considerations for designing entrances\:  
• Provide wind lobbies outside entrance doors – consider the use  
of power-operated doors to reduce the chance that they will be  
wedged open at times of peak flow, which would negate their  
purpose. These would need to be overridden for funerals or other  
ceremonial processions to prevent premature closure.  
• Minimum clear door width \(for processions and funerals\) should  
be 1.7 m \(1.1 m in a small church\).  
• Minimum clear height \(for processional cross\) should be 2.3 m,  
otherwise 2.05 m is sufficient. **31-16 Places of worship**  
• Minimum clear height for pallbearers \(of up to 95th percentile  
height \(male\)\) bearing 450 mm high coffin and 450 mm high  
floral tribute is 2.4 m.  
• Provide proper access for disabled people \(see Building  
Regulations Part M in England and equivalent regulations in  
other jurisdictions\). Level access \(including ramped access\)  
should always be provided to the principal entrance, and where  
practicable to other entrances as well.  
• Provide secondary exit door, especially for weddings.  
• Provide gathering spaces inside and outside the church as part of  
the normal exit route where people can naturally gather to talk.  
• Where needed \(especially in RC churches\) place a holy water  
stoup \(basin\) on the entrance side of each doorway leading into  
the church. Rims should be 710 to 760 mm above the floor.  
• Provide considerable space for notices of all types in a conspic-  
uous position.  
• Allow space, where required, for one or two small credence  
tables just inside the entrance.  
• Provide facilities for selling of publications, etc.  
• Where possible, provide access from the entrance area to the WC  
and to the sacristy or vestry.  
• As a general rule, try to keep the purely *secular* activities more  
in view when the congregation is *leaving* than when entering for  
a service.  
# 15.2 Arrangement of seating  
The congregation should be continuous with the minister with no  
strong dividing line between them. Equally, the congregation must  
be united with one another and all must have good access to circu-  
lation and, where it exists, to the sanctuary. Seats facing each other  
around an altar should not be closer than about 6 m, and nobody  
should look sideways on to anybody else closer than 1.5 to 3.0 m.  
# 15.3 Spacing and dimensioning of seats  
Anthropometric details are given in Figure 31.35. Note also\:  
• Minimum dimension of seat plus kneeling space front and back  
is 920 mm. Where congregations do not kneel \(e.g. Methodists,  
Presbyterians, many ‘Free’ and Non-conformist denominations\),  
the dimension can be reduced to 760 mm.  
• Leave a space of about 280 mm between front edge of seat and  
back edge of kneeler.  
• Allow minimum width of 510 mm per person.  
• Maximum length of row is 10 persons \(5.1 m\) with access from  
both ends, or six persons \(3.06 m\) with access from one end; this  
may be further conditioned by applicable Building Regulations  
governing means of escape.  
• The ledge for hymn books should be about 150 mm wide \(300  
mm for the choir\); but given the increased use of printed hymn  
sheets or service sheets, and video display of words, hymn books  
may not be required.  
**31.35** *Critical dimensions for seating. Black lines indicate*  
*one particular solution found very satisfactory in practice. The*  
*dotted line indicates ‘eye’ level when sitting, and concerns the*  
*relationship with the altar top*  
# 15.4 Circulation  
Basic dimensions are shown in Figure 31.36. Space must be  
allowed for wheelchairs and walking aids during the service where  
users can participate fully in the service, accompanied by their fam-  
ily and/or carers without blocking circulation. This is, of course, far  
easier to accomplish with unfixed seating.  
**31.36** *Aisle widths. Size and pattern will depend on overall plan and liturgical considerations. Seating may be fan shaped or in blocks*  
*around the sanctuary* **15.5 Sound and video systems**  
Most churches now use systems of sound amplification of speech,  
singing and instrumental music. The use of wireless microphones  
and lapel microphones have liberated ministers and other worship  
leaders from being tied to the lectern and pulpit, and can also assist  
in congregational participation, where this is desired. Induction  
loop systems for hearing aid users can be transformative for those  
who rely on them. The traditional locations of lectern and pulpit  
were determined largely by audibility and visibility requirements,  
and the changed circumstances are now affecting their design and  
location to the extent that there is some question whether they are  
needed at all. This can greatly increase the flexibility available, par-  
ticularly where the worship function shares a multi-use space.  
In addition to sound reinforcement, the use of video technology  
is now also being applied in places of worship. This includes\:  
• Playing video clips published, or pre-recorded, for the specific  
service  
• Displaying words of hymns, \(possibly in lieu of hymn books or  
printed service sheets\) readings and responses etc.  
• Notes to reinforce the spoken content of sermons and addresses  
• In larger auditoria, providing an enlarged view of the speaker  
and other participants  
• Relaying proceedings to other rooms in the premises  
• Relaying the service to members of the congregation unable to  
visit the church premises as a result of illness or disability, either  
as a recording or ‘live’ via the internet.  
The design and planning of new or altered church premises should  
provide for sound amplification and induction loop systems, and –  
if required – video installations from the outset, which have signifi-  
cant implications for natural and artificial lighting design.  
However, with the introduction of these technologies, the sight  
of a hapless member of the congregation struggling to master a  
professional sound mixing desk has become a common embarrass-  
ment. Professional advice should be sought, and the requirements  
discussed with church officers. In smaller premises at least, the  
use of a public-address amplifier without a mixing desk may be  
perfectly adequate. The specification for an induction loop system  
should always include the equipment \(usually a receiver and head-  
phones\) necessary for a non-hearing impaired person to test that the  
induction loop is actually working.  
The design of lecterns may be required to accommodate laptop  
computers and connections or other management systems to con-  
trol sound and video systems.  
# Places of worship 31-17  
priest from the congregation and makes sharing of toilet facilities  
difficult. The vestry could be near the entrance \(but ensure secu-  
rity\) so that priest and procession go through the congregation to  
their place in the sanctuary. Since children often participate in adult  
worship for only part of its duration, movement between the main  
worship space and ancillary rooms should be considered.  
There should be a lobby with double doors between the choir  
vestry and the worship room, and a space out of sight of the con-  
gregation for processions to form up. A door direct to the outside  
is essential as priests and choir should not have to go through the  
worship room to reach their vestries.  
# 16.3 Detailed design  
There is a very wide range of objects and vestments to be stored  
and the precise requirements must be ascertained. A vestment  
storage cupboard is shown in Figure 31.37. Doorways should be  
1700 mm wide × 2300 mm high.  
**31.37** *Section through vestment cupboard*

# 16 VESTRIES AND SACRISTIES  
# 16.1 Accommodation  
Accommodation requirements will vary considerably. The most  
lavish could include\:  
• Priest’s sacristy \(sometimes called priest’s vestry\)  
• Server’s vestry  
• Choir vestry and practice/committee room  
• Women’s choir vestry  
• Churchwardens’/interview room  
• Cleaners’ room sometimes placed together  
• Flower arrangers’ room and called working sacristy  
• Priest’s WC  
• Men’s and women’s WCs  
• General storage  
• Small kitchen.  
# 17 CONFESSIONAL  
# 17.1 Design requirements  
Priest and penitent must be able to hear what each other has to  
say without being overheard by others. The bishop’s require-  
ments must be established, and the psychological expectations  
of the parish.  
Either priest and penitent may be enclosed in an acoustically  
isolated box or, more desirably, they may be visible but placed far  
enough away from other people to make a physical acoustic barrier  
unnecessary. Basic dimensions are shown in Figure 31.38.  
# 16.2 Planning relationships  
The tradition of the vestry/sacristy complex opening directly onto  
the sanctuary has disadvantages\: it emphasises the separation of  
# 18 ORGAN AND CHOIR  
# 18.1 Music in church  
Use of music in worship can be a highly emotive subject. While  
traditional choirs still exist and flourish in many situations, these  
have been supplemented to varying degrees with less traditional  
styles of music, and the introduction of instrumental music of  
all kinds. **31-18 Places of worship**  
**31.38** *Anthropometric study of confessional*  
# 18.2 Organs  
Historically, the type of organ and the placing of the choir have  
been two of the most difficult musical problems to solve for  
churches. For new churches, organs based on the ‘werk prinzip’  
\(sometimes called ‘neo-classic’\) should be considered rather than  
the more traditional Victorian organs with high wind pressures and  
powerful but muffled tone. The organ builder should be brought in  
at an early stage of the discussions.  
However, these days the cost of a new pipe organ installa-  
tion is likely to be prohibitive, although second hand ones can  
be an option. Digital organs are available at far lower prices, and  
as they are relatively undemanding in their positioning, little or  
no provision is required for their installation on the part of the  
architect.  
**31.40** *Bad position of choir and people, key as for 31.39*  
# 18.3 Relationship of musical elements  
A few basic principles must be observed\:  
• The player must be with his or her instrument, that is, the organ  
console must not be distant from the pipes, Figure 31.39  
• The choir should not be distant to the organ, Figure 31.40  
• Ministers should not be separated from either people or organ,  
Figure 31.41  
• People should not be placed between the choir and ranks of  
pipes, Figures 31.40 and 31.41  
• The organ must be in the main volume of the building and raised  
above the floor so that the pipes are above the heads of the lis-  
teners.  
Different possible locations of choir, organ and congregation are  
shown in Figure 31.42.

**31.39** *Bad organ arrangement. Key\: o\) organ, c\) organ console,*  
*p\) people, ch\) choir, m\) minister, a\) altar*  
# 18.4 Other instrumentalists and vocalists  
In some churches across a wide range of denominations, music  
will be performed by, or led by, a group of instrumentalists with  
or without vocal and instrumental soloists. Where this is the  
case, a wide dais is likely to be required, equipped with power  
outlets for electrical instruments and provision for multiple  
microphones with a remote mixing desk. Provision for stage  
lighting rigs and possibly sophisticated video displays may also  
be required, all with appropriate power supplies and audio, video  
and data cabling.  
On occasion, these facilities will need to be introduced into  
an older or re-purposed building in a sympathetic and unob-  
trusive manner. Early consultation with the client is essential,  
even if fitting out is to be undertaken by specialists separately  
from construction work, to allow for sufficient power supplies  
and unobtrusive routing of cables and any necessary equipment  
cabinets. **Places of worship 31-19**

# 19 SYNAGOGUES  
# 19.1 History  
The original churches evolved from the synagogues set up to  
supplement and eventually to supplant the Holy Temple in  
Jerusalem. It is therefore not surprising that they have many ele-  
ments in common.  
There are two main strands of Judaism\: orthodox and progres-  
sive. As far as the design of the synagogue is concerned the only  
difference between them is that in the orthodox tradition men and  
women are rigidly segregated, and women take no direct part in  
the service.  
# 19.2 The sanctuary  
*Holy Ark*  
The principal architectural feature of the synagogue is the *Aron*  
*Kodesh* or Holy Ark, Figure 31.43, which contains the Scrolls of  
the Law. These scrolls, Figure 31.44, are hand written on a very  
long strip of parchment, and are the first five books of the Old  
Testament, called the *Torah*. Each end of the parchment is fixed to  
a stave, and the parchment is rolled around the staves. Because the  
portion to be read is not immediately accessible, as in a conven-  
tional book, it is usual to have several scrolls in the Ark, so that the  
correct place does not have to be found during the service.  
Scrolls, when not being read from, are bound, covered with  
a mantle and usually adorned with a silver shield, a pointer and  
*rimonim*. The latter are detachable silver finials, often decorated  
with small bells, for the top ends of the staves on which the parch-  
ment is rolled. The Ark itself is raised and approached up steps  
from the floor of the synagogue. It should preferably, but not nec-  
essarily, be on the eastern wall of the synagogue. It has both doors  
and a curtain. It should be able to accommodate at least four scrolls,  
and may well be large enough for many more. It needs internal  
lighting, *not* operated by a door switch.  
Traditionally the Ark is decorated with particular Hebrew texts,  
by representations of the Tablets of the Ten Commandments, and  
often by heraldic beasts.  
**31.43** *Holy Ark. a\) Elevation, inscription means ‘Know before*  
*whom you stand’, b\) Section*  
**31.44** *Torah scroll. a\) Elevation, b\) Plan. C\) Scroll when open,*  
*on reading desk or when elevated* **31-20 Places of worship**  
*Bima*  
The service is conducted from a reading desk raised above the floor  
of the synagogue. Traditionally this should be in the centre of the  
space, as in the plan of a synagogue in Figure 31.45; but some  
synagogues have been designed with the Bima integrated with the  
Holy Ark, Figure 31.46. There is a custom that the Bima should be  
three steps above the floor.  
The Bima contains a reading desk large enough to hold an  
open scroll, with at least five people around three sides of it. The  
Bima should also be able to accommodate two people holding  
unused scrolls, with sufficient space for dressing them \(separately\).  
Facilities are provided for scroll vestments to be kept while that  
scroll is being read, including pairs of ‘spikes’ for the rimonim.  
*Pulpit*  
A pulpit is provided for the minister or rabbi from which to deliver  
a sermon. It is usually placed on the longitudinal axis of the syna-  
gogue immediately in front of the Holy Ark, and is not raised above  
the Ark’s level. It does not have a door.  
*Congregational seating*  
The congregational seating surrounds the Bima. Since services can  
be very long \(on *Yom Kippur* they take the whole day\), the seats  
have to be comfortable. It is common for them to have lockable  
boxes beneath, as on the Sabbath, orthodox people do not carry  
their prayer books, prayer shawls, and so forth. In larger syna-  
gogues, the seating is banked to enable a good view for all.  
The reading of the scroll is followed by the congregation from  
Hebrew bibles which are quite large. Each seat, therefore, needs a  
bookrest, Figure 31.47. However, some prayers have to be said facing  
the Holy Ark; this means turning sideways in many seats. It is normal  
for the bookrests to be hinged to increase the clearance. Prayers are  
said either standing or sitting. Congregants *never* kneel in a synagogue.  
Most larger synagogues have galleries and in orthodox syna-  
gogues the women sit here. Since the use of a lift is forbidden on  
the Sabbath and Holydays, they are not usually provided in ortho-  
dox synagogues. Women unable to climb stairs are accommodated  
in a section of the downstairs behind a curtain \(*mechitsah*\).  
**31.45** *Plan of synagogue with central Bima. This would seat*  
*396 men downstairs, 7 women downstairs and 275 women in the*  
*gallery*  
**31.46** *Plan of synagogue with Bima before the Holy Ark, seating*

*and benches are moved aside to accommodate the canopy on the*

**31.47** *Seat and bookrest. A\) Section. The bookrest folds up to*  
*make more clearance. The seat lifts to reveal a locker for prayer*  
*book, bible and prayer shawl. B\) Plan*  
*Processions*  
These are a feature of synagogue services. At services where read-  
ings are given from the Torah, the scroll or scrolls are taken from  
the Holy Ark and processed to the Bima before the reading, and  
processed back afterwards. On the Feast of Tabernacles most of  
the men will process behind the scrolls carrying palm branches and  
citrons. On the Rejoicing of the Law, all the scrolls that the congre-  
gation owns will be processed around the synagogue many times.  
The aisles must be wide enough for these processions. *Other features*  
• A *Ner Tamid*, eternal light, hangs before the Holy Ark.  
• The rabbi or minister has a box normally placed to one side of  
the Ark, with a seat facing the congregation.  
• The chazan, or cantor, has a matching box on the other side of  
the Ark.  
• The wardens have a box usually placed just forward of the Bima  
facing the Ark. It should have room for four wardens.  
• Where there is a choir it may be accommodated in a normal seat-  
ing area, or in a special place such as above the Holy Ark.  
• Storage near the entrance should be provided for prayer books,  
bibles and prayer shawls  
• A display board similar to a hymn board is provided for service  
details.  
• Progressive congregations need an organ. Some Orthodox syna-  
gogues have a limited musical facility for weddings.  
• For weddings, a *chupah* \(canopy\) is erected on the Bima if there  
is room, or forward of it on the floor of the synagogue. The cou-  
ple and the rabbi are accommodated under the chupah, with as  
many others of the family and witnesses as there is room for.  
• Funerals only take place in synagogues on rare, very special occa-  
sions. A special prayer hall, Figure 31.48, is provided at Jewish  
cemeteries. This is a covered open space with a few benches  
around the walls for infirm people. The floor is at ground level\:  
the coffin is not carried by bearers but pushed on a wheeled cart.  
There are doors at both ends to signify the progress of man from  
birth to death. A small detached building on one side with open  
windows is provided for *cohanim* who are not permitted to enter  
any building containing a corpse.  
• Purification using water, analogous to Christian baptism, takes  
place by total immersion not in a synagogue but in a separate  
facility called a *mikvah*. The design of this can be similar to a  
hydrotherapy pool. Such purification is not for infants, but is  
used by the orthodox at adult conversions, on certain occasions  
by women and by some men on a weekly basis.  
**31.48** *Plan of cemetery prayer hall*  
# 19.3 Building services  
*Lighting*  
Lighting levels should be high as many services take place after  
dark. It is traditional for all available sources to be used even in day-  
light. Some may be symbolic, such as a *menorah* near the Holy Ark.  
*Heating*  
As services can be long, an efficient heating system is essential.  
Commonly this comprises hot water radiators; radiant sources such  
as used in churches are not popular.  
# Places of worship 31-21  
*Ventilation*  
This must be efficient, as on occasion the synagogue will be  
packed. Control should preferably be automatic. It should not pro-  
duce draughts or noise.  
*Speech reinforcement*  
This may be required in progressive synagogues, but is not permit-  
ted by the orthodox on Sabbaths and Holydays. However, nearly all  
synagogues are now allowed to use ‘loop’ systems for deaf people,  
and this will require microphones to be placed very discreetly on  
the Bima, pulpit and the Holy Ark controlled automatically.  
Large Orthodox synagogues need to be carefully designed for  
excellent acoustics in view of the lack of any reinforcement system.  
Even so, this implies a maximum capacity of about 1500.  
# 19.4 Outside the sanctuary  
Since services are long, synagogues need adequate cloakroom and  
lavatory accommodation. A vestry for the rabbi and chazan is often  
provided at the Ark end of the building with a direct entrance into  
the sanctuary close to the rabbi’s box.  
There is a foyer between the street entrance and the sanctuary,  
and there are stairs from this to the ladies’ gallery. The foyer should  
have notice boards to publicise the many activities in conjunction  
with the congregation. There may also be one or more built-in char-  
ity boxes \(used only on weekdays\). Immediately outside there will  
be a board giving the times of services and so forth.  
Most synagogues have additional halls, classrooms for religion  
school, kitchens and so forth. Orthodox synagogues provide no  
car parking, as driving on the Sabbath and Holydays is forbidden.  
However, a very few parking spaces may be provided where land  
is available for the minister and for weekday use.  
# 19.5 Holydays  
The High Holydays occur around September, and congregations  
are much larger than on a normal Sabbath. Some buildings are  
designed to open up hall and classroom areas to the main sanctuary  
at this time; alternatively, one or more additional services are pro-  
vided in detached halls. As Orthodox synagogues use no electrical  
speech reinforcement, additional services are separately conducted.  
This usually involves using a mobile Holy Ark with the reading  
desk on the floors of the hall used; thus, special provision in the  
building design for these occasions need not be made.  
# 20 MOSQUES  
# 20.1 Elements  
Muslims do not need a special place to pray – praying can and does  
take place in the street. Where a purpose-built mosque is provided,  
it should comprise and conform to particular rules.  
Every mosque has four basic elements, Figure 31.49. These  
are the *mihrab, Bab Al-Sadir*, dome and minaret. Both the dome  
and minaret have a symbolic rather than a utilitarian function in  
contemporary mosque design. \(Terms in *italics* are listed in the  
Glossary section 20.10.\)  
**31.49** *Main features of a mosque. Key\: A\) fountain, B\) worship*  
*hall, C\) mihrab, D\) qibla wall, E\) entrances, F\) minaret* **31-22 Places of worship**  
# 20.2 The mihrab  
The *mihrab*, Figure 31.50, is indispensable, as it indicates the direc-  
tion to holy city of the Kaaba in Makkah \(Mecca\), Saudi Arabia.  
The direction to Kaaba is also known as *qibla*. In symbolic terms,  
it is the most important element of the modern mosque.  
It is essential that this direction is accurately established.  
Generally, in the UK, it is in a south-easterly direction, with a bear-  
ing of approximately 118° degrees from the north. The *mihrab* is  
centrally located along the south-east wall, so that there is an equal  
distance to the left and right of the wall.  
The *mihrab* is where the Imam leads the congregation for prayer  
and may also house the *minbar*, Figure 31.51, a pulpit from which  
the *Imam* will address the congregation, particularly on a Friday. The  
*minbar* might be a low platform, or be at the head of a flight of stairs.  
**31.50** *Mihrab*  
Traditionally the minaret has an internal staircase leading up  
to the uppermost balcony, but these days it usually only carries a  
speaker system so that the Muezzin stays at ground level.  
# 20.6 Prayers  
The prayers, which are conducted in silence, are said standing,  
kneeling and prostrate in rows parallel to each other behind the  
Imam \(the person who leads the prayer\). There are therefore no  
seats, but the prayer hall is carpeted and the carpet may be marked  
with imprinted prayer mats pointing to *qibla*. Allow at least 1.0 m2  
per person for praying.  
No shoes are allowed past the main entrance, and there are places  
to leave them, usually in racks, to one or both sides of the entrance.  
# 20.7 Other essentials  
Other essentials to be provided are the *wuzu*, *wudu* or ablution area,  
the *janaza ghusal* or morgue, and *kutub khana* or library.  
# 20.8 Ablution and toilets area  
The ablution area, Figure 31.52, is where the faithful wash their  
hands, elbows, faces, behind the ears and their feet in preparation  
for praying, and for entering any other part of the mosque, unless  
they have done so in advance. This is performed under running  
water. The ablution area also houses the toilets and showers. The  
number of ablution seats, toilets and showers is governed by the  
size of the prayer hall.  
Ideally, the toilet area should be next to the ablution area, that  
is, access to the toilets should be after entering the ablution area  
and not the other way around. The ratio of the WC cubicles to the  
ablution seats is 1\:3, so for every three ablutions seats, there should  
be at least one WC cubicle.  
The WC cubicles are generally a combination of Asian and  
Western WC cubicles and the ratio of the Asian to the Western  
cubicle is 1\:5, that is, for every five Western cubicles, only one  
Asian WC could be provided, although this is not essential.  
**31.51** *Minbar*  
# 20.3 Bab Al-Sadir  
Bab Al-Sadir is the grand entrance. In Arabic, ‘Bab’ means a gate  
or door and Al-Sadir means the frontal. Traditionally it symbolises  
the importance of the mosque in the street scene and life of the city.  
# 20.4 The dome  
The dome is generally centrally located over the main prayer hall  
and there may be more than one dome to a mosque. It is first and  
foremost a landmark, indicating the importance of the mosque to the  
life of the community. In addition, it has two practical functions\: to  
echo the words of the Imam inside the mosque and to cool the hot air  
when it rises upwards and draws in cooler air from outside. Modern  
technology now compensates for the above two functions.  
# 20.5 The minaret  
The minaret is used to call the faithful to prayer. It is usually in the  
form of a circular, octagonal or square tower which projects above  
the mosque with at least one balcony along its length. It is possible  
to provide more than one minaret in a mosque and more than one  
balcony for each minaret.  
**31.52** *Plan and section of ablution area* **20.9 Design**  
The design must conform to particular principles and detail rules.  
These include\:  
The four elements of mihrab, Bab Al-Sadir, dome and minaret  
must be designed in proportion to each other. Figure 34.53 shows  
plans of the two levels of a typical mosque.  
• The congregation must be able see the Imam.  
• No one is permitted to pray in front of the Imam.  
• No one should enter the prayer hall near the front of the prayer  
hall.  
• No one should pray towards any areas containing the toilets and  
ablutions.  
• A prayer hall cannot be located above ablution and toilets area.  
# Places of worship 31-23  
• Male and family entrance/exit, prayer hall and ablution must be  
separate.  
• Toilets cubicles should be constructed in solid masonry and not  
thin partitions.  
• Their orientation is of paramount importance. Cubicles must not  
face or back onto the direction of Makkah \(Mecca\).  
• Both Asian and Western type toilets must have a douche type  
hand-set *shattaf*\) as well as a water tap.  
• The drain is required to be provided in each Western type cubicle.  
• Liner drains to be provided in the ablution area.  
• No other habitable enclosure or space should be behind the  
*mihrab* within the confines of the site.  
• Toilets may not be situated under or over the prayer hall, and no  
drainage pipes whatsoever should pass over it.

# 21.3 The mandapa  
This is the central hall where the worshippers assemble. They  
approach the garbagriha through the *antarala* which steps up.  
Prayers are said here, seated upon the floor. A portable fire  
altar is brought into the room at the time of worship. Some  
of the worshippers play musical instruments, others assist the  
priest.  
# 21.4 The ardhamandapa  
This is traditionally orientated towards the rising sun and also is  
raised above the ground by steps.  
# 22 SIKH GURDWARA  
# 22.1 Design  
The gurdwara, Figure 31.55, consists of a single large room with  
the takht platform at the end furthest from the entrance. There are  
no special requirements for orientation. On the takht stands the  
*palki*, a canopy over the *Guru Granth Sahib* which is the focal point  
of the gurdwara. The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikh scripture, and  
is kept on the *Manji Sahib*, a low reading desk. The palki is free of  
the wall behind to permit circumambulation.  
# 21 HINDU TEMPLE  
# 21.1 Design  
There are three main sections to a Hindu temple, Figure 31.54\:  
• The *garbagriha* or shrine room  
• The *mandapa* or pillared hall  
• The *ardhamandapa* or porch.  
**31.54** *Hindu temple, longitudinal section and plan*  
# 21.2 The garbagriha  
This contains the object representing the deity, usually a statue. It  
may be covered by a canopy, or the roof of the garbagriha itself  
may be in the form of a pyramid. There should be an ambulatory  
called the *pradakshina* between the statue and the outer wall.  
**31.55** *Sikh Gurdwara. a\) plan. There is no standard shape*  
*but the Guru Granth Sahib must be the focus of attention*  
*always visible from all points of the room. The aisle is left*

*Sahib before sitting in the congregation. Sometimes there are*  
*separate entrances for men and women, b\) elevation of the*  
*takht* **22.2 Services**  
Worshippers enter the gurdwara at random times, go directly to  
the takht and prostrate themselves before the Guru Granth Sahib.  
They leave offerings of money or of kind on the takht in front of  
it. They then sit on the floor, men on one side and women on the  
other, leaving the central aisle for later comers. During the ser-  
vice, verses are read from the Guru Granth Sahib; hymns are sung,  
music is played by the *ragis*, musicians seated on a platform/stage  
adjacent to the Guru Granth Sahib. The distinguishing feature of  
a gurdwara externally is the Sikh flag. A tall flagpole is therefore  
necessary.  
# Part D Additional Information  
# 23 CREMATORIA  
# 23.1 Introduction  
More people are cremated than buried now due mainly to the scar-  
city of land for cemeteries and the consequent high cost of grave  
space. However, some religions such as strict Catholicism and  
orthodox Judaism do not permit cremation.  
In most cases of cremation, a ceremony precedes the disposal.  
This may be religious or it may be a purely secular occasion. After  
the body has been cremated \(which may not be immediately after  
the ceremony\) the ashes may be\:  
• Deposited in a columbarium associated with the crematorium  
• Scattered in a Garden of Remembrance also at the crematorium  
• Taken away for deposition or disposal elsewhere.  
Crematoria may be municipal or commercial. In the former case,  
they are usually situated in or next to a municipal cemetery.  
Columbaria and Gardens of Remembrance can be provided on the  
cemetery land. Private crematoria will also provide these facilities,  
as they can be financially rewarding. The designer must establish a  
clear brief from a client in these respects.  
# 23.2 Siting  
The crematory \(i.e. where the furnaces are housed\) should not be  
sited near existing buildings because the effluent from the flue can  
be unpleasant under certain climatic conditions. The statutory sit-  
uation requires that crematoria may not be sited closer than 183 m  
\(92 m in inner London\) to domestic property. Ideally, crematoria  
should be located in quiet surroundings, with as much natural land-  
scape as possible.  
A minimum site of 1 hectare is required for the crematorium  
buildings themselves. Further space requirements will depend on  
whether a Garden of Remembrance is required, when a further hec-  
tare at least will be necessary, and more if commercial aspects are  
to be developed to the full. These areas include the space needed  
for traffic circulation, parking, a modest amount of room around  
the building, and the crematorium itself.  
Vehicular access to the site should be simple and dignified and  
free from traffic hazards. The entrance should preferably not be  
immediately off a principal traffic route. If this is unavoidable, then  
it should be off a roundabout or where there is space in the central  
reservation of a dual carriageway for the hearse and mourners’ cars  
to wait in a dignified manner.  
# 23.3 On-site circulation  
Clear routes should be provided within the site for vehicular and  
pedestrian traffic, Figure 31.56. Only the hearse, principal mourn-  
ers’ and disabled people’s vehicles should be allowed beyond the  
car parking area. These vehicles should arrive at the building under  
a porte-cochère. The coffin will be transferred to the chapel and  
then the hearse and other vehicles routed to a waiting area, ready  
to pick up the principal mourners after the service. One or two  
# Places of worship 31-25  
parking bays should be provided close to the chapel for disabled  
people. All other mourners should park their cars in a car park away  
from the main building.  
The entrances to and exits from the building should be located  
as far as possible from the furnace room so that mourners are not  
aware of the mechanics of disposal. The pedestrian traffic flow  
should follow that of the coffin into the chapel. Mourners arriv-  
ing at the chapel should not meet mourners leaving the previous  
service. After the service, the people walk from the chapel to a cov-  
ered way, where floral tributes are displayed, through to the chapel  
of remembrance \(if provided\) and then back to the car park via the  
garden.  
**31.56** *Crematorium vehicular flow diagram*  
# 23.4 Chapels  
Chapels should take into account Christian, non-Christian  
and secular usage – perhaps separate chapels for Christian and  
other users; or if the same space is used for all, a system of eas-  
ily changed symbols installed. Where more than one chapel is  
provided, one may be small \(20 seats\) and the other larger \(110  
seats\). Organs are installed in older crematoria, but the cost of  
services of an organist will be charged as an ‘extra’. Most crema-  
toria now have systems for the digital download and playback of  
almost any musical work.  
The chapel should be designed to reduce emotional disturbance  
caused by the proceedings, Figure 31.57. The event can be ‘sof-  
tened’ in a number of ways. For example, windows can be provided  
at a number of levels to enable the mourners to look through the  
chapel into a restful and attractive external landscape; the designer  
should avoid a totally introspective environment. Again, the cata-  
falque can be offset from a central position so that the mourners  
tend to concentrate on the minister conducting the service and not  
solely on the presence of the coffin.  
**31.57** *Chapel arrangement* **31-26 Places of worship**  
# 23.5 Toilets  
Many people become emotionally disturbed either before or during  
the service. The toilets should be easily accessible before the ser-  
vice, immediately after the service and at the point where relatives  
disperse after the ceremony. At least three groups of toilet facilities  
are required.  
# 23.7 The furnace room  
The finishes in the furnace room should be impervious and easily  
maintained. Blow-back on ignition may occur occasionally, and  
soot deposits can accumulate on walls and ceiling.  
# 23.8 Ancillary accommodation  
All or some of the following will be required depending on cir-  
cumstances\:  
# 23.6 Coffin circulation  
A diagram of the coffin circulation is given in Figure 31.58.  
• Administrative suite  
• Manager’s office  
• Waiting rooms  
• Resting place with catafalque  
• Vestry for clergy  
• Flower room  
• Transfer chamber and coffin storage  
• Viewing room  
• Furnace operator’s room and storage  
• Attendant’s room  
• Public toilets  
• Gardener’s store and porter’s lodge.

markedly with the huge increase in use of video or telephone con-  
sultations, which is likely to continue after the pandemic. Looking  
ahead, the government has undertaken to re-examine the relation-  
ship between primary care and care homes for the elderly, which  
may in time impact on design requirements.  
# 1.3 Policy review  
At the time of writing, the Department of Health was reviewing the  
Health Building Note 11–01\: Facilities for primary and community  
care services. This will embrace issues highlighted and accelerated  
by the pandemic, such as the links between physical and mental  
well-being, and the interlink between health policies with lifestyle  
social policy, housing standards, education and economic success.  
# 1.4 Changing briefs  
The combination of Covid-19 and recent health policy changes  
means that architects working in this area are faced with significant  
shifts in briefing documents for primary health care buildings. Key  
organisations involved in driving and implementing these policies  
are set out in Section 2.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Health  
The definition of health, agreed by the World Health Organization  
at its foundation in 1948, is that ‘Health is a state of complete phys-  
ical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of  
disease or infinity’ \(Lord Crisp, Health is Made at Home; Hospitals  
are for Repairs\).  
This definition sets out a strong case that ‘Health is made at  
home and at school, in the community, the workplace and wider  
society’.  
Today, primary health care is very much at the forefront of  
setting and delivering the health service. It is increasingly rec-  
ognised that the health of individuals is intimately linked to the  
health of communities. Creating health therefore grows out of the  
home, the workplace, the school, the community and wider society.  
Architects have a key role in designing primary health care facilities  
that reflect local and regional cultures, and provide environments  
that allow General Practitioners \(GPs\) to deliver a comprehensive  
health service that embraces this wider social cohesion.  
# 1.2 Covid-19  
The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 caused a sea change in NHS  
thinking and expenditure, and has transformed the approach to the  
provision of health care facilities in the UK. Emergency Nightingale  
hospitals were designed, built and commissioned in weeks – a pro-  
cess which previously could have taken a decade. Similarly, there  
have been seismic changes in the working practices of GPs, most

# 2 BACKGROUND  
# 2.1 National Health Service  
Primary care is the front door of the NHS. It includes not only general  
practice but community pharmacy, dental and optometry \(eye health\)  
services, and accounts for some 75 per cent of the NHS budget.  
The NAPC \(National Association of Primary Care\) defines  
effective primary care as\:  
• A person’s first point of contact with the health and social care  
system  
• A person-centred \(holistic\) approach, rather than disease  
focused, to continuous lifetime care  
• A comprehensive set of services, delivered by multi-professional  
teams, with a focus on population health needs  
• The coordination and integration of care in partnership with  
patients and providers.  
# 2.2 General practitioners  
The Royal College of General Practitioners \(RCGP\) is the mem-  
bership body for more than 50000 GPs. GP practices are contracted  
by the NHS to deliver primary care services to patients.  
A voluntary extension to the contract, known as a directed  
enhanced service \(DES\) was developed that would be offered to  
general practices coming together as primary care networks \(PCNs\)  
covering populations of around 30000 to 50000 people. These net-  
works also work together with community, mental health, social  
care, pharmacy, hospital and voluntary services in their local areas.  
These build on the core of current primary care services and enable  
greater provision of proactive, personalised, coordinated and more  
integrated health and social care.  
The RCGP envisages significant change in the next decade,  
as set out in its vision document *Fit for the Future – a vision for*  
**32-1** **32-2 Primary health care**  
*general practice*, 2020, which found that 80 per cent of GPs felt  
their premises were not fit for the future. Instead, the GP estate  
requires a significant upgrade – through modernising existing  
premises or moving purpose-built surgeries – to enable the expan-  
sion of practice teams and co-location of a wider range of clinical  
well-being services in primary care.  
Primary care will provide more than just clinical treatment.  
Rather than providing an initial assessment process from which  
patients are referred on to secondary and tertiary care regimes, GPs  
will operate a ‘hub’ model with integrated community care.  
GP surgeries will host a wider range of prevention, well-being  
and social action projects and services to tackle health inequali-  
ties and build strong, resilient communities. They will deliver  
more preventative and anticipatory care to support patients to live  
as healthily as possible and to stay out of hospital. Clusters of  
practices will serve as well-being hubs which will aim to address  
patients’ broader psychosocial needs.  
# 2.3 The National Association of Primary Care  
The NAPC developed the model for the Primary Care Home \(PCH\)  
programme, which was launched by NHS England in 2016 and is  
leading the transformation of integrated primary care. There are  
now more than 200 sites serving over nine million people.  
These are a type of primary care network that brings together  
various health and social care professionals working as a team to  
provide enhanced personalised and preventative care for their local  
community. Staff are drawn from GP surgeries, community, men-  
tal health and acute trusts, social care and the voluntary sector, and  
focus on the needs of a local population. The aim is to reduce the  
need for hospital care and long-term residential care.  
The NAPC defines the four key characteristics that make up a  
PCH as\:  
• A combined focus on personalisation of care with improvements  
in population health outcomes  
• An integrated workforce, with a strong focus on partnerships  
spanning primary, secondary and social care  
• Aligned clinical and financial drivers  
• Provision of care to a defined, registered population of between  
30000 and 50000.  
Primary care and social care are natural allies. The key purpose of  
social care is to enable people with a wide range of needs – arising  
from illness, disability and other social circumstances – to live as  
independently as possible. As well as providing care and support,  
social care seeks to protect and safeguard individuals from harm  
and neglect. Social care connects people to a much broader range  
of services from housing to health care.  
GPs and other primary care staff should ideally work closely  
with social workers and other social care staff, especially in care  
homes, nursing homes and home care services.  
# 3 CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS  
# 3.1 Key issues for architects in health care  
Buildings have not played a key role in health policy, but will need  
to in the future. Architects need to find fresh design solutions for  
the many changes that are going to occur in the way GP surgery  
buildings will function over the next decade and beyond.  
The following list sets out a number of key issues to consider\:  
• The patient must come first  
• Emphasis on a high quality of architectural design  
• Recognition of the effect that environmental quality can have on  
health care outcomes  
• Emphasis on the patient as an individual  
• The spatial implications of primary care premises moving to a  
‘hub’ model with integrated community care  
• The need to design flexibly for change, openness, accessibility  
• Architects need to take up the opportunity to build on the new  
interest by doctors to embrace health and humanities  
• Visual stimulus is a key ingredient of the built environment. The  
delight of architecture should not be squeezed out of the built  
environment by analytical methodologies  
• Question the use of standardised primary health care facilities  
such as the same building being reproduced on many sites. While  
some components of a building could be standardised, health  
care needs to accommodate the social values that can flow from  
flexible and humane spaces. There is a high incidence of curved  
shapes in the design of small health buildings. The non-threaten-  
ing building form envelopes the user and is reassuring.  
# 3.2 Changing requirements  
The impact of the pandemic combined with changes in primary  
health care have resulted in many potential implications for the  
design of primary health care facilities. These include\:  
• More consultation rooms  
• Larger, multipurpose spaces for team meetings, consultations,  
specialist clinics, training, workshops and community services  
• Facilitating GPs providing a full triage service  
• Facilitating greater integration of social care  
• Space requirements should be service driven  
• Designs which provide shared spaces rather than defining spaces  
only for a named user  
• More flexible and dynamic use of space to accommodate dif-  
ferent care providers making use of the space at different times  
of day  
• Increased facilitation of consultations digitally as well as face-  
to-face – schedules of accommodation may include as much as  
20 per cent e-consulting rooms  
• No return to standard 10-minute consultations in person  
• Growth of digital technology, phone and video consultation  
could free up space for diagnostics and treatment  
• Business lounge-type environments on site for occasional access  
by office staff working remotely  
• Social distancing may be a design consideration for some time  
to come.  
# 3.4 Impact on patient care and well-being  
There is considerable evidence that the health care environment,  
particularly new and refurbished buildings, improves patient expe-  
rience, outcomes, staff recruitment, retention and morale.  
According to the British Property Federations’ report *Quality*  
*buildings, quality care – How buildings contribute to improved*  
*patient care and staff wellbeing*, investments in new-build health  
care premises in England have had a significant, measurable impact  
on the quality of care provided to patients. New buildings are also  
associated with reducing staff sickness and turnover, patient harm  
\(particularly falls\) and reducing mortality.  
Maggie’s Centres have revolutionised cancer support and rede-  
fined the relationship between architecture and well-being. There  
are 20 centres across England attached to major NHS cancer cen-  
tres where architecture is vital to the care they offer – each warm,  
welcoming and full of light and open space, providing an uplifting  
and calm environment.  
# 3.5 Inclusive design  
One of the core values of the NHS is that everyone should have  
equal access to high-quality health care. Making facilities acces-  
sible for as many people as possible is critical within health care  
environments that are commonly used by people with a wide range  
of motor, sensory and cognitive abilities.  
However, research shows that people with disabilities often  
struggle to access primary care services housed in poorly designed  
buildings that have not been adapted to meet their needs.  
All buildings should ideally be designed to be inclusive for all  
users whether patients, visitors or staff. Design implications may include\:  
• Open plan layouts and floors without stepped access to ease nav-  
igation  
• Building colour zones to simplify orientation and allow users to  
easily give directions  
• Use of feature walls to mark destination points  
• Use of Braille and picture signage to identify rooms.  
See also Chapter 4, Inclusive and accessible design.  
# 3.6 Digital considerations  
More insight is needed into the relationship between primary care  
estates and advances in technology, for example, the need to under-  
stand the implications of online GP services. The Naylor Review  
\(2017\) recommends that it is vital that the future health estate is flex-  
ible and can adapt to the new opportunities that technology brings.  
This includes meeting the growth in demand for group consultations  
and online consultations to improve access. Project sponsors should  
look to design digital needs around current and future delivery models.  
# 3.7 Arts in health  
The importance and influence of art, music, food and architecture  
have all re-emerged as significant factors in designing primary  
health care buildings. Designers should recognise that a sense of  
well-being includes healing the soul as well as mending the body.  
They should discuss with clients, doctors, patients and other users  
of primary care buildings how to incorporate aspects of these ideas  
into the design of new projects. The briefing process for new build-  
ings should focus on the patient and learn from the successes of  
good design developed in the hospice sector.  
# 3.8 Holistic care  
The World Health Organisation has reported that the single most  
important factor for health in a hospital is the atmosphere. If this is  
true, then the spirit in which the medicine is practised is important  
including in the primary care sector, which is the main point of  
public contact with health care. This means\:  
• Providing appropriate spiritual and religious care to patients,  
staff and other users  
• Providing pastoral care  
• Ensuring regular opportunity for religious expression  
• Identifying and assessing the needs for chaplaincy/spiritual care  
• Supporting multi-faith working which respects and supports  
faiths identified  
• Considering the inclusion of spaces for contemplation or rest  
• Considering whether GP surgeries be encouraged to develop for-  
mal links with faith groups in their locality.  
The development of briefing documents for holistic care should be  
a pre-requisite for all new primary health buildings.  
# Primary health care 32-3  
• Capture the sense of change that is sweeping through primary  
health care design.  
Key words and phrases to consider are shown in Table I.  
# Table I Brief writing – key words and phrases

• Government policy • Value for money  
# Issue Architecture Medicine  
An examination of these issues will assist in establishing the stra-  
tegic framework for the design of a new primary health facility. It  
may be helpful to prepare checklists on these points during discus-  
sions with key members of the client and design team. This will  
give focus and direction to the establishment of both the strategic  
and practical aspects of the brief.  
# 4.2 Factors  
Our modern understanding of a primary health centre was set out in  
the Dawson Report \(1920\) as\:  
An institution equipped for services of curative and preventive  
medicine to be conducted by general practitioners of that dis-  
trict, in conjunction with an efficient nursing service and with  
the aid of visiting consultants and specialists.  
This remains a valid definition today.  
A framework of issues for doctors and architects to discuss  
together when developing a brief for a primary health building is

# 4 BRIEFING  
# 4.1 Objectives  
Doctors and architects need to work more closely together through  
the development of briefing documents. These play a key role in  
providing the physical framework within which the complex social  
interaction of the community can engage with the medical profession.  
The brief should\:  
• Be the central and fundamental cornerstone for the provision of  
the health care building. It should set out the ethos and culture  
for the health care environment.  
• Provide both strategic and practical levels of planning.  
• Set out the design aspirations. This establishes the sense of wonder  
which excites the spirit when good architecture is encountered.  
• Bring together current ideas and anticipate future trends.

# 4.3 Ethos  
Right at the beginning of the document there should be a section  
that encourages the design team to set out the quality aspirations  
expected from the building. This needs to encourage future users  
of the building to think about what the ethos of the building should  
be. It should set out what the building users want out of the build-  
ing, and what are the intangible values that the designers aim to  
achieve.  
For example, whether the building should be\:  
• Friendly  
• Efficient  
• Welcoming  
• Relaxing  
• Comfortable  
• Warm  
• Pleasant  
• Accessible.  
The brief should seek to encourage the achievement of high design  
standards through the eyes of the patient. The tests of functionality  
and cost should be a secondary, albeit essential, requirement of the  
procurement process for any new primary health care building.  
An example of surgery that makes good use of natural light,  
colour and warm materials is Central Surgery at Sawbridgeworth in  
Hertfordshire, designed by Hawkins\\Brown, Figure 32.1a&b.

After first establishing a framework of ethos and having understood  
the context and networking requirements for a particular building,  
the strategic components of a brief can be more precisely laid  
down. This is shown in Table III.  
# Table III Strategic components of a brief  
**Vision** How will the experience of visitors, patients and staff be  
enhanced by the building?  
How will the design quality add to the expectation of excellence?  
How will a high-quality environment be achieved?  
Will it be patient focused?  
**Process** Select an appropriate procurement method to ensure that  
design quality is not stifled  
**Urban design** Will the building contribute to the sense of place?  
Will transport linkages work?  
**Benchmarking** Is the building going to add to the level of competencies  
prevailing in the vicinity?  
**Value for money** Will it represent best value  
**Patient centred** Will the brief encourage good environmental design and  
achieve therapeutic benefits for patients and all other users  
of the building?  
Is it patient centred?  
# 4.5 Practical issues  
After the ethos of the project has been defined and the strategic  
objectives have been agreed, the practical issues of functionality,  
standards and cost can be explored. This should be done bearing in  
the mind the expectations and views of the patient as well as that  
of the health service provider. The following should be considered\:  
• Patient control of their environment in treatment rooms, waiting  
rooms and other spaces  
• Design of furnishings, fixtures and fittings  
• Flexibility in the layout of equipment within a space  
• Flexibility of use of a space  
• Environmental design standards and performance specifications  
• Compliance with access for the disabled  
• Transportation links \(on foot, cycle, car or public transport\)  
• Functionality  
• Landscaping  
• Building materials  
• Cost limits.  
# 5 GUIDANCE  
Design quality is now seen as a very important aspect of the pro-  
curement process for primary health care buildings. This is reflected  
in recent Department of Health \(DH\) publications.  
Primary and Community Care – Health Building Note 11–01\:  
Facilities for primary and community care services is essential  
reading for any architect working on a new primary care building.  
Part of a suite of Health Building Notes, this document sets out  
an approach to designing new facilities which recognises the need  
for flexibility, changing relationships and how to set out firm-  
ing up a brief that will result in user-friendly environments. The  
document does not provide detailed design guidance on specific  
rooms and spaces but refers planning and design teams to the fol-  
lowing publications for guidance on generic rooms and spaces\:  
• Health Building Note 00–02 – sanitary spaces  
• Health Building Note 00–03 – clinical and clinical support spaces  
• Health Building Note 00–04 – circulation and communication  
spaces.  
Health Building Note \(HBN\) 11–01 sets out best practice guidance  
on the section and zoning of facilities for delivering primary and  
community care services. The guidance is applicable to the follow-  
ing building types\:  
# Primary health care 32-5  
• GP premises  
• Health centres  
• Primary care centres  
• Resource centres  
• Urgent care centres \(including walk-in centres and minor inju-  
ries units\)  
• Community hospitals \(also known as intermediate care hospitals\).  
It describes the following\:  
• The range of services that may be delivered from primary and  
community care buildings  
• The types of space needed to deliver these services \(many of  
which are generic\)  
• The way to quantify these spaces for briefing purposes  
• The way spaces can be organised into zones to create efficient,  
flexible, user-friendly environments.  
This chapter has been written with the provision of new-build  
facilities in mind. The principles described apply equally to the  
refurbishment and extension of existing buildings. The document  
sets out\:  
# Strategic design issues  
• Design quality  
• Quality of place  
• Art and integrated design  
• Sustainability  
• NHS identity.  
# Functional design issues  
• Accessibility  
• Infection control  
• Wayfinding  
• Security  
• Emergency preparedness.  
HBN 11–01 sets out a list of criteria and offers an approach to the  
use of flexible space, which is multi-functional and time-managed.  
Strategies to maximise flexibility and adaptability include\:  
• Using generic patient/client contact spaces  
• Limiting the number of specialist spaces  
• Standardising room sizes and position of built-in equipment  
• Consider future engineering service requirements at the outset  
• Considering flexible and adaptable forms of construction  
• Developing a modular approach to planning and construction  
• Providing space for future expansion, if relevant.  
# 6 SPATIAL IMPLICATIONS  
# 6.1 Zoning  
Architecturally, different spaces might be zoned to make optimal  
integrated use of a primary care facility. This also highlights the  
need for the clustering of clinical services.  
All primary and community care buildings include the follow-  
ing types of space\:  
• Public spaces  
• Primary and community care spaces  
• Staff spaces.  
These different categories of space should be grouped together to  
create separate zones within the building. Figure 32.2 shows a zon-  
ing concept diagram. **32-6 Primary health care**  
**32.2** *Zoning concept diagram for new primary and community building*  
# 6.2 Activities  
Most primary and community care services involve one or more of  
the following activities\:  
• Counselling  
• Consultation  
• Examination  
• Diagnosis  
• Treatment  
• Physical therapy.  
These activities may occur on a planned basis \(for example spe-  
cialist outreach consulting\), unplanned basis \(for example urgent  
care or walk-in services\) or a combination of the two \(for example  
GP consultation\). This affects the way services are managed rather  
than the facilities required.  
Most activities involve a practitioner and an individual patient/  
client, although certain forms of physical therapy and counselling  
may take place in groups. Most activities can be delivered from the  
following generic patient/client contact spaces\:  
• Interview room  
• Consulting/examination room  
• Treatment room \(that is, with mechanical ventilation\)  
• Examination /physical therapy room  
• Group room.  
Generic patient/client contact spaces should be shared on a time-  
tabled basis to maximise their use unless required on a dedicated  
bases for full-time use.  
# 6.3 Treatments  
Treatment activity requires special consideration. Treatments  
given in primary and community care settings fall under a number  
of categories and can occur in different room types.  
*Non-invasive and minimally invasive treatments*  
A non-invasive procedure is one that does not break the skin, for  
example changing a dressing. A minimally invasive procedure is  
one that breaks or punctures the skin, for example injections and  
taking blood.  
These may take place in consulting/examination room, treat-  
ment room or examination/physical therapy room, depending on  
space requirements.  
*Invasive procedure*  
This is one that cuts the superficial layers of the skin, for example  
removal of moles, warts or corns, biopsies or any endoscopic pro-  
cedure accessing any body orifice. A local anaesthetic or sedation  
may be required with an invasive procedure.  
Most invasive procedures and certain procedures using rigid  
endoscopes can take place in a generic treatment room. In addi-  
tion, procedures that generate heat \(for example ultrasound\) and/or  
unpleasant odours \(for example tissue viability clinic\) should only  
take place in a treatment room \(that is, with mechanical ventilation\).  
Some invasive procedures may require all-round couch access,  
including access to the head of the couch.  
# 6.4 Room sizes and positions of built-in equipment  
Room sizes and dimensions should be standardised wherever pos-  
sible. While this may mean sizing up to some extent, it results **Primary health care 32-7**  
**32.3** *Standardised room sizes and positions of built-in equipment. Source\: Health Building Note 11–01*  
in rooms that can be adapted \(for alternative use\) more easily.  
Adopting a limited number of room sizes can lead to building lay-  
outs that use economic structural spans, stack efficiently and allow  
for nature cross-ventilation.  
The following room sizes, Figure 32.3**,** provide a good fit for  
most generic rooms in primary and community care buildings\:  
• 8 m2  
• 12 m2  
• 16 m2  
• 32 m2  
.  
The ability to standardise the position of built-in equipment  
\(for example clinical wash-hand basin\) will further enhance  
adaptability.  
Health Building Note 00–03 does not recommended a 12 m2  
room with single-sided couch access for use in primary and com-  
munity care buildings as it offers less space for equipment and  
patients/escorts than the 16 m2 room.  
A 16 m2 consulting/examination room with access to three sides **32.4** *Alternative layout for 16 sq m consulting/examination room*

# 6.5 Future engineering service requirements  
At the beginning of the design process, consideration should be  
given to which room functions are likely to change over time and  
the impact this will have on engineering service requirements. Two  
broad approaches are possible\:  
• Install sufficient engineering services at the outset to accommo-  
date future uses of the room  
• Provide adequate infrastructure capacity, plant room and con-  
tainment space to upgrade engineering services at a later date.  
Decisions over which approach to employ will be influenced by the  
ability to predict future changes in use, economic constraints and  
the need to satisfy any emergency preparedness provisions, which  
may require rapid conversion from one room type to another.  
Where it is decided to install engineering services at the outset  
to accommodate future use, controls can be used to set ventilation,  
temperature control and lighting systems at the appropriate levels.  
# 6.6 Flexible and adaptable forms of construction  
To ensure day-to-day flexibility, consider the use of\:  
• Acoustically treated folding partition walls between adjoining group  
rooms, allowing rooms to be opened up to create larger spaces  
• Changeable signage, allowing room names and routes to be eas-  
ily modified for individual sessions  
• Mobile, rather than fixed, equipment and furniture  
• Wireless and/or internet protocol technology, where appropriate  
• Standard data outlets \(for example, RJ45\) and common struc-  
tured wiring infrastructure to create a network for telephones,  
data and video.  
To ensure that buildings are adaptable in the longer term, consider  
the following\:  
• Use of framed construction allowing partition walls to be altered  
• Installation of suitable surface-fixed trunking to allow engineer-  
ing services outlets to be added or altered, particularly where  
large numbers and types of outlet are concentrated on a small  
space. This is subject to infection control requirements being met  
• Use of structured wiring for IT and communication systems and  
modular wiring systems for lighting and small power  
• Provision of adequate spare plant and service access space,  
including ceiling void depths and service access space, including  
ceiling void depths and service risers, to have sufficient capac-  
ity to accommodate anticipated future mechanical and electrical  
systems expansion and equipment replacement  
• Developing a modular approach to planning and construction.  
# 7 OUTLOOK  
As well as the impact of the pandemic as previously discussed, a  
number of other issues could affect the design of future primary  
health care buildings\:  
• There is increasingly awareness that the individual must be the  
centre of their own health care, or well-being.  
• The training of doctors is becoming more broadly based to  
provide a more well-rounded education. Humanities are being  
introduced to the curriculum of medical schools in recognition  
that doctors need to treat patients in a more holistic manner.  
• Requirements for health care are being assessed from the per-  
spective of patients’ needs, and there is recognition that the social  
agenda for health care needs to become more inclusive. This will  
lead to greater complexity in the organisation of services, and  
the crossing of boundaries between traditional concepts of health  
care and social services such as housing and the treatment of  
mental health issues.  
• The NHS wants quality, value and fast delivery, and the empha-  
sis is on DFM \(Design for Manufacture\) with offsite assembly as  
the way to addressing this.  
• Reducing the energy running costs of health care buildings using  
the Passivhaus approach.  
• Integration of primary health care services with care homes for  
the elderly. As the average lifespan increases, so does the need  
for social care to become fully integrated into the well-being of  
the whole community as soon as possible.  
# 8 CASE STUDY  
Ballymena Health and Care Centre, Ballymena, Northern Ireland  
Client\: Northern Ireland Health Estates  
Architects\: Keppie Design and Hoskins Architects  
Area\: 7000 m2  
Completed\: 2016  
# 8.1 Introduction  
Ballymena Health and Care Centre was completed for the Northern  
Trust, one of five health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland.  
It provides a one-stop centre for assessment, treatment and provi-  
sion of care to the local population.  
Services include\:  
• Six GP practices  
• Pharmacy  
• Acute, primary and community care clinics  
• Children’s wing for assessments and clinics  
• Diagnostic services such as X-rays  
• Community mental health team  
• Community dental service  
• Community nurse specialist services such as diabetes  
• Reablement services \(occupational therapy and wheelchair service\)  
• Allied health professionals such as physiotherapy services.  
# 8.2 Site  
The project is located within the existing Braid Valley Hospital site  
in Ballymena. It is positioned alongside Cushendall Road to the  
north of the historic hospital, which was originally a workhouse.  
# 8.3 Aims  
In addition to accommodating the appropriate clinical facilities for  
the integrated health and care services, the design team aimed to\:  
• Create a building with a positive civic presence that comple-  
ments the nearby former workhouse  
• Provide a welcoming, non-institutional environment  
• Create a clearly legible internal circulation  
• Maximise naturally lit and naturally ventilated spaces  
• Incorporate views to outside spaces and primary communication  
areas from patient waiting areas.  
# 8.4 Design  
A courtyard/atrium model was identified as the preferred building  
configuration. This delivered a simple layout with the three-storey  
atrium and courtyard acting as focal points, Figure 32.14a–c.  
With two storeys of clinical departments and a smaller third level  
of staff office accommodation, the health and care centre is massed to  
mediate between the three-storey workhouse and smaller nearby res-  
idential buildings. Designed with a robust architectural language, the  
building is defined by its distinctive saw-tooth roofline, Figure 32.15.  
Two storeys of accommodation continue around the courtyard.  
The central atrium is the social heart of the building, Figure 32.16.  
Around this are arranged six GP practices and a cafe. A series of

community spaces are located near the main entrances to allow  
them to operate outside the hours of the medical facility.  
The building was designed to achieve a BREEAM Very Good  
rating.  
# 8.5 Room modules  
Clinical departments are accommodated across two floors and arranged  
around the atrium and courtyard. The main room modules are\:  
• Consultation/examination rooms\: 16 m2 and 20 m2  
• Treatment rooms\: 15 m2, 16 m2 and 20 m2  
• Larger flexible areas\: 54 m2 to 77 m2 \(approximately\).

# 1.2 Product development  
Consumer requirements evolve with a desire for change, new styles  
of fashion and wider experiences of meals abroad. New concepts  
in food and beverage service operations are constantly being intro-  
duced and those which can be shown to be successful are invariably  
developed as specific product brands. Branding enables the same  
formula to be adapted to other sites as a chain of company owned,  
leased or franchised units with further advantages in marketing,  
customer confidence in quality and value, economies of scale  
and profitability. The development of new products also reflects  
socio-economic changes in an area, trends and influences on con-  
sumers such as promotion and health concerns \(Tables I and II\).

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Profile  
Restaurants and other facilities providing food and drink for con-  
sumption on the premises are labour intensive services which  
invariably operate in a highly competitive environment. These  
cover both *commercial businesses* aiming to attract the public  
and achieve profits from the investment and *semi-* or *non-com-*  
*mercial services* provided in institutions, places of employment  
and elsewhere. The latter need to meet specific requirements,  
including set cost limits, and are often operated by *catering con-*  
*tractors*. In all cases, the efficiency of every part of the operation  
needs to be maximised and this calls for careful planning and  
organisation.  
Customer choice will vary with individual circumstances such  
as the location, time available, spending power, experience and  
particular requirements. The characteristics of potential market  
demands can be classified and quantified and this is used in market  
research to identify suitable locations and facilities.  
The role of design in food service premises is to\:  
• Attract identified markets of customers and communicate a suit-  
able image \(merchandising\)  
• Create a comprehensive style and quality of ambience appropri-  
ate to customer expectations  
• Plan the layout, equipment, technical installations and operating  
systems as integral parts of the overall concept  
• Ensure the facility can meet the objectives, costs and other crite-  
ria set by the operator.  
The design must reflect the basic concept, including range of  
menu and food preparation involved, style of service and staffing  
requirements, space allocation, desired atmosphere and other fac-  
tors which influence customer choice.

# 1.3 Types of facility  
Eating and drinking establishments fall into a number of broad cat-  
egories\:  
• Commercial restaurants with self-service and waiter service  
operations, possibly licensed for sale of alcohol. Includes cafes  
and snack bars  
• Takeaways\: fast-food outlets with or without customer seating  
space, supplying prepared food for consumption off the premises  
• Hotels and resorts\: depending on standards, offering one or more  
restaurants, room service, banquets, bars, lounge services  
• Public houses, clubs\: alcohol sales with or without food service  
• Semi- or non-commercial operations providing meals as a ser-  
vice in educational and institutional establishments and for  
employees in places of work.  
**33-1** **33-2 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
Differences between these operations lie in\:  
• Variety of food offered  
• Method of service  
• Space and facilities available to the customer  
• Amount of food processed on site  
• Emphasis on the sale of alcoholic drinks  
• Décor and degree of sophistication  
• Price level.  
Boundaries between these factors can be blurred and the whole  
field is constantly changing.  
# 1.4 Location  
Location will determine the success or failure of a facility.  
Commercial food service establishments must be located where  
people need to obtain meals and refreshments such as\:  
• City and town centres  
• Resorts and visitor attractions  
• At stopping places along main highways  
• Airports, main railway stations  
• Shopping centres.  
These are best served by different types of outlets appropriate for  
the main markets involved. For instance, chain fast-food outlets are  
sited in busy high streets within city and town centres to attract a  
large demand from passers-by \(*footfall*\). Upmarket restaurants are  
usually in less prominent locations, in or near good hotels, prime  
commercial districts and high-class residential areas. Food services  
are also provided to complement existing business as in pubs and  
places which attract visitors.  
A balance has to be found between\:  
• The availability of customers  
• Cost of location and investment  
• Operational considerations such as space, customer parking,  
goods access.  
Major locations such as an airport or motor service station usually  
provide a selection of outlets allowing customer choice in types  
of meals, prices and time available \(Figure 33.1\). In city and town  
centres, there will usually be a range of different restaurants\: fast-  
food, bistros, international, themed, food speciality and high-spend  
restaurants, as well as pubs, wine bars, cafes and snack bars.  
Visibility is critical for casual trade and restaurants tend to be  
clustered in and around popular places, tourist attractions, squares  
and nearby side streets. Those sited in basements or on upper floors  
are at a disadvantage without specific promotion, attractive, easy  
access and designed facilities for transporting food deliveries and  
for the disabled.  
# 1.5 Institutional food services  
Food services provided in institutions and places of work generally  
fall into two categories\:  
• Centrally grouped\: main cafeteria, refectories and/or restaurants  
sited conveniently for most of the people involved. The location  
often provides a refreshing contrast to the workplace environ-  
ment and is adjacent to the food preparation facilities.  
• Dispersed\: remote service of food to individual stations such as  
in hospitals, some institutions and remote work sites.  
In most cases these catering services are operated by contractors  
specialising in this field.  
This also applies in other main locations such as airports, motor-  
way service stations and shopping centres.  
# 1.6 External considerations  
Separate vehicular access and parking is essential for delivery  
of food and other supplies together with suitable provision for  
hygienic storage and collection of waste. In large premises, a staff  
entrance may also be required. Outside city centres well served by  
taxis and public transport, customer car parking is essential, par-  
ticularly for evening dining and functions. Hotels need to make  
extra provision for this non-residential use. In restricted urban sites,  
nearby public car parking is an advantage.  
**33.1** *Food service facilities at Prestwick Airport, UK. Located on a balcony above the concourse, the self-service restaurant was designed*  
*to attract attention and provide an interesting range of local food specialities. Emphasis has been put on prominent signage and staircase*  
*design, as well as in menu graphics. Catering consultants\: Tricon Foodservice Consultants Ltd. Client\: British Airports Authority* **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-3**  
External appearance is important for self-advertising and com-  
municating information, with views of the interior, display of  
menus and prices and, for evening dining, flood lighting. The cus-  
tomer entrance must be clearly defined, distinctive and easy to use  
including provisions for people with disabilities. To attract passing  
customers, popular restaurants and cafes in large shopping centres,  
hotels, and airports may be seated within public concourses and  
atrium areas \(Figure 33.1\).  
# 2 BASIC PLANNING  
# 2.1 Food service operations  
All food service operations involve three overlapping processes\:  
production, service and customer areas \(Figure 33.2\). Each area  
will have specific requirements which will vary depending on the  
nature and scale of the operation.  
*Customer facilities*  
• Location\: surroundings, character, site restrictions, parking  
• Entrance with cloakroom, toilets, reception services and bar if  
required  
• Seating areas\: interior design to reflect concept and customer  
profiles  
• Billing and payment facilities.  
# 2.2 Central food production  
Large-scale food service operations usually involve two stages of  
production\: Bulk preparation and prime cooking followed by rapid  
chilling or freezing of the foods for later end-cooking \(regenera-  
tion\) when required near the place of service. *Cook-freeze* systems  
provide rapid cooling down to −20° C for frozen storage \(typical  
up to 1 month\) whilst *cook-chill* equipment rapidly reduces food  
temperature to 1–3° C for refrigeration storage up to a maximum  
of 3–5 days. Chilling is commonly used in hotels and institutions  
for pre-preparation of meals on site to improve efficiency and  
hygiene.  
Fast-food outlets use highly developed systems with special-  
ised end-cooking equipment designed to provide rapid delivery  
of a limited menu of meals to order. Central cook-freeze systems  
are also used to supply prepared convenience foods to restaurants,  
airlines and other offsite catering arrangements. Cook-chill sys-  
tems are more suitable for short time holding of meals prepared in  
advance of use, as in banquets and functions \(Figure 33.3\).  
# 2.3 Legislation  
Food service establishments are subject to Town and Country  
Planning and Building Regulations, disability discrimination,  
health and safety, food standards and hygiene requirements.  
Premises selling alcoholic drink must also be licensed. In the work  
areas, safeguards must be taken to reduce risks of accidents \(e.g.  
burns, scalds, cuts, falls, exposed machinery, electric shock and  
fires\). Instruction and first aid facilities must be provided. Hygiene  
requirements include training in food handling and the provision  
of suitable clothing and hand-washing facilities. Specific fire and  
smoke protection requirements apply.  
**33.2** *Food service planning*  
*Production*  
• Delivery and checking of food supplies, beverages and other items  
• Storage\: separate for vegetables/fruit, dry goods, chilled and fro-  
zen foods  
• Preparation\: using fresh ingredients, partially or fully prepared foods  
• Cooking\: with large-scale centrally grouped or back-bar equip-  
ment  
• Assembly of meals to order, ready for service or refrigeration/  
freezing  
• Dishwashing of utensils and tableware and disposal of solid waste.  
*Service of meals, designed around self-service or table service\:*  
Self-service using display counters accessible to the customers.  
• Waiter/waitress service collected from a servery and taken to the  
tables  
• Collection of soiled dishes and return to the kitchen  
• Side tables and storage\: for table items, condiments, equipment,  
furniture.

# 3 PUBLIC AREAS  
# 3.1 Concept  
Restaurant design is developed around the concept of the operation.  
This will take account of the intended market, the clients’ objec-  
tives and proposals, the location and type of premises, structural  
changes involved and cost targets. Brand-led designs, including  
franchised and licensed outlets, are usually limited in scope but  
may be adapted to the type of building available.  
The concept and operating strategies are invariably decided by  
the clients. Details of design may be set for brand consistency and  
customer assurance in chain operations. This applies particularly  
to middle and popular market requirements, including fast-food  
operations. However, entrepreneurs are also aware of social trends  
and changes in consumer requirements and new innovative design  
concepts are constantly being introduced.  
# 3.2 Marketing criteria  
Customer choice is influenced by price and expectations which vary  
depending on the occasion. Factors such as convenience, value and  
social atmosphere may be paramount. For others the sophistication,  
menu choice and style of service may by important. Markets can be  
classified according to socio-economic categories which broadly indi-  
cate spending power and types of services required. Market studies  
also assess competition, changes in the area and optimum locations. **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-5**  
# 3.3 Design criteria  
Interior design has to satisfy a number of requirements, both func-  
tional and aesthetic. It has to reassure confidence in standards,  
stimulate appropriate emotive responses, interest and visual appeal,  
and provide conditions which create the desired social atmosphere.  
Considerations include\:  
• *Function*\: operation, efficiency, order, hygiene, durability, main-  
tenance  
• *Ambience*\: luxurious, sophisticated, exotic, homely, romantic,  
lively  
• *Characterisation*\: operating style, theme, food specialisation,  
features  
• *Seating plans*\: room proportions, horizons of interest, windows,  
perimeters  
• *Perception\:* attention to detail, consistency, linkage of areas,  
personalisation.  
# 3.4 Coverage  
A comprehensive design scheme covers\:  
• Interior finishes, fittings and equipment, decoration  
• Theme design, furniture, furnishings and features  
• Tableware, linen, table appointments and uniforms  
• Display counters, service equipment and circulation plans  
• Lighting, air conditioning and technical installations  
• Motif, graphics, menu and drinks folders  
• Desks, registers and monitoring equipment.  
Shop-fitting frontage, entrance, cloakroom and ancillary bars  
are normally included. Kitchen equipment including their technical  
plant, services installation and utensils may be treated as a separate  
contract but must be planned as part of the whole project. Client  
requirements for accounting and management systems and equip-  
ment must also be incorporated.  
# 3.5 Seating plans  
For meals consumed on the premises, maximum numbers of cus-  
tomers are dictated by numbers of seats \(covers\), mealtimes served  
and seat turnover. Customer densities \(in m2 per diner\) depend on  
the room dimensions, method of service, table and chair sizes, seat  
groupings and layout within the room \(Figures 33.4, 33.5, 33.6;  
Table III\).  
• Functions, banquets and conference groups require adaptable  
stackable furniture \(Figure 33.7–33.10\).  
• Self-service requires wide aisles leading to and from the  
counter\(s\), orderly lines with increased space between tables  
\(Figure 33.5\). Waiter service layouts can be more flexible but  
service and customer circulations must not conflict.  
• Table and chair sizes increase with sophistication and length of  
meal. Popular restaurants mostly provide tables for four which  
may be fixed or loose, square or round, in open or booth-type  
layouts depending on style of operation. High-spend restaurants  
provide a higher ratio of tables for two, often allowing grouping  
together for parties of four, six or more as required. Employee  
and institutional arrangements use rows of tables to increase  
density which may also be removeable for alternative use of the  
area.  
• Layouts are influenced by windows and views. Individual seat-  
ing areas may be separated by levels and partitions to extend  
choice \(personalised areas, perimeter seating\) and interest \(fea-  
tures\).  
• Large hotels and resorts provide a choice of restaurants and  
facilities offering different menus, sophistication and prices

Note\: Depends on room dimensions, circulations and type of furniture.  
# 3.6 Furniture and table top design  
Restaurant furniture must be strong, durable and resistant to soil-  
ing. Depending on the type of operation, this includes\: **33-6 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.6** *Restaurant critical dimensions*  
**33.7** *Small formal dinner arrangement*  
**33.8** *Banquet layout. The U arrangement can be extended in both*  
*directions to the limits of the banqueting room*  
• Fitted counters and bars. Fixed bar/counter stools. Fixed tables,  
usually pedestal or cantilevered for leg clearance, with loose  
chairs or fixed booth-type seating \(Figures 33.12 and 33.13\)  
• Moveable tables with loose chairs or fixed banquette seating  
• Stackable tables and chairs with carrier systems. Tables with  
extension brackets or alternative tops \(square/round\). With level  
access to storage area  
• Side tables and designed trolleys for food presentation and ser-  
vice at the table  
• Reception and cash desks with terminals, screens, cash registers  
and other equipment.  
Table top design must be compatible with the overall concept and style  
of operation. It will range from high class sophistication requiring

**33.10** *Recommended circular table sizes for various place*  
*numbers*  
quality linen, china, glassware and silverware to stylised easy clean  
laminated surfaces with durable ware and stainless steel utensils.  
# 3.7 Steps in interior design  
• Brief, terms of reference\: scope, aims, guidance, requirements,  
programme  
• Sketches, proposals\: design concept, visual ideas, preliminary  
estimates  
• Schematic drawings\: perspectives, images, key features  
• Sample board\: selected materials, finishes  
• Detailed drawings\: scaled drawings for construction and instal-  
lations  
• Specifications\: requirements, quality, quantities  
• Suppliers\: sources, costs, discounts, replacements  
• Contracts\: conditions, coverage of work, critical dates.  
# 3.8 Maintenance and life cycle planning  
Food and beverage service areas are subject to intensive use, break-  
age, spillage and damage requiring daily cleaning and frequent  
replacement or substitution. Carpets and finishes are selected to  
camouflage scratching or staining. Furniture and equipment must be  
durable and retain good appearance over the planned lifetime of use.  
Flexibility may be required to adapt to variable needs such as  
table groupings and re-arrangements or changes in service style  
from daytime to evening dining or for entertainment. This will call  
for furniture stacking and equipment storage facilities  
The life cycle of a restaurant will be affected by many factors  
such as changes in the surroundings, fashion and meal preferences;  
increasing competition; decline in standards and obsolescence.  
Kitchen equipment is usually planned for 7 years usage but  
furniture and furnishings may need replacement in 5 years. In plan-  
ning major refurbishments, it is opportune to revise the original  
# 4 FOOD PRODUCTION AREAS  
# 4.1 Size and type  
The size of the kitchen depends on the number of seats \(covers\)  
served at the peak period of demand – lunch or evening. It will  
also vary with the type of the menu and the extent to which food  
is prepared in advance. With a fixed menu, equipment and labour  
can be rationalised and ready-prepared food enables the kitchen to  
concentrate on finishing the meals to order. Conventional kitch-  
ens providing a varying \(usually cyclical\) range of menu choice  
are required in institutions and employee catering. They are also  
required in high-class restaurants and hotels and have a size ratio of  
0.3 to 0.5\:1 in relation to the size of the dining area. Convenience  
food is prepared in advance in bulk in central kitchens and chilled  
or frozen for distribution and storage prior to use \(see Section 2.1\).  
This allows economies of scale, larger, purpose designed equipment  
and factory type processing. Finishing kitchens can be reduced in  
size and equipment with a size ratio of 0.1 to 0.3\: 1 in relation to the  
size of storage and dishwashing.  
Examples of kitchen areas are indicated in Table IV. Space  
requirements in large kitchens show the economies of scale by cen-  
tralisation \(Figure 33.14\). In large hotels, a central food production  
and dishwashing area may be located to serve a number of alter-  
native restaurants directly or by circulation to more remote outlets  
such as in room service and banquet serveries.  
# 4.2 Goods access  
For sizes of vehicles, see Chapter 38. Typical delivery arrange-  
ments are\:  
• Dry goods\: weekly or fortnightly  
• Frozen goods\: weekly  
• Vegetables and fresh fruit\: twice weekly  
• Perishable foods\: daily  
• Refuse and waste removal\: depends on size and contract\: weekly.  
Large premises use bulk refuse containers \(0.57 m2–0.85 m2\)  
together with separate bottle, broken glass, metal compaction and **33-8 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.12** *Typical counter and table service dimensions*  
packaging storage areas. Food waste must be sited in a refrigerated  
area \(3–5° C\) with suitable screening, vermin exclusion, washing  
facilities and drainage.  
# 4.3 Storage areas  
Storage depends on throughput and frequency of deliveries. Cold  
stores are grouped together and preferably entered through chilled  
holding areas to save energy. Floor slabs may need to be recessed  
to allow level wheeled entry to the store. Vegetable stores have  
direct access to their preparation area.  
Purpose designed movable racks are used in food stores. Racks and  
shelves should allow about 50 mm between and above packages for  
easy access. The top shelf should not be higher than 1800 mm and the  
lowest at least 200 mm above floor \(Figure 33.15\). Shelves for heavy  
and frequently used items are best between 700 and 1500 mm high.  
Space may be required for containers awaiting return to suppliers. **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-9**  
**33.13** *Dimensions for various tables and local seating densities*  
# 4.4 Preparation areas  
Kitchen areas and layout are determined by\:  
# Table IV Typical food production areas per restaurant seat  
• The sizes of equipment and benches  
• Space for working access and circulation.  
Some typical dimensions are\:  
• Work top and sink rim height 870–900 mm  
• Wall bench width 600–750 mm  
• Island bench or table width 900–1050 mm  
• Length of work area with convenient reach 1200–1800 mm.

Four main areas are required for conventional food preparation\:  
• Fresh vegetables, salads and fruit  
• Meat and fish  
• Pastry  
• General including assembly of cold foods.  
Note\: Preparation, cooking and dishwashing take up about 50 per cent of the total  
kitchen areas. Storage, service and staff facilities the remainder.  
Specialised operations may require separate bakery and cake dec-  
oration areas. Preparation areas may be segregated in separate  
rooms, by low walls 1200 mm high between the areas and main  
kitchen or the grouping of benches and fittings in specific areas  
around the sides \(Figure 33.16\). Cross-contamination of food must  
be avoided and adequate work space with separate sinks provided  
in each area as well as for pan washing. **33-10 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.14** *Kitchen space requirements for various functions*  
**33.15** *Heights for storage shelving*  
# 4.5 Cooking equipment  
About 30 per cent of the kitchen floor is occupied by equipment,  
10–20 per cent by benches and trolleys and 50 per cent for cir-  
culation and access. Crowded space can lead to obstruction and  
accidents but excess space adds to circulation cleaning, energy and  
maintenance costs \(Figure 33.17\).  
Details of typical modern equipment are given in Table V.  
Size and duty is related to output and most ovens are designed to  
receive gastronorm sizes of dishes and trays. Some items are shown  
\(Figure 33.18\). Combination ovens incorporate both steam and hot  
air convection modes. Other accelerated cooking includes micro-  
wave power with hot air convection. Vitreoceramic induction hobs  
may be used instead of open burners.  
A typical kitchen layout is shown in Figure 33.19 with eleva-  
tions in Figure 33.20.  
Back-bar equipment fitted along a wall behind the serving coun-  
ter is common in small kitchens and for finishing meals enabling  
savings in engineering services, space and labour. Island grouping  
in the centre is better in larger units giving easier access from all  
areas, cleaning and maintenance. Engineering services, including  
fume extraction and floor drainage, are concentrated and perimeter  
sites can be used for refrigerators, storage, preparation areas and  
**33.16** *Alternative preparation area arrangements \(see 33.31 for*  
*key to numbers\)*  
service counters. The minimum aisle width is 1050 mm but may  
need to be increased to 1500 mm to allow for cooker door swings  
or if trolleys are used.  
# 4.6 Dishwashing  
Dishwashing is expensive in terms of space, equipment, labour and  
energy costs. Disposables may be used in fast-food and transport  
catering but give a poor image and problems in disposal. Methods  
of collection for used dishes include self-removal with trays, trol-  
leys or waiter removal. This must be decided at the initial planning  
stage. Trolleys will require straight aisles with minimum 1050 mm  
width and screened trolley parks. **33.17** *Minimum space between equipment for working and*  
*circulation*  
# Restaurants and food service facilities 33-11  
Manual dishwashing in a double sink is inefficient and unhygienic  
for public food services. Spray machines may be intermittent or  
continuous through-flow and designed for corner \(small kitchens\)  
or in line position \(Figure 33.21\). Water softening is often used and  
modern machines incorporate energy and water saving devices.  
Space is required for depositing soiled dishes, scraping/spraying  
and loading as well as separate unloading sections. Trolley spaces  
should be allowed for return of clean dishes and utensils to the  
servery. Typical sizes for tableware are given in Table VI and  
allowances for dishwashing spaces are show in Table VII.  
# 4.7 Serveries  
Arrangements for plating and serving food depend on the type and  
scale of operation. In each case, circulation routes must be planned.  
Counters are designed to avoid risk of accidents, spillages and con-  
tamination, keep food hot, cool or chilled and retain an attractive  
hygienic presentation of the foods on offer.  
# Table V Kitchen equipment

# Restaurants and food service facilities  
*Waiter/waitress service*  
Service counter sited within the production area with hot, cold and  
refrigerated sections, shelves for plates and dishes and adjacent  
pantry area for supplementary serving items. Provided with a lobby  
which must be noise and glare screened from the dining area and  
have separate in-out doors, opening in direction of flow. May be  
supplemented by\:  
• Sideboard\(s\) within dining area  
• Side table or trolley circulation, including flambé preparation/  
service at the table  
• Featured display cooking section for special dishes  
• Family service or self-selection from dishes brought to the table.  
*Self-service*  
Serving counter arranged for self-selection of meal items with  
planned circulations for customers and food replacement \(Figure  
33.22\). Display counters arranged in sequence of meal choice.  
Variations include\:  
• Cafeteria style service for high throughput and sales promotion  
• Food hall and food court service with alternative counters and a  
common seating area  
• Temporary or installed buffet presentations, including assisted  
service at the counter  
• Snack and/or beverage vending machines with or without seat-  
ing areas.  
*Central service*  
Distribution of centrally prepared dishes as hot, chilled or frozen  
foods to other locations for service. Central production calls for a  
fully integrated system, with standardised containers, equipment,  
transport and controls. Examples include\:  
• Commissary systems to supply meals to finishing kitchens and  
in transit  
• Hospital systems to distribute meals to wards and individual  
patients  
• Banqueting systems to prepare meals in advance of functions  
• Central production of convenience foods for catering and res-  
taurant outlets.  
# 4.8 Facilities for staff  
Employee ratios vary widely with the type of establishment and  
demand. The ratio of total employees to meals served over the peak  
period is about one employee to eight meals served for full-menu,  
table service restaurants, 20 meals in limited menu table service  
and institutions, and 33 or more in fast-food outlets. Changing  
rooms, lockers and sanitary facilities are required for total full and  
part-time employees.  
# 5 RESTAURANTS  
# 5.1 Investment  
Commercial restaurants are affected by location, image, associa-  
tion and publicity. Location is critical in dictating the catchment  
area and potential market which may be based on local or tran-  
sient customers. The image and association helps to create demand.  
However, sustained success depends on the customers’ valuation  
of the meal experience.  
Commercial restaurants are notoriously subject to fashion. They  
tend to have a short life, not often more than 8 years, and both  
the types of food served and facilities may need to be frequently  
changed. Investment has to be recovered within the planned life  
cycle period, requiring careful control of finance and operation.  
Full-service, high-class restaurants are only 5 per cent of  
establishments. The mid-market range includes steak and seafood  
restaurants, grilles, brasseries and most international restaurants.  
Commercial restaurants usually offer table service but self-service  
\(see Section 6.1\) from attractive counter displays is common in  
departmental stores and some of the larger mid-market restaurants  
for convenience and sales promotion.  
# 5.2 International restaurants  
In Britain, the increase of international restaurants – particularly  
Chinese and Indian/Pakistani – has displaced many of the tradi-  
tional establishments. International restaurants are the main choice  
for evening dining. Design is often symbolic rather than authentic  
and it is essential to research the types of foods, spices, traditional  
preparation and cooking methods represented. Specialist cooking  
equipment is often required to supplement the standard range nor-  
mally used and in international hotels separate Western, Oriental **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-13**

*33.31\)*  
and other types of finishing kitchens are required to serve the vari-  
ety of restaurants provided \(Figure 33.23\).  
International restaurants cover a wide range of quality and  
sophistication. The range of food choice is ever increasing with  
travel, holidays abroad and migration. Chinese food divides  
into four regions\: Canton, Peking, Szechuan and Shanghai. The  
kitchens need to provide the extensive menus which can be up  
to 300 items. ‘Indian’ food is strongly spiced and much of it  
can be cooked by standard equipment although special ovens  
may also be used. Japanese food is subtle\: preparation and  
service are seen as an art form and used as part of the presenta-  
tion. Scandinavian food usually requires a counter display of  
smoked food, fish and cold meats. Greek restaurants are often  
designed as peasant-style tavernas and this approach is common  
in Turkish, Mexican, Spanish, Thai and other popular interna-  
tional restaurants. These traditionally use family service with a  
series of communal food dishes brought to the table. Italian food  
is more universal ranging from themed trattorie to specialised  
pizza chain outlets with purpose designed ovens and preparation  
areas \(Figure 33.24\).  
# 6 CAFETERIAS AND FOOD HALLS  
# 6.1 Cafeterias  
Self-service is mainly used in employee, educational and insti-  
tutional catering, airports, motorway service stations and other  
locations which serve large numbers of people at peak meal times  
or in which time for meals is limited.  
Characteristics\:  
# 5.3 Cafes, coffee bars and snack bars  
Typically, these have limited space and seating. The menu range of  
food offered is short and simply produced, normally operated with  
counter service and back-bar equipment. Beverages are an impor-  
tant product, particularly in the more specialised coffee bar chains.  
Cafes tend to emphasise a domestic character and are often located  
in shopping and visitor areas. Snack bars and sandwich bars have  
very restricted seating areas and primarily cater for local work-  
ers and others requiring snack meals or takeaway food prepared  
to order. Compact table or booth areas and/or counter seating are  
used. Chains of specialist coffee bars have expanded into almost  
every town using standard designs and equipment which offer a  
quick service of selected coffee beverages and pastries in comfort-  
able surroundings.  
• Scale of operation\: usually large numbers of meals served allow-  
ing economies of scale in production.  
• Concentrated demand\: a short service period or limited time  
available for a meal demands a high rate of service with  
minimum delay. Above 600 meals per day, free-flow and mul-  
ti-counter service is practical and the counters are often grouped  
in a food hall separate from the seating areas.  
• Space\: counters add 0.2–0.3 m2 to area per seat in the dining room.  
• The average rate of customer flow through a single counter is  
six to nine persons per minute, dictated mainly by the speed of  
beverage service, cash payments and variety of menu choice.  
• By-pass arrangements, duplication of the counter and cash point  
can increase the flow to 14–16 persons per minute. Beverage  
service may be in a separate area.  
• Larger numbers require multi-counter choices, each serving par-  
ticular types of meals and these may be arranged in a food hall  
separate from the seating areas.  
• The layout must allow for direct access to the production area for  
easy food replacement.  
• Menus\: balanced to meet nutritional standards. The extent of  
choice will determine counter layout and length.  
• Counter sections are heated or refrigerated and fitted out for food  
holding and display. Critical features are the design of tray slides,  
easy access to the food items with protection from contamination.  
• Cash-out desks are sited at or near the end of the service lines, dupli-  
cated where necessary and fitted with tray slide waiting areas. Cutlery,  
condiment and so on stands must be sited to avoid congestion. **33-16 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.20** *Elevations of installed kitchen equipment \(continued opposite\)*  
Self-service arrangements require seating areas to be  
arranged in regular order with wide aisles, particularly in the cir-  
culation to and from the serving counters. Self-clearance or/and  
trolleys may be used. Furniture must be durable, easily cleaned  
and retain good appearance. Counter arrangements are shown  
in Figures 33.25, 33.26 and 33.27 indicate equipment require-  
ments although these will depend on the type and range of menu.  
To minimise food handling, counters are designed to receive  
standard gastronorm containers \(Figure 33.28\). An example of  
a midsized employee cafeteria is shown in Figure 33.29 and a  
large hospital arrangement in Figure 33.30 with the standard key  
for three kitchens in Figure 33.31. A large-scale, multi-choice  
layout is illustrated in Figure 33.32 and a large employee service  
in Figure 33.33.  
# 7 FAST-FOOD OUTLETS AND TAKEAWAYS  
# 7.1 Fast-food systems  
Fast food has been a rapidly growing sector accounting for about  
one-third of the market for meals outside the home. Outlets  
mainly concentrate on a limited range of popular products such as **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-17**  
**33.20** *Elevations of installed kitchen equipment \(continued\)*  
**33.21** *Alternative layouts for wash-up areas, with equipment dimensions*

production and costs to ensure fixed competitive prices. Most out- to finance high investment and operating costs.  
lets are chain operated.  
Investment costs are high with sophisticated equipment **7.2 Operation**  
designed for high volume output with low skill operatives. Most fast-food operators aim for a maximum door time \(entering  
Locations are critical and prime high street sites having large pave- to leaving\) of 3.5 minutes, 2.5 minutes queueing and one minute  
ment flows are preferred for major franchised units. The average serving. Counters are designed for rapid ordering and service with **33-18 Restaurants and food service facilities**

multiple stations. Production processes use automated equipment  
with control over cooking and holding time, portions and additions  
\(Figure 33.33\).  
Food is delivered to outlets ready prepared, portioned and frozen or  
chilled. The entire procedure is tightly controlled and unsold hot food  
kept only a fixed period then discarded. Employees have specific roles  
as till operators, backers and crew. Disposable containers are used for  
all food and beverage items and suitably designed waste receptacles  
and cleaning services must be provided in store and the vicinity.  
Depending on the type of outlet, most fast-food stores also pro-  
vide table and counter seating areas for meals on trays. These are  
grouped clear from the takeaway routes and may be on upper or  
lower floors. Seating areas are designed for a high turnover, with  
self-service and self-clearance. Arrangements include fixed tables  
and seats, loose seats and wall counter seating. High standards of  
hygiene, cleaning and maintenance are important in system design.  
Trends are towards health conscious eating with emphasis on lower  
fat, salt and sugar products and additional choice of salads, vege-  
tarian, fresh fruit, yoghurt and real juices.  
pizza, pies and pastries to pre-packed sandwiches and vended bev-  
erages. Some include limited table and counter seating areas. Many  
popular and international restaurants also offer a takeaway facility,  
some with home delivery.  
# 7.3 Food courts  
Food courts are provided to offer a wider range of choice with a  
number of food outlets serving alternative products grouped around  
a common seating area. They may be provided in shopping centres,  
airports, universities and other places where the demand is high.  
Serving counters are backed by end-cooking, preparation and stor-  
age areas supplied from a service corridor \(Figure 33.34\).  
# 7.4 Other food service outlets  
Food and refreshment services are required by motorists, coaches and  
truck drivers. These are mainly grouped with filling stations, lodges and  
other services at convenient stopping places along main routes, near  
major junctions and within scenic tourist attractions \(Figure 33.34\).  
Snack bars, most delicatessens and food shops offer food ready  
for consumption off the premises. This may range from products  
freshly prepared, baked or cooked to order, including fish and chips,  
# 8 PUBLIC HOUSES  
# 8.1 Licensing  
The requirements of public houses and wine bars are different from  
other food service outlets in that alcohol sales are the dominant  
rather than a subsidiary activity. Licenses to sell alcoholic liquor  
are granted only if the applicant and premises are suitable for the  
purpose. Safety, means of escape, sanitary facilities and separa-  
tion of bars from other areas must be approved before a license  
is granted as well as approval of any structural alterations before  
renewal. Few new public houses are built. The majority of works  
are alterations to update the facilities and provide food services.  
# 8.2 Separation  
Pubs require two separate parts\:  
• Public areas\: bars, lounges, dining areas, toilets and circulation  
used by customers  
• Private areas\: serveries, storage \(cellars\), kitchen and accommo-  
dation used by staff.  
Most pubs traditionally offer a choice of public bar and lounge  
areas. Drink storage areas must be easily accessible to each bar  
servery. Access to the kitchen is required for taking food orders  
from the counter and serving food directly to the dining area.  
The main pub entrance and secondary entrances from car parks  
are usually through lobbies to control temperature and air condi-  
tioning. Facilities must provide suitably located toilets of adequate  
size, separated for men, women and disabled and entered through  
a screened, ventilated lobby. Relationships between areas are illus-  
trated \(Figure 33.35\) in a modernised town pub. **33-20 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.26** *Servery equipment*  
# 8.3 Pub meals  
Most pubs offer meals to boost their sales by attracting a wider  
clientele and increased use of existing facilities and staff. Usually  
a separate room or area of the lounge is used for food service with  
access \(directly or via food hoist\) to the kitchen. In country inns,  
glass-house extensions are common to extend the space into a  
garden environment. Most menus are standardised around popu-  
lar choices with daily special additions to add variety – often with  
blackboard listings. Much of the food is bought in ready prepared.  
Kitchens are typically fitted with back-bar equipment \(e.g. micro-  
wave oven, grill, griddle, convection oven, boiling hob\), together  
with preparation worktops, sinks, dishwasher, under-bench cup-  
boards and refrigerators including chilled salad and food counters.  
An example of a pub conversion is shown \(Figure 33.36\).  
**33.25** *Alternative arrangements for self-service counters*  
# 8.4 Drink storage and bars  
Traditional drink storage is in naturally cool cellars with CO2  
pressure or pumps to transfer ale and other brewed drinks from  
metal kegs or barrels to ground floor bars. Access to adjacent truck  
bays must be provided for deliveries \(Figures 33.37, 33.38, 33.39,  
33.40\). Temperature control is critical and cooling may be required **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-21**  
**33.27** *Self-service counter* **33-22 Restaurants and food service facilities**

**33.31** *Standard key for three kitchen examples*  
for the ‘cellar’ \(including secure wine stores\) and may be installed  
in the pipeline to dispense cold beer and other beverages. Pipelines  
are contained in ducts, usually insulated and may supply more than  
one floor level \(Figure 33.41\). Hoists can be used to transport cases  
of drinks.  
Drink serveries are usually centrally located to serve more than  
one room and provide a bar counter, and back-bar fitting with work  
space between having access to the bar store. Counter lengths vary  
but the height and width are standard. A worktop with inset sink is  
provided below the counter top and dispense points. The back bar  
is designed as a decorative feature and includes a sideboard with  
cooled shelves, a display for spirits \(‘optics’\), wine and glasses, cash  
register, cooler and glass washing machine \(Figures 33.42, 33.43\).  
An alternative choice of bars is often provided and one may be  
adapted for food service. A high proportion of drinkers stand at  
the bar and stools may be fitted or loose. Traditional pub tables are  
heavy, with cast iron base or wood frame, and used with peninsular  
seating and stools.  
Depending on trade, drinking bars often provide a large screen  
television for sports interests and areas may be set aside for darts,  
pool, game machine\(s\) and a piano \(Figure 33.44\). Located mainly  
in city commercial districts, wine bars are more upmarket and often  
offer a bistro-type food outlet. Cocktail bars are sophisticated in  
design and service style, usually associated with high class dining  
facilities, hotels and clubs.  
# 8.5 Clubs  
Clubs tend to specialise in late entertainment together with sales  
of beverages. Food may be served as in night clubs. In each case,  
the design is specific to create the desired atmosphere and mode **33-24 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.32** *Example of large-scale catering using multi-choice counters*  
**33.33** *Fast-food outlet*  
of operation. Entertainers require changing rooms with direct  
access to the stage. Sophisticated lighting, projection and sound  
systems with programmed control equipment are required as well  
as discotheque music centres. A traditional bandstand is illus-  
trated \(Figure 33.45\).  
# 9 HOTELS AND RESORTS  
# 9.1 Hotels and cruise ships  
Hotels are graded according to the quality of accommodation,  
price and range of services offering to guests. The extent of res-  
taurant provision will also depend on the location and number **Restaurants and food service facilities 33-25**  
**33.34** *Gatwick food court*  
**33.35** *Example of a modernised town pub*  
of rooms. Typical space allowances are shown. Food production  
arrangements are rationalised to enable the main kitchen to supply  
several outlets directly or via satellite kitchens \(Figure 33.11\). An  
example of food production in a large international hotel is shown  
in Figure 33.23.  
A high-grade city centre hotel with more than 200 rooms will  
usually provide at least two restaurants offering choice between  
fine dining and coffee shop style operation – this also serves  
the peak breakfast demand \(Figure 33.46\). Resident demand for  
midday meals is often limited and a speciality restaurant may be  
featured to attract outside market interest. A hotel of this stand-  
ard will also provide room service of meals, banquets for group  
meetings and events and meals for staff. Separate lobby, lounge,  
bar and restaurants may be designed to allow spatial continuity  
\(Figure 33.47\).  
Resort hotels of high grade also offer guests and visitors a  
choice of restaurants and bars, including poolside bars. Bar and  
dining areas are commonly grouped together to serve evening **33-26 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.37** *Cellar flap and barrel chute for below*

entertainment. In mid-grade establishments, restaurant and bar  
provision is rationalised and budget accommodation may use  
external restaurants in the vicinity. Food production is generally  
centralised.  
Cruise ships are broadly similar to high-grade hotels and need  
to provide a variety of food service outlets and bars to accommo-  
date the number of passengers and crew involved. These services  
are often an important part of cruise attraction and are linked to  
entertainment and other facilities. Menu planning is complex to  
take account of dietary requirements, choice, variety of outlets,  
supply provisions and hygiene standards. Extensive storage and  
preparation facilities are involved with added fresh foods at pre-ar-  
ranged supply ports.  
**33.45** *A band platform. Club entertainers use own equipment*  
# 9.2 Resorts and attractions  
Self-contained holiday centres and villages offer food service  
options, ranging from all-inclusive to self-catering facilities. In  
a large complex, a variety of themed restaurants, cafes, bars and  
other outlets is provided, often operated independently under  
license. Large visitor attractions usually need to provide cafes and  
restaurants as part of the facilities. These are invariably operated by  
catering contractors who supply the food partially or fully prepared  
to rationalise kitchen and staff requirements. **33-28 Restaurants and food service facilities**  
**33.47** *Ladbroke Hotel. The restaurant \(90 seats\) is operated with a carvery buffet counter and table service of starters and sweets. The*  
*drinks bar allows dual purpose use of the lounge with areas separated by changes in floor level, balustrades and screens*

Those retailers maintaining a viable and sustainable physical  
presence in the high street or mall are increasingly looking towards  
technology to better understand their customers and their behav-  
iour. The combination of customer tracking and machine learning  
has given retailers better insights into customer demographics,  
footfall, dwell time, conversion rate and loyalty.  
# 1.3 Retail locations  
The area of retail space in occupation in 2020 in the UK was  
77.1 billion m² \(source\: Cushman & Wakefield, July 2020\). High  
street stores accounted for 36.8 billion m², shopping centres and  
malls for 17.6 billion m² and retail parks for 10.7 billion m². The  
remaining areas are found in transport hubs, stand-alone sites and  
other minor developments.  
Changes in the town planning legislation since 1996 mean that  
the development of new regional malls on greenfield or brownfield  
sites has now ceased. Recent shopping centre developments have  
therefore tended to sit within the existing retail districts of towns  
and cities where they are seen as key components of urban regen-  
eration.  
Transport hubs have become increasingly important to retailers,  
particularly in airports where greater amounts of airside retail space  
have been provided by airport operators.  
The Office for National Statistics defines a high street as a clus-  
ter of 15 or more retail addresses located within 150 metres of one  
another, and calculates that there are almost 7000 high streets in the  
UK. They are the location where the greatest number and variety  
of stores are found, with around one-third of all UK high street  
addresses being occupied by a retailer \(source\: Office for National  
Statistics\).  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 General  
Retail outlets comprise buildings, rooms or other spaces from  
which goods and services are sold to the public. Wholesale, or busi-  
ness-to-business sales are usually excluded from the field of retail  
design, as are buildings concerned with the fulfilment of online orders.  
# 1.2 Retail in the United Kingdom  
The proportion of online sales has risen steadily since 2008, when  
it stood at 5 per cent of the total value of sales, to 20 per cent of the  
£378 billion total in 2019 \(source\: Office for National Statistics\).  
In 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, the proportion of  
online sales exceeded 30 per cent of the total value of retail sales.  
Typically, retail activity contributes around 5 per cent to the UK’s  
GDP and is responsible for around 10 per cent of the UK’s employ-  
ment \(source\: Moody’s Analytics\).  
In the face of the rising cost of maintaining ‘brick and mortar’  
or physical stores, retailers are particularly sensitive to maximising  
sales during the ‘golden quarter’, or the three months leading to  
Christmas and New Year and including Black Friday. The latter is  
now embedded in the UK shoppers’ psyche, having been imported  
as a sales event from the USA in 2013. As commercial pressures  
have increased on retailers, the number of retail outlets has stead-  
ily declined and by the end of 2019, the vacancy rate stood at  
around 10 per cent \(source\: Springboard Research\). In 2020, the  
UK Government announced its intention to change town planning  
legislation to make it easier to change the use of retail premises.  
This is likely to accelerate the irreversible loss of retail sites in the  
UK’s high streets.

# 2 TERMINOLOGY  
# 2.1 Shopping activities  
The majority of retail activity is conducted through physical stores.  
The remaining activity is non-store retail comprising online, mail  
order and teleshopping. Many retailers operate in an omni-channel  
environment where sales are promoted and achieved through both  
actual and virtual marketplaces, social media and other communi-  
cation touch points.  
# 2.2 Retail sub-sectors  
The UK Standard Industrial Classification \(SIC\) categorises  
economic activity into various types as shown in Table I. This clas-  
sification provides a framework for a statistical analysis of retail  
activity which is used for the reporting of indices such as the retail  
price index \(RPI\).  
# 2.3 Locations  
Retailing in the UK exists in a wide variety of locations that are a  
result of historic development over many hundreds of years and  
more recently determined by local and national development poli-  
cies. The main ones are described next.

*High street*  
The majority of all physical retail sites are located in high  
streets. These are found in towns and cities and might include  
the street frontage of shopping centres. High streets contain a  
variety of non-retail uses including, food and beverage outlets,  
professional services offices, residential, leisure and entertain-  
ment venues.  
*Urban fringe*  
This is often brownfield land or land parcels within redevelopment  
zones. Large format stores are typical occupiers, including super-  
markets, DIY stores and discount stores.  
*Out of town*  
These sites are located close to motorway or main road junc-  
tions, allowing easy access to a large population catchment.  
Occupiers include the UK’s major regional malls, shopping  
centres and outlet villages offering food and beverage alongside  
leisure operators.  
Retail locations are analysed and selected against a number of  
criteria.  
*Catchment*  
This is the size of population within a given distance of the site and  
the socio-economic and demographic profile of that population. As  
well as the permanent population, consideration is also given to  
seasonal or tourist shoppers.  
*Accessibility*  
This is the proximity to and availability of public transport, journey  
times and car parking provision.  
*Attractions*  
These are the range of goods, services and other attractions within  
a given location.  
*Deterrents*  
These include development costs and lease conditions.  
*Economic*  
saturation.  
These criteria consider the maturity of the market and market  
# 2.4 Selling methods  
*Personal service*  
This is individual service, typically over counters or desks by sales  
staff in attendance. Examples include watches and jewellery, spe-  
cialist stores, trade counters, delicatessens, food counters.  
*Self-selection*  
In this method, customers handle, compare and select merchandise  
prior to taking them to a point of sale for payment, for example in  
a department store.  
*Self-service*  
In this method, groceries and durables are collected in baskets  
or trolleys and taken to the point of sale for payment. Examples  
include supermarkets and discount stores.  
*Assisted service*  
This involves personal service or self-selection combined with the  
dispatch of goods from stockroom or warehouse for collection or  
home delivery. Examples include white goods stores and furniture  
stores.  
*Fulfilment by store*  
In this click and collect service, merchandise is ordered and paid  
for in advance and collected in store. Examples include department  
stores, home & DIY stores.  
# 2.5 Retail operations  
*Small independent*  
Owner-operated stores with no headquarters or centralised man-  
agement, and usually comprising no more than three separate stores  
or retail outlets. *Large independent*  
Privately owned retail business, but with centralised management  
or under the control of a head office. Usually comprising up to ten  
stores, but can be considerably larger.  
*Multiple*  
Usually publicly-quoted companies under the management of a  
board of directors. Usually comprising ten or more stores and often  
with a nationwide or global presence. These often sell their own  
branded merchandise.  
*Concessions*  
These are retail businesses granted the right to trade from within a  
larger retail operation such as a department store or mall concourse  
in consideration of rent, fees or a percentage of profit.  
*Franchises*  
The brand’s trademark, store design, sales methodology and mer-  
chandise are established by the franchisor, who receives a fee and  
royalties from a franchisee who trades under the brand’s name and  
identity.  
# 2.6 Calculating retail areas  
• Gross leasable area \(GLA\)\: the total area of all floors capable  
of being occupied for exclusive use, excluding public areas,  
lift shafts, service risers but may include shared areas such as  
WC cores. GLA is measured to the inside finished surface of  
the outside walls \(including storefronts\) and to the centreline of  
dividing partitions.  
• Net sales area \(NSA\)\: the total area within the store to which the  
public has access or from where sales are made. This includes  
display windows, other display areas, fitting rooms, serving coun-  
ters, point of sale desks and the areas behind used by serving staff.  
NSA is used to calculate a store’s turnover density \(sales per m²\).  
• In Terms of Zone A \(ITZA\)\: this is a method for calculating the  
rental value of a retail property that acknowledges the higher worth  
of floor space adjacent to the display window where merchandise  
will be more easily seen by passing customers. The floor plan is  
divided into zones, each with a depth of 20 feet \(6.1 m\) with Zone  
A nearest the storefront valued at the highest rate. Zone B is valued  
at half the value of the Zone A, Zone C is valued at half of Zone  
B, and so on. This form of valuation usually applies only to the  
ground floor. For other areas of the store, or space beyond Zone  
D, a generic rate is applied. An example is shown in Figure 34.1.  
# D  
# C  
# B  
# A  
6.1m 6.1m 6.1m 3m  
10m \(Example\)  
**ZONE A \(£1000/m2/pa\)**  
10 X 6.1 = 61m2  
Value = £61,000/pa  
**ZONE B \(£500/m2/pa\)**  
10 X 6.1 = 61m2  
Value = £30,500/pa  
**ZONE C \(£250/m2/pa\)**  
10 X 6.1 = 61m2  
Value = £15,250/pa  
**ZONE D - Remaining \(£125/m2/pa\)**  
10 X 3 = 30m2  
Value = £3,750/pa  
# Total rental value = £110,500/pa

# 3 ELEMENTS OF RETAIL  
# 3.1 Store planning  
The layout of the store should meet the needs of the retailer’s oper-  
ational requirements while presenting the sales area to customers in  
an enticing and attractive way. The design of the sales area should  
be informed by a clear understanding of the range of merchandise  
offered, and the assortment and the volume of product on display.  
Typically, lower densities of merchandising reflect a higher price  
point. Retailers and store designers often plan the sales area lay-  
out in terms of the customer journey, with carefully structured  
space planning and merchandising to entice customers into making  
impulse purchases. The sales area layout is also a reflection of cus-  
tomer service offered, from the formality of counter service to the  
more relaxed open plan arrangement of self-selection.  
The entrance is usually less densely merchandised to allow cus-  
tomers time and space to make the adjustment between the public  
realm and the sales area. Retailers recognise the importance of  
making the entrance inviting to potential customers, for example  
through the deployment of staff to greet the customer.  
In all but the smallest and simplest of stores, there is a hierarchy  
of aisle widths, reflecting both the foot traffic and the degree of inti-  
macy desired by the retailer. Staircases, escalators and lifts should  
be readily identifiable in the sales space, as travelling to other floors  
is usually a disincentive to browsing. In a small store, the location  
of the point of sale counter is often determined by security consid-  
erations, with good visibility to all parts of the sales area important.  
In larger stores, point of sales counters or checkouts are located to  
suit customer flow or to drive foot traffic in the store.  
# 3.2 Operational and ancillary space  
*Stock rooms*  
These are the areas of the store that support the delivery, handling  
and temporary storage of merchandise prior to its sale. Where  
stock is held on shelves or hanging rails, stock room capacity can  
be increased using rolling racking. Stock rooms should be located  
in close proximity to loading bays and delivery points. If sales staff  
must frequently access the stock room – for example for the sale of  
shoes – good access routes between the stock room and the sales  
floor are essential.  
*Staff welfare*  
Facilities to be provided for the use of staff include toilets, chang-  
ing rooms with lockers, break room and tea kitchen. The scope of  
welfare facilities reflects the size of the store, the nature of the retail  
business and the number of staff employed.  
# 3.3 Ratio of ancillary space  
The proportions of NSA \(also referred to as front of house\) and the  
store’s ancillary space \(also referred to as back of house\) will vary  
according to the type of retail being transacted, Table II. The size  
of stockroom will also be affected by the speed and volume of sales  
and the frequency of stock replenishment. Where a retailer is trad-  
ing as a concession in a department store, or from a mall unit, some  
ancillary space such as staff welfare facilities might be remote from

the sales area and shared with others, and these factors will also  
affect the ratio of net sales to ancillary space areas.  
*Painted*  
This traditional sign-writing signage is applied directly to the fas-  
cia. The sign may require a light source directed on the sign in  
hours of darkness.  
# 3.4 Display windows  
Retailers are more dependent on attracting passing trade than  
other businesses. A store’s display windows are therefore an  
important element in how the store presents itself to potential  
customers. Because retail display windows contribute much to  
the vibrancy of the traditional street, there may be a town plan-  
ning requirement to maintain display windows, for example in  
conservation areas.  
Following are the three main types of display windows, as  
shown in Figure 34.2.  
*Open windows*  
There is no physical or visual separation between the window dis-  
play and the store’s sales area, although the visual merchandising  
area of the window may be differentiated by a change of level or  
dwarf wall.  
*Enclosed windows*  
The window is separated from the sales area by a partition. On a  
long store front, such as those encountered in department stores,  
the windows may be connected or separated with cross walls.  
The separating wall acts as a backdrop to the window’s visual  
merchandising and should be designed to be readily decorated  
or re-finished to suit the display. Safe access for visual mer-  
chandisers, their tools and installations are a requirement in the  
design.  
*Vitrine windows*  
Where the window is intended to display small or high-value  
pieces such as watches and jewellery, a smaller vitrine with the  
emphasis on a single piece of merchandise is appropriate. These  
should be mounted at a suitable viewing height. Because of the  
value of the merchandise displayed in vitrines, there may be  
additional security measures to be considered such as anti-bandit  
display glass.  
*Pin mounted*  
The letters or logos representing the brand are mounted on pins  
so that they stand out from the fascia. These can be lit from  
light sources concealed by the lettering, so that a halo effect is  
created.  
*Edge lit*  
The letters or logos representing the brand are mounted on acrylic  
sheet, which is lit from light sources concealed by the lettering. The  
light is reflected through the acrylic to create an illuminated edge  
giving a halo effect.  
*Back lit*  
The letters are formed as individual light boxes and finished with  
a semi-opaque material cut to the shape of the individual signage  
characters. The sign therefore comprises illuminated letters against  
a dark background.  
*Lightbox*  
A single lightbox is mounted on the fascia, which is finished with a  
signage panel in a semi-opaque material. The whole fascia can be  
backlit, or areas can be blanked off as unlit.  
Fascia signage is best viewed face-on, and so additional project-  
ing signage may be required if the store is to be seen by potential  
customers approaching from the side, Figure 34.4. The main types  
are described as follows\:  
# 3.5 Signage  
The primary location for the store’s name or brand name is the  
storefront fascia. The signage may be illuminated or backlit,  
although the extent and brightness of the illumination might be  
limited by statutory authorities. Following are the main types of  
signage, as shown in Figure 34.3.  
*Monolithic signage*  
Free-standing backlit structures in the form of totem signage.  
Usually of substantial size \(minimum 1.5 m² face area\), double  
sided and deployed externally. These are typically found in retail  
parks.  
*Flags and banners*  
Roof top flags on vertical flag poles are usually only adopted on  
large buildings where the flag can be seen from a distance. It is  
more usual to have a flag mounted on the façade of the store at a  
lower level, either on a horizontal flagpole or one that projects at  
45 degrees. The later requires a quadrilateral flag to hang to best  
effect.

**34.2** *Display windows types* Painted Pin mounted Edge lit  
**34.3** *Fascia signage types*  
# Hanging board Blade sign  
**34.4** *Projecting signage types*  
*Hanging signs*  
These are hung from a wall-mounted bracket, often with the addi-  
tion of picture lights to illuminate the sign during the hours of  
darkness.  
*Blade signs*  
These are projecting signs that cantilever from the façade.  
Illumination options are similar to the back lit and edge lit fascia  
signage types.  
# 3.6 Wayfinding  
Wayfinding is an important consideration to assist customer navi-  
gation within large stores, department stores and shopping centres.  
Wayfinding includes directional signage to indicate the locations  
of store departments, toilets and other customer services. Store  
guides, maps and information points are located at key points such  
as entrances and lifts, at the end of escalators and, in the case of  
malls, the junctions of major branches or walkways.  
# 3.7 Shop fittings  
Shop fittings are pieces of furniture designed for the display of  
merchandise within the store. These must be selected to reflect the  
nature of the retail business, for example, the use of hanging rails  
for garments, or shelves for accessories. Consideration must also be  
# Retail shops and stores 34-5  
Back lit Lightbox  
# Flag Banner  
given to the capacity and density of merchandise to be displayed,  
and the ergonomics of customer selection, Figure 34.5.  
Shop fittings may be manufactured to a bespoke design or  
selected from standard modular units. Whichever method is  
used, the display furniture should be stable, safe from collapse  
or fall, durable and designed to display merchandise to best  
effect.  
Display furniture can be broadly divided into perimeter,  
Figure 34.6, and mid-floor, Figure 34.7. Perimeter furniture is  
designed to be seen from one side while mid-floor is designed to  
be seen in the round.  
Perimeter display can be free-standing or incorporated into wall  
niches. Examples include\:  
• Hanging rails  
• Shelves \(illuminated and non-illuminated\)  
• Cupboards.  
Mid-floor or free-standing units include\:  
• Hanging rail \(mobile\)  
• Shelves  
• Gondolas and island displays  
• Cases and cupboards. **34-6 Retail shops and stores**

# 3.8 Other display  
The display fittings illustrated in section 3.7 allow customer selec-  
tion. Other fittings are intended solely for the display and promotion  
of merchandise and include mannequins, display graphics, screens  
and art pieces. These fittings support the visual merchandising of  
the store.  
# 3.9 Point of sale \(POS\)  
The point of sale usually takes the form of a cash desk or check out,  
although mobile POS using a hand-held device, brought to the cus-  
tomer is increasingly common. Advances in technologies deployed  
by some retailers now allow ‘just walk out’ sales where the store’s  
systems identify a customer and what they purchased, with the cus-  
tomer’s account debited accordingly. Small stores with very low  
sales volumes can process sales through a single till unit. But it  
is more usual, particularly in larger stores, that the cash drawer,  
monitor, printer and processor are separate devices, Figure 34.8.  
# 3.10 Fitting rooms  
Where garments are sold, fitting rooms are required to allow the  
customer to try on clothes for size and fit. In large stores, access to  
fitting rooms is usually managed from a single point where rejected  
clothes are returned to staff who return them to the sales floor.  
Simple fitting rooms may comprise little more than a privacy cur-  
tain and a garment hook, Figure 34.9. Larger fitting rooms, usually  
found where price points and customer service levels are higher,  
include seating, improved lighting and multiple mirrors. An acces-  
sible fitting room suitable for a wheelchair user is shown in Figure  
34.10.  
# 3.11 Security  
Display merchandise is vulnerable to theft or ‘shrinkage’ if meas-  
ures are not taken to prevent or discourage stock loss.  
*Space planning*  
The layout of fixtures in a store can determine how vulnerable  
merchandise is to theft. Avoiding concealed areas of display and  
allowing good sight lines for sales staff to oversee the sales floor  
serve to discourage theft.  
*Electronic article surveillance*  
This is the identification of merchandise that has been tagged and  
is detectable at certain points in the store, usually the entrance area.  
Detectors are located in gates, embedded in the floor or ceiling or a  
combination of all of these. Radio antennae in the detectors register  
the tag when it passes across their field of detection. Hard tags,

using acousto-magnetic frequencies, are removed at the POS and  
are reusable. Radio-frequency tags operating in a wider frequency  
band use flat printed disposable tags that are deactivated at the  
POS. Other tagging methods include ink tags requiring a special  
device for removal. If the tag is forcibly removed, glass vials con-  
taining permanent ink break, spoiling the garment and rendering it  
valueless.  
*Physical security*  
Display windows that are vulnerable to attack can be protected  
with shutters, either closing over the external face of the win-  
dow, or located internally and incorporated into the design of  
the display window. In this case, a brick bond pattern of shutter  
links allows some visibility of the window display when the store  
is closed.  
*Fog systems*  
These can be deployed in the event of a robbery. The system com-  
prises a heated liquid ejected under pressure that vaporises and  
expands as a fog, thereby reducing visibility to hinder the perpe-  
trators.  
*Back of house security*  
These measures include access control locks to rear doors, CCTV  
and in larger stores, security personnel deployed to monitor and  
control access.  
# 3.12 People counters  
The simplest form of people counters are devices that track the  
number of people passing a fixed point in a store, such as the  
entrance threshold. The resulting data provides basic information  
on footfall and customer movement. A variety of technologies may  
be used to track movement.  
*Stereo video cameras*  
The images from two cameras are compared, and from these an  
algorithm determines the presence of a person passing.  
*Thermal*  
passing.  
This device detects body heat to determine the presence of a person  
*Wi-Fi*  
This system detects the presence of any person carrying a Wi-Fi-  
enabled smartphone.  
*CCTV analytics*  
Using existing security camera systems, artificial intelligence is  
used to interpret video feed, not only to determine the presence of  
a customer but to also calculate their age, gender and movement  
patterns through the store.  
# 3.13 Building services  
Because the majority of retail space is internal with limited  
opportunities to benefit from natural light and ventilation, stores  
rely heavily on mechanical ventilation, air conditioning and  
artificial lighting. The design of these systems requires careful  
coordination with the interior fit-out to ensure that they function  
effectively without a disproportionate effect on the store’s aes-  
thetic.  
*Environmental control*  
Retail premises vary widely in form and function but share the  
requirement to create a comfortable environment in which to shop  
and work. Issues to be considered are the risk of heat gain from  
potentially high occupancy levels, UV light damage to merchan-  
dise in display windows, solar gain through large areas of glazing  
and heat gains from lighting and display screens. While small  
stores can rely on natural ventilation and simple heating systems,  
larger stores utilise mechanical cooling and heating systems in  
combination with fresh air supply and extract. These are typically  
refrigerant heat pump systems or self-contained evaporator fan  
coil systems. Typical temperatures for different areas are shown  
in Table III. **34-10 Retail shops and stores**

*Supermarkets*  
Large supermarkets contain a wide variety of display types from  
non-food household goods to groceries, chilled and frozen foods.  
Large circulation areas and non-food aisles may require minimal  
heating, whereas entrance areas, checkouts and aisles of chilled and  
frozen cabinets may require specific environmental control. These  
varying requirements can be met through zoned or independent  
air handling plant dedicated to specific areas. Chilled cabinets are  
typically served through remote refrigeration served by central  
compressor plant and external condensers. Ducted air handling sys-  
tems are typically utilised, possibly supplemented by the retrieval  
of cold air from refrigerated display. Temperature requirements for  
different foods are shown in Table IV.

*Lighting*  
Advances in LED lighting technology mean that other lamp types  
are now rarely specified. Lighting is generally designed with con-  
sideration to ambient or background lighting, accent lighting to  
support the display of merchandise and task lighting to address  
functional needs. Lighting levels are shown in Table V.

# 3.14 Spatial requirements  
While it is possible to establish a retail operation from a very small  
footprint such as a stall or a kiosk, the majority of stores are larger and  
found in the locations described in 2.3. The nature of these locations  
tends to impose their own structural and dimension constraints on the  
store. For example, the width of stores occupying the ground floors  
of high street sites is governed by the dimension between party walls  
of adjacent properties, whereas the structural grid adopted for larger,  
modern developments is determined by the efficiency and economy  
of the structural design without necessarily placing the retailer’s needs  
foremost. Structural and spatial requirements are set out in Table VI.  
# Table VI Structural and spatial requirements  
# Structural grid Width \(m\) Notes  
High street stores 4.0 to 6.0 Determined by party walls. Narrow

# 4 MARKETS  
# 4.1 Introduction  
The rights granted to municipalities to hold markets date back cen-  
turies and allows control over market trading within a radius of six  
and two-thirds miles \(10.73 km\). Markets are traditionally simple  
but vibrant environments where social interaction is as important as  
the sales made. There are approximately 1000 traditional markets  
in the UK supporting long-standing traders as well as those new to  
retailing who wish to take a low-cost, first step in the world of retail.  
# 4.2 Open markets  
Market stalls might be erected immediately prior to trading or set  
up in a semi-permanent arrangement. The latter is more common  
where a dedicated market square exists. Stalls may be supple-  
mented with fitted-out vans and trailers, Figure 34.11. Where stalls  
are erected on the day of trade, pitches are usually demarcated by  
kerb or pavement markings. Key considerations are\:  
• Vehicle parking and loading \(near stalls\)  
• Traffic control  
• Electrical and water supply to support food vendors  
• Washing facilities  
• Protection and temperature control of fresh food  
• Waste management and street cleaning. Pitch width 3000mm

# 4.3 Covered markets  
Located in market halls and comprising more permanent stalls,  
booths and kiosks. Covered markets offer a similar range of  
merchandise to open markets but may specialise, for example as  
farmers’ markets or craft and antique markets.  
# 4.4 Market halls  
Market halls are usually designed as large-span single-storey buildings  
with good natural light and ventilation. The preferred configuration is a  
single ground floor with good street access, Figure 34.12. Upper floors  
are usually limited to perimeter balcony space served by escalators,  
stairs, goods and accessible lifts. Fish, meat and food stalls are grouped  
in zones with more sophisticated ventilation, drainage and services.  
Key considerations include access to common service areas  
including remote storage, loading and delivery bays. Shared waste  
disposal facilities including the sorting of waste, recycling and com-  
paction. The fire strategy must account for a variety of traders and  
merchandise type, and potentially densely populated common areas.  
# 5 SMALL STORES  
# 5.1 Definition  
It is not sufficient to classify small stores on the basis of floor area  
alone, as they are generally associated with being independent  
stores. The Experian GOAD retail data service defines an ‘inde-  
pendent outlet’ as one with fewer than ten units. The Greater  
London Authority uses this definition, along with a maximum gross  
floor area of 80 m² in their definition of small stores for research  
and planning purposes. For the purposes of fire safety, *The Building*  
*Regulations Approved Document B, Buildings other than dwellings*  
defines a small store as having a maximum of two storeys plus a  
basement and with no single storey greater in area than 280 m².  
# 5.2 Types  
*Convenience*  
These are located in densely populated areas and transport loca-  
tions such as service stations, railway stations and airports.  
# Retail shops and stores 34-11

Pitch width 8000mm to 9000mm  
*Variety*  
These stores specialise in a chosen category of retail. Stores may  
be located to be close to similar retail operations, or in a particular  
catchment area.  
*Services*  
Typically financial and professional services, these usually have a  
high percentage of office use.  
# 5.3 Store locations  
*High street stores*  
These typically occupy ground and basement floors with another  
use above, such as office or residential.  
*Mall and shopping centre stores*  
These stores are typically single storey with one open-fronted side.  
Back of house access may be from a central service corridor with  
direct links to a common loading bay area.  
*Transport retail*  
These usually occupy a small footprint. Transport hub stores offer  
convenience products \(railway stations\) through to luxury goods  
\(airports\). In airside locations, airport fire regulations may impose  
requirements for fire resistance and smoke control. Stock rooms are  
generally remote due to airside space constraints.  
*Miscellaneous*  
Because of their size and variety of offer, small stores can be found  
throughout the retail world, incorporated into a variety location  
such as visitor centres, academic institutions and hospitals.  
# 5.4 Store space planning  
The majority of small stores can be characterised by their single  
entrance and adjacent display windows. The POS counter is located  
in a position that allows oversight of the retail area. This ensures  
good sales staff visibility and acts as a deterrent to theft. The stock-  
room and other ancillary areas are located to the rear of the store. **34-12 Retail shops and stores**

# 6 DEPARTMENT STORES  
# 6.1 General  
Department stores are large complex stores, extending over sev-  
eral floors and often in landmark buildings in the towns or cities  
where they are located, Figure 34.13. Newer department store sites  
also occupy malls and shopping centres where they act as one of  
the development’s anchor stores, Figure 34.14. Department stores  
sell a wide variety of merchandise, although the primary offer is  
usually clothes, shoes and accessories. Other significant elements  
of a department store’s retail offer include watches and jewellery,  
homewares and household electrical, sporting goods, children’s  
toys, books, stationery, furniture and food and beverages in the  
form of a food hall.  
Department stores vary considerably in size, the largest UK  
stores being Harrods, London \(100000 m² of sales area\) and  
Selfridges, London \(50000 m² sales area\). Most department stores  
offering a reasonably wide range of product have a sales area of  
between 20000 to 50000 m². ‘Junior’ department stores, special-  
ising in luxury goods and fashion have around 5000 to 10000 m²  
sales area.  
# 6.2 Spatial organisation  
A long street frontage is preferred for multiple display windows  
and customer entrances. Because of the large numbers of staff  
employed, a separate staff entrance, changing and locker room  
facilities are provided. A loading bay is required to receive mer-  
chandise of a variety of types, as well as facilities to dispatch **Retail shops and stores 34-13**

deliveries and to collect and sort waste for disposal. Some loading  
bays may be equipped with dock levellers. Where the store’s offer  
includes a food hall, temperature-controlled stock rooms covering  
ambient, chilled and frozen zones are required. In order to manage  
the large amounts of stock held off the retail floor, central stock  
rooms are caged to allow a sub-division of lockable storage. Not all  
stock is located remotely as this is impractical for some merchan-  
dise such as shoes where stock must be quickly available.  
Within the department store, customer footfall varies widely and  
this has traditionally led to high value, high turnover departments such  
as accessories, cosmetics, watches and jewellery being located on the  
ground floor. These departments also benefit from higher ground floor  
ceiling heights. Other typical adjacencies are the food hall located on  
the ground floor or basement, which facilitates servicing and customer  
convenience. Cafes and restaurants may be located on the uppermost  
floor to benefit from city views and drive customer traffic. To encour-  
age customers to visit upper floors, escalators should be sited where  
they are easily located. Directional signage should ensure that nav-  
igation between departments is as clear as possible, and customer  
wayfinding can be supported by good sightlines across departments.  
A clear hierarchy of aisle widths and windows with external views  
also contribute to customer orientation and wayfinding.  
# 6.3 Fire compartmentation  
Maximum sales floor compartments are limited in area to 2,000 m²  
\(*Building Regulations Approved Document B*\), rising to 4,000 m²  
if an automatic sprinkler system is installed. Stock rooms must be  
compartmented if they negatively affect the means of escape, but  
this requirement may be relaxed for stock rooms fitted with either  
automatic fire detection and alarms or with an automatic sprin-  
kler system. Department store floors are characteristically linked  
by escalators in atria. As this increases the risk of fire and smoke  
spread between floors, measures to limit this, such as smoke cur-  
tains and fire shutters, may be required.  
# 6.4 Retail characteristics  
The department store is not simply the collection of separate  
departments in a single building. Department stores seek to offer  
a range of products and services across a wide spectrum of price  
4  
3  
points, blending external brands with the store’s own-bought or  
own-brand offers. Successful department stores are able to host  
external brands without losing their own character and identity.  
# 6.5 Concessions  
External brands that occupy sites within the department store  
are called concessions. The spaces occupied by them might be  
a single counter or corner of a sales floor, through to larger and  
more sophisticated ‘store-in-stores’ with their own interior iden-  
tity. Where groups of brands occupy these spaces \(typically 20 to  
200 m²\), the department store sets design guidelines to ensure a  
harmonious overall design that is in accord with the ambition of the  
department store for the sales room in question.  
# 7 SUPERMARKETS  
# 7.1 General  
Supermarkets primary retail offer is food and household necessities  
from self-service lines. Full-service supermarkets, often located on city  
fringes or out-of-town sites range from 2500 to 8000 m² sales area but  
in recent years supermarket operators have sought to expand through  
smaller, urban ‘express’ stores of 200 to 500 m² gross floor area. These  
offer a smaller product range based on convenience purchases and  
without the necessity for trolleys or pass-through checkouts.  
# 7.2 Planning  
Sales are invariably on one floor and are planned to allow trolley cir-  
culation from car park through the store. A simple rectangular plan  
is preferred with a 30 to 60 m frontage. The position and layout of  
the checkouts govern entrance, exit and circulation plans. Sales areas  
have large unobstructed spaces with structural grids of 9.0 m or more  
to suit display stand spacing and a minimum of 3.5 m clear ceiling  
height, although ceilings are typically open with exposed services.  
In larger stores, delivery and waste disposal is kept apart from cus-  
tomer traffic with loading bays at the rear of the store in a secure  
compound. Express stores may not have this facility and are serviced  
from the street outside of the busiest trading hours. Typical plans for  
full-service and express stores are shown in Figure 34.15.

# 7.3 Layout  
A standard arrangement of parallel shelf racks and cabinets on each  
side of circulation aisles is commonly adopted. In larger stores, the  
main aisles are 2.2 to 2.5 m wide increasing to 2.8 to 3.2 m in front  
of delicatessen counters and fresh meat and fish cabinets. At aisle  
ends, a width of 3.0 m is provided to allow for turning trolleys. At  
the checkout line, a clear width of 2.2 to 3.0 m is allowed either side  
of the checkout. In express stores where trolleys are not available,  
narrower aisles are possible, typically 1.2 to 1.8 m in width.  
Displays are grouped into food, non-food and alcoholic bever-  
ages sections. The delicatessen, bakery and perishables prepared on  
the premises need to be located adjacent to their preparation areas,  
with easy access to store’s refrigerated stores. Refrigerated display  
cabinets are grouped together to facilitate service connections and  
heat recovery. Demand goods \(vegetables, fruit\) are usually placed  
near the entrance to initiate buying, with promotional items dis-  
played in bins and in racks at the end of rows and checkout stations.  
Larger supermarkets may offer customer toilets, baby changing  
facilities and a separate click and collect counter.  
Space has to be allocated for customers to collect and restore bas-  
kets, Figure 34.16 and trolleys, Figure 34.17. Where the majority of

customers arrive by car, trolley parks are normally situated within  
the car parking area, often in covered kiosks and few \(if any\) baskets  
are provided. In express stores, only baskets will be made available.  
Typical checkouts rely on a member of staff scanning items that  
have been presented by the customer who then bags their purchases  
and pays, Figure 34.18. Smaller self-service tills, generally used for  
purchases of a few items only, are customer operated, Figure 34.19.  
These are usually placed in blocks to allow staff oversight. Self-  
scanning technology allowing the customer to scan and pack their  
purchases as they shop is also being introduced by some supermar-  
ket retailers.  
Within larger supermarkets, some sales areas might exist inde-  
pendently of the checkout system, for example a pharmacy, florist  
or café.  
# 8 RETAIL PARKS AND LARGE FORMAT STORES  
# 8.1 Retail parks  
These are developments of at least 4500 m² located on city fringes  
or out-of-town locations, comprising of at least three, single-storey  
units of at least 900 m². In the United Kingdom, there are over  
1200 out-of-town retail parks and so their influence on consumers’  
shopping habits is significant. More substantial retail parks may  
contain large format stores or superstores. These are considerably  
larger, offering 5000 to 10000 m² of selling space, with the requi-  
site increase in car parking and site area.  
Retail parks predominately cover the sales of non-food goods  
such as DIY, furniture, furnishings and consumer durables.  
Buildings are generally of warehouse design, and benefit from the  
combined attraction, shared infrastructure, car parking and supple-  
mentary facilities such as family dining restaurants or fast-food  
outlets. Retail units are simple in form with design emphasis placed **34-16 Retail shops and stores**

# 8.2 Outlet centres  
Retail parks comprising stores offering imperfect or excess stock  
at discounted prices are known as outlet centres, Figure 34.20. The  
retail offer is primarily apparel, accessories, homewares and luxury  
goods. The largest out-of-town outlet centres also include food and  
2

beverage offers. Typically, retail units range from 100 to 1200 m²  
sales area with a maximum of two storeys.  
# 8.2 Planning  
Large format stores are constructed as rectangular boxes having  
large-span clearances to allow mainly one-level trading. If required,  
upper storeys are confined to part of the building and used for non-  
food sales, and ancillary services. Compared with supermarkets,

# 9 SHOPPING CENTRES  
# 9.1 Types  
Shopping centres operate under one central management, ensur-  
ing a high degree of overall control. The centre management lease  
retail units to individual retailers and ensure that the store fit-outs  
are carried out to a prescribed standard. As well as ensuring that  
the centre offers a suitable and attractive range of retail offers, the  
centre management are also responsible for the maintenance of  
common areas, security and promotion of the centre.  
Shopping centres are pedestrian spaces and may be\:  
• Open in terraces, squares, piazzas or village-style groupings  
• Partially covered, with canopies, arcades or set-backs  
• Fully covered malls on single or multiple levels.  
# 9.2 Locations  
In the United Kingdom, the development of city shopping centres  
has been driven by urban redevelopment projects, often leading to  
significant schemes of over 20,000 m² located within the existing  
fabric of the city. These include enclosed, stand-alone develop-  
ments such as Westfield Stratford City \(175,000 m² GLA\) as well  
as semi-enclosed centres more closely embedded in the existing  
street pattern such as Trinity Leeds \(72,245 m² GLA\), Figure  
34.21\. These shopping centres are well connected to existing  
adjacent retail sites, car parks and transport infrastructure.

# 9.3 Regional centres  
While town planning policies since the mid-1990s have halted the  
development of new regional out-of-town centres, existing sites  
continue to be redeveloped and improved with major regional cen-  
tres offering sales areas well in excess of 100,000 m². Out-of-town  
malls are located close to major road junctions and include exten-  
sive areas of car parking as well as transport hubs such as local  
bus stations. There are currently 19 regional centres in the United  
Kingdom offering almost 3.9 million m² of retail space. The largest  
are the Metrocentre, Gateshead \(194,000 m² GLA including retail  
park\), Bluewater, Dartford \(155,700 m² GLA\), Westfield, Dudley  
\(154,002 m² GLA\).  
At the time of their development, planning policy encouraged  
the redevelopment of brownfield sites, including exhausted mineral  
workings and discontinued industrial wasteland. Development of  
these sites places extensive demands on technical infrastructures  
and require conservation provisions. These include rainwater recy-  
cling, combined heat and power systems, energy balancing, airflow  
control, fabric insulation and shading, management control sys-  
tems and planned maintenance.  
# 9.4 Planning  
Where practicable, urban shopping centres follow existing street  
patterns and are sensitively integrated into the existing street pat-  
tern and its architecture.  
Commercial and operational considerations include\:  
• Number, size and locations of major stores or anchor tenants  
which will increase the centre’s attractiveness and improve cus-  
tomer footfall  
• Distribution of small stores throughout the centre including an  
attractive mix of independent and brand retailers  
• Entrances and links with parking, public transport and adjacent  
shopping areas  
• Number of levels, changes of level and ease of vertical circulation  
• Leisure attractions such as cinemas, restaurants and entertainment  
venues to draw visitors to the centre  
• Servicing needs and access for deliveries and the removal of waste  
• Environmental control in the mall and in individual stores  
• Fire separation, evacuation and life safety.  
# 9.5 Plan forms  
Typical retail units are single storey of 100 to 1200 m². However,  
larger brand retailers and anchor stores may occupy two storey  
sites with access from both levels of the centre. Malls are usually  
limited to two sales floors because of the difficulty in driving foot-  
fall to the furthest locations, but exceptions exist, notably the three  
floors of retail at Westfield Stratford City.  
Centres are usually planned so that the anchor stores are located  
at the ends of malls or the end of a branch. Anchor stores attracting  
footfall have an effective range of 90 to 120 m. It is not practical  
to extend a mall more than 350 m and large developments call for  
more than one level with concentrated plan forms. These include  
L-form, T-form, pinwheel, figure of eight, loop and other variants,  
Figure 34.22  
# 9.6 Details  
The width of circulation areas in shopping centres varies widely.  
Urban shopping centres, particularly open or semi-enclosed devel-  
opments based on existing street patterns, may include both open  
plazas and narrow corridors of retail units. Face-to-face dimensions  
between stores of 5.4 m upwards are considered suitable to allow  
good pedestrian circulation and visibility of window display. The  
width of circulation routes in enclosed malls has developed over  
time, with most developers working to a rule of thumb dimen-  
sion of 9.13 m \(based on the 30’ width of North American malls\).  
Over the years however, this standard has become less rigid as  
mall planning has evolved from a simple linear plan form to more  
imaginative layouts. This 9.13 m width \(or wider\) allows kiosks,  
seating and other attractions to be located mid-floor in the walk-  
way. Upper galleries around a central court or atrium are typically  
4m wide.  
The preferred display window frontage for small stores is  
5.4 m to 7.3 m with a minimum height of 2.5 m. In open or  
semi-enclosed centres, storefronts are usually similar to high  
street store types, although likely to be designed in compliance  
with centre management guidelines. In enclosed malls, glazed  
storefronts are necessary when the mall remains open to the pub-  
lic at night but otherwise fully or partly open frontages are more  
convenient with shutters or fire barriers \(if required\) to secure  
the store overnight. **Retail shops and stores 34-19**

# 9.7 Food courts  
In malls, large atria and glazed courtyards provide activity spaces  
which are often landscaped and used for restaurants gathered  
around a food court. Features such as water fountains, kiosks,  
planted containers and children’s play centres also create focuses  
for interest.  
# 9.8 Fire precautions  
It is challenging to design large shopping centres on the basis of  
conventional compartmentation and prescriptive regulations.  
Fire safety is therefore usually addressed through bespoke or  
engineered methods. These methods model the behaviour of  
fire and smoke to calculate safe occupancy levels, egress routes  
and evacuation times. Malls must be of non-combustible con-  
struction, with incidental combustible material controlled, and  
have an automatic sprinkler system, detection and fire alarms  
installed. Fire separating walls are required between individ-  
ual retail units and between retail units and internal service  
corridors.  
Smoke control is managed through smoke reservoirs, created  
by downstand beams on fascias at shop frontages and at inter-  
vals along the mall. Smoke detectors activate exhaust fans in the  
reservoirs, and lower level fresh air supply ensures clear escape  
routes.  
Maximum occupancy levels are estimated on the basis of\:  
• Stores, showrooms, supplementary areas – 7.0 m²/person  
• Supermarkets, department store sales floors – 2.0 m²/person.  
No more than 50 per cent of occupants should be assumed to  
escape through the rear of a store, with the rest using the mall.  
Escape routes from the mall must be provided at intervals, with  
exits to open streets directly or via separated structures. Specific  
provision for fire brigade appliances must be made at larger cen-  
tres, with access to hydrants, hoses and extinguishers forming part  
of the fire strategy.  
# 9.9 Circulation and access  
Vertical circulation between storeys requires escalators, feature  
lifts and staircases designed to stimulate interest. These are usually  
located in a spacious central concourse or atrium, at junctions or  
corners and within the larger stores.  
For servicing retail units, vehicular access is required to loading  
docks and waiting bays directly accessible to each of the larger  
stores, with service roads, goods lifts and tunnels extending to the  
rear of smaller units. Service entry is usually at basement or street  
level but may be at an upper level on sloping sites.  
# 9.10 Engineering services  
The shopping centre’s landord is normally responsible for install-  
ing and providing the communal services of the mall, including  
comfort cooling, heating, lighting, cleaning, fire control and secu-  
rity systems. As a rule, individual tenants install remaining plant  
and equipment within their own store to meet their own needs and  
subject to proprietor agreement. Food-preparation areas, public toi-  
lets and plant areas require the installation of specific ventilation,  
drainage and electrical services, and these are installed and main-  
tained by the landlord or mall operator.

11 Bibliography  
The national curriculum applies to pupils of compulsory school  
age in community and foundation schools, including community  
special schools and foundation special schools, and voluntary aided  
and voluntary controlled schools. It sets out a series of statutory  
requirements and is organised on the basis of four Key Stages\:  
• Key Stage 1\: Ages 5–7 \(Years 1–2\)  
• Key Stage 2\: Ages 7–11 \(Years 3–6\)  
• Key Stage 3\: Ages 11–14 \(Years 7–9\)  
• Key Stage 4\: Ages 14–16 \(Years 10–11\).  
Developed in a series of Key Stages, the Primary Curriculum  
KS1 and 2 is based upon a wide breadth of learning as well as  
developing key skills in literacy, numeracy and information and  
communications technology \(ICT\). At these early stages of a child’s  
development, emphasis is placed on social and emotional develop-  
ment along with key personal and thinking skills, while engaging  
children in learning through play and activity-based learning.  
The Secondary Curriculum seeks to provide a cohesive struc-  
ture for learning from ages 11–19 years \(KS 3, 4 and 5\). These  
build on the experiences of children in primary school to help stu-  
dents achieve high standards and develop personal, learning and  
thinking skills. More recently, the government has introduced the  
concept of the English Baccalaureate. This is a grouping of subject  
areas rather than a formal qualification in its own right.  
# 1.3 Role of Ofsted  
Ofsted is the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services  
and Skills. Ofsted was set up under the Education and Inspections  
Act by the government to regulate and inspect and to help achieve  
excellence in the care of children and young people. As part of its  
role, Ofsted inspects schools and produces reports into its findings  
using a set framework of criteria on a range of subjects from the  
safety of the environment that the school provides to the quality  
of teaching and learning in individual lessons. Parents will often  
use the Ofsted reports when choosing a school for their child. See  
www.ofsted.gov.uk.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
This chapter specifically relates to the design of schools in England  
and Wales at the time of writing. In other parts of the UK, design  
standards and education delivery varies.  
# 1.1 Sector changes  
Since the late 2000s, school design development has increased  
significantly as development of curriculum and education delivery  
methods along with major programmes of school renewal have  
driven the education design debate.  
Education is at the fulcrum of social and economic renewal.  
Transforming education delivery and engaging students in new ways  
of learning is seen as key to raising education standards and prepar-  
ing young people to meet future challenges. Curriculum delivery has  
changed to develop a wider engagement in education, and greater  
emphasis is given to vocational subjects and student subject choice.  
There have been several key recent changes. The DfE \(Department  
for Education\) is currently promoting capital programmes to deliver  
the development of new Academies under the stewardship of local  
education authorities in partnership with Academy sponsors. There  
is also the development of Free Schools offering alternative models  
to Local Education Authority \(LEA\) provision, and the introduction  
of the Primary Capital programme for the redevelopment of primary  
schools to meet the demographic growth demand.  
# 1.2 National curriculum  
The national curriculum defines the core entitlement of pupils at all  
stages of their education. It is monitored by the Qualifications and  
Curriculum Authority \(QCA\).  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-38  
# 2 SCHOOL TYPES  
Formal education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16  
years. Typology of schools has increased in recent years with the  
introduction of Academies and Free Schools. The main different  
types are now as follows\:  
• State maintained – These are funded by the DfE through taxation  
at national and local level, often with contributions from local  
diocese and archdiocese organisations. Most maintained schools  
are comprehensive or non-selective of students. However,  
there is a tradition of religious influence in schools through the  
Voluntary Controlled or Voluntary Aided system. These schools  
can develop an admissions policy which allows them to select a  
proportion of students. Students are also usually drawn from a  
much wider catchment than LEA schools. Some authorities still  
operate a grammar school selective system of selection at the  
**35-1** **35-2 Schools**  
age of 11. Some operate a middle school system where the upper  
years of primary school and the lower years of primary school  
are combined.  
• Academies – These are where LEAs work with sponsors to  
organise a school. Sponsors are often from faith or commercial  
backgrounds and can influence the ethos of the school and cur-  
riculum that is delivered. Existing schools can also ‘opt out’ of  
local authority control to become Academies. Academies are  
allowed to select a small proportion of students based upon their  
specialism.  
• Free schools – These are set up by groups interested in the  
promotion of education outside the control of local education  
authorities.  
• Privately funded schools – These are run by their owners or char-  
itable foundations.  
Many Academy and grant maintained schools adopt a special-  
ism – a subject in which they excel. Schools must present evidence  
and apply to the DfE for specialist status from the number of sub-  
ject areas approved by the department. See also the Specialist  
Schools and Academies Trust.  
All-through schools, which take students from Early Years to  
the age of 19, have increased in number recently and the exemplar  
design study by the DfE shows an example of how these may be  
organised.  
# 3 KEY DESIGN INFORMATION AND DESIGN  
# STANDARDS  
# 3.1 School design standards  
There is a significant amount of design guidance, both formal and  
informal, and also best practice documents available for the design  
of schools.  
# 3.2 Legislation  
The legislative framework is based upon the School Premises  
Regulations 2012 and the adoption of the Building Regulations.  
The legislative aspects also apply to independent schools as in the  
Independent Schools Standards 2019 \(see DfE website\).  
Often DfE non-statutory Building Bulletin publications are  
referred to in the approved documents.  
# 3.3 Guidance  
The DfE has published a significant number of Building Bulletins  
and best practice guidance in the form of design notes. This guid-  
ance includes\:  
• Baseline Designs introduced in 2012 \(see Section 3.4\)  
• Area guidance briefing framework BB103 for secondary and pri-  
mary schools  
• Inspirational designs for schools such as the Schools for the  
Future Exemplar Designs for Schools, 2003  
• Very detailed standards such as Environmental Design and  
Ventilation \(BB87 and 101\) and Acoustic Design in schools \(BB93\).  
# 3.4 Baseline Designs  
The Baseline Designs are a series of primary and secondary school  
designs developed by the Education Funding Agency \(EFA\) in  
2012\. The designs demonstrate how the standard output specifi-  
cation developed for the Private Finance 2 \(PF2\) procured schools  
can be met. This specification is also being adopted for other  
schools currently being procured by the EFA to ensure consistency  
across the new estate.  
The Baseline Designs have been developed to Stage 2 of the  
RIBA Plan of Work. One of the key drivers of the designs is  
standardisation – in conceptual approach, detail design and spec-  
ification. This is seen by the EFA as a way of reducing design and  
construction costs and also of producing an equality of provision  
across all schools countrywide.  
The designs meet a standard curriculum in England and Wales,  
but provide flexibility in order to react to other organisations.  
The EFA has undertaken consultations with other user groups to  
help ensure that the designs meet the needs of certain types of  
extra-curricular provision.  
Key features of the designs are\:  
• Simple organisational concepts, such as finger schemes, Figure 35.1,  
where linear classroom wings emanate from a core of common  
spaces, halls, dining, administration and so on, and a ‘superblock’  
concept, Figure 35.2, that places the core large spaces at the centre of  
the building and then wraps classroom spaces around this.  
• A plan organisation that provides for suites of subject-driven  
teaching accommodation. Emphasis is placed on how these suites  
are organised so that this may be repeated across multiple projects.  
• Area standards that are different from the BB98 and 99 guidance  
notes with strict emphasis placed on the provision of teaching  
accommodation over non-teaching.  
• For secondary schools, the overall area formula is 1050 m2  
\(+ 350 m2 if there is a sixth form\) + 6.3 m2/pupil place for 11- to  
16-year-olds + 7 m2/pupil place for post-16 s.  
• For primary schools the overall area formula is 350 m2 + 4.1 m2/  
pupil place.  
• Environmental strategies that have been worked up in some  
detail to ensure that the designs will conform to the environ-  
mental standards of the output specification but also provide  
longer-term flexibility by providing robust and flexible environ-  
mental concepts that will stand up to the building footprint being  
adapted internally.  
• Environmental strategies for teaching spaces that are designed to  
mitigate summertime maximum temperatures, reduce CO2 lev-  
els and provide adequate natural daylight. Daylight is measured  
against how the design utilises available daylight, how even the  
spread of the daylight provided is and whether it is glare free.  
This approach has necessitated that the majority of classroom  
spaces are lit also from the back or corridor face of the room by  
clerestory glazing and top lighting to the corridor spaces.  
In support of the Baseline Designs, the DfE has developed the  
‘*Facilities’* Output Specification \(OS\). This document is a detailed  
set of requirements for the development of school designs under  
the DfE’s various programmes of school development. The OS  
sets out compliance standards which may vary from the existing  
guidance contained within the DfE Building Bulletins. The OS  
and accompanying Generic Design Brief documents are regularly  
updated and can be found on the EFA website  
www.gov.uk/government/publications/output-specification-  
generic-design-brief-and-technical-annexes  
# 3.5 Design Quality Indicators \(DQI\)  
In 2005, the DCFS published a methodology of evaluating school  
design for LEAs and schools, known as DQI for Schools. This is  
a framework of design criteria which is tailored by the individuals  
involved in the project. This tool allows LEAs to represent their  
needs more succinctly to the designers involved in the project. See  
www.dqi.org.uk.  
# 3.6 Commission for Architecture and the Built  
# Environment  
The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment \(CABE\) –  
now part of the Design Council – has developed a framework of  
design support for local authorities involved in the development of  
school buildings. In 2008, minimum design standards developed by  
CABE were adopted by the government for school projects and are  
still a useful guide to successful school design. **Schools 35-3**  
**35.1** *Education Funding Agency Baseline Design for a 1200-place secondary school designed as a ‘finger block’ kit of parts \(Type 1\)*  
CABE’s 10 criteria for successful school design are\:  
• Identity and context\: making a school the students and commu-  
nity can be proud of  
• Site plan\: making the best use of the site  
• School grounds\: making assets of the outdoor spaces  
• Organisation\: creating a clear diagram for the buildings  
• Buildings\: making form, massing and appearance work together  
• Interiors\: creating excellent spaces for learning and teaching  
• Resources\: deploying convincing environmental strategies  
• Feeling safe\: creating a secure and welcoming place

# 3.7 Modern methods of construction  
Modern Methods of Construction \(MMC\) are being encouraged for  
all public building projects by the government in its Construction  
Playbook, published in December 2020. This encourages the pro-  
curement of standardised design, components and interfaces as much  
as possible, as well as digital and offsite manufacturing technologies.  
MMC includes 2D and 3D primary structural systems, non-sys-  
temised structural components and non-structural assemblies as well as  
site labour reduction and productivity improvements. The Construction  
Playbook advocates using platforms that enable ‘interoperability of  
components across different sectors’, requiring collaboration of manu-  
facturers to develop common industry standards. The UK Government  
believes MMC will be beneficial for schools for driving quality and  
reducing cost. MMC can help target net carbon zero and other life-  
long cost issues, improve health and safety on site, and deliver faster  
construction. This is particularly advantageous since the school year  
presents limited construction opportunities.  
# 4 ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN, SUSTAINABILITY  
# AND LOW CARBON DESIGN  
# 4.1 Background  
In 2007, the government commissioned a report into the carbon  
emissions of schools by the Sustainable Development Commission.  
This developed a baseline target of a reduction of around 60 per  
cent based upon the 2002 Building Regulations. Development of  
the Building Regulations subsequently has incorporated a sizable  
proportion of these targets.  
The DCFS developed the ‘carbon calculator’ as a design tool.  
This sets out the environmental and carbon reduction standards to  
be achieved in the design of school buildings and also provides a  
series of methods and energy efficiency measures for achieving the  
required targets. These include reviewing the fabric and form of the **35-4 Schools**  
**35.2** *Education Funding Agency Baseline Design for a 1200-place secondary school designed superblock with sports and changing*  
*facilities annex \(Type 2\)*  
proposed building, including the U values, along with its orientation  
to maximise the passive measures in reducing energy consumption.  
The guidance also describes the various technologies that can  
be adopted to reduce the carbon emissions in schools. According to  
the Sustainable Development Commission, almost 40 per cent of  
the carbon is spent in maintaining the environment of the school.  
More recently, several schools have been developed using the  
Passivhaus design methodology. This is a low energy design meth-  
odology encompassing various strategies for minimising energy  
consumption in the construction and operation of a building.  
Including the development an efficient ‘form factor’ to minimise  
the exposed surface of the building envelope, along with a highly  
insulated and air tight ‘fabric first’ approach to the design and  
detail of the building fabric. Some examples are published on the  
Passivhaus Trust website\: www.passivhaustrust.org.uk  
# 4.2 Ventilation  
The guidance for the carbon calculator also confirms that air-condi-  
tioning is not within standard school construction costs and that in all  
but the most exceptional circumstances, natural ventilation of some  
form should be adopted to optimise both capital and recurrent costs.  
Refer also to BB101 ‘Ventilation of School Buildings’ and  
the complementary calculation tools, ‘Classcool and Classvent’.  
BB101 introduces ventilation performance standards and also cri-  
teria for the prevention of summertime overheating and classroom  
carbon dioxide levels. The maintenance of a suitable classroom  
environment, within suitable temperatures and carbon dioxide lev-  
els, is seen as key to maintaining concentration in students.  
Potential natural ventilation strategies are described next.  
*Night-time cooling via exposed thermal mass*  
The UK has cooler summer temperatures at night. These may be  
exploited using thermal mass or thermal inertia, thereby smoothing  
daily temperature swings. By exposing heavy building fabric in the  
ceiling, it absorbs heat during the day then cools during the night  
when exposed to cool night-time air.  
*Earth tubes*  
These are concrete or clay pipes in the ground through which the supply  
air is passed. They are able to supply pre-warmed air in the winter and  
cooled air in the summer, as the ground itself does not vary much in tem-  
perature over the seasons. They still have an energy requirement for fans.  
*Borehole cooling*  
If a school has access to ground water at a suitable depth and extract  
licences are granted, cool water at 12–15°C can be pumped though  
the pipes of an underfloor heating and cooling system to cool the  
rooms in the summer.  
*Mixed mode cooling*  
A building designed to limit solar gain and equipment gains may  
only overheat for a small percentage of the time. If a reduced size of cooling system is provided for extreme conditions only, and natural  
ventilation is used for most of the time, it is termed mixed mode.  
# 4.3 Day lighting  
Natural day lighting is seen as the primary light source in school  
design and depends on the proportions of the room, amount and  
position of glazing, reflectivity of surfaces and where in the room it  
is being measured. The Baseline Designs give some simple practi-  
cal guidance to achieve good day lighting.  
The use of daylight as the main means of lighting is also rec-  
ommended in BB87. Sometimes site constraints such as adjacent  
buildings or trees will mean electric lighting will be the main source,  
but the designer should strive to avoid this. Daylight provides a less  
stressful environment for pupils and teachers, and saves energy.  
Uniformity or Daylight Autonomy is equally important. If a class-  
room were illuminated perfectly evenly throughout, then it would  
have a uniformity of one. The importance of uniformity in day light-  
ing can be illustrated by the fact that lights can often be found on in  
classrooms even though average daylight is good. Again, the Baseline  
Designs show principles of good day lighting; providing daylight  
from two sides of the room significantly enhances uniformity.  
As far as space planning is concerned, natural lighting and natu-  
ral ventilation are in sympathy. The maximum depths of spaces for  
natural ventilation are comparable with the maximum depths for  
effective day lighting.  
# 4.4 ICT  
The exponential use of technology in the classroom places sig-  
nificant burden on the environmental design of individual spaces.  
However, as technology develops, both PCs and laptop comput-  
ers are becoming more energy efficient and therefore placing less  
burden per unit on the environmental conditions. This is denoted  
through the Energy Star standards on the units.  
There are also a number of strategies for reducing the processing  
power of the computer itself, known as ‘Thin Client’. Here, the process-  
ing is undertaken by a remote server rather than the individual computer,  
thus reducing the energy and heat load in the individual space. For  
details, refer to guidance by the government’s ICT advisors BECTA.  
# 4.5 Energy sources  
Development of low carbon energy solutions is central to low-  
ering the carbon footprint of the nation’s schools, and a number  
of technical solutions have been adopted over the past few years.  
The adoption of any one or combination of these measures needs  
careful consideration by the design team and client as they incur  
considerable capital cost and also recurrent cost over the life of the  
school. The main options are described next.  
*Biomass*  
This refers to an energy source derived from organic matter,  
including wood from forests, waste wood sources and factory  
waste. Over the past few years, a number of local authorities have  
developed supply chain networks to ensure continuity of supply  
as more schools adopt this technology. Ideally, biomass should be  
used close to its source of supply to minimise the environmental  
impact of transportation. Chips require significant storage space  
below or above ground prior to being burned. Pellets are denser  
than chips and have greater calorific value but are more expen-  
sive. Biomass can potentially meet all of a school’s heating needs,  
although it is usual to have some gas back up. It typically reduces  
carbon emissions by 20–30 per cent, being 1/8th of the emissions  
of gas and 1/16th of that of electric heating.  
*Combined heat and power \(CHP\)*  
This is the production of electricity and useful heat in a single pro-  
cess. It can be up to 80 per cent efficient, albeit the overall efficiency  
of the system depends on the ability to use the heat available. This is  
usually dependent on a constant heat requirement of, for instance, a  
# Schools 35-5  
swimming pool or possibly matching load to surrounding housing,  
where the school uses heat during the day and the excess heat is dis-  
tributed later to local housing via a district heating system. Excess  
electricity can be put back into the national grid.  
*Ground source heat pumps \(GSHP\)*  
These use the constant temperature of the ground to provide heat-  
ing or possibly cooling, which is extracted through boreholes or  
loops under the ground. It then produces heat in the school through  
underfloor heating systems. These systems are not carbon zero as  
they use electricity in their operation, but have a coefficient of pro-  
duction of usually 3 or 4 to 1, thus for every 1 Kw that is used, 3 or  
4 Kws are produced in heat.  
*Photovoltaic cells \(PV\)*  
These convert energy from the sun into electricity through sem-  
iconductor cells. They are often applied to façades or roofs of  
buildings. While the cost of PV is reducing, the payback period  
still needs to be carefully considered.  
*Solar thermal*  
Solar hot water systems use energy from the sun to heat hot water.  
Fluid is heated in the panels and then water in a cistern is heated  
through a simple heat exchanger. There are two types of systems\:  
flat plate and evacuated tube systems. Solar thermal hot water can  
work in the less clement months of the year to pre-heat water that  
is boosted by an alternative system.  
*Wind generation*  
Wind turbines are already one of the most cost-effective renewa-  
ble energy options, and with developments in technology and more  
suppliers entering the market, the payback period is becoming  
shorter. Modern freestanding turbines of 6–20 Kw are suitable for  
suburban areas, subject to consultation with local planning author-  
ities, and their use is becoming more accepted.  
# 5 SCHOOL FURNITURE AND ERGONOMICS  
# 5.1 Suitability  
Students come in all shapes and sizes and the furniture that is  
provided for them must respond to this. The provision of inap-  
propriately sized furniture can lead to problems with posture in  
later life and can also affect the ability of the individual student  
to concentrate on the task in hand, reducing their ability to learn  
effectively.  
Since the late 2000s, the market for the provision of furniture  
to schools has increased, as have the design solutions that the  
companies involved now provide. Often project teams will have  
a consultant who will take the lead on the selection and design of  
the Fixed Furniture and Equipment \(FFE\) to be installed. In major  
projects, it is the FFE designer’s responsibility to ensure that the  
selection of FFE meets the relevant British and European standards  
\(BS EN 1729 part 1 and 2 of 2015\) and also to ensure the furni-  
ture has a suitable life span and durability. The FFE designer will  
consult with the client team, educationalist and architect to ensure  
that the FFE to be provided is fully coordinated with, and flexible  
enough to respond to, the various learning styles to be adopted.  
Key design considerations for the architect include ensuring  
that the FFE provided is\:  
• Suitably flexible to adapt with the building to the likely peda-  
gogical style  
• Able to accommodate the physical needs of individual students  
and adapt to their size and shape if required, and also be suitable  
to accommodate less able students  
• In concert with the proposed concept for flexibility and adapt-  
ability within the building layout and structure and services, so  
that the FFE used does not inhibit future flexibility. **35-6 Schools**  
# 5.2 Flexibility of FFE layouts  
The ability for spaces to flex on a daily basis is a key design driver  
in education design and is essential to the delivery of education in  
varied modes to meet the learning styles of students, Figure 35.3.  
Therefore, the ability for spaces to be able to encompass more activ-  
ities is very important. Often, general teaching spaces may need to  
be adapted from time to time to provide light practical workspace.  
This can easily be done through FFE but can be enhanced by sim-  
ply providing a single sink. Specialist spaces such as science need  
to maintain flexibility and the trend is therefore for services such  
as hardwire ICT and water, gas, electrical supplies to be provided  
to the perimeter of the spaces, leaving the centre of the room unen-  
cumbered to increase flexibility.  
# 6 SECURITY AND FIRE SAFETY  
The design of a safe environment for students, staff and the wider  
community is a paramount concern in the design of any school.  
Ofsted pays particular attention to a school’s ability to provide a  
safe environment for students, particularly from the viewpoint of  
deterring intruders. Simple yet effective measures involving single  
entrance points and secure perimeters should be incorporated into  
each school design.  
The local planning authorities will expect that the local Police  
Architectural Design Liaison Officer has been consulted in the devel-  
opment of the design and that the principles of Secured by Design  
have been incorporated into the design of the new facilities. Secured  
by Design’s 2014 Schools Guidance provides a range of advice on  
**35.3** *Flexible FFE layouts for Rhyl High School by AHR Architects* the design of site strategies, the security of the shell of the building,  
internal layout and design through to the management of the facilities.  
School insurers such as Zurich Municipal produce their own design  
guidance for architects. Often local authorities are keen to ensure this  
guidance is followed to ensure the building will be insurable.  
Published by the DfE, BB100 provides design guidance on  
design for fire safety in schools. Design against the risk of fire in  
schools is regulated under the Building Regulations, and BB100  
demonstrates design principles for meeting the standards set in the  
Building Regulations Approved Documents. The Baseline Designs  
have developed a fire strategy that has been informed by the BS 9999  
Code of practice for fire safety in the design, management and use of  
buildings, and is based on the risk profile of the building’s occupants.  
The fire strategy provides for flexibility in the spatial arrange-  
ments and internal layouts. A life safety sprinkler system has been  
included in the secondary school. The simpler primary school  
design does not require a system for life safety.  
Larger projects have become increasingly sophisticated in their  
design since the late 2000s, for instance many schools incorporate  
atria spaces. Therefore, the design for fire prevention often involves  
fire engineering design. This is undertaken by a Fire Engineer to  
ensure that the design meets the design standards of the Approved  
Documents. The role of the architect is to agree the fire strategy  
with the client and design team and to see that the strategy works  
with the overall design concept for the new facilities.  
# 7 EARLY YEARS SCHOOL DESIGN  
# 7.1 Provision  
Early Years Foundation Stage \(EYFS\) education serves children to  
the age of five, including the reception class of compulsory educa-  
tion. In terms of compulsory education, a child must start school at  
the beginning of the next school term following their fifth birthday  
and would at this time enter reception class. However, most chil-  
dren start earlier than this at a nursery class as provision has been  
expanded to provide a part-time place for all 3- and 4-year-olds.  
To help meet this commitment, many other forms of Early  
Years provision has been developed including Sure Start Children’s  
Centres, which are often but not always attached to primary schools.  
All registered providers of Early Years care are required to use  
the EYFS statutory framework. The framework is set around a num-  
ber of key themes\: the development of a unique child; the ability for  
the child to develop positive relationships with others; the creation  
of an environment which supports the role of learning; and the rec-  
ognition that children learn in different ways and at different rates.  
Schools often provide an extended schools provision for stu-  
dents from the age of 4 to 14 providing childcare, breakfast and  
homework clubs for pupils to allow parents flexibility in their work  
arrangements and bring community services into schools. \(See the  
DfE publication *Designing Schools for Extended Services 2006*.\)  
# 7.2 Design principles  
The design of the environment should respond to these EYFS  
framework issues and the architect should be aware of the ways in  
which Early Years pupils learn. CABE in association with the DfE  
has produced a design guide on Sure Start Centres, the principles of  
which are applicable to all environments for Early Years learning.  
Some of the key design principles for Early Years design are\:  
• Development of a rich and varied space to encourage all learning  
styles and independence  
• Natural light and ventilation  
• Sense of scale that relates to the individual  
• Creation of an indoor/outdoor environment with instant acces-  
sibility to both  
• Innovative and challenging landscape  
• Involvement of the whole community in a building that is wel-  
coming and friendly.  
# Schools 35-7  
# 7.3 Area standards  
Area standards for Early Years provision are set out in the EYFS  
statutory framework and give statutory requirements for various  
ages of children \(see also BB103\)\:  
• 0–2 years 3.5 m2 per child  
• 2–3 years 2.5 m2 per child  
• 3–5 years 2.3 m2 per child.  
As a guide, 9 m2 per pupil should be provided for outdoor areas.  
These should provide a diverse, fun and challenging environment  
in which children can learn and grow. Directly outside of learning  
spaces, a covered area should be provided where learning can be  
taken outside in inclement weather. This can, through use of shut-  
ters, also act as a large storage area for play equipment out of hours.  
Storage is a key requirement both externally and internally since  
equipment and toys are often bulky.  
# 7.4 Other design considerations  
There are several other design considerations\:  
• WCs and hand basins should be provided at a ratio of 1 for every  
10 children over the age of 2  
• Provision of a relaxation and sleep area for children who wish  
to rest  
• Provision of a kitchen to provide healthy meals and snacks  
• Facilities for the preparation of babies’ feeds  
• Suitable hygienic changing facilities  
• Staff welfare facilities  
• Suitable office space for the secure keeping of records and meet-  
ings with parents.  
# 8 PRIMARY SCHOOLS \(INCLUDING INFANT,  
# JUNIOR AND FIRST SCHOOLS\)  
# 8.1 Background  
Many primary schools incorporate nurseries and many share sites  
with Sure Start Centres, to provide a full EYFS provision. The first  
year of statutory school provision is the reception class. This takes  
children from 4 to 5 years of age.  
Primary schools deliver Key Stages 1 and 2 of the national cur-  
riculum as set out by the QCA.  
Primary schools are usually organised in Forms of Entry \(FE\),  
for example, 1FE, 2FE, 3FE with notionally circa 30 children per  
class. Therefore, a 1FE school would have a capacity of circa 210  
children and so on.  
# 8.2 Design guidance  
Guidance including sample schedules of accommodation can be  
found in BB103. This superseded BB99, which still proves useful  
for adjacencies and school organisation. A primary school designed  
to these standards is shown in Figure 35.4.  
According to the Baseline Designs developed by the EFA \(see  
Section 3.4\) the overall area formula for primary schools should be  
350 m2 + 4.1 m2/pupil place. An example of a design for a primary  
and nursery school is shown in Figure 35.5. All Baseline Designs  
and BB103 are shown on the DfE website www.gov.uk/government/  
organisations/department-for-education.  
# 8.3 Key Stage 1 and 2 curriculum organisation  
At Key Stages 1 and 2, the statutory subjects that all pupils must  
study are art and design, design and technology, English, geog-  
raphy, history, information and communication technology,  
mathematics, music, physical education and science. Religious  
education must also be provided at Key Stages 1 and 2.  
Children are organised in classes of approximately 30 and are  
sedentary in that the majority of activities are undertaken in the **35-8 Schools**  
**35.4** *Hylands Primary School in Hornchurch, Essex, was designed by Walters and Cohen for the London Borough of Havering and*  
*conforms to BB99. This ground floor plan shows classrooms and hall on the perimeter with a central courtyard and inner ‘heart’ space*  
classroom. Therefore, the classroom should provide a varied envi-  
ronment, particularly in the Early Years. In the upper years of KS2,  
the teaching and learning experience becomes more formal and the  
learning setting responds to this.  
Classrooms should have direct access to external areas to take  
teaching and learning outside. This needs to be an immediate rela-  
tionship to give the greatest opportunity to enhance the learning  
experience.  
Specialist activities, such as music, drama and PE, usually  
take place in the school hall or in the case of music, small support  
spaces. Occasionally, schools will increase the amount of specialist  
space by enhancing a classroom in KS2 to undertake light practical  
work in science and technology for the older students.  
# 8.4 ICT  
ICT plays an ever-increasing part in the delivery of learning. In  
primary schools, significant ICT provision is usually confined to an  
ICT suite or room, often located adjacent to or within the library or  
Learning Resource Centre area. However, each classroom from the  
Early Years onwards will contain up to approximately three com-  
puters for use during the various class settings utilised throughout  
the day.  
# 8.5 Site organisation  
Since primary schools serve a very close catchment area, it is  
likely that a significant proportion of the children will walk  
to school. There are a number of initiatives to encourage this  
and many authorities encourage ‘walking buses’ by providing  
equipment such as highly visual jackets, for parents to organise  
themselves.  
Therefore, in all schools, design to separate vehicular traffic and  
pedestrians will be a key concern of planning and highways author-  
ities when assessing the scheme. This is particularly important at  
times of access and egress when the site is very busy. However,  
car drop off and pick up by parents in many instances is inevita-  
ble, and the design needs to manage this well to avoid congestion,  
providing turning and waiting areas. There will also be the need to  
accommodate bus use either for occasional trips or in more rural  
circumstances the drop off and pick up of students from outlying  
areas.  
Provision of staff parking is usually restricted by local planning  
regulations and must be considered as part of an overall transport  
policy by the school and the LEA together in a ‘Green Travel Plan’.  
Many schools have adopted the Eco School standard, which aims  
to make children and their parents aware of the carbon footprint of  
the schools and their own personal activities including how they  
get to school.  
Security of the site is also a key consideration and the build-  
ing form and site organisation should create clear areas of public  
and private domain to ensure the security of the children and  
teachers.  
Often children will access the school through their individual  
classrooms via the playground. This needs to be a managed pro-  
gression from the public areas of the site. **Schools 35-9**  
**35.5** *a first floor and b ground floor plan of an Education Funding Agency Baseline Design for a Type 2, 420-place primary school with 26*  
*nursery places. Large classroom option*  
# 8.6 Community use  
Community use of school buildings is increasing, with buildings  
seen as a resource for the whole community. These include\:  
• Use of the school for breakfast and after school clubs  
• Community drop-in facilities for the local authority to give  
advice, community policing or even community health services  
• Community library facilities which are shared by the school  
• Community support facilities will often be linked to a Sure Start  
Children’s Centre.  
# 8.7 Building form  
Over the past few decades, primary schools have usually been single-  
or two-storey buildings, which have related to a particular context and  
construction methodology. In recent years, however, several notable  
projects have challenged this conception as site areas have become  
more constrained and resources more scarce. On very constrained  
sites, primary schools have been combined with residential accommo-  
dation above as in the St Thomas’ Primary School in Kensington by  
Pollard Thomas Edwards Architects as shown in Figure 35.6. All these  
designs still maintain the crucial relationships between indoor and out-  
door spaces, some through the provision of elevated play decks.  
# 8.8 Organisation  
There are several core spaces common to all schools\:  
*Reception*  
This is the arrival point for parents and visitors during the day. The  
space should be bright and welcoming and give a view of school  
activity to demonstrate that the building is a place of learning. It  
should also be able to display the work of the school. Around the  
reception will be administration spaces, often including the office  
of the head, and a parent or visitor room for meetings with parents,  
or use by peripatetic health visitors and others.  
*The hall*  
This will be used for numerous activities including PE, music,  
drama, assemblies, social events and dining. Most children will  
stay in school for school dinners or will eat their packed lunch  
in the hall, so the kitchen needs to be adjacent but also have safe  
access and egress for deliveries.  
*Classrooms*  
These spaces must provide a varied environment, and be supported  
by flexible spaces between classes for breakout or the withdrawal  
of students for personalised tuition. Storage is also critical to the **35-10 Schools**  
BB103 shows the overall areas to be provided, but environmen-  
tal diversity is critically important to the creation of a successful  
school.  
Spaces close to the building need to provide shelter from the  
wind and cover from the rain, particularly for the earliest years.  
Orientation of teaching and learning spaces is critical in achiev-  
ing a successful balance, and this must be considered at the earliest  
stages of site planning. Provision of protected spaces will allow the  
teachers to take children outside to demonstrate the principles of  
the subject being learnt.  
There should be a progression and hierarchy in the spaces  
as they move away from the building form to give harder play  
areas and also spaces that allow children to read and socialise.  
Hard areas usually double as court spaces for outdoor PE. Playing  
fields are usually positioned furthest away from the building but  
with direct access from hard areas to give a natural progression  
in the warmer months of the year and an open feel to the site’s  
periphery.

# 9 SECONDARY SCHOOLS  
# 9.1 Background  
Students move to secondary school at the age of 11 and study  
the secondary national curriculum through KS3 and 4 to the age  
of 16. Full details of the secondary national curriculum can be  
obtained from the QCA website. The studies are directed towards  
formal qualifications obtained at the age of 16. From secondary  
education, many students stay on in education, either by attend-  
ing a sixth form in the school or another school or by moving to  
local FE colleges which provide a range of vocational and aca-  
demic courses as a stepping stone to university, further training  
or employment.  
Secondary schools take many forms. The majority are compre-  
hensive schools in that they do not choose their student intake on  
academic ability. However, specialist schools and Academies can  
apply some methods of selection based upon the specialism of the  
particular school.  
successful operation of a school to store both resources and work  
in progress.  
*Toilets*  
These should be provided at a minimum standard of 1 for every 20  
children, often at a rate of two per class. It is often associated with  
cloakrooms en route to the play areas, and provides a wet lobby area.  
Often schools operate an indoor shoe policy where children change  
shoes on entering. Separate sex WCs need to be provided for children  
over the age of 8. Disabled WCs should be provided for staff and  
children and many authorities do not allow these to be doubled up.  
*Staff facilities*  
These should provide a relaxing environment, but equally often  
provide a small work area for preparation of lesson material. Staff  
WCs are positioned close by. The deputy head’s room often dou-  
bles as a visitors’ interview room.  
*Caretaker’s facilities*  
These include storage and maintenance equipment, usually with  
easy access to the service areas of the school.  
# 8.9 Landscape and recreation  
The relationship between indoor and outdoor spaces has become  
increasingly important to the education environment in recent years  
as educationalists strive to create a diverse number of learning set-  
tings. This is to ensure that children are able to learn according to  
their individual needs.  
# 9.2 Size and structure  
Schools vary greatly in size, from the smallest secondary at 450  
pupils to the largest at over 2000. However, there has been a move  
in recent years to have a minimum size of 750 students and a max-  
imum at 1500 students, rising to circa 1800 if the school includes  
a sixth form. The optimum sizes and the most common in recent  
school design are 900, 1050, 1200 and 1500 students.  
The larger the school, the greater the need to break down the  
size of the school into manageable pastoral groups where stu-  
dents and staff can relate to each other in a positive way. Schools  
are responsible for the well-being of the whole student, not just  
academic achievement, and pastoral management of students is  
a crucial issue. Therefore, the creation of pastoral groups around  
houses or year groups is common in schools. House groups involve  
a vertical structure, which brings a number of students from each  
year group together into a house. The advantages of this are that  
the older students help to peer mentor younger students. A negative  
may be that the group are likely only to be together for pastoral  
times in the timetable.  
Alternatively, pastoral groups may be based on year or half year  
groups. This does not have the positives of bringing together older  
and younger students, but other than for streaming of certain sub-  
jects, the students will spend the majority of time together.  
Year 7, the first year in secondary school, is often separated  
out from the other years. This is to avoid any dip in performance  
during the Year 7 transition between primary and secondary  
schools. Often Year 7 will have separate social and play areas  
and will gradually integrate themselves into the wider social life  
of the school. **9.3 Guidance**  
Details of standard schedules of accommodation can be found in  
BB103 Area Guidelines for Mainstream Schools, which replaces  
BB98, by the DfE.  
According to the Baseline Designs developed by the EFA  
\(Section 3.4\), the overall area formula for secondary schools should  
be\: 1050 m2 \(+ 350 m2 if there is a sixth form\) + 6.3 m2/pupil place  
for 11- to 16-year-olds + 7 m2/pupil place for post-16 s. Baseline  
Designs are shown in full on the DfE website. A design for a 1850-  
pupil secondary school is shown as Figure 35.7.  
# 9.4 Educational organisation  
Traditionally schools have followed a subject-based curriculum  
organisation, bringing together all general teaching spaces which  
would cater for subjects such as English, maths and humanities,  
and separating out specialist spaces for science and technology.  
Spaces for ICT would traditionally be located as a central resource  
and music and drama space with the hall for performances and also  
as a potential community facility. Sports would also be located with  
proximity to playing fields and MUGA \(Multi-Use Games Area\)  
spaces, but also close to car parking for ease of community use.  
This organisation is still relevant and with good design can be  
made into a very flexible, educationally driven solution. However,  
education theory and practice often moves architects to consider  
other ways of organising schools.  
At one end of the spectrum is the *schools within schools* model,  
which brings a series of spaces together to cater for the needs of  
a particular cohort of, say, 150 students. They would be provided  
with the majority of facilities required to enable the group to remain  
in this area for the majority of the time, only moving away to access  
very specialist facilities or to participate in sports. Typically, the  
group would have a series of general classrooms, breakout facilities  
and small group rooms, and also a number of specialist facilities to  
provide technology and science facilities. The group would have  
direct access to a varied landscape. Dining could be communal or  
taken in the breakout space of the school dependent upon the phi-  
losophy.  
# 9.5 Areas and space typology  
BB103 sets out the area requirements for each space. Some of the  
key space types are noted next\:  
• General teaching spaces – 55 m2 for 30 pupils  
• ICT Spaces – 62 m2 for 30 pupils  
• Light technology \(graphics, textiles etc\) – 83 m2 for 25–30 pupils  
• Science – 90 m2 for 30 pupils  
• Large technology \(resistant materials, food\) – 104 m2 for 24  
pupils.  
This model brings together the positive mentor relationships  
between a small group of students and staff who would essentially  
deliver all teaching and learning to the group all of the time. The  
model is particularly adaptable to project-based learning where  
cross-subject teaching is implemented. Often the school would be  
designed so that each school could be adjusted to create larger or  
smaller groups as the circumstances dictated.  
A similar but less radical model is the creation of *home base*  
spaces within a school, with group teaching spaces around them.  
These can be designed to accommodate a year or house group  
rather than necessarily being purely subject-based. Specialist  
spaces can be positioned remotely from the home base for effi-  
ciency of use. Again, the organisation principle is that the student  
would spend the majority of time relating directly to the group  
in cross-subject teaching, relating directly to a smaller number of  
teachers and mentors.  
# 9.6 Site organisation  
The key principles of organising a school site are to\:  
# Schools 35-11  
• Create a positive public domain which welcomes the community  
onto the site  
• Create distinct public and private domains that create a safe  
working environment for all  
• Create a clear separation of vehicular traffic and pedestrians and  
organisation of drop off and pick up  
• Create a diverse landscape that enhances the curriculum  
• Optimise the orientation of buildings and indoor and outdoor  
spaces to make the most of the climatic conditions and help  
create a sustainable solution. This needs to be considered in the  
earliest stages of design.  
Schools are major buildings in their local communities. New  
school buildings create a sense of local pride, and the architecture  
and design should respond positively to these issues. Creating a  
positive public domain is critical to the way in which the school  
announces itself to its local community, and many school designs  
incorporate plaza type spaces for the community to inhabit. Car  
parking and accessibility for bus drop off and pick up is a major  
logistical issue on any school site, and must be designed logically  
and to enhance safely.  
# 9.7 Landscape and recreation areas  
BB103 Annex B provides guidance on the provision of the net site  
area and playing field provision. Often the planning authorities will  
ask for the views of Sport England to be considered during the  
planning process. Provision includes\:  
• Sports pitches  
• Games courts \(MUGA\)  
• Soft informal and social areas  
• Hard informal and social areas  
• Habitat areas.  
The diversity of the landscape and the learning environment  
that it provides is key to creating a successful school environment.  
The Faraday Project, a research project into the teaching of science  
by the DfE, places a significant importance on the development of  
a creative landscape for learning.  
The development of successful social spaces is also critical  
to the development of social skills in young people, and the rela-  
tionship between dining and external areas as overspill space is an  
important consideration.  
On more confined sites, the creative development of sports  
facilities, including mountain bike tracks and trim trails, are often  
incorporated to encourage the maximum use of sporting facilities  
and also encourage students who dislike team sports to become  
active. All weather facilities allow much more intensive use and  
synthetic pitches can be a significant community resource, particu-  
larly when used with floodlighting, and so can be counted as double  
in the space provision in BB98.  
# 9.8 Community use  
Secondary schools are seen as major community resources and  
as such are often open for many more hours beyond the school  
day for\:  
• Serving the extended schools agenda and also encouraging  
students to remain in school to undertake homework, use ICT  
facilities or participate in group activities  
• Accommodating other local authority services, community  
police and health facilities  
• Crèche services for students and the wider community  
• Significant community facilities such as libraries with associated  
cafe. It may be part of the ethos of the school to allow the com-  
munity to access such facilities during the school day. Clear lines  
of security and separation are needed to ensure that this is done  
elegantly. **35-12 Schools**  
**35.7** *Education Funding Agency Baseline Design \(ground floor\) for an 1850-pupil Type 1 secondary school* The design of a new school should be zoned in both security and envi-  
ronmental terms to accommodate community use. A clear and simple  
zoning strategy will allow the building to be operated out of hours at  
minimal cost by minimising attendance and heating and lighting use.  
# 9.9 Reception and social spaces  
It is common practice to provide a single point of entry for all  
users of the building, students, staff and visitors alike. Therefore,  
a key requirement is to be able to receive high volumes of people  
efficiently and effectively while providing a pleasant environment  
that will engage visitors in the work and ethos of the school. This  
involves detailed design of reception spaces, and the ability for the  
reception to have a direct connection with other parts of the school.  
Administration facilities are positioned adjacent to the recep-  
tion. These are an extensive facility dealing with school finances  
and the administration of student records and so on.  
Social spaces for students are important. They can act as break-  
out spaces for teaching and learning when not in use, but also help  
to give the students a sense of ownership, as well as providing  
space where lockers, if required, can be easily accessed. Often  
these are provided for each year group. They can also form home  
base spaces for student groups.  
# 9.10 General teaching spaces  
BB103 provides sizes of teaching spaces and associated storage  
based upon the group sizes. General teaching spaces need to pro-  
vide a flexible environment and are often grouped in curriculum  
areas. Furniture needs to be flexible and easily moved and stored  
to enable the room to accommodate various teaching and learning  
settings. These settings may need to be changed quickly.  
All services will be to the periphery of the room. These will  
consist of power and data facilities. ICT will often be wireless and  
connected through laptop computers as non-specialist activities use  
less memory.  
Within each group of general classrooms, it is useful to have a flex-  
ible dividing screen between two rooms to provide a larger space for  
activities, lectures or small examinations. Flexible screens are expen-  
sive and are compromised in terms of acoustics; however, when used  
judiciously they can add great flexibility to a working environment.  
# 9.11 Science  
The development of science teaching to a more explorative and  
interactive way of learning, along with much greater involvement  
of technology, has led to a rethink of the science environments in  
schools. Many of the studies suggest a mix of spaces, moving away  
from purely using the traditional science laboratory to the devel-  
opment of less heavily serviced science spaces. These spaces are  
lightly serviced spaces that can flex to potentially become a larger  
demonstration space for experiments, a space where results are col-  
lated using ICT. Preparation facilities are often centralised in the  
department to provide a facility for the preparation of materials for  
lessons and the storage of equipment.  
Laboratories are also now more lightly serviced and flexible,  
with servicing, water, gas and electricity to the periphery of the  
room \(see also Chapter 25, Section 3.6\). This again gives flexi-  
bility to the centre of the space. Rooms within the department can  
be more open with the use of glazed screens creating visual links  
between spaces and creating a more professional world of work  
environment.  
Science is also taken out of the classroom into the whole school  
site using the built and natural environment as the backdrop for  
the exploration of science, creating, for example, living recycling  
systems.  
# 9.12 Technology  
Technology is the subject that most naturally replicates the world  
of industry, and incorporates subjects that design an object or prod-  
uct, then creates the product and markets it through graphics and  
# Schools 35-13  
media. Technology studies are also expanding to include voca-  
tional subjects such as land-based studies, food and catering and  
construction as part of the expanding 14–19 agenda.  
A typical technology department will have a series of specialist  
spaces in enclosed areas around a central space that will be ICT-  
based, possibly a design subject. The whole department will often  
be open with glazed screens between rooms. Often spaces of a  
similar type, for instance resistant materials, will be joined to give  
an open studio feel. This also ensures access to equipment so that  
expensive machinery is not doubled up.  
Guidance on areas for each subject area is given in BB98. These  
spaces are much larger than general teaching spaces – usually  
between 90 and 130 m2 depending on the subject. The storage and  
preparation facilities for the materials, equipment and tools associ-  
ated with these areas are also large. In addition, secure storage for  
students’ work is essential – both work in progress and completed  
work awaiting final assessment.  
ICT is usually hard-wired fixed machines which can use high  
memory capacity for design and graphics programmes. This usu-  
ally increases the cooling load on the spaces.  
# 9.13 Art and design  
Often associated with technology, these spaces can create an open  
studio feel. When possible, spaces should be higher than standard  
floor-to-floor height. This can help the display and storage of work.  
2D art rooms can often be used with textiles, while 3D art rooms  
are often self-contained. Ceramics is dusty and the need to provide  
a separate kiln space often precludes pairing ceramics with other  
art subjects.  
# 9.14 Learning Resource Centre \(LRC\)  
With the increasing use of ICT throughout schools, the LRC is no  
longer the hub of technology, and the trend is for the spaces to revert  
to the written form. Often an LRC will have a series of areas from  
informal lounge area to formal teaching area that can be used for  
lessons when needed. Community use of these spaces for internet  
access is high and some schools encourage this during the school day  
and provide refreshment facilities. In these circumstances, the opera-  
tion and security arrangements need to be very carefully considered.  
The environment should be bright and stimulating, and, given  
the high degree of community access, schools often display the  
work of the students and their outreach work to the community.  
# 9.15 Music and drama  
Often grouped together, the larger dance spaces may also double  
up as activity studios with the sports department. Music other than  
group performances in the hall or other small performance spaces  
takes place in smaller group or ensemble rooms, with one or two  
larger rooms for teaching. The acoustic qualities of these spaces  
are a key consideration, as is the provision of secure storage since  
instruments are often large and expensive. Storage is often used as  
an acoustic buffer between spaces.  
Dance spaces need extra height and the use of sprung flooring with  
a series of curtains and mirrors. Drama spaces often benefit from extra  
height for lighting for rehearsals. Neither space is elaborate.  
# 9.16 Hall spaces  
Hall spaces need to be flexible and offer themselves to as many uses  
as possible such as performances, parents’ evenings and assemblies  
\(but not of the whole school as the space is seldom big enough\). As  
sports halls are often used for examinations they need to have some  
acoustic isolation, although the trend is away from this as examina-  
tion pressure can often be taken up in other ways.  
# 9.17 Dining  
Dining is often seen as a social experience that is part of the devel-  
opment of the whole child. Staff are also encouraged to use the **35-14 Schools**  
facilities to help create positive relationships. Therefore, dining  
periods are being extended to make the experience more pleasura-  
ble and more detail is being placed on the design and operation of  
the facilities, particularly the installation of FFE and the provision  
of outdoor dining.  
Often dining is divided into several offers ranging from a full  
service incorporating hot meals, salads and jacket potatoes, to a  
sandwich take away often located away from the main dining areas.  
Kitchens are designed by specialist catering designers to ensure  
that hygiene regulations are met and also that the throughput of  
pupils to be served in the time allowed is met. The architect should  
see that the kitchen design is coordinated into the design concept  
for dining.  
# 9.18 Staff facilities  
A welfare room with associated toilets is provided for staff. This  
will vary in size and capacity dependent upon the ethos of the  
school and the function that is to be met. WCs should also be pro-  
vided at strategic locations throughout the school, within regulation  
distances. Staff should not share WCs with students. Staff offices  
and workspaces should be located strategically throughout the  
school to maximise passive supervision.  
# 10 SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND  
# DISABILITY PROVISION \(SEND\)  
# 10.1 Strategy  
The government’s strategy for students with SEND is set out in the  
DfE document *Removing Barriers to Achievement*. This sets out the  
policy framework for local authorities and schools to follow and is  
aimed at assessing the needs of pupils quickly and developing a  
personalised plan for learning. This can be set within mainstream  
or more traditional special school settings dependent upon the abil-  
ities of the pupil.  
Following on from this document there has been a move  
towards accommodating pupils with fewer difficulties in main-  
stream schools and also to co-locating special needs provision with  
mainstream. This is either on the same campus or within the same  
building and creates a design challenge to integrate students while  
protecting the most vulnerable.  
The landscape of special needs provision has changed signifi-  
cantly in recent years and the design guidance has been updated in  
the form of Building Bulletin 104\: Area Guidelines for SEND and  
Alternative Provision. Note that BB102 is still a useful guide for  
SEND design principles. Both are available on the DfE website.  
# 10.2 Provision within mainstream schools  
Accessibility legislation in recent new-build schools ensures a  
certain level of accessibility for students with mobility, sight and  
hearing issues. However, to accommodate pupils with more com-  
plex issues, schools may have to be adapted to the particular needs  
of an individual student.  
Often schools will encompass a unit to address particular issues,  
for instance autism, or hearing or sight impairment. These are  
located within the school, but the design of the learning environ-  
ment will be tailored to the special need that the space addresses.  
This has become increasingly common as authorities seek to  
accommodate students with less complex needs in mainstream edu-  
cation. This is to ensure the entitlement of the individual pupil to a  
full and fulfilling education.  
# 10.3 Special school provision  
The move towards personalisation of education and the empha-  
sis on the uniqueness of the individual has removed a significant  
amount of generic terminology in special school design. No longer  
are schools for Moderate Learning Difficulties \(MLD\) or Profound  
and Multiple Learning Difficulties \(PMLD\) students; schools must  
have the ability to react to the needs of all students. Often schools  
will accommodate students with completely varying ranges of  
abilities across the whole spectrum of special needs. BB102 neatly  
summarises within Annex F the key definitions and issues relating  
to the various difficulties that pupils may have. Schools may also  
be of all-through age ranges.  
# 10.4 Areas and space  
While area guidance for SEND provision has been updated in BB  
104, BB102 also provides a series of schedules and design examples  
for the provision of special school facilities. These provide areas per  
pupil ranging between 40 and 45 m2 per pupil – significantly higher  
than mainstream schools. A classroom of 65 m2 usually accommo-  
dates 8 to 10 pupils, dependent upon their abilities and age. Schools  
will have a mix of general teaching and specialist spaces; specialist  
spaces for art, food technology and ICT are most common.  
In designing an SEN school, the site organisation is key to a  
successful design. Strategies for arrival and departure of large  
numbers of specialist vehicles used to transport the pupils need to  
adopted, along with the separation of public and private zones in  
the school to ensure safeguarding of the pupils at all times.  
Other particular areas to consider when designing for SEN  
include\:  
• A significant area for the equipment to support the pupils in the  
teaching space and to create a series of learning environments  
within the room.  
• A direct and level link to a covered and secure outdoor space is  
essential. Often schemes are centred around an external court  
with raised beds and sensory gardens.  
• Significant areas should be given to non-teaching space, for  
instance large hygiene facilities adjacent to general classrooms  
often with hoists to assist the less able students.  
• Large areas for the storage of equipment. Often pupils will have  
more than one wheelchair and will change from one to another  
on entering the building.  
• Medical facilities for visiting peripatetic clinicians.  
• Hydrotherapy pool for physiotherapy with associated changing  
facilities.  
• A sensory environment with soft furnishings, lighting equipment  
and music.  
• A central hall that is easily accessible – important because it is  
common practice for pupils to gather morning and evening for  
arrival and departure via mini buses and taxis. The hall is often  
multi-use for sport and dining dependent upon the size of the  
school.  
• External spaces need to be secured and sheltered from the ele-  
ments and have a variety of surfaces. Planting is often raised in  
order for pupils to be able to access the plants.  
# 10.5 Alternative provision – schools for students with  
# behavioural, emotional and social difficulties  
Behavioural, emotional and social difficulties pupils often follow a  
curriculum the same or near to that of mainstream schools, albeit  
with a vocational emphasis. The emphasis is on re-engagement  
of the student with education and behavioural modification. The  
buildings and external environment are often secure to ensure  
that the pupils stay in place. The subjects taught will include, for  
instance, car maintenance at the upper years and are aimed at the  
need to provide the pupils with a transferable skill. Subjects such as  
this are also used to engage the pupils with education.  
Buildings are often arranged around a court. Internal spaces are  
usually smaller than mainstream schools and accommodate fewer  
pupils. A series of chill out spaces are provided to give space to the  
individual as and when required. Sport and outdoor activity will  
often play a big part in the curriculum, through the provision of  
5-a-side courts and indoor sports facilities. Pupils often arrive alone or in small groups by taxi or mini  
bus. Drop off facilities very close to the secure main entrance are  
essential.

criminal purposes.  
• Threat\: threats are potential events or activities that have the  
potential to cause harm or loss and can be expressed as Threat =  
Capability × Intent.  
• Risk\: risk is a way of expressing the potential for a threat to  
cause loss or harm expressed in terms of probability and impact.  
This can be shown as Risk = Probability \(of an occurrence\) ×  
Impact \(of an event or threat\).  
• Risk treatment\: these are the measures taken to reduce the impact  
and probability of an event and can include avoidance, transfer,  
mitigation or acceptance.  
• Residual risk\: this is the level of risk remaining once mitigation  
measures have been applied.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
Security has not traditionally been at the forefront of concerns  
when architects, planners and designers consider the central  
requirements of a new-build project. Aesthetics, accessibility,  
functionality and cost will trump security in most cases, save  
perhaps for specific high profile, military or secure facility pro-  
jects. However, it is increasingly recognised that designers  
have a responsibility to consider security requirements. In the  
contemporary risk society, with an increasingly crowded urban  
environment, ‘resilience’ is perhaps the critical term\: resilient not  
just against natural geo- and hydro-meteorological hazards \(such  
as earthquakes and floods\), but against all forms of criminality,  
terrorist attacks and the deadly threat of a VBIED \(vehicle-borne  
improvised explosive device\) detonation or CBRN \(chemical,  
biological, radiological or nuclear\) attack. This chapter covers the  
incorporation of security measures into projects to help address  
such threats and risks.  
# 1.1 Definitions  
For purposes of clarity and to ensure a common understanding,  
some common security terms are explained.  
• Security\: can be used to describe either\:  
○ The condition where our people, assets and interests are pro-  
tected from harm or loss from criminality and terrorism.  
or  
# 2 SECURITY DESIGN PRINCIPLES  
In designing security measures for a project, the following princi-  
ples should be considered\:  
• Deterrence  
• Detection  
• Delay  
• Response  
• Pursuit  
• Reassurance.  
# 2.1 Deterrence  
The level of security provision should be such that would-be  
attackers – criminal, terrorist or simply anti-social – are dissuaded  
from targeting the completed scheme. Bluntly, their activities are  
either halted or displaced to an alternative, less well-protected site.  
Deterrence can be achieved by measures that may include\:  
• Adherence to concepts such as ‘defensible space’ and security  
through environmental design  
• Visible security features including perimeter fences, CCTV and  
lighting. For those who have been granted legitimate access to a  
location, physical measures such as security turnstiles, internal  
CCTV and intruder detection will provide a strong visual deter-  
rent. A determined attacker carrying out a hostile reconnaissance  
will identify these measures as well as less overt ones such as  
fence line Perimeter Intrusion Detection System \(PIDS\) and  
infrared lighting on fully functional pan tilt zoom \(PTZ\) CCTV  
• The provision of vehicle access control measures  
• The deployment of a well-trained and motivated guard force  
• Internal CCTV coverage within reception areas and loading docks.  
○ The identification of threats and risks from criminality and ter-  
rorism and the measures taken to mitigate them.  
• Physical security\: these are hard measures put in place to help  
deliver security. It can include electronic systems \(CCTV, access  
control, intruder detection\) fences, gates, door sets, glazing sys-  
tems, barriers and bollards.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-39  
# 2.2 Detection  
Should someone wish to target a particular site, there should be a  
high probability that they will be detected. This may be during a  
**36-1** **36-2 Security and counter-terrorism**  
reconnaissance/planning stage by a determined criminal, or while  
in the process of committing a crime. Detection can be achieved  
through measures that include\:  
• A PIDS system on a perimeter fence that will detect cutting and  
climbing attacks  
• CCTV linked to PIDS to provide verification of the cause of an alarm  
• Fully functional PTZ cameras with a day and night capability to  
track attackers attempting to breach a fence line or building envelope  
• Detection system on external doors, access hatches and glazed  
services  
• CCTV slaved to detection to provide verification of the cause of  
an alarm on any of these detectors  
• Access control and intruder detection on designated doors and  
rooms within buildings  
• Facilities for the screening of visitors.  
# 2.3 Delay  
Measures should be in place that are sufficient to slow an attacker down  
and to prevent an attack succeeding prior to a response being mounted  
by the security personnel or police. It therefore follows that speed of  
response must be linked to the delay that can be imposed through the  
use, for example, of appropriate external door and window sets.  
# 2.4 Response  
There must be a capability to respond to incidents or potential inci-  
dents rapidly. This may be by security or FM personnel or by the  
police, and can be achieved through\:  
• Well-understood internal reporting systems for staff  
• Local security control rooms  
• Automatic response generated from remote monitoring centres.  
# 2.5 Pursuit  
In the event of incident in or around a site, sufficient information  
must be retrievable from electronic systems and manned security  
personnel to support investigation and, if required, prosecution.  
This is achieved through\:  
• Deployment of CCTV cameras specified to achieve 10 per cent,  
25 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent screen heights \(images  
of subjects\) matched to their location and role  
• Permanent recording and archiving of CCTV images  
• Recording and archiving of access control and intruder detection  
systems event records  
• Recording of reports by security and other personnel.  
# 2.6 Reassurance  
Security provision must provide building occupants and visitors  
with the confidence that they are properly protected without cre-  
ating an oppressive feel and should also instil confidence in all  
stakeholders. Measures can include\:  
**36.1** *An incremental approach to security design*  
• Appropriate lighting levels and clear lines of site  
• Use of high reliability access control systems and other security  
devices with high availability and minimum false alarms  
• Deployment of security hardware such as turnstiles and car park  
access control systems  
• Procedures at staff and visitors access points that are efficient  
and professionally executed.  
# 3 DESIGNING A SYSTEM  
# 3.1 Integration  
Security must be considered as a whole to achieve the vision  
and objectives of a given scheme. Integrated technical, physical  
and procedural measures, within the context of a threat and risk  
assessment, should be applied. No one item should be considered  
in isolation. The physical performance of a fence for example is  
considered in the context of the threat and risk; the capability of  
detection and surveillance systems; the ability of security guards  
to respond; and the policies and procedures that will hold the ele-  
ments together.  
# 3.2 Security planning  
Security requirements should be considered as early as possible  
within the design process. The earlier it is considered, the more  
economic and operationally effective the solution. A suggested  
design process flow chart is shown in Figure 36.1.  
# 3.3 Physical and technical security  
The following security measures fall into the category of phys-  
ical provision. Professional advice should be sought regarding  
the application and design of such measures which are cov-  
ered by a myriad of standards and which are discussed in more  
detail later.  
• Fences  
• Perimeter intruder detection and surveillance  
• Electronic access control  
• Turnstiles  
• Door and window sets  
• Internal detection and surveillance  
• Fixed and fully functional PTZ cameras  
• Fixed cameras viewing points of entry.  
The application of these measures will help deliver the following.  
# 3.4 Surveillance and detection  
A surveillance and detection plan should be considered for any  
scheme and will involve the deployment of technology along-  
side the concepts of natural surveillance and manned security.  
Surveillance can provide advance warning of an incident; support  
the management of an ongoing incident; provide a deterrent and support investigations. Importantly, CCTV can also be used to pro-  
vide verification of detection system alarms.  
# 3.5 Secure sites/building envelope  
The integrity of buildings should be capable of being maintained 24  
hours per day and can be achieved through measures that include\:  
• Robust construction  
• Electronic and physical access control arrangements  
• Surveillance of the building envelope by CCTV linked to detec-  
tion technologies  
• Positioning of intruder detection on exterior doors and glazing.  
# 3.6 Maintaining internal integrity of buildings  
Ensuring that security threats can be kept outside of the building  
envelope, or within reception zones, is an important principle. The  
integrity of buildings can be maintained through the screening of  
visitors at reception areas, electronic access control systems or  
other local access control arrangements. It can be useful to consider  
a scheme in terms of security zones, each with their own security  
levels and standards. Typically zones would be\:  
• Public areas such as building approaches and car parks  
• Reception areas  
• Operations areas where business is carried out  
• Security areas such as data centres.  
# 3.7 Procedural security  
*General*  
Technology and physical measures alone will not provide the lev-  
els of security required and there will always be a procedural and  
human element that will tie these measures together. Procedural  
security is also among the most visible of the elements of security  
provision and can be stepped up and down very quickly to respond  
to changing threats.  
*Scalability*  
Macro and micro security threat levels can rise and fall and the  
security posture within a location may need to be capable of being  
raised and lowered accordingly. Changing security postures can  
also act as a deterrent by creating uncertainty in the minds of  
would-be aggressors and can serve to keep security personnel  
focused and motivated.  
# 3.8 Manned security  
For certain sites and office locations, staffed security provision may  
be appropriate. Staffed security can provide a uniformed, visual  
presence at designated points as a deterrent to criminality and ter-  
rorism and to provide reassurance to staff. Typical roles include\:  
• Operation of security control rooms, surveillance and detection  
equipment  
• Supervision and control of access control gate lines  
• Patrol of designated areas to detect and deter criminal activity  
and to provide reassurance  
• Reaction capability to respond to emergencies.  
The relationships between the elements of an integrated security  
system are illustrated in Figure 36.2.  
# 3.9 Standards and compliance  
All technical, physical and procedural security should be designed  
and operated in accordance with the appropriate legislation, reg-  
ulation and standards \(e.g. Data Protection Act \(1998\), ISO, BS/  
EN\). Where clients such as the MoD or insurers impose particular  
requirements, these must also be met. There is a wealth of freely  
available information on security planning, standards, tested prod-  
ucts and their application which include\:

# 4 COUNTER-TERRORISM CONCEPTS AND  
# STANDARDS  
Terrorism is the systematic use of terror especially as a means of  
coercion. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of vio-  
lence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity  
for a group, cause or individual. The groups and individuals that  
practise terrorism in any one region will vary over time. Different  
groups and individuals will have different capabilities and  
resources, different objectives and different practices, and those of  
any one group and individual will develop over time. Although risk  
assessments at any one time can and should be based on current  
knowledge, a longer-term view should also be taken into account  
when assessing the desirable levels of protection against terrorism  
for a new building.  
The objective of counter-terrorism measures in buildings is  
to limit damage to the building fabric and injury to the occupants  
when an explosive device is detonated, and to limit the effec-  
tiveness of other forms of terrorist attack on the building and its  
occupants. They can serve either to reduce the probability of a suc-  
cessful attack or to reduce the consequences of an attack.  
# 4.1 Types of attack and levels of protection  
The major terrorist activity that impacts on the built environment is  
the use of improvised explosives devices \(IED\) in or near buildings **36-4 Security and counter-terrorism**  
that will cause damage to buildings and injury, possibly fatal injury,  
to occupants of the buildings and their surroundings.  
A wide range of IEDs have been used by terrorists. These  
include\:  
• Lorry bombs  
• Van or truck bombs  
• Car bombs  
• Suitcase bombs  
• Pedestrian suicide bombs as waistcoats or rucksacks  
• Fire bombs  
• Parcel bombs  
• Letter bombs.  
These show three basic forms of delivery\:  
• VBIED  
• Carried into place, generally inside a building, by a terrorist  
• Through third party delivery services such as mail and courier  
services.  
The counter-terrorist measures appropriate to reduce the hazard  
from these different forms of delivery are generally different, and  
combinations of measures are generally required to protect against  
all IED threats.  
At different locations and different times, the relative risk of  
the different forms of attack will vary, depending on the capabil-  
ity of the currently active terrorist organisations. In locations such  
as the UK where bulk explosives materials are not easily obtained  
and access to key ingredients in bulk quantities is controlled, ter-  
rorist organisations require high logistical expertise to create large  
VBIEDs. This is not so critical in locations where explosive mate-  
rials are readily available.  
Subject to these relative risks, VBIEDs present the largest ter-  
rorist hazard to buildings and their occupants, as they are capable  
of causing extensive damage and risk to occupants across whole  
buildings and multiple buildings, and are capable of causing major  
damage and extreme risk to a building in close proximity. Counter-  
terrorist measures to mitigate the consequences of VBIEDS may  
include\:  
• Hostile vehicle mitigation including barrier systems to keep  
vehicle bombs at a distance from the building  
• Location of delivery bays and visitor car parks to keep uncon-  
trolled vehicles as far as possible from the building, and  
particularly out of basements  
• Access control, moving blockers and search facilities for vehi-  
cles allowed to approach or enter  
• Avoidance of features in the building at exposed positions that  
will enhance the blast loading from an explosion, for example,  
re-entrant corners  
• Avoidance of features in the building at exposed positions that  
will reduce the strength, for example, transfer structures at first  
floor with widely spaced ground floor columns  
• Enhancement of the building structure, particularly at ground  
and first floor level, to limit structural damage and prevent dis-  
proportionate or progressive structural collapse  
• Choice of facade design to reduce glazing area on exposed  
facades  
• Enhancement of glazed facades to reduce the risk of hazardous  
glazing fragments in the building, and to reduce any blast pres-  
sures entering the building  
• Choice of layout within the building to place low occupancy  
spaces at the exposed perimeter as a buffer area to the high occu-  
pancy spaces  
• Preparation of shelter areas within the building into which occu-  
pants can be evacuated in the event of a warning of immanent  
threat, in conjunction with suitable means of warning.  
Smaller IEDs need to be closer to the building to cause a similar  
level of damage and hazard, and the damage will be more local-  
ised. Terrorists may try to detonate the IEDs inside the building, so  
visitor access control becomes critical. Counter-terrorist measures  
to mitigate the consequences of carried or worn IEDs may include\:  
• Staff entrance separate from visitor entrance with pass and PIN  
entry control to reduce numbers at risk from visitors  
• Visitor reception and inspection in a dedicated satellite block  
separate from, but linked, to the main building  
• Baggage and visitor search and scan facilities on entry  
• Multiple search and entry lanes with protection between to  
reduce numbers at risk  
• Design of satellite block to vent internal package explosion  
• Security guards and suitable procedures and training  
• Blast and fragment protection to guard and reception positions  
when not directly interacting with visitors  
• Pedestrian access with external approach channelled perpendic-  
ular to facades rather than against the facades  
• Avoid locations where packages can be concealed close to or  
against the ground floor facade  
• Avoid deep and/or flat external windowsills at ground floor level  
where packages can be left placed against glazing.  
Parcel or letter bombs may be delivered by innocent postal workers  
or couriers mixed up with innocent deliveries. Bulk scanning of  
mail and other deliveries and inspection of deliveries too large for  
the scanner is required if such devices are to be excluded from the  
building. Counter-terrorist measures to mitigate the consequences  
of delivered devices may include\:  
• Mail and delivery scanner located in the building  
• Scanner room on an external or courtyard face to vent internal  
blast outwards  
• Blast resistant container provided for suspect packages  
• Low occupancy buffer areas in rooms around the scanner room  
• Enhanced floor, walls, ceiling and door of the scanner room to  
avoid venting into the building  
• Mail and delivery scanning in a remote facility. This facility  
could serve more than one building. All deliveries to be made  
to the facility, and items to be transferred to the building after  
scanning in controlled vehicles only.  
Other common forms of attack include the use of IEDs against  
public transport such as planes, trains and buses or against private  
motor vehicles and the use of firearms or other weapons against  
people, whether in the street, in vehicles or in buildings. These may  
affect buildings as collateral damage, even though they were not  
targeted at the building or its occupants. In general, these are likely  
to be of less significance to the building design than a deliberate  
attack on the building, except for buildings that form part of the  
transport system such as airport terminals and railway stations.  
However, transportation threats may set a lower threshold for oth-  
erwise low risk buildings. For example, in the light of the London  
attacks in July 2007 it may be desirable to consider a pedestrian  
suicide bomb in the street as the minimum threat to be considered  
for any building on a bus route.  
Less common but not unknown are CBRN terrorist attacks.  
These are attacks on people using a vector carried usually in the air,  
but possibly also in the water supply. The building fabric will not  
be directly affected, but if the ventilation or water system has been  
used as a means of dispersion or distribution the contamination of  
the building may be a major problem.  
Military level CBRN protection uses special charcoal filters for  
incoming air and positive pressurisation, or complete closedown  
with oxygen supply and carbon dioxide scrubbers. Entry and exit is  
very restricted requiring airlock and decontamination facilities and  
special clothing. This is very expensive and disruptive, and is limited to a few  
specialist buildings. For most buildings in the public or private  
sector, full CBRN protection is not warranted. However, some  
precautions in the design of ventilation systems can reduce the  
vulnerability of a building without ensuring complete protection.  
These may include\:  
• Separate ventilation system for visitor reception  
• Separate ventilation system for mail scanner room  
• Dual air intakes at high and low level that can be closed from  
the security control room depending on CBRN attack vector –  
aircraft or ground released  
• Ventilation mode to pressurise building by increasing input fan  
and recirculation and reducing exhaust fan – to be implemented  
from security control room.  
The alternative choices, combinations and levels of counter-ter-  
rorist measures considered suitable for any particular building will  
depend on the risk assessment, the dual purpose measures that will  
be implemented anyway for other reasons, the available budget and  
the acceptability of the residual risks. It is not expected that all  
terrorist risks can be eliminated, but by prioritising the appropriate  
protective measures the overall residual risks can be minimised.  
Many protective measures will have little or no financial cost  
if they are incorporated from the start in the site masterplan and  
the building layout, but would be very expensive to implement at  
a later stage, either as a change in construction or a retrofit. Some  
active measures such as body and baggage search can be adjusted  
to match the current threat level, but only if provision for them has  
been made in the design, in the form of space and power supplies at  
the appropriate location in the visitor reception.  
Early consideration of counter-terrorism needs and the constraints  
that they may impose on other aspects of design is desirable to pro-  
duce a building with an appropriate and flexible level of protection.  
# 4.2 Blast loading on structures and facades  
Blast waves are shock waves in air initially travelling away from  
the source, and are caused by a sudden release of energy, for exam-  
ple by the detonation of a chemical explosive. The blast wave takes  
the form of an abrupt rise from atmospheric pressure to a peak  
pressure, and then a rapid but gradual reduction in pressure back  
to atmospheric pressure \(the positive phase\), followed by a longer  
period of reduced pressure that eventually returns to atmospheric  
pressure \(the negative phase\). The positive and negative impulses  
are the areas under the overpressure-time curve over the positive  
and negative phases respectively.  
The parameters of a blast wave depend on the quantity of blast  
energy; that is the mass of explosives, and the distance from the  
source. The parameters can be related to a unit charge using a  
scaling factor equal to the cube root of the explosives weight and  
evaluated for a given scaled range; that is the range divided by the  
scaling factor. For example, a charge eight times as big at twice the  
range will produce the same peak pressure over twice the time and  
hence produce twice the impulse.  
Different explosives materials release different energy, and so  
will produce different blast levels. These are often related to trinitro-  
toluene \(TNT\) as a ‘standard’ explosive. Many military explosives  
are more powerful than TNT, but many homemade explosives  
\(HME\) used in IEDs are sensitive to variations in manufacture, and  
can vary from failure to detonate at all to power greater than TNT.  
In many cases, a TNT equivalent of IEDs has been assessed from  
the extent of damage caused.  
As a shock wave expands from a detonation it interacts with  
obstructions, reflecting off exposed faces and refracting around  
corners to load non-exposed faces. A blast wave moving parallel  
to a face is not modified, but exerts a transient load equal to the  
pressure history on the face. Reflection of a blast wave from near  
perpendicular faces amplifies the pressures in the air against the  
# Security and counter-terrorism 36-5  
face, and hence the loading on the face. For intense shocks, the  
positive pressures can be amplified by reflection factors up to 8,  
but for weak shocks the reflection factor will be just over 2, and the  
reflection factor of the negative phase will be less than 2.  
For simple geometries of an air burst with no interaction before  
reaching the building, or a ground burst with interaction only with  
the ground, blast parameters can be interpolated by experienced blast  
engineers from accumulated blast trial data, using charts or simple  
computer programs. More complex streetscapes may include multi-  
ple and oblique reflections, refraction and clearing of reflected waves.  
Blast loading can be calculated numerically by an analyst modelling  
blast wave propagation in three dimensional models using Hydrocode  
or advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics \(CFD\) software.  
For counter-terrorist design, IED threats are commonly iden-  
tified as a TNT equivalent charge size at a given stand-off range.  
However, a common alternative approach is to specify a peak pos-  
itive pressure and impulse. For a simple geometry, including for  
blast trials of cladding, these will have a one-to-one correspond-  
ence with a ground burst charge size and stand-off range from  
a building. For analysis, the blast loadings are often simplified  
to a triangular pressure-time distribution and the negative phase  
ignored, although this may be conservative for some types of anal-  
ysis and cannot assess rebound reactions.  
For high-risk buildings that are likely to be a direct target, a  
security risk analysis should identify specific locations where dif-  
ferent charges might be placed, taking account of different security  
measures such as access control and hostile vehicle mitigation, and  
the building structure and facade can then be designed to provide an  
appropriate level of protection from these site specific blast threats.  
For lower-risk buildings where the probability of direct attack is  
small, some risks such as a lorry VBIED may not be designed  
against at the closest approach. Instead, design may be based on a  
generic threat level, say a car VBIED at 30 m, and the possibility of  
a larger charge at this range or this charge at a closer range can be  
accepted as a residual risk.  
The blast tests specified in BS EN ISO 16933 for arena blast  
testing of glass are increasingly being specified as generic threat  
levels, such as EXV25, with a peak pressure of 80 kPa and an  
impulse of 380 kPa.ms. This allows products that have been suc-  
cessfully tested to that level already to be offered for inclusion in  
the building without further blast testing.  
Typical reflected blast loading on large facades from ground  
bursts that might be specified for design of blast resistant facades  
are given in Table I.  
Threats would have to be significantly closer for these charges  
to be likely to cause failures of modern framed structures. Table II

shows the order of threats likely to cause limited damage to mod-  
ern structural frames not designed for blast resistance. Significant  
damage could be expected in non-framed buildings subject to this  
level of loading.  
Blast loading can be taken to fall into three types\:  
• Relatively small charges close-in have total loading times much  
shorter than the response times of the target structures and  
facades. These loadings are called impulsive, and the degree  
of damage is likely to be related to the net impulse. For small-  
scaled ranges the negative phase impulse will be substantially  
smaller than the positive phase impulse, and the net impulse will  
be a substantial proportion of the positive impulse. However,  
a larger charge at the same-scaled range will cause the same  
degree of damage over a larger area which will cause a greater  
extent of damage.  
• Very large charges at long ranges with positive phases much longer  
than the response time produce quasi-static loading where the  
damage is controlled by the peak pressure. However, this is more  
typical of petrochemical or distant nuclear explosions than IEDs.  
• Between these extreme cases are dynamic loadings where both  
the impulse and the peak pressure will influence the response  
and a dynamic analysis is required to determine the response.  
The negative loading may have a significant effect.  
In addition to the shock wave, a chemical explosion will produce  
an increase in air pressure due to the conversion of the explosives  
to gas and the heating of the air by the total energy of combus-  
tion, which is normally the combined energy of the shock wave  
and the afterburn that produces a fireball. In the open, this residual  
gas pressure dissipates rapidly and does not increase the loading on  
structures. However, if the explosion is confined, the residual gas  
pressure will vent slowly and will produce a quasi-static loading  
on the confining surfaces in addition to the blast loading, which in  
itself will be amplified by multiple reflections. Even with moderate  
opening areas to vent the gas the gas impulse may overcome the  
negative phase of the blast and produce a positive impulse several  
times the enhanced blast impulse. Open venting area equal to one  
full side of a cubic volume, that is, Volume2/3 is required for the gas  
pressure to dissipate as fast as the blast.  
This gas pressure, combined with the multiple blast reflections,  
can result in much increased structural damage from a charge  
that explodes internally compared to the same charge outside the  
building. This is the reason that uncontrolled vehicle entry into  
basements for parking or delivery should be avoided, and why visi-  
tor entry control and delivery scanners should be external, or on an  
external face to allow rapid venting.  
Design of a panel to resist external blast loading and yet to  
vent rapidly after an internal explosion is a careful balance using  
lightweight materials, and such a panel is likely to be substantially  
different from the normal building facade. Incorporating visitor  
entry or scanner rooms into the main structure will often require  
structural strengthening and compromises of appearance to main-  
tain safety.  
# 4.3 Structural robustness and disproportionate collapse  
Large charges close to a conventional building will overwhelm  
the closest facades, generally on the lowest floor or two, and will  
cause local damage to the structure, most commonly to one or more  
ground floor columns at the perimeter. The structural design of the  
building will determine whether the immediate blast damage is the  
total damage, or whether the loss of structural support will cause  
further structural failures in the building, resulting in a progressive  
collapse of part or all of the building that may be completely dis-  
proportionate to the original blast damage.  
Even large VBIEDS close outside modern multi-storey framed  
buildings will not normally cause immediate collapse due to blast  
loading. The loads are of very short duration and arrival times are  
staggered up the building. The mass of multiple floors is very large  
and will result in very limited overall response, often smaller than  
the sway expected in high-rise buildings from a three second gust  
wind loading. In general, bracing systems for substantial buildings  
do not need to be considered for blast, and even in lightweight build-  
ings with steel bracing the requirements are normally for stronger  
fixings rather than increased member strength. The large mass of  
the soil around foundations results in negligible blast response at  
ground level, and the effect of blast on foundations can be ignored  
provided the fixings of directly loaded members such as perimeter  
columns are adequate.  
In extreme cases, an internal detonation can demolish a sub-  
stantial building, as was the case for the US Marine Barracks in  
Beirut in October 1983, where a 5.4 tonne TNT equivalent VBIED  
entered the building before detonating, causing complete collapse  
and 241 fatalities. However, this can best be prevented by hostile  
vehicle mitigation to keep vehicles at a distance, designing out  
basement delivery bays and car parks close to loadbearing structure  
and entry control and inspection of vehicles that are allowed past  
the perimeter. Structural design to resist a major internal explosion  
is not likely to be an economic solution.  
Disproportionate collapse of all or part of a building risks a  
major increase in fatalities and serious injuries, above those caused  
directly by the blast, and so is unacceptable. There are three main  
routes to avoid progressive collapse, often applied in combination\:  
• Prevent local failure of the structure, for example by increasing  
stand-off from explosions or designing the ground floor columns  
to resist the blast loading without failure \(although not necessar-  
ily without damage\).  
• Provide alternative load paths in the structure that can support  
the upper structure even if one or several adjacent ground floor  
columns are removed by analysing the structure with columns  
removed.  
• Use prescriptive rules in structural Codes of Practice that are  
intended to provide alternative load paths in a damaged struc-  
ture, that is, tying rules.  
The robustness of a building is its insensitivity to local failure,  
which is provided by the second and third routes. The standards  
for robustness in British buildings were set following the collapse  
of a full height corner of the 22-storey Ronan Point in May 1968  
following a domestic gas explosion on the eighteenth floor, with  
four fatalities. These standards are incorporated into UK Building  
Regulations, and means of satisfying these standards have been  
incorporated into structural Codes of Practice. They are aimed at  
general robustness rather than specifically at bomb blast loading.  
Similar rules have been adopted in many other countries.  
Loadbearing masonry buildings without vertical ties are inher-  
ently less robust because breach of the weakest parts of the facade  
\(i.e. doors and windows\) and blast entry causes uplift of the floors  
and roof, which removes lateral support to the loadbearing walls,  
allowing them to displace so that they cannot support the floors and  
roof against gravity afterwards. This is illustrated by the complete  
collapse of St Ethelbura’s church 70 m from a one tonne bomb in  
Bishopsgate, London in April 1993, while framed buildings nearer  
to the detonation remained standing, even with column damage,  
and were reparable. Loadbearing masonry construction should be  
avoided for high-risk buildings.  
Because attack by VBIEDs will normally only occur at street  
level, some additional measures can be applied to enhance robust-  
ness of framed buildings under bomb blast loading. These are\:  
• Design the first floor slab and beams for reversal of gravity floor  
loading due to blast entering the ground floor and lifting the floor.  
• Provide enhanced shear reinforcement at closer centres in perim-  
eter ground floor columns to make the columns more ductile and  
less likely to fail catastrophically by shear. • Provide main bracing systems for the building distributed in plan  
so that only part of the bracing system in any direction can be  
damaged by close proximity to a VBIED.  
With the exception of increasing the stand-off, most of this is  
the work of the structural engineer or a specialist blast engineer.  
However, these requirements should inform the architect’s design,  
which should not work against them. For example, the use of a  
transfer structure at first floor level and fewer ground floor columns  
in the Alfred Murrah Building in Oklahoma reduced the alternative  
load paths, without the remaining columns being capable to resist  
blast loading. Failure of two or three adjacent ground floor columns  
on one face of the building under bomb blast in April 1995 resulted  
in a substantial part of the building collapsing with 168 fatalities.  
# 4.4 Blast resistance of facades  
The primary concern for blast resistance of facades is to prevent  
fragments of glass entering the building and injuring people.  
Monolithic annealed window glass is the weakest part of any build-  
ing facade, breaks easily into jagged fragments and is ubiquitous in  
the built environment. As a result, glass fragments are the greatest  
source of injury in a blast in a built-up area. Glazing injuries can  
occur for hundreds of metres around a VBIED explosion, while  
other incidents may cause structural damage and direct blast inju-  
ries occur only within tens of metres of the explosion.  
There are two possible solutions to the risk of glass fragments  
caused by blast. The first is to design the glazing not to break.  
However, for IED explosions this can result in very thick glazing  
that causes very high reaction forces on the window frame, which  
requires very strong structural supports back to the building frame.  
This may result in uneconomic facades that are not a realistic  
option for most buildings. This approach is normally required for  
quasi-static blast loads such as petrochemical explosions, but the  
low peak pressures make this design economic.  
In-plane reactions from uncracked glass are small, so gasket,  
silicone and glazing tape bonding are all suitable, but the inwards  
and rebound reactions are very high, so the frames have to be very  
strong. One-way spanning glass is less stiff and deflects further  
before cracking, and so may be beneficial for an uncracked design.  
Bolted laminated glass systems have little strength at the  
concentrated supports after cracking, so bolted systems should  
be designed to remain uncracked under blast loading. However,  
bolted glazing systems will be substantially weaker than edge  
supported glazing, and are generally not recommended for blast  
resistant glazing.  
The alternative solution is to design glazing that retains the  
glass fragments after the glass cracks. For new construction, this  
can best be provided by using a polyvinyl butyral \(PVB\) lami-  
nated glass inner leaf in the glazing system, adequately anchored  
to the frame. Under blast loading the inner leaf cracks and the  
PVB interlayer stretches, adsorbing energy and catching the  
fragments of the outer leaf if double glazing is used. This results  
in a lower reaction over a longer period that is easier for the  
frame and supports to resist, together with an in-plane reaction  
that tries to pull the glazing from the frame, so anchorage of the  
glazing into the frame is important to generate the full resistance  
of the laminated glass.  
A similar behaviour is possible with application of anti-shatter  
film on the inside of existing glazing, but the limited possibilities  
for anchorage of the film and the limited strength of frames not  
designed to resist the reactions tends to limit the performance to the  
lower levels of blast protection. Unanchored anti-shatter film has  
frequently been applied to existing glazing and affords a limited  
enhancement in protection, mostly by bringing the velocity of glass  
fragments down to the mean velocity and reducing the exposure  
of sharp points and edges. The acrylic adhesives are degraded by  
ultra-violet light, so modern anti-shatter film has a useful life of  
about 10 to 15 years depending on exposure.  
# Security and counter-terrorism 36-7  
The outer leaf of a double glazed unit can be annealed, heat  
strengthened or toughened glass. The choice may have some effect  
on blast resistance, but will not be critical provided the inner leaf is  
laminated, as debris from a failed outer leaf can ride on the inner leaf  
and be expelled when the inner leaf rebounds. The choice of glass  
type is likely to be driven by other considerations like impact resist-  
ance, thermal shock or security against intrusion. Laminated glass  
can also be used in the outer leaf, but the performance of the PVB  
interlayers against blast may be reduced by high temperatures in the  
outer leaf, particularly if the glazing included thermal coatings.  
Blast resistance is not fully standardised, so design threats tend  
to be site or client specific. Minimum standard threat levels for low  
risk UK government buildings are covered by recipe designs, with  
6 mm toughened outer glazing and 6.8 mm thick laminated glass in  
conventionally designed metal frames. For more severe blast lev-  
els, blast testing or dynamic analysis informed by blast testing is  
the norm, using laminated glass with at least a 1.5 mm thick PVB  
interlayer and solid gaskets at least 30 mm deep or structural sili-  
cone at least 20 mm deep to anchor the glass in the frame. Fragility  
curves for a range of glass construction have been created by the  
Home Office for panes supported along all four edges. Derived  
from extensive testing, these are based on only two sizes of window  
pane, but provide an initial idea of performance. Glass is expected  
to crack, but the vast majority of fragments are expected to remain  
bonded to the interlayer. The interlayer will stretch as it deflects,  
adsorbing energy and slowing the response. Laminated glass has  
been demonstrated to deflect up to 32 per cent of the shorter span  
under blast loading without failure.  
Gasket systems hold cracked laminated glass in position by  
framing and/or cover plates on both faces while a compression ring  
forms in the cracked glass to resist the tension in the PVB inter-  
layer. This is only possible with support on all four edges of a glass  
pane. For windows of about 2 m2 in size and aspect ratios up to  
about 1.5, blast tests have shown that stiff gaskets 30 mm deep will  
always provide adequate support and some systems with 25 mm  
deep gaskets may also be adequate. However, deeper gaskets and  
frame bites may be required for larger panes or higher aspect ratios.  
Gasket support of cracked glass is not amenable to calculation, and  
so needs to be demonstrated by blast testing.  
Some structural silicones have been subjected to high strain rate  
laboratory testing that allows the strength of silicone anchorages  
to be calculated. Suitable silicone depths start from about 20 mm.  
Silicone supports are not sensitive to the size or aspect ratio of the  
glass, but are sensitive to the total thickness of PVB in the glaz-  
ing make-up. Silicone can be used to provide single sided support  
against blast loading, but the silicone will also have to be designed  
for long-term support of the glass weight.  
Blast trials of silicone attached curtain walling underpin the  
design approach, but new tests are not necessarily required for dif-  
ferent cases.  
Structural silicone can be used to support cracked one-way span-  
ning laminated glass against blast loading on two opposite edges.  
However, slender glass plies must be avoided as they can cause fail-  
ure of the silicone before the last ply cracks. Some modern glazing  
tapes at 25 mm width have been successfully tested to support glaz-  
ing against moderate blast levels, but this is still under development  
and designs will currently need to be verified by testing.  
For single windows piercing a stronger facade \(e.g. masonry\),  
frame enhancement only requires an increased bite to anchor the  
glazing and adequate fixings to resist the reaction and the in-plane  
tension in the PVB interlayer. For multi-panel windows or curtain  
walling, the transoms and mullions that span between supports will  
also require either to be designed dynamically for reaction from  
the glazing or proven by blast trials, but plastic deformation is per-  
mitted. Loadbearing structural supports of multi-bay glazing, such  
as columns that support the facade and roof, may also require to  
be designed dynamically for glazing reaction or blast loading, but  
should remain elastic. **36-8 Security and counter-terrorism**  
Multi-bay glazing may be supported by a non-loadbearing sec-  
ondary structure back to the main structure. When this works purely  
in bending it can be designed by dynamic analysis and allowed to  
undergo plastic yielding. However, some structures are designed to  
work as a truss with axially loaded members, or as a mixed system  
with both axial and bending forces on the members. These must  
be designed to remain elastic under the blast loading, and buck-  
ling of compressive members will need to be considered. Static  
buckling capacity limits are conservative but can be applied to lin-  
ear dynamic analysis. Dynamic buckling assessment will require a  
nonlinear transient analysis, which is very onerous. Specialist blast  
design advice should be sought as early as possible.  
Where vulnerable supports such as glass fins or external fins  
prone to lateral-torsional buckling are used to support blast resistant  
glazing against normal loading, it may be necessary to incorporate  
secondary support systems such as cables to provide an alternative  
support path under blast loading. These in turn may impose large  
concentrated reactions on the building structure locally. Specialist  
blast design advice should be sought as early as possible.  
Blast glazing design and materials are still developing rapidly,  
and various alternative solutions such as polycarbonate or glass  
clad polycarbonate glazing, ionoplast interlayers and cast plastic  
glazing materials are at different levels of development, experience  
and acceptability. Most of these are significantly more expen-  
sive than PVB laminated glass, and have additional issues such  
as deeper bites or larger reaction forces that need to be resolved.  
Specialist blast design advice should be sought before any of these  
alternatives are proposed.  
Masonry facades are less vulnerable to blast than most glazing,  
but tend to resist blast primarily by inertia rather than strength. For a  
pressure high enough to crack the masonry, increasing impulse lev-  
els will cause more damage up to the collapse threshold. Injury can  
be caused by falling masonry debris even at low velocities. Some  
indicative capacities at the threshold of failure for brickwork or  
dense concrete blockwork are shown in Table III for well-supported  
storey height masonry panels. There will be significant variation  
around these values for panel sizes, support conditions and window  
openings. Lightweight blockwork will be more vulnerable.  
Facades of precast concrete cladding or structural reinforced  
concrete walls behind architectural cladding can be designed to  
resist substantially greater blast loading on a case-by-case basis,  
and should be the preferred choices where close-in VBIEDs are an  
expected threat, such as at vehicle entry control facilities. These  
facades can also offer substantial resistance to entrance of primary  
fragments from the device and secondary fragments of the delivery  
vehicle.  
# 4.5 Blast testing of glazing  
Blast testing of glazing systems is common, using either an explosives  
charge in front of a glazing unit \(arena testing\) or a focused shock  
wave created in a shock tube either by a small quantity of explosives  
or by compressed air and a bursting membrane. The standards on  
Arena and Shock tube testing, ISO 16933 and ISO 16934 strictly  
speaking cover testing of standard sized glazing in a frame of stand-  
ard detail. In practice, the pressure and impulse combinations from  
these standards are also applied to systems of various sizes made  
with proprietary systems, and the fragment hazard. Threats in arena  
tests that represent VBIEDS are given in Table IV, while threats that  
represent package bombs are given in Table V. Comparable but not  
identical sets of tests apply to shock tube tests.

These arena tests are designed to be conducted using charges of  
no more than 100 kg TNT equivalent so that they can be conducted  
at any trial site licensed for that quantity of explosives. The number  
in the classification code represents the approximate stand-off in  
metres for a 100 kg TNT charge to produce the listed loading on a  
standard test sample mounted on the front of a 3 m × 3 m testing  
cubicle.  
The reduction in impulse due to clearing around the edges of  
the support structure is taken into account in these values, so the  
same pressure/impulse combination would be produced by a differ-  
ent sized charge at a different range in front of a large facade with  
no clearing. However the loading at short range is impulsive so the  
damage is representative of that produced by a similar impulse but  
lower pressure produced by a larger charge at greater range.  
The EXV 45 test was included to assess non-anchored anti-  
shatter film, and is not normally used to assess laminated glazing.  
Because the package bombs will be at close range to smaller  
parts of a building facade, the fragment threat applies to smaller  
numbers of people and they therefore represent lower risks. It is  
rarely economically justified to undertake both VBIED and pack-  
age IED testing for the same facade.  
Shock tubes can produce an approximately triangular pres-  
sure-time history closely resembling the positive phase of a blast  
wave, but cannot produce a significant negative blast wave. They  
are therefore suitable either for impulsive short duration tests where  
the shock tube impulse can be compared to the net impulse from  
a charge at a low scale range, or long duration loading approach-  
ing quasi-static, where the peak response will occur before the end  
of the positive phase. They are least suited for the intermediate  
dynamic blast tests where the timing of the negative phase in a real  
blast will have a significant effect on the results.  
Shock tubes generate a focused shock wave over a limited  
aperture. The equipment is more complex than for arena tests but  
requires less space. The number of shock tubes capable of emu-  
lating IED and VBIED blast over an aperture large enough to accommodate whole windows is small world wide, and there are  
currently none in the UK. The largest apertures are currently 3 m ×  
3 m, which cannot test full storey height glazing units.  
In contrast, there are support structures available for arena  
tests that can support storey high curtain wall units or multi-bay  
test facades up to about 10 m high and 20+ m long. Damage is  
assessed in terms of fragment positions inside the testing cubicle  
with a Styrofoam witness panel to intercept fragments 3 m behind  
the glazing, as listed in Table VI.  
BS EN 13123\:2004 and the DIN \(German\) standard from which  
it was derived have effectively been superseded by the ISO stand-  
ards, but some existing test results may be based on it. The tests  
EXR1 to EXR5 closely resemble tests SB3 to SB7, but the hazard  
rating approach is different.  
The ASTM F 1642 test specification is based on a late draft of  
the ISOs and contains effectively the same tests, but requires three  
tests for a certificate and has small but significant differences in the  
definitions of the hazard ratings. Some tests may also be aimed at  
meeting the US GSA blast standards. For these, the pressure-im-  
pulse combinations are different and may require a larger charge,  
but the hazard rating is similar in principle but different in defini-  
tion and nomenclature.  
Most common are Arena tests to the EXV vehicle bomb test  
standards that are representative of 100 kg TNT charges at stand-  
off ranges between 45 m and 10 m from the sample. If the required  
level of protection for a building is specified, such as to meet  
EXV25\(E\), then manufacturers can provide reports on systems  
that achieved this performance in test, can test their systems to this  
standard or can provide dynamic analyses to demonstrate that their  
proposed systems should meet this performance.  
The performance of a glazing system will depend on the size  
and proportions of the panes, so test results need to be for samples  
of a similar size. Test results for isolated windows are fairly com-  
mon, and for panels with a mixture of opening lights or doors and  
fixed lights are available, but test results for storey height curtain  
wall panels are much rarer, as the test samples become more expen-  
sive to manufacture and support.  
Tests for multi-storey, multi-bay facades have been conducted  
for a few facade designs. These are very expensive and primarily

evaluate the supporting structure rather than the glazing units. For  
most facades, the supporting structure can be evaluated by analysis  
so these tests are normally only considered for unusual supporting  
systems.  
# 4.6 Bomb shelter areas and buffer zones  
It is usually impractical to design a building to provide complete  
protection from all feasible terrorist blast threats, so most buildings  
leave a residual risk for occupants from the whole range of ter-  
rorist attacks. However, not all parts of a building will be equally  
vulnerable.  
In the event of a warning of an imminent attack, the overall  
risk of injury and fatality can be minimised if the occupants of the  
building are temporarily moved to the least vulnerable parts of the  
building. This inwards evacuation of a building in the event of a  
bomb warning is more appropriate in the first instance than an out-  
wards evacuation of a building, which could take people into greater  
danger, particularly when the location of the bomb is still unknown.  
Locations in a building identified or created as areas of low vul-  
nerability are referred to as bomb shelter areas or protected spaces.  
In offices and similar buildings it is recommended that sufficient  
shelter areas are identified or created to accommodate all the build-  
ing occupants temporarily and an inwards evacuation strategy be  
developed and practised, comparable to the fire evacuation strategy.  
UK government recommendations for shelter areas include\:  
• 0.6 m2 of floor area per person expected to use that shelter, but  
greater preferred  
• Ideally at least one per floor, but with maximum 90 m travel  
distance from any point  
• Reasonable access to toilet facilities \(toilets can be part of the  
shelter area\)  
• Reasonable access to normal escape routes  
• Shelter areas can include staircases at 1.0 m2 per person, but  
some unobstructed staircases desirable  
• Provision of adequate ventilation, perhaps by activation of  
smoke extract ventilation for shelter areas in enclosed spaces  
• PA from control room \(also to shelter area standard\) and tele-  
phone feedback  
• Located in the most robust parts of the building, ideally within  
solid internal walls or blast enhanced partitions  
• Remote from\:  
 Extensive glazed elevations  
 External doors  
 Underground car parks  
 Gas and fuel lines and bulk storage  
 Areas prone to progressive collapse  
 Top floors under weak roof construction  
 Areas exposed to high blast and direct fragment hazard.  
• Ideally, shelter areas should provide protection levels of\:  
 Internal pressures less than 35 kPa \(eardrum rupture threshold\)  
 Doors to withstand a blast impulse of 450 kPa.ms  
 Glazing fragment hazard less than high hazard  
 Shielded against perforation by primary fragments of the  
bomb and secondary fragments from the vehicle  
 No structural collapse and protected from falling debris.  
In many cases, areas that cannot offer the full specification will still  
afford substantial protection and are often termed deficient shelter  
areas. For example, in open plan offices the enclosed areas of toi-  
lets, staircases, lift lobbies and kitchens will often not offer enough  
area behind walls or partitions that resist fragments.  
However, with a deep floor plate, the core open plan area can  
be substantially protected from fragments from an explosion on the  
ground. The fragments penetrate at a rising angle, and fast fragments  
hit the ceiling, while slow fragments fall back to the floor before pen-  
etrating deeply. Similarly, for buildings with road access only at the **36-10 Security and counter-terrorism**  
front, open plan area behind the core but remote from the rear glazing  
may also be protected from fragments, even on the ground floor.  
These areas may provide adequate shelter areas even though not  
enclosed. Glass walled meeting rooms in such locations may also  
be adequate provided the glazing is either laminated or toughened  
and fitted with anti-shatter film. Shelter areas are only of use if a  
suitable warning will be received and acted upon in the event of an  
immediate bomb risk. A number of police forces offer a warning  
service by automated messaging services to subscribing building  
managers. Procedures then need to be in place to call for an inwards  
evacuation when a valid warning is received.  
In the 1980s and 1990s, many bomb attacks were aimed at dam-  
age and disruption rather than fatalities, and bomb warnings by  
the terrorists were common. Now that the risk of suicide VBIEDs  
without warning is significant, police would need to have warnings  
from their intelligence sources that a bomb was in play and have  
a good idea of its target to call a warning in the vicinity. In these  
circumstances, the benefits of shelter areas are reduced.  
An alternative approach for high-risk buildings is to provide  
buffer zones on the vulnerable periphery of the building, effec-  
tively turning most of the building into a large protected space. A  
wall or secure partition at the back of the buffer zone can provide  
additional blast protection and protection from bomb fragments  
and high hazard glass fragments if the main facade is overloaded.  
Depending on the circumstances, the buffer zone may be  
unused dead space, sacrificed to give enhanced protection, could  
be used as unoccupied window display space, or could be filled  
with low occupancy spaces such as toilets, storerooms, plant rooms  
and service risers. These will provide both an increased stand-off of  
the occupied spaces from the charge, and space behind the visible  
facade to provide additional lines of protection to attenuate close-in  
blast affects, for example from a VBIED in the street immediately  
outside. This concept may have significant benefits in refurbishing  
existing buildings to enhance resistance to attack.  
For high threat environments, this concept can also be used to plan  
new inherently protected buildings. One example would be inwards  
facing courtyard buildings, with a shallow layer of low occupancy  
rooms around the outside perimeter and a circulation corridor between  
these and the main occupied spaces around the courtyard. The exter-  
nal facade would require only moderate glazing area, giving a less  
vulnerable facade, and the two corridor wall lines could be used to  
provide additional protection around the occupied space. The court-  
yard facades would be loaded only by indirect blast refracting over  
the building, and could be extensively clad with blast resistant glazing.

# 6 SOURCES OF ADVICE  
The Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\) is a UK  
government authority which provides protective security advice  
to businesses and organisations across the national infrastructure.  
Their advice aims to reduce the vulnerability of the national infra-  
structure and crowded places to terrorism and other threats \(www.  
cpni.gov.uk\).  
The National Counter Terrorism Security Office \(NaCTSO\)  
is a police unit co-located with CPNI. It trains Police CTSAs and  
the Argus Professional initiative to raise awareness of designing in  
counter-terrorism measures at the design stage. Its website includes  
general sector related guidance \(www.nactso.gov.uk\).  
Police Counter Terrorism Security Advisors \(CTSA\) identify  
and assess local critical sites within their force area that might be  
vulnerable to terrorist attack; then devise and develop appropriate  
protective security plans to minimise impact on that site and the  
surrounding community. Architectural Liaison Officers \(ALO\)  
or Crime Prevention Design Advisors \(CPDA\) provide advice  
on crime prevention through the built environment to planners,  
developers, designers, builders, landlords and estate and facility  
managers. They will refer you to a CTSA if necessary. They can  
be contacted via your local police force websites or through www.

The Register of Security Engineers and Specialists \(RSES\)  
is sponsored by CPNI and maintained by the Institution of Civil  
Engineers. The register lists experts who are able to provide a  
range of advice from initial risk assessment, potential design  
considerations and solutions, to design detailing and testing in

# Physical security concepts and standards  
Fences and walls Fencing may be used either round a property boundary, or to  
enclose specific buildings/areas within a larger site. The  
function of fencing falls into two general categories –  
\(a\) demarcation of property boundary only OR  
\(b\) Security fencing which provides levels of delay against  
forced entry/intrusion.  
Note walls should be regarded as equivalent to fencing, and  
should specified in terms of height and anti-climb requirements  
Doorsets Doorsets can be specified to provide security protection against –  
• Physical/manual attack  
• Ballistics  
• Blast  
Define the requirements for each of the above security criteria, to  
achieve an attack time equivalent to walls and glazing for the  
structure.  
Security ratings for doorsets should apply where required to  
passive leaves and overpanels/sidepanels.  
Surveillance  
CCTV Closed Circuit Television \(CCTV\) can be utilised to provide  
surveillance and recording of areas of a client property.  
CCTV can provide a number of different functions dependent  
upon client requirement including the following\:  
• Surveillance live monitoring of all images  
• Surveillance and recording \(for post incident purposes\)  
• Event triggered displays using CCTV to provide images of  
areas where intrusion is detected.  
Define whether the fence is required to demarcate site boundary  
OR meet a rated security standard.  
Where security fencing is proposed consider anti-climb and anti-  
burrowing solutions.  
Where anti-climb is applied minimum height requirements apply  
Planning Consent is a key constraint particularly when in close  
proximity to residential areas  
Consider Equality Act requirements e.g. vision panels/automation  
while ensuring security rating is not reduced  
Consider emergency exit/panic exit requirements based on area  
occupancy.  
For any oversized doorsets \(particularly loading bays etc.\) LPCB  
ratings will be based on systems tested to a maximum size so  
note that oversized doorsets may not achieve accreditation.  
Define the function and therefore required image size and resolution  
for each individual camera based on the functional requirement i.e.\:  
• Identification 100%R  
• Recognition 50%R  
• Observation 25%R  
• Detection 10%R  
• Monitoring 5%R  
Define the period for which images should be retained.  
Assess and define preference for Internet Protocol based or  
analogue CCTV solutions \(specifically considering impact on  
LAN bandwidth and resilience\)  
Define early in the design process whether site lighting will  
be used for CCTV purposes, so that general lighting design  
allows for CCTV requirements. Alternatively specify suitable  
illumination to support CCTV, and compatible cameras.  
Establish all data protection requirements applying to CCTV in  
the environment. Confirm the system function with the client’s  
data controller

Intruder detection Intruder Detection Systems \(IDS\) can be used to provide  
detection and reporting of intruders either to off-site  
monitoring agencies OR to local security personnel on site.  
IDS can provide detection and verification of intrusions either  
as a stand-alone system; operating in conjunction with CCTV  
to provide a ‘visual confirmation’ solution; or as part of a site  
wide fully integrated solution.  
Perimeter detection  
Search and scanning Search and scanning equipment is used to assist in the detection  
equipment of weapons, explosives or chemical, biological or radiological  
material. Such material could be concealed on the person,  
in bags or sent via the mail or courier systems. Search and  
detection options are\:  
A visual search  
Hand held search ‘wands’  
Passage through metal detecting arch  
X ray of packages and cases  
Body scanning  
Explosive scanning  
CBR scanning  
Vehicle and truck scanning  
Confirm whether the IDS is required to initiate police attendance.  
Confirm the grading of system required, i.e. 1–4 dependent on  
the nature of the property and assets.  
Where buildings require Listed Building Consent, full installation  
details including equipment types, method of installation,  
disturbance to building fabric, and any enabling works \(cable  
routes etc.\) should all be defined at design stage.  
Search and scanning will normally occur in reception areas,  
shipping and receiving areas or in designated mail/scanner  
rooms. Specialist advice should be sought on current  
technologies and equipment capabilities  
When designing such areas, considerations are\:  
• The size of the search equipment.  
• Whether it is to be permanent, temporary or occasional  
• Visual screening of personnel search areas  
• Requirements for blast enhanced mail scanning rooms  
• Containment, particularly where temporary equipment may be  
required in foyer and reception areas.

# 2.2 Scale  
Sports facilities come in many different shapes and sizes, from  
a sandpit in a park where a casual game of petanque is played,  
through a small community tennis club, a local authority sports  
centre, school or university facilities, regional racecourse, foot-  
ball league stadium, to a national stadium or even an international  
‘sports city’. The design of these facilities clearly changes in scope  
and complexity but this chapter should provide the basis for the  
core facilities that relate to most if not all.  
# 2.3 Sporting places  
The places where sport can occur are virtually limitless.  
Competitions take place upon the ocean waves, alpine pass roads  
and the tarmac of city centres; on turf and dirt as well as the pre-  
pared surfaces of a tennis court or bowling green. Some of these  
places are not designed at all, except to locate key points along a  
route, and some require meticulous design work. The chapter pro-  
vides the dimensional considerations for the sports that require the  
intervention of a designer.  
# 1 HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER  
Sports facilities take many forms but this chapter provides guidance  
for their technical design whether they are used for competition,  
training or recreation. The guidance is set out starting with the key  
dimensional data of the field of play for each sport, followed by  
principles to be applied to the design of viewing structures, and  
lastly the accommodation for the various users of the facility. A  
comprehensive reference bibliography is included at the end of the  
chapter as this field of design is technically complex. However,  
because it evolves from year to year, designers should consult the  
latest guidance from the governing body of each sport, and other  
regulatory and guidance frameworks.  
# 2 GENERAL INTRODUCTION  
# 2.1 Indoor and outdoor facilities  
Design information related to sports facilities is documented here  
in a single chapter irrespective of whether the sport is conducted  
inside or outside. The authors have concluded that the many factors  
that influence the design of a sports facility are relevant for both.  
That is not to say that the conditions are identical and of course the  
design of appropriate finishes and the design of mechanical and  
electrical services must be carefully considered to ensure the facil-  
ity is fit for purpose. Roofs can also play a key role in the design of  
sports facilities and they are discussed in Section 4.9.

# 3 FIELD OF PLAY  
# 3.1 Definition  
This section introduces the concept that all sports are conducted on  
a field of play, whether that is a pitch, track, course, pool, field or  
court. The governing body for each sport will generally define the  
dimensional requirements for this, which may vary depending on  
the level of competition. Dimensions for the field of play for most  
sports can be grouped into categories.  
# 3.2 Pitch/park/ground  
The first category illustrated here, Figures 37.1–37.10, are sports  
that are conducted on a level surface that would have been origi-  
nally turfed, but at the professional level, the surfaces are becoming  
increasingly sophisticated. They are all team sports and can be  
played in a local park or in an international stadium. They are most  
commonly played outdoors, although indoor facilities exist for  
some.  
# 3.3 Track  
The second category of sports is conducted on a track, sometimes  
in individual competition and sometimes as team events, Figures  
37.11–37.15\. The dimensions of the tracks for athletics and track  
cycling are standardised to a degree although some degree of  
variation is permitted, whereas the tracks for BMX racing and  
motor-sport are all different.  
# 3.4 Court  
Sports that are played on courts of various different configurations  
can be played both indoors or outdoors and often on a number of  
different surfaces, Figures 37.16–37.23.  
# 3.5 Pool  
Pool-based sports are obviously conducted in standard length swim-  
ming pools, although their widths do vary, Figures 37.24–37.28.  
The pools are increasingly more sophisticated with moving floors  
to increase their usability by participants of varying competence.

into categories. Some require a ring, some a mat, others a range,  
green, lawn or table, Figures 37.34–37.45.

# 3.9 Compatibility  
Within certain dimensional ranges, a number of surfaces are capa-  
ble of accommodating a number of these sports, subject to changes  
to markings. Some surfaces can display the markings of more than  
one sport subject to appropriately coloured markings being used  
to clearly distinguish one from another. It is quite common for the  
multi-sports hall of a school or local authority sports centre to be  
marked out to accommodate tennis, five-a-side football, basketball,  
netball, volleyball and badminton.  
One of the great advantages of a modern indoor arena such  
as the O2 Arena in London is their flexibility to accommodate a  
number of different events, Figure 37.46. It is possible to design  
the field of play to be transformable between ice hockey, bas-  
ketball, netball, tennis, boxing, badminton, gymnastics or even  
dressage.  
International stadia are increasingly being designed to accom-  
modate a number of sports that can attract large crowds, including  
football \(soccer, American football and Australian football\), rugby  
\(both codes\), athletics and cricket, Figure 37.47. The transforma-  
tion of the field of play can take many forms and is discussed in  
Section 4.8.  
**37.46** *O2 Arena field of play configurations*  
# 3.10 Playing surface  
Sports are played on a vast array of different surfaces from simple  
sand, for beach volleyball and petanque, through turf of varying com-  
plexity to quite sophisticated sprung timber floors for indoor courts.  
*Natural turf*  
Considerable research has been conducted into sports turf, in order  
to provide the appropriate specification for the intended purpose.  
This includes the species of grass, the growing medium build-up,  
flexible reinforcement to aid longevity but protect players, irri-  
gation systems and under-pitch heating to maintain appropriate  
playing conditions around the calendar. Consideration also needs  
to be given to the health of the grass, which requires, for good sus-  
tainable growth both wind and natural light, sometimes supported  
by artificial means. Reseeded every year, rye grass courts are still  
used in the UK and some other parts of the world for tennis, notably  
for the Queens and Wimbledon tournaments. Grass courts are gen-  
erally the fastest type of court surface with the least bounce, which  
has historically favoured the serve and volley style of play.  
*Artificial grass*  
All-weather pitches laid with artificial grass, made from synthetic,  
often polyethylene, fibres made to look like natural grass are  
becoming increasingly common in order to reduce the maintenance **Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-23**  
**37.47** *Diagram showing rugby, football, cricket and athletics overlaid*  
required for natural turf and guarantee playability throughout the  
year. Most pitch-based sports can be played on artificial grass,  
including football although some tournaments prevent their use.  
Artificial grass surfaces provide a consistency and flatness which  
is particularly suitable for field hockey and for cricket nets, and  
of course because neither sunlight nor irrigation is required, are  
especially suitable indoors.  
*Rubberised surfaces*  
The fastest athletics tracks have a natural or synthetic rubber  
surface, which can be applied in long strips or as a homogenous  
surface on top of a tarmac sub-base. This gives a sprung feel, which  
is supportive to the athletes’ efforts and less damaging to their bod-  
ies. Similar surfaces can be applied to sports halls and the like and  
are suitable for a range of pitch and court sports.  
*Timber floors*  
Indoor halls are often fitted out with a timber playing surface, sprung  
to protect the participants, making them suitable for a range of sports  
such as gymnastics, tennis, netball, squash, badminton and so on.  
They are typically constructed on a screeded sub-floor using 22 mm  
solid timber board nailed or clipped to a batten system laid on a resil-  
ient underlay. Timber species include beech, maple and ash.  
Although velodrome tracks have historically been constructed  
from a variety of materials including concrete and cinder, modern  
indoor velodrome tracks are usually constructed from pine. The  
track at the velodrome in the Queen Elizabeth Park in London was  
constructed using Siberian pine because the trees are known for  
being straight and tall making them suitable for the lengths of tim-  
ber required to shape the track; and the extreme Siberian climate  
also means the timber is very stable and will not shrink or contract  
in the environmental conditions of the velodrome.  
*Other tennis surfaces*  
There are four surfaces used for professional tennis competitions\:  
grass courts \(discussed earlier\), clay courts, hard courts and carpet  
courts. Clay courts are made from crushed shale, stone or brick,  
can be either red or green and are common in Europe and South  
America. Red clay, slower than the green, is used for the French  
Open at Roland Garros. Clay surfaces tend to be slower than others  
resulting in less dominance of the server during the game. Hard  
courts can be acrylic or synthetic with a painted surface contain-  
ing sand. They are generally between grass and clay in terms of  
speed and bounce. Hard courts are used for the Australian Open in  
Melbourne and US Open at Flushing Meadows, and are common  
throughout the world. Short artificial grass weighed down with  
sand is a removable carpet court and is common in Asia. Indoor  
courts are normally hard courts although when tennis is played in  
a multi-event arena, a rubberised carpet is laid on the arena floor.  
At lower levels of the game, tarmac surfaces are cheaper low  
maintenance substitutes.  
# 3.11 Field of play orientation  
There are general ‘rules of thumb’ and sometimes regulations for the  
orientation of outdoor pitches, particularly those that are designed  
for spectators and television coverage, Figure 37.48. Generally, for  
**37.48** *Field of play orientation* **37-24 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
temperate climate situations, locating the long axis of the pitch in a  
north-south orientation is preferred with a 15 degree tolerance either  
side. This is to ensure that neither team is looking into a low west-  
erly sun in the afternoon/evening. Spectators will therefore naturally  
gravitate to the west side of the pitch, as they too will not be looking  
into the sun. The prevailing wind direction can also be a factor in ori-  
entation. There are of course always exceptions to the rule including,  
famously, Wembley Stadium, which is orientated east–west.  
# 3.12 Pitch technology  
The most sophisticated natural turf pitches built for professional  
play will often employ a range of technology in order to maxim-  
ise the quality and usability of the pitch; they can include built  
in irrigation systems with pop-up sprinklers or pitch-side canons,  
and heating and systems embedded in the sub-base which can be  
electrical, water or air based. The system beneath the pitch at the  
Cardiff Millennium Stadium employs a series of large ducts which  
can be used to heat, drain and ventilate the root zone. Where the  
field of play needs to be changed to suit different sports or activ-  
ities, a pitch can be laid in pallets that can be slotted together by  
forklift truck and then removed when required. This allows a turn-  
around time of approximately two days. Some stadia around the  
world have also used retractable pitches where the entire pitch can  
be slid out of a letterbox opening at one end of the stadium. This  
can be a swift process and allows the grass to be grown and main-  
tained in an open air environment and then deployed inside the  
stadium where the environment is not as conducive to long term  
grass growth.  
# 3.13 Floodlighting  
If the sport is to be played outside at night then clearly floodlights will  
be required so that the participants can play and train in safety, Figure  
37.49\. If the facility is designed to accommodate spectators then care  
needs to be taken to ensure that glare from the floodlights is avoided.  
At major events where television cameras will be present, the light lev-  
els on the field of play need to be suitable for broadcast requirements.  
While fixed floodlights are most common, either as part of the roof  
design or at the top of dedicated towers, a number of facilities includ-  
ing Lord’s Cricket Ground in London have erected retractable lighting  
towers so that their visual impact on the city skyline is reduced on  
non-event days, Figure 37.50. The height of the lights will depend on  
the illumination levels required on the field of play and the angle of the  
projected light. Many floodlighting installations now use LED lights,  
as these consume much less energy than traditional halogen lights.  
# 3.14 Head/clearance height  
When planning the design of indoor facilities, the designer must  
take into account the height of the performance space required for  
each sport. Some vary according to the standard of competition  
so governing bodies should be consulted, however Figures 37.51–  
37.53 show recommended minimum heights for club, county,  
regional and national level competition.

# 4 VIEWING STRUCTURES  
# 4.1 Introduction  
This section relates to the requirements for spectator viewing struc-  
tures should these be required to observe the action on the field  
of play. Clearly a school playing field may have some spectators  
attending a match and they may simply stand at the touchline, but  
once the numbers of spectators reaches two or three rows of peo-  
ple, then viewing of the action becomes more difficult and so tier  
structures will be required, Figure 37.54. For example, a road stage  
of a large cycle race such as the Tour de France will often attract  
thousands of spectators along the route but because the route is so  
long, viewing structures are only required at the finish.  
The design of viewing structures can have a significant effect  
on the atmosphere enjoyed by the spectators and indeed the partic-  
ipants. This is where the art and science of design are indivisible.  
For any given seating capacity, the spectators can be accommo-  
dated in a number of ways, related to the overall footprint and  
height, resulting in quite different experiences for all.  
# 4.2 Viewing standards and sightlines  
The first step when designing sightlines is to determine what is required  
to be seen. This could be the touchlines of a pitch, the likely height of  
a rugby ball kicked high into the air, video screen and scoreboards, the  
pitch-side dug out so a manager’s reaction can be seen, or the referee  
sat high on their chair at a tennis match. It should also be remembered  
that it may be impossible to see the entire course for some sports such  
as motor-racing or horse racing depending on the terrain of the course.  
Once the sightline target line or point is established, then the  
rows of spectators can be laid out. Consideration should be given  
to whether the spectators will be standing or seated, or sometimes  
in combination, to view the event. The specific rake of the terrac-  
ing is established by determining the distance of the first row of  
spectators from the target line and the c-value. The c-value is a  
dimension measured in millimetres between the sightlines of spec-  
tators in adjoining rows, perpendicular to the target, as shown in  
Figures 37.55 and 37.56. This is typically between c. 60 and c.  
120 with the higher numbers offering superior views. The mathe-  
matics calculation results in a parabolic curve for the profile of the  
tier, but an important consideration is that the maximum allowable  
rake of a tier is 34 degrees. The technical dimensions of sightlines,  
however, are only one part of perception of quality of view, and  
other factors are relevant. Some spectators prefer to be close to  
the action and will sacrifice the birds-eye view effect that a higher  
viewpoint would offer, and the reverse is also true. At sports such  
as horse racing and motor-racing, the view may need to be more  
panoramic where diagonal views are arguably just as important as  
views directly to the track in front. The speed of movement of the  
action is also a relevant factor. **37-26 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
**37.54** *Spectators accommodated in different configurations*  
**37.55** *Definition of c-values*  
**37.56** *Effect of different c-values*  
**37.57** *Maximum viewing distances for three sports* **4.3 Viewing distance**  
The size of the viewing area is determined by a number of factors,  
including client aspiration, the business plan, site constraints and  
essential activities on the field of play perimeter, but also by the rele-  
vant recommended maximum viewing distance for each sport. For a  
ball sport, the smaller the ball and the faster it moves, the harder it is  
to see and therefore the closer the spectator needs to be. Conversely,  
a larger ball moving more slowly can be seen from a greater distance.  
This means that the maximum viewing distance for tennis would be  
considerably smaller than that for football, Figure 37.57.  
There are of course exceptions to this rule, such as golf or  
cricket where spectators are not really expected to be able to follow  
the ball in flight, but simply observe the reactions of the relevant  
sportsmen and women.  
# 4.4 Seating and standing provision.  
Some spectators will prefer to stand and others to sit, Figure  
37.58\. This may depend on the tradition of the sport, the level of  
# Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-27  
excitement, the duration of the event and governing body regu-  
lations. Football grounds in the UK are currently required to be  
all-seated \(although Government is considering whether ‘safe  
standing’ might be allowed back into UK football stadia in the  
future\), whereas there is more flexibility for other sports. The sight-  
lines will clearly be different for each so care should be taken to  
ensure that views are not impeded should standing spectator posi-  
tions be located in front of seated spectators.  
# 4.5 Seats  
Seating can take many forms depending on the type of event and  
nature of the tier to which they are fixed, Figure 37.59. Simple  
bleacher benches without backs are common in the USA typically  
for high school or university facilities but less so in the UK. Plastic  
tractor seats, without backs, which are fixed down to the terraces  
are common in continental Europe but again less so in the UK.  
While fixed seats with backs are occasionally also used, the most  
common form is for a tip-up seat, which permits the greatest area  
**37.58** *C-value calculations*  
**37.59** *Different seat types* **37-28 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
for circulation when the spectators are on the move. Advances in  
the design of the seats, using polypropylene injection moulding,  
have significantly improved the comfort of spectators with padding  
increasingly used and upholstered seats in VIP areas. The addition  
of UV-stable additives into the plastic can reduce the faded appear-  
ance common at older exterior stands. The typical spacing of seats  
is 500 mm with a maximum number of 28 seats between gangways  
or aisles, Figures 37.60 and 37.61.  
between adjacent rows of tiered seating is 800 mm, with increased  
row depths recommended when larger upholstered seats are used.  
The aisle, row and seat numbers all need to be clearly identified.  
# 4.7 Equality legislation  
The viewing areas of a venue need to take into account the needs  
of disabled people in order to be inclusive. This equally applied to  
wheelchair users, ambulant disabled people and people with other  
**37.60** *Maximum number of seats in a row*  
**37.61** *Typical seat spacing*  
# 4.6 Access to and egress from seating  
When large numbers of people are gathered together, the dynamics of  
crowd movement needs to be carefully considered in order to ensure  
the safety of everybody involved. The Guide to Safety at Sports  
Grounds \(the Green Guide\) exists to assist designers and inspectors of  
sports facilities and should be used as a primary reference document.  
At the earliest stage of planning a sports facility, the crowd  
movements of spectators, be that from local transport links, car  
parks or a combination of the two, need to be understood in order  
to ensure that the areas outside the facility are correctly sized to  
accommodate them. This logic flows through to the number of  
turnstiles or other ticket checking measures required, as the UK  
venue licensing laws require that an accurate record of spectators  
attending events is maintained.  
The space inside that ticket check zone is often termed the con-  
course and there are minimum sizes recommended for this area  
depending on the event. From here, access is gained into the viewing  
structures, terraces or auditorium by means of aisles or gangways –  
apertures formed in the seating tier. The minimum width for these  
access ways is 1200 mm but the actual size should be calculated in  
relation to the number of people using the route, the rate at which  
they flow along it and the length of time they need to do it in. The  
Green Guide advises rate of passage such that 82 spectators can rea-  
sonably exit per minute for every metre width on a level surface \(66  
per minute on stairs and ramps\). Clearly the larger the venue, the  
more complex the calculation will be. The guide also recommends  
that no seat should be further than 30 m from a point of exit, Figure  
37.62\. Once inside the seated viewing area, the typical distance  
disabilities. Particular care should be taken in the design of view-  
ing structures to ensure that the view from a wheelchair position  
is not obscured by a spectator standing in the row in front, Figures  
37.63, 37.64\. Wheelchair positions, with adjacent companion posi-  
tions, would be expected to be distributed in a number of locations  
throughout the viewing areas to offer the similar level of choice  
as for other spectators. The minimum recommended number of  
wheelchair viewing positions and other accessible seating types  
is defined in the Football Licensing Authority \(FLA\) document,  
‘Accessible Stadia’. In respect to duties under the Equality Act  
2010, management policies should take into account the safety,  
security and service needs of all spectators including those with  
‘protected characteristics’ as defined by the Equality Act. See  
Chapter 4, Inclusive and Accessible Design, for more detailed  
information on the Equality Act 2010.  
# 4.8 Stand design  
The construction of the viewing tiers can take many forms, depend-  
ing on the nature of the event or events, Figure 37.65. For one-off  
or annual temporary events, or where supplementary seating is  
required for large events such as Royal Ascot or the British Grand  
Prix at Silverstone, it is common for these tiers to be provided in a  
temporary form based on a scaffold system. For permanent tiers,  
the construction favoured is usually in-situ concrete or bespoke  
pre-cast concrete planks spanning between raker beams. The use  
of timber for these structures is now rare due to fire risk concerns.  
Steel sandwich plates with an inert core to deaden the sound are also  
beginning to be used as an alternative to concrete. In some major **Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-29**  
stadia around the world, the tiers have been designed to move, so  
that they can be reconfigured for events with different requirements.  
For example, the stadium built for the Olympic Games in Sydney  
included a retractable lower tier so that it can be transformed  
between Australian Rules Football and Rugby pitch configurations.  
All types of tier need to be designed to accommodate the fixing  
and the considerable loads applied to safety barriers, and care needs  
to be taken in the design of these barriers to limit as much as possi-  
ble any obstructions to viewing, Figure 37.66.  
**37.62** *The 30 m rule* **37.63** *and 37.64 Wheelchair viewing relative to other viewing*

**37.66** *Barrier design* **37-30 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
# 4.9 Roofs  
The degree to which shade and/or shelter will be required over the  
spectators will depend on a number of factors including national  
climate, local conditions including prevailing wind strength and  
direction, client aspirations and any relevant governing body regu-  
lations, including viewing to high balls and other projectiles, Figure  
37.67\. For example, at the highest club level of both football and  
rugby, a roof over all spectators is recommended. Roofs can be  
erected as temporary structures, although their support columns will  
often obstruct views, which is obviously not desirable. In UK sta-  
dia, it is common for a permanent canopy to be provided over the  
spectators, but not over the field of play. Larger international stadia,  
such as the Millennium \(now Principality\) Stadium in Cardiff, are  
being increasingly designed with retractable roofs to afford them the  
flexibility to accommodate a number of different kinds of events.  
Modern international arenas such as the O2 Arena in London have  
fixed roofs that cover both the spectators and the field of play.  
The roofs of larger sports facilities often involve large span  
structures, for which reinforced concrete, timber glulam and steel  
cable or trussed designs have all been employed. Roof coverings  
tend to be steel or aluminium-profiled sheet, polycarbonate or ten-  
sile fabrics like PTFE/glass or PVC/polyester. The larger the span,  
the more the efficiency of lightweight designs is required. At the  
scale of the stadium or arena, the roof is often the defining element  
of the architectural design.  
# 4.10 Video screens and scoreboards  
Central to the modern spectator experience is information. Scores,  
statistics and replays bombard the viewer on television and the  
spectator at a live event is increasingly demanding a similar experi-  
ence, Figure 37.68. Advances in LED and other technologies have  
allowed significant improvements over older dot-matrix scoreboards  
and typical cricket scoring devices. The size of the information dis-  
played needs to relate to the distance from which it is viewed to  
ensure that it is readable. For examples, at athletics, the height of  
the characters of the display should be between 3 and 5 per cent of  
the distance to the furthest spectator. The number, size and position  
of screens should not impede the view of the action on the field of  
**37.67** *High-ball viewing for football, rugby and javelin*  
**37.68a** *Video screen between stands at a stadium* **Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-31**  
play. These video screens are often linked to the loudspeaker system **5.1 Gymnasium equipment**  
in the stadium to provide a full audio-visual experience. This may include the following\:

# 6 SUPPORT FACILITIES FOR COMPETITORS AND  
# OFFICIALS  
# 6.1 Introduction  
The size and range of accommodation for participants and officials  
will vary depending on the level of competition. These facilities  
will typically include changing rooms, toilets and showers, gym-  
nasia, strength and conditioning areas, warm-up areas, sometimes  
supplemented by medical and drug testing facilities for professional  
sports and areas for information and results. The accessibility of  
these facilities must also be considered. The degree to which these  
facilities can be and are shared by the general public varies from  
sport to sport as well as by the level of competition.

Most sports’ buildings will require changing facilities for com-  
petitors, appropriate to the nature of events being held at the  
venue. The amount and type of accommodation varies depending  
on the type and scale of the event. For school, university and club  
level sport or for where competitors are not divided into teams, a  
changing room with toilet and shower facilities for each gender  
may be all that is required. For team sports, separate changing  
# Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-33  
rooms are usually required for each team, as the rooms will be  
used for team briefing. If there is a ‘home team’, then most of the  
accommodation is concentrated on their requirements; however,  
consideration should be given for multi-purpose use. In larger  
stadia, the use of four changing rooms can provide flexibility  
in catering for a range of team sizes and additional participants  
such as ball boys and girls, mascots, marching bands and other  
entertainers.

**37.94** *Gymnastics equipment\: vaulting horse, balance bar,*  
*parallel bars, rings*  
Corridors used by competitors should be generously sized, prefer-  
ably to a minimum of 1800 mm clear width. Consideration should  
be given to the requirements of wheelchair competitors for the  
intended sports, as competition chairs can have very a wide or long  
wheelbase. This will inform the requirements for corridor widths  
and turning spaces and doors, where competitors are likely to be  
using their competition chairs within the building.  
Changing rooms should be laid out to suit the requirements  
of the intended sport, and should allow for a minimum of 1.6 m2  
per person. Generally, team-based pitch sports require open lay-  
outs with a peripheral array of changing stations and lockers for  
competitors, which allows the team coach or manager to see and  
address all the occupants. Each changing room should contain  
locker facilities, bench seating and garment hanging space for each  
individual competitor, including substitutes. For elite sports facili-  
ties each changing position should be at least 750 mm wide, on the  
assumption that all changing positions will be occupied by the team  
during key periods. For community sports facilities, each changing  
space of bench seat should be provided at a minimum width of  
500 mm.  
# Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-35  
Elite sports changing rooms, Figure 37.95, will also require  
space for TV monitors and tactics boards, small refrigerators for  
refreshments storage, telephone and adjacent space for massage and  
physiotherapy beds. Integrated coaches’ office and changing rooms  
may also be required. Multiple event and individual event venues  
such as athletics may have changing rooms divided into zones by  
free-standing banks of lockers and bench seating. Public access  
sports buildings should also contain family changing cubicle facil-  
ities within the changing rooms. For larger family groups, cubicles  
measuring 2 m × 2 m are also suitable as accessible changing groups.  
All changing rooms should include accessible changing facilities.  
Sanitary facilities, including WCs, urinals, hand basins, hand  
drying fixtures and showers should be designed to meet local build-  
ing regulations. For elite competition venues, main changing rooms  
should be provided with dedicated sanitary facilities, accessed from  
within the changing facility. The toilet fixture numbers should be  
based on the likely peak occupancy of each changing room and  
the sport code recommendations. Publically accessible venues  
should have toilet facilities located adjacent to the changing room  
entrances, but accessed from common circulation areas. The toilet  
fixture numbers should be based on the likely total building occu-  
pancy. As a minimum, at least one unisex accessible toilet facility  
should be provided for participants’ use adjacent to other toilet pro-  
visions. In larger facilities, accessible sanitary facilities should be  
included in gender specific toilet facilities, in addition to the unisex  
facilities.  
Elite competition venue main changing rooms should be  
provided with shower facilities in accordance with sport code rec-  
ommendations, and generally at not less than one shower per 2.3  
changing positions. Publically accessible venue changing rooms  
should have shower facilities provided at not less than one shower  
per 10 changing positions and preferably one shower per six chang-  
ing positions, and include some showers with cubicle enclosures.  
Dependent on layout drying areas between showers and main  
changing areas may be required.  
# 6.3 Officials  
Each sports event requires officials, judges, umpires, linesmen or  
referees, who normally require separate changing and toilet accom-  
modation. Their changing facilities should be close to but ideally  
separate from the competitors’ facilities and in good proximity to  
the field of play, but must be inaccessible to the public or the media.  
The accommodation should be sized for the appropriate number of  
officials, allowing 2.5 m2 per person including associated lockers,  
toilets and showers in accordance with the sports code recommen-  
dations.  
The nature of sport requires different event-specific facilities  
for officials\: these might vary from a race committee room or boat  
for a sailing race, a timing and scoring room at an athletics track  
or a velodrome, or space for a third umpire and scorers at a cricket  
ground. In most instances, a view of the field of play is essential and  
increasingly technological links will also be required. Internally, a  
seat and desk with clear sight of the playing area is a recommended  
minimum. Other facilities may also be required for operating the  
event. These could include an appeals room for up to ten people,  
a competition management room and also a place for processing  
results, and other sport-specific areas such as a weighing room at a  
racecourse, Figure 37.96.  
# 6.4 Team management  
If a sports building houses a home team, then it is likely that a suite  
of team management spaces will be required, preferably in close  
proximity to the main changing rooms. These facilities should not  
be confused with venue management facilities described in Section  
9\. The spaces could include a designated reception area with gen-  
eral support office and secretariat, team manager and assistant  
managers’ offices, and meeting rooms \(which could be shared with  
other administrative activities\). **37-36 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
Other subsidiary activities of team management and participant  
management that also require space may include uniform and kit  
storage, laundry and drying rooms, boot and shoe stores, equip-  
ment storage and equipment repair and maintenance facilities such  
as tennis racquet stringing services.  
# 6.5 Warm-up  
Many sports require a space for the competitors to warm up, prior to  
engaging in their sport. This could be a simple space to stretch, usu-  
ally part of the changing room, dedicated areas adjacent to changing  
For example, athletics meets will have a final call room where  
athletes are checked for event schedule, compliant kit and cor-  
rectly displayed identity numbers before being escorted with  
their event group onto the field of play. For pitch sports, com-  
peting teams will be assembled in a designated players’ tunnel  
to run out in formation onto the field of play as part of the event  
spectacle. Competitor tunnels and field of play entrances may  
also be used for the movement of event entertainers, essential  
field of play equipment and officials as required during the  
event.  
**37.95** *Plan of Premier League football stadium players’ facilities*  
rooms, an indoor 60 m warm-up track for athletics, or even a com-  
pletely separate warm-up track and field for major athletics events.  
If a separate warm-up area is provided, then a dedicated connection  
will be required to link the warm-up area to the field of play.  
# 6.6 Marshalling area/players’ tunnel  
Many sports require the competitors to be gathered into their  
teams, heats or event groups prior to entering the field of play.  
# 6.7 Medical facilities  
Medical support facilities should be designed in accordance with local  
safety and licensing requirements, and sports codes recommendations.  
In major competition venues, the medical room is generally located in  
close proximity to the main changing rooms, with designated step-free  
access routes suitable for stretcher transport from the field of play and  
to a nearby ambulance parking bay. Ideally, the routes from the field  
of play and to the ambulance point should be away from media areas. **37.96** *Plan of racecourse weighing room complex*  
This medical room is likely to be staffed by a doctor and  
other medical staff during the event, and should have more than  
one stretcher bed or treatment table position separated by mobile  
screens, and space for competitors to sit awaiting treatment. In large  
venues, a suite of rooms may be provided, including reception and  
waiting area, a small staff office, stretcher treatment and ambulant  
minor injury treatment areas and shower facilities. Medical rooms  
should be provided with at least one accessible WC cubicle, and  
separate hand washing facilities, secure medical supplies storage  
cabinets and space for treatment and diagnostic equipment. For  
very large events, more than one medical room may be required.  
For publically accessible sports buildings, such as sports halls,  
a first aid room will be required. This room will be sized to suit  
the venue activities and management strategy, and may range from  
a dual purpose office or staff room to a dedicated facility. As a  
minimum, a shared room should contain hand washing facilities,  
a drinking water supply, a secure first aid cabinet, a clear space of  
2.0 m × 1.6 m and door width suitable for stretcher access, and an  
adjacent accessible WC compartment.  
A dedicated first aid room should be large enough for a treat-  
ment trolley bed in addition to the aforementioned facilities. Large  
sports facilities may have dedicated doctor’s rooms or consulta-  
tion rooms as part of more extensive sports medicine or therapy  
facilities. These may also include dedicated X-ray or ultrasound  
diagnostic rooms, specialist physiotherapy and other treatment  
spaces.  
# 6.8 Doping control facilities  
Major competition venues will require a facility which can be used  
for doping control activities, where competitors are tested. This  
does not have to be a dedicated facility, if appropriately equipped  
spaces can be provided for the duration of the event, although they  
must be in a discrete location in close proximity to the competitors’  
changing rooms.  
The size of the facility will depend on the event and numbers of  
competitors to be tested. However, the suite of facilities will gener-  
ally include a reception/waiting area with seating for competitors  
and chaperones, with a drinking water supply, a working or test-  
ing room with a desk and chairs and a secure samples refrigerator,  
with dedicated access to a WC cubicle with hand washing facilities.  
Some sports codes also recommend shower facilities. Doping con-  
trol testing may also occur at smaller venues and outside of events.  
# Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-37  
A dedicated large first aid room may also be used for this occasional  
purpose, provided it meets the minimum criteria set out earlier.  
# 6.9 Lounge/recreational space  
A lounge or recreational space is desirable for participants to use  
after their activity and in smaller facilities can take the form of a club  
room. This consists of an open lounge often equipped with a bar and  
sometimes adjacent catering facilities. In most professional sports,  
this space will be segregated from the public, but in other sports  
facilities this will be a communal space to gather after an event.  
Some sports, such as cricket, take place over a long period of  
time and therefore require catering facilities. This would include  
a kitchen, server, catering storage and space for the participants  
to eat. For amateur sports, this space would double-up as the rec-  
reational space. In facilities open to the public, such as an indoor  
training centre, a café or cafeteria is usually available, where par-  
ticipants and visitors alike would share the area.  
# 6.10 Access and inclusion  
Designers should refer to Football Licensing Authority’s  
‘Accessible Stadia’, BS 8300–2\:2018 and Approved Document M  
of the UK Building Regulations, in order to address the require-  
ments of the Equality Act 2010 in relation to the built environment.  
These documents cover the requirements for accessible and inclu-  
sive design including but not limited to the design of parking,  
corridors, vertical circulation, doors, toilets and washing facilities,  
ensuring the needs of all participants and officials are met.  
# 6.11 Parking/drop off/storage  
Consideration should be given to how participants may arrive at  
the venue. Some will arrive on foot carrying kit bags, some in cars  
requiring car parking, and some may arrive on a team bus. Parking  
will be required close to the changing facilities, including a drop-  
off point for team buses. Sports that require personal equipment  
such as sailing, rowing, kayaking, triathlon will need space for  
parking trailers and for storing the equipment. Water sports will  
also need launching facilities at the water’s edge.  
# 6.12 Gymnasium/fitness centre  
Used for training rather than competition, a gymnasium or fit-  
ness centre will provide a range of equipment and spaces and can  
include the following\: **37-38 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
• Open-plan studio with fitness training equipment and free  
weights  
classes  
• Swimming pool  
• Hydrotherapy  
• Sauna  
• Steam room.  
• Separate studios for dance, aerobics and other specific work-out  
# 7 SUPPORT FACILITIES FOR SPECTATORS  
# 7.1 Introduction  
The size and range of facilities for spectators will vary depend-  
ing on the level of competition. As a minimum, toilets will be a  
requirement of the venue licence, with catering facilities such as  
cafes, bars and restaurants often provided. Ticketed events obvi-  
ously require accommodation for ticketing and larger venues often  
contain private boxes/suites and lounges for hospitality, retail and  
merchandising, medical facilities and information.  
# 7.2 External circulation/approach to venue  
The approach to a venue needs to provide clear and safe access for  
all spectators. This will require the use of wayfinding signage, PA/  
VA systems and external lighting. Where large crowd numbers are  
expected to attend an event, crowd management barriers may also  
be required to control the flow of people.  
# 7.3 Ticketing and security  
All spectators attending a ticketed event will need to pass through  
a ticket control point, Figure 37.97. This can be a simple man-  
ual ticket check, digital ticket scan or via a turnstile, depending  
on whether the venue licence requires an accurate count of the  
number of people attending as is usually the case at a large UK  
event. Turnstiles can be half-height, offering little in the way of  
a secure perimeter but a more user-friendly experience, or full-  
height acting as a perimeter fence also. They should be provided  
on the basis of one per 500 to 750 spectators. If spectators do not  
have a ticket when they arrive at the venue then they will need  
to pick one up from the ticket office. This usually consists of a  
counter with an in-built tray that enables the exchange of money  
for tickets. The counter should have one lowered section at  
760 mm for wheelchair users. For larger events, spectators will  
often be required to pass through either random or mandatory  
security searches with magnetic detectors for both spectators and  
their bags.  
# 7.4 Sanitary provision  
The quantity and gender ratio of toilet provision will vary in  
accordance with the type of sports venue and event and should  
be addressed with the local licensing authorities. General guid-  
ance advises that the gender split of toilet fixtures should be  
based on 50 per cent female\: 50 per cent male provision, see  
Table I. However, it is accepted that for many sports facilities,  
the gender ratio should be based on the normal \(or expected\)  
number of male/female spectators. This may alter the ratio sig-  
nificantly, for example to 30 per cent female\:70 per cent male  
for some pitch sports.  
Also, for multi-purpose venues, where significant swings in  
the audience gender balance can be expected, a level of flexi-  
ble provision or over-provision should be considered where the  
number of spectators is increased above 100 per cent for the  
purpose of the calculation, up to 120 per cent. For competition  
venues, reference should be made to BS 6465\:2009 for initial  
guidance, particularly Section 6.8 and Table 7 – ‘Minimum pro-  
vision of sanitary appliances for assembly buildings where most  
toilet use is during intervals’ for pitch sport and similar short  
duration events.  
# 7.5 Food, drink and other spectator services  
The range of food and drink on offer to spectators will depend on  
the length and type of the event and the aspirations and business  
plan of the venue owner or operator. At the very least, all spectators  
should be provided with a water supply. Visitors to a club level  
competition might expect vending machines or a café or server pro-  
viding basic food. At larger facilities, spectators will often expect  
to be able to access a range of food and beverage outlets during  
their time at an event, provided either on a temporary or permanent  
basis. Temporarily provided concessions typically take the form of  
road trailers with fold-down counters serving a range of fast food,  
and both alcoholic and soft drinks, and so need sufficient space  
for delivery, set up and collection. Permanent concessions can be  
provided either in a single booth or in a range of dedicated booths.  
A typical concession will consist of a preparation area with serving  
position and counter. A standard module for two serving points  
is 2.6 m and each length of counter should have one lowered sec-  
tion at 760 mm for wheelchair users. Queuing lines or rails may be  
required in larger facilities to control the approaches to concessions  
and prevent crowd circulation problems.

It is also typical at larger events to include areas where information  
can be provided to spectators, both to assist wayfinding around the  
venue, but also a results service related to the competition sched-  
ule. Some buildings, especially racecourses, will require a range of  
betting facilities, in the form of Tote booths or betting shops. First  
aid facilities will need to be distributed throughout spectator areas,  
with access to a central area for more serious injuries.  
# 7.6 Hospitality  
Larger sports buildings will incorporate a range of hospitality  
lounges and restaurants within their premises as required by their  
business plan. These do not have to be but can be of higher value  
if arranged to afford a view of the field of play. The following cat-  
egories are typical\:  
• Club lounge – where spectators have access to food and drink in  
an open lounge and a seat within the seating bowl.  
• Box/suite – spectators have access to food and drink in a private  
room and dedicated seats immediately in front of the box/suite.  
• Premium club – where spectators have access to food and drink  
in a small, exclusive lounge and dedicated seats in front of the  
club.  
• Owners/directors/royal box – where VVIPs have access to food  
and drink in a small, exclusive lounge and dedicated seats in  
front of the box.  
# 7.7 TV screens  
In addition to information points, TV screens and monitors are  
often helpful in relaying information or footage of an event to spec-  
tators. These need to be mounted at a suitable height to maintain  
visibility within crowded areas. **37.97** *Plan of Premier League football stadium spectator entry*  
# 7.8 Retail  
Retail spaces enable spectators and other visitors to purchase  
sports-related equipment or merchandise related to a sports team or  
activity, Figure 37.98. These can range in size from a display at the  
reception desk of a community sports facility, to a dedicated mega-  
store at larger sports buildings. The layout of the retail spaces will  
depend on the range of merchandise on offer, but can include rails  
and wall displays. Shirt printing is a popular offer in some sports  
buildings and may require queuing rails. Payment is usually pro-  
cessed at tills or counters set out at the exit point of the retail space.  
# 7.9 Museum/visitor attraction/tours  
Some sports grounds can attain national or regional tourist sig-  
nificance and will incorporate a museum or visitor attraction that  
can be open during non-event days. These are often linked to tours  
of the sports building, which inevitably finish their journey in the  
retail space.  
**37.98** *Plan of Lord’s Cricket Ground shop*  
# 7.10 Access and inclusion  
Designers should refer to Football Licensing Authority’s  
‘Accessible Stadia’, BS 8300 and Approved Document M of the  
UK Building Regulations, in order to address the Equality Act  
2010 in relation to the built environment. These documents cover  
the requirements for accessible and inclusive design including but  
not limited to the design of parking, corridors, vertical circulation,  
# Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-39  
doors, toilets and washing facilities, ensuring the needs of all spec-  
tators are met. Some sports facilities are going beyond the statutory  
requirements by providing facilities like Sensory Rooms.  
# 8 FACILITIES FOR THE MEDIA  
# 8.1 Introduction  
For events at which the media is in attendance, the needs of broad-  
cast \(radio and TV\), written press and photographers need to be  
taken into account in the planning of the venue. The size and range  
of facilities will vary depending on the level of competition, and  
may need to include press workrooms, a press conference suite and  
outside broadcast.  
# 8.2 Dedicated routes  
The media are often provided with a separate entrance point to  
sports buildings. This entrance will usually have a reception desk,  
which is used to undertake accreditation, prior to the media enter-  
ing the building.  
# 8.3 Specific media requirements  
There is a wide range of media and each type has their own require-  
ments, as follows\:  
• Written press\: this group requires access to the seating structures,  
and ideally a desk there at which to work, Figure 37.99. Larger  
facilities typically have a press workroom in addition where  
copy can be completed and uploaded to editors, Figure 37.100.  
• Photographers\: this group requires access to the perimeter of the  
field of play of a pitch sport, with moats sometimes provided  
around the edge of a field of play to enable photographers to  
work during an event, without restricting the view of specta-  
tors. At some course sports such as road cycling, photographers  
would travel in media cars in order to photograph en route.  
• Broadcast media \(radio and television\)\: this group is the most dif-  
ficult to accommodate since the technology advances so rapidly  
and different broadcasters have different requirements. Radio  
broadcasters will typically want to relay commentary from the  
event either from within the seating area or from a room with a  
view of the field of play, and sometimes an opening window so  
the sound of the crowd can be heard in the background. They  
may also want to conduct pitch-side or ‘flash’ interviews prior to  
and after the event. Television broadcasters require a number of  
television camera positions within the viewing structures, which  
need to be carefully designed in order to limit obstructions to **37-40 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
spectator sightlines. These are typically 4 m2. Television studios  
from where the event can be presented can be incorporated either  
as a permanent facility or as part of the temporary event overlay,  
but an elevated view of the field of play is usually required.  
# 8.4 Press workroom  
This room is essentially an office with an extensive array of tables  
and chairs to provide individual working spaces for the media and  
will generally require full IT network capacity for instantaneous  
data transfer. A central location for the distribution of notices,  
results and general information to the media will also be required,  
together with a lounge serving food and drink.  
# 8.5 Press conference room – including translation booth  
In some larger sports buildings a press conference room will be  
required to facilitate interaction between participants in an event  
and the media. This would typically be a dais for the participants  
and seating, sometimes raked, for the media, Figure 37.101. For  
international events, translation facilities may also be required and  
this can be provided with enclosed translation booths at the rear of  
the conference room.  
**37.99** *Conversion to press seat*  
**37.100** *Plan and section of Lord’s Cricket Ground media centre*  
# 8.6 Mixed zone  
For some events, such as a major athletic or football event, a mixed  
zone is provided for participants and the media to interact. This is a  
controlled environment that has access from both the participants’  
changing rooms and the media workroom. A designated space is  
usually allocated for this purpose.  
# 8.7 Outside broadcast  
Broadcasters will also require an outside broadcast area, which will  
need to be sufficiently large to accommodate the trucks and vehi-  
cles that are required. This area will also need to have the ability  
to connect satellite uplinks, for the instant transmission of sporting  
action being broadcast from the event. This space is often provided  
in a separate compound, but can also be built into larger sports  
buildings.  
# 9 SUPPORT ACCOMMODATION FOR FACILITY  
# MANAGEMENT  
# 9.1 Introduction  
Sports buildings need to be managed as do the competition events  
they contain. Apart from the smallest clubhouse-type buildings,  
most facilities would typically include offices, with larger buildings  
including control rooms overlooking the field of play for the safety  
and security of spectators, for the control of video screens and score-  
boards and for competition management. Other back of house areas  
may be required for equipment stores, catering facilities, storage of  
catering and other consumables, plant and waste management.  
# 9.2 Reception  
A reception desk, located within view of the main entrance of the  
building, is required where visitors are expected. Larger sports **Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor 37-41**  
**37.101** *Plan of Premier League football stadium media areas*  
buildings may have a separate service entrance, usually associated  
with the movement of vehicles in and out of the building, with the  
reception acting as a security point.  
# 9.3 Venue management offices  
In larger sports buildings, and where the operating management is  
located at the venue, there should be offices for the director \(20 m2\),  
secretariat \(12 m2\), other staff members \(12 m2 per person\), public  
relations and marketing \(12 m2 per person\) and event organisation  
\(12 m2 per person\). In smaller sports buildings some of these rooms  
and functions can be combined for efficiency. A boardroom may  
also be required for meetings and the display of trophies and other  
associated memorabilia. This room would typically be between  
30 m2 and 50 m2  
.  
# 9.4 Venue control room  
A venue control room, often linked to an adjacent security control  
room \(in larger facilities\), is required to enable management of the  
sports competition and also the operation of the sports building,  
Figures 37.102 and 37.103. This should have a clear sight of the  
field of play and may require a specific position, depending on the  
requirements of the particular sport. Should CCTV be required  
at the venue, then the screens and recording equipment would be  
located in this room.  
# 9.5 Scoreboards and video screens  
Most sports buildings will require a scoreboard for the display  
of competition results and this should to be located in a position  
where both participants and spectators can view them clearly. In  
smaller buildings, the scoreboard may be operated manually, but in  
larger buildings the scoreboard is likely to be electronic and con-  
trolled from either the venue control room or timing and scoring  
control room depending on whether these functions are separate.  
Spectators increasingly expect to see live action relayed onto large  
screens, or at the very least replays of key action, so large format  
LED screens play an important role in the design of this building  
type. The screen size and location will depend on the size of the  
building and the type of event, but like scoreboards, needs to be  
located in a position where the majority of spectators can view it  
without glare. **37-42 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
**37.102** *Stadium control suite – example 1*  
**37.103** *Stadium control suite – example 2* **9.6 Staff accreditation**  
Staff entering a sports building will need to be registered and  
accredited upon arrival. This usually requires a reception area and  
desk for this purpose. For larger sports events the permanent staff  
can be supplemented by a large number of temporary staff and the  
accreditation area will need to be sized accordingly.  
# 9.7 Staff change  
The staff change area should provide a staff cloakroom, where staff  
can change and leave their clothing in lockers, as well as storage for  
uniforms and a small refreshment area.  
# 9.8 Briefing room  
A briefing room should be provided for issuing instructions to  
staff about the operation of an event. The room should be based on  
1.5 m2 per person.  
# 9.9 Catering  
Most sports buildings will require some form of kitchen, although  
off-site kitchens may sometimes be used to provide catering facili-  
ties. The main kitchen will require spaces for storage, preparation,  
delivery and clean-up. Bar stores may also be required for buildings  
serving alcohol. Larger buildings may employ a series of satellite  
kitchens that provide warm-up and distribution facilities closer to  
hospitality spaces located throughout the building.  
# 9.10 Police/security  
Some sports buildings and events will require a police presence,  
as part of the operational strategy for those events. The number  
of police and range of facilities will vary, depending on the type  
of event and licensing requirements. Some individual events may  
require a very small police presence, while others may require hun-  
dreds of police officers, in addition to the security staff employed  
by the building itself. The larger stadia may require detention  
rooms with two cells and associated toilets, mass arrest facili-  
ties for up to 60 spectators, a waiting and information room and  
refreshment rooms.  
# 9.11 IT comms rooms  
A dedicated IT comms room is likely to be required in all but a  
small clubhouse, with a controlled environment to protect the IT  
equipment. Larger facilities may require a number of IT comms  
rooms, which should be located throughout the building.  
# 9.12 Equipment stores  
Each sport will have a different requirement for the size and extent  
of equipment stores, ranging from simple sports equipment to large  
boats. The stores should be sized to accommodate storage racks  
for the equipment and may also need to include set-up space and  
workshops for maintaining and repairing equipment.  
# 9.13 Groundskeeping  
An area will be required by the groundskeeping staff to store and  
maintain the equipment required to manage the field of play. This  
may include vehicles, field equipment, tools, covers and pitch  
lighting, as well as a wash-down facility. Playing fields may also  
require irrigation tanks as part of the pitch maintenance strategy,  
which can take up a significant amount of space.  
# 9.14 Waste management  
The amount of waste generated at a modern venue can be consid-  
erable, despite recent trends for more sustainable packaging used  
in the food and beverage outlets. At a multi-level stadium, waste is  
generally collected on each tier of the seating bowl and then moved  
down to a central collection point in the service level for sorting,  
recycling and disposal. Larger facilities may require compactors to  
handle the level of waste generated in the building.

# 10 EXAMPLES OF SPORTS FACILITIES FOR  
# VARIOUS SPORTS  
As noted in the introduction to this chapter, sports facilities can  
come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from a simple recreation  
space, up to a complex, multi-functional building. The scales of  
facility can be categorised as follows.  
# 10.1 Playing area  
This sports facility simply comprises a playing area on which the  
sporting activity takes place, such as a football field marked out in  
a park; lanes marked on rivers for canoeing; or the use of roads for  
marathons.  
# 10.2 Playing area with clubhouse \(training grounds\)  
This sports facility comprises a playing area and some accommo-  
dation that simply serves the needs of the participants, such as a  
cricket pavilion located adjacent to a cricket pitch; a boathouse  
placed next to a lake for rowing; or some changing rooms set  
alongside a rugby field.  
# 10.3 Sport-specific venues  
This sports facility comprises a specific playing area and a range of  
accommodation that will serve the needs of participants, spectators,  
media and facilities management for a specific sport. The shape  
of the playing area will often give a unique characteristic to the  
design of the sports facility, such as a grandstand running along-  
side the closing straight of a racecourse or motor-racing circuit; the  
V-shaped seating arrangement of a baseball park; or the undulating  
form of the seating bowl responding to the contours of the cycle  
track in a velodrome.  
# 10.4 Multi-purpose venues \(hosting concerts and events\)  
This sports facility comprises a playing area that can often be used  
for multiple events and provides a range of accommodation that  
will serve the needs of participants, spectators, media and facilities  
management for more than one type of sport or event. The shape  
of the playing area will often enable more than one sport to be  
undertaken within the facility, such as football and rugby in rectan-  
gular stadia; cricket and Australian football in oval stadia; multiple  
sports and events in an indoor arena; multi-sports in a sports hall or  
leisure centre; or a wide variety of water sports on an inland lake  
or sheltered harbour.

*Outline brief*  
The brief for the project was developed with the client team in con-  
sultation with their stakeholders. Motherwell College’s interest in  
the project related to their sports science course for which class-  
room and access to training facilities was required.  
The brief was for a multi-sports facility with both indoor and  
outdoor facilities capable of being used for competitive sport and **37-44 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
training at the full range of levels from school to elite. The facility  
is capable of accommodating 5000 spectators.  
*Response to brief*  
The architect’s aim was to create as much mix between the dif-  
ferent sports and different levels of sports as possible, so that all  
the building’s users could learn from each other. A key part of the  
strategy was to establish visible links within the building. A cen-  
tral spine was created that connected the three halls, which contain  
a full-size indoor football pitch, athletics and a multi-sport hall,  
Figures 37.104–37.110. This central spine has two levels\: chang-  
ing and toilet facilities at the lower level, and cafeteria, classrooms  
and offices at the upper level with views into the halls. In order to  
accommodate the potential capacity of 5000 for a large event, the  
hall has fire exits and ventilation to cater for 5000 users, on the  
assumption that additional services including sanitary accommo-  
dation will need to be brought to site for the event.  
*General description of the building and site*  
The building is situated on a former steel mill site. The archi-  
tecture of the building reflects this industrial past with its  
profiled metal cladding and pared-down internal finishes. The  
tilted forms of the building derive from allowing north light  
into the large halls to eliminate glare for competitors. This  
results in a distinctive profile to the building that sits well in  
the landscape.  
The facility incorporates an outdoor full-size all-weather  
artificial football pitch, and six five-a-side pitches. These are all  
artificial grass pitches due to the extended period of use through-  
out the year and the reduced maintenance costs when compared  
to natural turf. There is also an external 1 km running track, well  
lit and surfaced with tarmac, which loops around the complex.  
There are also 450 parking spaces, of which eight are reserved  
for families and 22 for disabled drivers, with options for car pool  
spaces.

**37.109** *Long section through athletics hall*  
**37.110** *Long section through football hall and sports hall* **37-48 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**  
*Sports and events*  
Football, track and field athletics, badminton, volleyball, basket-  
ball, handball and netball are all played at the facility. As well as  
the outdoor pitches, there is a full-size indoor football pitch, which  
is a third generation \(3G\) artificial pitch, achieving a FIFA two star  
rating. It is used by local professional teams for training. There is a  
hall for athletics, with a rubber sports floor, equipped with a 135 m  
running track, long jump pits and throwing cages.  
The multi-sports hall hosts badminton, volleyball, basketball,  
handball and netball competition events on a sprung timber floor  
and has a 9.2 m vertical clearance to accommodate national level  
badminton events, but not international ones.  
*Technology*  
There are scoreboards in each of the halls, with camera tech-  
nology in the athletics hall used for timing and scoring during  
competition. There is a central public address system for the  
building, along with CCTV. The extensive natural lighting of  
the halls is supplemented by motion-controlled artificial lighting.  
The football and athletics halls are naturally ventilated. There is a  
combined heat and power plant supplying heating and hot water,  
supplemented by radiant heating in the athletics hall. The foot-  
ball hall is treated as a ‘garage’ space so is not heated but well  
insulated for acoustic reasons, so is protected from extremes of  
temperature. In the multi-purpose hall, the air handling system  
is controllable to limit drafts so that the flight of the shuttlecock  
is unaffected. Entry into the hall is gained by draft lobbies for  
the same reason. A fire engineering approach was developed  
for the building which required sprinklers to be installed in the  
spine building with automatic smoke vents in the roof combined  
with smoke reservoirs calculated to coordinate with the required  
escape times. The football hall also has automatic smoke vents,  
which have been designed to cater for the possible use as an event  
building for 5000 people.  
*Viewing structures*  
Retractable tiered seating systems are installed in both the foot-  
ball and multi-sport hall, providing 400 seats in the former and 750  
seats in the latter. Wheelchair positions are included with compan-  
ions in both locations. Informal viewing is also possible from the  
first floor viewing gallery.  
*Accommodation*  
Facilities include\:  
• Eight changing rooms with toilet facilities for players and two  
for officials with direct access to each hall and to the external  
pitches  
• Break-out areas where results of training can be analysed and  
athletes can relax  
• Strength and conditioning area, equipped with benches and free  
weights for the training of elite athletes  
• Medical room for sports injuries  
• Drug testing area  
• Gymnasium for the general public  
• Two dance/general exercise studios with sprung timber floors  
• Small shop behind reception  
• Upper level cafeteria, accessed by stairs and lifts  
• Classrooms  
• Building management room and satellite offices for the regional  
sports bodies and the facility managers.  
*Construction*  
The building has a steel frame, internal concrete block walls with  
steel ring beam with 3.5 m height for impact resistance. The floor  
of the spine building is finished with quartz acrylic resin providing  
a robust but attractive finish. Externally, the roof and walls of the  
building are clad with an aluminium standing seam system. The  
finish of the ceilings in the halls is the galvanised liner trays for  
the cladding system, but in the multi-sport hall, the liner is powder  
coated a dark grey so that a shuttlecock is visible. The north lights  
are polycarbonate, but in the multi-sport hall they are translucent to  
further diffuse the light. Primary steelwork is painted yellow inter-  
nally and on the door externally, which provides bright contrast to  
the industrial aesthetic of silver cladding that is reminiscent of the  
industrial heritage, Figures 37.111 and 37.112.

# 11.2 Tottenham Hotspur Stadium  
Client Tottenham Hotspur Football Club  
Architect Populous  
Structural engineer Buro Happold/Schlaich Bergermann Partner  
\(roof\)  
Services engineer Buro Happold  
Main contractor Mace  
Location London, England  
Gross internal area 120,000 m2  
Completed April 2019  
*Outline brief*  
The client brief for Tottenham Hotspur Stadium required the creation  
of a new multi-purpose sports and leisure destination for London.  
The brief was developed in close consultation with the client team  
and their stakeholders to incorporate bespoke facilities for football  
and American NFL football teams, as well as the ability to host other  
major sports events and activities such as concerts and conferences.  
*Design response*  
The design built on both the traditions of English football stadia  
and the quality of customer experience provided in modern stadia  
to create a stadium with an intense match day atmosphere. This  
included the use of a 17500-seat single-tier stand behind the home  
goal at the southern end of the stadium, along with stands angled  
at the maximum allowable gradient on the other three sides of  
the stadium, to make the crowd feel as though it was ‘on top’ of  
the pitch. The front row of seats is no more than 8 m from the  
pitch area, placing fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable  
modern stadium.  
Figures 37.113a–c show ground, podium and roof level plans  
of the stadium.  
The spectator spaces were designed to provide an enhanced  
offer of experiences that encourage fans to arrive earlier before  
matches and stay later. Central to this philosophy is the south stand  
atrium space, incorporating a range of food stalls, Europe’s longest  
bar \(65 m\), and the world’s first brewery in a football stadium.  
The general concourse also includes three feature bars that rival the  
very best high street offering. A range of hospitality lounges and  
restaurants offer various fine dining experiences.  
To address the client’s requirement for a bespoke ‘home’ for the  
NFL in the UK, a world-first retractable pitch design was devel-  
oped. In this, the grass pitch divides into three sections to sidestep  
the columns supporting the south stand when it is retracted, uncov-  
ering an artificial playing surface beneath. The artificial pitch is  
used to stage NFL games and other events such as concerts, ensur-  
ing that the football-playing surface is kept in peak condition.  
*General description*  
The stadium is situated on a tight urban site, with the front entrance  
located directly along a high road into the city of London. The  
design of the stadium is a simple oval form in plan around a  
9,912 sqm field of play, Figure 37.115, with a perforated metal  
façade rising towards the southern end of the stadium with glazing  
to public spaces, Figure 37.116.  
The restricted site required a new podium level to be built to  
the north and south of the stadium to keep all of the back of house  
facilities out of sight, and enable access for general spectators into  
the stadium. Hospitality fans enter the stadium on the east and west  
sides of the stadium at street level. **37-50 Sports facilities\: indoor and outdoor**

A visitors’ centre is located in the south-west corner of the site, incor-  
porating a Grade II listed Georgian property as part of the museum and  
shop area. The club’s new headquarters are incorporated at the northern  
end of the development site, with a bridge link to the stadium’s north stand.  
*Sports and events*  
The stadium is home to Premier League football club Tottenham  
Hotspur and includes a full-size natural grass football pitch for  
these matches. The stadium also contains a full-size artificial  
turf pitch underneath the natural grass pitch to host American  
football. It will host a minimum of two NFL games per year as  
part of a ten-year partnership between Tottenham Hotspur and  
the NFL. Additionally, the stadium is a venue for concerts and  
other entertainment events as well as conferencing and corporate  
hospitality.  
*Technology*  
There are four large LED screens within the seating bowl and nearly  
a kilometre of LED ribbon boards running around the perimeter of  
the pitch and the tier fronts of each stand. These LED displays are  
integrated with the stadium lighting and main loudspeaker sound  
system within the seating bowl to create a complete audio-visual  
experience. There is another large LED screen located on the exter-  
nal façade of the stadium, along with two large LED screens within  
the entrance foyers on the east and west sides of the stadium.  
Further digital displays are located in the premium hospitality  
lounges, the media centre and broadcast facilities.  
A high-density Wi-Fi and communications network has been  
incorporated into the fabric of the building, providing connectivity and  
mobile phone coverage and cashless transactions in all areas of the  
stadium.  
*Viewing structures*  
The 25870 sqm seating bowl has a seating capacity of 62303 seats,  
with three retractable front rows in the south stand. Wheelchair  
positions with companion positions are included in a number of  
different locations.  
*Accommodation*  
This includes\:  
• Two football changing rooms with toilet and medical facilities  
for players  
• Changing facilities for match day officials  
• Additional two locker rooms with toilet and medical facilities for  
American football teams  
• Concourses with toilets and refreshment facilities. Concourse  
areas include Lower \(5 467 sqm\); Upper \(5511 sqm\); South  
Stand \(4483 sqm\)  
• Concession area \(2267 sqm\)  
• Open lounges, restaurants and enclosed boxes for hospitality  
guests  
• Kitchen area \(2444 sqm\) including a central main production  
kitchen  
• Media facilities including press workroom, press conference  
room, working positions in the seating bowl  
• Television studios with a view of the pitch, and an outside broad-  
cast area of 1300 sqm  
• Stadium control room for event management  
• Changing facilities for stewards and catering staff  
• Storage areas for the grounds staff  
• Ticket office \(228 sqm\)  
• Retail store/museum area \(22830 sqm\). *Construction*  
While the northern section is largely a concrete structure, the  
single-tier south stand has a steel frame, which allowed for  
rapid construction. The seating tiers are built out of pre-cast  
concrete, while the roof is a steel cable-net structure, braced  
back to a compression ring running around the perimeter of  
the roof.  
The natural grass pitch is formed within three steel trays,  
which retract on rails to expose the artificial grass surface under-  
neath.  
The façade of the stadium is composed of a mixture of per-  
forated aluminium panels, double and single glazed panels and  
pre-cast concrete wall panels.

*Report* after the chair of the advisory committee responsible, set  
out a number of key principles for addressing the pressure from  
motor traffic. This argued that the two functions of streets, their  
traffic role on the one hand and their civic and social role on the  
other, were fundamentally incompatible and advocated a policy of  
segregation of traffic from the pedestrian role.  
*Traffic in Towns*’ legacy is notable for the introduction of  
concepts such as pedestrian precincts, ring roads and high-level  
pedestrian walkways, and the underpasses, overbridges, signals,  
barriers and bollards associated with physical separation.  
By the end of the 1970s, a reaction to the principles of seg-  
regation was evident across many European countries. In the  
Netherlands, pioneers such as Joost Váhl experimented with  
mixed-use, low-speed residential streets giving rise to the *woonerf*,  
later introduced into the UK as ‘home zones’. Hans Monderman,  
a traffic engineer responsible for road safety in the north of the  
Netherlands, explored ways to combine behavioural psychology  
and engineering to extend informal unsegregated street design into  
busier intersections and town centres. The term ‘shared space’ was  
coined in 2003 to describe the emerging paradigm of fully inte-  
grated, mixed-use streets, in contrast to conventional segregation  
\(see Section 8\).  
The publication of the *Manual for streets \(1 and 2\)* in 2007  
and 2011, covering England and Wales, reflected this critical shift  
in street design policy. The Scottish Executive published similar  
guidance with *Designing streets*, and the Irish Government has fol-  
lowed suit with *Design manual for urban roads and streets* \(2013\).  
Research and guidance by Commission for Architecture and the  
Built Environment, English Heritage and the Chartered Institution  
of Highways & Transportation has helped articulate the implica-  
tions of a policy of integration, rather than segregation, of traffic  
from the social fabric of towns and cities.  
# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Role  
Streets are defined as the public roads and spaces between private  
buildings in cities, towns or villages. Streets make up the great  
majority of the public space of any community. Their design, man-  
agement and maintenance are critical to the economic and social  
quality of the built environment.  
Streets are complicated spaces. They serve a wide range of  
functions from providing access and the foreground to buildings,  
to accommodating drainage and service channels. The principal  
functions fall into two categories\:  
• Space for transport and movement – streets provide the corridors  
for pedestrian and bicycle movement, vehicular traffic, deliver-  
ies and public transport in all its variations.  
• Space for exchange and interaction – streets provide the pub-  
lic space for formal and informal encounters and transactions,  
including trade, information, political activities, festivals and  
events and day-to-day social intercourse.  
# 1.2 Policy  
The need to balance these two main functions of streets lies at the  
core of design policy developments over much of the past century.  
The arrival of automobiles at the outset of the twentieth century,  
and their huge impact on the spatial patterns and form of the built  
environment, has generated significant challenges for architects,  
urban designers and engineers. Designing spaces for people while  
coping with the practical realities of vehicles continues to require  
experimentation and creativity.  
Policy and best practice in this area are in transition. In 1963, the  
publication of *Traffic in Towns*, often referred to as the *Buchanan*  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-41  
# 2 VEHICLES  
# 2.1 Scope  
This section deals with data on\:  
• Cycles  
• Motor-cycles and scooters  
• Automobiles\: cars and small vans up to 2½ tonnes unladen  
weight  
• Commercial vehicles up to 10 tonnes unladen weight  
• Public service vehicles\: buses and coaches  
• Large commercial vehicles maximum 44 tonnes. This class  
includes those with drawbar trailers.  
# 2.2 Dimensions  
The dimensions of some examples of each class are given in  
Figure 38.1\. In any specific case, the manufacturer’s data should  
be consulted.

# 2.3 Unit construction  
In the field of the larger commercial vehicles, unit construction is  
now almost universally employed. In this system, a given chassis  
can be fitted with a variety of body shells for specific purposes and  
loads, mainly of standard dimensions. The body can be changed at  
will, permitting one body to be loaded while the chassis is on the  
road with another body delivering goods elsewhere.  
A particular example is the standard container, which is used  
on lorries, ships, railways or even as a storage unit in the open,  
Figure 38.2\. As this system was first developed in the USA, the  
standard dimensions are imperial, but the German railways devel-  
oped a parallel version.  
# 2.4 Turning circles  
Apart from the physical dimensions, it is necessary to know the  
critical characteristics of the vehicle in motion, particularly when  
manoeuvring while parking or preparing to load. These characteris-  
tics are complicated, and usually the manufacturer will quote solely  
the diameter of the turning circle, either between kerbs or between  
walls. **38.2** *Dimensions of standard containers* **38-6 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
Manoeuvring diagrams have been published for various vehicles  
for the following operations\:  
• Turning through 90°  
• Causing the vehicle to face in the opposite direction by means of  
a 360° turn in forward gear.  
• Ditto in reverse gear  
• Causing the vehicle to face in the opposite direction by means of  
both the forward and reverse gears \(three-point turn\), in T-form  
• Ditto in Y-form  
• Ditto in a forward side turn  
• Ditto in a reverse side turn.  
Figure 38.3 shows the 90° turns for some of the common vehicles.  
The other diagrams will be needed for the design of turnarounds in  
cul-de-sacs, and so forth. The use of the published turning circle  
sizes is not sufficient for the following additional factors\:  
• The distance required for the driver to turn the steering wheel  
from straight ahead to full lock depends on the speed, which for  
the purposes of Figure 38.3 is between 8 and 16 km/h  
• The radius of turn differs between a right-hand and a left-hand turn  
• The path traversed by the rear wheels is different from that by  
the front wheels. In a commercial vehicle travelling at slow  
speed, the rear wheels follow a smaller arc to the front wheels,  
the amount depending largely on the distance between the axles.  
The divergence between the arcs of the wheels on the same side  
of the vehicle is termed the ‘cut in’, and value of this determines  
the total track width of the turning vehicle, always greater than  
when on the straight  
• While few vehicles have a measurable side overhang of the  
body beyond the wheel track, many have considerable overhang  
at front and rear. This is important at the front\: the extra width  
beyond the wheel tracks described by the body is known as ‘cut-  
out’. Allowance should be made for front and rear overhang  
when designing turnarounds etc. by having no vertical obstruc-  
tions within 1.2 m of the carriageway edge  
• Swept path analysis software should be used to review proposals  
in the first instance.  
# 3 ROADS IN GENERAL  
# 3.1 Introduction  
This chapter will generally deal only with roads and facilities  
within development sites, such as industrial parks and housing  
estates. Public roads are not normally the concern of the architect,  
but Table I gives the recommended carriageway widths for most  
road types.  
**38.3** *Geometric characteristics of typical vehicles turning through 90°* The broad hierarchy of roads is\:  
• Motorways and trunk roads  
• Distributors \(primary, district and local\)  
• Access roads.  
*Definitions*  
*Carriageway*\: the area of road surface used by moving vehicles.  
*Carriageway width*\: the distance between the kerbs forming the  
carriageway edges.  
*Dual carriageway*\: a road with a central reserve, each separate  
carriageway carrying traffic in the reverse direction lane\: a width  
of carriageway capable of carrying a single line, or multiple  
lanes, of vehicles, usually delineated with white-painted dashed  
lines on the carriageway surface.  
*Lane width*\: since the maximum vehicle width permitted is 2.5 m,  
and the minimum clearance between parallel vehicles at 30 mph  
is 0.5 m, the minimum lane width is 3 m. However, vehicles  
travelling at speed require greater clearance and large vehicles  
need greater widths on curves, so faster roads have wider lanes  
*Cycle track or cycle path*\: a completely separated right-of-way  
primarily for the use of bicycles, but can still be used by pedes-  
trians  
*Cycle lane*\: a portion of the carriageway which has been desig-  
nated by striping, signing and road markings for preferential or  
exclusive use by cyclists

# Streets and spaces for people and vehicles 38-7  
*Shared-use footway/cycle track*\: a right-of-way designated by  
signs or permanent markings as a bicycle route, but which is also  
shared with pedestrians  
*Footway*\: an area of road devoted solely for the use of pedestri-  
ans, including those in wheelchairs or with prams, and running  
alongside the vehicular carriageway. In Britain, the footway is also  
called the ‘pavement’ by a layperson; in the USA, the ‘sidewalk’.  
*Footpath*\: a facility for pedestrians not forming part of a road.  
# 3.2 Roads in residential areas  
This section focuses mainly on roads in residential areas and in  
housing estates. However, the principles are the same in industrial  
and business areas, only the details will differ.  
*Environmental areas*  
An ‘environmental area’ is surrounded by distributor roads from  
which access to the properties within is gained solely via the access  
roads within it. The access road network is designed with the fol-  
lowing in mind\:  
• Road access to within 25 m \(or 15 m in certain cases\) of each  
house  
• Road access to all private garages, whether within curtilages or  
in garage courts; and to all parking areas  
• Through traffic from one distributor road to another, or to  
another part of the same road \(avoiding a traffic blockage\) is  
either impossible or severely discouraged  
• Necessary tradesmen, e.g. ‘milk-rounds’, calling at all or most  
properties in sequence, are not unreasonably diverted  
• In general, traffic is not allowed to proceed too fast, but visibility  
at all times is at least the stopping distance for the intended speed  
\(not the legal\) limit.  
Figure 38.4 illustrates typical access road layouts.  
**38.4** *a and b are through roads, so tortuous as to discourage*  
*through traffic; c and d are non-through systems, but avoid the*  
*need for hammer-head turnarounds; e is a cul-de-sac system, but*  
*will have substantial traffic at the entrance; f is to be preferred on*  
*this count, although both systems pose problems for permeability*  
*Types of access road*  
Access roads in residential areas are of three types \(although you  
should always check with the relevant local highway authority\)\:  
• *Major access roads \(or transitional\)*\: These are short lengths of  
road connecting a distributor road with the minor access road  
network, the latter at a T-junction. They are normally 6 m wide,  
have no direct access to property along their length and serve  
from 200 to 400 dwellings. **38-8 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**

network, will serve up to 200 dwellings and be 5.5 m wide with  
only one footway. Occasionally a single-track ‘car way’ 2.75 m  
wide is used for access to about 50 dwellings, in conjunction  
with a separate footpath system.  
• *Shared private drives, mews courts, garage courts and housing*  
*squares*\: Generally, these facilities serve up to 20 dwellings, and  
are designed for joint pedestrian/vehicle use with hard surfaces,  
no upstand kerbs and no footways. Access to them from the col-  
lector roads is marked by some device such as a short ramp or  
rough surface material, with the purpose of slowing down the  
traffic.  
*Designed controls*  
Conventionally roads were designed so that cars could be parked  
on both sides, and two cars could still pass. This encouraged use  
by vehicles trying to avoid congestion on main roads, with exces-  
sive speed and consequent nuisance and danger to the inhabitants.  
Figure 38.5 shows the characteristics of the various carriageway  
widths.  
While legal penalties can apply to misuse of these roads, these  
require enforcement resources which are rarely available. It is  
therefore the designer’s responsibility to build in the discourage-  
ment required. Closures, narrowing and speed humps are now used  
in existing roads; but these have unwanted side-effects such as  
complications for ambulances, fire engines and even local buses.  
# Streets and spaces for people and vehicles 38-9  
In new developments, it should be possible to avoid these meas-  
ures and still provide sufficient restraints. Also, road humps should  
always be considered as a last resort to solving a problem with  
speeding and not as first port of call.  
Figures 38.6 to 38.8 show typical arrangements of humps. The  
slowing effect of various ramps is detailed in Table II. Figures 38.9  
and 38.10 give the Department of Transport requirements for hump  
dimensions.  
**38.7** *Double cushion humps*  
**38.6** *Cushion hump* **38.8** *Flat-top hump used as a pedestrian crossing*  
**38.9** *Dimensions of round top road hump from the Highways \(Road Hump\) Regulations 1990* **38-10 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
**38.10** *Dimensions of flat-top hump from the same source. 2.5* *m minimum length to be increased to 6* *m if located on a bus route*  
There are considerable disadvantages to the use of humps.  
Vehicles, such as delivery vans, that are continuously using roads  
with humps find that maintenance costs on tyres, wheels and sus-  
pensions are significantly increased. Buses and ambulances find  
that their passengers experience discomfort and even danger. An  
alternative slowing device to the hump is the ‘chicane’, examples  
of which are shown in Figure 38.11.  
transferring bin and skips from storage areas to collection points,  
to reduce the risks of injury to operatives from handling containers.  
The location of waste storage and access to collection points is  
also important, as operators need to collect refuse or recycling mate-  
rials in the most efficient manner possible. Unnecessarily long dwell  
times or duplicate traversing of routes requires a larger fleet of vehi-  
cles and additional labour force, which has an effect on the overall  
costs of operation. Designers should therefore seek to optimise col-  
lection routes in their scheme layouts to achieve these objectives.  
# 3.3 Roads in industrial parks  
These must provide for use by the largest vehicles, but otherwise  
pose the same problems as roads in housing estates. Layout should  
discourage traffic using the roads as a cut-through, and should also  
ensure that the speed of the legitimate traffic is kept low. This is  
not a simple matter, as corner radii cannot be too sharp when heavy  
vehicles constitute a substantial proportion of the traffic.  
**38.11** *Chicane types of traffic slowing device*  
# 4 ROAD DESIGN DETAILS  
# 4.1 Visibility and stopping sight distance  
It is an axiom of road design that the driver should be able to see  
a distance at least as far as the distance he or she needs to stop in.  
If the object seen is also a moving vehicle, the sight distance must  
allow both vehicles to stop before colliding.  
Table III gives the design stopping sight distances for residen-  
tial areas \(*Manual for streets*\) and primary distributor roads \(*Design*  
# Table III Design stopping distances  
Once garages and visitors’ parking spaces are provided, kerbside  
parking may be discouraged by minimising the width of the road  
carriageway. However, occasional access by large furniture vans  
\(and, unfortunately, fire appliances\) will be necessary; and regu-  
lar visits by refuse collection vehicles have to be as trouble-free as  
possible. For example, local authorities dislike cul-de-sacs with end  
turning areas permanently obstructed by parked cars, and may well  
insist on residents bringing their refuse to the entrance of the road.  
Refuse vehicles and delivery vans blocking narrow roads cause  
annoyance to other residents trying to pass; consider having at least  
two routes of access/egress for most parts of the area.  
It is important to consider the manoeuvring requirements of  
refuse vehicles. Typical 3-axle collection vehicles can be up to  
11.6 m long and can have a turning circle of over 20 m. Safety  
considerations are vital particularly when operating in enclosed  
service yards or residential streets where there may be children  
present. BS5906\: 2005 Waste Management in Buildings states that  
reversing movements should be kept to a minimum and vehicles  
in service areas should enter and leave in a forward direction. If  
reversing is unavoidable then the collection vehicle should not  
reverse more than 12 m.  
Local authorities should always be consulted about their  
requirements as the types and sizes of vehicles they operate vary  
from area to area. They may also stipulate maximum distances for

**38.13** *Required distances for unobstructed visibility*  
# 4.2 Curves  
As mentioned in Section 3.4, when a vehicle travels round a curve  
the road width it occupies is greater than the track width on the  
straight. The width of carriageway should be increased on curves to  
compensate; this can be determined by swept path analysis.  
# 4.3 Corners  
Since the internal radius of turn of a large commercial vehicle is  
about 8 m, it will be seen that a kerb radius of 10 m will be needed  
for such vehicles to maintain a constant distance from the kerb  
while turning the corner, also allowing some spare for the distance  
covered while turning the steering wheel. A kerb radius of 10 m  
in all cases would mean large areas of carriageway at junctions,  
and would be inappropriate in scale in many places, particularly in  
residential areas. Where traffic volumes are low there is no reason  
why the occasional large vehicle should not encroach on the oppo-  
site side of the road, provided that clear visibility is maintained so  
that vehicles affected by the manoeuvre can take avoiding action  
in time. Figure 38.14 illustrates the effects of using radii of 10, 6  
and 4 m.

Figure 38.15 can be employed \(when considering cars only\). Some  
local authorities require more generous minimum standards for  
their refuse collection and fire-fighting vehicles. In cases of doubt,  
use the specimen vehicle track diagrams in Figure 38.3.  
# 4.5 Gradients  
Acceptable gradients are hard to define. What would be quite  
normal in the Peak District would be considered horrendous  
in Lincolnshire. Consider the likelihood of snow and icy con-  
ditions in winter, when anything greater than about 12 per  
cent becomes impassable without snow tyres or chains. Most **38-12 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
general-purpose roads are now constructed to 7 per cent or less.  
Ramps to lorry loading bays and car parking garages are lim-  
ited to 10 per cent. Some car parks in basements or multi-storey  
have gradients up to 15 per cent \(and occasionally beyond\).  
These steep gradients require vertical transition curves at each  
end to avoid damage to vehicles. Also, steep gradients either up  
or down should be avoided close to the back of pavement line  
or road edge, as it is difficult to see clearly or to take preventa-  
tive action if needed.  
# 4.6 Verges  
Where there is no footway, a soft verge of 1 m \(minimum\) width  
should be provided for the accommodation of services \(water, gas,  
electricity, communications, etc.\) and to allow for vehicular over-  
hang. This dimension would need to be increased depending on  
the range and size of utilities to be provided – reference should be  
made to National Joint Utilities Group guidance.  
**38.16** *Acceptable gradients for cycle tracks*  
# 5 CYCLE ROUTES AND CYCLE PARKING  
# 5.1 Scope and guidance  
This section mainly applies to off-road cycle provision. Guidance  
on this, and the complexities of on-carriageway and junction  
cycling provision, is found in the Department of Transport’s  
Local Transport Notes 2/08 and 1/12, and in Transport for  
London’s London Cycling Design Standards and in Sustrans  
publications.  
# 5.2 Gradients  
Cyclists will avoid steep gradients. Studies show that if gradients  
exceed 5 per cent there will be a sharp drop in the length of uphill  
grade that cyclists will tolerate. Figure 38.16 illustrates commonly  
accepted maximum uphill grades based on length of grade; down-  
hill gradients of 6.5 per cent are acceptable. Note that this does  
not apply to ramps to subways and foot/cycle bridges where the  
maximum gradient should normally be 5 per cent.  
**38.15** *Typical recommended dimensions for use in urban areas*  
# 5.3 Width  
Factors to consider when determining widths for cycle tracks must  
include\:  
• Dimensions of the cyclist and the bicycle  
• Manoeuvring space required for balancing  
• Additional clearance required to avoid obstacles  
• Buffer zones between the cycle facility and the carriageway  
• Gradient – where this is steep, additional width is helpful  
• Whether on lightly used routes, a substandard width facility is  
better than none.  
Local Transport Note 1/12 summarises minimum widths for  
off-carriageway cycle tracks as follows\:  
• Unsegregated shared-use\: 3 m minimum  
• Pedestrian path unbounded on at least one side\: 1.5 m \(actual\)  
• Pedestrian path bounded on both sides\: 2 m \(actual\)  
• One-way cycle track\: 2 m minimum  
• Two-way cycle track\: 3 m minimum.  
Cycle track widths should also be informed by the anticipated vol-  
umes of pedestrians and cyclists. Additional clearance is required  
when there are edge restraints to maintain effective widths\:  
• Flush or near-flush surface\: no additional width needed  
• Kerb up to 150 mm high\: add 200  
• Vertical feature from 150–600 mm high\: add 250  
• Vertical feature above 600 mm high\: add 500  
• Buffer zones between the cycle facility and the carriageway.  
In almost all cases, two-way travel will occur on cycle tracks  
regardless of design intentions; appropriate widths should be  
provided. Various paths are shown in Figures 38.17, 38.18 and  
38.19.  
# 5.4 Surfacing  
A separate cycle track should have a high quality smooth surface  
and have a thickness capable of supporting maintenance vehicles.  
Asphalt, concrete, gravel and stabilised earth are materials com-  
monly used. Machine-laid surfaces are preferred for cycle tracks as  
it is often difficult to achieve a satisfactory surface that is comfort-  
able for cyclists. Unbound surfaces are not recommended unless on  
very quiet routes.  
# 5.5 Drainage  
Surfaces should have a crossfall of between 1 and 2.5 per cent to  
provide positive drainage. Drainage grilles should have their slots  
at right angles to the cyclists’ line of travel and be designed and  
located to minimise danger. **Streets and spaces for people and vehicles 38-13**  
# 5.6 Cycle parking  
Planners and designers should consider providing secure parking  
suitable for cargo cycles, inclusive/special cycles, tricycles and  
trailers. These larger bikes can be accommodated within buildings,  
shelters, cages or compounds if they have wide door openings and  
step free access. They can also be accommodated in clusters of  
tubular stands \(e.g. ‘Sheffield’ type\) if they are arranged in short  
runs with large gaps between clusters, so that larger cycles can be  
secured on the end stands, Figure 38.20, or in certain situations,  
wall bars, Figure 38.21. Figures 38.22 to 38.25 show arrangements  
where larger numbers of cycles are expected. See Section 6 for  
suggested scale of cycle parking provision.

**38.18** *Two-way cycle track on separated right-of-way*  
# 6 PARKING  
# 6.1 General  
A clear parking policy for each area is an essential. Many facilities  
now provide little or no parking in order to discourage the use of  
private transport. This is only effective if it is clearly impossible to  
park on the adjacent roads, and if there is adequate public transport  
available. Consider also the needs of disabled people.  
**38.19** *Shared-use footway/cycle track* **38-14 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
There are no statutory requirements and few guidelines for  
the scale of parking provision. Table V gives recommenda-  
tions, but each specific case should be examined to determine  
expected requirements. Some planning authorities now restrict  
parking provision for cars in order to give a measure of restraint  
to traffic.  
Table V also includes recommendations for the scale of bicycle  
parking. These are quite generous so as to encourage greater use  
of bicycles. However, account should be taken of the local condi-  
tions – in places where there are substantially more bicycles than  
average, greater provision should be made.  
# 6.2 Domestic garages  
The domestic garage is the basic provision for residential areas.  
This can be\:  
• Within the envelope of the house or block of flats  
• A separate detached building  
• One of a number in a garage court.  
*Figures 38.26 to 38.32 show a number of typical arrangements*.  
**38.22** *It is important that arrays of Sheffield stands make best use*  
*of space. Attempts at closer spacing than shown will not succeed*

*term parking is required*

**38.28** *Garage for a driver who is a wheelchair user*  
**38.26** *A domestic garage of minimum dimensions*

*workbench* **38-16 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
**38.31** *A garage with a workbench at the end*  
# 6.3 Car parks  
Once the scale of provision has been decided, the form will depend  
on the size and shape of the available area, and also on the type of  
vehicle expected. Figures 38.33 and 38.34 give examples of var-  
ious arrangements, but again, these should be taken purely as a  
guide. While the standard bay size has historically been 2.4 m by  
4.8 m, some new car parks include bays of 2.5 m by 5 m either as  
standard or in small numbers to reflect the trend towards larger car  
sizes. This type of car park assumes that vehicles arrive and leave  
in a random fashion. In some situations, such as sporting events, a  
dense arrangement can be adopted which means that all vehicles  
have to leave approximately in the sequence in which they arrived.  
Figure 38.35 shows various types of multi-storey garage. No  
dimensions are shown as these vary with the site. An additional  
type, not illustrated, incorporates a mechanical stacking system  
operated by attendants. In practice, this rarely shows any advantage  
over conventional types.  
Wherever public or private parking facilities are provided,  
appropriate arrangements for disabled people, whether drivers or  
passengers, should be made. Disabled parking bays should be as  
close as possible to the place that the user needs to go, and prefera-  
bly under visual supervision to discourage misuse by others. Bays  
should be at least 800 mm wider than standard, to permit manoeu-  
vring of wheelchairs for transfer, and any kerbs should be ramped.

Loading Guidance – January 2017, 2nd edition’.  
# 8 SHARED SPACE  
# 8.1 Principles  
The emerging principles behind the concept of shared space for  
the design of streets and public spaces relies on a clear distinc-  
tion between two worlds, that of the highway and of public space.  
Both demand fundamentally contrasting characteristics. On the one  
hand, the high-speed, single-purpose, regulated and standardised  
world of the highway; on the other, the low-speed, multi-purpose,  
contextual and socially defined qualities of the public realm. The  
contrasting characteristics can be summarised in Table VI.  
**38.39** *Finger dock, where manoeuvring depth is limited and side*  
*loading is required as well as end loading. Very fast turnround*  
*times are possible although capacity is small* **Streets and spaces for people and vehicles 38-21**  
Behavioural psychologists have noted that drivers’ speed and  
responses are largely determined by perceptions of time, and our  
expectations of progress. In the highway world, high speeds are  
part of ‘system time’, based on anticipation of arrival at a destina-  
tion at a particular time. By contrast, public space is governed by  
‘context time’, where interest in people and surroundings triggers  
the brain to expect and demand low speeds to allow time for inter-  
pretation and localised responses.  
Shared space is a term used to describe the shift towards the  
use of ‘context time’ to achieve the safe and efficient integration  
of vehicular traffic into the streets and spaces that constitute the  
public realm, Figure 38.42. In practice, this requires a combination  
of design elements and an understanding of the spatial and dimen-  
sional implications of low-speed design. Key themes are set out in  
Sections 8.2–8.6.  
# Table VI Characteristics of highway and public realm  
**38.40** *Ramp on a sharp curve, such as access to a shopping*  
*centre loading dock. Maximum gradients 10 per cent on straight,*  
*7 per cent on inner kerb*  
# The highway Public realm

Predictable, consistent, certain Unpredictable, intriguing, ambiguous  
Standardised Contextual  
Interpreted through signs and markings Multi-layered human communication  
**38.41** *Headroom criteria for covered loading docks*  
# 8.2 Gateways or transition spaces  
The interface between the two worlds of the highway and public  
space calls for careful treatment, for example at the entry point into  
a town or village. This requires clarity and consistency. The change  
of scale from high speed to low speed can be achieved through a  
combination of tighter dimensions, materials, lighting, planting and  
landscaping, public art and place-making. Consistency between  
**38.42** *Shared space at Exhibition Road in South Kensington, designed by Dixon Jones with Project Centre and Hamilton-Baillie*  
*Associates for the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea* **38-22 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
highway measures and the town’s architecture and morphology  
is essential. The transition, Figure 38.43, from highway to shared  
space requires road markings such as centre lines to end, and the  
introduction of lower-height, place-specific lighting in place of  
standard highway masts.  
# 8.3 Visual narrowing  
Driver speeds are largely determined by perceptions of carriageway  
widths. Reducing the apparent width of the vehicular carriageway  
is one element in creating the necessary low-speed environment  
for shared space. An edge strip installed parallel to the kerb, in a  
material close in tone, texture and colour to the footway, can suc-  
cessfully reduce the perceived width of carriageway, Figure 38.44.  
For low speeds, a two-way carriageway of around 6 m can be  
reduced to an apparent width of 5 m with the inclusion of twin edge  
strips of 500 mm.  
**38.43** *Village transition \(Hamilton-Baillie Associates\)*  
# 8.4 Edge friction  
Vehicle speeds are also determined by the richness of informa-  
tion and activity in the driver’s peripheral vision. Where high  
speeds are expected on highways such as motorways, the edge  
conditions are maintained as empty and blank as possible. By  
contrast, low-speed environments can be created by enriching  
the carriageway edge with as much activity, variation and inter-  
est as possible. Vertical elements such as trees or lamp columns  
can combine with spill-out from shops or pavement activity to  
create edge friction.  
# 8.5 Central medians  
One method of increasing edge friction is to introduce a central  
strip to separate the opposing carriageways. Such a strip can be  
helpful in minimising the crossing distance and number of nego-  
tiations pedestrians have to undertake, allowing a street to be  
crossed in two phases. A median strip, Figure 38.45, can be of any  
width, but it is often helpful to allow 2 m in order to accommo-  
date transverse bicycle parking or tree planting. Lighting columns  
can be well placed on a median strip, providing a useful change in  
arrangements at the transition point.  
# 8.6 Junction design  
The move from segregated towards integrated traffic design allows  
for greater creativity in the design of intersections, which often  
lie at the heart of the community. All too often such spaces are  
**38.44** *Cross-section showing narrowing of carriageway width*  
*perception \(Hamilton-Baillie Associates\)*  
dominated by traffic infrastructure. Junctions work more efficiently  
the lower the approach speed of vehicles and the less interference  
is generated by pedestrian crossings. Lower design speeds remove  
the need for signal control, saving long-term capital and revenue  
costs for the local highway authority. Shared space junction design  
strategies include\:  
• Creating low approach speeds. This will often require the intro-  
duction of entry lobbies some 80–120 m distant from the main  
junction in order to establish appropriate driver expectations.  
• Inclusion of a central feature, such as an obelisk, statue, foun-  
tain, tree or lamp around which traffic can circulate. Where the  
available space is limited, a simple roundel or geometrical pat-  
tern in the junction can be helpful.  
• Avoiding the formality of a mini-roundabout. This helps main-  
tain place qualities and increases driver awareness of fellow  
street users. The use of tracking software to establish the turn-  
ing capabilities of large vehicles can be helpful, although lower  
speeds can allow much tighter dimensions than standard pro-  
grams allow. A 25 m diameter circle is usually the minimum  
required to allow large HGVs to turn through 180°.  
• For busy intersections, it is helpful to set pedestrian courtesy  
crossings back 5 m from the junction entry point to allow a vehi-  
cle to be free to negotiate solely with other drivers on entering a  
junction. This set back has to be balanced with minimising any  
deviation in pedestrian desire lines. **9 PLACE-MAKING**  
# 9.1 Benefits  
The art of place-making is key to successful urban design and plan-  
ning and traffic management. Simple measures can help transform  
a featureless linear street into a rich sequence of places, punctuating  
and enriching the driver’s understanding of context. The position-  
ing of a tree, fountain or lamp in the centre of an intersection can  
help create a place, or merely the inclusion of a notional frame  
around a space using setts, blocks or contrasting paving. Special  
lighting and the disposition of street furniture are also valuable  
ingredients in place-making.  
# 9.2 Streets and buildings  
Conventional segregated highways bear no relationship to the  
buildings they serve or the activities such buildings generate.  
Integrated street design seeks to establish a close relationship  
between the context of a street’s surroundings and the design of  
the street itself. Thus, a street might vary its design and form in  
response to the presence of a school, park, pub, church or major  
building. Finding creative ways to establish such conversations is  
central to current good practice in street design.  
# 9.3 Pedestrian movement  
Good street design begins with establishing a clear picture of the  
likely pedestrian flow patterns, the ‘desire lines’, established by  
key pedestrian attractors. Research by Space Syntax and others has  
highlighted the need to avoid sharp changes in directions in order to  
provide the legibility and confidence pedestrians demand. Barriers  
such as guard rails, high kerbs, bollards and highway clutter should  
be avoided wherever possible. Pedestrian crossings should be posi-  
tioned where desire lines suggest pedestrians will wish to cross  
traffic. Most often this will not be orthogonal to the flow of traffic  
\(as in conventional formal crossings\), but is more likely to reflect  
the diagonal movements associated with pedestrian movement.  
# Streets and spaces for people and vehicles 38-23  
Lower speeds in shared space allow for greater use of ‘courtesy  
crossings’ – the use of paving material and lighting to highlight  
to drivers where people are likely to wish to cross. Keeping the  
width of carriageway where pedestrians cross to an absolute mini-  
mum \(3 m per lane\) is critical in minimising the disruption to traffic  
flows and encouraging easy pedestrian movement.  
# 9.4 Designing for cyclists  
A guide to good design and infrastructure for cyclists is provided  
in Section 5. Where speeds are sufficiently low to minimise the  
differential between motor traffic and cyclists, informal sharing of  
the carriageway becomes more feasible. The presence of cyclists is  
helpful in establishing the informal negotiations and mutual aware-  
ness central to shared space. Where one-way streets for motor  
traffic cannot be avoided, measures should be introduced to allow  
two-way flows for cyclists. Off-carriageway, traffic-free links and  
connections form a critical part in a comprehensive network for  
cyclists. Only where speeds or traffic volumes are over-dominant  
in a given street or space should separate lanes be marked out on  
carriageways or on shared-use footways, where widths should not  
be lower than 1.2 m.  
# 9.5 Designing for people with disabilities  
Current street design continues to seek creative means to allow and  
foster universal access to as much of the built environment as pos-  
sible. Establishing low speeds is the most critical factor above all  
in achieving such universal access. The quality of experience and  
confidence of people with disabilities requires an environment that  
fosters an awareness and alertness of drivers towards individual  
circumstances. Elements such as courtesy crossings, supplemented  
tactile or physical measures to ease navigation and orientation,  
combined with a clear understanding of the importance of land-  
marks, sound, paving surfaces, lighting, sunlight and many other  
clues, can minimise the barriers facing those with disabilities.  
**38.45** *Median strip in the centre of Oxford* **38-24 Streets and spaces for people and vehicles**  
# 9.6 Street furniture  
Street furniture and planting can be central to successful place-mak-  
ing and can help establish the overall design approach appropriate  
to the context. The arrangement, positioning and design of the  
benches, litter bins, lighting columns, bicycle parking and other  
items of street furniture are best considered as an integral part of  
the overall design, rather than left until last. Wherever possible,  
any necessary signing can be designed into the street furniture to  
minimise clutter.  
# 10 CASE STUDY\: POYNTON  
# 10.1 Introduction  
Poynton is a small market town between Stockport and Macclesfield  
in Cheshire. It is a crossroads settlement, centred around the inter-  
section of the busy north – south London Road, with the east – west  
Chester Road. Park Lane, the town’s main high street, runs east-  
wards from the main intersection of Fountain Place.  
In 2007, the decline in economic activity had become critical  
for the future of the town, with over half of its high street shops  
standing vacant.  
# 10.2 Traffic blight  
This retail decline was partly associated with the poor quality of  
street design and layout in Park Lane. But the more significant fac-  
tor was the bifurcation of the residential community caused by the  
heavy traffic and wide, impersonal carriageways of the signal-con-  
trolled junction at Fountain Place. As a result, one-half of the town’s  
residential area, including its railway station, was physically and  
psychologically divided from Park Lane. Heavy congestion and  
delays associated with the traffic signals had generated poor air  
quality, and traffic speeds were a concern. The magnificent parish  
church, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and very popular for local  
weddings, had an especially poor connection to the town.  
# 10.3 New street design  
Street design and a radical approach to traffic management were  
central to the master plan for the regeneration of Poynton designed  
by Hamilton-Baillie Associates and completed in 2012, Figure  
38.46\. This included a redesigned Park Lane premised on low-  
speed, continuous flow traffic. Visual widths of carriageways  
were reduced to 2.6 m, combined with an informal central median  
strip. The signal-controlled pedestrian crossing was removed, and  
a number of diagonal courtesy crossings were introduced. New  
lighting, street furniture and a coherent arrangement for shop fronts  
completed the design.  
# 10.4 Fountain Place  
The second phase of the £4 million project involved re-establishing  
a town centre and a sense of place at the Fountain Place junction,  
Figure 38.47. This was the first time that shared space principles had  
been applied to a major junction with such high volumes of traffic.  
Removal of the traffic signals and the introduction of low-speed,  
shared space arrangements allowed significantly greater space to be  
allocated for pedestrians, including a key space outside the church  
gate. All road markings, signs and signals were removed, and new  
gateways were created on each of the four approaches to the junc-  
tion. Fountain Place was laid out as two interconnected circles in  
a granite block paving pattern, marked by informal roundels, to  
reinforce the sense of place, Figure 38.48.  
# 10.5 Impact  
Within 10 months, all remaining vacant shops had been successfully  
let, and footfall has increased by around 80 per cent. Congestion  
levels fell more dramatically than expected, Figure 38.49, and jour-

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
Air travel is now available to many more people than ever before  
in its relative short history. As a result, airport terminals are now  
major public buildings and accommodate diverse functions from  
the social to the commercial as well as processing departing and  
arriving passengers. These buildings can be part-theatre, part-urban  
plaza, part-museum, part-shopping mall and part-leisure centre.  
Serving as gateways, both literally and figuratively, these buildings  
have become important emblems for nations as well as major trans-  
port processors. As their size, critical, social and commercial mass  
increase, airport terminals become ideal centres for major transport  
interchanges, capturing large movements of people, many of whom  
may not necessarily be travelling by air.  
# 2 AIRPORTS  
# 2.1 History  
The airport terminal has been an established building type for only  
90 years since London’s first airport at Croydon, but many typolo-  
gies have evolved. The rapid development of air travel has meant  
that buildings have swiftly become obsolete and needed either  
replacement or reconstruction.  
A notable early example is the original terminal at Gatwick  
Airport, Figure 39.1 that offered passengers in 1936 a direct and  
sheltered route from railway to terminal and from terminal to aer-  
oplane. It was therefore an early true transport interchange facility.

# 2.2 Airport terminal planning  
There are two major influences on airport and terminal size\:  
• Passenger demand  
• Airline traffic scheduling.  
# 2.3 Airport terminal capacity and size  
Passengers per year and passengers per hour are the key factors  
in terminal design. Large peak concentrations will produce a high  
hourly demand in relation to the annual traffic. A substantial con-  
stant traffic level will produce a high annual rate in relation to the  
hourly demand.  
Global air travel is growing on average by 5–6 per cent every  
year and estimates suggest that passenger numbers will continue to  
increase by 3–5 per cent annually for the foreseeable future.  
Sophisticated mathematical models can be used to represent the  
flow of passengers. Where appropriate, standards are applied to  
various future times such as 5 and 10 years ahead.  
The term *standard busy rate* \(SBR\) is used in terminal design,  
and is the number of passengers predicted in the thirtieth busiest  
hour of scheduled use. This means that for 29 hours in the year  
the facilities will not match up to the requirement, but reasonable  
standards and economy are balanced.  
Other factors to be considered are\:  
• *Aircraft movements*\: number of arrivals and departures per hour,  
aircraft sizes, number of stands for each size or range of sizes,  
passenger load factors.  
• *Baggage quantities*\: number of pieces per passenger, by class of  
travel and traffic type.  
• *Visitors*\: number of accompanying visitors with departing and  
arriving passengers by class of traffic type.  
• *Employees*\: number and proportion for airport, airline, conces-  
sionaire, control authorities, etc. and proportion of males and  
females.  
• *Landside transport*\: number of passengers, visitors and employ-  
ees arriving by private vehicles and by public transport \(bus,  
coach, hire car, taxi, train, light rail, etc.\).  
A very simple rule of thumb for approximating terminal floor area is\:  
• For every one million passengers per annum \(mppa\) the terminal  
expects to process, multiply by this by 10000 m2  
.  
So, a terminal planned to process some 30 mppa will be approxi-  
mately 300000 m2 total gross floor area.  
# 2.4 Type of traffic  
There are three main types of traffic\:  
• *International*\: involves customs and immigration procedures  
• *Domestic*\: does not involve customs and immigration procedures  
so can be simpler buildings  
• *Combined international/domestic*.  
**39-1** **39-2 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.1** *Gatwick Airport Terminal, 1936*  
# 2.5 Type of passenger  
There are two main types of passenger\:  
• *Origin and Destination \(O&D\)*\: Fly to the terminal, which is the  
final destination  
• *Transfer*\: Fly to the terminal which is not their final destina-  
tion, connecting with another flight to travel onward to the final  
destination. This can be either international-to-international  
connections or domestic-to-international \(or vice versa\) connec-  
tions.  
# 2.6 Type of airport  
There are two main types of airport\:  
• *Point to Point*\: Airports with no transfer passengers, that is, pas-  
sengers directly fly to this airport as their final destination.  
• *Hub*\: Airports with a percentage of passengers transferring to an  
onward flight to their final destination.  
# 2.7 Passengers versus planes  
Major airport terminals require large multi-runway airfields. The  
challenge for terminal buildings is to exist within these complex  
environments and remain accessible, functional and amenable for  
passengers and staff. Whereas an air traffic controller may judge  
the success of an airport in terms of short taxiing distances and  
the number of air traffic movements per hour, a passenger would  
use quite different criteria for measuring success. These are all  
focused on the terminal building itself such as general comfort,  
ease of use, legibility of wayfinding and the range and variety of  
services offered. As designers, we must remember that terminal  
buildings are designed for passengers first. The plane must not rule.  
However, airfield configuration is a major influence on the posi-  
tioning, footprint and configuration of the terminal buildings.  
# 2.8 Position of the terminal building  
Many if not most airfield configurations are pre-existing or re-con-  
figured as a legacy from earlier times. Key fixes for any airfield  
configuration are the length and alignment of the runway\(s\). These  
two factors, along with public vehicular access, will be major  
drivers in determining where exactly the terminal will or can be  
positioned within the airfield. Various examples are shown in  
Figure 39.2.  
**39.2** *Examples of terminal building/airfield relationship*  
# 2.9 Footprint of the terminal building  
Emblematic shapes, evocative geometries, all seen from the air,  
do become indelible images representing particular airports. Easily  
identified, these can in themselves form part of the airport’s, and **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-3**  
indeed the city’s identity. However, these forms are not a result of  
simple shape-making. Three key drivers forge the terminal build-  
ing footprint\:  
• *Available site boundary*. This is the plot which the terminal  
building can occupy within the airfield without interfering with  
any aircraft movements on the ground.  
• *Number of contact aircraft stands serving the terminal directly*  
*\(rather than remotely via a coach\)*. This number of required  
aircraft stands is represented in lineal metres and this figure is  
known as the stand frontage. The total stand frontage is therefore  
the building perimeter required to be made available for adjacent  
plane parking.  
• *Maximum walking distance within the terminal*. Set a reasonable  
maximum walking distance for passengers \(IATA suggests 650  
metres from the exit of security\).  
These three parameters will then inform the shape of the ter-  
minal footprint. There is also a fourth parameter – limits set  
by airfield operating parameters such as the obstacle limitation  
surface and runway approach slopes. This will not necessarily  
influence the terminal footprint but will set vertical height limits  
for the terminal. Figure 39.3 describes this process of ‘shaping’  
the footprint.  
# 2.10 Configuration of the terminal building  
There are, however, several configuration types possible, both  
centralised or de-centralised, Figure 39.4. A centralised termi-  
nal, Figure 39.5, is where all the main processing functions are  
located in one zone. In a de-centralised terminal, these functions  
are distributed along the terminal building or even in separate  
buildings.  
Key factors influencing configuration type may be\:  
• *Physical space*\: space may not be available  
• *Airfield needs*\: separating piers from processor may optimise air  
traffic movements, reducing taxiing distance  
• *Economic*\: a large single terminal may be expensive to build but  
a network of smaller terminals may be more expensive to operate  
• *Flexibility*\: the need for phasing and future expansion dependent  
on passenger forecasts.  
Another factor to consider is size. A single terminal building  
processing in excess of 60 mppa will need to be so large that  
it will be at the limits of operating as a single terminal. The  
sheer scale of such a building will require passengers to walk  
very long distances. While this can be mitigated by the use of  
automated people movers \(APM\), this can add complexity to the  
passenger journey. Also, as airports find the need to expand in  
response to increased traffic numbers, it may be easier in terms  
of maintaining an uninterrupted operation to build smaller but  
more terminals.  
This approach has the benefit, particularly for hub airports, of  
conveniently accommodating airlines and/or airline alliances in  
dedicated terminal buildings. This co-location of airlines of the  
same alliance simplifies passenger wayfinding and greatly assists  
with reducing transfer times, as most transfers tend to occur within  
alliances. However, multi-terminal hub airports like Heathrow face  
the challenge of moving transfer passengers from terminal to ter-  
minal, easily and quickly.  
Efficient and speedy connection between terminals and the piers  
served by them is the key to the success of a hub airport, enabling  
transferring passengers to safely make their onward connecting  
flight, ideally in as short a time as possible. This Minimum Connect  
Time \(MCT\) is key. The shorter the guaranteed MCT, the greater  
the number and variety of connections with other flights that the  
passengers will be able to connect to, offering more choice to more  
destinations.

**39.4** *Typical terminal building configuration* **39-4 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.5** *Chek Lap Kok airport, Hong Kong \(Foster + Partners\)*  
Finally, it is worth noting that there are three key stakeholders  
in the running of any airport\:  
• Owner/operator  
• Airline\(s\)  
• Regulator.  
The relationship between these three may vary from country to  
country, and its nature and dynamic may also influence the opti-  
mum configuration of the terminal building\(s\).  
The exact degree of passenger experience and comfort can vary  
dependent on the Level of Service \(LoS\) that is to be provided by  
a particular terminal.  
The latest IATA Airport Development Reference Manual intro-  
duces four categories to classify the service levels of passenger  
terminal facilities\:  
• Optimum  
• Sub-optimum  
• Under-provided  
• Over-design.  
Previous LoS categorisation used the letters ‘A’ \(excellent\) down  
to ‘F’ \(unacceptable\). The new categories factor in waiting time,  
and are not just based on space \(m2\) provision.  
# 3 TERMINALS  
# 3.1 A processing machine  
Terminal buildings are effectively machines processing two main  
movement flows; one for passengers, and one for their baggage.  
Both of these flows move in two opposing directions with departing  
and arriving \(passengers\) and outbound and inbound \(baggage\). In  
hub airports there is an additional ‘cross’ flow or re-directed flow,  
that being for transferring passengers and their baggage.  
# 3.2 Passenger flows  
Passenger flows are governed by a series of processes that are  
required for security and border control, Figures 39.6 and 39.7.  
The processes dictate the sequence, direction and order of  
the flows, but each process also represents a space in which it  
takes place, and it is the series of these spaces that comprises  
the complete passenger journey through the terminal building,  
Figure 39.8.  
The adequate sizing of these spaces is critical to accommodate  
the volume of the passenger numbers so that the flows keep moving  
and bottlenecks are avoided, and also to provide a degree of pas-  
senger experience and comfort.  
# 4 DEPARTURES – LANDSIDE  
# 4.1 Departures vehicle drop-off forecourt \(also known  
# as kerbside\)  
Factors to consider\:  
• *Security*\: consider a suitable vehicular bomb-blast stand-off dis-  
tance for uncontrolled private vehicle traffic. Typically this is  
30 m from the terminal façade to the first lane of traffic.  
• *Commercial*\: the whole forecourt or at least the private car sec-  
tion may be incorporated into the short-term or nearest car park.  
This will require motorists to pay for the privilege of parking  
close to the check-in area.  
• *Baggage*\: baggage trolleys should be available for passenger  
use. For heavy package tours traffic, with coaches setting down  
large pre-sorted amounts of baggage, a dedicated area and route  
to the baggage areas may be desirable. • *Airline needs*\: in large terminals shared by many airlines, signed  
sections of forecourt may be appropriate.  
• *Predicted changes*\: allow for predictable changes in traffic mix  
which may affect the modal split \(the percentages of passengers  
arriving by car, bus, train\).  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: in the case of a combined departures  
and arrivals forecourt a planned two-way rate will be relevant  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: an average of 1.5 minutes may be allowed  
for cars and taxis  
• *Modal split*\: Often influenced by local custom/preference.  
Typical space calculation based on 2000 originating passengers/  
hour\:  
• Number of passengers/hour at kerbside for cars + taxis\: 1000  
• Number of passengers per car or taxi\: 1.7  
• Number of cars and taxis\: 1000/1.7 = 588 per hour  
• Time spent at kerb by each vehicle\: 1½ minutes  
• Number of cars and taxis at one time\: 588/40 = 16  
• Length of kerb per vehicle\: 7 m + 10 per cent  
• Length of kerbside for cars and taxis\: 105.6 m  
• Overall rule of thumb\: 1.2 m of total kerbside \(including public  
transport\) per 10 passengers/hour.  
# Transport terminals and interchanges 39-5  
Figure 39.9 describes a typical landside forecourt arrangement.  
# 4.2 Departures concourse  
Key factors to consider\:  
• *Security*\: entry to the concourse is generally not controlled but  
can be via a pre-security check that requires all persons entering  
the terminal to be searched, both passengers and visitors alike.  
This is required in some countries, for example Russia, India  
and Turkey.  
• *Commercial*\: shopping and catering facilities will be appropri-  
ate here, together with bureau de change \(international terminal  
only\) and including food and beverage provision for persons not  
travelling but seeing passengers off.  
• *Baggage*\: all circulation areas should make allowance for bag-  
gage trolleys.  
• *Government controls*\: access to airside for staff.  
• *Airline needs*\: airlines require ticket sales desks and offices.  
• *Information systems*\: public display of information on flights and  
information desk. There may be an opportunity to provide flight  
information in the forecourt \(if covered\) which allows passen-  
gers to orientate themselves prior to entering the terminal.  
• *Predictable situations*\: provision may be needed for exceptional  
conditions occasioned by delayed flights, with additional seating  
and extra catering space. This is usually a large food and bever-  
age outlet that is designated for this purpose should delays occur.  
**39.6** *International passenger process flow* **39-6 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.7** *Domestic passenger process flow*  
**39.8** *Passenger process flow and associated spaces* **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-7**  
**39.9** *Typical landside forecourt arrangement*  
There are several quantity factors to be assessed\: • *Baggage*\: one or more delivery points may be required for out-  
of-gauge \(oversized\) baggage.  
• Hourly passenger flows\: two-way flow will be relevant where  
there is to be a combined departures and arrivals area.  
• Visitor ratio\: a common ratio in the West would be 0.5 to 0.2 vis-  
itors per passenger \(with even lower ratios for certain domestic  
traffic\) but 2.5 to 6 or even higher in the East or Africa.  
• Estimated dwell time\: a common time would be 20 minutes.  
Typical space calculations based on 2000 originating passen-  
gers/hour are as follows\:  
• Number of people per hour\: 3000 \(0.5 visitors/passenger\)  
• Number at one time \(peaking factor, say 50 per cent in 20 min-  
utes\)\: 1500  
• Space per person\: 2.7 m2 \(LoS ‘A’\); 2.3 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘B’\)  
• Area required\: 3450 m2. Some area may be in shops and catering spaces.  
# 4.3 Check-in  
Traditionally, at check-in passengers showed their tickets, had seats  
allocated and if necessary had large items of baggage weighed \(and  
possibly security screened\) for registration and loading into the aircraft  
hold. However, in recent times the check-in process has undergone  
great change, with most passengers now checking in online from  
home. This means that many passengers arrive at the terminal having  
already checked in and printed a boarding pass with a seat allocated.  
Whereas previously passengers used a check-in counter or desk  
to do all of the aforementioned, the check-in concourse is now gen-  
erally comprised of a three-part check-in desk option\:  
• Self-service check-in kiosk  
• Self-bag drop  
• Traditional \(full service\) check-in desk.  
See Figure 39.10 for the range of check-in options and typical  
check-in desk types.  
Factors to consider\:  
• *Security*\: if pre-security terminal checks are not required \(see  
Section 4.2\) then designers must be aware that the materials  
selected for use in check-in concourse may be subject to bomb-  
blast criteria.  
**39.10** *Check-in desk options*  
• *Government controls*\: a customs check facility immediately  
after bags are checked-in \(prior to the bags entering the baggage  
system\) may be required in some countries \(e.g. South Korea\). **39-8 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
This check may require accommodation for customs officials to  
remove and inspect bags and interview passengers.  
• *Airline needs*\: offices for airlines and handling agents will be  
needed with close relationship with the check-in desks.  
• *Information systems*\: CUTE \(common user terminal equipment\)  
will make it possible to allocate desks to any airline at any time,  
thereby reducing the number of desks needed. Otherwise the  
number of desks required is the sum total of those required by  
each handling agent.  
• *Predicted changes*\: following automated ticketing and issuing of  
boarding passes, self-bag-tagging is likely to be the next advance  
with systems currently in operation in Australia and Ireland, and  
being trialled in the UK.  
There are several quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: if CUTE is in use the total hourly flow  
to all desks can be used to compute the number. Landside trans-  
fer passengers to be included.  
• *Processing rate*\: commonly about 1.5 minutes/passenger, with  
faster rates for domestic passengers.  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: this is dependent upon the number of  
staffed check-in desks for each flight, but all check-in layouts  
have to make provision for queuing. Assume a wait of 20 min-  
utes is acceptable to passengers.  
A typical space calculation based on 2000 originating passengers/  
hour with a central check-in is\:  
• *Number of passengers per hour*\: 2000 excluding transfers and  
including gate check-in numbers.  
• *Equivalent number/hour* \(peak factor, say 50 per cent in 20 min-  
utes\)\: 3000.  
• *Number of desks*\: 3000/40 = 76.  
• *Queue depth might* be 20 passengers at 0.8 m per person with  
check-in desks at approximately 2.0 m centres.  
• *Space per person* \(with a high percentage of trolley use\)\: 2.3 m2  
\(LoS ‘A’\); 1.9 m2 \(LoS ‘B’\); 1.7 m2 \(LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Space per person* \(with few trolleys/average two bags\)\: 1.8 m2  
\(LoS ‘A’\); 1.5 m2 \(LoS ‘B’\); 1.3 m2 \(LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Total queuing area*\: 76 × 2.0 × 16 = 2432 m2  
.  
# 4.4 Security control  
Factors to be considered\:  
• *Baggage*\: hand baggage only at this point. Allow for sufficient  
space prior to the security comb for passengers to prepare for the  
liquid, pastes and gels 100 mL compliance. In this area, allow  
provision of plastic bags and counters for re-packing.  
• *Government controls*\: security control will be the responsibility  
either of the government or of the airport authority.  
• *Airline needs*\: some airlines conduct their own additional secu-  
rity checks; often this will be at the gate \(e.g. American Airlines  
for flights to the USA\).  
• *Predictable changes*\: ever-changing regulations in response to  
the terrorism threat levels make this process susceptible to fre-  
quent change. Automation is another area of change. An auto-gate  
boarding-pass check \(similar to a metro turnstile that scans pas-  
senger boarding pass and permits entry into the security comb\)  
is being trialed in various airports currently \(e.g. Heathrow T5\).  
Full body scanning is also being introduced. This non-invasive  
scan occurs immediately upon passing through the metal detector  
arch. Figure 39.11 shows a typical security lane layout.  
Quantities to be assessed  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: for central security allow for transfer  
passengers.  
• *Processing rate*\: X-ray units handle 360 items per hour, with two  
X-ray units per metal detector archway.  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: this is not calculable, since a problem item  
or passenger can rapidly cause a queue to build up. The secu-  
rity check should not unduly interrupt the flow of passengers.  
In reality, staffing levels cannot totally eliminate queuing, and  
space for a long queue must be provided to avoid obstructing  
other functions.  
Typical space calculation\:  
• Assume one item of baggage or hand baggage per passenger.  
One set of equipment consisting of a personnel metal detector  
and two X-ray units can handle 360 passengers per hour.  
• 2000 passengers per hour, excluding transfers, require six sets.  
• Allow sufficient space immediately after security for passengers to  
gather their bag, replace shoes, belts and items of clothing that may  
have been required to be removed as part of the security process.  
# 5 DEPARTURES – AIRSIDE  
# 5.1 Departures lounge  
Here passengers wait, shop, eat, drink before moving sooner or  
later to their flight departure gate. This may mean walking to the  
gate, or to the people-mover leading to a satellite or the coach sta-  
tion serving remote stands. It may be possible to have an Integrated  
Departures Lounge \(aka IDL\) accommodating both international  
and domestic passengers. If local regulations do not permit this  
integration, then separate lounges must be provided for interna-  
tional and domestic passengers.  
Factors to be considered\:  
• *Security*\: no further security checks will be needed where there  
is comprehensive centralised security at entry to the airside.  
Otherwise, checks may be made at each gate or entry to a lounge.  
• *Commercial*\: there will be shopping and catering facilities here,  
particularly duty free.  
• *Airline needs*\: airlines will have specific requirements at the  
gates. They often have CIP \(commercially important passengers\)  
lounges for first-class and business-class passengers.  
• *Information systems*\: full information on flight numbers, depar-  
ture times, delays and gate numbers must be provided throughout,  
but especially at the entries. Take care with the positioning of  
these to avoid the creation of congestion spots, as passengers  
will congregate at these screens.  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: include landside and airside transfers.  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: commonly about 30 minutes.  
Typical space calculation based on 2000 originating passengers/hour\:  
• *Passengers per hour*\: 2000 excluding transfers.  
• *Passengers at one time*\: 1000.  
• *Space per person*\: 2.7 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘A’\); 1.9 m2 \(IATA LoS  
‘B’\); 2.3 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Area required*\: 2300 m2. Some may be in shops and catering  
spaces.  
A very simple rule of thumb for approximating retail floor area is\:  
• For every one million passenger per annum \(mppa\) the terminal  
expects to process, multiply by this by a range of 300 to 1000 m2  
.  
So a terminal planned to process some 30 mppa will should have  
approximately between 9000 to 30000 m2 of retail space. **5.2 Gate holding areas**  
These should be able to hold 80 per cent of the number of passen-  
gers boarding the largest aircraft which can dock here\:  
• *Space per person* \(LoS A\)\: 1.4 m2  
.  
• *Area for 400-seater aircraft*\: 320 × 1.4 = 448 m2  
.  
# 6 ARRIVALS – AIRSIDE  
# 6.1 Immigration check\: factors to be considered  
• *Security*\: none.  
• *Government controls*\: national policy determines the allocation  
of separate channels for different passport holders. There may  
also be checks here for which offices \(with viewing platforms\),  
interview and detention rooms will be required.  
• *Predictable changes*\: changes to border controls within the  
European Union are an example of the effect of international  
policy making. The introduction of biometric ‘chip’ passports  
has enabled an automated immigration clearance system, not  
dissimilar to a turnstile system in some airports.  
• *Other*\: in certain countries \(e.g. Gulf States\), allow for provision  
of a visa counter prior to the immigration queue. This permits  
passengers to purchase their visa on landing.  
Layout for a typical immigration desk is shown in Figure 39.12.  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: include landside transfers.  
• *Processing rate*\: commonly 0.5 min/passenger for departing,  
1–1.5 min for arriving.  
Typical space calculation based on 2000 originating passengers/  
hour\:  
• Number of passengers per hour\: 2000 excluding transfers  
• Number of desks required\: 17 \(departing\); 50 \(arriving\)  
• Area required\: 2.4 m2 including gangway per desk.

# Transport terminals and interchanges 39-9  
# 6.2 Baggage reclaim  
Here passengers await and reclaim their luggage which has been  
unloaded from the aircraft while they have been through the termi-  
nal and passing through the immigration control.  
**39.12** *Typical immigration desk layouts showing a\) Frontal*  
*presentation, b\) Side presentation*  
Factors to consider\:  
• *Baggage*\: some means of delivering outsized luggage to the pas-  
sengers is required.  
• *Information systems*\: display the numbers of reclaim units  
against the arriving flight numbers, particularly where passen-  
gers enter the reclaim area.  
• *Trolleys*\: considerable space will be required for trolley maga-  
zines, ensuring all passengers have access to a trolley. Trolley  
recirculation should also be considered.  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: passengers transferring on the landside  
need to reclaim their baggage.  
• *Processing rate*\: there are several ways of calculating throughput  
in baggage reclaim, but the one used here is from the *IATA Airport*  
*Terminals Reference Manual*. Reclaim devices should have a length  
of 30–40 m for narrow-bodied aircraft, 50–100 m for wide-bodied.  
Average occupancy times are 20 and 45 minutes respectively.  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: Commonly about 30 minutes.  
• *Number of checked-in bags per passenger*\: average 1.0, depend-  
ing on whether the flight is long haul or short haul, although the  
flow calculation method used does not depend upon this factor.  
Typical space calculation based on 2000 terminating passengers/hour.  
The important calculation is for the required number of reclaim  
units and the space round each for a flight load of passengers waiting\:  
• *Number of passengers per hour*\: 2000 excluding transfers.  
• *Number of passengers* per narrow-bodied aircraft at 80 per cent  
load factor\: 120.  
• *Number of passengers* per wide-bodied aircraft at 80 per cent  
load factor\: 280. **39-10 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.13** *Examples of baggage reclaim belts*  
• *Number of narrow-bodied devices*\: 1000 ÷ \(3 × 120\) = 2.7, say 3.  
• *Number of wide-bodied devices*\: 1000 ÷ \(1.33 × 280\) = 2.7, say 3.  
• *Space per person*\: 2.0 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘B’\); 1.7 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Waiting area for narrow-bodied device*\: 240 m2 \(IATA LoS  
‘B’\); 204 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Waiting area for wide-bodied device*\: 560 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘B’\);  
476 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘C’\).  
• *Total waiting area*\: 2040–2400 m2 \(excluding central waiting  
space at entry to baggage reclaim area\).  
The two main types of reclaim installations are the oval and race-  
track, Figure 39.13.  
# 6.3 Customs  
Factors for consideration\:  
• *Security*\: none specifically. Self-sorting of passengers is now  
the norm in the EU with passengers selecting one of three chan-  
nels \(red, green and blue – red for passengers with something  
to declare, green and blue being for passengers with nothing to  
declare, and depends on their originating flight – blue is from the  
EU, green is from destinations other than EU\).  
• *Government controls*\: offices with viewing windows \(one-way\),  
interview and search rooms will be required.  
• *Predictable changes*\: non-intrusive scanning equipment \(e.g. for  
explosives and/or drug detection\) is being introduced in some  
parts of the world.  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: include landside transfers.  
• *Processing rate*\: allow 2 minutes per passenger searched.  
Space calculation based on 2000 terminating passengers/hour\:  
• *Area required* if rule of thumb is 0.5 m2 per passenger per hour\:  
1000 m2  
.  
# 7 ARRIVALS – LANDSIDE  
# 7.1 Arrivals concourse  
These are the factors to consider\:  
• *Security*\: none  
• *Commercial*\: shopping and catering facilities will be appro-  
priate here, together with onward travel services such as hotel  
bookings, train tickets, rental car desks etc. Includes food and  
beverage provision for persons not travelling but meeting pas-  
sengers and for taxi/private car drivers  
• *Baggage*\: allow for trolley drop-off and sufficient circulation for  
trolley recirculation routes  
• *Government controls*\: none  
• *Airline needs*\: provision of a landside CIP arrivals lounge  
• *Information systems*\: public display of information on flights and  
information desk for meet and greet  
• *Predictable situations*\: provision may be needed for exceptional  
conditions occasioned by delayed flights, with additional seating  
and extra catering space.  
Quantity factors to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: two-way flow will be relevant where  
there is to be a combined departures and arrivals area \(e.g.  
Stansted Airport\)  
• *Visitor ratio*\: a common ratio in the West would be 0.5 to 0.2 vis-  
itors per passenger \(with even lower ratios for certain domestic  
traffic\) and in the East or Africa 2.5 to 6 or even higher  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: around 10 minutes for passengers and 30  
minutes for meet and greet.  
Typical space calculation based on 2000 terminating passengers/hour\:  
• *Number of people per hour*\: 2500 \(0.25 visitors/passenger\)  
• *Number at one time* \(2000/6 + 3000/2\)\: 583  
• *Space per person*\: 2.7 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘A’\); 2.3 m2 \(IATA LoS ‘B’\)  
• *Area required*\: 1340 m2 excluding retail and food and beverage  
spaces. These add 20 per cent to the concourse area, making a  
total of 1608 m2  
.  
# 7.2 Arrivals vehicle pick-up forecourt \(also known  
# as kerbside\)  
These are the factors to consider\:  
• *Security*\: consider a suitable vehicular bomb-blast stand-off dis-  
tance for uncontrolled private vehicle traffic. Typically this is 30  
m from the terminal façade to the first lane of traffic.  
• *Commercial*\: the whole forecourt or at least the private car sec-  
tion may be incorporated into the short-term or nearest car park.  
This will require motorists to pay for the privilege of parking  
close to the check-in area.  
• *Baggage*\: drop-off areas for baggage trolleys should be available  
for passengers. • *Airline needs*\: often a dedicated pick-up area for CIP passengers  
is required.  
• *Predicted changes*\: increased premium services such as limou-  
sine pick-up and associated waiting lounges are a growing trend.  
Quantities to be assessed\:  
• *Hourly passenger flows*\: in the case of a combined departures  
and arrivals forecourt a planned two-way rate will be relevant.  
• *Estimated dwell time*\: an average of 1.5 minutes may be allowed  
for cars and taxis.  
# 8 LEVELS AND VOLUMES  
Smaller terminals may be able to accommodate these processes on  
one level, with departures and arrivals journeys segregated hori-  
zontally. However, depending on the number of mppa the terminal  
building is processing, the processes described in the previous sec-  
tions may be split horizontally over various levels.  
Care must be taken as level changes, while improving large vol-  
ume passenger flows and better accommodating the mix of transfer  
and destination passengers do introduce complexity for passenger  
wayfinding.  
# Transport terminals and interchanges 39-11  
Multi-level terminals do reduce the distance that passengers  
need to travel and allow for better and more direct access to the  
aircraft door \(typically 4m or more above ground level\).  
Another key consideration is how to ‘stack’ the different net pas-  
senger journeys; departures above arrivals or vice versa, Figure 39.14.  
Again, relationship to the aircraft door can be a key consideration.  
Multi-level terminals also provide the opportunity to exploit  
the volume afforded by these tall, soaring spaces. Large dou-  
ble-height spaces within the terminal building provide drama,  
introduce light deep into the lower levels of the building and  
provide opportunities for a collective enjoyment of these cathe-  
dral-like spaces.  
Care, however, should be taken to differentiate the volumetric  
quality of these spaces based on the process they accommodate,  
Figure 39.15. Large, soaring halls welcoming passengers at check-in  
provide real delight and the ideal fond farewell. Again, these large  
volumes airside, in the retail halls of the departures lounge, afford  
a generous environment.  
However, evidence suggests that in areas where security pro-  
cesses are involved, such as immigration, security control and  
customs, passengers respond better to a more controlled volume,  
enhancing the feeling that the process is controlled, robust and  
serious.  
**39.14** *Options for vertical stacking of passenger flows*

# 9 AIRCRAFT AND APRON REQUIREMENTS  
# 9.1 Baggage handling  
Figure 39.16 shows a container \(aka ULD or Unit Load Device\)  
and trailer used to assemble baggage. These trailers are transported  
hitched to a tug \(electric or diesel\) and are combined as a ‘tug & dolly’  
combination of one tug and one, two, three or four trailers \(i.e. tug  
plus one, two, three or four\). The manoeuvring of trains of these trail-  
ers determines the layout of baggage loading and unloading areas.  
# 9.2 Loading bridges  
Figure 39.17 shows three types of loading bridges, otherwise  
known as air bridges, air-jetties or jetways, which connect terminal  
to aircraft.  
# 9.3 Apron servicing  
Figure 39.18 shows apron servicing arrangements with all neces-  
sary vehicles clustered around a parked aircraft. They determine  
the space requirement. Alternatively, sub-apron hydrants and  
power can supply fuel by connection through the loading bridge.

# 9.4 Apron accommodation  
Office, workshop, store and staff facilities will be required adja-  
cent to the apron. This accommodation is generally located at apron  
level as this level is usually not allocated to passenger processes,  
particularly in stacked terminals \(see Figure 39.14\).  
# 10 THE CHANGING AIRPORT  
# 10.1 Low-cost terminals  
Traditional multi-terminal airports are now planning low-cost ter-  
minals within their terminal mix, seeking to provide a complete  
range of passenger options from the one airport.  
# 10.2 Airport as a total integrated transport hub  
Airports are becoming a centre of gravity, attracting greater num-  
bers of passengers from further afield, and in turn collecting and  
distributing these passengers both by air, rail, coach and car, inter-  
nationally, nationally, regionally and locally. Airports are ideally  
placed to serve as major transport interchanges, serving heavy rail,  
metro, high speed rail and coach services, acting as an inter- con-  
nected multi-modal transport hub.  
# 10.3 Airport city  
Airports have long been likened to small cities. Heathrow employs  
some 80000 people on airport, and it is estimated some 250000  
others in related industries in close proximity to the airport. The  
very presence of the airport as an attractor makes land adjacent  
to it valuable. This has led to the advent of the ‘airport city’ with  
landside commercial and cultural developments supporting hotels,  
conference centres and offices, all benefiting from their proximity  
to a busy hub airport. This proximity is convenient for business  
passengers who do not wish to have to travel into city centres for  
meetings, for passengers on longer transits and also for staff. **39-14 Transport terminals and interchanges**

# 11 CASE STUDY  
Pulkovo Airport terminal, St Petersburg, Russia  
Architect\: Grimshaw  
# 11.1 Introduction  
Grimshaw won an international competition to masterplan the  
expansion of Pulkovo Airport in 2007 as part of a team with Naco,  
Arup, Buro Happold and Chapman Taylor. The airport is conceived  
as the gateway to both St Petersburg and Russia and is an expansion  
of the existing 1950s airport to the south of the city. The first phase  
completed in 2013 with an annual capacity of 12 million travellers.  
A second phase will allow the airport to handle 17 million.  
# 11.2 Masterplan  
The new, second terminal at Pulkovo is part of the Airport City  
masterplan which centres on a new sculpture-lined boulevard.  
This forms the Airport Gateway and is designed to be reminis-  
cent of St Petersburg’s wide avenues. The boulevard terminates  
in a large square that fronts the 1950s old terminal to create a  
‘heritage quarter’. The new terminal is positioned adjacent to  
the existing building and can be viewed unobscured on approach  
from most directions, Figure 39.19. A series of new buildings,  
known as ‘The Wedge’, provides a service and business park to  
the airport.

# 11.3 Terminal brief  
The brief was for a new terminal that responds to the rich cultural  
heritage of St Petersburg, the geographical location of the airport  
by the river Neva and the extreme climate of St Petersburg. This is  
characterised by short, mild periods during the summer and long,  
harsh winters with heavy snowfalls.  
# 11.4 Design solution  
The airport is a single terminal of 110000 sqm designed over three  
segregated levels, Figure 39.20a. Conceived as the first and last  
great public space of the city, the terminal’s internal layout consists  
of separate zones connected by individual walkways to echo the  
external layout of islands and bridges that make up St Petersburg.  
The new terminal has 88 check-in counters, 110 passport control  
booths and seven baggage belts. Restaurants, cafes, bars, duty free  
and numerous shops take over 15400 sqm of the internal space.  
Arrivals, Figure 39.20b is on the lower level, with departures,  
Figure 39.20c on the upper level.  
The terminal is designed without the usual bias towards depart-  
ing passengers. Grimshaw’s design brings natural light down into  
the very lowest levels of the arrival spaces, via great skylights over  
the voids between departure islands above, Figure 39.21. This helps  
to provide an immediate orientation for the arriving passenger. The  
arrival areas are designed with exactly the same attention to detail  
as the departing areas, allowing for the same clarity of progression  
through the building.  
# 11.5 Roof  
The sweeping roof is created from a series of 18 m bays, which  
effectively act as large hoppers, shallow enough not to encourage  
gathering snow, but deep enough to provide effective drainage. The  
drains are located directly above the roof’s supportive columns to  
ensure that the greatest snow load is concentrated on the area of  
maximum structural support. The roof lights are positioned above  
the datum line to give them the greatest protection from blanketing  
snow and to enable them to make optimal use of the low angle  
natural light.  
It has a clear span over the landside and airside zones, creating  
column free, flexible rooms. This flowing structure unifies the new  
terminal and aids the intuitive direction of passengers throughout.  
# 12 RAILWAY STATIONS  
# 12.1 Introduction  
This chapter provides guidance for the design of mainline railway  
stations only.  
There has been a growth in railway station projects in the UK  
since the 1990s, driven by the increase in demand for rail travel  
and the ageing of much of Britain’s rail infrastructure. Railway sta-  
tions have complex contextual, constructional, urban design and  
user requirements and these need to be considered from concept  
design onwards. Most railway projects also need to consider the  
civic, cultural and community impact that a station redevelopment  
can have on its surroundings. For all railway proposals, designers  
will need to have a thorough understanding of passenger movement  
and station operation to ensure that an efficient and functional sta-  
tion layout is developed.  
# 12.2 Operational types  
Designers should consider what type of station they are designing  
as part of the preliminary design. One of the most important factors  
is how the station will operate, for example, is it a terminus station,  
a through station or a mixed terminating/through station? Each of  
these categories has different size and arrangement requirements.  
Some operational characteristics are not defined entirely by  
whether or not services terminate at the station. Some stations, such  
as Birmingham New Street, have a majority of through platforms,  
but because of the capacity of the station and the size of the city  
they serve, operate in a similar way to terminus stations. Designers  
should use their judgement to determine which of the categories  
in what follows best describes the particular station under consid-  
eration.  
*Terminus stations*  
Terminus stations are stations where all tracks stop and there are  
no through services.  
• Almost always located in major urban centres at the end of a  
particular line \(e.g. Liverpool Lime Street, London Paddington,  
Brighton\).  
• Tend to be larger than through stations.  
• Concourse tends to be located at the end of the platforms and  
normally at the same level.  
• Passengers tend to wait longer at terminus stations, and are nor-  
mally encouraged to wait in the concourse rather than on the  
platforms.  
• Normally have more retail facilities than through stations with  
few, if any, facilities provided on the platforms.  
• Onward travel is often onto another type of public transport \(bus,  
metro, taxi etc.\) or by active forms of transport like walking and  
cycling.  
• Normally accommodate more operational facilities than  
through stations, including offices for train operating compa-  
nies; facilities for train servicing, staff accommodation, food  
preparation, etc.  
• Few passengers interchange between platforms at terminus sta-  
tions.  
• Often important and distinctive buildings with a civic and histor-  
ical importance beyond their transport function.  
*Through stations*  
At through stations none of the tracks terminate. Most stations in  
the UK are through stations, including most smaller suburban and  
rural stations.  
• Normally located in smaller urban centres, in suburbs or rural  
areas.  
• Tend to be smaller than terminus stations, with less regular train  
services.  
• Normally do not have defined concourse areas, but often have  
enlarged entrances or wider areas of platforms where retail, tick-  
eting and other facilities are located.  
• Passengers normally wait on the platforms.  
• Onward travel by private car is proportionally more common  
than at terminus stations.  
• Normally accommodate few, if any, operational facilities aside  
from those directly associated with the running of the station  
itself.  
• Station entrances are normally located on one side of the station  
only, with bridge or subway links required to access some plat-  
forms.  
*Mixed-operation \(terminus/through\) stations*  
Many stations have a mixture of both terminating and through  
platforms. They are normally operated in a similar way to through  
stations, although this depends on the balance of services, the  
capacity of the station and the size of the town or city served\:  
• Rarely located in rural areas, but can be located in towns and  
major urban centres \(e.g. York, Reading, London Bridge\).  
• Vary significantly in size, but tend to be larger than through sta-  
tions.  
• Concourse is generally located at platform level but not always.  
It is not uncommon for a concourse to be provided at the end of the terminating platforms with a bridge or subway link provided  
to access any platforms separated from the concourse.  
• Most passengers wait on the platforms, although in some mixed  
stations passengers for terminating services are encouraged to  
wait in the concourse while passengers for through services tend  
to wait on the platforms. This is normally dependent on the ser-  
vice frequency and predictability of platform allocation.  
• Normally have more retail facilities than through stations with  
few, if any, facilities provided on the platforms.  
• Onward travel is often onto another type of public transport \(bus,  
metro, taxi, etc.\), but passengers often complete their journey by  
private car, particularly in stations outside urban centres.  
• May need to accommodate many of the same operational facil-  
ities as terminating stations, depending on their location on the  
network and service pattern.  
• Some have significant interchange movements within the sta-  
tion, particularly between through and terminating platforms.  
# 12.3 Rail approach typology  
In addition to the station typology, designers should also consider  
how the station relates to its context. One of the most important  
factors in determining this is whether the tracks and platforms are  
located below, level with or above street level.  
It is customary for the track and platform layout to be determined  
first in the design process, often by specialist railway engineers. It  
is important that the constraints the track layout imposes on the  
remainder of the station design are considered carefully as part of  
preliminary feasibility studies as they will have significant impacts  
on how the station operates, passenger movement and how the sta-  
tion relates to the surrounding townscape.  
# Transport terminals and interchanges 39-17  
*Raised track \(viaduct\) station \(figure 39.22\)*  
A raised viaduct allows pedestrians and traffic to move freely  
beneath without having to cross the tracks at grade.  
• More expensive to construct than accommodating tracks at grade  
but causes less severe severance to streets and less restriction on  
railway capacity.  
• Viaduct is highly visible and can have a negative impact on the  
quality of the urban or rural environment.  
• Can result in an adverse train noise impact on neighbouring  
buildings.  
• Allows a station entrance to be located at street level below the  
tracks, or above street level at platform height, which is less than  
ideal because the station normally has a poor relationship with  
the street.  
*Sunken track \(cutting\) station \(figure 39.23\)*  
This allows pedestrians and traffic to move freely on bridges above  
without having to cross the tracks at grade.  
• More expensive than accommodating tracks at grade, but causes  
significantly less severance to streets and less restriction on rail-  
way capacity.  
• Can still cause severance, particularly in urban areas, but has sig-  
nificantly less visual impact than either a viaduct or an at-grade  
railway line.  
• Mitigates impact of railway noise.  
• Allows a station entrance to be located at street level above the  
tracks, or below street level at platform level \(less than ideal  
because the station normally has a poor relationship with the street\).  
**39.22** *Raised track \(viaduct\) illustrative diagram*  
**39.23** *Sunken track \(cutting\) illustrative diagram* **39-18 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.24** *At grade track illustrative diagram*  
*At-grade track \(level\) station \(figure 39.24\)*  
Lengthy at-grade railway track approaches to stations should be  
avoided. Other than in exceptional circumstances, no new level  
crossings should be built.  
• Cheaper to construct than accommodating tracks in a cutting or  
on a viaduct.  
• Likely to result in unacceptable severance to roads and restric-  
tions to railway capacity.  
• Significant safety issues associated with level rail crossings  
across roads, which are considered unacceptable for new rail-  
way lines.  
• Has no impact on railway noise.  
• Station entrances will normally be located at platform level as  
this allows easy access to both trains and the surrounding streets.  
For a through station, a platform access bridge will be required  
to access some platforms.  
# 12.4 Station arrangement  
There are a number of factors common to the arrangement of all  
stations. Most have pay barriers, or gate lines, dividing the areas for  
passengers with tickets \(paid side\) from the public areas \(unpaid  
side\). Many smaller through stations do not have pay barriers, but  
their arrangement still separates entrance and ticketing areas \(anal-  
ogous to unpaid side\) from platform areas \(analogous to paid side\).  
*Terminus station arrangement*  
Figure 39.25 shows an arrangement for the different zones in a ter-  
minus station.  
*KEY*  
A – The public space in front of a terminus station accommodates  
a number of important functional requirements for the station.  
It is normally the place where interchange between the station  
and other modes of surface transport occur. It allows a space  
for people to wait and meet, and to orientate themselves before  
making any onward journey. It also allows space for passen-  
gers to gather safely during an emergency situation or service  
disruption. It tends to be an important civic space for the town  
or city itself and designers should consider its urban-scale rela-  
tionship to its surrounding context.  
B – The station concourse normally accommodates information,  
ticketing and retail. For termini it tends to be a grand space,  
positioned at the end of platforms. It can also be located above  
or below the tracks depending on context and railway approach  
typology.  
C – Typically, retail, ticket and enquiries offices, and other passen-  
ger facilities such as waiting lounge, toilets, left luggage, and  
so forth, are arranged around the concourse.  
D – Facilities for staff may be required close to the gate line.  
This may just be a small secure room in which to rest  
between work periods, or a larger mess room with kitchen  
and toilets.  
E – Most termini incorporate more than one entrance to the sta-  
tion, allowing easier movement and access to and from the  
surrounding streets.  
F – Termini will normally require facilities for train, rail and freight  
operating companies. They may also require accommodation  
for organisations such as British Transport Police, maintenance  
personnel and food and beverage suppliers. Needs vary from  
station to station depending on the operational requirements,  
but will normally include office space, changing rooms, show-  
ers, toilets, mess rooms, etc.  
G – Larger stations will also require large back-of-house areas for  
functions such as train servicing, retail servicing, waste man-  
agement, food preparation, staff parking, plant, etc.  
H – Platforms for terminus stations normally house few, if any,  
passenger facilities. Depending on how the station is operated,  
it may be necessary to locate accommodation for train dispatch  
staff or train drivers on the platforms.  
*12.4.2 Mixed-operation station arrangement*  
Figure 39.26 shows for the different zones in a mixed-operation  
station.  
*KEY*  
A – The public space in front of a mixed-operation station is sim-  
ilar in function to that of a terminus station. It doesn’t always  
have the same civic importance as a terminus station’s public  
realm, but designers should still consider its functional, urban  
and contextual requirements.  
B – Although typically smaller in scale, the station concourse has  
the same function as that of a terminus station typically posi-  
tioned alongside the platforms at the same level. It can also be  
located above or below the tracks depending on context and  
railway approach typology.  
C – Mixed-operation stations may incorporate some paid side or  
platform retail. **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-19**  
**39.25** *Terminus station adjacency diagram*  
**39.26** *Mixed-operation station adjacency diagram* **39-20 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.27** *Through station adjacency diagram*  
D – Facilities for staff may be required close to the gate line. This  
is likely to be a small, secure rest room.  
E – To access the through platforms, mixed-operation stations are  
likely to require bridge or subway access, ideally located close  
to the gate line, away from congested areas. For new stations,  
lifts and stairs – as a minimum – will be required to accommo-  
date the level change. If the change is greater than 4 or 5 m,  
escalators may also be required.  
F – Mixed-operation stations will require some space for staff  
offices and station servicing, but these areas are likely to be  
much smaller than those provided at terminus stations.  
G – Depending on how the station is operated, it may be necessary  
to locate accommodation for train dispatch staff or train drivers,  
as well as waiting areas for passengers, on the platforms.  
H – Some stations will require an alternative entrance depending  
on the surrounding areas.  
*12.4.2 Through station arrangement*  
Figure 39.27 shows the different zones in a through station.  
*KEY*  
A – The public space in front of a through station is similar in func-  
tion to that of a mixed-operation station.  
B – Through stations may just have an enlarged entrance rather than  
a full concourse, typically positioned alongside the platforms  
at the same level. It can also be located above or below the  
tracks depending on context and railway approach typology.  
C – To access the platforms furthest from the station entrance,  
through stations will require bridge or subway access, ideally  
located close to the gate line, away from congested areas. For  
new stations, lifts and stairs – as a minimum – will be required  
to accommodate the level change.  
D – At through stations the majority of passengers wait on the plat-  
forms, so sheltered waiting areas will be required.  
E – Some stations will require an alternative entrance depending on  
the surrounding area.  
# 12.5 Passenger movement  
Station designs should be based on a thorough understanding of pedes-  
trian movement requirements. The station brief should define the  
anticipated passenger numbers that the station will need to accommo-  
date, as well as the LoS required. Figure 39.28 illustrates the basic Fruin  
Levels of Service. The Levels of Service will vary within a station, with  
more congested areas concentrated close to gate lines, entrances and  
vertical circulation areas. Stations should normally aim to achieve a  
Fruin LoS C, but this is not a universal requirement. To prove the design  
will meet requirements, test using pedestrian flow software.  
**39.28** *Illustrative Fruin Levels of Service*  
Figure 39.29 shows typical run-off zones associated with station  
components. When block-planning station accommodation, these  
zones should be kept clear of main pedestrian routes. The diagrams  
should be used as approximate guidelines only. They will need to **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-21**  
**39.29** *Typical minimum run-off zones associated with station components*  
be tested against a full pedestrian flow model to determine whether  
the dimensions indicated are appropriate for a particular station,  
The run-off zones are cumulative refer to Network Rail Station  
Capacity Assessment Guidance.  
There are some general passenger movement principles that can  
be applied when planning the majority of stations\:  
• Aim to minimise the number and height of level changes required  
to move between different parts of the station.  
• Where up and down level changes are required along a single  
route, design the station to have breaks or level areas in between.  
• Wherever possible, avoid cross-flows between different passen-  
ger movements as this is confusing and causes congestion.  
• Aim to maintain visibility along primary routes from start to fin-  
ish to promote intuitive wayfinding.  
• Minimise changes of direction along primary routes, particularly  
180° turns.  
• Position bridges and vertical circulation to distribute passen-  
gers evenly along platforms, to minimise journey times and  
congestion.  
# 12.6 Platform dimensions  
Figure 39.30 shows some typical platform dimensions for a two-  
sided island platform. To determine accurate platform dimensions,  
designers will need to take account of the rail layout, the passenger  
movement requirements and the size of elements that need to be  
located on the platform. Designers will also need to consider the  
space required by the train when in motion, known as the kinematic  
envelope. Reference should also be made to *DFT Design Standards*  
*for Accessible Railway Stations\: A joint Code of Practice*.  
*KEY*  
A – Zone to be kept clear of structure, furniture and other obstruc-  
tion. Dimension depends on speed of trains. Refer to NR/L3/  
TRK/2049 – Network Rail Track Design Handbook. As a rule,  
nothing requiring maintenance or access such as lights, speak-  
ers, cameras etc. should be positioned within the vertical zone  
1.25 m from the platform edge.  
B – The central platform zone should be designed to accommodate  
passenger numbers as well as any platform structures and ver-  
**39.30** *Two-sided island platform section* **39-22 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
tical circulation. Platforms often vary along their length and  
taper towards their ends to respond to track alignment. As a  
guide, island platforms tend to have a typical width of between  
8 and 12 m.  
C – This dimension should be calculated from the dimensions  
associated with the kinematic envelope of the relevant trains,  
with allowance made for passing clearances. Refer to NR/L3/  
TRK/2049 – Network Rail Track Design Handbook.  
D – Dimension between running edge of rails.  
E – Dimension varies depending on the kinematic envelope of the  
relevant trains and the stepping distance required by different  
train designs. Refer to NR/L3/TRK/2049 – Network Rail Track  
Design Handbook.  
F – Height above rail for 25 kV 50 Hz electrification systems.  
Additional height may sometimes be required. Refer to NR/L3/  
TRK/2049 – Network Rail Track Design Handbook.  
G – Dimension from top of running rail to surface of platform. Refer  
to DFT Design Standards for Accessible Railway Stations\: A  
joint Code of Practice.  
H – Minimum clear height above platform. Any signage or lighting  
should be clear of this zone.  
I – Additional height is required above the platform edges with  
overhead electrified lines. This dimension is for primary Inter-  
City routes. It may be possible to have tighter clearances on  
other routes, or where there is no overhead electrification. Refer  
to NR/L3/TRK/2049 – Network Rail Track Design Handbook.  
# 13 BUS AND COACH STATIONS  
# 13.1 Location  
A bus station is an area away from the general flow of road vehi-  
cles, which enables buses and coaches, to set down and pick up  
passengers in safety and comfort. The best locations are near shop-  
ping centres or other transport terminals.  
**39.31** *Single-decker bus*  
**39.32** *Articulated bus*  
Two particular trends have affected urban bus and coach oper-  
ations\:  
• One-driver buses for economy  
• Deregulation with new companies with new operating methods  
and equipment such as minibuses.  
# 13.2 Vehicles  
A variety of bus and coach types are now used, Figures 39.31 to  
39.33\. Turning dimensions are shown in Figures 39.34 to 39.36.  
A kerbside bus stop in a lay-by is shown in Figure 39.37. Overall  
length is *A + n B + C*, where n is the number of buses to be  
accommodated. So for one stop 44.6 m, two stops 56.8 m and  
three stops 69 m.  
# 13.3 Factors affecting size of station  
Apart from the physical site constraints, station size is governed by  
the following\:  
• *Number of bays to be incorporated* \(the term bay is used in bus  
stations instead of bus stop\), determined by the number of ser-  
vices operated from the station; and by how practical it is, related  
to the timetable, to use each bay for a number of service routes.  
• *Vehicle approaches to the bays*. Three types of manoeuvre  
are used, Figure 39.38. The ‘saw-tooth’ is further explored in  
Figures 39.39 and 39.40.  
The choice of manoeuvre will be influenced by the size and shape of  
the available site, the bus operators’ present and anticipated needs,  
and in particular the preference of their staff. Some will accept the  
saw-tooth arrangement while others prefer the drive-through.  
The required area of the site is further increased by the need  
for lay-over. This is when vehicles are parked after setting down  
passengers, but which are not immediately required to collect more  
passengers. The layout for this should be as for parking, Figures  
39.39 and 39.42, preferably so that no vehicle is boxed in or inter-  
feres with other bus movements.  
Economy of space may be achieved, again dependent upon  
timetables, by using spare bays for lay-over purposes. **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-23**  
**39.33** *Double-decker bus*  
**39.34** *Rigid 12 m vehicle turning through 90°*  
**39.35** *Rigid 12 m vehicle turning through 180°* **39-24 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.36** *17 m articulated vehicle turning through 180°*  
**39.37** *A lay-by with one bus stop, assuming normal urban speed of approach. The transition length of 16.2 m is the minimum for a 12 m*  
*rigid vehicle. Three bus stops is the desirable maximum in a lay-by, the maximum comfortable distance for a passenger to walk*  
*Facilities for passengers*\: these will depend entirely upon antic-  
ipated intensity of use and existing amenities. If, for example, there  
are already public toilets, a bus and coach information centre and  
cafes nearby, then these will not be required on the station con-  
course. However, waiting room facilities may be required with  
someone on hand to give information and supervision. In more  
comprehensive schemes consider\:  
• Waiting room  
• Buffet  
• Public toilets  
• Kiosks  
• Enquiry and booking  
• Left luggage  
• Lost property.  
*Facilities for staff*\: there are invariably inspectors who, as well as  
assisting passengers, are primarily concerned with organising the  
movements of vehicles, and supervising their drivers and conduc-  
tors. If there is a depot near the station then staff facilities will be  
provided there. If not, canteen and toilets facilities will be needed  
for staff on the station site, so that during breaks and between shifts  
they do not need to get back to the depot until they return their vehi-  
cle for long-term parking. Should the depot be even more remote,  
all facilities should be provided at the station and only basic ameni-  
ties at the depot. In addition to those listed previously, these include **Transport terminals and interchanges 39-25**  
**39.38** *Vehicle manoeuvres used in approaching parking bays*  
**39.39** *As the angle of pitch in saw-tooth bays increases so does the distance between each bay when detailing saw-tooth bays*  
**39.40** *Passenger safety and control are particularly important* **39-26 Transport terminals and interchanges**  
**39.42** *Coach park for random arrival and departure of vehicles.*  
*The larger bay size \(4 m\) is necessary if coach parties enter and*  
*leave the coaches in the park*  
restricted site, and conflict between passenger and vehicular circu-  
lation has been minimised.  
# 14 TRAMS AND LIGHT RAIL  
There are a wide variety of these installations. Figure 39.45 shows  
a typical light railcar designed to facilitate use by wheelchair users.  
**39.41** *Bus garaging layout for where the buses are parked in a*  
*pre-determined order to get the maximum number of buses in the*  
*available space, subject to the fire officer’s limitations*  
a recreation area, locker rooms and a facility for paying in takings.  
This would be an office where drivers or conductors check, then  
hand over monies taken as fares, which in turn, are checked and  
accounted for by clerical staff. Secure accommodation for any cash  
that cannot be immediately banked will be needed.  
*Facilities for vehicle maintenance*\: the inspection, repair and  
servicing of buses and coaches is an integral part of an operator’s  
responsibility. Normally such work would be carried out at a local  
depot, with a repair workshop together with fuelling, washing and  
garaging facilities. The provision of any such facility within a sta-  
tion complex is unusual, but not unique. For a new town bus station  
or one where it will be difficult and time consuming to drive to and  
from the station and depot because of traffic congestion, it would  
be advantageous to provide at least a workshop.  
# 13.3 Planning  
Whatever facilities are to be provided on the station site, the final  
arrangement must be carefully planned, Figure 39.43.  
# 13.4 Joint company use  
If two or more bus and coach companies operate from the same  
station, this can mean that different types of vehicle manoeuvre are  
used on one site. Figure 39.44 is based on a proposal for a new sta-  
tion within a centre-town commercial development in the southeast  
of England, and illustrates this. The predominant company \(which  
is a local one\) favoured the saw-tooth layout, while the other pre-  
ferred the drive-through arrangement. Full use has been made of a

change and the need for responsible, sustainable design. There has  
been widespread adaptation of traditional developing world tech-  
nologies by architects working in temperate climates \(Carnegie  
Centre for Global Ecology\). Increasing sophistication in building  
design has become apparent in many tropical countries, especially  
those around the Pacific Rim; and web-based documentation, com-  
munication and transfer of knowledge have revolutionised design  
methodologies in all climates, whilst research has revalidated many  
traditional design technologies prevalent in many climate types,  
including tropical zones.  
Some national governments are dependent on external funding  
to enable them to execute major development programmes, and  
government agendas may, therefore, be diverted or constrained  
by the policies of the donor agencies, which may be single gov-  
ernments \(United States Agency for International Development,  
Canadian International Development Agency \(CIDA\)\), regional  
organisations \(the European Union, Asian Development Bank,

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 ‘The tropics’  
‘The tropics’ are, technically, the low latitudes contained in the  
‘Torrid Zone’ between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, see  
Figure 40.1, but the term is most typically applied to the world’s  
hot, humid, equatorial coastal regions which have high rainfall,  
lush vegetation and, in many cases, a colonial past. For our pur-  
poses here, however, the term can be applied to all climates in  
which the cooling load in buildings significantly exceeds the heat-  
ing load. This extends into the hot dry areas, the composite climates  
in the centre of large continental land masses, and some areas tem-  
pered by warm seas or prevailing winds that are as far away from  
the equator as latitudes 45° north and south. This section provides  
an introductory design guide for architects undertaking work in  
unfamiliar environments and climates. All guidance must be sub-  
stantiated by site-specific data.  
# 1.2 Current agendas  
In recent years, there has been a major shift in design agendas  
worldwide, with increasing awareness of global warming, climate  
# 1.3 Tropical design  
Tropical design is no longer seen as a separate entity, but as good  
design that is attuned to specific variations in climate, construction  
industry structure, culture and socio-economic conditions. A high-  
tech, energy-demanding expensive building can disregard context  
and be built anywhere if funding is available; the harder task is  
to design a sensitive, sustainable, lower-tech, climate-responsive  
building that will serve its intended community well and need little  
maintenance. Ideally, this building should embody cultural mem-  
ory without being a pastiche of the vernacular or colonial model,  
**40.1** *The ‘Torrid Zone’ lies between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Dotted areas have a mean annual temperature of 20°C or*  
*above; grey areas have persistent overcast skies with less than 1600 hours sunshine per annum.*

**40-1** **40-2 Tropical design**  
using valid older principles in ways that suit a modern, urban and,  
in many cases, industrial society. Whilst many developing world  
clients understandably aspire to the twentieth-century, high-tech  
Western model for their new buildings, it is the responsibility of  
their architect to ensure that they are aware of this twenty-first-cen-  
tury shift in thinking towards sustainable models, and to understand  
the options available to them and the potential long-term conse-  
quences of their choice.  
The purpose of this chapter is to provide prompts and checklists  
to enable the building designer working in an unfamiliar region to  
carry out a detailed desk study, having first identified those issues  
that require detailed research. Many of these prompts would be rel-  
evant in any climate, but the details given here highlight tropical  
contexts.  
# 2 DESK STUDY\: FACTORS AFFECTING DESIGN  
# 2.1 Desk study  
It is essential that a wide range of issues be investigated in a thor-  
ough desk study before detailed design work begins. Additionally,  
there will be an enormous range of built and documentary evi-  
dence, knowledge, expertise and experience within the country  
that can be invaluable in ensuring that an appropriate design  
solution is found. By including local expertise within the team, a  
whole range of subtle local factors may emerge, greatly enhancing  
the outcome.  
*Key points to consider for desk study*  
• Identify relevant local planning and building control require-  
ments  
• Obtain current and historical data about the chosen site and  
adjoining buildings and land  
• Commission appropriate site investigations \(include checks for  
archaeology, graves, shrines, wildlife, etc.\)  
• Carry out an environmental impact assessment  
• Study existing local buildings that work, and learn from them  
• Identify sustainable locally available materials, and those that  
are unsuitable, liable to perish, delaminate or otherwise fail, or  
be vulnerable due to heat, off-gassing, humidity, extreme aridity  
or mould  
• Establish local practice with regards to site, climate, culture and  
construction industry criteria  
• Identify and evaluate locally applied passive design-led solutions  
• Check availability and reliability of services and their reticulation  
• Establish orientation, insolation \(sun path data\), rainfall, water-  
courses and prevailing breezes, with particular attention to  
seasonal variations including flash flooding  
• Use local information and expertise  
• Anticipate extremes of climate change, projecting forward  
• Consider long-life loose-fit solutions vis-à-vis the brief  
• Review and revalidate all design assumptions.  
Whenever a building is being designed for an unfamiliar environ-  
ment, the architect must check and revalidate even the most basic  
design assumption, as it might be invalid in the new context. This  
section highlights some areas where research may be necessary.  
Relevant building science data is given in Section 7.  
# 2.2 Climate and microclimate  
Confirm the climate type, Table I, and obtain as much site-specific  
data as possible, Tables II and III. Make sure you understand the  
terms used and are comparing like with like when evaluating data  
from differing sources. \(Annual average temperature is the average  
of the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures. The

based on short-term records. A comparison of historical annual  
rainfall records will show if any cyclical pattern occurs.  
A lot of the current and historical weather data will be available  
on the Web, as will definitions of the terms used, but as weather  
bureaux are often located at airports, which tend to have distinc-  
tive microclimates, these data need confirmation on site. Where  
rainfall is dependent on prevailing winds from one direction, a  
hillside site may be in the rain shadow and very much drier than  
the records suggest. On large projects, it may be advisable to estab-  
lish a weather station on site to verify data and study microclimate.  
If climate change \(see Section 2.3\) accelerates as expected, more  
extreme weather will occur, causing catastrophes of increasing  
magnitude and may lead to disruption of seasonal patterns. In par-  
ticular, extreme storms, flooding, wind, rainfall or drought may get  
worse as well as occur more frequently. Building design and site  
selection need to take account of this.  
*Thermal comfort*  
Thermal comfort is dependent on temperature, humidity, radiation  
and air movement as well as type of activity, clothing and degree  
of acclimatisation. No two people will perceive and describe com-  
fort equally. In a hot dry climate, perspiration evaporates quickly,  
enabling rapid cooling of the body; humid conditions prevent this,  
leading to heat gain and discomfort. Table IV indicates the range of  
bulb temperatures that are likely to be perceived as comfortable at  
particular levels of relative humidity.  
These thermal comfort limits assume that there has been no heat  
loss or gain due to ventilation or insolation. Comparing monthly  
mean maximum and minimum temperatures for known levels of  
relative humidity will indicate whether that particular month will  
have days and nights that are comfortable or uncomfortable due to  
heat, cold or humidity, Table V.  
Various formulae for relating these indicators to design solutions  
have been developed. The most successful of these are the ‘Mahoney  
Historical data • Check local weather bureaux, starting with the  
airport, making sure the data is relevant for the  
specific site. Even small countries can manifest  
several different climate types. Note changing  
patterns and periodic cycles that have recurred since  
record keeping began  
Collect new data • As a priority, collect weather data on site, as soon as  
the site is identified  
Rainfall • Establish the rainfall pattern – peaks, daily pattern.  
Monsoon or ‘main’ rains often recur at the same time  
every day; some areas have a week or two of ‘planting  
rains’ a month or so before the main rains appear  
• In areas with distinct seasonal variations, are there  
two \(or more\) ‘rainy’ seasons \(as in Kenya\)?  
• Are the rains reliable or is there evidence of climate  
change?  
• Is there a known periodic cycle, such as El Niño?  
• Does the rain come from one direction and, if so,  
does this affect microclimate on site?  
• How heavy is the rainfall – does it drizzle for months  
or all come at once in a torrential cloudburst?  
Other precipitation • Is there a risk of hail or snow \(not unknown in the  
tropics\)?  
Storms, sandstorms, • Risk analysis – how extreme are these events, and  
gales, hurricanes, how often do they occur?  
tsunami, tornadoes, • How often are two or more of these events inter-  
earthquakes, flash related, or dependent on other, predictable or  
floods, landslides observable climatic events \(tornadoes and changes  
and other extreme in atmospheric pressure, earthquakes and tsunami,  
weather events hurricanes and landslides\)?

overcast during the rains for weeks on end?

they need venting?

tables’ developed for the UN by Carl Mahoney and reproduced in  
Manual of *Tropical Building and Housing\: Part 1 – Climatic Design*,  
Koenigsberger et al. \(1974\). This remains an important text.  
*Meteorological data*  
Geographers and meteorologists distinguish a wide range of cli-  
mate types in hot and warm climates\:  
• The wet climates can be broadly distinguished by intensity and  
pattern of rainfall, humidity and cloud cover  
• The dry climates by how dry they are, how cold they get in the  
cold season \(for simplicity, referred to hereafter as ‘winter’\) and  
whether what little rain they do get falls in summer or winter  
• The composite climates by the degree of seasonal fluctuation in  
all climatic indicators and whether it gets really cold in winter.  
All these variables are moderated by latitude, altitude, prevail-  
ing winds and whether they are at the centre of large landmasses.  
They can be covered by short lists of three or four types, based  
on data critical to particular groups \(farmers concerned about rain,  
tourists concerned about humidity and clear skies, skiers wanting  
snow\) or broken down into a longer definitive list. The Bureau  
of Meteorology, Australia, produces an excellent range of maps  
showing many different criteria.  
# 2.3 Climate change  
The *Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations*  
*Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*, offers authoritative  
assessment of climate change implications for the tropics. It is  
presented as four documents dated 2013 and 2014, with a fourth  
summary document – *Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report*  
*Summary for Policymakers*.  
These implications are\:  
• Low-lying island nations may be overcome by rising sea levels  
• Future tropical cyclones \(typhoons and hurricanes\) are expected  
to become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more  
heavier precipitation, but the number of cyclone events may  
decrease overall  
• Increase in drought in the centre of large continental land  
masses  
• Increases in temperature  
• Increasing unpredictability of weather patterns.  
# 2.4 Site selection  
Sites and the detailed siting of individual buildings should primar-  
ily be chosen to maximise human comfort and reduce impact on  
local ecosystems. Efficient performance of the building should fol-  
low from this.  
Depending on the specifics of the climate type, buildings should  
be sited\:  
• Close to, and downwind of, large heat sinks such as forests, riv-  
ers or lakes, which lower temperature and screen the site from  
airborne dust and noise  
• Remote from major traffic routes and those industries which  
generate heat, noise, pollution and smells  
• Where they will be shaded by trees or other buildings during the  
hottest part of the day and/or the hottest times of the year  
• Where they will take advantage of the prevailing breezes \(wet  
and humid climates\)  
• Where they will be screened from dust-laden winds and glare  
\(hot arid climates\)  
• Where they will not be subjected to solar dazzle from other  
buildings  
• Where they will not maximise heat gain and glare reflected from  
bright external paving or adjacent buildings with pale reflective  
surfaces \(see Section 7.2\).  
Dazzle off sloping, glazed façades is more likely to be  
reflected horizontally into adjacent buildings or into the eyes of  
approaching drivers. Similarly, it is an offence in some countries  
to use uncoated metal sheeting on roofs, as it can temporarily  
blind airline pilots.  
# 2.5 Site characteristics  
Altitude, aspect, insolation, gradient, prevailing wind, shelter, soil,  
geology, water table, seasonal flooding, vegetation, existing struc-  
tures, archaeology and ecology may all be important. Traditional  
uses of the site for grazing, footpaths or cultivation may all need  
negotiation. Crops on a site may need to be reimbursed to their full  
value if destroyed, or allowed time to be harvested.  
*Pollution*  
Pollution and smells from tanneries and other industries, saltpans,  
open storm drains and sewers, contaminated water supplies and  
aerobic sewage treatment works may present serious problems in  
countries without environmental legislation.  
*Environmental impact*  
Even small projects may affect water supply, unstable soil, fragile  
flora and fauna, and local inhabitants and their patterns of agri-  
culture. An environmental impact assessment may be required and  
should always be considered.  
# 2.6 Site investigations and geotechnics  
*Soils and geotechnics*  
The site may present unfamiliar soil and ground conditions and  
behaviours. In southern Africa, for example, there are no glacial  
soils, there is much more igneous rock than elsewhere, and the  
weathering of the ancient landmass has produced a much higher  
percentage of residual soils. Most of these soils are non-satu-  
rated and many are either of expansive or collapsing types where  
smaller structures need to be lightweight and flexible rather  
than heavy and rigid. Larger structures may need piled founda-  
tions. The absence of ground frost frees foundation design from  
some of the constraints that operate in cold climates, but other  
factors, such as soil type and seasonal cycles of saturation and  
desiccation, may present other problems. In many areas, tropical  
soils are thin and vulnerable to rapid erosion once tree cover is  
removed or the surface exposed or cultivated. Soil stabilisation  
may be necessary, using planting, geo-membranes or gabions. It  
is rare to be working in a country that has not been extensively  
mapped geologically, however, and knowledge and expertise  
should be available.  
*Water supply*  
It may be impossible to ensure an adequate water supply throughout  
the year in dry or seasonally dry climates. There may be aquifers  
that can be tapped using wind pumps, but if water has to be piped  
over long distances or brought in by tanker, a scheme may become  
uneconomic. Ground water must be thoroughly tested by govern-  
ment or independent analysts to ensure that it is potable and free  
from contamination.  
*Water table and flooding*  
The water table may fluctuate seasonally or be altered by other  
constructional or civil engineering works in the vicinity. Flash  
flooding may be a risk in any dried-out riverbed or low-lying  
area and roads may become impassable very quickly. Take  
advice, have up-to-date weather information and be alert to dis-  
tant thunder.  
*Earthquakes and hot springs*  
World seismic data and geothermal activity are well recorded by  
the British Geological Survey and the US Geological Survey. Their  
web-based information is excellent. *Burial sites*  
Traditional burial sites may be unearthed in unexpected places,  
especially where the population is nomadic and the written record  
recent. All graves and religious sites must be treated with respect  
and local advice heeded. Burial sites may be indicated by the pres-  
ence of particular tree species or some other environmental marker.  
*Archaeological finds*  
Archaeological finds should be reported to local museum authori-  
ties. It may be wise when excavating a virgin site to take advice as  
to what to be looking out for, as remains or other finds may take  
unfamiliar forms, ranging from dinosaur eggs, through gemstones  
to rock paintings.  
# 2.7 Culture and religion  
*Cultural and religious criteria*  
Many questions must be asked to determine if these are germane  
to building design\:  
• Is the society homogeneous or divided on ethnic, political, reli-  
gious or economic lines?  
• Are there minority demands which have to be met?  
• Are there strict gender-based criteria?  
• Are there strict taboos with regard to personal hygiene and the  
butchering and eating of meat?  
• Are some castes isolated?  
• Do holy days vary?  
• Does the workplace have to make provision for specific religious  
or social practices?  
• Will shrines be required?  
• Is Feng Shui practised?  
*Historical factors*  
Colonial procedures can be very persistent in former colonies includ-  
ing the former and present members of the British Commonwealth  
and in Francophone Africa, and the former American, Portuguese,  
Dutch and German colonies. Government and legal processes,  
the police, the army and a wide variety of social practices will all  
reflect the past administrators to a greater or lesser degree – as will  
the past and, sometimes, the present architecture.  
*Social and ethical criteria*  
Limited literacy or the absence of a common language may neces-  
sitate a different approach to building signage. If labour is cheap,  
buildings may need to accommodate the proliferation of servants,  
messengers and other service personnel that this permits. In some  
countries, they will be provided with residential accommodation  
on site and will be able to keep their extended families there – with  
implications for power, water and sanitation provision.  
# 2.8 Politics and economics  
*Business practices*  
Are people taking a siesta at midday, when the sun is overhead,  
but working later in the afternoons, when glare from low sun and  
heat from solar gain are most difficult to keep out of buildings?  
Do meetings and other interactions require special facilities? Are  
there regular group activities \(prayers, Tai Chi, mid-morning cof-  
fee, emergency drills\) that need special spaces?  
*Political factors*  
Political instability and conflicting political, ethnic, religious or  
tribal agendas may influence design and affect the buoyancy of the  
construction industry.  
*External aid and funding*  
International debt repayment agreements may skew local economies  
and suppress regeneration. In the recent past, newly independent  
# Tropical design 40-5  
countries received large amounts of unconditional project funding  
as donor governments sought to keep perceived undesirable influ-  
ences out of vulnerable and potentially unstable areas. Much of  
this aid was designed to provide employment in the donor country  
with little regard for local expertise, culture or long-term viability.  
Today, the more enlightened donors support sustainable, self-help  
projects that are intended to support local industries and generate  
wealth.  
# 2.9 Construction industry, job management and  
# professional expertise  
*Labour skills and costs*  
International price guides are now available for most countries and  
provide a good guide as to good local materials, cost peculiarities,  
materials that are difficult to source, labour rates and other cost  
indicators. It is important for architects to be familiar with local  
skills and use them, rather than to impose imported techniques that  
they are familiar with but local artisans are not.  
*Transport, accessibility and infrastructure*  
Transport can present many unforeseen problems on construction  
projects\: vehicle availability, spares, maintenance, drivers, insur-  
ance, risks, road safety, road conditions, bad weather, roadblocks  
\(official and unofficial\) and drivers using official vehicles as unof-  
ficial, uninsured taxis.  
*Access and travelling*  
Is the country easy to get into and out of? Are permits, interpreters,  
guides, cost of flights, taxis, trains, buses or car hire required? It is  
important to develop local contacts and networks, using embassies,  
professional bodies and other agencies.  
*Project management strategies*  
Will these be local, international, co-partnership, via phone, fax,  
skype or online?  
*Planning applications*  
Planning and other statutory procedures may be Anglophone,  
Francophone or downright Byzantine. Local guidance is essential.  
Professional accreditation may be instantly available or complex  
and lengthy to obtain.  
*Cost*  
Costs will be unfamiliar and cost advice from resident consultants  
will be essential.  
# 2.10 Resources and technologies  
*Construction industry resources*  
Availability and reliability of materials, tools, plant, water sup-  
plies, resources, labour, skills, crafts, expertise, organisational  
structures, technologies and reliability of utility supplies will all  
affect the construction process, as will seasonal or climate events  
that affect employment, restrict transport movement or materials  
production, or stop construction \(groundwork may not be pos-  
sible during the rainy season\). Local artisans may be adept in  
special applications of trades such as plastering and rendering,  
which have been lost in much of Europe or the USA. Scaffolding  
might use bamboo – a material worth exploring for a wide range  
of applications.  
*Utilities and services*  
Incoming services may include water \(potable and recycled ‘grey  
water’\), electricity, telecommunications \(including satellite and  
data services\), oil and gas. Availability, reliability, method of  
reticulation and system type all need to be determined. In many  
countries, the very low density of new urban development imposes  
great strain on current and future services reticulation. Outgoing  
services – sewerage \(mains and septic tank\), storm drains and **40-6 Tropical design**  
refuse – may also require non-standard design solutions. In areas  
without supply, alternatives must be considered.  
*Alternative power sources*  
Water \(hydro and wave\), wind or solar power may be feasible.  
Grid-connected building-integrated photovoltaics \(BIPV\) are  
becoming more efficient and better documented.  
*Sustainability*  
The terms may differ – sustainable, ecological, ‘green’ – but the  
principles remain.  
Good building design should\:  
• ‘Touch the earth lightly’ by minimising use of non-renewable  
fossil fuels in collecting, manufacturing, transporting or using  
building materials  
• Reduce the need for the power derived from these fossil fuels  
in heating, lighting, ventilation and cooking by using passive  
design strategies in buildings  
• Encourage lifestyle and working practices that reduce the need  
to consume excessive energy in transport, workplace, leisure or  
entertainment  
• In the longer view, affect urban planning, the nature of residen-  
tial development, the reticulation of services and the policies of  
central governments.  
Sustainable strategies to consider include\:  
• Using local materials – but do not consume beyond the capacity  
to regenerate  
• Making use of local waste products  
• Using passive design  
• Recycling energy  
• Restricting water consumption.  
*Appropriate technology*  
It is dangerous to make assumptions about suitable solutions\: two  
neighbouring countries may appear similar in terms of climate,  
environment and socio-political culture, but may have very differ-  
ent construction industries. One may have good labour, traditional  
brick-making skills, popular decorative traditions, and use steel  
extensively, whilst its neighbour has no masonry construction, but  
builds in cement block and reinforced concrete. One may welcome  
low-tech solutions; another might be insulted by them. Clay ovens,  
sisal-reinforced roofing sheets and modern pit latrines may work  
wonderfully but are unlikely to satisfy people wanting to come  
up to speed in the modern world. Indeed, these solutions are most  
effective when offered to refugees from that modern world who  
wish to experience the ‘bush’ for a week or two. A technology is  
only appropriate if people want it.  
*Transferable technologies*  
High-tech buildings in temperate climates now use design strate-  
gies that originated in the tropics \(cooling towers, vented ridges,  
*brise soleil*\). These sometimes perform less well than expected,  
as temperature variation is not sufficiently extreme to generate  
air movement, but when updated and reinterpreted in the tropics,  
they should work more efficiently. Conversely, temperate climate  
details \(such as thermal insulation\) can benefit tropical design,  
especially in composite climates at higher altitudes.  
# 2.11 Environmental design  
*Environmental comfort within the building*  
Comfort depends on responding to climate specifics – humidity,  
seasonal variations that relate to altitude, prevailing winds and rain-  
fall patterns, and the site and its environs. Higher altitudes inland  
can get very cold overnight in the cold season – some areas have  
snow and frost; houses in the centre of large land masses and at  
altitudes over 1000 m often need room-heating fires in the sitting  
rooms and to take advantage of solar gain in winter.  
*Environmental design around the building*  
Shading, restriction or enhancement of air movement, placement  
and type of landscaping, the use of water, reflectivity of surfaces,  
glare, screening against noise or dust, and seasonal storm protec-  
tion may all be important. Adjacent buildings may produce solar  
dazzle, block air movement or cast shade when it is most wanted.  
Public and private spaces, including car parking, may influence  
light levels, glare and general amenity.  
*Performance of the building envelope in the context of the*  
*local climate*  
Buildings may have to withstand torrential driving rain, lightning,  
cyclones, hurricanes, sandstorms, very high temperatures, extreme  
diurnal temperature variations with associated extremes of thermal  
movement, persistent high humidity, extended dry periods or salt-  
laden atmospheres. Structures that are elevated to catch the breeze  
will need additional structural measures to withstand high winds.  
# 2.12 Flora, fauna and biohazards  
*Tropical diseases and infections*  
With climate change, global public health is declining as tropical  
diseases and their carriers spread into new areas where populations  
do not have natural immunities. Some vector-borne diseases such  
as malaria are increasingly resistant to treatment. WHO offers cur-  
rent information on the most significant diseases on its website.  
*Snakes, spiders and flying insects*  
If the habitat offered by the site suits any venomous snakes, spi-  
ders or insects, make personnel aware of the appropriate remedial  
treatment for bites. Be aware of any risks of diseases, including  
water-borne diseases, and of diseases transmitted by insects. Any  
stagnant or still standing water may carry diseases or their mecha-  
nisms of transmission such as bilharzia \(*schistosomiasis*\) in Africa.  
Plants that hold water \(such as maize\) can harbour mosquitoes.  
Bees and wasps may be very aggressive and inclined to swarm in  
roof voids. Cockroaches can be difficult to eradicate.  
*Mosquitoes*  
Mosquitoes are endemic in the tropics, and several species are  
capable of transmitting a range of diseases \(malaria is the most wide-  
spread\) by transferring infected blood from one person they have  
bitten to the next. Government health departments, tropical disease  
hospitals and international airlines can advise on precautions.  
Many tropical climates have cyclical patterns of temperature  
and rainfall variation, such as El Niño, that recur over a number of  
years. These cycles will affect the water table and extent of open  
water created and, when wet phases are linked to high tempera-  
tures, there will be epidemics of diseases linked to mosquitoes and  
other water-breeding insects. In Australia, outbreaks of Murray  
Valley encephalitis occur at the peaks in the Southern Oscillation  
Index, which coincides with El Niño years.  
*Larger mammals*  
In rural areas, wild animals can cause problems, as can free-ranging  
livestock. Hippos leave the water to go night grazing, elephants strip  
bark from trees and feeding monkeys cause a lot of wilful damage.  
*Wood-boring insects*  
Structural timber and timber furniture may be at risk of disfiguring  
borer attack.  
*Termites*  
The presence of termites may only be apparent if they are of the  
type that constructs mounds or ‘anthills’. Termites can penetrate  
small voids and destroy constructional timbers very quickly. They will also destroy landscaping, stripping trees and shrubs of bark.  
Where they are prevalent, it may be necessary to allow for the need  
to annually replace a percentage of all landscaping due to termite  
damage.  
There are three main types of termites\:  
• *Damp-wood termites* inhabit damp rotting logs or pockets of rot  
in dead or living trees. They obtain all the water they need from  
their habitat and do not need contact with the ground.  
• *Dry-wood termites* are similar to wood-boring beetles found in  
temperate climates. They can fly into buildings or be introduced  
in previously infested timber. They can be deterred by the use of  
\(expensive\) naturally resistant timbers, by pre-treatment of tim-  
ber with a wood preservative and by including physical barriers  
in the design, especially at roof level.  
• *Subterranean termites* need to maintain contact with the ground  
and can survive in drier conditions than the dry-wood termites.  
They present the greatest risk to buildings. They can pass  
through fine cracks in slabs and mortar and construct mud galler-  
ies, linking their nest and a source of moisture underground with  
the cellulose food source within the building. Poorly ventilated,  
damp and dark spaces below floors and around the perimeter of  
the building will increase the risk of infestation. Landscaping  
can conceal activity, whilst disturbed soil or materials stored  
beneath the floor will facilitate it. Naturally resistant timber spe-  
cies are in short supply.  
The options are to destroy the nest or migrating colonies,  
and to use physical or chemical barriers to prevent invasion.  
Chemical use should be by licensed operatives. Spraying of the  
ground or injection of insect-bored holes in timber with poisons  
\(all toxic to humans and/or wildlife and aquatic life\) is generally  
considered the most effective treatment, but it must be contin-  
uous and not compromised by later alterations or additions to  
the structure. In Australia, a fine-gauge stainless steel mesh is  
used as a barrier in any location, including below the floor slab.  
Smooth exposed projecting faces of ground floor slabs \(mini-  
mum 75 mm projection\) can deter invasion and assist detection.  
Regular inspection is essential.  
Materials used in the floor slab and lower courses of walls,  
including hardcore, building sand, mortar and render are also usu-  
ally poisoned with a pitch-based sealing compound, and effective  
sealing of all cracks, joints and holes is essential. Termite shields  
are also used, but can be bridged and may become corroded, need-  
ing replacement.  
# 2.13 Other essential design data  
*Anthropometrics and ergonomics*  
Particular tribal and ethnic groups may have distinctly different  
characteristics, especially with regard to height and reach. If there  
is no data available, arrange for a local agency to obtain it, rather  
than trying to do it yourself – you might unwittingly cause offence.  
Some cultures have different practices with regard to sitting, rest-  
ing and using a toilet.  
*Disabled access*  
Policies will vary, as will the numbers of disabled, especially  
in current and former war zones. Polio may also have left its  
mark. Facilities, resources and equipment may not be widely  
available.  
*Special factors in the design of the spaces around the*  
*building*  
National attitudes to land ownership, landscaping, public access,  
vehicular access and the use of public art can vary greatly. In some  
areas where there are no public facilities, indeterminate public  
spaces and open drains may be used as latrines.  
# Tropical design 40-7  
*Security*  
Risk of terrorism, abduction, mugging, desecration or petty theft  
may be unfamiliar problems that constrain design. Diplomats and  
some nationals in particular, can feel extremely vulnerable and  
demand extreme measures, including ‘safe rooms’. Burglar bars  
and other security measures may restrict means of escape in case  
of fire, boundaries may be marked by high walls topped with razor  
wire enclosing a patrolled *cordon sanitaire*, and gates may be pro-  
tected by armed guards. Lush planting may be seen as a security  
risk, obscuring sightlines and providing cover for undesirables \(see  
also Chapter 13, Crime prevention design\).  
*Landscape design*  
Plant availability, local knowledge and expertise vary hugely from  
country to country – look at the landscaping of public buildings  
to gauge attitudes and possibilities. There may be some protection  
of indigenous flora and restrictions on exotic \(imported\) species.  
Throughout most of the tropics, previous colonial administrators  
and later horticulturalists and landscape architects have imported  
species from all parts of the world. These can homogenise tropical  
landscaping and there is a move towards using indigenous species;  
see Section 4.10.  
Irrigation may be a problem, in which case drought-resistant  
species must be used in dry or seasonally dry climates, where irriga-  
tion should be restricted to designated ‘watered’ beds. Landscaping  
should support the environmental agenda of the building design –  
shade, airflow, cooling, etc. Irrigation will cool the air but raise  
humidity.  
Soft landscaping can harbour insects, snakes and vermin and, as  
a consequence, some clients may insist there is no planting close  
to the building.  
*Rainwater dispersal*  
In any climate where there are frequent heavy rains, it is inappro-  
priate to fit the small gutters and down-pipes that are normally used  
in temperate climates. A short rainstorm may well cause a flash  
flood and the conventional solution in some countries is to dis-  
charge water from overhanging eaves into open dish drains which  
convey the water to large open storm drains that increase rapidly  
in width and depth as more inlets are added. It is imperative that  
these all drain effectively, without leaving standing water in which  
mosquitoes, bilharzia and other diseases and bacteria can flourish.  
In public buildings and cities where gutters will normally be used,  
they must be able to carry the heaviest rainfall or be able to over-  
flow without causing damage or nuisance.  
# 3 CLIMATE-RESPONSIVE DESIGN\: CLIMATE  
# TYPES  
# 3.1 Bioclimatic design  
A careful evaluation of traditional and current aesthetic and tech-  
nological local solutions will help to define the important design  
issues. In particular, if there is a highly evolved, almost iconic tra-  
ditional building form, a detailed analysis of this form may prove  
particularly rewarding. Modern buildings and urban planning have  
usually derived from Western models and have not always been  
successful in resolving environmental problems or addressing  
social needs. The intention should be to reinterpret and add value to  
proven successful solutions, or to come up with different solutions  
that respond more effectively to changes in conditions or scale. A  
clear understanding of the issues and options is essential.  
The international style of architecture seen around the world  
today is often based on temperate climate models and, like vernacu-  
lar dry and arid climate architectures, it is often enclosed, contained  
and defensive – based on solid geometry. Architecture in humid  
and composite climates, however, is often a fluid, unconstrained  
space under a canopy where people move in and out – through voids  
defined only by their upper surface. There is little physiological **40-8 Tropical design**  
differentiation between being ‘inside’ and being ‘outside’ under a  
shady tree. In wall-less spaces, dramatic roof forms can make a  
much stronger statement.  
In climates where much of daily life is conducted outside, it is  
common for buildings to take the form of a series of pavilions set in  
parkland and linked by covered walkways. In more congested sites,  
and where security is important, links between buildings may be  
semi-enclosed breezeways, walled with *brise soleil* or some other  
form of defensive screen wall.  
Generically, designers recognise three main climatic types\: hot  
dry, hot wet and composite \(with seasonal variation\). In reality,  
most locations will have some seasonal variation and overlap with  
other types. Tables VI–VIII summarise the main indicators and  
design responses.  
# 3.2 Design in hot dry and arid climates  
The hot dry climate building needs to be ventilated whilst keeping  
out sand and dust, have a slow thermal response – achieved by high  
mass outer walls and should have small windows at high level, to  
cut down glare and solar gain. Traditional solutions achieve high  
mass by using thick walls of stone, air-dried mud bricks or rammed  
earth \(*pisé de terre*\). The unfired clay usually has a protective ren-  
der or coating that will withstand occasional rain, provided it is  
repaired from time to time. Regional variations using the same  
materials can be quite distinctive – adobe in New Mexico, barrel  
vaults in Egypt or tower houses in Iran. The same unfired materials  
recur in composite climates, but are protected from heavier, more  
persistent rain by deep overhangs, being placed on raised floor plat-  
forms and being repaired every year. In the dry tropics, there is a  
flat roof, often used for sleeping in the hottest weather. Any dense  
material may be used for the thick outer wall. Choice of material  
and wall thickness will depend on the desired time lag of the ther-  
mal response.  
Monsoon climates are rare\: two types – A, with wet and dry  
seasons, the dry being less distinct; B, with an extremely heavy wet  
season and a distinct dry season.  
# 3.3 Design for hot wet and humid climates  
The main requirements here are to maximise ventilation, shade  
and protection from rain, and to have a thin-skinned rapid ther-  
mal response building envelope. The maritime equatorial climate  
exhibits little variation over the year.

# Design solutions  
Individual Buildings are inward looking and defensive with thick walls and small high windows. Building mass should be efficient with as little of the envelope  
buildings exposed to the sun as possible, especially on the west where the afternoon sun is the hottest. Internal courtyards are widely used, with the use of  
water for evaporative cooling and decorative screens to cut down glare. Roofs, walls, windows, terraces and courtyards can be shaded with canopies  
or secondary structures  
Urban development Buildings are packed close together – this reduces travel distances – to markets, shops and services. Adopt strategies that reduce physical effort.  
Narrow streets running north – south will receive least sun. East and west facing walls should be protected from the sun. Wind towers catch the  
breezes and cool the air, drawing it over water into shaded courtyards  
Landscaping Create an artificial oasis by contouring land and planting shelterbelts with drought-resistant species, but beware of blocking air movement. If irrigation  
is possible, other species may be grown. Soil may have to be imported. If so, it will need stabilising and protection or the wind will take it away.  
Use water for functional, decorative and psychological benefits. Shade paved areas to cut down glare **Tropical design 40-9**

be via perimeter verandas\); habitable verandas, some fly-screened; main axis east–west; windows face north and south;  
use clerestory windows, vented ridges and wind towers to improve ventilation; shade trees should have high canopy but  
not block ventilation below the eaves; position structures to catch the breeze; anticipate damp and mould, insects and  
vermin  
Urban development Buildings should be positioned to obtain maximum ventilation; line buildings with verandas, colonnades and covered walkways  
Landscaping Dramatic landscaping is possible, but beware of wind rock in trees close to buildings  
# 3.4 Design for composite climates  
A composite climate has distinct seasonal variation. A decision  
needs to be made as to priorities in terms of climate-response.  
The seasonal variation in sun path can be used to modify build-  
ing response to the different climatic conditions, supplemented by  
movable elements, insulation and mechanical heating or cooling  
systems.  
# 4 ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN STRATEGIES\: PAS-  
# SIVE DESIGN  
# 4.1 Passive versus active design  
There are two approaches to the provision of climate-responsive  
design – passive or active. Passive design is architect-driven and  
architectonic, relying on harnessing climate through the form and  
mass of the building to eschew the need for mechanical or electrical  
systems. It does not usually attract large research grants. Active  
design is the domain of the scientist and engineer\: it is mathemati-  
cal and appears more measurable; and it tends to attract government  
grants, the support of industry \(there is a marketable product\) and  
is used on prestige projects. A mix of both may be needed to get  
the best outcome. Design is becoming more integrated – and more  
pragmatic.  
Passive design uses the careful siting, orientation, design  
and detailing of buildings to ensure that maximum advantage is  
taken of aspect, sunlight, wind, contour and shelter to minimise  
dependency on fossil fuels and externally generated power, heat  
or artificial light. Passive solar design uses fixed elements of the  
building fabric and its environs to manage solar radiation and opti-  
mise natural heating or cooling. The benefits of passive design are a  
more comfortable natural environment, reduced energy consump-  
tion, reduced costs, lower maintenance and long-term viability as  
a building which will meet future higher energy regulations and  
which will remain economic to run as fuel prices increase. **40-10 Tropical design**

Landscaping Many species will tolerate these climates, but may need irrigation unless resistant to seasonal drought;  
risk of frost needs to be determined; termite damage can be considerable  
# 4.2 Shading  
The best way to control solar radiation with passive design  
measures is to use external shading. This must be designed with  
a thorough understanding of sun path data, obtained with the  
aid of a sun path diagram and a shadow angle protractor \(see  
Section 7.1 and Chapter 8, Thermal environment\). Shading of  
buildings, windows and internal courtyards can reduce the cool-  
ing load on buildings and alter ventilation, glare and daylight  
levels. It may affect views out of the building and interiors can  
be gloomy.  
Passive shading may be achieved using\:  
• Landscaping  
• Free-standing structures including adjacent buildings, berms,  
walls and other structures  
• Pergolas, porches, verandas and colonnades  
• Structural elements  
• Non-structural elements of the building envelope.  
# 4.3 Shading to windows  
Passive shading elements in the vicinity of the window include  
light shelves, screens, overhangs and fins. Screens \(*brise soleil*\)  
include *jali*, *mashrabiỹa*, metal grillages, assemblies of concrete  
‘egg-crate’ and other perforated blocks. Additional active elements  
include adjustable fins, louvres and awnings, and mechanical  
variants of these, some of which may be automated by thermal  
response. External louvres and shutters will be more effective  
than internal ones. Metal shutters will become very hot and radiate  
heat into the building. Screens may incorporate fly-screening. Any  
screening device may block part of the view, trap air and suffer  
mechanical damage.  
Light shelves are horizontal slabs that penetrate the window,  
usually about a third of the way down from the top, well above  
eye level. The white painted top reflects light into the room and  
onto the ceiling via the upper element of the window. The body  
of the light shelf shades the interior and the lower element of  
the window. A combination of the light shelf and vertical fins  
will provide protection from lateral as well as overhead angles,  
but both will trap hot air unless partially slatted to allow air  
movement.  
*Brise soleil* can create a striking design which may also serve  
as a security screen, but keep horizontal elements away from  
eye level in habitable rooms, as they can be visually disturbing.  
Metal screens suspended up to a metre away from the window  
can be visually striking and functionally effective. They may  
also have the effect of acting as a ‘rain-screen’. Another option  
is the use of tensioned wire ‘rigging’ suspended over façades to  
provide a support for climbing plants. Plants may grow up from  
the ground or down from high-level irrigated containers. They  
will provide an attractive dappled shade but will need mainte-  
nance and may harbour vermin.  
# 4.4 Porches, pergolas, trellises, balconies, verandas  
# and colonnades  
Any shaded or covered space around the edges of buildings or  
around internal courtyards will act as a transitional space which,  
depending on its particular function, can be seen as an extension  
of habitable space or as a barrier or a bridge between public and  
private space. In all cases, this shaded space will moderate tem-  
perature, keeping the sun off the main structure and maintaining  
a more consistent temperature in the interior. Climbing plants  
add evaporative cooling. Trees may shade the roof, driveways,  
patios – the larger the better. Transpiration is evaporative cooling. All trees with foliage at high level permit low air movement. If  
air conditioners and other electrical equipment in this space are  
shaded, it improves their performance. The interior beyond this  
shaded space will be glare-free and relatively dark, except when  
low winter sun penetrates to the inner walls, but this darkness is  
psychologically cooling and pleasant, provided that it does not  
necessitate the use of artificial light during the day. The gloom  
can be alleviated by borrowed light, hooded clerestory windows,  
or light scoops.  
The effectiveness of these shade-giving spaces will depend on  
orientation, latitude, depth, prevailing breezes and width/height  
ratio. In all hot climates, verandas or shaded patios may become  
the main living spaces for most of the year, and any building design  
should recognise the social and environmental importance of these  
spaces. Except in balconies to individual bedrooms, the covered  
space should have sufficient depth to allow a group of people to  
sit around a small table \(private houses\) or to allow people to work  
or promenade in comfort \(public colonnades\). The depth of shade  
should be sufficient to enable the anticipated activity to be carried  
out in comfort.  
The iconic colonial bungalow has a veranda on all four ele-  
vations, with each one being used at different times of the day  
or year. In all climates with a marked seasonal variation in tem-  
perature, the main shaded veranda should be placed so that when  
the sun is overhead in the hot season, it barely penetrates into the  
space, but in the cold season, when the sun is lower, it shines into  
the recess, providing warmth. Verandas facing east or west will  
not keep out the unwanted heat of the rising or setting sun during  
the hot season.  
In hot humid climates, conditions may be too unpleasant  
indoors during both the day and the night. In the humid evening  
and night, flying insects are a particular nuisance, and one or more  
of the verandas should be fly-screened. This cuts down air move-  
ment but is essential. In two-storey houses, a secure screened  
upper veranda may be used for sleeping on the hottest nights. In  
humid climates, it is common practice to raise the house, sleep-  
ing areas and verandas as high as possible above the ground, to  
catch the night breezes. On cooler days, the dappled shade under  
a pergola supporting a vine or other climbing plant may be more  
pleasant than deep shade. A further strategy is to use a double flat  
roof. If there is clear space between the upper and lower elements,  
the lower roof will not suffer from the severe heat gain that a sin-  
gle roof would emit into the spaces below it. Security will be a  
consideration in the design of most verandas and external spaces  
used for sleeping.  
# 4.5 Courtyards, patios and atria  
Courtyards or patios are traditional features in most hot climates  
and serve several purposes\:  
• Defending the occupants from the busy, noisy, smelly street  
• Ensuring privacy  
• Providing security and control, e.g. of children  
• Reducing built depth and, potentially, increase through-  
ventilation, Table IX.  
Courtyards may be lined with verandas or colonnades \(as was  
the monastic cloister\). The surrounding walls and roof will cast  
shade into the courtyard from the east in the early morning and  
from the west in the early evening. The courtyard itself may be  
shaded by tall trees, awnings or retractable canopies. At night, cool  
night air sinks into the centre of the courtyard, whilst warmer air  
trapped in the courtyard rises around the perimeter, warming the  
rooms alongside. Tall trees with canopies above the yard will give  
effective shading whilst allowing air movement; trees with their  
canopy below the courtyard roofline may trap air and fumes from  
appliances. Trees and retractable awnings can improve the perfor-  
mance of the courtyard.

weather protection, decorative effect or many gains  
additional privacy  
*Aspect ratio of courtyards*  
The aspect ratio of courtyards is critical to their effectiveness. In the  
low aspect ratio courtyard \(H/W \< 0.3\), access to external air is good,  
but there is little recirculation; in the medium aspect ratio courtyard  
\(H/W 0.3–1\), recirculation becomes important. Heat dissipation is  
better than in the low aspect ratio courtyard. In the high aspect ratio  
courtyard \(H/W \> 1\), unless the courtyard acts as a solar flue, there  
will be turbulence at the top, but no air movement at the bottom.  
*Atria*  
An atrium \(inner courtyard with a glazed roof\) may overheat in  
hot climates unless carefully designed. It will provide an attractive  
large space within a building that acts as a focal point and, like  
any lightwell, it will admit and reflect light into spaces that would  
otherwise have been dark. The fall-off in lighting levels will be  
quite rapid at lower levels, as the ‘no-sky line’ is passed – the point  
at which the occupant is unable to see the sky. At this point, inter-  
nal light levels drop off sharply. An atrium has the potential to act  
as a solar flue if adequately ventilated \(naturally or mechanically\),  
drawing stale air out of the surrounding spaces. In climates with  
regular rainfall, atria can provide considerable amenity as meeting,  
eating and sheltering spaces. In taller buildings, their height means  
that landscaping can include tall trees. Glare and brightness can  
be reduced by using blinds below the glazing, or temporary tented  
canopies above it. Atria design, however, must take account of fire  
risk, as the space can also act as a flue for flames, heat and smoke.  
# 4.6 Options at or within the window to protect from  
# direct sunlight  
It is preferable to have blinds and shutter on the exterior of the  
window, rather than the interior. External blinds and shutters can  
keep interiors cool and robust shutters can protect against storm  
damage and provide security. Internal Venetian or roller blinds, or  
curtains \(sheer or heavy drapes\) should have a pale lining facing  
out to reflect heat back out of the window, fit tightly to prevent heat  
dispersing into the room, cover the whole window, and, for maxi-  
mum effect, be made in an insulating material. Sheers will reduce  
glare, but will not significantly reduce solar gain.  
*Special glass*  
A wide range of solar control glass is available, in grey, gold,  
green, blue and pink tints, usually applied as the filling in a lami-  
nated sandwich. Outlook will be affected by the colour of the tint  
and degree of light reduction. **40-12 Tropical design**  
*Special films applied to the glass*  
Plastic films containing gold and other minerals can be applied  
to achieve a wide range of effects. They are comparatively inex-  
pensive, typically affording payback within 4 years, and affect the  
outlook from the building.  
# 4.7 Modification of light transmission, brightness  
# and glare  
Planting, colour \(outside and in window frame and reveal\) light  
baffles, light absorbing or deflecting glass or glass block, and  
screen walling can also lower light transmission and glare. Pools  
of water close to the building will reflect light and add evaporative  
cooling. Bright external surfaces of adjoining buildings or screen  
walls will reflect light but should not add glare. Reflecting surface  
should preferably not be painted white. To reduce glare, take the  
‘bite’ out of white by adding a touch of a dark colour. Reflectors  
in the form of horizontal or vertical panels and mirrors can also  
brighten spaces.  
*Light scoops and reflectors*  
Light scoops are a form of rooflight that bring light into the interior  
of buildings. In temperate climates, especially those with overcast  
skies, the glazed surface may be angled for maximum light gain  
whilst facing away from direct sun. In the tropics, they are usually  
vertical and shaded to prevent any incidence of direct sunlight. On  
a smaller scale, sunpipes or lightpipes are highly polished metal  
tubes that reflect light gathered via a Perspex dome at roof level  
and discharged via a similar inverted dome diffuser into a dark inte-  
rior space. They are economical, efficient and effective. Both light  
scoops and lightpipes may also incorporate ventilation.  
# 4.8 Wind towers, wind scoops and wind catchers  
Wind towers are air extract or inlet flues, used to ventilate and  
cool buildings. The origin of these towers is in the arid tropical  
climate of the Middle East, where they are used to ventilate and  
cool the lowest floors of town houses. Houses in these climates are  
enclosed, with few external openings, to keep out sand and dust  
as well as to minimise solar gain. They have a high thermal mass,  
which maintains some warmth in the cold winters.  
The prevailing breeze is caught and funnelled down into the  
base of the house through a duct or flue in a party wall. This flue  
does not receive any solar radiation, so it remains cooler than the  
rest of the house during the day. Incoming air is cooled by con-  
duction during its contact with the cool walls of the flue and RH is  
increased when it passes over porous water jugs.  
In Iraq, the cool breeze is discharged into a basement, used for  
the afternoon siesta. During the hottest months, the roof terrace is  
used for sleeping at night. The top of the wind catcher is capped  
to keep rain out, and usually can be closed in winter, when it will  
have the reverse benefit of keeping the house warmer. Screens keep  
birds and insects out of the flue.  
*Urban wind towers*  
Air at street level in cities can be laden with toxic particulate mat-  
ter and noxious gases. Air drawn from this environment will be  
polluted and will also introduce noise pollution. If we wish to  
use natural ventilation in city buildings, the cleanest air will be  
obtained from high level.  
In cities, the maze of streets, differing heights of buildings,  
levels of pollution, vortices, pressure differentials, etc. create local  
air movement patterns. Fixed wind catchers can be ineffective in  
these situations, and scoops that can rotate with the wind become  
essential. Air inlets serving the flues may be windows, open court-  
yards, grilles, under-floor ducts \(which can pre-cool the air\) or  
wind scoops.  
The use of wind towers reduces reliance on mechanical venti-  
lation, chilling and air conditioning. Aerofoils may also be used  
to accelerate air movement and thereby improve ventilation. Used  
in conjunction with narrowing spaces, aerofoils act like aeroplane  
wings, creating pressure differentials that will draw air out of  
buildings.  
*Solar flues*  
Solar flues are wind towers where air movement is accelerated by  
heating the air in the tower or flue by intensifying solar radiation on  
the external wall of the vertical duct acting as the flue.  
# 4.9 Trombe walls  
The trombe wall is a thick dense wall within a building that  
receives and stores solar radiation \(usually through the intensifying  
medium of glass\) during daylight hours, and then radiates the heat  
into internal spaces during the evening. The wall is designed \(mate-  
rial, thickness, location\) to provide the desired time lag to provide  
the heat when it is most needed. It is particularly effective in desert  
climates with a high diurnal temperature range.  
# 4.10 Site layout and landscaping  
Orientation \(and design to suit that orientation\) is paramount, even  
if this conflicts with the normal good advice to follow the con-  
tour and keep substructure costs down. Building across the contour  
provides an opportunity to use a split-level plan, with associated  
discontinuities in the roofline to admit light and allow air move-  
ment.  
The use of any hard or soft landscaping implies a commitment  
to irrigate, maintain, restock and clear leaf litter and rubbish from  
these areas, and to employ staff to carry out these tasks. If sites such  
as roundabouts and the central strip of dual carriageways are to be  
landscaped, these will need a water supply, unless the landscaping  
is intended to be long-term and self-sufficient.  
In some countries, landscaping is highly valued, state-supported  
and recognised as providing valuable employment. In others, it is  
politically frowned upon, being seen as diverting funding from  
schools, hospital and other socially important programmes. In  
either scenario, there may be a thriving agricultural industry that  
may include the cultivation of exotic species for exporting to dis-  
tant world markets.  
*Soft landscaping*  
Trees and lush landscaping, together with lakes, fountains, pools  
and other open bodies of water, are visually attractive and will  
induce cooling. Strategic planting of trees and shrubs can shade  
buildings and lower temperature, reducing energy costs in mechan-  
ical cooling by up to 40 per cent. This is achieved directly, by  
shading, and indirectly, through evaporative cooling induced by  
transpiration.  
Plants grow quickly in the tropics and schemes can be estab-  
lished very quickly, but may require the establishment of on-site  
nurseries. Nurseries consume a lot of water and will require the  
construction of shade houses. These are simple structures in the  
plant nursery, usually roofed and walled with an open-woven split  
bamboo mat. Many tropical plants used in landscaping are forest  
species accustomed to lower levels of light\: using this slatted baf-  
fle allows a continual hit-miss pattern of daylight to pass over the  
plant as the sun moves across the sky, ensuring that the plants get  
adequate light on all sides, whilst being tricked into accelerating  
growth by the on-off daylight.  
Shade trees, whether used for shading people or vehicles,  
should use species that give good dappled or deeper shade, have a  
root system that stays below paved surfaces, and that do not drop  
leaves, flowers, pods or fruit that will cause nuisance or damage.  
Soft landscaping that uses or integrates indigenous species will  
help to contextualise planting schemes and encourage use by birds  
and other wildlife.  
An indicative list of tree and shrub species used in landscap-  
ing schemes is given in Table X. Unless listed as drought-resistant,  
most species will require irrigation in climates with a marked dry season. Table X describes plant type, habitat criteria and continent  
of origin.  
*Hard landscaping*  
Hard landscaping strategies should take advantage of local mate-  
rials and resources \(such as local stone and specialised schools  
of carving and sculpting\) and provide facilities for local cultural  
practices and acceptable activities \(such as pavement cafes, street  
theatre, public exercise sessions, street traders and curio sellers\).  
Public and company space may be required for sports \(basketball,  
bowling, chess, football, etc\). Some of these may need to be shaded.  
Sitting areas may need to be in the shade, rather than the sun, and  
drinking fountains may be required. Many activities, including pro-  
duce markets, can be accommodated under shade structures, which  
lend themselves to simple but dramatic structural forms, such as  
shells or tents.  
# 4.11 Urban centres and street layouts  
All large urban areas are hotter than the surrounding rural areas\:  
people, industry, machines, vehicles, buildings all generate heat,  
pollution and gases including CO2. In hot climates, it is particularly  
important to incorporate heat sinks \(lakes, parks, woodland\) that  
can lower air and ground temperature.  
*Urban streets*  
Narrow streets are cooler than wide boulevards, unless these are  
planted with large street trees. On streets running north – south, the  
higher the height to width ratio \(H/W ratio\), the less time the sun  
has on the street surface and on façades facing the street. The street  
will be cool in the morning and evening.  
On streets running east–west, latitude becomes more important  
than H/W ratio. On or near the equator, the sun will be overhead or  
rising and setting on the street alignment. As distance from the equa-  
tor increases, there is greater likelihood that in the hot season most  
of the street surface and the elevation facing the equator will receive  
solar radiation all day, whilst in the cold season, narrower streets  
and one elevation may be in shade all day, with the elevation facing  
the equator only receiving significant solar radiation when the sun is  
above the roof level of the buildings on the other side of the street.  
*Vehicles*  
Vehicles parked in open sunlight will become unbearably hot and  
petrol will evaporate. Car parking that is not inside or under build-  
ings should be shaded by free-standing canopies, shade trees or  
pergolas. Parking areas and street layouts may need to take account  
of specialised vehicles \(bicycle-rickshaws, horse-drawn cabs, artic-  
ulated buses\) and differing ratios of pedestrians, public transport,  
car ownership or bicycle use in cities.  
# 5 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL STRATEGIES\:  
# ACTIVE MEASURES  
# 5.1 Adjustable shading and ventilation  
Active shading may be provided by\:  
• Manually controlled awnings and blinds  
• Automatically controlled awnings and blinds  
• Shutters – which may be removable  
• Independent and temporary canopies  
• Retractable roofs.  
Increasingly, shading and venting systems are controlled by  
sensors that respond to light levels, temperature, the onset of pre-  
cipitation or wind velocities. As with passive options, these are  
most effective when placed externally, but sensitive mechanisms  
may need to be internal. Large retractable roofs are now commonly  
used over sports stadia.  
# Tropical design 40-13  
# 5.2 Photovoltaics  
Grid-connected BIPV \(building-integrated photovoltaics\) are flat solar  
cells fixed to parts of the building envelope in an array that faces into  
the sun. They generate direct current \(DC\) which must be converted  
into alternating current and, although expensive and offering poor effi-  
ciency at present, can bring cost savings by downloading power to the  
national grid during the day, thereby reducing the cost of upload from  
the grid at night. These savings depend on an equitable arrangement  
with the generating company, and on associated passive measures that  
use the building envelope efficiently. All photovoltaic cells use sili-  
con, in various forms, and are either black or blue in appearance. The  
electrified arrays are dangerous, and must be installed, maintained and  
supervised by electricians with specialist expertise.  
Photovoltaic slates appear no different to regular natural slates  
and are claimed to achieve savings of up to 25 per cent on domestic  
energy consumption.  
# 5.3 Wind turbines  
If these are attached to buildings, the design must accommodate  
the swing of the turbine blades and the additional structural loading  
from vibration. Risk of damage and injury from broken blades must  
be assessed. Turbines may be horizontal or vertical axis and avail-  
able in a wide variety of designs. They vary hugely in size from  
500 mm to 50 m or more in diameter. Siting is critical and noise,  
atmospheric disturbance and bird-kill events affect acceptability.  
# 5.4 Ventilation and air conditioning  
The need for mechanical aids and the costs in running and maintaining  
them will be reduced by passive design strategies that offer improved  
ventilation, shading and temperature management. Wherever pos-  
sible, design out the need for mechanical solutions. Designers are  
increasingly using wind towers and solar flues to drive ventilation.  
*Ceiling fans*  
Allow adequate headroom below the blades of the fan. Ceiling fans  
give a wide distribution of blown air. Since the diameter of the fan  
is large, the fan can have a relatively low speed, reducing noise.  
*Typical installation*  
Ceiling height 3.0 m minimum  
Minimum blade height above floor 2.5 m  
Fan diameter 1.0 m  
*Wall and floor-mounted fans*  
Because the blades are set within a cage, these can give higher air speeds  
and a more concentrated air stream. They may be fixed or can oscillate.  
*Typical data*  
Mounting height 1.5–2.0 m  
Angle of oscillation up to 60°  
‘Reach’ of blown air 3–4 m  
*Roof extract fans and passive stack vent*  
With light roof constructions, extract fans are used to remove hot air  
from the ceiling void and internal rooms. Internal air temperatures  
may be reduced by 3–5°C in climates where high solar radiation is  
combined with moderate air temperatures. The extract fan does not  
give perceptible air movement within the building.  
*Unit air conditioners*  
Room air conditioners are available with a cooling capacity in the  
range from 1.5 to 7 kW \(Btus/h are commonly used to measure  
capacity as many manufacturers and designs originate in the USA\).  
Specifications vary considerably and may include heaters and fan-  
only options, as well as chillers. They are usually accommodated  
in walls or under windows \(often as afterthoughts\). Unit air con-  
ditioners require external air for removing excess heat, a fresh air  
inlet and drainage for water removed from the air during cooling. **40-14 Tropical design**

Double roof • This structure places an open  
including ventilated space between the  
aerofoil roof weather protection of the upper  
roof and the shaded element  
of the inner and lower roof,  
which may serve as a sleeping  
platform in hot weather  
• The aerofoil uses two converging  
and aerodynamically designed  
profiles to accelerate air  
movement over the roof  
• Can trap heat if not vented • Large overhangs in wet tropics  
• Voids can harbour vermin and conceal • Roof pitch, valleys, etc. must cope with intense  
defects and deterioration rainfall  
• Difficult to weatherproof against rainstorms • Security is increasingly an issue  
• Climate change may cause unpredictable  
weather  
• May be vulnerable to storm damage in  
severe weather  
• There may be loss of security or privacy  
• Extra height

• Aerofoil may need extensive modelling and  
testing to prove  
\* The lag or delay in temperature change in materials with a high thermal mass, retaining warmth at night and coolness in the morning  
*Split air conditioning units*  
Split air conditioning units have the following advantages over unit  
\(or ‘room’\) air conditioners\:  
• Minimal structural alterations if installed in an existing building  
or minimal requirements for new buildings\: the two pipes con-  
necting the condenser to the air handler will fit through a 100  
mm hole  
• Greater security \(important for banks, shops, etc.\)  
• Reduced noise within the room, due to external position of con-  
denser  
• Greater flexibility internally as air handler may be placed on  
internal wall or even ceiling  
• Improved external appearance as condenser may be placed on  
the roof, reducing problems of dripping condensate.  
The disadvantages are\:  
• Unsightly and noisy condenser unit. This may annoy the neigh-  
bours, rather than the room occupant  
• Space needs to be found for it.  
# 6 STRUCTURE, SERVICES AND ENVIRONMEN-  
# TAL DESIGN  
# 6.1 Structural design  
The structural form must be a viable economic choice and must  
facilitate the appropriate design response to climate. Hot arid cli-  
mates suit dense masonry construction; hot humid climates suit a  
lightweight frame with a low mass ventilated interior structure.  
Composite climates require a mix – perhaps solid heat-storing  
floors with a lighter superstructure and adjustable shading. All  
structures must be able to withstand predicted climatic extremes  
that affect stability and structural integrity. There is less need for  
enclosure in all but the arid tropics and many structures will consist  
of a dramatic roof on exposed supports, with few permanent walls.  
For notes on site soils and geotechnics, see Section 2.6.  
*Concrete*  
Concrete is widely used in the tropics, where steel and other imported  
materials may be costly. Low-labour costs may have permitted  
the adventurous use of the plastic properties of concrete, in hypar  
\(hyperbaric parabola\), shell and other one-off forms \(see Chapter 6,  
Structure\). Use of concrete will depend on availability of cement, **40-18 Tropical design**  
adequate water supplies and suitable materials for formwork.  
Suitable formwork may be difficult to obtain. Taller buildings will  
need pumping capabilities. Hot climates may necessitate chilling of  
concrete \(ice in tankers\), the use of retarding agents, and the shading  
and repeated wetting of poured concrete during the curing stage.  
*Steel*  
Transportation costs may make steel structures uneconomic. Humid  
environments may necessitate special protective treatments. Steel  
doorframes and windows may be used in preference to timber, to  
reduce termite damage.  
*Timber*  
Timber should be from sustainable forests and must withstand ter-  
mites, heat, desiccation or humidity, where applicable. Levels of  
drying shrinkage and warping may be unacceptable. Seasoning may  
be required before timber can be used. The performance capabilities  
of each particular species must be known, especially for structural  
timbers. If large sections of structural timber are not available, glu-  
lam may be good alternatives \(glulam – thin strips of timber built  
up in laminations to produce an attractive, consistent material with  
excellent structural properties\). In some areas, profligate consump-  
tion of forest timber, in construction and as fuelwood, has left some  
forest species critically depleted. Converted timber, as plywood and  
other board products, may be available to locally established speci-  
fications. Structural design issues are highlighted in Table XI.  
# 6.2 Design in earthquake zones  
Earthquakes may occur anywhere on the globe, but are more common  
in the hotter regions. In earthquake zones, it is generally accepted that  
choosing the right type of structure is more important than minor varia-  
tions in detail. Failures occur due to inelasticity – and these failures are  
difficult to model, especially in complex structures. Always work with  
a structural engineer. Always consider the risk of collateral damage  
from and to the surrounding land, landscaping and buildings. Modest  
earthquakes may trigger flood, landslides and thermoplastic flow.  
When designing buildings in earthquake zones, the following  
points should be noted\:  
*USE*  
• Simple, compact structural forms with continuous lines of struc-  
tural force and inbuilt redundancies  
• Compact, symmetrical plans with maximum resistance to tor-  
sional stresses  
• Symmetry in loading, fenestration, stair placement, cladding pat-  
terns and infilling.  
*AVOID*  
• Complex forms with irregular and diverted lines of structural  
force – H, L, T, U, X and E plan forms are particularly vulnera-  
ble, as vibration may differ along each axis  
• Discontinuities in form, mass, storey height, materials, setbacks,  
overhangs, or in infilling, which may create a ‘soft storey’ at any  
level and precipitate failure  
• Breaks in columns and shear walls – failure to continue upper  
floor columns and shear walls through the ground floor \(creating a  
‘soft storey’\) have contributed to loss of structural integrity or seri-  
ous progressive collapses in earthquakes \(and terrorist bombings\)  
• Windows within 600 mm of external corners.  
*Structural detail*  
• Engineers may adopt a weak beam/strong column philosophy to  
allow beams to flex more than columns  
• Corner columns are more at risk\: elevations may act as plates  
and twist corners. Similarly, windows that dress around corners  
are particularly vulnerable  
• Continuity, linking and placement of reinforcement can be crucial  
• Floor slab-to-column connections must resist punching shear  
• Continuous bottom reinforcement through slabs and beams will  
act as catenaries and resist collapse  
• Partial restraint of columns by partial height infilling can expose  
the remaining unrestrained section of the column to excessive  
shear at the expense of flexural yield, leading to failure.  
*Damage and injury*  
• Some earthquake damage to the fabric will appear and must be  
accepted, but loss of structural integrity or collapse of inhabited  
buildings is never acceptable  
• All significant structural and non-structural elements \(cladding, par-  
apets, staircases, etc.\) must be securely tied to the structural system  
• Protect escape routes and mustering points from falling glass or  
cladding.  
*Non-structural elements*  
• Structural damage, gas explosions and fire can be caused by  
movement and failure of non-structural elements  
• Incoming gas services should have automatic safety shut off valves  
• Performance of structural elements can be compromised or  
altered by the action of non-structural elements  
• Injury and death can be caused by falling non-structural elements  
• Cost of repair of non-structural elements can render a building unviable  
• All large appliances, cylinders and tall furniture should be bolted  
or strapped in place and loose items that could fall and cause  
injury should be stored at low level.  
*Concrete structures*  
• Concrete fill and landscaping soil on top of concrete slabs have  
no cohesion, no benefit and may cause excessive loads which  
contribute to collapse  
• Concrete structures shaken by successive earthquakes may suf-  
fer unseen and incur cumulatively worsening damage.  
*Steel framed structures*  
Assumptions that welded steel frames will have sufficient ductility  
to perform well during tremors has not been borne out by events  
in Kobe in Japan and in California. Beam-to-column connections  
have cracked due to construction, material and bonding failures.  
Standards and codes have been revised in these areas.  
*Timber-framed buildings*  
It is essential to create rigidity by using shear walls \(studs stiffened  
by rigid ply panels\) and to maintain continuity through the structure.  
Cripple walls, especially as above-ground substructure, form a ‘soft sto-  
rey’ and are a regular point of failure. Braced timber-framed structures  
are likely to fail at their weakest point – usually where they are unbraced  
in their supporting storey of extended timber piles. Structures built on  
top of piers must be securely restrained. Masonry chimneys set into  
timber-framed buildings may collapse and upper floors with structural  
panels in the floor around the chimney will reduce the risk of injury.  
# 6.3 Power  
Mains power supply may be unreliable or only available in larger urban  
areas. However, many tropical countries have modern reliable utilities.  
Standards for voltage vary. The design of the distribution system is as  
for temperate climates except that high soil temperatures may lead to a  
requirement for cable sizes to be larger to avoid overheating, and cable  
might need protection against termites and other hungry fauna.  
# 6.4 Alternative energy  
Energy supplies may be unreliable or non-existent on remote sites.  
Power may need to be supplied by a diesel generator, or some other  
means that capitalises on latent potential in or near the site, such as\:  
• *Biomass* – using crop and forestry wastes, slurries and rapid  
cropping trees, and herbaceous plants, which are dried, prepared  
and burnt, usually in combination with gas, to produce energy. • *Geothermal* – naturally occurring subterranean hot water and gas.  
• *Biodiesel and biofuels* – ethanol may be a by-product of the  
agro-industry \(as in the conversion of sugar cane to granular  
sugar or cane spirit\).  
• *Solar power* – photovoltaics, water heating.  
• *Water* – micro-hydro, run-of-river, estuarine and tidal mini turbines.  
• *Wind* – free-standing wind pumps or building-integrated turbines.  
# 6.5 Solar heating  
At its simplest, a solar heater is a coil of hosepipe drawing water  
from the mains water supply, which is set into a flat framed box  
set at an angle, usually on a roof, which will enable it to absorb the  
maximum amount of sunlight. In the box, the hosepipe is laid on a  
reflective surface and covered with a sheet of heat-absorbing glass,  
both of which are designed to heat up the water in the hosepipe  
as quickly as possible. The heated water is drawn off as needed  
using separate taps, or is stored once a predetermined temperature  
is reached. These water heaters are simple and effective, but do not  
raise water temperature significantly on cold or heavily overcast  
days, when hot water is most needed. They also need maintaining,  
as the hose is subjected to extreme heat and has a relatively short  
life. Ready-made solar heaters use more sophisticated materials.  
# 6.6 Water supply  
The WHO and the World Bank supply extensive data on recommended  
standards for water supply. Table XII has been superseded by a plethora  
of targets for individual countries, but serves as a starting point. In some  
countries, brackish water for irrigation is supplied by an independent  
system to conserve drinking water. Table XIII shows the large amounts  
of water required to maintain lawns and Western style gardens.  
Where water supplies are erratic, scarce or costly, measures that  
more efficiently collect, store, use and recycle water are needed.  
These include using low-flush or dry toilets, showers in lieu of baths  
and the use of ‘grey water’. Grey water is water that has already been  
used, in domestic washing, in chilling plant or in industry, and it is  
used to flush toilets and for uses other than drinking and cooking.  
Design of a rainwater collection and storage system may be part  
of the building designer or services engineer’s task. Water may be  
collected off expanses of sloping smooth surfaces, in seepage dams  
or in open tanks. Bacteria multiply at an astonishing rate in open  
water exposed to the sun.  
# 6.7 Sanitary installations and waste disposal  
*Sanitary appliances*  
Customary and religious practices vary. Some societies prefer the  
more ergonomically correct squat pan to the Western WC. Muslims  
wash in running water, so prefer the shower to the bath, and wash hand  
basins should have a mixer rather than separate hot and cold taps.

# Tropical design 40-19  
*Foul sewerage*  
The capacity of piped systems will be related to the water supply  
standard. Where sewers are laid with low falls and where high soil  
temperatures exist, sewage may become septic and attack asbestos  
cement and cement pipes. Sewage disposal may be by pit latrine,  
aqua privy or septic tank in low-density development. Pit latrines  
require adequate space for replacements after the average life of  
5 years, although this depends on soil conditions, etc. They should  
be stack vented. European toilets and septic tanks sized in accord-  
ance with Western data will not be able to cope with the bulky  
stools produced by a high-bulk cereal diet based on maize and sim-  
ilar cereals. Standard design data for septic tanks will be available.  
The length of tail drains depends on the soil type.  
# 6.8 Storm and surface water drainage  
Design rainfall intensities may not have been measured, making it  
difficult to calculate the size of gutters, but indicative data could be  
collected on site. Tropical storms can have brief periods with rain-  
fall intensities of 100 mm/h. Frequently, very heavy rain follows a  
long dry period during which drainage channels become blocked  
with sand and soil. In these zones, open or openable monsoon or  
storm drains are used to provide adequate capacity and ease of  
cleansing. Where piped systems are employed, large sand traps are  
needed at each gully, and a minimum pipe size of 150 mm is nec-  
essary \(200 mm is sometimes mandatory\). Gradients should give a  
minimum self-cleansing velocity of 1 m/s. Roof gutters may not be  
provided at the eaves where torrential rains are experienced, as they  
cannot cope with the volume of water. Water discharges straight  
off the roof into open dish drains, or onto a wide concrete apron  
with a fall away from the building to prevent any splash back onto  
walls which may be single skin. Porches that redirect the water are  
needed at entrances.  
Mosquitoes can breed in shallow water lying in gutters with low  
falls. On larger building where gutters are provided, these may be  
in the form of heavy and costly concrete features, but large sec-  
tion gutters are now available in a range of materials, including  
aluminium and steel. Large gutters in glass reinforced plastic or  
other more flexible materials would need to be tested for strength  
to withstand the full water load if not fully supported.  
# 6.9 Controlling mosquitoes and other flying insects  
Mosquitoes \(and other insects, including moths\) are attracted to  
bright lights, still air and water. Geckoes and chameleons eat them.  
The normal means of deterring mosquitoes have been to\:  
• Prevent insects from entering buildings at all times  
• Attract insects away from buildings  
• Protect the body at night, especially early evening – when mos-  
quitoes are most prevalent  
• Take measures to kill any insects that have entered buildings  
• Increase air movement in and around buildings \(mosquitoes like  
still air\)  
• Eliminate breeding sites around buildings  
• Undertake mass spraying programmes over larger areas.  
Design solutions include\:  
• Fly-screening all windows and open doorways  
• Using mosquito nets over beds  
• Increasing air movement using fans, stack venting and wind fun-  
nelling devices  
• Avoiding bright lights, especially in open sitting or dining areas  
• Using exterior lighting to draw them away from occupied buildings  
• Using electronic devices that use bright light or smell to attract  
and kill insects  
• Eliminating all existing or potential areas of standing water  
where mosquitoes breed, which will include cutting back under-  
growth and controlling landscaping. **40-20 Tropical design**  
Mosquito nets are essential, but they restrict ventilation. The net  
may be suspended from a timber or metal frame, like a lightweight  
four-poster, or from the ceiling on a frame or circular ring \(a hos-  
pital net\). The net should be long enough to tuck securely around  
and under the mattress.  
The use of sprayed insecticides within buildings at night has  
traditionally included organophosphates and other cumulative poi-  
sons. Long-term use of these substances is harmful. All chemicals  
need to be treated with caution. In the tropics, spraying on either  
a domestic or mass scale may still be carried out using chemicals  
such as DDT, which are banned in the developed world.  
Elimination of standing water is very important and extends  
beyond the careful design of open gutters and drains to ensure that  
the fall is sufficient to take water away from inhabited areas. Some  
local authorities will have strictly enforced byelaws banning the  
planting of maize and other plants where the leaf forms a sheath  
around the stem, trapping water. Water used in landscaping should  
be agitated by fountains or the recycling mechanism and not be  
allowed to become stagnant. Swimming pools and their overspill  
areas will need appropriate treatment suited to tropical conditions.  
Other breeding sites can include sedimentation ponds on sewage  
farms, agriculturally dammed fields \(paddy fields\) and the large  
lagoons that linger in low-lying areas after heavy rains or coastal  
storms.  
# 7 BUILDING SCIENCE DATA  
# 7.1 Sun path diagrams  
The use of sun path diagrams and shadow angle protractors is fully  
detailed in the texts listed in the Bibliography. When the sun path  
diagrams for the northern hemisphere are used for the southern  
hemisphere, changes should be made to the time, month, azimuth,  
direction, as shown in Table XIV. Shading coefficients are given in  
Table XV. Online sun path calculation tools are available.  
# 7.2 Albedo \(also known as solar reflectance or ground  
# reflectance\)  
Albedo is the percentage of solar radiation reflected from a surface,  
compared to the incoming \(incident\) solar radiation that the surface  
receives. The term signifies ‘whiteness’ and therefore reflectance  
within the visible spectrum, but is usually taken to mean total  
short-wave energy. Albedo varies according to the colour, seasonal  
variations in ground cover \(snow, deciduous trees, crops\) and, to a  
lesser extent, humidity of the surface covering. To avoid overheat-  
ing, surfaces exposed to solar radiation will have low absorptivities  
and high emissivities \(high albedo\) and, to accumulate heat gains  
and act as heat stores, will have high absorptivities and low emis-  
sivities \(low albedo\). See *Albedos* \(Frank V. Hansen, 1993\) for  
indicative albedos for a range of surfaces.

For all materials\:  
Reflectivity = 1 − absorptivity \(for radiation of a given wavelength\)  
Absorptivity = emissivity \(for radiation of a given wavelength\)  
Pale surfaces reflect the greatest percentage of incident radiation,  
thereby reflecting the associated heat away from the surfaces of  
the building or paving. This may make glare and heat gain worse  
in the adjacent building. The impact of albedo on the heat island  
effect in cities is an area of current research in many centres. Trees  
with a low albedo will lower temperature through different mech-  
anisms – including metabolism and transpiration; bright surfaces  
reduce temperature by reflection. In the city, surfaces tend to be  
dark and with a low albedo \(brick, asphalt, slate\) so they absorb  
and store heat that cannot easily be radiated back into the sky due  
to the canyon effect of city streets. These raised temperatures accel-  
erate decay of the urban fabric, exacerbate pollution and worsen  
ozone concentration. Smog in the atmosphere above cities traps  
the hot air beneath it. It would appear that tree-planting in cities  
has greater benefits than high albedo of surfaces, especially as we  
know that raising albedo outside the city, by stripping tree cover  
and replacing it with cultivation, has the effect of lowering rainfall  
and increasing the risk of drought.  
# 7.3 Sol air temperature  
Sol air temperature is the temperature of the outside air that would  
give the same rate of heat transfer and the same distribution of tem-  
perature through a construction as the combined effects of solar  
radiation and air temperature. Sol air temperature will be higher  
than air temperature when a surface is subject to solar radiation\:  
Where *θ*sa = sol air temperature \(°C\)  
*α* = absorptivity of surface to solar radiation  
*f*o = outside surface conductance \(W/m2K\)  
*I* = intensity of solar radiation \(W/m2\)  
*θ*o = outside air temperature \(°C\).  
The solar heat factor is the heat flow through the construction  
due to solar radiation, expressed as a proportion of the total solar  
radiation incident on the surface of the construction. When a build-  
ing has large openings and is well ventilated to the exterior \(as is  
often the case in the tropics\), the solar heat factor is dependent on  
the *U-*value and absorptivity the external surface conductance \(‘*f*o’  
can be taken as a constant\)\: Surfaces will be hottest when wind velocities are low; therefore,  
external surface resistances for cold conditions should not be used.  
In hot conditions with low wind speeds, a recommended value for  
*f*o is 20 W/\(m2K\). If the solar heat factor is expressed as a percent-  
age then\:  
*U-*values may be increased if absorptivities are proportionately  
reduced, whilst still maintaining a constant solar heat factor. Most  
reflective surfaces require regular maintenance to remain effec-  
tive, so if maintenance or repainting of surfaces cannot be assured,  
*U-*values should be decreased to obtain realistic standards.  
A solar heat factor of less than 4 per cent will ensure that ceiling  
temperatures will not be more than 5°C above air temperatures and  
will not add to discomfort.  
The approximate absorptivity of solar radiation of paints can be  
calculated if the Munsell value is known \(as it is for colours in the  
British Standard range of paints for building purposes\). The ‘value’  
of the colour is given by the number which appears after the ‘hue’  
letter in the Munsell number. This should be substituted for V in  
the formula\:  
*Absorptivity* = 100−\[V\(V−1\)\] \(for solar radiation\)  
Example\: Munsell number 6.25Y8.5/13 \(Yellow\)  
V= 8.5, Absorptivity = 36% \(at low temperatures most paints  
have an emissivity of 80–90%\).  
# 7.4 Solar radiation  
The intensity of solar radiation on a surface depends on the alti-  
tude of the sun, the orientation of the surface in relation to the sun  
and the absorption of solar radiation by the atmosphere, pollution,  
cloud, etc., Figure 40.2.

*Calculation*\: For vertical surfaces inclined at an angle *θ* to the  
azimuth \(horizontal angle of sun on plan\), the intensity of radia-  
tion on surface *I* will be\:  
*Iv θ* = *Iv* × cos *θ*, where *Iv* is taken from illustration in  
Figure 40.2.  
The altitude and azimuth of the sun can be found from sun path  
diagrams or online calculation tools. The radiation from Figure 40.2  
should be multiplied by the values from Tables XVI and XVII to  
give total radiation at the appropriate altitude and/or for appropriate  
atmospheric conditions.  
# 7.5 Illumination from sun and sky in the tropics  
*Illumination at work surfaces*  
The illumination required at the work surface for a given task is  
the same regardless of latitude. However, since light is associ-  
ated with heat \(both physically and psychologically\), there is a  
case in the tropics for adopting slightly lower lighting standards  
to achieve higher levels of perceived comfort. In some coun-  
tries, the cost of achieving high lighting standards may also be  
a factor.  
The illumination from the sky is greater in tropical and sub-trop-  
ical regions so that a lower daylight factor can be used to achieve  
the same illumination at the work surface. The illumination from an  
overcast sky varies with latitude, altitude, degree of cloudiness and  
pollution. A guide is given in Table XVIII.  
*Position of windows\: overcast skies*  
An overcast sky can be extremely bright and cause unacceptable  
glare from higher angular altitudes above 35°. Windows that offer a  
view below the 35° angle will increase comfort. In the warm humid  
equatorial regions, however, the luminance of the constant overcast  
sky may drop to 10000 lux or below.  
*Position of windows\: clear skies*  
Hot dry desert regions receive light mainly from direct sunlight  
and considerably less from the \(usually\) deep blue sky, so windows  
should allow a view of this high altitude deep blue sky rather than  
along the horizon, which can reflect glare from distant haze and  
the sunlit ground. The window must be protected from direct solar  
radiation, if facing into the sun’s path.  
# Table XVIII Illumination from a design sky

20° 13000 lux  
30° 9000 lux  
40° 6000 lux  
50° 5000 lux  
*Incidence of light*  
Table XIX gives a very rough comparison of the relative amount  
of light from different sources. Figure 40.3 shows the relative sky  
luminance distribution in hot dry desert climates with a clear sky,

# 7.6 Glazing used in solar control  
Traditionally, the best way to reduce solar radiation heat gain was  
to reduce window size \(or provide external shading\). Recent devel-  
opments in glass technology, however, have broadened the range  
of options in the climatic responsiveness of glazing. These alterna-  
tives may reduce energy consumption in space heating or cooling,  
or by permitting the ingress of higher levels of natural daylight  
without excessive heat gain.  
Glazing types now available, under a variety of trade names, are\:  
• *Electrochromic glass* – which, on the touch of a switch, can  
defend the interior from solar heat gain by turning the glass  
opaque or dark.  
• *Thermochromic glass* – which contains an embedded thermostat,  
above which the glass reflects heat, and below that temperature,  
transmits heat.  
• *Photochromic glass* – which, as in a pair of spectacles, dark-  
ens \(or lightens\) incrementally as light intensity increases \(or  
decreases\).  
• *Holographic glass* – which has holographic patterns on the sur-  
face or embedded that, under varying conditions, can reflect  
intense sunlight, or redirect light onto a specific surface.  
• *Transparent insulation* – which allows translucent light but not  
views into a building. It may provide thermal insulation and is avail-  
able in a number of forms including honeycomb, fibre or foam.  
• *Combinations of the above* – which usually result in thickened  
glass and reduced light transmission.  
• *Applied films, independent of the manufacturing process* –  
which, to a lesser extent, can mimic some of the effects achieved  
by special glass.  
Manufacturers have a widely differing range of names for these  
glasses and for their technical performance, and their dedicated lit-  
erature should be consulted for details.  
Solar control glass comes in a wide range of body tints that can  
be a significant part of the design of the building envelope – grey,  
bronze, green, pink, blue, etc. Oxides added to clear glass change  
the colour and vary light and solar radiant heat transmission\: iron  
oxide \(green\), cobalt oxide \(grey and blue\) and selenium oxide  
\(bronze\). Increased thickness darkens the colour and reduces light  
and heat transmission. In solar control glass, a film of microscop-  
ically thin metallic oxides is laid on the surface of a sheet of clear  
or body-tinted glass and is usually protected or sealed within a  
sandwich of two or more layers of glass. Film performance is inde-  
pendent of glass thickness. Coated glasses receive their coating in a  
vacuum chamber; surface modified glasses are produced during the  
float process, using clear glass.  
*Glass blocks*  
Glass blocks are available with different surface finishes that can  
diffuse, reduce or deflect light transmission. The mortar joint  
reduces thermal performance when compared to double-glazing,  
but they can also serve structural or fire protection functions. Most  
manufacturers recommend that glass blocks be used in shaded  
locations as the blocks can overheat or, in some cases, act as prisms  
with consequent risk of fire.  
# 7.7 Wind  
The Beaufort wind scale was initially developed for use at sea. It  
does not indicate wind speed and is usually replaced today by wind  
speed, measured 10 m above ground, in knots. Table XX provides  
a conversion chart.  
Wind loading on buildings varies with height, as friction with  
the ground slows down the wind at lower levels. This wind gradient  
is complex, but may be calculated. The American \(USA\) Building  
Codes give gradients levels of 300 m for cities, 400 m for suburbs  
and 500 m for flat open terrain. Structural engineers may use the  
power law wind speed profile given below\:  
Where\:  
*v*z = speed of the wind at height *z*  
*v*g = gradient wind at gradient height *z*g  
α = exponential coefficient  
*Effect of internal wind speeds in warm humid climates*  
We can measure the effect of air movement within buildings,  
Table XXI.  
*Hurricanes, typhoons, tsunami and tornadoes*  
Terminology varies from region to region. In addition to generating  
abnormally high wind loads, hurricanes, typhoons and tornadoes  
also cause extreme pressure differentials. Structural detailing and  
the fixing of non-structural elements must withstand the forces  
caused by the negative and positive pressure generated in these  
storms. Most countries experiencing these climatic events have  
appropriate building regulations concerning fixing and bracing for  
roofs, windows and structural design loadings. The risk of lightning  
strikes must also be considered. Electrical storms can be frequent  
and dramatic.  
*Sandstorms*  
Sandstorms present problems in arid conditions. The rate of sand  
transportation depends on wind speed, sand grain size and the  
amount of moisture in the sand. Wind-driven sand movements  
become a problem when wind speed measured at a height of 1 m  
above ground level exceeds 12 knots \(6 m per second\). Impact  
on buildings varies with building height, usually becoming more  
severe at greater heights. Tight closing of all openings is required to  
reduce nuisance from blown sand. Finishes may need to withstand  
scouring and abrasion. Complete protection is not usually practical. **Table XX Beaufort scale\: descriptors and equivalent speeds for use on land.**

# 7.8 Ventilation  
Data on ventilation requirements and on mechanical ventilation is  
now widely available from CIBSE and other professional engineer-  
ing institutions.  
# 7.9 Lag  
Time lag is the phase difference \(delay\) between external periodic  
variations in temperatures and the resulting internal temperature  
variations. The period of variations is 24 h and the lag is measured  
in hours. Table XXII gives time lag for homogeneous materials.  
For composite construction, the order in which different layers are  
placed can change the time lag considerably. If insulation is placed  
on the external surface of a dense material, the time lag is con-  
siderably increased. Table XXIII gives the time lag of a range of  
constructions. Although the time lag indicates when the thermal  
impact of outside temperature swings will affect the interior, the  
actual internal conditions can only be calculated when the heat flow  
into rooms and onto all room surfaces is considered.

*KEY POINTS*  
• *The UK higher education system is becoming increasingly*  
*diverse. This diversity is expressed in the use of space, particu-*  
*larly between teaching-led and research-led universities. Space*  
*will be subject increasingly to remodelling for new needs or*  
*to meet new standards. With imaginative design, space can be*  
*deployed flexibly to meet multiple uses*  
• *Increasingly, more provision is being made for student-led and*  
*‘blended learning’ \(a mixture of face-to-face plus IT-mediated*  
*learning\). This will demand more relatively small and adapt-*  
*able spaces. IT developments are enabling more intensive use of*  
*space for teaching and learning*

# 1 INTRODUCTION  
# 1.1 Definition  
Universities are places of learning and research in a variety of sub-  
jects at the highest level and are often, therefore, described as being  
institutes within the higher education \(HE\) sector. Derived from the  
Latin *universitas magistrorum et scholarium*, which could be trans-  
lated as a ‘corporation of masters and scholars’, the university was  
conceived as a place of academic freedom in contrast to specific  
training for crafts or trades in the medieval period. In time, uni-  
versities were authorised to confer degrees and are now significant  
contributors to national and regional economies all over the world.  
# 1.2 Scope  
Modern universities vary hugely, having differing emphases on  
subjects and research. Their locations and student base are also  
diverse. This section of the *Handbook* seeks to provide broad guid-  
ance for designers of sustainable new university facilities, but this  
guidance could be extended to upgrading or extending existing  
buildings. The range of accommodation examined represents the  
typical core building stock of modern, Western universities and  
may not all be relevant to every building, site or budget. Please note  
that this is written for a temperate UK/Western European climate  
and will not be suitable for other locations. The figures provided  
represent average or recommended dimensions and values and  
would be subject to adjustment for more specific requirements.  
# 1.3 History and types  
*Urban universities*  
The traditional university model has been linked with city life in Europe  
since the Universities of Bologna and Paris were founded in 1088 and  
1150 and later in Oxford \(1167\) and Cambridge \(1209\), Figure 41.1.  
The study of theology was central to university life and consequently  
these early institutes bore a strong relation to monasteries in their  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781003052586-44  
**41.1** *Cambridge town plan\: Cole and Roper map of Cambridge,*  
*1804*  
arrangements, being characterised by cloistered courtyards, chapels  
and refectories. Some would argue that Western universities may have  
been influenced by, or were based on, Islamic *Madrasah* schools in the  
ninth-century Middle East as observed by crusaders.  
*Collegiate universities*  
Many universities evolved into college-based institutes – the ear-  
liest include Paris, Oxford, Cambridge and, later, Durham. In this  
model, formal lectures, governance and administration are provided  
by the university; and the residential, dining, tutorial and pasto-  
ral functions are provided by member ‘colleges’ or ‘houses’. The  
non-college accommodation is normally organised into ‘schools’,  
‘faculties’ or departments and some ceremonial buildings.  
Consequently, the host cities, or city quarters, developed around  
these universities and their colleges over many centuries, and as  
such are largely defined by their presence. Scotland established  
four ‘Ancient’ universities between 1410 and 1582. In London,  
a number of large and almost independent colleges were founded  
from 1826 onwards, each acting as a quasi-university. Some of  
these specialised in subject areas such as science and engineering,  
as in the case of Imperial College London. Their buildings tend to  
**41-1** **41-2 Universities**  
cluster in city-centre sites later referred to as ‘campuses’ after the  
College of New Jersey \(later renamed Princeton University\).  
*Subsequent urban universities*  
There followed an explosion of university creation in major cities across  
the UK and Ireland from 1828 to 1909. Whilst these were not necessarily  
based on the collegiate model, some included colleges and most became  
important parts of inner-city life, often creating distinctive academic city  
‘quarters’. Their physical composition moved away from the monastic  
model, through classic palatial and towards Victorian civic grandeur.  
From 1992, over 70 new universities were created from for-  
mer polytechnics, ‘university colleges’ and HE institutes. Many of  
these occupied urban groupings that were consolidated from dis-  
parate buildings to create urban campuses. In this way, many new  
universities have more in common in urban terms with the ‘Ancient  
Universities’ than those of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.  
*Rural and suburban campus universities*  
Waves of university construction following the World Wars, driven  
by government policy aimed at social mobility, led to a prolifera-  
tion of sylvan campuses across Britain. Their compositions were  
varied and experimental, often laid out in response to masterplans  
by individual architects.  
*Further education*  
Further education \(FE\) is post-compulsory education that is distinct  
from education offered in universities, and has grown significantly  
to become recognised as a separate sector. It provides education,  
from basic training to HND or Foundation Degree. Institutions  
considered part of the FE sector include\:  
• General FE and tertiary colleges  
• Sixth form colleges  
• Specialist colleges \(e.g. land-based colleges\)  
• Adult education institutions.  
FE forms one part of a wider learning and skills sector, alongside  
workplace education and other types of non-school, non-university  
education and training. It provides 14- to 19-year-old learners with  
the opportunity to progress to HE and skilled employment. It also  
provides adult learners with access to basic skills, training for work  
and learning for personal development. FE planning and design  
guidelines and best practice are significantly different from HE and  
are therefore not included in this chapter.  
# 1.4 Site strategy  
The assessment of individual sites should make reference to the  
development masterplan for the campus, drawing together a holis-  
tic understanding of pedestrian routes, servicing strategy, key nodal  
points and public realm strategy. This in turn should inform the  
approach and clear primary entrance points, external/internal way-  
finding, connectivity and the external spaces between buildings.  
Developing ideas for making the campus more inviting by creat-  
ing transparency into student active zones/spaces should also be  
exploited. Understanding how students experience buildings and  
spaces from their own perspective is an important starting point.  
It is desirable to determine the nature and scope of all vehicle  
and pedestrian circulation routes within and around the campus to  
minimise conflict, including movement on/off the site that is sig-  
nificant to the effective operation of campus facilities in order to  
establish proper access and egress arrangements, compliance with  
Equality Act, aggregation of flows of traffic, people and materials,  
and control and security provisions.  
It is also important at the outset of the design process to develop  
clear concepts for maximising the flexibility and quality of the inter-  
nal spaces, focusing on the de-institutionalisation of circulation routes  
via creative impromptu interaction areas for students and staff, together  
with attractive and conducive internal vertical and horizontal circula-  
tion to enhance social contact, for example, atria, galleries, ‘streets’.  
# 1.5 Building form  
There are many matters to consider when designing university  
buildings\:  
• Use narrower, open plan floorplates \(12–13.5 m\) if maximum  
daylighting and natural cross-ventilation are desirable  
• Use the building form to enhance passive/low energy strategies.  
Consider the use of atria, solar chimneys, light wells and wind  
stacks to assist stack ventilation and make use of heat reclaim  
• Extend atria well beyond the roof level to prevent warm, stale air  
build-up affecting the occupants of the upper floors  
• Consider a compact building form with a low ratio of envelope\:  
floor area to reduce heat loss and heat gain  
• Consider high floor to ceiling dimensions to increase daylight pen-  
etration and to prevent warm, stale air build-up at occupant level.

• Orientate along east/west axis with primary north and south  
elevations  
• Eliminate solar gain as far as possible. South aspect is easier to  
control using screens, louvres and blinds. Also consider ratios of  
glazed\: opaque envelope and translucent insulation  
• East and west elevations get low angled sun, which can cause  
problems with glare. This is very difficult to control using stand-  
ard louvres.  
# 1.7 Energy use  
Potential ideas to minimise energy use could include\:  
• Maximising the integration of passive strategies \(orientation,  
prevailing wind\) to minimise the use of active systems that use  
energy \(e.g. wind/solar assisted ventilation\)  
• Investigating the use of thermal mass to absorb heat during the  
day and purge it at night to provide comfort conditions in the  
morning. This also reduces temperature swings within the space  
• Using natural or mixed-mode ventilation in preference to full air  
conditioning, where possible. Displacement ventilation is prefera-  
ble, as it requires lower energy use for the same cooling capacity.  
However, it also requires larger risers and underfloor voids  
• Optimising daylight whilst being aware of glare and solar gain.  
Consider narrow plan form, use of atria and lightwells, ceiling  
profile, high ceilings, prismatic glass and light-shelves  
• Recovering waste heat for pre-heating winter supply air for heat  
exchanging with hot water supply  
• Ensuring the correct balance of insulation within the façades to  
minimise winter heat loss and reduce summer solar gain \(south  
and west\)  
• Developing a low energy artificial lighting strategy and integrate the  
system with the daylighting. Use low energy light fittings and con-  
sider controls carefully \(occupancy detection, daylight sensors, etc.\)  
• Extracting air through or close to light fittings to extend lamp life  
and reduce heat gains  
• Designing the façades in relation to their specific orientation.  
Each will require a different combination of glazed areas, opaque  
areas, types of glass, blinds, louvres and screens  
• Minimising internal heat gains through specification of low  
heat-emitting appliances and lighting  
• Ensuring that the internal comfort criteria brief is realistic so that  
the services system is not over-designed for heat loads that may  
only occur during a few days of the year. This can lead to inef-  
ficient operation when the plant is running at lower capacities  
• Ensuring that the detail design maximises airtightness in cold  
weather as this is a major contributor to heat loss.  
# 1.8 Water  
• Maximise area of roof and landscaping for rainwater collection  
• Provide a storage tank within the landscape or basement for rain-  
water storage. **Universities 41-3**  
# 1.9 Health and well-being  
• Provide user control of lighting, humidity, heating and ventila-  
tion. This may be arranged by groups and linked to the telephone  
system and/or BMS  
• Provide openable windows where possible, as occupant control  
has psychological health and well-being benefit  
• Pay attention to landscaping and planting inside and out. This  
can be used to temper the environment through natural shading,  
cooling and humidifying. It has been shown that certain plants  
improve air quality within a building  
• Create indoor and outdoor spaces that encourage interaction,  
social exchange and a sense of community  
• Integrate water and planting to improve air quality, natural  
humidity and improve occupants’ sense of well-being.  
# 2 SPACE TYPES  
# 2.1 Introduction  
The UK HE system is becoming increasingly diverse. This increas-  
ing diversity is leading to diverging approaches to the use of space,  
particularly between teaching-led and research-led universities.  
Space will be increasingly subject to remodelling to meet changing  
needs and new standards. With imaginative design, space can be  
deployed flexibly to meet multiple uses.  
‘Learning space’ is seen as one of these new needs, with more  
provision being made for student-led and ‘blended learning’ \(a mix-  
ture of face-to-face plus IT-mediated learning\). This will demand  
more relatively small and adaptable spaces. IT developments are  
enabling more intensive use of space for teaching and learning.  
An educational building is an expensive long-term resource and  
the design of its individual spaces need to be\:  
• Flexible\: to accommodate both current and evolving pedagogies  
• Future-proofed\: to enable space to be re-allocated and reconfigured  
• Bold\: to look beyond tried and tested technologies and pedagogies  
• Creative\: to energise and inspire learners and tutors  
• Supportive\: to develop the potential of all learners  
• Enterprising\: to make each space capable of supporting different  
purposes.  
Learning space should be able to motivate learners and promote  
learning as an activity; support collaborative as well as formal  
practice; provide a personalised and inclusive environment; and be  
flexible in the face of changing needs. Technology plays a key role  
in achieving these aims.  
# 2.2 General teaching and learning space  
The design of most general teaching and learning spaces will  
need to support both tutor-led and learner-led activities. These  
will include presentations, discussion, collaborative project work  
and information retrieval and sharing. Future technological and  
pedagogic developments cannot always be anticipated, but it is  
important that the design can accommodate change.  
Most universities consider general teaching rooms as non-dedi-  
cated space, shared across faculties and the entire campus. As such,  
the rooms should be centrally located providing convenient access  
to all users.  
Centralised online booking systems increase the effectiveness  
of managing space utilisation of general teaching space, and some  
universities have adopted space charging as a measure against block  
booking of rooms. Centralised bookable general teaching rooms typ-  
ically comprise a range of spaces with varying capacities, as follows\:  
• Lecture theatres – large \(250\); medium \(120\); small \(90\)  
• Seminar rooms – large \(60\); medium \(30\); small \(15\)  
• IT rooms – various capacities used \(30+\), although increasingly  
access to IT is via social learning spaces or libraries  
• Tutorial rooms – \(5–6\).  
*Key issues*  
The design of the space should consider the following\:  
• Daylight control  
• Ventilation, including control by room users  
• Registration technology  
• Viewing angles/sightlines  
• Lighting  
• Acoustic performance  
• Reconfiguration  
• Audio visual facilities and controls  
• Signage and booking systems.  
There are no specific standards in the UK for the acoustic  
performance of university teaching spaces. However, *Building*  
*Bulletin 93\: Acoustic design in schools* may be used for guidance.  
# 2.3 Lecture theatres  
Lecture theatres need to be flexible in terms of configuration and  
capacity to meet the demands of varying teaching programmes,  
modes of learning and timetabling. This will allow spaces to adapt  
to evolving pedagogies and future change. However, it is the  
three-dimensional form of the space and the relationship between  
presenter and audience that should be the primary considerations.  
\(See also Chapter 15 Auditoria.\)  
The following should be considered when developing design  
proposals\:  
*Strategic issues*  
• Location within the building  
• Movement of people  
• Wayfinding  
• Foyer space – pre/post lecture milling and cross-over space  
• Access/egress points  
• Occupancy/capacity  
• Refreshments/catering provision  
• WCs and cloakrooms.  
*Uses*  
• Single or multiple speaker presentations  
• Q&A sessions  
• Panel discussions  
• Collaborative working formats  
• Digital presentations  
• Conferences.  
*Layout/configuration*  
• Presentation area – flat or raised platform  
• Seating configuration – straight, angled, curved  
• Fixed rake or retractable bleacher seating  
• Sightlines  
• AV requirements – screen size, repeater screens  
• Means of escape  
• Seat design – tip-up, individual fixed, continuous fixed, with or  
without armrests  
• Writing surface – fixed tablet arm, folding tablet arm, fixed con-  
tinuous writing surface  
• Lectern design  
• Power, data, microphones  
• Inclusive design including wheelchair location, hearing induc-  
tion loop.  
*Supporting facilities*  
• Projection facilities  
• Sound and lighting facilities  
• Translation/interpretation facilities  
• Registration/access control equipment  
• Ticketing/box office  
• Equipment and furniture storage. **41-4 Universities**  
# 2.4 IT rooms  
Although technology is increasingly moving away from dedicated  
computer rooms, for some courses there may still be a requirement  
for intensive, screen-based teaching, which will require a dedicated  
environmental solution.  
# 2.5 Tutorial rooms  
Many universities are removing tutorial space from within academic  
staff offices and providing bookable tutorial rooms that can also be used  
for staff meetings, interviews, confidential work/discussion, private  
study, professional visitors, etc. In some universities, there is a move  
away from individual tutorials to small group tutorials \(5–6 students\).  
# 2.6 Informal and social learning spaces  
The provision of a variety of learning spaces that complement  
timetabled general teaching space is an essential requirement in HE  
buildings. Spaces designed to support learning outside of formal  
teaching spaces, either in groups or individually, have therefore  
become an accepted norm in university space design.  
Well-designed social learning spaces are likely to increase students’  
motivation and positively impacts on their engagement with learning.  
High quality space for informal learning also enhances the profile of  
the university, presenting prospective students with a dynamic learning  
environment. Social spaces should therefore be given a high priority  
in new design proposals. If catering facilities, common rooms, even  
circulation spaces are considered as social meeting and group learning  
environments, universities could improve space efficiency and make a  
statement about their vision for learning as a pervasive and inclusive  
activity based on social interaction, see Figure 41.2.  
The following social learning spaces support the varying needs  
of students throughout the day\:  
*Individual or group informal settings*  
Often located in highly visible settings within buildings, these  
areas support social interaction and blur the lines between social  
and study modes. Key features include\:  
• Soft seating with low tables  
• Proximity to vending or café spaces  
• Local power, potentially within certain zones rather than built  
into all furniture  
• A range of seating options supporting a range of groupings.  
*Individual formal settings*  
The term ‘social learning’ implies conversation and exchange in a  
social setting. However, the need for individual study desks, often,  
but not always, incorporated into libraries, is still extremely impor-  
tant to students. These settings are characterised by\:  
• Generally quiet environments  
• Task lighting  
• Power built into furniture  
• Within an open setting  
• Formal desk arrangements.  
These settings can also include ‘pod’ type spaces to provide  
additional privacy, set within an open plan area.  
*Group formal settings*  
Increasingly valued by students are small rooms for group study  
and work. These rooms are acoustically protected from the sur-  
rounding area\:  
• Single formal central table  
• Screens for presentation  
• Integrated data  
• Formal seating for 4–8 people.  
The mix of these space types within a learning commons, library  
or an academic building will vary from project to project, but it is  
always advisable to offer a range of settings with a range of envi-  
ronmental conditions \(from bright, open spaces to inward-looking  
‘retreat’ type spaces\) to cater for individual preferences.  
The large central learning centre is now a multifunctional facil-  
ity providing social spaces, student services and study support,  
book and laptop loan, access to IT, and different kinds of working  
environments, from comfortable seating for collaborative group  
work, to ‘board rooms’ for practice presentations. Elements of  
teaching may also take place within a learning centre environment.  
These varied purposes demand a clear vision for each area within  
the centre. Zones for different modes of learning are common strat-  
egies. Sound and visual clues, layout and style of furniture, and  
different technologies in different configurations can signal the dif-  
ferent purposes of areas.  
# 2.7 Libraries  
The university library is traditionally the heart of the campus.  
Trends in social learning and information gathering, driven by  
wireless technology and online databases, have resulted in the need  
for libraries to flex and adapt to accommodate a wider variety of  
research methods and spaces. However, regardless of changes to  
learning over recent years, there is still a strong role for the library  
to play on campus as a focus for quiet study and research. More  
intensive use is being seen in longer library opening hours, with  
24-hour opening during the working week becoming more com-  
mon, especially where many students are part-time. \(For further  
guidance, see also Chapter 26 Libraries.\)  
**41.2** *The Brooks Building, Manchester Metropolitan University, designed by Sheppard Robson. The ‘Spanish Steps’ provide valuable*  
*social and informal learning space, complementing traditional seminar rooms* *Key design issues*  
The following should be considered when developing designs for  
university libraries\:  
• Number of volumes on site  
• High demand publications  
• Special collections  
• Categorisation method  
• Roller racking \(if space is at a premium\)  
• Accessibility  
• Community access  
• Line of security  
• Types of study space and social learning provision  
• Furniture  
• Access to online services and other research sources  
• Library catering  
• Library staff offices and support spaces  
• Co-location of recycling facilities with print stations  
• AV to group study spaces, monitors with laptop connectivity and  
write-on surfaces broaden the experience  
• Digital signage for communication with library users  
• Access to drinking water  
• Distribution of WCs  
• Lockers for personal storage  
• Automation of book returns.  
*Environmental factors*  
The environmental quality of a library is critical for the experience  
of the library user. Typical design considerations for libraries are  
as follows\:  
• Acoustic challenges of natural ventilation  
• Maximising natural daylight  
• Control of glare  
• Correct balance between background and task lighting  
• Zoning of acoustically similar activities  
• Acoustic impact of finishes, e.g. hard floor surfaces can disturb  
learners.  
*Library support functions*  
The following types of space are needed to support the library\:  
• Library enquiry/information point – counter, desk, storage \(sat-  
ellite floor-based enquiry desks\)  
• Library administration – offices, workrooms, storage  
• IT administration – offices, workrooms, storage  
• Open stack space – books, periodicals, DVDs, CDs  
• Compact shelving  
• Library support facilities – self issue/return, online public access  
catalogues, printing/photocopying, collection bins  
• Careers section.  
# 2.8 Specialist teaching and research spaces  
These are either\:  
• Teaching spaces that by virtue of particular servicing, fit-out or  
uses need to be dedicated to a particular function or school, but  
which could be accommodated in a standard structural shell  
• Teaching spaces that by virtue of particular dimensional, loading  
or servicing requirements cannot fit into a standard shell.  
Such spaces include science laboratories, music rooms and  
other specialist facilities as detailed in what follows.  
# 2.9 Laboratories  
Undergraduate \(UG\), postgraduate \(PG\) and research laboratory  
requirements are unique to each university. This section focuses on  
# Universities 41-5  
university teaching and research requirements, and should be read  
in conjunction with Chapter 25 Laboratories.  
University laboratories and science learning spaces are  
designed to enthuse and stimulate students through active learning.  
This encourages enquiry-based learning through online platforms  
that involve video clips, interactive simulations, interactive sim-  
ulations, virtual lectures or annotated digital slides to observe,  
understand and practise techniques before attending practical  
laboratory classes. Another recent trend within universities is to  
co-locate disciplines within multidisciplinary accommodation to  
increase collaboration whilst achieving high levels of utilisation.  
University laboratory space needs vary markedly between  
schools and departments, the types of teaching or research being  
undertaken and specific equipment needs. There are a number of  
different types of ‘primary’ university laboratories, including\:  
*Wet laboratory*  
Large capacity labs with ‘wet’ services, with the following key  
features\:  
• Demonstrations shown on repeater screens to the benching bays  
• Benching arrangements will depend on the activity within the  
laboratory  
• Areas for fixed and mobile equipment  
• Student glass storage \(often by a personal lockable cupboard\)  
and all personal items are stored externally to the laboratory  
environment.  
Examples of use include chemistry, chemical engineering,  
microbiology, pharmacy, biochemistry.  
*Dry laboratory*  
Large capacity labs with ‘dry’ electrical services, with the follow-  
ing key features\:  
• Demonstration points/repeater screen technology is often specified  
• Flexibility within the benching arrangements to suit the wider  
range of uses  
• PC workstations to each workspace.  
Examples of use include electrical engineering, geology, earth  
sciences and environmental sciences.  
*E-laboratory*  
The E-lab is a large IT resource that allows students to under-  
take experiments before moving into a potentially hazardous and  
expensive laboratory space, and is now commonplace within many  
universities. E-laboratories enable traditional labs to be used more  
efficiently and is utilised by many scientific disciplines.  
*‘Discovery’ laboratory*  
Within some universities, there is an emphasis on providing a  
laboratory space which allows students to develop within a self-di-  
rected environment; this space is often used for open days, external  
engagement, outreach and display.  
*Specialist spaces*  
Specialist spaces will depend on the disciplines being taught. These  
may consist of spaces which require close control, improved acous-  
tic or vibration performance criteria. Research/post graduate spaces  
are often cellular in nature and are brief specific.  
*Support spaces*  
Supporting spaces should include the following\:  
• Write-up/informal learning  
• Write-up space for post graduates/PhD  
• Preparation rooms **41-6 Universities**  
• Storage  
• Specialist storage – chemicals, solvents and gas can be stored  
either externally or internally; refer to HSE Control of Substances  
Hazardous to Health guidelines  
• Workshops – a small workshop may be required for repairing  
equipment  
• Loading bay/goods handling – laboratories have a high number  
of consumables; adequate space for temporary storage and audit-  
ing of incoming/outgoing goods should be provided.  
# 2.10 Music  
Music can be studied at a university, or at a specialist college, acad-  
emy or conservatoire. The spaces in a music department consist of a  
range of rooms of different sizes, with stringent acoustic requirements.  
Accommodation requirements will vary, but the following is a guide\:  
• Music classrooms \(dedicated\) – large learning and teaching spaces  
• Practice rooms – solo, group, ensemble  
• Music technology \(digital\) and keyboard rooms  
• Instrument and other stores – department/school use, student use  
• Music library and resource area – including music scores, CDs,  
DVDs  
• Rehearsal studios  
• Recital studios  
• Recording/control studios  
• Performance space \(or shared use of a central university facility\)  
• Small breakout spaces associated with music rooms  
• Academic staff rooms and support.  
*Environmental considerations*  
Music rooms are for creating and listening to sound and therefore  
an appropriate acoustic environment is essential. The following  
should be considered\:  
• The aim is to enable people to hear music clearly, without dis-  
traction and with suitable enhancement by the room acoustics  
• The two main acoustic concerns are sound quality and sound  
insulation  
• The main influences on the quality of musical sounds are room  
volume, room geometry and surface finishes  
• Successful sound separation between spaces depends on good  
planning, structure and construction detail \(partitions, doors,  
windows and vents should be appropriately insulated\)  
• The location of the music department/school, relative to other  
department/schools \(or neighbours\), should be carefully considered.  
*Space planning principles*  
Most music departments host a range of activities and events includ-  
ing performances outside the normal teaching day. All these activities  
will involve groups of people \(students, staff, external musicians\)  
arriving and leaving throughout the day. Therefore, the location of the  
departments should make this as easy as possible, whilst maintaining  
security. Important points to consider when planning space are\:  
• Avoiding acoustic disturbance with neighbouring spaces, includ-  
ing external spaces  
• Ensuring music spaces are near to other facilities that will be  
used for musical activities  
• Creating easy access for the movement of musical instruments  
and equipment for performance in spaces outside the depart-  
ment/school  
• Providing a separate dedicated reception that can be used outside  
normal hours without compromising overall security.  
# 2.11 Business schools  
Business studies can be studied at either a business school or  
department within a university, or at an independent international  
graduate school and research institution.  
*University-based business schools*  
UG teaching is usually undertaken in centrally timetabled, general  
teaching accommodation such as lecture theatres, seminar rooms  
and IT rooms. Depending on the university, a dedicated UG work-  
room and lounge may be provided within the school.  
Postgraduate teaching \(PGT\) and research \(PGR\) is usually  
undertaken in dedicated accommodation and can comprise\:  
• Lecture theatres \(small\) \(stepped amphitheatre-style with contin-  
uous writing desks and fixed seating\)  
• Seminar rooms \(small\)  
• Syndicate rooms \(conference style\)  
• PGT group workspace \(drop-in facility, with wireless connec-  
tivity\)  
• PGT computer lab \(learning facility\)  
• PGR group workspace \(café-style linked to syndicate rooms,  
with wireless connectivity\)  
• PGR social space.  
The MBA \(Masters of Business Administration\) accommoda-  
tion is often planned as a dedicated suite of accommodation within  
the business school or department and comprises\:  
• Reception, social/interaction/breakout space, refreshment bar/  
service  
• Lecture theatres \(small\) \(stepped amphitheatre-style with contin-  
uous writing desks in wide rows and mobile/revolving executive  
chairs\)  
• Seminar rooms \(small\) \(café-style with circular tables and  
mobile/revolving executive chairs, with wireless connectivity\)  
• Syndicate rooms \(mobile/revolving executive chairs around con-  
ference tables, with wireless connectivity\)  
• General teaching rooms – sizes to suit the student cohorts  
• IT laboratories – to facilitate use of specialist software linked to  
the taught programme  
• Boardroom pitch room – for practising pitching to potential  
clients  
• Meeting rooms – formal rooms with media walls  
• Informal/social learning spaces in various configurations  
• External partner suite – dedicated suite for industry partners to  
hire/utilise for CPD and/or student engagement  
• Observation rooms – two-way mirror observation suite supported  
by playback facilities  
• One-to-one rooms  
• Multi-faith room – business schools attract a diverse interna-  
tional student intake  
• Catering  
• ‘Executive catering’ – the facility may host functions and CPD  
events; consideration of external partners hospitality spaces may  
be advisable  
• Innovation/incubator space  
• Conferencing facilities – should central conferencing facilities  
not be available a dedicated facility may be required.  
A few schools may incorporate a dedicated Executive Training  
Suite offering custom training to professionals. It will need to be  
easily accessible for evening customers and comprises\:  
• Reception, social/interaction/breakout space, refreshment bar/  
service  
• Executive training room \(small\) \(café-style circular tables with  
mobile/revolving executive chairs\)  
• Reference/resource facilities.  
A dedicated Financial Markets Suite is often included in a busi-  
ness school to provide UG and PG students training in a simulated  
dealing room environment. *Independent graduate business schools*  
These institutions are pre-eminent global graduate business schools  
\(e.g. Harvard, INSEAD, London Business School, see Figure 41.3\)  
that specialise in offering ‘top-class’ MBAs and executive educa-  
tion. They have complete operational independence and separate  
funding. Depending on their vision, aims and objectives they will  
have different approaches and operational areas for the following\:  
• Teaching – MBAs, EMBAs, MiFs, executive education \(open  
and custom programmes\), PhDs  
• Research – faculty working on specialist research initiatives  
based on chosen subject areas  
• External relations – school brand/fundraising, alumni, communi-  
cations, development, events  
• Support departments – finance/accounts, information services,  
careers, facilities, human resources  
• Office accommodation – PG/PhD \(touch down and/or open plan  
office space\); ‘staff office’ \(central space for student enquires  
etc.\); programme support staff spaces \(if not provided centrally  
by institution\)  
• Outreach activities.  
Comprehensive programmes of evening and day events  
will take place throughout the year, such as residential courses,  
conferences, corporate presentations, networking, ceremonies, dis-  
tinguished speaker lectures, recruitment and alumni reunions. Most  
of these events will require good quality residential accommoda-  
tion, conferencing, community networking and catering facilities.  
The planning, design and range of accommodation and the quality  
of the physical space will be characterised by the spirit and ethos of  
the school, and the school’s perceived international brand.  
The range of accommodation for teaching MBAs will be similar  
to university-based schools except the quality and space standards  
will be higher. Similarly, executive education accommodation will  
be of a higher quality, more extensive and include a business cen-  
tre, breakout and refreshment areas for delegates.  
Additional facilities will include\:  
• Conference centre – high quality large theatre/hall with cinema  
style seating, including reception/registration area, foyer/break-  
out space and hospitality service  
• Large community networking space  
• A range of catering facilities – banqueting and hospitality \(break-  
fast/lunch/dinner\), restaurant with service, café, coffee bar/shop  
and dispersed refreshment zones

# Universities 41-7  
• Teaching support – PC labs, library/resource centre and study spaces  
• Student services/support facilities  
• Alumni centre  
• Offices – faculty, support, admin staff  
• School reception area – visitors, information, exhibition.  
Environmental considerations for lecture/conference facilities may  
include\:  
• Naturally lit and air-conditioned  
• Programmable lighting and blackout  
• Sound reinforcement, microphones and high quality acoustics  
• Wireless network, video/filming facilities  
• Interactive whiteboards, projection and LCD screens  
• Control of environment from lecturer’s desk/console.  
# 2.12 Art and design  
Art is studied at a department or school within a university faculty  
of creative arts or at a specialist art college. Art is a practical and  
creative discipline in which students learn through investigation,  
observation, analysis and experimentation. Students work in both  
two and three dimensions and at a range of scales. Typical courses  
that need to be provided may include\:  
• Drawing  
• Graphic design and illustration  
• Painting  
• Screen printing  
• Photography/moving image  
• Textiles/embroidery/fashion/costume design  
• Ceramics/glass  
• Jewellery  
• Sculpture  
• Digital media including desktop publishing, animation and mul-  
ti-media.  
Supplementary and storage spaces may include\:  
• Resource areas  
• Dark rooms and screen processing room for screen prints  
• Editing and production suites  
• Prep/cleaning areas  
• Screening room  
• Clay, damp and plaster stores  
• Kiln rooms  
• Wood, metal and stone equipment stores  
• Secure dye store  
• Media consumables store  
• Laser cutting laboratory  
• 3D and 2D printing and binding  
• Display/exhibition space  
• Student work stores.  
*Primary design considerations*  
The location and orientation of the art department or school can  
affect the accommodation in a number of ways. Some of the main  
considerations are listed in what follows\:  
• Daylight – maximise daylight but control glare and solar gain,  
where fine detail and colour rendering are important  
• Increase ceiling heights and maximise surface reflectance  
• Acoustics – noise disturbance between dissimilar disciplines  
working in the same or adjacent spaces  
• Ventilation – extraction systems needed for specialist activities  
and equipment including removal of heat, noxious gases/fumes,  
dark room chemicals, dust and aerosols/airbrushes  
• Artificial light – an even spread of light without glare. Adopt  
recommended luminance levels and colour rendering of lamps **41-8 Universities**  
• Direct access to sheltered outside areas for external work for  
messy or large scale projects  
• Co-location between departments with shared resources  
• Delivery of bulky or heavy materials  
• Display areas for student work  
• Store rooms directly accessible from the studio spaces.  
Suites of art spaces are sometimes designed as open plan areas  
which can create a sense of light and space, and provide greater  
flexibility. However, noise transmission and dust can be a problem  
in open plan areas such as sculpture and ceramics. Open plan areas  
also need to provide sufficient pin-up space.  
*Other considerations*  
• Folding display walls and mobile display panels for exhibition  
and display  
• A central furniture, fixtures and equipment store or area within  
the workshops/studios  
• Durability and design of fixed partitions in art studios  
• Photo studios as black boxes with no daylight, requiring ‘infinity  
walls’ for fashion and other shoots  
• Flexible social learning areas that could be converted into an  
exhibition space or a catwalk  
• Secure personal storage, dining and kitchenette provision to  
cater for longer hours of operation  
• Water supply in studios and workshops. Heavy duty sinks in art,  
ceramic, sculpture, screen print and dye studios  
• Clay traps to sinks in ceramic studios  
• Overhead power supply.  
# 2.13 Teacher training/education  
Teacher training is provided at a faculty of education or at a school/  
department of education which is part of a larger university faculty.  
General teaching classrooms are required for subjects such as  
maths, English and modern foreign languages, humanities and  
business studies, and for the early years stage. Specialist accom-  
modation is required for all subjects taught in the primary and  
secondary education curriculums, including\:  
• Science \(primary and secondary laboratories, prep rooms, stores,  
greenhouses\)  
• Design & Technology \(D&T classrooms, textile classrooms,  
laser cutting workshops and dedicated stores\)  
• Food technology \(food tech classrooms, dedicated stores and  
prep rooms\)  
• Art \(general studios, ceramic/wet studios, kiln rooms, photogra-  
phy/dark rooms and portfolio display areas\)  
• Music \(large ensemble studios, practice rooms, mixing/digital  
studios and storage\)  
• Drama \(drama studios, costume stores with make-up facilities, light-  
ing/AV control rooms, provision for theory sessions and research\)  
• PE \(sports halls, gyms, changing rooms, storage, dance studios,  
provision for theory sessions\)  
• IT \(IT labs, stores\).  
Relevant school Building Bulletins can be used as a guide for  
designing the specialist accommodation and supporting spaces.  
*Science accommodation*  
Both primary and secondary science laboratories will be required.  
Preparation areas should allow for controlled student access.  
Separate chemical and radioactive stores will also be required.  
The following laboratories will be required\:  
• Primary school labs \(flexible layout with perimeter benching\)  
• Biology and life sciences \(flexible layout with perimeter benching\)  
• General/physics \(flexible layout with perimeter benching or  
fixed pods with sinks\)  
• Chemistry \(with fixed gas and water pods, fume cupboards\).  
*PE accommodation*  
The provision for PE accommodation will depend on the particular  
courses offered by the university, but will typically require\:  
• A small- to medium-sized sports hall \(compliance with national  
standard sports hall sizes and competition standards is not  
required but may be beneficial if the facilities are to be used by  
the wider community\)  
• A gym  
• Adjacent changing facilities  
• An equipment store adjacent to the sports hall.  
Secondary PE courses will be as above but may also include\:  
• A 4–6 court sports hall \(compliance with national standards for  
sports hall sizes and competition standards is recommended\)  
• A dance studio.  
A provision for theory sessions such as a teaching alcove or a  
separate seminar room adjacent to the sports hall will be required.  
Separate student and staff changing facilities may be required.  
Community use and a provision of family changing cubicles should  
be considered where appropriate.  
Teacher training courses incorporate extensive work placement  
as part of the curriculum and place a high demand for one-to-one  
confidential interview rooms. Bookable interview/meeting rooms  
should be provided and are best located in dedicated clusters adja-  
cent to flexible social learning areas.  
# 2.14 Nursing and health professionals  
Nursing may be provided as a course within a faculty of health and/  
or in conjunction with other courses such as midwifery, psychology  
and social care. The core specialist accommodation for the course  
is the provision of nursing laboratories. These are designed as  
mock-up hospital wards intended to replicate the provision within a  
hospital, and include hospital beds with hoists, power, compressed  
air/vacuum supply and facilities to deliver theory sessions \(LED  
screens and flexible seating\). Associated facilities may include\:  
• A facility where students can be trained to use hoists  
• A simulation suite equipped with interactive mannequins, one-  
way mirrors and specialist AV  
• Assisted living teaching facilities to teach carers/health profes-  
sionals how to look after patients in a domestic environment.  
These can be provided within the nursing laboratories or as a sep-  
arate room with domestic furniture and finishes and a mock-up  
bathroom/shower and toilet  
• A facility for external carers. The room will include a variety  
of soft seating including high back support chairs and nursing  
chairs, allowing for meetings and interviews with students  
• A separate breastfeeding teaching room  
• Dedicated equipment storage.  
# 2.15 Engineering  
An engineering facility will consist of many types of accommo-  
dation. The key spaces that will distinguish it from other types of  
education/university spaces will be the\:  
• Laboratories  
• Workshops  
• Teaching and research spaces  
• Ancillary spaces \(including support, stores and material stores\).  
Engineering encompasses a wide range of disciplines and may  
include multidisciplinary/cross-department teaching. Each dis-  
cipline is likely to have unique as well as generic requirements.  
Some of the types of department and the individual requirements  
to consider are\: • Civil and structural\: resilience and robustness testing of items  
and assemblies often to destructive levels, requiring strong  
floors/walls/rooms and temperature-controlled spaces  
• Electrical and electronic\: access to low and high voltage and  
three phase power supplies, soldering and circuit printing  
\(potentially requiring specialist extract and lighting\), anti-static  
and electromagnetic considerations  
• Chemical and nuclear \(use of radioactive and chemical materi-  
als in gas, liquid and powered forms requiring specialist storage,  
containment and distribution requirements, fume cupboards and  
other specialist equipment requiring specialist ventilation and  
piped services, personnel safety and decontamination equipment  
such as showers\)  
• Automotive and aeronautic \(aerodynamic and performance test-  
ing of components and assemblies, potentially wind tunnels,  
rolling roads and jet engine testing spaces – with necessary  
acoustic and temperature controls/containment\)  
• Mechanical \(equipment for the fabrication and testing of compo-  
nents across a range of materials, traditionally metal and timber  
but increasingly making use of new technologies including rapid  
prototyping and water/laser cutting\).  
Design considerations may include\:  
• Large working areas  
• Material/resource stores  
• Specialist extract and ventilation  
• Acoustic controls separation  
• Drainage and water supply  
• Environmental controls  
• Lighting, including specialist requirements \(such as blackout,  
yellow lighting \(for lithography\), etc.\)  
• Vibration  
• Incorporation of digital recording material \(such as sensors to  
primary structure\)  
• Access control and security  
• Remote equipment controls  
• Dangerous substances and explosive atmosphere regulations and  
other regulatory restrictions  
• Provision of pipe services including compressed air and special-  
ist gases  
• Clean rooms and environments.  
*Space planning*  
The space planning for an engineering building should consider  
the following\:  
• A clear legible layout – including zoning, links between front of  
house, clear separation between testing/experiment spaces and  
set-down/write-up areas  
• Safe circulation zones – including protected escape routes in  
high-risk areas  
• Safe/clear marked working zones around equipment  
• Easy access to resources and materials – including teaching  
walls as well as equipment  
• Clear delivery routes and loading areas  
• Clear service strategy – with built-in future flexibility  
• Visibility – to consider visibility from a safety perspective as  
well as cross-departmental interaction/connectivity  
• Storage – both departmental and student such as lockers  
• Clear security line – more secure spaces located deeper into the  
building  
• Areas that may require 24-hour access.  
It is important to design in flexibility to the building and indi-  
vidual spaces to ensure future adaptability to incorporate new  
technologies, working methods and services. The key to designing  
for engineering is an understanding of the requirements early on.  
# Universities 41-9  
Due consideration needs to be given to the aforementioned criteria  
in light of specific requirements and look to maximise flexibility  
for future developments.  
# 2.16 Incubators  
An incubator is a term given to a facility that fosters and encour-  
ages entrepreneurship and minimises obstacles to new business  
formation and growth. It provides the opportunity for ‘start-ups’  
and ‘spin-offs’.  
*Start-ups and spin-offs*  
The incentive confronting an individual or group that discovers  
a significant invention is a choice between start-up and spin-off.  
‘Start-up’ is the term given to the choice that keeps the intellec-  
tual property rights \(knowledge\) of the invention, acquires start-up  
capital or ‘seed’ funding and forms a new company to develop the  
invention. ‘Spin-off’ is the term given to the choice that transfers  
the knowledge of the invention to an existing company to gain  
substantial benefit via compensation, profits or shares from devel-  
opment of the invention.  
*University incubators*  
University incubators aim to\:  
• Create a bridge between education and the economy  
• Accelerate technology transfer between the university and com-  
panies  
• Sponsor ‘spin-offs’ from academia and create ‘start-ups’.  
Originally, incubators were located in abandoned or underused  
university buildings, but have since grown rapidly and developed  
into new, high quality purpose-built ‘centres’ affiliated to univer-  
sities. These ‘centres’ will vary in the facilities provided reflecting  
and influenced by the research focus \(science, technology, busi-  
ness\) of the affiliated university. Many UK universities have  
new-build ‘centres’ and their growth continues. Within these cen-  
tres, incubator units will be planned on a modular basis and can  
vary in size from 10 m2 to 500 m2, with a mix of office, science  
or technology-type units, together with all the supporting facilities  
and services.  
Types of accommodation will vary but may include\:  
• Modular labs \(200 m2\) fitted out with write-up and wet lab areas  
• Flexi-labs \(500 m2\) either wet lab, office or combination  
• Offices \(10 to 200 m2\) for SMEs  
• Workshop facilities  
• Meeting rooms, conferencing and exhibition space  
• Reception and visitor areas  
• Mailing, faxing and copying services  
• Computer services, including secure internet connections  
• Cleaning and security facilities  
• Kitchen facilities, local catering  
• Business support links – finance, legal, public funding, banking,  
accountancy, patent agents.  
To protect the confidential and novel nature of the research  
and development work being undertaken, 24/7 high-level access  
and security control to the building is important, with additional  
dedicated access and security control to each of the inner modular  
incubator units.  
# 2.17 Student support facilities  
The provision of student support facilities may be allocated on  
a university wide basis, site/campus basis or faculty basis. The  
content and location will primarily be determined by the univer-  
sity’s estate strategy, and secondly by the needs of each faculty.  
Accommodation requirements will vary, but the following is a  
guide\: **41-10 Universities**  
*Student union*  
• Student union and association offices

Similar functions, such as the student union and student services  
could be co-located to form a central focus for students on campus –  
namely a ‘student centre’ – provided that security and confidentially  
are not compromised.  
# 2.18 Staff facilities  
The provision of staff facilities may be allocated either on a site/  
campus-wide or faculty basis. The content and location will primar-  
ily be determined by the university’s estate strategy and secondly  
by the needs of each faculty. Accommodation requirements will  
vary, but the following is a guide\:  
• Staff common room \(including refreshments\)  
• Staff meeting and interview rooms  
• Storage \(archives, records, stationery, equipment\)  
• Staff print and post room  
• Porter’s room  
• Computer systems manager’s office

• Faculty-based staff resource centre  
• Faculty-based externally funded research institute space \(includ-  
ing reception\).  
# 2.19 Public facilities  
It is important that the main entrance to a university should be wel-  
coming and appeal to visitors as well as its regular users. Facilities  
available for public use should be easily accessible from the main  
entrance without compromising security or user movement.  
Accommodation requirements will vary, but the following is a guide\:  
• Main reception desk area  
• Visitors waiting and collection area  
• Information and exhibition area \(including displays of student  
output and future events\)  
• External affairs office \(college/school liaison\)  
• Security control point  
• Security control office.  
# 2.20 Conference facilities  
Many universities aspire to have world-class conference facilities  
to host corporate and distinguished speaker events, presentations,  
symposia and conferences. Conference facilities are expensive if  
underutilised and therefore the auditoria should also be considered for  
formal teaching of large and medium size cohort lecture groups. The  
accommodation requirements will vary, but the following is a guide\:  
• Auditoria \(300 seat and 150 seat\), consider flexible usage, poten-  
tial sub-division  
• Foyer/break-out/interaction/display space  
• Hospitality service room  
• Equipment/store room  
• Control room  
• Green room  
• Cloakrooms  
• Flexible exhibition space at or near the entrance  
• Potential for retractable seating within auditorium spaces  
• Furniture storage  
• Breakout areas  
• Back of house areas for the delivery and temporary installation of  
goods and equipment, including lighting and audio equipment.  
# 2.21 Catering facilities  
Catering facilities may be allocated on a university wide basis or  
site/campus basis. The provision will generally include a central  
facility supplemented by dispersed satellite refreshment facilities  
located in various academic buildings. The content and location  
will be determined by the university’s estate strategy and generally  
franchised to outside catering specialists. Under this arrangement,  
the university provides the built space with the catering specialist  
providing the supply and service of food/drinks, equipment and  
staff. The accommodation requirements will vary, but the follow-  
ing is a guide for a central facility.  
*Informal and formal dining*  
• Food court – buffet style \(including seating, servery, self-service  
islands and ‘back of house facilities’\)  
• Deli bar \(including seating, servery, self-service gondolas and  
‘back of house’ facilities\)

ple for social learning and collaborative working  
• Signage, branding and lighting design  
• Wi-Fi coverage and AV provision  
• Data points for tills and vending machines.  
Additional refreshments areas may include vending machines with  
cold drinks and snacks. Hot drink machines are becoming less  
popular as the provision of branded coffee bars becomes more  
common. Dedicated external dining areas \(decks, terraces, etc.\)  
should also be considered as part of amenities. **2.22 Retail facilities**  
The provision of retail facilities may be allocated on a university  
wide basis or site/campus basis. The content and location will  
primarily be determined by the university’s estate strategy and  
generally franchised to outside retail outlets. Under this arrange-  
ment, the university provides the built space with the retail outlets  
providing the supply and service of goods, equipment and staff.  
The accommodation requirements will vary, but the following is  
a guide\:  
• Bookshop  
• University memorabilia/giftware  
• Banking \(including ATMs\)  
• News agency/refreshments/stationery \(‘one stop shop’\)  
• Post office \(or incorporated in ‘one stop shop’\)

• Compliance with Sport England/Northern Ireland/Scotland/Wales  
competition standards.  
# Universities 41-11  
Refer to Chapter 37 for detailed planning and design guidelines for  
sports and recreation facilities.  
# 2.22 Academic offices  
The provision of academic office accommodation is a sensitive topic  
in many universities. Individual academic offices were originally  
provided on the assumption that they would be used for private study,  
conducting tutorials with two to four students, small staff meetings  
and for receiving professional visitors. As such, the academic office  
is a complex environment used for a number of different settings.  
*Individual or shared offices*  
In many universities, the need for all academic staff to have their  
own office is viewed as an important aspect of academic life.  
However, some universities consider that the offices are too large  
for one member of staff and as a result, the individual offices are  
being replaced with larger shared offices, supported by an appropri-  
ate number of small group rooms for meetings and tutorials. This  
arrangement may be particularly appropriate for those staff with  
high class contact hours, those regularly conducting visits to stu-  
dents on work placements, those in professional practice, or those  
involved in specialist facility-based research work, and as a result  
do not spend many hours in an office. Other facilities required  
to support the ‘shared office’ approach might include a common  
room, kitchenette, reception area with secretarial staff, printing and  
general reprographic stations with recycling facilities, and other  
support service facilities.  
*A balanced approach*  
A model of provision promoted by one university and accepted by  
staff involved a compromise between individual and shared offices  
for full time staff\: 25 per cent of the offices were allocated for indi-  
vidual academic staff \(Dean 20 m2, HOD 15 m2, other 10 m2\) with  
the remaining 75 per cent allocated to shared offices split equally  
between offices for two academic staff \(16 m2\) and offices for four  
academic staff \(32 m2\). The faculty could decide how to allocate  
their offices to academic staff. A set of small, bookable rooms were  
provided for tutorials, meetings, etc. Open plan shared ‘hot-desk-  
ing’ offices were provided for part-time staff \(4 m2/50 per cent of  
part-time staff\).  
# 2.24 Administrative offices  
Demand for administrative space in HE is expanding, reflecting  
the growth in certain areas of work such as quality assurance,  
marketing, central fundraising and widening participation work,  
along with services in established areas such as finance, research  
administration and student support. A typical list of university  
administration and central departments includes\:  
• University management  
• Finance  
• Human resources  
• Marketing  
• Quality assurance  
• Business development  
• IT systems support  
• Registry, admissions and exams  
• Student and academic services  
• Estates and facilities.  
New buildings offer the opportunity to co-locate administrative  
departments, improving efficiency, enhancing student/staff ser-  
vices and saving space. Space savings can be achieved by arranging  
administrative departments in suites of large, open plan offices  
with small-embedded offices or ‘pods’ for privacy, confidentiality  
or breakout time. Creatively designed open plan offices can provide  
flexibility, as well as a conducive and effective environment for  
team working, interaction and communication. **41-12 Universities**  
# 2.25 Operational requirements  
The briefing process should capture both the functional and oper-  
ational requirements of the project. A checklist of operational  
requirements in the bullet points that follow is a guide for discussion  
with the university. Each department should provide a summary of  
the current arrangements and proposed future requirements.

# 2.26 The virtual campus  
The concept of a virtual campus refers to a specific format of dis-  
tance education and online learning in which students, teaching  
staff and even university administrative and technical staff mainly  
‘meet’ or communicate through technical links. A virtual campus  
can also refer to the online offerings of a university where course  
work is completed either partially or wholly online, often with  
assistance from a tutor, teacher or teaching assistant. Although the  
phrase ‘virtual campus’ is an important concept in education, there  
is no theoretical framework for it. There is no consensus over the  
optimum concept for e-learning and the rapid development of tech-  
nologies is continually changing the landscape.  
*e-university*  
In 2003, the e-university was launched as a single vehicle of  
UK universities’ HE programmes over the internet. Following  
its launch, it attracted just 900 students against a target of 5600.  
In effect, it failed and Higher Education Funding Council for  
England \(HEFCE\) decided to switch to support the development  
of e-learning in universities that provided coherent progress.  
However, it is expected that e-learning will increase in popularity  
as a response to improvements in the learning interface and high  
fee levels.  
*Embedded e-learning*  
The failure of the e-university has impacted on e-learning and  
shown the importance of holding a narrowly skewed focus or  
definition of e-learning. A learner-centred approach not a technol-  
ogy-driven approach is now considered the way forward. This is  
known as ‘embedded e-learning’.  
*Information communications technology*  
Technologies used in learning, such as interactive whiteboards,  
personal learning environments, wireless networks and mobile  
devices, plus the internet and high quality digital learning  
resources, and the ability to access many of these from home  
and the workplace, are altering the experience and aspirations of  
learners.  
*Mobile and wireless technologies*  
Mobile and wireless technologies have increasingly widespread  
use in HE and the current trend is towards planning innovative  
methods in which to incorporate these technologies into e-learning.  
Key benefits in their use are seen as\:  
• Portability and anytime, anyplace connectivity  
• Flexibility and timeless access to e-learning resources  
• Immediacy of communication  
• Empowerment and engagement of learners  
• Active learning experiences. *Mobile and wireless learning*  
‘Mobile and wireless learning’ is an adopted term for the broad  
concept involving many of the same technologies and facilities as  
e-learning, but with access via mobile devices or wireless networks  
rather than cable networks. Mobile and wireless devices have sup-  
ported presentational, interactive and creative forms of learning,  
and when combined with e-learning, multi-media opportunities  
have resulted. Current best practice has been with the most well-  
known technologies\: USB storage devices, PDAs, laptops, tablet  
PCs, mobile phones and electronic voting. The reason for adoption  
of these is\:  
• Wider availability  
• Ability to support a range of functions  
• Desktop functionality  
• Ease of use  
• Acceptance by learners  
• Potential to support pedagogical aims.  
The easier the mobile device can become the property of the learner,  
the more it is used. However, provision needs to be made for equip-  
ment booking, battery charging, induction and IT support systems.  
*Online exams and assessments*  
Technology is also being used for regulated online computer-as-  
sisted assessments and exams replacing paper-based methods at  
many universities. This is proving very successful with students.  
It will require supervised and controlled environments within the  
university in the form of dedicated secure rooms.  
*Campus-based e-learning*  
As mentioned earlier, across the sector the general expectation  
is that e-learning at a distance will not wholly supplant face-to-  
face teaching. However, campus-based e-learning will continue  
to develop and allow students to work more flexibly, on and off  
campus. At any one time, students will be able to work elsewhere  
on their projects, using their laptops or mobile devices linked to the  
campus wireless network.  
*Distance learning*  
Distance learning, sometimes called e-learning, is a teaching and  
learning system designed to be carried out remotely using elec-  
tronic communication. It offers opportunities in situations where  
traditional education has difficulty in operating. It is more flexi-  
ble in time and can be delivered anywhere. Popular technologies  
are CDs, MP3, web-casts, DVDs, video conferencing and inter-  
net. There is student-teacher interaction with feedback. The Open  
University, other universities and distance learning centres spe-  
cialise in supplying distance learning courses, home study courses,  
online training and courses in a variety of subjects to gain nation-  
ally recognised qualifications.  
*Distributed learning*  
Distributed learning, also called IT-mediated instruction, is an  
instructional model that involves using various information tech-  
nologies to help students learn. It encompasses technologies such  
as video or audio conferencing, satellite broadcasting and web-  
based multi-media formats. It can be implemented in various forms  
and scales, for example\:  
• Course enhancement – instructional technologies embedded in  
traditional classroom settings can be made available for students  
to consult before or after class sessions via the website making  
learning less dependent on time and location  
• Hybrid delivery – a web-based multi-media lecture made avail-  
able to students to view online before attending a class session,  
and also made available for use in other courses multiplying  
their usefulness  
# Universities 41-13  
• Virtual classroom – ‘any time, any place, at any pace’ of learning.  
A course can be packaged on a CD-ROM, including prerequisite  
online lectures and the PowerPoint presentations coupled with  
audio for distance learners.  
# 2.26 Other modes of learning  
*Work-based learning*  
Workplace-based learning is expected to increase although the  
expectation is that it will remain a minor aspect of HE activity.  
Some institutions are likely to become more involved in this work,  
particularly at foundation degree level and with tailor-made mas-  
ters’ courses delivered on organisations’ premises. There will be a  
saving on teaching space, but not support space.  
*Partnerships*  
In some fields, notably creative arts, staff and students are becom-  
ing more itinerant, using cities’ cultural infrastructures and  
practitioner workplaces. Partnership arrangements of this kind are  
often involved and unlikely to lead to a saving on teaching space.  
# 3 SPACE PLANNING  
Environmental, economic and social issues form an integral part of  
the decision process in planning new educational facilities.  
# 3.1 Key issues  
The following are some key approaches to consider when planning  
new educational facilities\:  
• Adopt a modular planning system that is clear and simple to  
use; that has the ability to maximise a range of alternative plans  
needed by the university; and that will meet the objectives of  
functionality, cost effectiveness and adaptability. Modular sys-  
tems can offer practical and economic advantages during design,  
construction and throughout the life of a building  
• Distinguish between those parts of the building that will be fixed  
or unchanging, such as the structure, primary circulation and  
services cores; and those parts that need to be flexible or allow  
change, such as teaching spaces, local servicing systems, inter-  
nal partitions, flooring and ceiling systems  
• Use non-cellular construction techniques, incorporate large span  
framed structures where appropriate, and create column-free  
flexible space  
• Plan space in terms of broad categories of use, with provision  
not only suitable for its briefed purpose, but which is also easily  
adaptable  
• Make greater use of general purpose teaching space; adopt  
appropriate ranges of room sizes; and use partitions between  
rooms that can be moved without major disruption  
• Locate general teaching rooms in a common pool for timetabling  
and sharing between departments/schools  
• Locate accommodation used by large numbers of students at the  
lower levels of a building; and locate accommodation that is to  
be used by smaller numbers of students at upper levels  
• Organise accommodation such that discrete academic depart-  
ments can expand and contract without major adaptation;  
boundaries between departments should be flexible.  
# 3.2 Sustainability  
Applying sustainable solutions where appropriate to education  
projects that reduce environmental impact is an important consid-  
eration. Some of the issues to be considered are\:  
• Zoning of space to minimise mechanical and cooling require-  
ments  
• Creation of open plan, flexible and adaptable environments to  
reduce churn **41-14 Universities**  
• Façades that significantly reduce incident solar gains, moderate  
external noise, provide opportunities for natural ventilation, and  
allow user control to provide satisfactory comfort conditions  
• Façade U-values that exceed building regulations  
• Material specifications that select recycled materials and prod-  
ucts from sustainable sources  
• Robust materials requiring low maintenance  
• Low energy artificial lighting and controls, via presence detec-  
tors and daylight linking, to maximise the use of daylight and  
provide a visually comfortable space  
• Low energy cooling and mechanical ventilation systems, via dis-  
placement air systems, with heat recovery to reduce energy use  
• Low maintenance requirements during the operational life of  
systems  
• Introducing measures to reduce water use such as dual flush  
WCs, low-pressure water systems and aerating taps  
• Rainwater recycling to reduce consumption of potable water  
• Integrating photovoltaic arrays to reduce energy consumption  
• Providing cycle and subsidised public transport networks to dis-  
courage private vehicle use and reduce carbon emissions  
• Using local suppliers and contractors to support local economy  
and minimise carbon emission  
• Using fuel cell powered site vehicles.  
# 3.3 Space norms  
Space norms used to be published by the University Grants  
Committee \(UGC\) and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding  
Council \(PCFC\). They were based on observations and assumptions  
about how students in different disciplines were taught – number  
of hours, type of teaching activity, staff/student ratio and area per  
workplace. They were widely used by institutions and the UK HE  
Funding Councils to inform the size of new building projects, but  
there have been no new or updated norms published for decades.  
Although there has been a shift away from using space norms,  
many institutes still use them as a guide for space weightings often  
with modifications.  
*UGC space norms*  
UGC space norms were expressed as an ‘allowance’ of net usable  
area per full-time equivalent \(FTE\) student for ‘departmental aca-  
demic areas’. The allowance comprised the following space types\:  
• General teaching space \(excluding lecture theatres\)  
• Academic offices and research labs  
• Non-academic offices and stores  
• Teaching and PG research labs  
• Lab ancillaries.  
There were also space norms for ‘non-departmental academic  
areas’ expressed as an ‘allowance’ of net usable area per FTE stu-  
dent for the following space types\:  
• Lecture theatres  
• Library  
• Administration \(including maintenance\)  
• Social, dining, health centres  
• Sports facilities \(building\) – indoor and outdoor.  
The norm varied according to academic discipline and was a  
guide to quantifying overall space requirements as a basis for pro-  
ject briefs. The UK HE Space Management Group \(SMG\) updated  
UGC norms in 2006. These are listed in Table I.  
*PCFC space norms*  
The PCFC introduced a new system of space norms for PCFC  
institutions \(Polytechnics and Colleges\) in 1990 with reduced  
area allowances to reflect the practice at the time. The norms were  
around 15 per cent less than previously used methods of calculation  
and included the following\:  
• Specialist and non-specialist areas  
• General teaching spaces  
• Libraries  
• Staff, administration  
• Sports and catering facilities.  
The SMG updated PCFC norms in 2006. These are listed in  
Table II.

# 3.4 Space standards  
‘Space standards’ are area guidelines per workplace \(student  
or staff\) for the various types of activity or accommodation  
such as general teaching rooms, offices, laboratories, libraries,  
etc. They should be regarded as an overall check against func-  
tionality and will need adjustment in many situations to suit  
the specific needs of the activity carried out and the occupation  
levels. Both UGC and PCFC used a series of space standards  
for given activities or accommodation. These are listed in  
Table III.  
Many institutions have adopted their own indicative space  
standards, which vary from the UGC/PCFC guidelines. These are  
listed in Table IV. **Table III UGC and PCFC Space Standards \(net usable m2/workplace\)**

# 3.5 Area definitions  
Five definitions of floor area are used in construction projects in  
higher educational institutions, Figure 41.4. It is imperative that  
any area stated is qualified as being one of the following five  
definitions\:  
*Gross external area – for planning applications*\: the area of  
the building measured externally at each floor level, including  
all spaces within the building, and perimeter wall thicknesses,  
external projections, loading bays and garages. It excludes open  
balconies, canopies and roof terraces.

*Gross internal area – for building costs estimation*\: the area of a  
building measured to the internal face of the perimeter walls at  
each floor level. It includes all spaces within the building, inter-  
nal structure, walls and partitions, loading bays and garages. It  
excludes voids over atria.  
*Net internal area – equivalent of net lettable area*\: the area within  
a building that comprises usable areas \(including built-in fixtures  
that occupy usable space\) and primary horizontal circulation. It  
excludes common entrance halls, atria, landings and balconies,  
toilets, bathrooms, cleaners’ rooms, plant spaces \(rooms, ducts  
and stores\), vertical circulation, internal structure \(walls, col-  
umns, piers, etc.\), loading bays and garages.  
*Net usable area – area available in rooms for people to use*\: the  
area within a building available for people to use. It excludes  
primary horizontal circulation in addition to all of the aforemen-  
tioned.  
*Balance area – area to enable the building to function*\: the floor  
area planned to enable the building to function. It includes pri-  
mary horizontal and vertical circulation, entrance lobbies, atria,  
foyers, lifts, toilets, cloakrooms, cleaners’ rooms and stores,  
plant spaces \(rooms, ducts, stores\), loading bays and garages,  
internal structure \(wall, columns, piers, etc.\).  
However, it should be noted that definition conventions may  
change in the future with the wider introduction of the International  
Property Measurement Standards \(see Chapter 5, Section 4.3\).  
*Gross Floor Space \(GIA\) area breakdown*  
Guidance now recommends that new-build projects should target  
the following GIA floor space area breakdown\:  
• Net usable area 70 per cent  
• Balance area 30 per cent  
• Total \(GIA\) 100 per cent.  
# 4 BRIEFING  
# 4.1 The brief  
In its broadest sense, the brief is a ‘model’ of the functional com-  
ponents of an organisation that needs to be accommodated in the  
design proposals. It needs to identify the qualitative and quanti-  
tative aspects of the client’s requirements that are essential to the  
project.  
However, the successful outcome of a project will depend upon  
the design team gaining a comprehensive understanding of the  
client’s values, ethos, aspirations and objectives; all stakeholder  
functional requirements; and the wider project parameters. This  
understanding can only be established by implementing a thorough  
and methodical briefing process. **41-16 Universities**  
**41.4** *Diagram illustrating area definitions\: RICS Code of measuring practice \(6th ed.\)*  
The following points are true of a ‘good’ brief\:  
• The more comprehensive the guidance, and the more certain the  
criteria identified in the brief, the greater is the probability that  
the design solution will provide an appropriate and satisfactory  
framework for the client  
• Each stage of briefing must establish criteria that are salient to  
the progress of the design to a higher level of certainty and detail  
• A brief must precede design, but the sequence of events and  
interaction between briefing and design must accommodate  
widely varying preferences, working methods and levels of  
expertise in different user groups and clients.  
# 4.2 Briefing stages  
Briefing is an iterative process and an integral part of design. It  
takes place in clearly defined stages that establish approved guid-  
ance and criteria for the corresponding design stage. The various  
stages are shown in the following\:  
• Strategic brief\: strategic plan, master plan, feasibility study  
• Concept brief\: concept design, preliminary design  
• Scheme brief\: scheme design, final design  
• Detail brief\: detail design, production information.  
A preliminary version of each brief – strategic, concept, scheme  
or detail – should be approved before work is started on the corre-  
sponding design stage.  
# 4.3 Briefing process  
Briefing requires the full engagement of a client. The stages in the  
process are summarised in what follows and in Figure 41.5.  
*Project sponsor and project steering group*  
• At the outset, it is essential that a ‘project sponsor’ from within  
the university be identified to ‘champion’ the project  
• Under the direction of the project sponsor, a project steering  
group comprising key university personnel should be established  
to represent the views of all ‘user groups’ and ‘stakeholders’  
involved in the project.  
*Vision statement and background*  
• A vision statement identifying the aims and objectives of the  
project should be prepared by the university and presented by  
the project sponsor  
• Alongside the vision statement, a basic statement of need and  
the operational and delivery requirements of the project should  
be provided  
• All relevant background information and any documentation of  
previous work undertaken, that may assist in the briefing pro-  
cess, should be made available.  
*Interview meetings*  
• The project sponsor or steering group should identify key per-  
sonnel within the university to be interviewed in the first step of  
collecting data to develop the project brief  
• In advance of the meetings, all interviewees should prepare an  
outline statement of need and complete a questionnaire pro-  
forma, prepared by the briefing team, which will seek to obtain  
essential data sufficient to inform preliminary space planning  
• During the interview process, all existing accommodation should  
be visited and assessed as to whether it meets the functional and  
operational requirements of each user group.  
*Data analysis*  
• Data gathered at the interview meetings should be analysed and  
collated to form the basis of the preliminary space need, space  
relationships and space modelling options.  
*Benchmarking*  
• Benchmarking is an invaluable activity that should be under-  
taken in the early stages of briefing. Together with the client,  
appropriate projects should be identified and visited to show var-  
ying design solutions that are relevant to the project  
• To manage client expectations, it is essential that the budget for  
all benchmark visits is declared and fully understood  
• The benefits of benchmarking are far-reaching, as it takes stake-  
holders out of an everyday environment to unfamiliar places  
where previously unconsidered possibilities and solutions can be  
witnessed first-hand  
• In the absence of any space standards provided by the university,  
a review of the HEFCE/DELNI/SFC/HEFCW space planning  
and design guidelines could be undertaken \(even though these  
have not been updated for some years\).  
*Preliminary briefing document*  
• A complete record of all briefing meetings, the vision state-  
ment, functional and operational requirements, structure charts,  
population schedules, accommodation schedules \(assuming **Universities 41-17**  
**41.5** *Briefing process diagram*  
shared/non-shared facilities\), preliminary activity space data,  
significant/desirable functional relationships and process flow  
diagrams, should be incorporated into a preliminary briefing  
document for review and discussion with the project steering  
group, and for approval by the project sponsor.  
*Briefing development*  
• Following approval of the preliminary briefing document, design  
concept options can be developed for review with the project  
sponsor and project steering group  
• The concept options should be tested against the preliminary  
brief to determine the most appropriate or preferred option for  
the project  
• The briefing process should continue in parallel with the design  
process and further meetings held with staff, as required, to  
develop detailed schedules of accommodation and room data  
sheets  
• All data collected should be incorporated into subsequent brief-  
ing documents for discussion with the project steering group and  
for client comment and approval.

Radians are principally used in purely mathematical situations.  
In practice, degrees and its subdivisions are normally used  
in the UK. The symbol °,´ and ´´ are exceptions in that there  
is no space between the value and the symbol. Decimal  
subdivisions of the degree are preferred to minutes and  
seconds; this facilitates the using of pocket calculators. On  
continental Europe, the grade \(or its alternative name, the  
gon\) is often used, always decimally subdivided.  
The statute mile is currently intended to stay for the  
moment on road signs in the UK  
1 mile = 1.609 344 km exactly.  
On road signs the mile is confusingly abbreviated m, ml  
is preferred.  
The square foot is still used by commercial estate agents  
in the UK  
1 sq ft = 0.092 290 304 m2 exactly. The acre is also  
commonly found in the UK  
1 acre = 0.404 685 6422 ha exactly  
The abbreviations l and L may each be used for litre;  
the full name is often used to avoid confusion. The  
imperial pint \(pt\) has been approved for continuing use  
in the UK, but only for draught beer and for milk in  
bottles \(not cartons!\). 1 pt = 0.568 2451
