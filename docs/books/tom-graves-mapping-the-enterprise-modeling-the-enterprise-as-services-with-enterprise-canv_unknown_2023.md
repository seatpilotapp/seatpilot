xiii Introduction  
How can we describe the enterprise? More specifically, how do we  
describe what happens there, how, when, where, why, by whom,  
with what?  
For architects and others tasked with creating conversations and  
connections across the enterprise, these are not trivial questions\: they  
strike right to the core of the work that we do. The usual answer is  
‘models’ – data-sets, drawings, diagrams – that illustrate specific aspects  
of the respective issues. But the catch is that there are so many different  
model-types in use in enterprise-architectures and elsewhere, all different,  
all applying at different levels, all applying only to specific subsets of the  
context, and all with weak connection at best to any other type of model.  
It’s a huge problem – though one that’s not easy to see until we try to link  
everything together across the whole of the enterprise.  
Hence the Enterprise Canvas\: a new model-template and checklist for  
service-design that can be used to describe just about anything in any part  
and at any level of the enterprise, and that also acts as a consistent frame  
for all the other types of models that we need in our architectures.  
The Canvas can take several different forms, such in the example  
shown in Figure I-1, but the same basic frame provides a consistent anchor  
in how to view everything else in the enterprise. It doesn’t really replace  
any other model\: but within that frame, all those other models start to  
work together, and start to make practical sense.  
That’s the role of the Enterprise Canvas\: not “one model to rule  
them all”, perhaps, but “one model to bind them”. Consistency at last;  
consistency that makes sense; that’s the aim here. Interested?

#  Who should read this book?  
The book is intended for enterprise architects, business-architects,  
IT-­ architects, process-designers, service-designers and others who deal  
with the practical implications of whole-of-enterprise issues.  
It should also be useful for strategists and service-managers, and  
for anyone else who works with other enterprise-wide themes such  
as supply-chains, value-webs, quality, security, knowledge-sharing,  
sustainability, business ethics and social responsibility, or health, safety  
and environment.  
#  What’s in this book?  
The text is divided into two main sections\:  
•  
•  
a step-by-step introduction to each of the components  
in the Enterprise Canvas model, and their function and  
use in modelling the overall enterprise  
a variety of patterns, practical examples and business  
usages for the model and its associated tools and  
techniques  
xvi IntroduCTIon  
Each chapter builds on the previous descriptions, introduces another  
core concept or component for Enterprise Canvas, and provides a set  
of ideas and methods to apply straight away in your day-to-day work.  
Although there’s a fair amount of theory behind the Canvas, the emphasis  
is always on practice – something that you can use – so each chapter  
includes examples and stories to place the ideas into a real-life context.  
Most chapters also include an Into Practice section, with sets of questions  
to help you apply the material within your own context.  
There’s also a set of appendices at the end of the book, providing  
a visual-summary, additional notes on converting to and from the  
popular Business Model Canvas, notes on using the Enterprise Canvas in  
computer-based modelling-tools and as a service-viability checklist, and  
pointers to other sources for further information.  
But what is the Enterprise Canvas, anyway? Let’s start with a brief  
overview.  
xvii CHAPTER 1  
# What Is the Enterprise  
# Canvas?  
The Enterprise Canvas is a quick, easy way to describe just about anything  
in an enterprise. It’s a visual checklist that’s simple enough to scribble  
on the back of a napkin, yet it can also carry enough detail to link in with  
formal modeling tools for project management, system design, strategy  
simulation, and the rest.  
The role of Enterprise Canvas is that it’s a way to support conversations  
about ensuring that everything connects together properly across the  
whole enterprise. And the reason we’d want to do that would be to support  
better effectiveness across the enterprise, because things work better when  
they work together, on purpose.  
The way we do that with Enterprise Canvas is to describe everything in  
the enterprise in terms of services – that everything in the enterprise either  
is, represents, or implies a service. We’ll explore that idea in more detail in  
Chapter 2, “The Nature of Service.”  
A key part of the value of Enterprise Canvas is that it’s context neutral\: it  
works the same way with every type of content or context, at every scope and  
scale, for every level of the organization from big-picture strategy to frontline  
operations, and with every stage of the change process from initial idea to  
design, implementation, and deployment. It also works with every type of  
enterprise and organization and the connections to market and more. We’ll  
go into more detail on that in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market.”

1 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
The worked example we’ll use throughout this book is a fictitious  
shoe manufacturer and retailer called Las Zapaterias de México – usually  
abbreviated to ZapaMex. For our purposes here, we assume that they are  
currently selling only to physical shoe-shops in the local market, but they  
also want to start selling online and to expand out elsewhere into Latin  
America over the next few years.  
A colleague and I invented the imaginary ZapaMex company a few  
years ago while we were working together on enterprise-  
scale issues for several banks in Guatemala and Mexico. It was hard  
to get them to focus on anything other than their IT and information  
flows, so we realized we needed a nonbank example to illustrate  
some of the broader aspects of services, particularly those about  
people and about physical equipment and the like. We'll see more on  
that later on in this book, particularly in Chapter 6, “Service Actors  
and Other Entities”; Chapter 7, “Service Roles and Relationships”;  
Chapter 9, “Service Flows”; and Chapter 13, “Service Content.”  
As mentioned above, we can use Enterprise Canvas in either a back-of-  
the-napkin sketch format or in a more formal style for use in Powerpoint or  
modeling tools. We’ll do a quick overview of both of those styles here. But  
it’s probably easier to understand what’s going on in services, and how the  
Canvas represents that, if we start first with the sketch format.  
#  On the Back of a Napkin  
Imagine that you’re in a cafe with some colleagues, or in a breakout room  
at the office, and you want to describe some service that you need to  
analyze or to build. You have a notepad on the cafe table or a whiteboard  
in front of you. Pen in hand, you’re about to start drawing, and the thought  
2 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
comes to you\: What is a service? How do services really work? What do  
they actually do? What’s the relationship between services and products –  
and in what ways are they different, anyway? So let’s look at how we can  
describe all of this in sketch format with the Enterprise Canvas – though  
there are a couple of things that we need to explore first before we  
get there.  
To start, we go all the way back to absolute first principles for services  
and service design. The service always exists in the context of a shared  
enterprise, and we assert that there’s always one key idea that in effect  
defines that enterprise. Everything that happens in the enterprise revolves  
around this one overarching idea or “vision,” which in turn tells us the values  
that guide that shared enterprise. \(We’ll see more on this in Chapter 2,  
“The Nature of Service,” and explore how to define an enterprise vision in  
Chapter 4, “Service Vision and Values.”\) For example, everyone involved  
in the shared enterprise that ZapaMex belongs to will connect in their own  
way with an enterprise vision of “make your feet healthy and happy.” This  
single idea defines what that enterprise is\: everything else is some means  
to help make that vision happen and share it among the players in the  
enterprise.  
Everything that happens in the enterprise is driven in some way by the  
tension between what we currently have – the “realized ends” – and what  
we strive toward, the “desired ends,” represented by the vision. As shown in  
Figure 1-1, we show that tension as a vertical arrow between what we have  
now and the vision that we reach toward.  
3 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Figure 1-1. Serving the enterprise vision  
In turn, everything in the enterprise is a service that contributes toward  
that vision. \(Or it should do – hence, the need for conversations, to find  
out what’s going on at each point and what we could do to make it more  
effective at contributing toward the vision.\)  
The purpose of a service is that it serves something\: it adds value. We  
bring in something from elsewhere in the shared enterprise; we create or  
add value; and we pass it on to some other player in the enterprise, often in  
the form of a product. \(Products exist only between services and connect  
services together\: we’ll see more on this in Chapter 9, “Service Flows.”\)  
This flow of value around the enterprise is a supply chain, a value  
chain, and a value web\: the name we use doesn’t matter that much, but  
what does matter is this flow of value. In our back-of-the-napkin sketch, as  
shown in Figure 1-2, we can show this flow as a horizontal line, connecting  
to the vision via the service.  
4 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Figure 1-2. Each service connects the value web to the vision  
That gives us the simplest version of the Enterprise Canvas, with the  
service as a means to add value to the overall enterprise, at an intersection  
of value and values. That simple sketch would be enough to identify what  
the service is and does and guide an initial conversation with service  
stakeholders.  
For example, we might ask about what’s moving around in this value  
web, or about who else is involved in the value flow. The questions we  
could ask at this stage might include\:  
•  
Who are the suppliers for this service – its providers?  
What services do they provide, and in what form?  
•  
Who are the customers for this service – its clients? What  
services do they consume, and in what form?  
•  
What connection do those suppliers and customers  
each have with the desired ends – the vision – for this  
overall service?  
•  
And what relationships does this service have with each  
of its suppliers and customers?  
5 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Given the answers to questions such as these, we might add to the  
sketch diagram a supplier-side and a customer-side, to document what  
comes in, what goes out, what is shared with whom, and the reasons and  
choices for that flow of value. The sketch would then look something like  
that shown in Figure 1-3.  
Figure 1-3. Service, suppliers, and customers  
As we’ll see later, it’s useful to split each flow into and out of our  
services into three distinct phases\: what happens before, during, and after  
the main transactions of a service. As shown in Figure 1-4, this gives us a  
simple pattern for our sketch diagram that can help us gather more detail  
about the service flows.  
6 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Figure 1-4. Flows before, during, and after transactions  
We might ask our stakeholders some further questions to elicit a bit  
more detail about the structure and operation of the service itself. For this,  
we would expand our view of the service to add another dimension\: the  
core of the service itself and the parts that face either toward suppliers or  
toward customers. As shown in Figure 1-5, this gives us a kind of three-  
by-­ three pattern, with each of the cells representing a smaller service that  
serves the respective needs and flows for that part of the overall service.  
Figure 1-5. Service, suppliers, customers, and flows  
7 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
We could ask further questions about what guides this service\:  
•  
Who or what will support coordination of this service  
with others in the same organization, or value web, or  
the overall shared enterprise?  
•  
Who or what takes responsibility for direction of the  
service and for mapping out the future of this service?  
•  
And who or what will support validation of the service,  
help to keep it on track to the vision and values of the  
broader shared enterprise?  
As shown in Figure 1-6, we can add placeholders for each of these on  
our sketch diagram, where we can link our stakeholders’ answers for the  
service that’s currently in focus on the Canvas.  
Figure 1-6. Service and its guidance services  
And we could also ask\:  
•  
Who or what is an investor in this service, to get things  
started?  
•  
Who or what extracts value from the overall flow, as a  
beneficiary of the service, rather than a customer?  
8 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Again, as shown in Figure 1-7, we can add placeholders on our sketch  
diagram for the answers to those questions.  
Figure 1-7. Service investors and beneficiaries  
We can mix-and-match between all these various views and add-ons  
as we need. The same Canvas – and the same service in focus – could be  
shown as anything from a simple cross, as we saw back in Figure 1-2, to an  
all-the-extras “kitchen sink” view as shown in Figure 1-8, depending on the  
amount of detail that we need in our back-of-the-napkin scrawl.  
Figure 1-8. “Kitchen sink” back-of-the-napkin Canvas \(service\)  
9 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
And we then can link in any other models we might want, too\: for  
example, that might include a Zachman matrix or Porter Five Forces or a  
SWOT or a BPMN process model. The Canvas provides a frame that can link  
them all together and help them to make more sense as a unified whole.  
#  Going Formal  
Going beyond the sketch diagram, we can also make it more formal – the  
kind of boxes-and-lines diagram that we would show on a Powerpoint  
slide rather than the back of a napkin. As shown in Figure 1-9, the simplest  
version is a depiction of the service on its own, as a means to act on the  
value flow in alignment with the desired aims of the overall enterprise.  
Figure 1-9. Formal version\: the service in focus  
More often, we would add a bit more detail about the service by  
splitting it into that three-by-three grid\: inbound \(supplier-side\); this \(this  
service\); outbound \(customer-side\); and before \(future\), during \(present\),  
and after \(past\) the main transaction. As shown in Figure 1-10, there are  
default labels for each of the resultant nine cells, but we can use any other  
appropriate label if we wish – which would usually be the case if we’re  
modeling the real services of an enterprise.  
10 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Figure 1-10. Formal version\: standard nine-cell grid  
As with that back-of-the-napkin sketch, we might add further detail  
about other services that connect with this service and about the flows that  
make up the value web between all these services, as shown in Figure 1-11.  
Figure 1-11. Formal version\: supplier, customer, and value web  
And as shown in Figure 1-12, we might also want to add the investors  
and beneficiaries, or links to the various guidance services.  
11 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
Figure 1-12. guidance  
Complete formal version\: investors, beneficiaries,  
We can use any or all of these variations to describe any type of service,  
at any level of abstraction, anywhere in the enterprise\: whichever way we  
portray it, it’s all the same simple model.  
Simple, yet powerful. And easy to use in practice, in real everyday  
business conversations with business stakeholders. That’s what the  
Enterprise Canvas is for\: keeping it simple, keeping it real.  
#  Into Practice  
Imagine that you’re an enterprise architect, a service designer, or in a  
similar role, tasked with leading a major business transformation. You  
need your senior stakeholders to understand that this transformation must  
12 ChapTER 1 WhAT Is the EnTERpRISE CanvAS?  
connect everything together across the whole enterprise and that you and  
they will need a consistent way to describe this, to get everyone on board.  
Use the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help you guide  
that conversation\:  
•  
What models and model types do you use in your work  
on service design and the like? To what domains and  
levels of abstraction does each of those models apply?  
•  
How and why do you link the various models together?  
If you can’t link the models together, what difficulties  
does this present in practice?  
•  
Do you develop or work with business models? If so,  
in what ways do you need to extend that model to  
broaden its scope, or to link it to other types of models?  
How do you implement a business model in practice?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we’ve seen a brief overview of the Enterprise Canvas model,  
both in its sketch-diagram form and in the more formal structure that  
would be used in presentations and modeling tools.  
In the next chapter, we’ll explore more detail about the core ideas  
behind the Enterprise Canvas model and how it can be used to describe  
almost everything that happens in an enterprise.  
13 CHAPTER 2  
# The Nature of Service  
Within any organization, we need to keep track of how everything  
connects with everything else, all the way up to the big-picture view, all the  
way down to everyday process and practice, and all the way across every  
aspect of the enterprise, end-to-end through all of the different silos and  
business domains. One picture of the enterprise, as a whole, in all of its  
richness, all of its complexity, all of its detail, all of it changing dynamically  
over time – yet also all of it easy for anyone to understand.  
That’s the requirement\: yet up until now, it’s often seemed an  
impossible challenge. There’s been no straightforward means to cover the  
whole of that range, in any consistent way, or even at all; at one end of that  
spectrum, we can lose our way in the clouds, while at the other end there’s  
a real danger of drowning in all of the detail. Each type of model or method  
will be optimized to describe just one part of the puzzle, so we end up  
trying to translate from one model to another, jumping back and forth from  
abstract to concrete – and there’s a lot that can get lost in the translation.  
There’s an almost desperate need for consistency here.  
Yet there is one way to make it all work\: assert that everything is a  
service, then build the models outward from there. And that’s where the  
Enterprise Canvas comes into the story. As we’ll see later, there’s a lot of  
richness and nuances to Enterprise Canvas, which is why and how we  
can use it to model almost everything in the enterprise. Yet at its core, it’s  
actually very simple – and its real power comes from that simplicity, in  
how it links together a handful of key ideas\:

15 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
•  
The enterprise exists to create and share value –  
in whatever way “value” may be defined in that  
enterprise.  
•  
An enterprise is a dynamic structure – a “value  
network” – in which value is continually created,  
transformed, and transferred in a continuous process  
of flow and change.  
•  
Everything in the enterprise is or delivers a service  
of some kind that adds value to the enterprise, and  
that passes value on to other services in the overall  
enterprise.  
•  
The enterprise consists of services that connect with  
and support each other in creating value for that  
enterprise.  
For Enterprise Canvas, everything is a service, each helping to  
create value as it flows around the overall enterprise. Products sit between  
services, are inputs and outputs for services; in some cases they’re also  
“proto-services,” perhaps, in that they provide people with part of the  
means to self-deliver a desired service via the use of that product. Each  
of the actors in the enterprise – as suppliers, customers, competitors,  
regulators, or whatever other roles – provides those services to the  
overall enterprise. Even the enterprise itself is a service\: it exists to serve  
a vision of some kind, in accordance with some set of values, even if only  
implied and unacknowledged. So the Enterprise Canvas is a generic map  
to describe any service, anywhere in the enterprise, together with its  
interdependencies and flows.  
To give a bit more detail, to make this more usable in practice, we can  
assert the following\:  
•  
Everything exists within one infinite ecosystem, which  
we might label “the universe” or “the everything.”  
16 •  
•  
•  
•  
Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
For practical reasons, and for sanity’s sake, we’ll usually  
restrict our view to a much smaller subset of that “the  
everything.” We can choose whatever view we like –  
an infinite array of possible sets, all overlapping and  
enclosing and intersecting with each other – though  
we do always need to remember that whatever view we  
choose, it will always be some part of and connected to  
that overall “the everything.”  
One useful option, especially for organizations, is  
to select the subset that describes the part of that  
“the everything” within which the organization  
operates – the organization’s context. This is what we  
call the “enterprise,” or “shared enterprise,” where the  
enterprise itself is a kind of ecosystem bounded by a  
shared purpose, and must always be broader in scope  
than the organization itself. \(We’ll see more on that in  
Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market.”\) As we saw in  
the previous chapter, an enterprise coalesces around  
a single idea or descriptor, usually referred to as the  
“vision” for the enterprise.  
Within that enterprise, we assert that every entity either  
is, represents, or implies a service. Every entity delivers  
services, provides services, consumes other services,  
and passes products between services. The ecosystem –  
the business ecosystem, in this case – is made viable by  
this constant interchange between services.  
This interchange occurs at every level. Everything is a  
service, from whole organizations to the faucet in the  
bathroom or a single line of program code.  
17 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
Everything in the enterprise is a service, provides a service, implies a  
service, can be described in terms of services and flows between services;  
there are no apparent exceptions to this. And every service serves – it  
serves something else, someone else; it serves the unifying “vision” that  
defines the extended enterprise.  
We also note that, over the ecosystem as a whole, all relations are  
symmetrical. Everything is a service; hence, everything is also a “supplier”  
to at least one other service, and a “customer” of at least one or more  
others – otherwise, the service literally has no valid purpose within the  
enterprise as a whole. Within the overall flows of value in the enterprise,  
everyone is both “supplier” and “customer”\: those types of roles arise  
from the relationships between the players rather than from the enterprise  
itself, and increasingly – such as in Agile-development techniques and  
crowdsourcing – the old boundaries between these roles will often become  
blurred. Overall, everything needs to balance out somehow, yet also keep  
creating value for every player. If some of the players set out to “win” by  
trying to make everyone else lose, eventually the enterprise as a whole will  
die – in which case everyone loses.  
Another key theme is about layers of abstraction. At the top-most  
layer, there is only the enterprise itself, and the vision and values that  
define it; at the lowest layer, there are the myriad of activities and details  
where the aims of the enterprise come into contact with the real world.  
Between those two extremes are other distinct layers\: strategy, tactics,  
action plans, and so on. The same patterns of services and relationships  
will recur at each layer – hence, we can use those patterns to describe  
how strategies and tactics will be put into practice, and how ideas and  
experiences from the real world can influence those tactics and strategies.  
There’s a strong underlying emphasis on effectiveness\: finding the  
right dynamic balance between efficiency, reliability, human factors, the  
overall business purpose, and the processes that link all of these together.  
18 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
Finally, some other key points that we’ll also need to consider would  
include\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Service relationships and structures are often fractal  
and recursive, with services clustered together to  
provide broader or more abstract services.  
Affordances – “unexpected services” – arise from the  
ways in which the capabilities that underpin services  
may be reused in or for other services.  
A platform is a cluster of related services used as a base  
for affordance of other services  
What services act on, and deliver, may take many  
forms, including physical “things,” virtual information,  
relational links between people, or an aspirational  
sense of meaning or purpose.  
To make sense of a service, we also need to explore  
themes such as service contract, service policy, service  
level, service guarantee, service status, and service  
completeness.  
Without adequate verification of service completeness,  
a service may fail or deliver a “disservice” or “anti-  
service,” destroying value rather than creating value.  
We’ll see more on all of these themes as we explore the Enterprise  
Canvas in depth.  
#  A Matter of Metaphor  
Two specific metaphors will be of real value here. The first is that of  
enterprise as organism, rather than enterprise as machine.  
19 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
For the past century and more, the dominant organizational metaphor,  
built upon notions of “scientific management,” or “Taylorism,” has been  
that of “organization as machine” – a machine for command and control,  
a predictable machine for making money, and so on. This machine is  
focused on making product\: and being a machine, it has no concept of  
service as such.  
An enterprise, though, is a social construct\: it’s bounded by human  
values and shared commitments. This goes all the way back to the 18th-  
century economist Adam Smith, who described enterprise as “a bold  
endeavor; the animal spirits of the entrepreneur” – emotions and feelings  
that are far beyond the capability of any present-day machine. And while  
it’s hard to get machines to emulate real people, it’s relatively simple to  
force people to emulate machines. Yet so many subtle and maybe essential  
nuances can be lost in that translation that “command and control” is little  
more than an illusion – and one that can be very dangerous indeed to the  
overall enterprise.  
Hence, the value of viewing the enterprise as an organism, a living  
entity in its own right. Where a machine is made up of engineered  
components, a living system consists of services, each interweaving and  
interacting with all the other services in the overall ecosystem.  
An enterprise is defined by shared commitment to a shared vision. The  
purpose of a machine is always extrinsic, defined from outside of itself;  
but for a human enterprise, its purpose is intrinsic, an essential part of its  
definition of itself. Since the enterprise is a social structure rather than a  
machine, this warns us that we can’t actually “engineer” an enterprise\: to  
get it to work to its greatest effectiveness, we have to start with purpose and  
people and build outward from there.  
In line with that metaphor of enterprise-as-organism, the core idea  
behind Enterprise Canvas is that everything can be described in terms of  
services. So while we can perhaps interpret each element and service in  
an Enterprise Canvas model as a kind of component – and this certainly  
20 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
does make more sense as we get closer to real-world action – we do need  
to take care not to fall back into the Taylorist trap of thinking of it only as  
a machine. No matter how machine-like something may seem, it’s still  
delivering a service within a larger “life-like” ecosystem.  
The second metaphor is that of model as holograph, rather than  
model-as-photograph.  
A photograph depicts a scene from a single viewpoint and is usually  
quite easy to decipher. If we cut up a photograph, we’ll have a pile of tiny  
jigsaw-puzzle pieces, each in full detail, yet often with nothing to link those  
pieces together.  
A holograph, as its name suggests, depicts a scene from every possible  
viewpoint, all at once. If we cut up a holograph, each of those fragments  
still depicts the whole scene, though in less detail than the complete  
holograph.  
Most existing model types in business contexts are more like the  
photograph\: they depict one part of the context from a single point of view.  
That’s often essential at the detail level; but if that’s all we have, it’s often  
very hard to link them all together. The usual solution is to try to build  
some kind of frame that describes “life, the universe, everything,” all of it in  
“excruciating detail” \(to quote John Zachman\). But that’s often hopelessly  
impractical, because it could literally take forever – and in the meantime  
the world will have moved on anyway, so the whole approach is doomed to  
failure even before it starts.  
With the Enterprise Canvas, though, each view or module is more  
like a fragment of a holograph. Each view carries its own small collection  
of detail, just like any other conventional model\: but that model is  
always linked to everything else, is always part of a greater whole, in an  
identifiable way.  
In practice, the Canvas is sometimes more of a hybrid, combining  
the advantages of both metaphors – photograph and holograph, detail  
and scope – in ways that still make simple, straightforward, practical  
sense. Yet when we look at the amount of detail that can be carried in a  
21 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
single Enterprise Canvas model, it’s sometimes easy to forget that it is still  
connected to everything else; so it’s useful to remember that holograph  
metaphor, and always keep it in mind while we work.  
#  Into Practice  
For your business-transformation project, you now need your senior  
stakeholders to understand and agree on using an “everything is a service”  
approach, as a way to keep the focus always on overall effectiveness. You  
also want them to understand the importance of using the right metaphors  
to describe any change. Use the ideas in this chapter and the following  
questions to help you guide that conversation.  
#  On Services  
•  
•  
•  
•  
If everything in the enterprise is a service, what or  
whom does each service serve? How would you model  
those relationships of service?  
If everything in the enterprise is a service, how does  
that change your perception of the enterprise itself?  
Whom does the enterprise serve, and why, and how?  
In what other ways could you describe the functioning  
of the whole enterprise? How does each of these views  
change your perception of the enterprise and how it works?  
In your architecture, how do you describe the different  
layers of abstraction – from vision to strategy to tactics  
to operations, and back again? How do you describe  
and govern the various transitions between these layers  
of abstraction? How do you depict the same nominal  
service at different layers of abstraction?  
22 Chapter 2 The Nature of Service  
#  On Metaphor  
•  
•  
•  
In what ways do you describe the enterprise as a  
machine? How is this reflected in everyday language,  
such as “operations,” “functions,” “business units,” and  
the like? What impact does this metaphor have on the  
operation of the enterprise as a whole?  
In what ways do you describe the enterprise as some  
kind of living organism? How is this reflected in  
everyday language, such as “culture,” “health,” “taking  
the pulse,” or even the term “corporation”? What  
impact does this metaphor have on the operation of the  
enterprise as a whole?  
What other metaphors do you use to describe the  
enterprise? How are these reflected in everyday language,  
such as “getting a green light” \(a roads metaphor\), “taking  
a bet” \(finance as gambling\), or “cooking up a new  
project”? What impacts do these metaphors have on the  
operation of the enterprise as a whole?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter, we introduced the core ideas beneath the Enterprise  
Canvas, and in particular, the notion that everything in the enterprise  
can be described as a service – an entity that creates and delivers value in  
terms of a desired aim or “vision” that is shared across the entire extended  
enterprise.  
In the next chapter, we’ll explore more about how to identify the  
context for a service and how the organization’s business models and more  
must connect with that broader context.  
23 CHAPTER 3  
# Service Context  
# and Market  
No service exists in isolation\: it always exists within a context or  
“ecosystem” of other services with which it interacts.  
This occurs at every level, with every service, from an operations-  
layer web service or the services of a customer-service desk or an entire  
organization. It’s simplest, though, to describe this first at the whole-  
organization level.  
To make sense of the relationships between services within the  
overall context, we need a clear distinction between “organization” and  
“enterprise.” Although these two elements can coincide, and many people  
often seem to think they’re one and the same, for enterprise architecture  
and the like we do need to treat them as separate. For our purposes here,  
an organization is an entity that delivers services within an enterprise.  
An organization is bounded by rules, roles, and responsibilities.  
There’s an explicit boundary of protocol and contract, an explicit boundary  
of responsibility for revenue, taxes, legal liability, and so on. \(In this sense,  
an individual person is an organization of one.\) Boundaries are explicit  
and “logical,” and much of the structure and purpose and identity of the  
organization revolves around command and control.

T. Graves, Mapping the Enterprise, https\://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-9836-7\_3  
25 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
An enterprise is bounded by vision, values and \(shared\) commitment.  
The “vision” for an enterprise identifies its emotional drivers, “that which  
gets me out of bed in the morning.” \(An individual is technically an  
intersection point of an almost infinite number of enterprises.\) Boundaries  
are often blurry and “non-rational”; and much of the structure and identity  
and purpose of the enterprise revolves around engagement and trust.  
Or to put it in its simplest terms  
•  
The enterprise is; the organization does.  
•  
The enterprise provides motivation; the organization  
provides action.  
The boundaries of organization and enterprise may sometimes  
coincide – hence, the notion of the organization as “the enterprise.” But  
in effect that’s only a special case, and a potentially dangerous one at  
that, because it can lead us into a kind of narcissistic self-centrism or a  
combative “us versus them” relationship with the business ecosystem.  
\(Mutual interlocking responsibilities are important, too, not just within an  
organization, but also across the shared enterprise – though we’ll see more  
on that later in Chapter 13, “Service Content.”\)  
The enterprise creates the connections that the organization needs  
between itself and its ecosystem\: in enterprise architectures, we’ll usually  
define an architecture for an organization, but about an appropriate  
enterprise in relation to that organization. The same applies to when we  
assess any other kind of service\: our aim is to describe the service \(the  
“organization”\), but we must always do so in context of its ecosystem \(the  
“enterprise”\).  
For most practical purposes, the enterprise that we need in scope  
should be at least two to three steps larger than the boundaries of the  
organization in scope\: first the suppliers and customers in its immediate  
transaction space; then its broader market; and the overall shared  
26 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
enterprise beyond. For example, if we view an IT-service unit as “the  
organization” in its own right, its immediate transaction space would  
be other business units within the parent company, but it needs to be  
aware of potential impacts on the company’s suppliers and customers \(its  
broader “market”\) and the regulators and the like \(the wider ecosystem  
and “shared enterprise” for the company as a whole\).  
#  Service and Market  
To make sense of this, we would typically model the service’s market and  
ecosystem in a series of stages. As shown in Figure 3-1, one place to start  
is with the common self-referential notion of the service itself as both  
“the organization” and its own enterprise, where all meaning and value is  
defined in terms of the organization itself – as in the old railway joke that  
“the trains would run perfectly on time if it wasn’t for the passengers!”  
Figure 3-1. The organization as enterprise  
A disturbing number of organizational units and even of whole  
organizations do tend to think this way – that the world not only revolves  
around them but that it begins and ends with them alone, that there is  
nothing of any value beyond them. A few moments of thought, though,  
would indicate that we can’t make sense of services this way\: a service has  
to serve something. So the next step outward is the basic business model\:  
as shown in Figure 3-2, we receive goods or services from a supplier,  
add some form of value, and deliver the amended goods or services  
to a customer. There’s a two-way flow of value here – typically goods  
and services one way, and some form of payment or “value return” the  
other way.  
27 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
Figure 3-2. The basic business model as enterprise  
There’s not much opportunity for change and enhancement in that  
view, though, and we have no way to see what might affect our enterprise  
from outside, impacting on our direct suppliers and customers. One option  
here, as shown in Figure 3-3, is to expand our view of the supply chain –  
such as in the SCOR \(Supply-Chain Operations Reference\) standard,  
which extends from supplier’s supplier to customer’s customer.  
Figure 3-3. The supply chain as enterprise  
This gives us a good tactical view of our market, but not a good  
strategic one, because there’s more to a market than just our own  
supply chain. Thinking strategically, we also need to be aware of all the  
prospective customers and suppliers, our competitors and other market  
players, industry standards bodies, analysts, government regulators, and  
many more besides, as we can see in Figure 3-4.  
Figure 3-4. The market as enterprise  
28 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
This would seem to make sense as long as we only think in terms  
of the most visible transactions of goods and services. Yet as shown in  
Figure 3-5, there’s much more to an overall enterprise than that, because  
there are many people who may not engage in direct exchange of products  
or services with us, but who are still affected by what we do – and who can  
affect us in return, too.  
Figure 3-5. The shared story as enterprise  
This shared enterprise includes government in the broader sense –  
such as general taxes, rather than industry regulation.  
It includes the families of our employees, the towns and municipalities  
where they live, the broader economic and social communities in which  
we operate and that determine our social “license to operate,” as business  
writer Charles Handy puts it.  
It includes non-clients – people who are not and will probably never be  
customers of ours, such as people who live in a different country than the  
one we serve.  
And it also includes our anti-clients, people who don’t trade with us  
in the normal sense but who don’t like us or what we do – of whom we  
now need to be much more aware, because social media and other new  
technologies provide them with much more leverage than they may have  
had in previous times.  
29 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
The ways in which we interact with this enterprise ecosystem do differ  
from the simple exchanges of goods and services in our main market\: but  
we ignore them at our peril, because they’re the most common cause of  
“unexpected” business problems and even business failure. To make sense  
of this, we need to understand the real nature of the broader “market” of  
the enterprise.  
It’s true that markets are transactions. Most of the visible activity of  
the market is about deals, supply-and-demand, “things” being exchanged  
and paid for – the content of the market supply chain.  
Yet as the Cluetrain Manifesto famously observed, markets are  
conversations. Information is exchanged in many different ways –  
sometimes as the content of the transaction itself, but some of it with little  
direct import for the transaction at hand. Sometimes a conversation is just  
a conversation – yet it’s also evident that it’s an essential component of the  
workings of the market.  
And markets are relationships too. In every market, relationship has  
an enormous bearing on the way the market works – though that fact is  
perhaps more obvious in a street market than in the sanitized “market” of a  
seemingly soulless shopping mall.  
Finally, markets are purpose. In effect, a market is defined by the  
shared purpose of its enterprise vision, the overall descriptor for its  
“common set of missions or goals.”  
Figure 3-6. 30  
Four-dimension tetradian of activity in the marketChapter 3 Service Context and Market  
When we summarize this, it’s clear that, as shown in Figure 3-6,  
there are four distinct strands or dimensions here, each in rough  
correspondence to one of the four core categories of activities and assets\:  
•  
Physical\: Alienable “things” – if I give it to you, I no  
longer have it.  
•  
Virtual\: Non-alienable items such as information – if I  
give it to you, I still have it.  
•  
Relational\: A person-to-person connection that  
cannot be directly exchanged with or transferred to  
anyone else.  
•  
Aspirational\: A personal commitment to an idea or  
belief such as a brand or enterprise vision – again,  
cannot be directly exchanged with or transferred to  
anyone else.  
The usual view of the market is about transaction\: the transfer of  
“exchangeable goods” via the main channel of the supply chain and,  
separately and in return, payment or its equivalent, through a return  
channel. And in its simplest form, profit is the difference between the value  
return that comes in from the return channel from the customer-side,  
compared to the value outlay that goes out on the return channel on the  
supplier-side. Once we also subtract the value outlay for internal costs of  
running the service itself, the result is the “bottom-line” net profit that is  
the near-obsessive focus of so many business folk.  
Yet those transactions of “exchangeable items” are only one part of  
the overall activities of the market; and all of those transactions – and the  
resultant profit – occur only at the tail end of what we might call the market  
cycle, as shown in Figure 3-7.  
31 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
Figure 3-7. The market cycle  
The *market cycle* is a whole-of-organization variant of the more  
generic *service cycle*. We’ll see more on that in Chapter 9,  
“Service Flows.”  
The whole structure of the cycle is a complex feedback loop. For  
example, reputation – which itself is a kind of third-party precursor to  
trust – depends in part on whether the transactions are perceived overall  
as “fair exchange.” Hence, before any transactions can take place, the  
relationships need to exist\: and those relationships – and conversations  
too – are strongly linked to and dependent on the service’s value  
proposition. Likewise, after the transaction, there not only needs to be  
the return-channel exchange that completes the “fair exchange” of the  
transaction, but that too also needs to link back to the value proposition  
and the relationships, tying everything together in terms of the various  
definitions of what “value” actually is within the overall enterprise.  
All of this needs to be symmetrical, in that – in terms of the overall  
market – this service that is our current focus is both a customer of other  
services and a provider to other services; hence, all of the above will  
32 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
apply in similar ways on both “supply side” and “customer side.” We need  
“supplier relationship management,” for example, just as much as we need  
“customer relationship management.”  
And the value transfers and follow-up need to be in terms of all  
forms of “value” defined by the overall enterprise – and not measured  
solely in monetary terms, for example, no matter what the shareholders  
may demand.  
#  Vision, Values, and the Enterprise  
The actual core of an enterprise is its vision, which we’ll explore more in the  
next chapter, “Service Vision and Values.” The key point for here is  
that the vision is a stable, permanent, shared reference point for all players  
in the enterprise – including the organization for whom we’re building an  
enterprise architecture.  
By the way, note that there’s an important distinction we need to note  
here, because there are two quite different meanings of the term  
“vision.”  
For our purposes with Enterprise Canvas, we use the meaning from  
the ISO-9000\:2000 quality-system standard, with “vision” as an  
anchor for the overall quality system for the entire shared enterprise.  
The other meaning, which we don’t use here, is the one used in the  
Business Motivation Model standard, with “vision” as a description of  
some kind of goal or desired outcome.  
Both meanings are valid in their own way, but it’s very important not  
to mix them up, because doing so can cause a lot of confusion.  
33 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
We can summarize all of this in terms of the structure “vision, role,  
mission, goal,” as shown in Figure 3-8.  
Figure 3-8. Organization and enterprise\: vision, role, mission, goal  
The vision expands out to a set of values, which determine what is  
value in the enterprise. The values are expressed in practice as principles,  
which – to use the ISO9000 quality-system terminology – act as the  
guides for policies, which in turn expand out to procedures, and thence  
to the fine detail of work instructions. Yet all of these will anchor back  
to the core vision and values, which determine what value is within the  
enterprise, what we mean when we use the term “value.” And that specific  
combination of “value” and values is unique to each enterprise.  
The enterprise vision and values are shared in some way by all of the  
players in that specific enterprise, which in turn is why they are players  
in that shared enterprise. As shown in Figure 3-9, each of those players  
presents some kind of “value proposition” that aligns with the vision, and  
that then links them with other players in the enterprise.  
34 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
Figure 3-9. Every player presents a value proposition  
Later we’ll explore more of this question of “what is an enterprise,”  
but the key point here is that, as we saw in that rough sketch diagram back  
in Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1, “What Is the Enterprise Canvas?” the vision  
and values traverse vertically through each player – each organization –  
whereas the supply chain or value web provides a horizontal link  
between them.  
Each player thus exists at an intersection in the value web of the overall  
shared enterprise, at a point where organization brings the vision and  
values of the enterprise in touch with its respective roles in the supply  
chain or value web. Every organization within the enterprise provides a  
service within that chosen enterprise. In turn, each organization can be  
subdivided into sub-organizations, and sub-sub-organizations, and so  
on, almost ad infinitum; and each of these “units” provides a service that  
delivers value to the overall enterprise.  
35 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
Figure 3-10. supply chain  
Each service sits at intersection between values and  
As shown in Figure 3-10, each service provides its own unique  
emphases on value\:  
•  
Value proposition\: What the organization commits  
to be responsible for \(what value it will add to the  
enterprise\)  
•  
Value creation\: How, where, and by what means the  
organization will add value to the enterprise  
•  
Value governance\: How the organization will ensure  
that it can, has, and will continue to add value to the  
enterprise  
This set of emphases also links back to those three distinct transaction  
stages that we saw earlier\:  
•  
What happens before transactions of “exchangeable  
items” – an emphasis on relations, which link most  
strongly to the service’s value proposition  
36 Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
•  
What happens during \(and with\) transactions of  
“exchangeable items” – an emphasis on actions, which  
link most strongly to the service’s value creation  
•  
What happens after transactions of “exchangeable  
items” – an emphasis on value transfers \(payments  
and receipts, etc., as “value outlay” and “value return”\)  
and other follow-up and overall integration, which link  
most strongly to the service’s value governance  
In a “service-oriented architecture” of this kind, everything is a  
service – so we’ll see these value themes recur in every part and aspect of  
the organization and enterprise. This provides the basis for our Enterprise  
Canvas – a model we can use in a consistent way to model anything in the  
enterprise.  
#  Into Action  
For your next session with those senior stakeholders for your business-  
transformation project, you’ll want them to think about the world beyond  
the organization itself\: Not just about customers, suppliers, and the more  
immediate realm of the market, but also the broader business context. Use  
the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help you guide that  
conversation.  
#  Organization and Enterprise  
•  
What to you is an organization? What to you is an enterprise?  
Are they the same? If not, how would you distinguish between  
them, and why? How would you explain these differences  
to others, and for what purposes? What are the practical  
implications of treating them as the same, or as separate?

If we view any specific service as “the organization,”  
what is its encompassing “enterprise”? How do you  
make sense of the ways in which all these different  
“enterprises” intersect?

What is the market and industry – or industries – in  
which your organization operates? What is it that  
defines the respective market and industry? What  
belongs in each? What does not belong in each, and  
why? What defines the boundaries?  
Who are your organization’s market – the people  
provide services to your organization, or who use your  
organization’s services?  
In what ways do you distinguish between roles such  
as “supplier” and “customer”? In what ways and for  
what reasons may the boundaries between these roles  
become blurred?  
What are the transactions in that market? What is  
exchanged, by whom, how, and why?  
What are the conversations that take place in that  
market? How do these conversations underpin the  
transactions? In what ways are they distinct from  
the “exchange” transactions – in effect, separate  
transactions in their own right?

Chapter 3 Service Context and Market  
What are the relationships in the market? What creates  
those relationships? How are those relationships  
maintained? What actions, inactions, or events place  
those relationships at risk, or cause damage to those  
relationships? How, and why? And what can be done to  
mitigate those risks?  
What is the purpose of the market – its shared purpose?  
How is this purpose conveyed to and shared by every  
player in that market? What mechanisms exist to keep  
everyone on track to that purpose of the market? What  
happens if a player – whether by accident or intent –  
goes against that shared purpose?  
How do the relationships between players balance  
out across the enterprise? What happens when one  
player tries to take control of the enterprise for their  
own benefit alone, trying to force everyone else into a  
subservient relationship to them? How are those strains  
expressed in practice in the enterprise?

#  Summary  
In this chapter, we explored the context for a service within a shared  
enterprise or shared story that usually extends well beyond not just the  
respective organization, but even beyond the nominal market of that  
organization. The service’s overall “business model” must encompass  
every aspect of that shared enterprise.  
In the next chapter, we’ll go into more detail on the vision and values  
for an enterprise and how to identify these and use them within our  
services and service designs.  
40 CHAPTER 4  
# Service Vision  
# and Values  
The vision is the ultimate anchor for the entire enterprise – perhaps  
the one point on which everyone involved in that enterprise would  
agree. A functional vision for an enterprise is not centered around a  
single organization, and, crucially, it’s not a marketing pitch – although  
marketing may well be derived from it later. Instead, it’s a much simpler  
phrase or “mantra” that summarizes that enterprise’s “reason to be.”  
Good examples of valid visions include the Open Group’s vision about  
supporting “boundaryless information flow,” or the vision for the TED  
conferences, “ideas worth spreading.” We’ll see later here how we can  
derive a working vision for our ZapaMex worked example.  
A vision is literally emotive\: in a very real sense, it needs to be  
powerful enough to drive everyone involved out of bed in the morning,  
helping them to want to get to work for the enterprise. \(This is also a key  
reason why “maximizing returns for our shareholders” rarely works as an  
enterprise vision.\)

41 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
It’s perhaps important to emphasize here that this vision is not  
imposed on the organization from outside by some unspecified “the  
enterprise.” In reality, the organization decides which enterprise to  
“belong” to. The organization *chooses* a vision to work to, but when  
the choosing is done properly, it will instead feel like the enterprise  
vision has chosen *it*.  
The vision is a statement of the core requirement – the “desired ends” –  
for all players in that overall enterprise. Everything else in the entire  
enterprise devolves from that\: everything provides a service as a means  
that contributes toward realizing those desired ends represented by the  
vision of the shared enterprise. Figure 4-1 shows how this works, using the  
TED vision of “ideas worth spreading” as a basic example.  
Figure 4-1. Service as a means to realize desired ends  
42 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
Another way to describe this, as mentioned in the last chapter, is in  
terms of vision, role, mission, goal, and outcomes\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The vision and associated values define the aims of the  
enterprise as shared by all its players – in essence, an  
aspiration or idea.  
The organization identifies its role within this  
enterprise, the part it chooses to play in achieving those  
desired ends – a role which also indicates points of  
connection with other players who choose other parts  
or roles within the overall enterprise.  
The organization’s mission is the set of capabilities  
or services via which it will deliver its overall value  
proposition that will contribute toward achieving the  
vision of the enterprise.  
Each activity within the organization will typically  
contribute toward some bounded goal within the  
organization’s mission and role.  
Every goal in the organization needs an identifiable  
outcome – the realized ends of the service – and that  
outcome needs metrics that link it back to the original  
vision of the enterprise, to indicate achievement in  
terms of those desired ends.  
The outcome’s metrics help to verify the effectiveness of  
the role, mission, goals, and activities in relation to the  
overarching vision.  
Figure 4-2 provides a visual summary of how all these elements link  
together, connecting back and forth between ends and means.  
43 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
Figure 4-2. Linking ends and means  
The anchor for the whole of this “stack” is the enterprise vision –  
hence, that is what we need to identify first.  
#  Identifying the Vision  
In setting out to identify a usable enterprise vision, remember the two key  
criteria here\: that it must be emotive and it must apply to all players in the  
shared enterprise, not just to the organization alone. Before we start, then,  
it’s worthwhile to look at some real-world examples of “visions” that will  
not work for this purpose, and see why they will not work here\:  
•  
Role as “vision” \(brewer example\: “providers of brewed  
products to the Australia/New Zealand market”\)\: This  
blurs the ends and the means, and tends to invite a “so  
what?” response.  
44 •  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
Mission as “vision” \(retailer example\: “achieve and  
maintain 20% of market share”\)\: This is self-referential,  
leaving no room for customers, suppliers, and other  
players in the shared enterprise.  
Goal as “vision” \(car-manufacturer example\: “beat our  
biggest competitor!”\)\: This kills all motivation stone-  
dead when the goal is achieved.  
Desired future condition as “vision” \(IT-unit example\:  
blueprint for “to-be” IT-systems estate\)\: The “future  
state” is effectively mission-as-vision.  
Success criterion as “vision” \(police-department  
example\: “taking a lead in the security of this county”\)\:  
This blurs the activities of the role and the metrics for  
the mission; the success criterion may also be spurious  
or unmeasurable – such as, in this example, no clear  
means for a legally mandated monopoly to measure  
“taking a lead.”  
Marketing slogan as “vision” \(bakery example\: “to be  
the best bakers of the century!”\)\: This combines every  
error above – role-based, self-referential, goal-driven,  
and success criterion without a testable metric.  
An enterprise vision that does work will usually consist of a very brief  
phrase with a distinctive three-part content and structure\:  
•  
Something that identifies the content or focus for this  
enterprise  
•  
Some kind of action on that content or focus  
•  
A qualifier that validates and bridges between content  
and action  
45 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
These components may occur in any order, but all of them need to be  
present in a vision descriptor. Ideally the phrase would be just three words  
long – one word for each element – but will usually be around four to five  
words, and should certainly be no longer than ten.  
For example, take “ideas worth spreading,” the vision for the TED  
conferences. It’s clear, succinct, and emotive – and it conforms exactly to  
that preceding structure\:  
•  
“Ideas” \[content\]  
•  
“Worth” \[qualifier\]  
•  
“Spreading” \[action\]  
Note too that none of these elements describe the organization at  
such\: but they do describe the main content or focus of the overall shared  
enterprise \(“ideas”\); the area of action \(“spreading”\); and the key value  
descriptor \(“worth”\) that defines the meaning of “success,” around which  
meaningful metrics could be built. That’s what we need to look for at  
this stage.  
The content part of the descriptor should be a noun that identifies and  
summarizes the “things” of the enterprise as a whole. These will usually  
not be products or services as such, because that’s just what the players  
in the enterprise deliver to each other in order to create value in the  
enterprise. Instead, it’s more about what those products or services act on  
and are of interest to every player in the enterprise.  
The action part should be a verb, summarizing the overall activity of  
the shared enterprise. If possible, it should be explicit and distinct, rather  
than a generic such as “supporting” or “making” or “creating” – though  
such generics can be useful to give something to work with while searching  
for a more distinctive vision.  
46 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
The qualifier part should be an adjective or suchlike that is both  
emotive and implies some value or valuation – for example, the adjective  
“worth” in the TED vision of “ideas worth spreading” would imply some  
means and value criteria to identify which ideas are worth spreading, and  
which are not.  
To identify the vision, look around both within and outside the  
organization for anything that engages or excites people in their work and  
in their relations with others in the shared enterprise. And excitement or  
engagement is the key here – though note that it can often take somewhat  
strange forms.  
There’s a nice example I saw once on a large billboard beside a freeway  
in Melbourne, Australia. The poster shows a football game at night\: all the  
spectators in the floodlit stadium are intent on the action that’s happening  
on the pitch, just out of shot from the billboard. All spectators except  
one, that is\: there’s a man in yellow rain-slickers, standing up, facing  
the other way to everyone else, gazing up at the huge floodlights. The  
caption? “We’re excited about electricity, even if you’re not.”  
The billboard was for an electricity company, of course, but makes the  
point very well\: you may not be interested in electricity right now, but  
when you *are*, we’re the kind of people you’d probably want to meet.  
Remember that enterprises are *dynamic*, not static\: people in  
“customer”-type roles especially will wander into and out of a shared  
enterprise according to their needs of the time. It’s up to those who  
are most committed to an enterprise to make it of interest to others  
to choose to join in. This is where good marketing will often come  
into the picture, but a better approach is to focus on vision as a way  
to draw people in when they need to connect, and *also* allow them to  
disconnect cleanly when their needs no longer align with that vision.  
47 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
Given all of that, let’s apply this to our ZapaMex worked example.  
First, the content or focus. ZapaMex is a shoemaker, so the seemingly  
obvious choice would be to make it about shoes. But as we talk with the  
ZapaMex team, it becomes clear that they want to broaden this a bit to  
make room for others in the enterprise, and instead shift the focus from  
just the shoes themselves, to the feet that would wear them. We could  
maybe suggest to the team to make this less abstract, more human and  
personal, and say “your feet” as the content that everyone in the enterprise  
is focused on.  
Next, the qualifier, the theme that gives this enterprise its real reason to exist.  
There’s a kind of double theme here\: shoes that look good may make us feel  
happy in that sense, but might not be comfortable or healthy; and conversely,  
shoes that are comfortable may not look all that good. ZapaMex wants to  
be known for shoes that both look good and are healthy and comfortable  
to wear, so we end up here with the phrasing “feel happy and healthy.”  
Finally, the action that everyone is doing about “your feet” and “feel  
happy and healthy.” The team first try “making,” for “making your feet feel  
happy and healthy,” but as a phrase it feels somewhat flat. The team go  
round the loop a few times, and eventually settle on “helping,” because  
that would bring into the enterprise others that work in that space, such as  
podiatrists and so on.  
If we bring those three elements together, this gives ZapaMex an  
enterprise vision of “helping your feet feel happy and healthy.”  
Expect to take several tries at this before you get it right\: our  
experience has been that for most business folk there’s an almost  
automatic reflex to go for marketing “puffery,” and it can take a  
while to find a way past that habit. But when you *do* get it right, you’ll  
recognize it immediately – it’ll engage everyone straight away, both  
outside and inside the organization, and have an *aliveness* to it that  
just isn’t there in the usual marketing slogans.  
48 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
There are many other possible vision descriptors that ZapaMex could  
have chosen, of course\: for example, if they had focused on shoes rather  
than feet, they might have ended up with a vision such as “celebrating the  
beauty of shoes” or “making sturdy, reliable footwear.” The vision descriptor  
is always a choice. Note, though, that each of those vision descriptors will  
denote a different enterprise, with different values, guiding principles,  
and success criteria, and often also a different set of players in that overall  
enterprise. Whatever we choose as the vision descriptor will have real  
consequences throughout the organization and the broader shared  
enterprise within which it operates – so we do need to choose it with care.  
#  Values, Principles, and Success Criteria  
The vision itself should suggest distinct values, either direct from the  
“qualifier” part of the vision descriptor or by implication. The values that  
we need to identify here are those values that are needed to realize the  
desired ends indicated by the vision, and hence values that we actually  
want and need in the organization.  
To identify the values that are required for an enterprise, assess what  
“effectiveness” would look like within the enterprise. Some values, such  
as fairness, trust, and financial probity, would all be required in any  
functional enterprise. Other values, though, will arise from the specific  
enterprise and its vision, and we can usually derive those just from  
the feelings that arise during some quiet contemplation on the vision  
descriptor and its implications in practice across the various aspects of  
the enterprise. To illustrate this with our ZapaMex worked example, its  
vision descriptor of “helping your feet feel happy and healthy” tells us two  
values straight away\: “happy” and “healthy.” It also implies some other  
values such as comfort, support, satisfaction, “looking good, feeling good,”  
and so on. For each of these values, we’ll need to include metrics in our  
architectures and service designs to monitor how well our organization is  
performing relative to the respective value.  
49 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
Note, though, that those enterprise-level values must by definition  
apply everywhere across the entire shared enterprise. For example,  
ZapaMex’s values of “happy and healthy” would not just be about shoes,  
or for the people who wear those shoes, but also for everyone who makes  
them, everyone who finds or grows and manufactures the materials to  
make them, everyone who sells them, or advertises them, or provides  
podiatry or healthcare or is involved in sports that would use them, and  
so on and so on – every player and stakeholder across the entire shared  
enterprise. And in turn, it’s in ZapaMex’s business interest to ensure that  
those values do apply in all those perhaps-unexpected places across that  
shared enterprise within which it operates. That’s the real meaning of the  
enterprise vision descriptor and the values that arise from it.  
When we start to expand on these, we should also note that there’s  
often a large difference between *required* values, *espoused* values,  
and *enacted* values – and we need to be clear which is which!  
*Required values* are the values we need to make the enterprise work.  
*Espoused values* are the values that the organization claims that it  
holds to, and to which it expects to be held accountable. *Enacted*  
*values* are the values that the organization *actually* lives by – which  
in some cases may be *very* different even from the espoused values,  
let alone the required values.  
To identify actual enacted values, explore the behaviors or phrases  
actually used within the organization, or as indicated in social media  
and the like. Stafford Beer’s somewhat cynical yet often painfully  
accurate dictum poSIWID – “the purpose of the system is \[expressed  
in\] what it does” – can also be a useful guideline here. Note, though,  
that these actual values will often vary at different levels or in  
different parts of the organization, and differ again as seen from  
inside or outside.  
50 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
From values we move to principles, because the organization’s  
principles describe how its values should be expressed in practice. In  
themselves, values are somewhat abstract, whereas principles are – or  
should be – concrete, actionable, and verifiable. \(Values on their own are  
just a “nice idea”\: it’s only when they’re expressed as principles that they  
become meaningful in practice as values.\)  
Principles represent core reasons and decisions for the organization,  
pervading the values throughout every layer and function, downward  
into the fine detail of systems designs and individual actions. We typically  
document each principle in a four-part structure\:  
•  
Name\: A succinct summary of the principle itself  
•  
Statement\: An unambiguous description of the rule and  
its intent  
•  
Rationale\: The practical benefits from following the  
principle  
•  
Implications\: Summary of probable impacts and gains  
from following the principle, and costs, risks, or losses  
from not following it  
If we take the Zapamex value of “happy and healthy” as an example,  
one principle that would devolve from that value might be defined as  
follows\:  
•  
•  
Name\: Protect and preserve health of employees.  
Statement\: ZapaMex shall take action to support the  
health of all employees, by subsidizing healthcare  
costs, by providing health and safety training to all  
employees, by providing safety equipment and safety  
systems as needed throughout all ZapaMex sites, by  
continually assessing and taking action on all health-  
related risks, and by monitoring health metrics in order  
to guide such action.  
51 Chapter 4 ServICe vISIon and Values  
•  
Rationale\: Employee health is directly related to  
productivity and to risk reduction and risk mitigation;  
protecting employee health therefore protects  
productivity and reduces business risk.  
•  
Implications\: By protecting employee health, productivity  
will be maintained; failing to protect employee health will  
negatively impact productivity, and is likely to increase a  
wide variety of different types of risk.  
The same value of “healthy and happy” might well lead ZapaMex to  
want to extend the same concerns to the employees and others at their  
suppliers – but that would need to be expressed as a different principle,  
because ZapaMex can only influence what happens at their suppliers, and  
does not have the same choices that they have about what to do within the  
ZapaMex organization itself.  
One obvious complication is that principles will often compete or  
conflict\: transparency versus privacy, for example, or innovation versus  
the safety of “the known.” We’ll return to this later in Chapter 10,  
“Service Guidance”; for now, just document any such clashes you  
can see, and move on.  
Finally, we need to identify key success criteria and potential fail  
criteria, and also their matching metrics, that would apply across the entire  
shared enterprise and hence also for and within our own organization.  
In many cases, we can derive these from the “Implications” section of  
the documentation for the respective principles, as above. In the ZapaMex  
example of that principle of “Protect and preserve health of employees,”  
a matching success criterion might be that health metrics in a given year  
have been maintained or improved relative to the previous year, while a  
matching fail criterion would be that health metrics have worsened by a  
statistically significant amount.

#  Summary  
In this chapter, we saw how the shared enterprise is defined by its vision  
and values. Every service within the enterprise needs to align with  
the vision and values, and assist in making them real via appropriate  
principles, metrics, and matching success criteria – and demonstrate that  
it does so, through meaningful metrics. A simple checklist of “vision, role,  
mission, goal, outcomes” can help our stakeholders make sense of this  
in practice; further checklists help the process of identifying the values,  
principles, and success criteria that arise from the vision.  
In the next chapter, we will explore the key architectural concept  
of layers of abstraction and see how this applies to services and  
service design.  
56 CHAPTER 5  
# Service Layers  
One of the core concepts for the Enterprise Canvas is the notion of  
layering. We need to be clear, though, as to what type of layering we mean,  
and what we don’t, because there are at least four different types of layers  
that are in common use in the business context\:  
•  
Layers of separation \(often as “distance-from-self”\)  
•  
Layers of reporting relationships \(management  
hierarchy\)  
•  
Layers of decomposition \(fractal structure of services,  
sub-units, etc.\)  
•  
Layers of realization \(from abstract to concrete\)  
Layers of separation are always relative to a single focus point that is  
chosen as “the center,” and all relationships are mapped outward from  
there. This is often useful in service design, as we’ll see in Chapter 6,  
“Service Actors and Other Entities,” and even more in Chapter 7, “Service  
Roles and Relationships.”  
© Tom Graves 2023  
T. Graves, Mapping the Enterprise, https\://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-9836-7\_5  
57 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
That kind of layering can be problematic, though, if the focus theme  
becomes hardwired and cannot be changed. One common example  
of this is the “BDAT stack” of business, data, applications, and  
technology infrastructure, as used in many IT architectures, and in  
which the IT itself is regarded as the fixed “the center” around which  
everything else revolves. In general, we should avoid using that kind  
of hardwired content-based layering with Enterprise Canvas and  
service design.  
Reporting relationships are important, of course, but any apparent  
layering of those relationships depends on management hierarchies that  
could be changed at any moment. Instead, we need to focus more on  
the information flows and guidance roles for service management and  
then allow any layering of reporting relationships and the like to arise  
dynamically from that. We’ll see more on this in the section “Information  
Flows for Service Management” in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” and the  
section “Direction Services” in Chapter 10, “Service Guidance.”  
Layers of decomposition provide a way to describe how services are  
composed of sub-services, units are composed of sub-units, and so on.  
This is a core aspect of Enterprise Canvas, as we’ll see later in Chapter 12,  
“Service Decomposition.”  
Layers of abstraction and realization are fundamental to the Enterprise  
Canvas, because they describe how to connect abstract ideas to concrete  
reality, and also because each service may need to be described in  
different ways dependent on the current layer of abstraction. That core  
concern is the focus of this chapter.  
58 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
#  Layers of Abstraction and Realization  
For our purposes with Enterprise Canvas and service design, we use seven  
distinct layers of abstraction. The numbering for these layers starts at “0”  
\(zero\) rather than “1,” for compatibility with the commonly used Zachman  
framework.  
Figure 5-1. Layers of abstraction for Enterprise Canvas  
As shown in Figure 5-1, these layers are distinct from each other  
because they each add something more at each transition “downward”  
in the stack. Row-0 is essentially timeless; Rows 1–5 – as in Zachman –  
describe views of what we intend to happen in the future, moving  
downward from big picture to fine detail; the “Now,” the moment of real-  
time action, sits at the boundary between Row-5 and Row-6; and Row-6 is  
about the past, a record of what has happened, which we can use to guide  
us to keep on track to the desired ends of the vision.  
59 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
As a general rule, we will need a different Enterprise Canvas model  
for each layer of abstraction, to show the respective level of detail for that  
layer. The only routine exception to this rule is where we want to show how  
one layer devolves or translates into another.  
In Row-0 Enterprise, this topmost layer usually consists of just one  
item – the descriptor for the broader shared enterprise as a whole, as  
defined by its vision and values. For ZapaMex, as shown in Figure 5-2,  
this would be their vision statement of “helping your feet feel happy and  
healthy.”  
Figure 5-2. Row-0 Enterprise\: vision and values  
This entity represents every possible service in the shared enterprise;  
and in turn, every service devolves from this entity and must, in some way,  
support the vision, values, principles, and success criteria defined by this  
entity. We explored these themes for Row-0 earlier in Chapter 4, “Service  
Vision and Values.”  
In Row-1 Scope, the layer consists of lists of key elements for the  
shared enterprise, without any relationships or attributes as such. For  
ZapaMex, these will be the key elements that make up its shared enterprise  
of “helping your feet feel happy and healthy.” Note, though, that this is  
about the whole shared enterprise, not solely the part of that enterprise  
that ZapaMex will address. Ultimately, the enterprise as a whole will only  
work if at least one player in the story will address each element – and if  
ZapaMex itself doesn’t want to work with some element of the enterprise,  
then it’s in its business interest to ensure that there is someone else who  
will do so.  
60 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
Figure 5-3. Row-1 Scope\: lists of entities  
We do need to keep things simple at this level\: each list should usually  
consist of no more than around ten items of that respective type. As shown  
in Figure 5-3, one common way to populate these lists is by using the  
interrogatives Who, What, How, Where, When, and Why in relation to the  
shared enterprise as a whole. For example, the “Who” list would identify  
relevant player roles in the enterprise, including the role that the organization  
itself will choose. We’ll explore these themes about the “Who” of the enterprise  
in more detail in Chapter 6, “Service Actors and Other Entities.”  
In Row-2 Business Model, we add relationships between the roles  
and other elements – in other words, we start to add the horizontal value  
network to the vertical dimension of shared value, to identify the types of  
services to be presented by each role or other entity. These relationships are  
determined in part by the respective value propositions offered by and to  
each of the players. Given this level of detail, ZapaMex can select one of the  
roles as its chosen strategic positioning within the overall shared enterprise.  
Figure 5-4. Row-2 Business Model\: roles and relationships  
61 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
This is the first layer at which we start to see services as such, though  
only a very abstract level. As shown in Figure 5-4, each role presents its  
own set of services, and various products and suchlike related to those  
services that it will exchange with other roles. We explore these themes and  
the differences between a whole-of-enterprise view and an organization-  
specific view of the services, in more depth in Chapter 7, “Service Roles  
and Relationships.”  
In Row-3 Service Model \(also known as the system model or logical  
model layer\), we start to include more details of attributes alongside the  
relationships, describing the internals of each high-level service and the  
flows between them. At this level, these are always abstract and generic\:  
they define one or more classes of possible implementations, but do not  
specify any particular technology or method. For ZapaMex, it would use  
descriptions at this layer not only to describe the services it presents to  
other players in the shared enterprise, but also its own internal services, of  
any type and at any level.  
Figure 5-5. Row-3 Service Model\: abstract structures and flows  
62 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
As shown in Figure 5-5, this is the first layer in which we would use the  
full Enterprise Canvas to describe the internal structure of each service,  
along with high-level overviews of its interactions with other services. We’ll  
explore the various aspects of these themes within the series of chapters  
from Chapter 8, “Service Structure,” onward to Chapter 14, “Services As  
Systems.”  
In Row-4 Design Model \(also known as the physical model layer\),  
we move into more detailed design, building complete specifications for  
technologies, processes, interfaces, flows, protocols, skillsets, and the  
like, translating the abstract system models into requirements and project  
plans for detailed implementation, all the way down to final deployment.  
For ZapaMex, this is where it would choose how to implement each of its  
services, with the right mix of people, machines, and IT in each case.  
Figure 5-6. Row-4 Design Model\: specifications for implementation  
On the surface, this type of model would look much the same as for  
the Row–3 Service Model\: the difference, as shown in Figure 5-6, is that  
in this layer we describe an actual intended solution rather than a whole  
class of possible implementations. We would need to go into more specific  
implementation detail here and would be likely to do much more service  
63 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
decomposition to describe that detail. Much as we did for Row-3, we’ll  
explore the respective themes in each of that set of chapters from Chapter 8,  
“Service Structure,” onward to Chapter 14, “Services As Systems.”  
In Row-5 Deployment Model \(also known as the operations model  
or action plan\), we add the extra details needed to specify a service  
configuration to be used and/or enacted on a specific day at a specific  
location for a specific purpose with specific staff, and so on. For example,  
where the Row-4 design model might specify a database server, here  
we need to know the exact identifiers, types, configurations, physical  
locations, and virtual addresses of the production servers, fallback servers,  
development servers, test servers, and all the related support equipment  
and switchgear. For ZapaMex, this would include down-to-the-ground  
details such as the staff-roster for the morning shift on February 24th for  
the shoe-assembly section of the factory floor.  
Figure 5-7. Row-5 Deployment Model\: run-time action plan  
We could describe this layer with the Enterprise Canvas in the  
same way as for Row-3 and Row-4, but as shown in Figure 5-7, there  
would be a lot more detail embedded in the model. This is below  
where most architecture and change teams would work, though they  
64 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
would occasionally dive down into this level of detail to gain a better  
understanding of qualitative concerns such as availability, adaptability,  
variance in loads, and so on.  
In Row-6 Action Record, we gather all of the information collected  
during any kind of operations or other actions. Unlike the other layers,  
this layer is not a model of an intended future, but a record of actions  
in the past. For ZapaMex, this would include the reports for managers  
and the like, but also the records that would be used by external auditors  
and regulators, by the organization’s own change teams looking to  
improve business capabilities and processes, and by the procurement  
teams needing to make sure that all the materials needed for next week’s  
production run will be available whenever they’re needed.  
Figure 5-8. Row-6 Action Record\: detailed metrics  
As shown in Figure 5-8, these metrics would describe the same level  
of detail as in the Row–5 action plan. In principle, the core of it should  
be exactly the same as in that action plan, but in practice it will often be  
different in various ways\: for example, rostered staff might have been  
absent for any number of reasons; a machine or server broke down;  
people got switched around onto different machines; half of the expected  
customers were at home watching the football match; a traffic-hold-up  
forced a change of the delivery schedule; and so on.  
65 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
Figure 5-9. Action Record metrics close the loop  
As shown in Figure 5-9, all those kinds of details and everyday  
differences help to close the loop in the change process, connecting the  
real world back to the initial intent and to every other stage in between.  
Although there’s no chance of changing anything in this layer – because it’s  
all in the past – these records are extremely important to process designers,  
to organizational-learning specialists, and to others who do extensive  
system design \(Row-3 and Row-4\) in order to enhance effectiveness at the  
operational level \(Row-5\). Whenever we do any work with the Enterprise  
Canvas, at any layer, we should always aim to identify Row-5/Row-6  
metrics that could help us to keep on track to the initial Row-0 enterprise  
vision, values, and principles.

#  Into Action  
With the organization’s big picture “Why” for your business-  
transformation project established in the previous session, you now need  
the conversations to move more toward the “How.” For this session, your  
stakeholders will be team leads and key players from project management.  
You want to introduce them to the need for consistency in the way things  
67 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
are described in models, designs and plans for change, and the value  
of a consistent model of “layers of abstraction and realization.” Use the  
ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help you guide that  
conversation\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Does what you’re looking at describe anything other  
than vision, values, or principles? \(If so, the layer must  
be Row-1 or below.\)  
Is it simply a list of items, without relationships  
between those items? \(If so, it will be in Row-1, or  
Row-3 if internal details and attributes of those items  
are also described.\)  
Does it describe relationships between items? \(If so, it  
must be in Row-2 or below.\)  
Does it describe detailed attributes of items, or flows  
between items? \(If so, it must be in Row-3 or below.\)  
Does it describe a specific implementation, technology,  
vendor, business process, or the like? \(If so, it must be  
in Row-4 or below.\)  
Does it specify explicit deployment details – a complete  
set of assets, functions, locations, capabilities, trigger  
events, and business rules? \(If so, it must be in Row-5  
or below.\)  
Does it describe a record of something that has already  
happened in the past? \(If so, it must be in Row-6.\)  
68 ChapTEr 5 ServICE Layers  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we discovered that a service may be usefully described in  
terms of a set of distinct layers of abstraction, extending from the idealized  
vision down to the concrete reality of what was actually achieved. As we  
move downward through the layers of abstraction from overall intent to  
real-world implementation, the same nominal service will need to be  
described in different ways, with different levels of detail.  
In the next chapter, we start to move toward realizing the vision,  
identifying the key actors, assets, and other entities that would be required  
to make the vision happen in the real world.  
69 CHAPTER 6  
# Service Actors  
# and Other Entities  
One of the key functions of the Enterprise Canvas is to help us to think  
wider, to understand more about the ecosystem in which our organization  
operates. Among other advantages, doing this will also help us to identify  
“unexpected” opportunities and risks.  
To do this exploration, we need to go right back to the roots, beyond  
the nominally “known” of our organization. Given that we’ve already  
seen how to identify the core vision and values of the shared enterprise  
for Row-0, back in Chapter 4, “Service Vision and Values,” what we aim to  
do here in Row-1 is to identify all of the key items or “elements” that are  
needed to make this enterprise happen.  
At this level, we always look at the whole shared enterprise – not solely  
the view as seen from our own organization’s perspective. Later, in Row-2,  
and especially in Row-3 and below, we’ll identify the parts of the enterprise  
that our organization will choose to do or not do, for its own business  
model and the like; but for this part of the work, we will need a complete  
picture of the shared enterprise, so that we can also identify the roles and  
activities that others will play.

71 Chapter 6 Service aCTors and oTher eNTities  
Figure 6-1. Every element in each list links back to enterprise vision  
As shown in Figure 6-1, we do this here by circling around six simple  
interrogatives\: Who, What, How, Where, When, and Why. The answers we  
derive for any one of those queries will often trigger off a review of one or  
more of the others, and so on, round and round, until we have every key  
element or element type for the enterprise somewhere in our lists. We do  
need to remember to include not just our basic supply chain, but extend  
outward to the industry and market, all the way out to the entirety of the  
shared enterprise, as in the “shared-story-as-enterprise” model that we  
saw in “Service and Market” in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market”\).  
Note that we do need to keep some sense of focus here, because in  
many cases the answers could run almost to infinity. The idea is to  
gather “just enough detail” to guide subsequent development and  
enquiry\: aim to gather perhaps ten to twenty elements for each of the  
interrogatives, but probably not much more than that.  
For simplicity, it’s best to focus on element types rather than specific  
elements at this stage\: we’ll assign names and other more specific details  
later in Row-2 and below, as we’ll see in Chapter 7, “Service Roles and  
Relationships.”  
72 Chapter 6 Service aCTors and oTher eNTities  
The “Who?” question asks us who is likely to be involved, is likely to  
feel engaged in and motivated by the vision and its values. For ZapaMex’s  
vision of “helping your feet feel happy and healthy,” this list would,  
of course, include ZapaMex itself, but it would also include anyone  
who’s interested in footwear for any reason\: the general buying public,  
fashionistas, sports facilities and trainers, schools, general health and  
footcare specialists, industrial health and safety, and so on. It includes  
people on the supply side\: manufacturers of materials, or, further back,  
the farmers and others who supply those materials. There are marketers,  
advertisers, and event organizers. On the distribution side, there would  
be retailers, wholesalers, warehouses, and logistics providers. There are  
local or national government, the communities, employees’ families, and  
others. And there are standards bodies, testers, market analysts, and other  
industry-level players.  
Note that we *don’t* use role labels such as “supplier” or “customer”  
or “competitor” here\: we only describe the type of player or “actor”  
*relative to the enterprise as a whole*, not relative to ourselves as an  
organization. We’ll come back to that role analysis later, in Row-2\:  
see Chapter 7, “Service Roles and Relationships.”  
The “What?” question asks for a list of assets or resources that would  
be needed within the shared enterprise. \(For this purpose, there’s no  
need to distinguish between assets and resources; the distinction we’ll  
use later is that assets are resources for which the organization is directly  
responsible.\) We need here to include not just physical assets, but also  
information and other virtual assets, relational assets that provide links  
to real people, and aspirational assets such as brands. For ZapaMex’s  
enterprise, this includes complete shoes, shoe components, and shoe-  
making equipment and facilities; it includes buildings and physical and  
73 Chapter 6 Service aCTors and oTher eNTities  
virtual \(web\) distribution channels; it includes customer records and  
customer relations; it includes brands, both for each organization and for  
the industry as a whole.  
The “How?” question asks for functions, processes, and capabilities  
that would be needed to create value within the enterprise. \(Often these  
may be bundled rather carelessly together with the “Who?” elements, but  
it’s best to describe them separately because that often highlights other  
opportunities and risks later on in the model-development process.\)  
For ZapaMex, this would include shoe design, shoe-making, shoe retail,  
assessment of footwear needs, marketing, materials manufacture,  
materials acquisition, logistics, testing, and so on.  
Note that, for simplicity, we do bundle function, process, and  
capability together here as if they’re the same. They’re not, but the  
distinctions don’t really matter at this level. They *do* matter when we  
go further down into the detail, but we can sort that out later\: see  
Chapter 13, “Service Content.”  
The “Where?” question asks about locations of all types – physical,  
virtual, or otherwise. For ZapaMex’s enterprise, the geographical locations  
are actually worldwide, even though ZapaMex itself only operates in  
Mexico. Note that there’s also often a cross-over here between Where and  
What – or rather, that many What elements, such as warehouses and retail  
outlets, will each have a physical location as well. Include virtual locations  
such as phones, emails, and websites; include relational locations such as  
supplier or market networks; and note too that brands often have a kind of  
“location” relative to each other as well.  
The “When?” question asks about events that are important in and  
to the shared enterprise. For ZapaMex’s enterprise these would include  
physical events, such as materials arriving at a factory, or a parcel entering  
or leaving logistics. It would include virtual or information-related events,  
74 Chapter 6 Service aCTors and oTher eNTities  
such as the accounting cycle or the tax cycle. It would include composite  
events such as the physical and relational event of a customer-prospect  
walking into a store. And it might also include aspirational events such  
as PR impacts on a brand. There are plenty of examples to choose from  
there, anyway.  
The “Why?” question is the one that is most strongly linked to the  
enterprise vision – because the vision is the core “why” for the entire  
enterprise – but it also asks about other types of decisions that are required  
for the proper functioning of the shared enterprise. For ZapaMex, these  
would include decisions to launch or close a product; to expand or  
contract market positioning, in any sense of the term; or to place orders for  
materials or to purchase products.  
Each question cross-links with other questions\: Why leads to How  
leads to When, which leads back to Why; What may lead to How, and  
onward to Who, which again leads us to How. Anywhere may take us  
anywhere else, and often does – hence, this kind of exploration is often  
iterative, each question triggering off a review of the content previously  
provided via another question.  
Note also that  
•  
The What will link strongly to the “things” or context of  
the vision descriptor \(“your feet,” for ZapaMex’s vision\).  
•  
The Why will link strongly to the qualifier of the vision  
descriptor \(“feel happy and healthy,” for ZapaMex\).  
•  
The “How” will link strongly to the action verb of the  
vision descriptor \(“helping,” for ZapaMex\).  
Once again, remember that the end result of this enquiry is a set of  
lists, without any explicit relationships between them; and it covers the  
whole of the shared enterprise, not solely the organization or service that is  
the main focus of our interest.

#  Into Action  
For the next session in your business-transformation project, you’ll work  
with the same stakeholders, and perhaps some others at the executive  
level, to map out the big picture of the business context and all the “Row-1”  
elements that underpin that overall story. Use the ideas in this chapter and  
the following questions to help you guide that conversation\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Who are the people and organizations needed to make  
the vision come to life in the real world? What links  
each of these actors to the vision and values of the  
shared enterprise?  
What types of assets and resources are needed to make  
the vision a reality? What links each of these elements  
to the vision and values of the shared enterprise?  
What functions, processes, and capabilities are  
needed to make the vision a reality? What links each of  
these elements to the vision and values of the shared

#  Summary  
In this chapter, we explored how to identify all the key types of actors,  
assets, and other entities that would be required to make the vision  
happen in the real world. At this level, these are just lists of items or  
elements, though the list will include the organization or service that will  
be our main focus of attention.  
In the next chapter, we will discover how to identify and map out the  
roles of the enterprise and the relationships between them.

# Service Roles  
# and Relationships  
In the brainstorming exercise for Row-1 Scope, in the previous chapter,  
we identified all the key elements needed to make the vision of the shared  
enterprise a reality – Who, What, How, Where, When, and Why. Here we’ll  
do the same for the Row-2 Business Model layer\: we now need to link  
all of those elements and items together into a complete picture of the  
enterprise and then establish our organization’s proper place within that  
picture.  
For this exercise, we carry through the lists we created in Row-1,  
ready to use as our source material for a new set of cross-maps of roles,  
responsibilities, and relationships.  
For a whiteboard session, we might set out the elements in each list  
as individual sticky notes, using a different color sticky note for each  
of the lists.  
We then pick one list to start with – typically “Who” – and build a  
map of the working enterprise from the content of that list. In effect, each  
“Who” presents one or more services to the overall enterprise\: in which  
case, what are those services? Who consumes them? Who provides them?  
What will flow between those services in each interaction? This helps us

to build an initial map of the players in the enterprise and the probable  
relationships between them. For example, we could map out the players  
and relationships in ZapaMex’s shared enterprise of “helping your feet feel  
happy and healthy” in a layout such as that shown in Figure 7-1.  
Figure 7-1. Roles and relationships for the whole shared enterprise  
If we start from “Who” in this way, that review will automatically  
raise questions about what is used in each service, and transferred as  
products in each interaction with other players. We could explore what  
is done in each player’s services, how it is done, where it takes place, the  
trigger events for each interaction, and the decisions needed in each case  
to keep the overall flow of value around the enterprise on track to the  
overall vision.  
80 Chapter 7 Service Roles and Relationships  
Note that it doesn’t actually matter which list we start with\: we can  
do the same kind of map by starting with “What,” or “How,” or any  
of the other lists. Whichever way we do it, the aim is to build up a  
picture of the overall flow of value around the enterprise, and who or  
what is responsible for each activity and decision in each case.  
So far all of that has been relative to the shared enterprise – not to our  
own organization. To make sense of where we fit in that shared enterprise,  
we do another map in which we place our own organization at the center,  
assigning ourselves one or more roles from the “Who” list. We then  
select elements from each of the other lists that represent what our own  
organization does – or, for a “to-be” map, what our organization would  
choose to do – to play its part in this overall enterprise.  
As can be seen in Figure 7-2, ZapaMex does this by placing itself in  
the role of a shoe manufacturer that sells direct to its client, without an  
intermediary shoe retailer run by a different organization. It does connect  
with podiatrists and other medical aspects of footwear, but it does not  
intend at present to make sportswear, so it doesn’t need to connect  
with that aspect of the shared enterprise. We can also identify who its  
competitors would be\: they’re organizations that connect directly with the  
same types of players that ZapaMex does.  
81 Chapter 7 Service Roles and Relationships  
Figure 7-2. Roles and relationships relative to the organization  
Every other element in the lists that is not referenced in our own  
organization’s map is something that our organization would choose to not  
do, yet needs to exist for the overall enterprise to work well. In other words,  
we do need it to exist somewhere in the overall story, and be addressed by  
someone in that story, even if we ourselves don’t do it or use it. Which, in  
turn, defines our relationships with all of those aspects of the enterprise  
that we \(or our organization\) will choose not to do.  
Roles relative to our own organization will fall out automatically from  
the respective relationships and mutual responsibilities. For example, we  
can identify three classic supply-chain roles\:  
•  
Anyone who provides a service, or has responsibility  
for an item, that we need in playing our part in the  
enterprise has a potential supplier relationship with us.  
•  
Anyone who, for their part in the enterprise, has need  
of a service or item for which we have responsibility,  
has a potential customer relationship with us.  
82 Chapter 7 Service Roles and Relationships  
•  
Anyone whose part in the enterprise suggests that they  
need a relationship with any potential “customer”  
or potential “supplier” of ours may have a potential  
competitor and/or partner relationship with us.  
Note that other players may well have multiple roles relative to us  
in terms of the whole enterprise\: the same organization could well be  
supplier, customer, competitor, and partner, all in distinct and separate  
relationships relative to us.  
We need to keep developing this map until all of the elements that we  
identified in the Row-1 Scope exercise have been referenced at least once  
somewhere in either of the models – the whole-enterprise map, or our own  
organization’s map. The reason for this is that we’ve already established  
that each of these elements is needed for the effective operation of the  
overall enterprise\: so if there’s no one doing that type of work, or we have  
no direct or indirect relationship to it, then it represents either a risk to  
us or to the whole enterprise. In either case, the apparent risk may well  
represent a worthwhile business opportunity for someone – and it might  
well be us. That point can often be useful indeed.  
Remember that this is really only an idealized overview at this stage\:  
the real-world detail will come later, in Row-3 Service Model and below.  
We need to develop a good sense of the overall flows – the nodes and links  
of the value network that enacts the enterprise – but we also need at this  
stage to keep the emphasis here on the abstract big-picture view, and not  
allow ourselves to get dragged down too far into the depths of the detail.  
#  Into Action  
In this session for your business-transformation project, you’ll want that  
same group of team leads, project-management group, strategy team, and  
executives to map out the “Row-2” description of the roles, relationships,  
and responsibilities across the big-picture business context and the

86 Chapter 7 Service Roles and Relationships  
#  Summary  
In this chapter, we discovered how to map out the roles and relationships  
across the whole shared enterprise, and also relative to our own  
organization’s chosen position within that shared enterprise. This tells us  
how value moves around the shared enterprise and suggests the services  
that would be needed to support that overall flow of value.  
In the next chapter, we start to explore the structure of services, using  
the core of the Enterprise Canvas model as a visual checklist and template.  
87 CHAPTER 8  
# Service Structure  
In Row-2 Business Model, in the previous chapter, we established a  
big-picture overview of the shared enterprise as a whole and of our  
organization’s role and place within it. That overview provides an  
important anchor for strategy, but we also need to start to link that strategy  
down toward real-world action. To do this, we turn to the Enterprise  
Canvas template, as a systematic means to model the services of the  
enterprise. We’ll divide this into six parts\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The overall structure of services, in a generic sense –  
described in this chapter.  
The flows between services that create the value web of  
the enterprise – see Chapter 9, “Service Flows.”  
The various related services that help to link this  
service with others and keep it on track to the aims  
of the overall enterprise – see Chapter 10, “Service  
Guidance.”  
Relationships with the service’s investors and  
beneficiaries, in various forms of value – see Chapter 11,  
“Service Investors and Beneficiaries.”  
How to expand each of these descriptions out into  
detailed real-world services – see Chapter 12, “Service  
Decomposition.”

89 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
•  
The fine detail of the structure and content of each  
of these services and flows – see Chapter 13, “Service  
Content.”  
For here, though, we’ll summarize a structure that can be applied to  
any type of service.  
To start on this, we go back to the notion that a service is a means via  
which the desired ends of the vision can be achieved in the real world.  
The service does this in part by linking “vertically” to the enterprise vision  
and adding to the value flow as it moves “horizontally” around the overall  
shared enterprise, as shown in Figure 8-1.  
Figure 8-1. Service at intersection of vision and value flow  
Some while back, in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market,” we  
saw that each service provides its own three distinct views on value –  
value proposition, value creation, and value governance – and that  
these, respectively, relate to what happens before, during, and after the  
main transactions of “exchangeable value.” That was about the internal  
operation of the service itself; but we can also generalize that three-way  
view to include the matching relations with services on the incoming  
side of the supply chain, from suppliers or service providers, and on the  
outgoing side, to customers or service consumers.  
90 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
The relationships with other services are symmetrical in the sense  
that every service shares the same pattern\: the only difference between  
“supplier-side” and “customer-side” is the main direction of service flow  
relative to the entity that is our current focus of attention\:  
•  
Future/before-oriented relationships are essentially  
peer-to-peer and will flow back and forth in both  
directions.  
•  
Present/during-oriented relationships are mainly  
about supply-chain transfer of goods and services from  
supplier to self, or self to customer \(i.e., left-to-right on  
the Canvas\).  
•  
Past/after-oriented relationships are mainly about  
balancing the supply-chain transfer via a “return  
channel” from customer to self, and self to supplier  
\(i.e., right-to-left on the Canvas\).  
This gives us a three-by-three nine-cell matrix that summarizes  
clusters of “child” services within each service, all of which are necessary  
in some form for the proper operation of that service.  
A service serves – and in every case, what it’s really serving is the vision  
of the enterprise, via the mission that underpins its role in the enterprise.  
This nine-cell structure, as shown in Figure 8-2, gives a first glance at how  
it actually delivers its service, in relationship with other services.  
91 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
Figure 8-2. Nine-cell service structure  
Let’s explore each of these cells in a bit more detail\:  
– Supplier-side \(inbound to this service\)\:  
•  
Supplier relations \(supplier-side/future\)\: Build and  
maintain relationships with potential and/or actual  
“supplier” service-provider entities, about things that  
may or will need to happen in the future and to keep on  
track to the vision.  
•  
Supplier channels \(supplier-side/present\)\: Receive  
goods and/or services from “supplier” entities.  
•  
Value outlay \(supplier-side/past\)\: Provide balance  
or compensation to “supplier” entities \(such as pay  
for goods\).  
– Self \(what this service does\)\:  
•  
Value proposition \(self/future\)\: Identify what this entity  
will do and deliver, aligned to the overall enterprise  
purpose and values.  
92 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
•  
Value creation \(self/present\)\: Take all actions necessary  
to create and deliver the goods and/or services  
specified in the value proposition.  
•  
Value governance \(self/past\)\: Ensure the appropriate  
functioning of the overall entity, balancing past,  
present, and future.  
– Customer-side \(outbound from this service\)\:  
•  
Customer relations \(customer-side/future\)\: Build and  
maintain relationships with potential and/or actual  
“customer” service-consumer entities, mainly about  
what may or should happen in the future, and to  
communicate the value proposition in relation to the  
enterprise vision.  
•  
Customer channels \(customer-side/present\)\: Deliver  
goods and/or services to “customer” entities.  
•  
Value return \(customer-side/past\)\: Receive balance or  
compensation from “customer” entities \(e.g., payment  
for goods\).  
To guide consistency, we would initially assign the cells with those  
generic labels such as supplier relations. In practice, though, we would  
more usually translate those generic labels into those of other real-world  
services that respectively deliver the same kind of function. For example,  
ZapaMex has a simple manufacturing setup, so the more visible part of its  
main transactions – the “during” part – would look like this\:  
•  
Supplier channels\: Warehouse inbound – materials and  
components come in through the warehouse.  
•  
Value creation\: Production floor – materials  
and components are made into shoes on the  
production line.  
93 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
•  
Customer channels\: Warehouse outbound – completed  
shoes are despatched as end products via the  
warehouse.  
Note that although in that ZapaMex example, the inbound and  
outbound channels went through the same warehouse, the channels  
have different functions, and it’s extremely important to keep those  
functions apart even if they share the same location.  
One of my clients – an engineering research establishment – found  
this out the hard way. Everything came in and out through the one  
warehouse; and their method for deciding which way anything  
was going relied on a risk-prone mix of paperwork and guesswork.  
Eventually, as one might expect, the system failed spectacularly. A  
truck driver came by during a lunchbreak with a large aircraft part  
for testing. No one was around, so he dumped it in the middle of the  
warehouse bay. One of the laborers came back from his meal, saw  
the seemingly used-looking part lying on the floor, assumed that it  
was scrap, and dumped it in the trash metal bin, which was duly  
picked up a short while later. By the time the researcher called by to  
check whether his irreplaceable quarter-million-dollar aircraft part  
had arrived, it was long gone – and despite many frantic days of  
searching at every scrap merchant in the city, and even every rubbish  
tip, the part was never found. After that fiasco, the warehouse was  
provided with clearly marked “In” and “Out” sections on the floor.  
94 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
Yet for any service, we also need to remember what has to happen  
before the main transactions can occur. For ZapaMex, that “before” part  
would look something like this\:  
•  
Supplier relations\: Procurement – researching and  
acquiring new materials and components.  
•  
Value proposition\: Product development – develop and  
market new products, in line with the overall vision and  
values of the shared enterprise.  
•  
Customer relations\: Sales – point-of-sale activities and  
customer service.  
And then there’s also everything that needs to happen after the  
main transactions. For ZapaMex, that “after” part would look something  
like this\:  
•  
•  
•  
Value outlay\: Accounts payable – paying suppliers for  
materials and components.  
Value governance\: Line management – ensure accounts  
balance and keep everything on-track to enterprise and  
organizational success criteria.  
Value return\: Accounts receivable – receive payment for  
shoes from customers.  
When we bring all of that together, we could summarize the core  
services for ZapaMex in an Enterprise Canvas layout as shown in  
Figure 8-3.  
95 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
Figure 8-3. Simplified example\: ZapaMex shoe manufacturing  
Remember that this generic structure will apply to any service – every  
scope and scale, any type of content or context, and so on. In modeling  
at the Row-3 Service Model level, it’s likely that the first service or “Self”  
that we’ll work with will be the organization as a whole, or perhaps some  
specific department or business unit within the organization. But as we  
start to look in more detail – and especially as we work downward into  
Row-4 Design Model and Row-5 Deployment Model – we’ll use this same  
structure to explore the services that make up the more visible “business  
services” that we see as services at the larger scale. In that sense, every  
service has the same overall pattern, even though every service is also  
different from any other. This structure gives us a consistent frame with  
which to compare every type of service at every level of decomposition.  
We can also think of this nine-cell pattern as a kind of functional  
decomposition in its own right\: each of these “cells” delivers its own  
services to the entity and could thus, recursively, be represented by and  
described on its own Enterprise Canvas.  
And as we saw back in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,” we can also  
describe each service entity in terms of a spectrum between most abstract  
96 Chapter 8 Service Structure  
\(the enterprise as a whole\) to most concrete \(the detailed past\). We design  
and implement a service by moving “down” the layers; we redesign and  
rethink by moving “up.” As we move “down” toward the real world, we’ll  
usually need to add more and more detail – but in essence it’s still the  
same overall service, or rather a more specific implementation of that  
service. We’ll explore this in more depth later, in Chapter 13, “Service  
Content.”  
#  Into Action  
With the big-picture context for your business-transformation project  
established through the work of your previous sessions, you now have a  
free rein to move deeper into the “How.” You want to encourage your teams  
to use a consistent approach to how they model and describe services,  
and the relationships, responsibilities, products, exchanges, and flows that  
link between them. In these sessions with team leads and change teams,  
you’ll recommend that they should use Enterprise Canvas everywhere as a  
template and checklist for that purpose. Use the ideas in this chapter and  
the following questions to help you guide those conversations\:

of the service do its work? What resources does it need  
to do this? In what locations does it do it? What events

What real-world services or business functions  
implement the Value Return work of this overall  
service?

Chapter 8 Service Structure  
What real-world services or business functions appear  
to bridge two or more cells of the Enterprise Canvas?  
What does this show you in terms of the real-life  
partitioning of the work? What risks – if any – does this  
specific partitioning entail?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we saw how to make sense of what services need to do,  
by partitioning the service itself into a simple standardized pattern of a  
three-by-three matrix\: a time-related axis of before, during, and after, and  
a direction-related axis of inbound, this service, and outbound. Each cell  
represents a distinct and discrete set of activities and viewpoints for the  
service as a whole.  
In the next chapter, we explore the flows that connect between the  
various players and their respective services across the overall shared  
enterprise.  
101 CHAPTER 9  
# Service Flows  
To understand the value web that is the shared enterprise, we need to pay  
as much attention to the value flows between services as to the services  
themselves. Value creation takes place inside a service, whereas value flow  
bridges the gaps between services. As we’ll see later, each flow consists  
of its own mix of products and other types of assets and resources, to be  
exchanged in various ways between the respective services.  
This applies not just to whatever service that is our current focus of  
attention, but also to each cell within the respective Enterprise Canvas  
frame. Each of these has its own distinct set of flows, which we’ll explore in  
four parts\:  
•

•  
•  
Main transaction flows with other services – see this  
chapter.  
Information flows for service management – see later in  
this chapter.  
Guidance flows – see Chapter 10, “Service Guidance.”  
Investor-management flows – see Chapter 11, “Service  
Investors and Beneficiaries.”  
We’ll explore how to identify the detailed content for each of these  
flows in Chapter 13, “Service Content.”

103 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
#  Main Transaction Flows  
These flows form the most visible transactions and interactions of the  
service. It’s useful to separate these into the “before,” “during,” and “after”  
phases of transaction, because those phases are often handled by different  
groups of people or different sub-services within the overall service. And as  
we saw in the previous chapter, there are also some important differences  
in the emphasis of each of those types of flow\:  
•  
“Before” flows link primarily with supplier/customer  
relations and must always be regarded as bidirectional.  
•  
“During” flows link primarily with supplier/customer  
channels; while there are always some bidirectional  
components, the main flow is along the supply chain –  
in other words, left to right in the Enterprise Canvas  
diagram.  
•  
“After” flows link primarily with value outlay/return;  
while there are always some bidirectional components,  
the main flow is opposite to the supply chain – in other  
words, right to left in the Enterprise Canvas diagram –  
hence, “return channel.”  
We can summarize these differences visually as shown in Figure 9-1.  
104 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-1. Flows\: pre-transaction, transaction, post-transaction  
We also need to view these flows in terms of the market model and  
market cycle that we explored in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market.”  
A transaction takes place within the context of a market, which itself takes  
place within the context of a shared enterprise. The market sets the rules  
for transactions; the shared enterprise provides the reasons and purpose  
for transactions.  
Before the service can enact any transaction, it needs to establish that  
it’s in the right market, following that market’s rules. To do that, it needs to  
engage in conversation with a potential supplier or customer. But before  
it can do that, it needs to create a relationship with that prospect, to gain  
sufficient respect to bring them into the market; and to do that, it needs  
first to establish reputation and trust that the service shares the same  
overall aspirations – in other words, is in the same shared enterprise.  
Hence, there are many often-subtle interactions that need to take place  
before there’s any chance of a profitable transaction.  
105 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
It should be self-evident that this applies at the whole-  
organization scale, yet it also applies right down at the detail-  
level too. A cloud-based web service must likewise establish  
“conversation” with a potential transactor, to identify the appropriate  
interface protocol and the like; and where financial transactions are  
involved, must also establish trust that appropriate payments will  
be made.  
Moving outward a level or two, firewalls, public-key encryption,  
and the like are used to establish boundaries of trust. And further  
out, there will be a real person somewhere who makes the design  
decisions that permit the web services to establish their automated  
versions of mutual respect and trust. These interactions are not just  
“overhead,” because without them the transaction would not take  
place at all.  
For the market and enterprise to succeed, the transactions and  
interactions also need to be profitable to all parties involved – not solely to  
the service in focus. \(Note too that “profit” will be defined by the nature of  
“value” in the enterprise and will usually be much broader than monetary  
terms alone.\) Hence, as shown in Figure 9-2, there will need to be closure  
at the end of each interaction or transaction, to ensure that that balance is  
achieved and trust overall is reaffirmed.  
106 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-2. Enterprise and market cycle  
The Supplier Channels and Customer Channels manage the main  
transaction flows of the supply chain, and the Value Return and Value  
Outlay cells deal with the main returned value coming back in the  
reverse direction along the same pathway. But we need to be aware that  
there’s much more to the service flows than just those two out-and-back  
interactions, and we also need to take care that the other parts of the  
overall flows are not dismissed as unnecessary “overhead.” The same  
applies to the Supplier Relations and Customer Relations cells that manage  
most of the “before-transaction” flows and to the Value Return and  
Value Outlay cells that deal with the remainder of the “after-transaction”  
flows – yet each of these also needs to work with all of the other cells on  
that side of the respective service in order to ensure correct closure of the  
market cycle.  
To make it work, we need to expand the “completions” section at the  
end of the market cycle to make a distinct completion for each of those  
“before” steps, so that the activities and flows for each “before-action” step  
can be matched up with their own respective “after-action” completion.  
The resultant step-by-step, symmetric Service Cycle, as shown in  
Figure 9-3, will work not just at the market level, as in the market cycle, but  
for every type of interaction between services.  
107 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-3. Service Cycle – before, during, and after, step-by-step  
The Supplier Relations and Customer Relations cells establish  
connection with prospects by communicating the service’s value  
proposition, which also links the service to its market \(via the offer  
embedded in the value proposition\) and to the shared enterprise \(via  
vision and values\). One of the key functions of these “before-transaction”  
flows is to establish that prospective suppliers and customers also align  
to the vision and values of the shared enterprise – because if they don’t,  
problems will almost certainly ensue further down the line.  
Note that for this purpose, it’s often useful to have a published  
guide to business principles, to which the service asserts that it will  
adhere and to which it expects all players – *including itself* – will  
be held accountable. As Shell once put it in their “General Business  
Principles,” “We are judged by how we act – our reputation is  
upheld by how we live up to our core values”\: an explicit published  
document about principles will help to provide clarity where it is often  
much needed!  
108 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
For our fictitious company ZapaMex, it would no doubt be easy for its  
production team to think only in terms of the supply-chain transactions,  
and ignore everything else, as shown in Figure 9-4.  
Figure 9-4. Production view of service flows  
Line management, however, would insist that some attention should  
be paid to monetary flows; and sales, marketing, and procurement would  
all have their say as well – in other words, a market view, as shown in  
Figure 9-5.  
Figure 9-5. Market view of service flows  
Yet ZapaMex will need to think beyond just that basic transaction-oriented  
view of the market\: it also needs to build trust and gain respect,  
within the market and beyond. A focus on values, for example, would  
guide any discussions with suppliers or customers about material quality,  
because the values define what “quality” is within the enterprise. In the  
same way, ZapaMex needs to ensure proper closure in terms of the Service  
109 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Cycle that underpins the market cycle – otherwise its reputation will be at  
risk, and the market with it. From that perspective, the full set of flows that  
ZapaMex will need to address will include all of those shown in Figure 9-6,  
and probably more.  
Figure 9-6. Enterprise view of service flows  
When we assess the flows of a service in an Enterprise Canvas, we  
need to be clear which kind of scope we’re working with and to ensure the  
completeness of the picture in each case.  
#  Information Flows for Service Management  
Another key type of flow we need to consider is the information flows  
between services in a service hierarchy. We can illustrate this with a  
simplified view of a service that creates a new account, shown in BPMN  
process-model notation in Figure 9-7.  
110 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-7. process diagram  
Simplified account-creation service as BPMN  
These diagrams are common enough in solution architectures, but in  
essence they only describe the basic transaction flows and, if we’re lucky,  
some aspects of the flows in the return channel. What these diagrams  
very rarely describe is the context of the service – especially its reporting  
relationships up and down the service hierarchy and its coordination with  
other services. To understand the service, we need to know not just its  
transactions, but also how it would be managed, what performance criteria  
it should report, and where those reports should be sent, as indicated in  
Figure 9-8.  
111 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-8. Context for simplified account-creation service  
The same would be true of this service’s links with its “child” services  
“Verify Details” and “Create Account Record”\: they too would need to  
share requirements and performance information with their “parent”  
service. In Enterprise Canvas, we show these flows as a vertical double  
arrow, as illustrated in Figure 9-9.  
112 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
Figure 9-9. Service-management information flows  
In essence, these flows are usually the responsibility of the Value-Governance  
cell, so although the flows may move both “upward” and  
“downward” in the service hierarchy, often only the lower double arrow  
is shown.  
Note that the space for the upper link may already be occupied  
anyway if links to guidance services are also shown on the Enterprise  
Canvas – see Chapter 10, “Service Guidance.”  
We’ll explore the methods for assessment of detailed content for all of  
these flows in more depth in Chapter 13, “Service Content.”  
113 Chapter 9 Service Flows  
#  Into Action  
In the previous sessions with your team leads, they have agreed that they’ll  
use Enterprise Canvas to guide design decisions across the whole of your  
business-transformation project. For the next stage, you’ll want them to  
go deeper into how to describe the details of transactions and interactions  
between services, using Enterprise Canvas’ Service Cycle as a template and  
checklist. Use the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help  
you guide those conversations.  
#  Main Transaction Flows  
•  
•  
•  
What flows form the main transactions of the service?  
What is carried in these flows and in what sequence?  
What value is added to the overall transaction flow by  
this service? From which supplier does each incoming  
flow derive? To which customer is each outgoing flow  
directed, and how? Who is responsible for each of these  
flows, both incoming and outgoing?  
What flows form the return channel for each main  
transaction? What is carried in these flows and in what  
sequence? From which customer does each incoming  
return flow derive? To which supplier is each outgoing  
return flow directed, and how? Who is responsible for  
each of these flows, both incoming and outgoing?  
What return value is captured from the return channel  
by this service for its own use? What governance is  
applied to this value capture? What measures are taken  
to ensure that this capture is aligned with the values of  
the overall shared enterprise?

appropriate “parent”? What value is added to the  
organization, the market, and the overall enterprise by  
each flow? Who is responsible for each of these flows?  
What flows form the “downward” linkage between this  
service and any “child” service in the service hierarchy  
or management hierarchy? What is carried in these  
flows and in what sequence? What methods are used

to ensure that each flow is directed to the appropriate  
“child”? What value is added to the organization, the  
market, and the overall enterprise by each flow? Who is  
responsible for each of these flows?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter, we applied the same kind of structure review to the flows  
that make up the relationships between services, to establish what needs  
to pass back and forth with each provider or client, before, during, and  
after each of their main transactions. We also reviewed the information  
and other assets that need to pass up and down the service-management  
hierarchy.  
In the next chapter, we explore the key support services that provide  
guidance to the service in focus, for direction on strategy, tactics,  
operation, and change, for coordination with other services, and for  
maintaining and improving the quality of service.  
116 CHAPTER 10  
# Service Guidance  
So far, we’ve explored how each service identifies its purpose within  
a broader shared enterprise and how it structures its tasks and its  
relationships with others in the overall flow of value around the enterprise.  
Yet each service will also need some form of guidance to connect with that  
wider world, and in practice – certainly in any organization much larger  
than a one-man band – each service will depend on other more-  
specialized services to provide that guidance.  
To make sense of this, it’s useful to come back to that notion of the  
organization as a “living system” rather than as a machine. For that living  
system to be “viable,” as a whole, within its broader context – a “Viable  
System,” as Stafford Beer described it – each of its services will need not  
just the ability to do its own tasks, but also must have some means to  
decide what it needs to do at each moment; to coordinate its activities  
with other services; to plan its future activities, its tactics, and strategy; to  
remember what it has done; and to use the knowledge to help it adapt to  
and improve its relationship with its own environment. Much of this needs  
to be done in coordination with others, to ensure that everything works  
together as a unified whole – and all of it “on purpose,” both on its own  
terms and in relationship with that broader enterprise. Few services will be  
able to do all of this on their own – and that’s where the guidance services  
come into the picture.

117 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
If we describe the service itself as a “doing” service or delivery service –  
because each service does or delivers something – then we can partition  
all of those other requirements into roles for three distinct categories of  
support services\:  
•  
Direction services that support decision-making,  
planning, and change and also provide links to other  
whole-of-system services such as finance, HR, and  
infrastructure.  
•  
Coordination services that link both within and beyond  
the organization, to enable the smooth flow of service  
and supply chains and also guide the coordination  
of change.  
•  
Validation services that monitor and maintain quality  
throughout the organization, support continuous  
improvement, and also help the development of skills,  
competence, and capabilities.  
Figure 10-1 provides a visual summary of the relationships between  
these different types of services and how some of them necessarily extend  
beyond classic notions of “management.”  
118 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
Figure 10-1. Four categories of services  
As a side note, those symbols used in Figure 10-1 are intended to  
match up with their equivalents in Stafford Beer’s “Viable System  
Model” or VSM, as mentioned earlier above\: the circle or rounded-  
corner box for delivery services, which aligns with the role of VSM’s  
“system-1”; the upward-pointing triangle for coordination services,  
which sort-of aligns with the role of VSM’s “system-2”; the square  
for management services, which aligns with the roles of VSM’s  
“system-3,” “system-4,” and “system-5,” and the downward-  
pointing triangle for validation services, which sort-of aligns with  
VSM’s “system-3\*.”  
That point is not important here, though\: for our purposes, they’re just  
symbols that we can use to identify those different service roles. For  
what it’s worth, VSM does actually provide some of the core theory  
119 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
behind Enterprise Canvas, but in practice we don’t really need to  
know any of that to *use* Enterprise Canvas, which is the main focus of  
this book.  
If you *do* want to know more about that underlying theory, see my  
book *The Service-Oriented Enterprise* – there’s a lot of detail in there  
about the relationships, parallels, and crossmaps between service  
modeling, service design, and VSM.  
Ultimately, all services have the same overall structure, because all  
of them deliver a service\: whichever way we might label or categorize  
them, in the end every service is a “delivery service.” In effect, the only key  
differences between services are in the value proposition for each specific  
service, the content that each service delivers, and perhaps in how it  
delivers that service and content; but the patterns of relationships within  
and between services always remain much the same.  
Yet the point about that need for external support still remains. Who  
or what will direct the service managers? Who or what will coordinate  
this service with other services? Who or what will ensure that quality is  
established and maintained? There’s not much for that that’s in the core  
nine-cell service structure as such\: and yet there’s a real need for some  
forms of support or guidance to make sure that all of those things do  
happen. Hence, although in principle every service is a “delivery service,”  
every service also needs the support of those three other key categories  
of service\: direction services, coordination services, and the validation  
services that help to create, maintain, and pervade quality throughout  
every part of the enterprise. Collectively, these other services provide the  
overall guidance support needed by every service.  
120 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
We might instead describe “direction services” as “management  
services,” though that can be misleading as their role is actually quite  
a bit broader than simple management of a business unit or service.  
An alternative term for “validation services” would be “pervasive  
services,” because while they do ensure that everything holds to the  
values of the chosen shared enterprise, they also need to pervade  
*everywhere* throughout the whole enterprise.  
The relationships between each of these three types of guidance  
services are that they are almost orthogonal to each other, as shown in  
Figure 10-2.  
Figure 10-2. Delivery service and its guidance services  
As described in the note about Viable System Model earlier, we  
represent delivery services with a circle or a rounded-corner  
rectangle; direction services with a square symbol; coordination  
services with an upward-pointing triangle; and validation services  
with a downward-pointing triangle.  
121 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
For Enterprise Canvas, we show the guidance services in relation to the  
service to be guided by linking them to the frame of the overall “delivery  
service,” with the frame shown in Figure 10-3 as a dotted line around the  
standard nine-cell Canvas.  
Figure 10-3. Guidance services and nine-cell Canvas  
Note that each of these will attach at the respective layer or “row,” as  
described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers.” The same layering and recursion  
will apply to these services too, from most abstract \(Row–0 Enterprise\) to  
most concrete \(Row-6 Action Records\).  
Each of these services also has their own flows that pass between them  
and the service in focus in the Enterprise Canvas. Each type of guidance  
service also has its own emphases within the cells of the Enterprise  
Canvas, as shown in Figure 10-4.  
122 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
Figure 10-4. Emphases of the guidance services  
With the exception of some of the coordination services, few of  
these services have much direct or immediate impact on the day-to-day  
running of most of the delivery services – they’re more in-the-background  
rather than in-your-face. Their real role is to assist in the dynamics of  
services – the ways in which the services can, may, and must change over  
time to adapt to changing context and to align more strongly with the  
enterprise vision.  
123 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
#  Direction Services  
Direction represents the management services that provide oversight of  
the direction and operation of the unit and also guide how the service may  
need to change over time. In turn, these services are split into three distinct  
categories\:  
•  
Policy, purpose, and identity\: Long-term view to  
“develop the business” for the unit  
•  
Strategy and context \(“outside/future”\)\: Near-future  
view to “change the business” for the unit  
•  
Direction and tactics \(“inside/now”\)\: Immediate focus  
to “run the business” for the unit  
Within the nine-cell Enterprise Canvas frame, the “inside/now”  
group of direction services connect most strongly with the Value-Creation  
cell and, even more, the Value-Governance cell and from there to Value  
Outlay and Value Return. As local management, Value Governance does  
have a natural tendency to look to the past – the “bean-counters” – or at  
best to include the near future for local planning purposes with a view  
that’s tightly constrained to local needs. The role of the direction services  
is to connect the governance of this service to the big picture and to the  
present and future direction of the enterprise as a whole. The “strategy and  
context” and “purpose, policy, and identity” groups of support services  
probably connect most strongly to the Value-Proposition cell, with its  
emphasis on future rather than present or past.  
From the perspective of a single delivery service, there will usually be  
only one overall set of these direction services attached to it. Much as in  
a classic organizational hierarchy, though, a “run the business” direction  
service will typically provide guidance for several delivery services, often  
be shared across different levels; a “change the business” direction service  
124 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
will typically cover an entire business silo, such as marketing, finance,  
or IT; and a single “develop the business” direction service will provide  
guidance for the entire organization, and sometimes beyond.  
In our ZapaMex example, the “purpose, policy, and identity”  
direction services are mostly the responsibility of the executive board,  
with support from their immediate teams in making these decisions and  
distributing them throughout the organization as a whole. The “strategy  
and context” direction services are provided on one side by the strategy  
team, working with the change team, and on the other by the marketing  
team. The “direction and tactics” direction services are provided by middle  
management and line management, following the management hierarchy  
all the way down to the front line.  
#  Coordination Services  
Coordination represents the coordination services that link units together  
to create webs of cross-functional processes as required. As with the  
“direction” services, these can be split into three distinct categories\:  
•  
Develop the business\: Coordinate portfolios of longer-  
term change across units – also provides cross-  
functional bridge between direction’s “policy purpose  
and identity” and “strategy and context”  
•  
Change the business\: Cross-functional coordination  
of change projects – also provides cross-functional  
bridge between direction’s “strategy and context” and  
“direction and tactics”  
125 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
•  
Run the business\: Cross-functional coordination of  
run-time processes – also provides cross-functional  
bridge between direction’s “direction and tactics” and  
the unit’s own processes and interfaces, connecting  
everything end-to-end along the organization’s part of  
the respective supply chain and value web  
Within the nine-cell Canvas frame, these connect most strongly with  
Value Creation and the “supply-chain” interfaces – Supplier Channels  
and Customer Channels. Value Creation has a natural tendency to focus  
only on the here-and-now, on doing the same things the same way to  
maximize local efficiency and reliability without concern for whole-system  
effectiveness. The coordination services ensure that this service  
is connected to others as required at run time and is also connected to  
organizational and enterprise change.  
There’s often only one organization-wide “develop the business”  
strategy-coordination service, though a variable number of “change the  
business” services, dependent on the organization’s portfolio/project-management  
mix. There will be a large number of “run the business” links,  
often forming a complete “shadow network” that is almost invisible to the  
standard hierarchy.  
In ZapaMex, the portfolio development, product development, and  
strategy teams work together on the “develop the business” tasks, reporting  
directly to the executive board. The overall change group, consisting of  
the project managers, project leads, and architecture teams, do the bulk of  
the “change the business” work, though they also do some coordination  
with the marketing and procurement teams. The “run the business”  
coordination work is done by line managers and team leads, with support  
from IT systems as appropriate, some occasional help from architects and  
like, and also a few people with often-blurry job titles who wander around  
in the background between the departments and silos and keep everything  
working together across the whole.  
126 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
#  Validation Services  
Validation represents the broad range of support services that underpin  
overall governance and that guide the organization toward ever-stronger  
alignment with the enterprise vision and values such as safety, security,  
efficiency, and so on. These services need to touch every part of the  
organization, without exception, ultimately as part of the background  
ethos, culture, and collective habits – hence, that alternate label of  
“pervasive services.” As with the other guidance services, these types of  
support services can be split into three distinct categories\:  
•  
Develop awareness\: Advertise and evangelize to create  
awareness of the importance of the respective values  
and their practical implications.  
•  
Develop capability\: Educate in practices and metrics to  
implement and monitor compliance to the enterprise  
values via their derived principles, etc.  
•  
\(Use that developed awareness and capability to  
take action at run time, to support the value as an

Verify and audit\: Review records and lessons learned to

Within the nine-cell Canvas frame, these connect most strongly with  
the Value-Proposition cell. From there, they link with the “relations” cells –  
Supplier Relations and Customer Relations – to “spread the word” outward  
to the supply chain, the market, and the broader enterprise. Internally,  
though, they must link with and become embedded in every cell of the  
service.  
In principle, there should be one matched set of these services,  
organization-wide, for each key value of the enterprise, such as safety,  
security, quality, innovation, knowledge-sharing, and the like, depending  
127 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
on the vision and values of the enterprise and of the organization itself.  
There will usually be a distinct quality team for each of those respective  
values and provide the respective services as appropriate. Note, though,  
the real purpose of those validation services is to reaffirm that upholding  
the respective value is ultimately everyone’s responsibility – not solely that  
of the respective quality team.  
The full set of services needed will be different for every enterprise,  
aligning with the different needs and different values of the respective  
enterprise. Note that for some values such as financial probity or  
occupational health and safety, various laws or other constraints may  
mandate that the “verify and audit” services should or must be kept  
separate from the respective “develop awareness” and “develop capability”  
services.  
For ZapaMex, the highest-priority value concern is health and safety –  
the company has a proud record of one of lowest injury rates in the  
industry, and is keen to maintain that reputation. The next priorities are  
its product quality, its relationships with customers, suppliers, and others,  
and in creating a culture of continual improvement in everything that they  
do. There’s also a focus in the society as a whole about business ethics and  
financial probity, so those need to be addressed as well.  
Within ZapaMex, the “develop awareness” aspects for each of  
these concerns are tackled in on-boarding of new staff and the like, in  
conversations with suppliers and with government, in marketing materials  
and customer-service channels, and in business reports both outside and  
inside the company. For “develop capability,” training on health and safety  
and on business ethics is provided by external specialists, whereas training  
on the other values is mostly done in-house; in the manufacturing areas,  
the team leads maintain a continuous watch for potential hazards and  
are quick to help staff learn how to resolve production problems in ways  
that can avoid unsafe practices. For “verify and audit,” much of “verify and  
audit” is done by external services, particularly for equipment safety and  
128 Chapter 10 Service Guidance  
financial review; in each case, though, the reviews are also assessed by the  
quality teams and change teams, working together to look for any options  
to support further improvements on the respective quality concerns.  
#  Into Action  
In the next sessions with the team leads of your business-transformation  
project, you want them to show how they’ll ensure that every service  
will have the right management and governance, coordination with  
other services, and strategic oversight and coordination of change. You’ll  
recommend that they should use the “guidance-services” section of  
Enterprise Canvas as a template and completeness checklist. Use the  
ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help you guide those  
conversations.

#  Summary  
In this chapter we noted that no service stands alone\: it always exists  
within a broader context and needs to be connected with other support  
services that can provide guidance and governance to link the service into  
its place in that context. These support services also help to coordinate  
it with other services, provide direction on future change, and keep  
it on track with enterprise values. We saw how to identify the various  
types of these support services that each service will need, the roles they  
play relative to the service in focus, and how to model the respective  
relationships in Enterprise Canvas.  
In the next chapter, we explore how a service connects to and interacts  
with its investors and beneficiaries.  
133 CHAPTER 11  
# Service Investors  
# and Beneficiaries  
Another set of flows that we will often need to include in our service-  
design assessment are those that link the service with its investors and  
beneficiaries\:  
•  
•  
•  
Investors provide an investment of some value in  
order to help get the service started or to maintain its  
operations, in ways or forms that are distinct from and/  
or cannot be provided by either the main “horizontal”  
value flow nor the guidance services.  
Beneficiaries receive some value as a benefit or dividend  
from the operation of the service, in ways or forms that  
are distinct from and/or cannot be provided by either  
the main “horizontal” value flow nor the guidance  
services.  
Appropriate balance needs to be maintained in the  
relationship between investor flows and beneficiary  
flows – between what comes in and what goes out.  
The simplest example of this is monetary investment in a company\:  
•  
As an investor, someone invests money in the  
company.

135 Chapter 11 •  
•  
Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
As a beneficiary, that person receives a monetary  
dividend or repayment from the company – the “return  
on investment.”  
In terms of balance, there’s usually an expectation that,  
in compensation for taking on some of the financial  
risk, the monetary return to the investor will be greater  
than the initial investment – that the person will receive  
more money out than they paid in.  
ZapaMex is a privately owned company\: as investors, the founders  
provided most of the start-up funding and took on most of the  
financial risks to get everything started; and they and their families,  
as beneficiaries, retain much of the financial return.  
From time to time, the company’s owners have also taken out bank  
loans, such as to pay for new facilities and equipment to support the  
company’s growth. For the duration of each loan, the bank has thus  
been a financial investor, receiving payment both in interest charges  
and other fees, and in the eventual repayment of the loan.  
Note, though, that this is often about far more than merely money  
alone. These are value flows, so just as we’ve seen with the main  
“horizontal” value chain from supplier to self to customer, any form of  
value can bridge across that flow\: money, goods, information, connections,  
reputation, access to services, whatever. The forms of value received from  
investors and returned to beneficiaries are also not necessarily the same  
and in some cases can be very different indeed.  
136 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
At ZapaMex, the owners acknowledge that their staff are each  
investing a significant part of their lives in working with them toward  
the aims of the enterprise. In return, they offer benefits to their staff,  
not just in monetary form, such as wages and the like, but also in  
support for healthcare and product discounts for themselves and  
other members of their families – each of these non-monetary  
benefits being aligned to the enterprise values.  
In line with the country’s culture, ZapaMex has a strong focus on  
family. They acknowledge that the families of their staff are making  
another kind of investment, in family life disrupted by the absence of  
that staff member while they are away at work. Some of the benefits  
offered in return for this absence come in the form of wages and  
the like that are being shared with the family. The company do also  
organize “bring your child to work” days and whole-of-company  
family events, and offer training and priority for employment to family  
members.  
The outcome from this is that not only may the investors and  
beneficiaries for a service be different, but the content of the respective  
flows may be different too; and all of these may be different again for  
each of the different services with different roles at different levels of the  
organization’s services. This can make it challenging to find the right  
balance between investment and return across the enterprise – yet we do  
need to face that challenge in our work on service design, because there  
can be very real consequences to the organization and enterprise if we  
don’t get the balance right.  
To make sense of this, it’s best to explore the flows first and then tackle  
the question of balance once that’s done.  
137 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
#  Investor Flows and Beneficiary Flows  
In Enterprise Canvas, we model the main parts of these investor flows as  
an up arrow from Investor to Value Outlay and beneficiary flows as a down  
arrow from Value Return to Beneficiary. As we’ll see later when we explore  
that question of balance, both Investor and Beneficiary also connect to  
Value Governance, but we can skip over that for now.  
Conventionally, investors and beneficiaries are often described as the  
stakeholders or “owners” – which *is* valid, though it can sometimes  
become very complicated to explain this point once we start to  
look at the value flows in anything more than the most simplistic of  
monetary terms!  
Figure 11-1 provides a visual summary of how these flows relate with  
the core of the service itself.  
Figure 11-1. Flows\: investment and dividend  
138 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
In practice, an investor is a kind of supplier – but the flow usually goes  
the opposite way to what we would expect, feeding into the right-to-left  
return channel rather than the left-to-right main channel. Invested value  
is an input to the service, but often no further value will be added by the  
Value Creation of the service before it is sent onward to a supplier.  
As we’ve seen, the simplest example of this kind of investment is in  
monetary terms\: for example, a new business will typically need to buy in  
some supplies in order to be able to sell them onward with some form of  
added value. But since there are many kinds of value, there are also many  
other kinds of investment, which can include  
•  
Entrepreneurs provide a start-up with ideas,  
commitment, drive.  
•  
Friends and family provide entrepreneurs and  
employees with material, emotional, and aspirational  
support.  
•  
Business references or a government export certificate  
provides a new business with vital credibility in the  
marketplace.  
•  
A community invests sufficient trust to grant a social  
“license to operate.”  
•  
An analyst firm invests their personal reputation,  
status, and credibility when recommending the  
company as a suitable financial investment.  
•  
A customer does likewise in recommending the  
company’s products and services.  
139 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
For example, a ZapaMex customer makes a video about “unboxing”  
her newly delivered shoes, commenting on the quality of the  
packaging and presentation as much about the shoes themselves.  
Putting the shoes on, she comments on the look, the fit, the comfort,  
on how they make her feel – linking her to the enterprise vision of  
“helping your feet feel happy and healthy.” She then posts the video  
on the net for anyone to see.  
In doing all of this, she invests her effort, her trust, her own  
reputation, her pleasure in both the company and the ZapaMex brand.  
She’s not been paid to do this – the opposite, in fact, in that she has  
*paid* for the privilege to do all of these things. It’s therefore in the  
company’s interest to make sure that to her it continues to *feel* like a  
privilege, and that her investment has for her been worthwhile.  
Perhaps, the simplest way to explore investment is to identify the  
respective assets as a mix of the tetradian asset dimensions, as described  
in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market”\:  
•  
Physical\: Alienable “things” and tangible products from  
services  
•  
Virtual\: Non-alienable items such as ideas and  
information  
•  
Relational\: Person-to-person connection  
•  
Aspirational\: Personal commitment to an idea, belief,  
brand, or enterprise vision  
Note that others may have multiple roles relative to the service in  
this respect and may also invest multiple forms of value. A supplier who  
extends a financial line of credit to the company is investing both money  
140 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
and trust. That satisfied ZapaMex customer who tells her friends about  
how much she likes her new shoes is both a customer and an investor  
because she’s investing her own reputation in the company.  
The inverse may apply if a ZapaMex customer, for example, is not  
satisfied with their purchase\: they become an anti-client who “anti-invests”  
their reputation and their effort against the company, and will usually try  
to induce others to withdraw their investments too. In former times this  
usually didn’t matter all that much – a single complainant wouldn’t be  
able to do much on their own. But it now matters much more than it did,  
because in these days of social media, a single disgruntled customer can  
cause a lot of damage.  
Probably *the* textbook example of this is Dave Carroll’s song *United*  
*Breaks Guitars*. A professional musician, he became annoyed with  
United Airlines, having been given the run-around for almost a year  
by the customer-service department after his beloved Taylor guitar  
was damaged in baggage handling. He wrote a song about his  
troubles, which he and his band performed in a low-cost music video  
that they then posted up on YouTube.  
The song’s catchy tune and chorus and the bright, ironic humor of the  
video were enough to make it an instant Internet hit\: it passed  
the million-views mark in well under a week. Quickly becoming  
a lightning rod for anger at *all* airlines’ often customer-hostile  
“customer-service” systems, it appeared on national tv only a day or  
two after release; on international tv a day or two after that. United,  
caught completely off-guard, probably spent upward of \$20million in  
urgent damage control; the damage to brand was incalculable, but  
the incident certainly played a part in triggering a short-term hit of  
almost a billion dollars off their share value.  
141 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
The irony, of course, was that United could reasonably claim  
that none of it was their fault\: the initial incident fell into one of  
those awkward gray areas where many different organizations  
were involved and no one of them could be assigned exclusive  
responsibility to repair the damage. But no matter\: it was United that  
wore the blame – and the costs, in every sense.  
So don’t ignore the risks that your anti-clients can represent\: anyone  
could become one, for any reason, at any time, and any one of  
them could kill the company – yet you have no way at all to know in  
advance which one of them it might be.  
Many companies will acquire some of their anti-clients as a direct  
consequence of the nature of the work that they do\: oil drillers and miners  
opposed by environmental activists, for example, or a family-planning  
clinic challenged by those who hold opposing religious beliefs. In a sense,  
every competitor, of whatever kind, is an anti-client too, although that  
kind of anti-investment is to be expected and should be planned for from  
the start\: it shouldn’t much matter unless the competitor is able to incite  
a more general anti-client attack – as may happen often in politics, for  
example.  
Note that the only certain way to tackle the risk \(and opportunity\)  
represented by anti-clients is to go to the visible effort of building  
a reservoir of trust and reputation with the broader community. At  
some point you *are* going to have to draw on that reserve, and –  
courtesy of the naturally chaotic nature of real-world interactions and  
events – you have no way to know when or why that will be. One of  
the few proven tactics to do this is to build dialogue connections with  
the broader enterprise by being clear on your enterprise vision and  
142 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
demonstrating *by explicit action* that you hold yourselves accountable  
to that vision. The alternative is simply to sit and hope that nothing  
will happen\: not a wise move, as United Airlines discovered the  
hard way.  
Going the other direction, a beneficiary is a kind of customer, as the  
recipient of a benefit from the service. Again, though, the flow will usually  
go the opposite way to the usual customer flow, coming from the return  
channel rather than the main channel. Value here is an output from the  
service, but usually no value will have been added by the Value Creation of  
the service itself.  
As before, the simplest example is in monetary terms, such as a  
dividend payment to a stockholder. Once again, though, there are many  
other kinds of value that may be returned\: for example, the government  
gets payback for its export license in terms of enhanced credibility for  
the country as a whole, while the local community may see returns in  
terms of “good citizen” behavior by the business and also the wages and  
employment of its citizens supporting the local economy.  
#  A Question of Balance  
Most investors will expect some form of return on their investment,  
either direct or indirect. The complication here, as we’ve seen, is that  
the dividend may not necessarily take the same form of value as in the  
initial investment. Someone who invests time may expect to be paid in  
money; someone who invests money in a social project may simply want  
the satisfaction of seeing the job done well, with a good social outcome.  
You will see that there could be an almost infinite array of possible  
permutations in this.  
143 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
It’s therefore important to avoid any reliance on the usual overly  
simplistic notion of “double-entry life-keeping” and instead take care to  
identify what each potential investor’s expectations may be. Otherwise,  
again, there’s a risk of creating another dangerously disgruntled anti-client,  
where, with a little extra effort, we could instead have ensured strong  
satisfaction all round for everyone.  
From a simple monetary perspective, especially in a commercial  
context, the investors and beneficiaries will often seem to be the same –  
the stockholders or shareholders, for example, or the members of a  
cooperative. But in reality, and especially in a not-for-profit or government  
context, they will often be different, at least in terms of a money-only  
calculation. In addition, as we’ve seen above, invested value and returned  
value may take on very different forms\: a financial investment may be  
returned in a form such as reputation or social standing. In many cases,  
simple book-keeping may be more of a hindrance than a help.  
Whichever way we may choose to do it, it is always essential that the  
various “books” balance up in some appropriate way. Often the key test  
criterion is simply that the investor feels satisfied with the effective return  
on their investment – in whatever form each of those investments and  
returns may take. The result, though, is that achieving that proper balance  
across all forms of investment can sometimes be anything but simple.  
144 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
Figure 11-2. Investors and beneficiaries\: maintaining the balance  
In the Enterprise Canvas, as shown in Figure 11-2, most of this work  
will fall to the Value-Governance cell. There will often need to be distinct  
activities and flows associated with that cell – such as an investor-  
relations unit, for example. \(Note again, though, that the actual task there  
will need to address all investors and forms of investment – not solely  
monetary forms.\) These flows will need to link both to investors and to  
beneficiaries – who, once again, may in many cases be different people.  
And a major focus is not just to maintain appropriate relations with all  
of these stakeholders, but to ensure also that an appropriate balance is  
145 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
maintained on either side of the investment/dividend equation.  
As also shown in Figure 11-2, a strong link to the “direction” and, in some  
cases, the “validation” guidance services – see “Direction Services” and  
“Validation Services” in Chapter 10, “Service Guidance” – will help in  
keeping focus on the overall vision of the shared enterprise as the ultimate  
arbiter for decisions on balance.  
While unintentional imbalance will always create enterprise risk,  
deliberate imbalance can be downright lethal. Unfortunately, both of these  
can be all too common – in part because of the way in which financial  
investment is arbitrarily assigned a questionable automatic priority over all  
other forms of investment.  
As business commentator Charles Handy put it, the notion that  
the financial investors can purport to “own” other people’s lives is  
downright obscene – and yet at present that is often what actually  
happens in real business practice, because in many if not most  
organizations, the majority of their assets are intangible, residing in  
people rather than exchangeable “things.”  
The privileging of financial investment over all other forms also enables  
all manner of options to “game” the enterprise, from hostile takeovers  
to asset-stripping to overt dumping and worse. That such activities may  
technically be legal does not change the fact that in almost other any  
context, they would be classed as serious crimes\: and the point here  
is that every other investor in the enterprise will know it. In short, such  
game plays can create a time bomb for the overall enterprise, and at  
some point – as is already starting to happen in some cases – that  
bomb will eventually explode, with messy results all round. It’s likely  
that the only people who can take appropriate action on this are senior  
executives and lawmakers – and whether they will have the courage to  
bite the bullet on this is another question entirely. But in the meantime,  
146 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
this section of the Enterprise Canvas can help to surface serious  
concerns such as these\: and that at least will give us something to  
work with when the appropriate time comes.  
#  Into Action  
You want your team leads to understand that, for your business-  
transformation project, investment and benefit can take many forms and  
can apply to almost any type of service, even right down to the detail level.  
You’ll recommend that they should use the “investors and beneficiaries”  
section of Enterprise Canvas as a way to explore this in the service designs.  
Use the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help you guide  
those conversations.

and dividend, or between different investors and  
beneficiaries? Who or what is responsible for taking  
such action?  
Where such action to correct imbalances is prevented  
by current corporate law or other “external” forces,  
what else may be done to minimize damage to the  
overall enterprise?  
148 Chapter 11 Service Investors and Beneficiaries  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we saw that many services will require some form of  
investment to start them going; and some services also provide some form  
of value return to beneficiaries. Although stockholders and other “owners”  
are an obvious example of this at the larger scale, similar relationships  
can occur right down to the code level, with automated services. We also  
noted that investors and beneficiaries are not always the same, that the  
respective value flows may not be the same, and that we may need to take  
active measures to ensure a proper balance of value across the whole  
context.  
In the next chapter, we explore service decomposition, the way that  
services are often assembled from collections of other smaller and more  
focused services.  
149 CHAPTER 12  
# Service  
# Decomposition  
The Enterprise Canvas provides a kind of idealized view of the services of  
which the enterprise is composed, what each service does, and how they  
interconnect. In the real world, of course, few things match up exactly  
to that nominal ideal. In the upper layers of abstraction – above Row-3,  
Service Model – this should not matter at all; in fact most of the time there  
we should take some care to avoid paying too much attention to how  
things will work out in practice, or, especially, to what already exists.  
As we move downward, though, we do need to pay more and more  
attention to the various constraints and practicalities of the real world.  
In Row-3 we need to bounce back and forth between the “ideal” of the  
Canvas and the real-world services that either do or will implement each  
cell and flow of the Canvas, including the guidance services and the links  
with investors and beneficiaries.  
In Rows 3, 4, and 5, we also need to become much more explicit  
about the content and structure of each service and flow, and  
the Row-6 metrics for each, but we’ll look at those in more detail  
in Chapter 13, “Service Content” and Chapter 14, “Services as  
Systems.”

151 Chapter 12 ServICe DecompoSItion  
For example, for ZapaMex, the company may want to explore the  
options for its real-world Customer Channels, as shown in Figure 12-1. At  
present the company sells only through its retail stores, but would it be  
practical to do sales via direct mail as well? If so, what about phone sales,  
to complement the direct-mail order forms? In which case, what would be  
the cross-over with the existing customer-service call center – in what ways  
would those Customer-Relations services need to change? And what about  
e-commerce, via a web store? The company might plan to do that only in a  
year or so in the future, but it would be wise to think about those services  
now – especially as they would impact on the way we would handle  
Value-Return payments from the customer, and the Customer-Relations  
services too.  
Figure 12-1. services  
ZapaMex\: decomposition of Customer-Channels  
Each step in this process of service decomposition brings us closer  
to the real world. \(This detailed decomposition is often also known as  
describing the granularity of a service.\) Yet, as shown in Figure 12-2,  
each of these items is still also a service in its own right – and hence a  
candidate to model on its own Enterprise Canvas, complete with its own  
flows, guidance-service links and possibly its own service-specific links to  
investors and beneficiaries as well.  
152 Chapter 12 ServICe DecompoSItion  
Figure 12-2. Each cell is also a service in its own right  
In the same way, we can, and often should, apply the same  
decomposition to each of the cells within an Enterprise Canvas. Each cell  
is a service; hence, it also has its own subsidiary services and flows. This  
also means that there’ll almost certainly be flows between cells within an  
Enterprise Canvas, which we will likewise need to map in the same way as  
for any other service.  
In theory this decomposition could go on ad infinitum – but that’s  
a quick way to get stuck in “analysis paralysis,” so in practice we  
do need to know when to stop that analysis! The simplest guideline  
here is that we should aim always to do the *minimum* decomposition  
needed to make sense of the service, and stop as soon as we’ve  
reached that point.  
#  Into Action  
Your team leads in the business-transformation project will all be familiar  
with decomposition and granularity of services, but are likely to want a  
simple means to introduce their less-experienced team members to these  
concepts and practices. You could suggest that they might use the fractal  
“services-within-services” structure of Enterprise Canvas to illustrate this  
153 Chapter 12 ServICe DecompoSItion  
point, and to provide the templates and completeness checklists that they  
would need. Use the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to  
help you guide those conversations\:  
•  
•  
•  
What are the services within each cell of a service?  
What are the flows between each cell of a service?  
Going down into the detail of a lower-level Row if  
necessary, what are the cells and flows of each of these  
subsidiary cells of the service?  
What real-world services implement each service  
in a high-level Enterprise Canvas? How does the  
view change as you delve deeper into finer-grained  
partitioning of services?  
Which real-world services bridge between two or more  
of the cells in the idealized structure of the Enterprise  
Canvas? Why is it necessary that they should do so?  
What implications and trade-offs does this suggest for  
the service’s orientation \(to its suppliers, to its own  
value creation, or to its customer\) or its time focus  
\(future, present, or past\)?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we saw how and why, as we move more toward realization  
of the service, we’ll often need to split the generic descriptions in each  
Canvas cell into the more explicit “child” services and sub-services of  
which it is composed in real-world practice. We can use the Canvas with  
our stakeholders as a guide to elicit details about these “child” services –  
and, if appropriate, model each of them on their own Enterprise Canvas.  
In the next chapter, we explore more detail about service content – the  
various elements that enable the service to work as a service.  
154 CHAPTER 13  
# Service Content  
The previous chapters outlined the core principles for Enterprise Canvas  
as a service-design pattern, describing it in terms of overall structure and  
relationships, as if seen from the outside. To put it into practical use, we  
now need to look at the inside of each service and flow and the elements  
that make it work as a service.  
As with all previous chapters, we only address a single concept here\:  
the internal content of services and products. However, there is a lot that  
we need to cover in this one chapter. We need to address the differences  
between services and products, and how to describe service content in  
terms of three distinct dimensions\: content detail, content categories, and  
content types. The level and type of content detail that we need for our  
service models will change as we move from big-picture intent to strategy  
to plans to real-world operations, and we will use the Service-Layers  
model to provide guidance there. Later in this chapter, we will use the  
Service-Content model to provide guidance on content categories such  
as Asset, Function, Location, and so on, and on content types such as  
physical, virtual, and the like. And finally, we will need to explore how to  
bring all of these elements together to describe this single thing called “the  
service.”  
The shared enterprise is like a holograph\: every service ultimately  
connects with everything else. Hence, any assessment we do in any part of  
the enterprise implicitly contributes to the detail of everywhere else. And  
because everything ultimately connects with and depends on everything  
else in the enterprise, we can choose somewhere to start\: any service,

155 Chapter 13 Service Content  
anywhere, at any layer, any level, any item of content, any area of interest,  
any aspect of the organization or enterprise where something happens.  
We model only what we need for that specific task; then link the models  
together as required, and allow the overall detail to emerge over time  
through the layering and interconnections of the Canvas structure.  
The process for modeling is essentially the same in every case, whether  
we want to do an as-is, an as-was, or a to-be model for the respective  
service that is the focus of this Canvas. The key is to get started at all,  
and then let the Enterprise Canvas pattern guide us in how to connect  
everything together from there.  
#  Service and Product  
Before we go into the detail of service content, we need to do a brief  
exploration of the differences between services and products, their  
respective roles in the flow of value around the enterprise, and the  
differences in how we need to describe their respective content.  
A service represents where something happens in the enterprise,  
where value is created or changed; a product represents the current state  
of some aspect of value within the enterprise. A service is active, while  
a product is static; or to describe the difference in a shorthand form, a  
service does, whereas a product is.  
As described in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” any flows between services  
are realized as products\: products are the outputs of services, which then  
become inputs for other services. Note, though, there may be no actual  
“flow” as such\: in practice, that term really applies to only physical assets.  
For the other asset types, a flow is more implied than real\: for example, a  
change in a relational asset may be an outcome of one service, that is then  
referenced in another service, but the relational asset does not actually  
move in a physical sense between the two services.  
156 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Services have boundaries\: these may be boundaries of place or time,  
or where responsibility is passed from one agent to another, or just some  
point where we choose to place a boundary. Yet as shown in Figure 13-1,  
wherever there is a boundary or gap between services, then at least one  
product must exist there, to provide a means to bridge across that gap.  
Figure 13-1. Products bridge the gap between services  
As described later in this chapter, a service must be a complete  
composite of any appropriate mix of Assets, Functions, Locations,  
Capabilities, Events, and Decisions. In turn, as described in Chapter 12,  
“Service Decomposition,” a service may itself be assembled from any other  
appropriate “child” services, each of which is made up of its own mix of  
Assets, Functions, and so on.  
In the same way, a product may be assembled from any number of  
“child” products, each of which may be any appropriate mix of asset types.  
Unlike a service, though, a product can only be composed of Assets\: it  
cannot incorporate any of the other content categories. However, a product  
can represent or imply a service\: for example, an insurance product  
represents a promise of future service to be provided whenever certain  
conditions are met. A product may also embed Asset content that can be  
unpacked into a form that may then be used as a service\: for example, a  
smartphone app is a product that includes executable code that enables  
the app’s services when it is run.  
157 Chapter 13 Service Content  
The purpose of a product is to be used as an input to another service,  
often run by someone else\: for example, a ZapaMex shoe is intended for  
use in the new owner’s self-service of “to wear shoes.” We can use the  
existence of a product to identify the probable services in which it might  
be used.  
Note that a product may also be used in services that we may not  
have planned for or expect. This is known as an *affordance*, in  
that the product “affords” the possibility of that use. For example,  
a ZapaMex shoe may be intended for use in that “to wear shoes”  
service, but it could also be used in other purposes – and  
services – such as a door-stop or a decorative item on a shelf, or as a  
projectile to throw at a night-time caterwauling cat. This point about  
affordances can be important in some service-design issues such as  
identifying potential product liability and service risk.  
To summarize all of this\: In the flow of value around the enterprise, a  
service is where some aspect of that overall value is created or changed,  
whereas a product represents some aspect of value; a service does, a  
product is. In terms of service content, a service must always incorporate  
a complete set of the service categories, whereas a product can only  
incorporate elements of the Asset service-content category.  
#  Service Layers and Service Content  
The Service-Layers model, as described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,”  
plays a crucial role in identifying content for a service when modeling with  
Enterprise Canvas. This is because, for most purposes, each Enterprise  
Canvas will describe only a single service at a single layer of abstraction,  
in context of the flows and interchanges it shares with each of its  
158 Chapter 13 Service Content  
stakeholders. In that sense, the layer we choose for an Enterprise Canvas  
instance indicates the type of information and level of detail that needs to  
be acquired and modeled for that Canvas instance. Figure 13-2 shows the  
Service-Layers model, summarizing the content role and level of detail  
needed for each respective Row in that model.  
Figure 13-2. Service-Layers model – layers of abstraction  
Again, note that important point here\: in general, use only one layer  
for each Enterprise Canvas, and don’t mix layers. Each layer has a different  
role for architecture, design, deployment, and operations, and we would  
create architectural and other risks if we blur them together. By keeping  
the models separate and distinct at each service layer or Row, we can  
then link “downward” through the layers to build trails of derivation from  
most-abstract to real-world most-concrete, or link “upward” to build trails  
of provenance to show how action records and real-world services support  
and maintain the vision for the organization and the overall shared  
enterprise.  
159 Chapter 13 Service Content  
If we need to see how something changes across layers – such as going  
from Row-3 Service-Model to Row-4 Design-Model implementation  
design, for example, or from an actual Row-5 Deployment-Model  
implementation back up to Row-3 to rethink alternate options – then we  
should use a separate Canvas for each layer, and link them together via the  
respective service interfaces and flows, as described in Chapter 9, and/or  
via guidance-service oversights, as described in Chapter 10.  
Given that proviso, we can now explore the content to be acquired for  
each layer or Row.  
Row-0 Enterprise\: The only content for this layer is the enterprise  
vision, and, optionally, any enterprise-wide values, principles, standards,  
success criteria, and suchlike that devolve from that vision. These apply to  
all participants, services, and flows within the overall shared enterprise.  
Figure 13-3 shows the vision for the shared enterprise for ZapaMex and  
its market.  
Figure 13-3. Row-0 content  
Use the methods described in Chapter 4, “Service Vision and Values,”  
to derive that content for the service’s Row-0 “Enterprise.”  
Row-1 Scope\: For this layer, we need a summary of the content  
elements that would be needed to support the enterprise as a whole,  
and make it work for all of its participants and stakeholders. These  
elements would then be addressed and used as required in a value web of  
interlinked services that would each, in their own way, support the vision,  
values, standards, and success criteria of that shared enterprise.  
160 Chapter 13 Service Content  
As shown in Figure 13-4, the content elements would typically be sorted  
into a predefined set of categories such as the interrogatives What, How,  
Where, Who, When, and Why.  
Figure 13-4. Row-1 content realizes Row-0 vision  
Use the methods described in Chapter 6, “Service Actors and Other  
Entities,” to derive that content for the service’s Row-1 Scope.  
Row-2 Business Model\: For this layer, the content that we need would  
be drawn from the Row-1 Scope layer, but packaged in two different forms.  
The first is a model of roles and relationships between those roles – in  
essence, services, and products that move between them – that, across  
the whole, cover all of the content from Row-1. In effect, this Row-2  
model outlines all elements of business that should or must occur within  
the overall shared enterprise. This “enterprise business model” for the  
ZapaMex example is shown in Figure 13-5.  
161 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Figure 13-5. Row-2 content for shared enterprise  
The second form of Row-2 Business Model represents the subset of  
that Row-1 Scope content as seen from the perspective of one participant  
or role within that overall shared enterprise. Figure 13-6 shows the high-  
level business-model relationships for ZapaMex itself.  
Figure 13-6. shared enterprise  
Row-2 content for ZapaMex as one player within its  
162 Chapter 13 Service Content  
In both forms, services realize any appropriate subset of Row-1  
elements, whereas flows realize an appropriate subset of the “What”  
column in the Row-1 elements. Use the methods described in Chapter 7,  
“Service Roles and Relationships,” to derive the content for any required  
views for the services’ Row-2 Business Model.  
Row-3 Service Model \(also known as “logical model”\)\: For this layer,  
the content we need is an abstract overview of the internal workings of the  
service and of the flows that pass between services.  
A typical first step would be to apply decomposition, to derive a set of  
“services-within-services,” with implicit flows between them. In Enterprise  
Canvas, we start this decomposition with a “horizontal” split between  
service for inbound, core and outbound, and a “vertical” split for before,  
during, and after the main transactions along the value chain, as described  
in Chapter 8, “Service Structure.” This gives us a standardized nine-cell  
initial decomposition, as shown in Figure 13-7.  
Figure 13-7. Row-3 content from initial decomposition  
We also need an overview for the content of the flows, as described in  
Chapter 9, “Service Flows.” This should include both external flows shared  
with suppliers, customers, and others, and flows between those internal  
services.  
163 Chapter 13 Service Content  
As shown in Figure 13-8, we also need to extend the same  
decomposition review “outward” to any “child” services of this service; to  
the flows shared with its support services, as described in Chapter 10,  
“Service Guidance”; and to the flows shared with any investors and  
beneficiaries, as described in Chapter 11, “Service Investors and  
Beneficiaries.”  
Figure 13-8. support services  
Row-3 content should include all “child” services and  
We can then repeat the same process to the various child services  
and flows, applying any further internal decomposition that may be  
needed there, to any required depth, as described in Chapter 12, “Service  
Decomposition.”  
164 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Note, though, that in Row-3 all of this is still at an abstract level\:  
we identify the type of service and flows required for each item in the  
decomposition, to detail how it is to be implemented.  
To find the content for this layer, we first expand out the overall set of  
service elements from Row-1 and Row-2, adapting them from the simple  
interrogatives of What, How, Where, and so on, into more real-  
world categories such as Asset, Function, Location, and the like, using the  
Service-Content model described in the next section of this chapter. We  
then apply those to the services and products we identified in our business  
models and service decomposition, to the level and type of detail required  
for this Row-3 Service-Model layer.  
For Zapamex, its Row-3 first-level decomposition would be as shown  
in Figure 13-9.  
Figure 13-9. external flows  
Initial Row-3 content for ZapaMex internal services and  
By asking broad questions about the nature of the service and its  
flows, we can derive useful ideas about content for specific cells and flows.  
For example, if we ask about what the service does, about the services,  
products, and/or other “deliverables” that this service creates through its  
work, that then gives us the role and content for the Canvas’ Value-  
Creation cell. If we ask about why the service does what it does, about  
the value that it creates and adds for each of its stakeholders and for the  
165 Chapter 13 Service Content  
enterprise as a whole, that gives us the role and content of the Value-  
Proposition cell and key aspects of the Customer-Relations, Supplier-  
Relations, Value-Outlay, and Value-Return cells, the “before” flows, the  
Validation, Investor, and Beneficiary flows, and interactions with the non-  
transactional stakeholders. And if we ask about who or what it works for,  
that it would relate with, actions it shares, whom or for what the service  
does what it does, and with whom or what it would relate, the transactions  
that share with others, that would give us the roles, content, flows, and  
interfaces needed for the Supplier-Channels and Customer-Channels cells,  
and the respective transaction stakeholders for those flows. We can gain a  
lot of useful information from those kinds of questions.  
Flows are realized as products – we will see more on that in the  
“Service and Product” section later in this chapter. Here in Row-3 we need  
to capture only a broad overview about the nature, role, and purpose for  
each of those products; later, in Row-4, Row-5, and Row-6, we will add  
further real-world detail about those products.  
For example, in ZapaMex’s Row-3 model, the main products for its  
“make shoes” Value-Creation service are matched pairs of completed  
shoes. These go to its Customer-Channels “store and make ready for  
shipment” service, whose products are cartons or crates of shoe-boxes  
placed into a vehicle for delivery to shops or customers, and the respective  
invoice and delivery docket for each of those items.  
Row-4 Design Model \(also known as “physical model”\)\: For this layer,  
the content we need is a more specific overview of the internal workings  
of the service and of the flows that pass between services. To derive this  
content, we do the same kind of process as for Row-3 Service Model, but at  
a more implementation-specific level of detail.  
For example, if ZapaMex decided in their Row-3 Service Model that  
they would need some kind of vehicle to move finished goods from the  
factory to their retail stores, here in Row-4 they would specify that the  
vehicle would be a mid-sized truck, and probably also identify the specific  
model of truck to be used.  
166 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Note too that, as shown in Figure 13-10, services may be implemented  
by any appropriate mix of people, machines, and IT. The same service may  
also need multiple ways to implement it, such as to cope with business  
continuity and disaster recovery; and those various implementations may  
often each need their own specific mix of people, machines, and IT.  
Figure 13-10. machines, and/or IT  
Row-4 content describes services provided by people,  
For ZapaMex, invoices to be sent out by its “store and make ready for  
shipment” Customer-Channels service may be sent out in either physical  
or electronic form. The Row-4 model needs to specify how these products  
are to be created, and also how delivery crews will know that a physical  
invoice will not need to be attached to a package if it has already been sent  
in electronic form.  
Row-5 Deployment Model\: For this layer, the content would be the  
exact detail needed for real-world operations, for services, products, and  
coordination between services. To identify and derive this content, we do  
the same kind of process as for Row-3 Service Model and Row-4 Design  
Model, but at an operations level of detail.  
For example, ZapaMex’s Row-3 model specified the need for a delivery  
vehicle, and Row-4 specified the make and model of mid-sized truck that  
they would use for this. Here in the Row-5 model, the delivery roster would  
167 Chapter 13 Service Content  
have to include the full details for each delivery, including the driver’s  
name or ID, the truck’s registration number, and the intended delivery  
route. There would then need to be a service that could prepare and  
present that delivery roster, with the roster itself as the product from that  
service.  
Row-6 Action Records\: For this layer, the content we need is about the  
outcomes of service operation. Where Row-5 will describe what is intended  
to happen, Row-6 represents what actually happened.  
Everything in this layer will be some kind of product – usually as  
information, but also other forms as well. In most cases these will be for  
internal use or reuse, though some will also go outward, such as for review  
by auditors and the like.  
In each case we will need to identify which service will create these  
products and also the intended recipient for each product – such as for  
procurement planning, “run the business” performance reviews, and  
“change the business” or “develop the business” strategy development.  
For ZapaMex, its Row-6 model for its Customer-Channels services  
would include a record of the actual driver, vehicle and route used for a  
delivery, and the packages loaded onto the vehicle at that time. These  
records would be used for pay calculation, delivery tracking, vehicle  
maintenance, insurance, and more. A physical product of the operations  
would be the internal pallet to be returned to the factory floor, or sent  
onward for repair.  
#  The Service-Content Model  
For each Row in the Service-Layers model, we need to describe the  
required detail in terms of the respective content categories and  
content types.  
The Row determines the content categories that we need for the  
respective stage of modeling. In Row-0, we only need the vision and  
168 Chapter 13 Service Content  
values; for Row-1, we can use simple interrogatives such as What, How,  
and Where; for Row-2, we begin to translate those interrogatives into real-  
world categories such as Asset, Function, and Location; in Row-3, Row-4,  
and Row-5, we will need to expand out our descriptions to include both  
content category and content type; and in Row-6, products are the only  
content, which must be comprised solely of Assets. Figure 13-11 provides a  
visual summary of these changes from layer to layer.  
Figure 13-11. Row-0 to Row-6 – content summary  
In Row-2, the interrogatives translate roughly as follows\: What  
becomes Asset; How becomes Function; Where becomes Location; Who  
becomes the agent for a Capability; When becomes Event; and Why  
becomes Decision.  
For most of that translation, there’s a close match between  
interrogative and content category, but there are some challenges  
around “*Who*” and “*How*.”  
169 Chapter 13 Service Content  
“*Who*” is shown above as the agent for a Capability, but note that an  
agent also be a machine or an it system. In practice, “Who” is also  
represented by the *relational* asset type, though people themselves  
should *never* be described as “assets” in an architecture or anywhere  
else\: *the relationship is the asset*, not the person. The relationship  
with the person creates the access to that person’s capabilities\: if the  
relationship is damaged or destroyed, almost all value will be lost,  
even if the person is physically present.  
“*How*” is shown above as matched with Function, because the  
function is the only visible part of the service’s “How” when seen  
from the outside. In practice, “How” is more of an emergent property  
from the way that all the various elements fit together and interact  
with each other – particularly Function and some aspects of  
Capability, but actually everything else as well.  
There’s also no distinct element for “Process” because, as with  
“How,” process is an emergent property, though more at the next  
level above\: not interactions between service elements, but between  
services themselves. What we call “process” is actually a sequence  
of service invocations, each stage adding toward a broader outcome.  
Those sequences may take almost any form, from predetermined, as  
often seen “hard-wired” into software, to free-form, as in many types  
of case management. In that sense, “Process” is itself just another  
kind of service, as a wrapper around other services.  
170 Chapter 13 Service Content  
The Service-Content model then links content categories with content  
types, as shown in Figure 13-12.  
Figure 13-12. Service-Content model  
There are two distinct sets of content types\: the asset-types set, used for  
Asset, Function, Location, Capability action \(including what the capability  
acts on\), Capability agent, and Event; and the decision-types set, used for  
Decision and for Capability skill levels.  
The asset-types set is as described in the market metaphor in Chapter 3,  
“Service Context and Market”\:  
•  
Physical “things”  
•  
Virtual items such as data and information  
•  
Relational links between real people  
•  
Aspirational links between people and abstract ideas,  
represented by brands, and also by morale, by values,  
and by the idea of the enterprise itself  
Figure 13-13 provides a visual checklist for asset types.  
171 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Figure 13-13. Asset types\: content for Row-3 to Row-6  
In the Service-Content model, *time* is an abstract asset type that is  
best understood as a *location*. While events do occur *in* time, time  
*itself* is not an event; and although time could be described as a kind  
of resource, it’s not an asset as such\: it can’t be possessed, it can’t  
be changed, and nor can it be directly exchanged for anything else.  
People often regard *money* as a special type of asset, but in  
architectural terms it’s best understood as an enumeration for a belief  
about value. In the Service-Content model, we would describe it as a  
composite of *virtual* and *aspirational*, representing information about  
a belief in future rights of access to assets.  
The decision types set describes levels of complexity. There is a close  
relationship between complexity levels for decisions and complexity levels  
for skills, so this set is used for both\:  
•  
Rule-based trainee-level decisions and skills  
•  
Algorithmic apprentice-level decisions and skills  
172 Chapter 13 Service Content  
•  
Guidelines and patterns for journeyman-level decisions  
and skills  
•  
Principle- and value-based master-level decisions  
and skills  
Figure 13-14 shows a visual summary for the decision types.  
Figure 13-14. to Row-5  
Decision types and skill types\: content for Row-3  
Note that the *decision-types* set is only used for Row-3 to Row-5; it  
is not relevant for Row-6, whose content consists solely of products,  
which can only be described in terms of *asset types*.  
Although not an exact match, the asset-type and decision-type sets  
do roughly align with each other and are shown as such on the Service-  
Content model. For example, a physical machine can only follow simple  
mechanistic rules; algorithms work well with virtual information.  
173 Chapter 13 Service Content  
The cells in the Service-Content model define a set of primitives, which  
we can then combine as required into composites. A primitive is something  
that can be defined or described in terms of a single cell in the model,  
whereas a composite straddles across cells. The links for a composite can go  
either vertically, horizontally, or both ways across the model, for example\:  
•  
Vertical composite\: Raw data is a primitive, a virtual  
asset, whereas a printed book is a physical “thing” that  
also contains information, and hence is a composite  
physical + virtual asset.  
•  
Horizontal composite\: A function provides an interface  
to change assets, yet cannot do anything on its own  
until combined with a capability – an ability to work on  
an asset type at a particular skill-level.  
•  
Combined composite\: A security capability is designed  
to protect specific types of assets, responding to any  
type of event with an appropriate type of decision.  
In terms of the Service-Content model, a service is a combined  
composite that, at run-time, must link together a complete set of  
assets, functions, locations, capabilities, events, and decisions, with any  
appropriate mix of the asset types and decision types for each.  
A composite should not be able to straddle framework layers – the  
Rows of the Service-Layers model – but that doesn’t concern us  
here, because we should only be working with a single Row at a  
time on any given Enterprise Canvas model. Note, though, that a  
design pattern *can* straddle more than one Row\: for example, in data  
architecture, a “many-to-many” data-relationship pattern in a Row-3  
service model would typically be shown in a Row-4 design model as  
implemented by a cross-reference table.  
174 Chapter 13 Service Content  
One of the main roles of service architecture is to apply abstraction –  
moving “upward” through the service-detail layers toward Row-0  
Enterprise – to split the real-world composites back into smaller  
composites and primitives, so as to enable reconfiguration and redesign  
into other, more effective “solutions” for the given context. Design and  
implementation go the other way, moving “downward” through the  
service-detail layers toward the “Now” between Row-5 as immediate  
future and Row-6 as the past. At that point, by definition, everything must  
be an “architecturally complete” composite across all the content-model  
columns, which we could summarize as  
•  
With Asset do Function using Capability at Location on  
Event because Decision  
“Architecturally complete” composites may use any appropriate mix of  
segments. For example, in ZapaMex’s Row-4 service-design model for its  
Value-Creation cell, the same nominal business function of “make shoes”  
might be implemented using a machine \(physical capability\), a manual  
process \(relational-linked physical capability\), or an IT-driven CNC system  
\(virtual-linked physical capability\). One of the keys to design for business  
continuity and disaster recovery is to structure the service functions such  
that one type of capability may be swapped for another at any time – such  
as a manual process that can take over when the regular IT system fails.  
Another key value of these distinctions between entity types is that it  
helps us identify additional services that we may need to include in our  
architectures. For example, consider a printed book in a library\:  
•  
It is a physical “thing”\: We will need services to manage  
it as a physical asset, with storage, location tracking,  
physical maintenance, and so on.  
•  
It contains virtual information\: We will also need  
services that manage it as a virtual asset, with possible  
concerns about copying and suchlike.  
175 Chapter 13 Service Content  
•  
•  
There are ownership relationships with various  
people, sometimes temporary \(as a library loan\), but  
maybe also nominally permanent \(as owned by the  
library\)\: We will probably need services to track those  
relationships.  
There are value relationships or meaning relationships  
with or for various people\: We might need services to  
track what people feel about the book in general, or  
even this specific copy.  
Or, to give another example, the location of a room within an office  
building\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
It has a physical location\: We will need our services to  
note the physical schemas that apply, such as geographic  
location, building floor, corridor position, and so on.  
It may have a virtual location\: We will need our services  
to note any virtual schemas that might apply, such as  
room ID, role ID, and suchlike.  
It will imply various relational locations\: We may need  
services that note who uses this office at this time, or in  
the past, or is listed to do so in the future; and/or where  
each of those people sit within the organizational  
architecture, or reporting relationships, or other  
relational schemas.  
It may imply meaning locations\: We might need to  
connect with “organizational-history” services if, for  
example, this was where a famous scientist worked,  
or where the first transistor was created, or where the  
treaty was signed.  
176 Chapter 13 Service Content  
The trap here is that all of this could easily go on to infinity, so we do  
need to remember always that core principle of Just Enough Detail. Start  
with the business need in mind, and then do just enough assessment to  
satisfy that need – no less, but also no more than that.  
** *Asset* Content Elements**  
Assets are resources for use in a service, and for which the respective  
service accepts and acknowledges responsibility. A product is likewise an  
asset for which the respective “owner” assumes responsibility.  
This point about responsibility is perhaps the key distinction between  
assets and generic “resources.” We will see more about that later in  
this chapter, in the section on “Cross-checks for Service Content.”  
Assets may be composed of any appropriate mix from the asset-types  
set\: physical, virtual, relational, and aspirational. An asset may also be  
represented by any composites between these types. Many real-world  
assets are composites in this sense\: for example, a key point in marketing  
is creating emotional attachment to objects – in other words, a composite  
asset of physical and aspirational.  
For ZapaMex, its physical assets include its buildings, furniture, shoe-  
making machines, shoe-making materials and completed shoes, and its  
delivery vehicles. Its virtual assets include the information that it uses  
to run its business, the content of its website, and the stories told by its  
customers. Its relational assets include its connections with employees and  
their families, suppliers, customers, recruiters, regulators, and many more.  
Its aspirational assets include its vision, values, reputation, and brand.  
Its composite assets include its CRM \(customer-relations management  
system\), which incorporates virtual information about relational assets,  
177 Chapter 13 Service Content  
and the point-of-sale displays in its stores, which combine physical shoes  
and virtual product information in support of the aspirational asset of  
the brand.  
See the “Asset Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action” section  
at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
** *Function* Content Elements**  
Functions implement the external interfaces to and from a service. The  
simplest example is a code function, which specifies the types and formats  
for virtual-asset parameters that it will accept and return, and will also  
indicate what actions will be taken by the service as a whole, and the  
expected outcomes from that action. Overall, functions may use, reference,  
work with, and/or return any appropriate mix of assets, described in terms  
of the physical, virtual, relational, and aspirational asset types.  
Although a function forms part of the overall “How” for a service, it  
does nothing in itself other than to act as an interface. The actual work  
of a service will be done by the capabilities hidden behind that interface.  
Figure 13-15 summarizes the relationships between function as an external  
interface, capability as an internal “ability- to-do-work,” and the service as  
a whole.  
Figure 13-15. Service as function plus capability  
178 Chapter 13 Service Content  
A well-designed service should be able to switch between different  
capabilities, to cope with different needs such as load balancing and  
emergency business continuity and disaster recovery, without requiring  
significant changes in the service’s function interface. To support this, the  
function should specify the parameters for the respective service-level  
agreement \(SLA\), but allow different parameter values to permit variance  
in the conditions for the SLA to support those different operational needs.  
These distinctions between service, capability, and function can  
sometimes seem confusing at first, in part because function and  
service may seem to be the same thing when seen from the outside,  
and also because function and capability can often become merged  
together in machine design and in some common forms of it-  
systems design. Yet we need to note that merging will *not* apply when  
services and processes are enacted by real people, or when we move  
back to the abstract for process or service redesign. Architecturally,  
it’s important to keep the functions and capabilities separate at a  
conceptual level and be aware of how and why we merge them in  
each service implementation.  
For ZapaMex, its physical functions include the work surfaces and  
controls for the shoe-making machines in the factory; its virtual functions  
include the user interfaces of the applications upstairs in the office. Its  
composite functions include the entryway for the warehouse, which  
receives physical goods and the virtual information associated with those  
goods; the bar-code scanners in the stores that likewise link physical  
shoes and shoe-boxes with their virtual tracking information for stock  
management and sales management; and the physical front door of each  
store, which enables person-to-person relational-asset sales connections  
and aspirational-asset links to brand, guided by virtual assets such as sales  
protocols.  
179 Chapter 13 Service Content  
See the “Function Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action”  
section at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
** *Location* Content Elements**  
Locations are “places” in terms of some context or schema. We describe  
locations via the asset-types set\: physical locations; virtual locations such  
as a URL or an IP address; relational locations, such as displayed in an org  
chart; and aspirational locations, such as relationships between brands.  
There may also be composites of these types, such as the physical plus  
virtual location of a data server.  
We can also describe time as an abstract location\: for example, events  
are located in time, though are not actually part of time itself.  
For ZapaMex, its website has several linked virtual locations, in  
terms of its IP address, domain name, and associated URLs and also the  
merchant ID used for credit-card transactions on the website and in its  
stores. Its factory building has a complex composite location\: it has a  
geographic physical location; its mail address is a virtual location; as a  
place where people work, it is an anchor for person-to-person relational  
locations, and also where work roles and positionings in work hierarchies  
represent relational locations relative to each other; and it is also the  
aspirational location of the brand and of the company’s history.  
See the “Location Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action”  
section at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
180 Chapter 13 Service Content  
** *Capability* Content Elements**  
Capabilities provide the core “How” for a service. However, the content  
for a capability is always a composite and should be described in terms of  
three distinct subsidiary strands\: action, agent, and skill level.  
The action for a capability identifies what the capability will do to  
deliver its value, outcomes, and products. This in turn is determined in  
part by the assets on which it will work, which may be any appropriate mix  
of asset-type content\: physical, virtual, relational, aspirational, and/or  
composite.  
The agent for the capability is someone or something that will do  
the action for the capability and will work on the assets for the action.  
The agent itself is an asset-types element, such as a physical machine, a  
virtual IT application, a real person accessed via a relational-asset link,  
an aspirational asset such as a purpose or brand, or any appropriate  
composite such as a person providing guidance and override for a  
computer-automated machine.  
For this aspect of capability, the “Who” interrogative does sort-of  
make sense when the agent is a real person, but does *not* make  
sense wherever the capability is enacted by a machine or it system.  
Describing the agent of a capability in terms of “Who” versus some  
kind of not-“Who” can lead us into a modeling trap where human  
agents, computer-based agents, and machines are each placed  
in different content-based layers, and it then becomes impossible  
to describe how one type of agent may be substituted for another  
within the same capability. For service models at Row-3 and above,  
it is best to use the more abstract concept of “agent” and only worry  
about the specific type of agent at Row-4 or below.  
181 Chapter 13 Service Content  
The skill level for the capability is the set of competencies or decision  
abilities required from the agent in that action. Skill levels for capabilities  
are closely related to decision levels and are based on the decision-types set  
of rule-based, algorithmic, guidelines, and principle-based.  
For skill levels, it is useful to cross-map the decision types with  
repeatability types such as simple, calculated, ambiguous, and not-known.  
Figure 13-16 summarizes the relationship between those two themes.  
Figure 13-16. Capabilities\: repeatability and skill levels  
This gives us a skill-levels set of simple rule-based decisions such  
as following a predefined step-by-step process or checklist; calculated  
algorithmic or “hard-systems” decisions that follow predictable rules  
but can accommodate branching, delayed feedback, damping, and the  
like; heuristic or “soft-systems” decisions using guidelines, patterns, and  
heuristics to interpret “wicked problems” and complex and emergent  
uncertainties; and principle-based or values-based decisions for contexts  
that are inherently unpredictable and unique.  
These distinctions about skill levels are important for capabilities  
in service design, because physical machines, IT, and people have very  
different capability curves. In general\:  
182 Chapter 13 Service Content  
•  
Physical machines can usually work only on physical  
assets and are best suited to following rule-based  
decisions.  
•  
IT systems can work on virtual assets and, via control  
of physical machinery, physical assets, using rule-  
based or algorithmic decisions, but are still limited  
in capability for pattern recognition, and in general  
should not be used for decision-making in inherently  
unique contexts.  
•  
People can work on any types of assets, with varying  
skill levels, though in many cases are notoriously not  
well-suited to the rigid rule following and mechanical  
repetitive tasks of classic “scientific management.”  
Attempts to use inappropriate types of systems and capabilities in  
a given context will usually lead to ineffectiveness and, in many cases,  
“unexpected” failure.  
For ZapaMex, its capability for shoe-making acts on physical materials  
such as leather, plastics, and thread, using virtual information to keep track  
of those actions. The agents for those actions include physical injection-  
molding machines to make the soles for shoes, information-driven CNC  
machines to cut shoe leather, and people to do hand-stitching of shoe  
parts. In terms of skill levels, the machines must follow simple rules, always  
doing the exact same thing; the CNC cutter can adapt algorithmically for  
different materials and material thickness; and craftspeople make the  
complex decisions and adjustments needed for custom-fitted shoes for  
disabled people.  
See the “Capability Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action”  
section at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
183 Chapter 13 Service Content  
** *Event* Content Elements**  
Events are triggers for action, or the ending of an action. We can describe  
these in terms of the asset-types set\: physical events such as the operation  
of a mechanical safety switch or the arrival of a vehicle; virtual events  
such as an error condition or a counter reaching a predefined level  
within a computer application; relational events such as a phone call or  
a business meeting; and aspirational events such as a change of brand or  
an event causing damage to morale. There can also be composite events\:  
for example, in Japan a ground sensor will send a signal to a mobile phone  
app for people to warn others about an incoming earthquake.  
Note that perhaps most real-world events will be composites of these  
types\: for many purposes, a broader notion of event as a naturally  
composite “package” may be more useful than trying to force all  
events to fit to a single type.  
Note also the previous point about *time*\: events may occur *in* time,  
but are not actually part of time itself.  
For ZapaMex, typical events in its warehouse include the physical  
arrival of a truck, and an electronic or in-person request for materials  
to be moved to the factory floor. For its retail store, its sales process  
begins with the physical event of a potential customer entering the door,  
sending the virtual information event to the sales staff that a customer has  
arrived, leading to the relational and aspirational event of a conversation  
about shoes.  
See the “Event Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action”  
section at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
184 Chapter 13 Service Content  
** *Decision* Content Elements**  
Decisions represent the “why” or “because” for a service and for the  
enterprise as a whole. These are usually built up in layers or hierarchies of  
dependencies, with the question “why?” typically moving upward through  
the layers, and “because” decisions moving down.  
To describe individual decisions, use the decision-types set\: simple  
rule-based decisions such as following a predefined step-by-step process  
or checklist; algorithmic or “hard-systems” decisions based on calculations  
that can accommodate variables such as branching, damping, and delayed  
feedback; more adaptable guideline-based or “soft-systems” decisions,  
using heuristics or patterns to interpret emergent events and contexts;  
and principle-based or values-based decision-making for contexts that are  
not-known, inherently unpredictable, or unique. Most real-world contexts  
require composites of those decision types, such as in a chain of exception  
capture and escalation.  
We may need to be careful about over-reliance on predefined  
“because” decisions, but they do help in keeping decision-making  
simple and fast. The enterprise vision is also the ultimate “*Because.*”  
for that enterprise\: note the period/full stop in that “Because.” which  
indicates that the layering of “Why” stops here!  
In service design, we not only need to identify the decisions that must  
take place within that service, but also ensure that the ability to make  
appropriate decisions does indeed exist at each escalation level in the  
respective context – otherwise the overall process is almost guaranteed to  
fail on some unexpected and unplanned-for event. To do this, we need to  
link each decision within a service to the skill-level type required for each  
agent in the respective capability.  
185 Chapter 13 Service Content  
For ZapaMex, everyone is responsible for safety on the factory  
floor. The decisions in the safety processes there rely mainly on simple  
checklists, cross-checks between machines and the different parts of each  
machine, and heuristics and historical patterns of wear for particular types  
of machine, but also on a more subtle experience-based sense or “feel”  
that something may not be right.  
See the “Decision Content Elements” checklist in the “Into Action”  
section at the end of the chapter for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
#  Cross-checks for Service Content  
The Service-Content model shows us what to identify within each element  
of a service and also helps us to distinguish between the roles in each part  
of the service. Conversely, the Enterprise Canvas cells each specialize in  
different areas of the content-model frame\:  
•  
The core changes to enterprise value take place within  
the Value-Creation cell.  
•  
Tracking of value, and value flow between services,  
takes place within the Value-Outlay, Value-  
Governance, and Value-Return cells.  
•  
The supplier-side and customer-side Channels deal  
with the main transaction events.  
•  
The Relations cells focus on dealing with relational  
and/or aspirational assets.  
We can also use the Service-Content model with the Service-Layers  
model to identify which Canvas layer we’re working in at any given point\:  
•  
If we’re looking at lists of things, we could be anywhere  
up to Row-1.  
186 Chapter 13 Service Content  
•  
If we’re looking at relationships between entities, we  
cannot be above Row-2.  
•  
If we’re looking at attributes of things, we cannot be  
above Row-3.  
•  
If we’re looking at a specific technology or technique, we  
are working on Row-4 or below.  
•  
If we’re looking at records that represent the past, the  
“as-was,” then by definition we are in Row-6.  
With regard to products, we should also note  
•  
A product can be comprised only of asset-type content\:  
if we’re looking at a supposed product that incorporates  
any other content categories, it is either a mis-defined  
product or an incompletely defined service.  
These checks can also help to prevent us from treating any  
prepackaged “solution” as an architectural requirement unless we  
explicitly choose to do so. Note that the only absolute architectural  
requirement for the organization is the enterprise vision, with its associated  
core values\: everything else is an implementation of that requirement, at  
varying levels of abstraction.  
The relationships between primitives and composites are also  
important here. In essence one of our most important architectural cross-  
checks comes down to this\:  
•  
Services are usable to the extent that they are  
architecturally “complete.”  
•  
Services are reusable to the extent that they are  
architecturally incomplete.  
187 Chapter 13 Service Content  
To enable new architectural options, we need to be able to split our  
composites apart; to then enable new service implementations, and  
new business options, we need to be able to re-combine the resultant  
primitives into new combinations.  
For example, as an author, I might think of myself as “a writer of  
books.” But a printed book is actually a composite, a “bundling” of  
information in a specific physical form – and as an author, my actual  
product is the *information*, not the physical book. \(It would be the  
other way round for someone who worked in a printing business, of  
course.\)  
Once I understand that point, it opens up a whole raft of new  
possibilities, new options to deliver the service represented by that  
information. For example, I could dispense with the physical book and  
present the same content in electronic form, as an e-book. I could  
split up the content in different ways, perhaps serialized in smaller  
chunks in an online magazine. I could present it in another virtual  
medium, via video or voice. Or I could deliver it via a relational-asset  
channel, in a form such as in-person consulting. All of these options  
become possible once I split “the book” into its real root primitives –  
or, perhaps more to the point, the options remain entirely invisible  
unless I do that split.  
To make something reusable, we need to move up the layers of  
abstraction, to split apart the implementation composites, and to expose  
any “bundling” that could perhaps be recombined in new ways. To  
make something usable, we need to go down the layers, linking each  
item into more “complete” implementation bundles. At the point where  
188 Chapter 13 Service Content  
it touches the real world, between Row-5 and Row-6, everything must  
be architecturally “complete,” with all Assets, Functions, Locations,  
Capabilities, Events, and Decisions fully defined and addressed.  
The other key point about the Content Model is that it acts as a  
checklist to make sure that we line things up correctly\: for example, that we  
don’t try to use IT for something for which it is not well-suited, or which it  
can’t handle at all.  
Another common trap here is that it can be easy to forget that a  
record of a “something” is *not* the same as the thing itself. The record  
is information, a virtual asset, whereas the item referred to in the  
record could be any type of asset at all – a physical object, a data  
event, a business relationship, whatever. As soon as we find a record  
of something, we need to look for the matching audit processes  
and the like, such as data-cleansing and de-duplication, that would  
ensure that the records *do* line up correctly with the respective  
items – because if that audit process doesn’t exist, we have an  
architecture that almost guarantees service failure.  
We can also use the same checklists to ensure proper coverage not just  
for everyday operations, but also for exceptions such as disaster recovery  
and business continuity. Machines, computer systems, power supplies, or  
network connections may all fail, and whole buildings can be swept away  
in a natural or man-made disaster\: we may well need “manual” processes  
to take over at a moment’s notice. For those cases, we would need the  
respective special-conditions processes to exist, and people with the  
appropriate skills to do them – and also know how to switch over to those  
“manual” processes, too. All of those are items that we can check by using  
the Content-Model checklists in a layered way.  
189 Chapter 13 Service Content  
Another item to check is the content for the flows shared with support  
services and others, and the service functions, capabilities, events,  
decisions, and the like that support those connections. Cross-check these  
with the descriptions of the support services in Chapter 10, “Service  
Guidance,” and the roles of investors and beneficiaries in Chapter 11,  
“Service Investors and Beneficiaries.”  
We also need to ensure that all of the necessary links are in place to  
connect each part of the service all the way back up to the enterprise vision  
and values, as described in Chapter 3, “Service Context and Market,” and  
Chapter 4, “Service Vision and Values.” For example, Figure 13-17 shows  
how the service’s core functionality relates to its role, mission, and goal  
within the vision of the organization and the broader shared enterprise.

Connecting the service to vision, role, mission,  
Finally, we may also need cross-checks on responsibility and  
governance\: for example, a key part of the “Who” for a service will relate  
to questions about responsibilities. This in turn draws on another crucial  
190 Chapter 13 Service Content  
distinction between responsibility and possession\: for example, a process  
owner is the person who is responsible for that process, not the person  
who “possesses” it. In essence, service architectures only work when we  
use a responsibility-based model throughout, such as where “resources”  
become assets only when we take on responsibility for them.  
At any given time, there should always be exactly one person who  
is uniquely responsible for any service element or product element.  
Conversely, every element needs one person who is uniquely responsible  
for it at all times. Look for any overlaps in responsibilities, such as those  
occurring in transitions between layers\: for example, one person may have  
operational responsibility for an item, another has tactical responsibility,  
another the strategic responsibility. Look also for gaps in responsibilities,  
where no one has apparent responsibility, or where the responsibility has  
nominally been assigned but not actually taken up or enacted.  
Note that merely assigning a responsibility to someone does not  
necessarily mean that that responsibility is taken up! Functional  
responsibility is an active *choice*, not an arbitrary label.  
Also note that responsibility can only be held by a real person\: a  
machine or an it box is *not* capable of taking responsibility for  
anything in any legal sense of the term. Hence, especially where it or  
machines are involved, it may at times be necessary to follow lengthy  
trails of non-responsibility, or evasions of responsibility, in order to  
identify the actual responsible person. For a service architect, this can  
often be a challenging task, especially in dysfunctional organizations.  
As a final note, remember that responsibility is literally “response  
ability,” the ability to choose and act on appropriate responses within  
a given context. That means that a person can only be responsible for  
something if they also have the authority and competence to make the  
191 Chapter 13 Service Content  
required decisions. If they do not have that authority or competence, they  
cannot and must not be considered responsible or accountable for the  
item, and hence a further search will need to be made for someone who  
can and does have the required competence and authority.  
See the “Dependencies Between Content Elements” checklist in the  
“Into Action” section here for more on how to apply this to your own  
organization’s services.  
#  Into Action  
You want the change teams in your business-transformation project to use  
a consistent way to describe the internal content and structure of services  
and products, and also ensure that every product and flow that may be  
needed is properly accounted for and properly described. You’ll suggest  
that they should use the Service-Layers and Service-Content models in  
Enterprise Canvas to provide guidance, cross-checks, and completeness  
checklists. Use the ideas in this chapter and the following questions to help  
you guide those conversations.

#  Summary  
In this chapter, we reviewed how to acquire the detail about the internal  
content that is needed for each service and its products. We did this by  
applying checklists to each cell in the service structure and its flows, to  
enquire about the assets, functions, locations, capabilities, events, and  
decisions at play in each case, and how they link together to deliver the  
service itself.  
In the next chapter, we explore how Enterprise Canvas can support us  
in making sense of services as systems and within systems-of-systems.  
203 CHAPTER 14  
# Services As Systems  
Some aspects of systems theory can provide a useful support for modeling  
services with Enterprise Canvas, with an emphasis on recursion, flow,  
strategy, and overall integration. However, we do need to keep this as  
simple as practicable, and also make it clear that this is about the term  
“system” in its more generic sense rather than solely about IT systems. The  
diagrams here should help to explain the concepts and their applications  
for a general business audience where required.  
There’s one important warning here\: we need to know when to stop  
doing a systems analysis! Systems contain other systems, intersect  
with other systems, and form parts of other systems or systems-of-  
systems, and so on ad-infinitum. If we’re not careful, we’d end up  
trying to model the entire world and everything in it\: not a good idea.  
To keep things simple, we apply the “Just Enough Principle”\: we only  
do “just enough analysis” to satisfy the immediate business question.  
Then leave it alone until the next business question comes up, for  
which we’ll do a bit more systems analysis in that specific area of  
concern; and then another business question comes up, for another  
concern; and so on.

205 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
The trick is to leave “hooks” on the outer edges of each piece of  
systems analysis, to which other pieces can connect as appropriate.  
After a while we’ll quietly discover that we’ve actually created  
a systems view across quite a large, broad, fully interconnected  
scope, with maybe a few identifiable gaps that you could fill in later  
whenever the need might arise. But the important point is that we’ve  
let that model evolve in its own way, in its own time, and we haven’t  
tried to do it all in one go.  
These assessments apply especially in Row-3 Service Model, Row-4  
Design Model, and Row-5 Deployment Model, though much of  
it – particularly the section on strategic completion – could also apply all  
the way up to Row-1 Scope.  
#  Enterprises As Systems  
Everything in the enterprise is, implies, or represents a service. In the  
same way, everything is a system, is part of a larger system, contains other  
systems\: systems ad infinitum. In dealing with anything on the scale of an  
enterprise, we need to be able to think in terms of systems and systems-of-  
systems if we’re to have any chance of making sense of what’s going on.  
In a systems sense, much of what we need here can be summarized  
as shown in Figure 14-1, in five straightforward principles\: rotation,  
reciprocation, resonance, recursion, and reflexion.  
206 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
Figure 14-1. Repeatability and systems principles  
Rotation is the simplest of the systems principles. Any real-world  
system is too large and too complex to be seen in its entirety from one view  
alone\: to make sense of it all, we need to be able to rotate through a variety  
of different views and viewpoints and merge those different views together  
to build a more complete picture of the whole.  
This is straightforward enough\: every checklist does it. One of the  
aims of the Enterprise Canvas is that it provides us with a set of visual  
checklists to give us a range of different interlinked views on the service in  
scope. We can then use it as a checklist, as a systematic rotation through  
multiple views.  
Reciprocation and resonance present a matched pair of principles  
that apply mainly to flows. In a simple world, flows will all need to balance  
somehow\: “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction” and  
suchlike. In that sense, flows need to be reciprocal; at the market level,  
there needs to be “fair exchange,” “quid pro quo” – or at least a verifiable  
perception of that. Reciprocation is a key part of what we explore when we  
do an assessment of service-flow content.  
The complication is that although things do have to balance up  
somehow, the flows may not be a simple “tit for tat.” Often there will be  
delays in a feedback loop, or translations from one form of energy to  
another – for example, financial donors to a charity typically receive a  
207 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
return in the form of a different kind of satisfaction. In terms of ­ point-to-point  
physics, each transaction can be seen as a simple win/lose; but when we  
take the resonance of those feedback loops into account, win/lose turns out  
to be a special case in a full spectrum between win/win and lose/lose.  
That last point applies especially in social flows and transactions – and  
frequently leads to “unexpected” wicked problems if we’re not aware of  
what’s actually going on. To help us make sense, we can use the Enterprise  
Canvas to describe resonance and reciprocation in the interactions and  
flows across the whole system, especially over time.  
Recursion and reflexion provide another matched pair of principles  
that become particularly important when dealing with true complexity.  
Recursion will occur when the same pattern repeats, or, in fractal-  
recursion, is “self-similar,” at different levels of the same system. A  
conventional reporting hierarchy is recursive\: the pattern repeats at  
different levels of management. A service-oriented architecture is  
recursive\: the same concept of services – the same pattern of services –  
applies in much the same ways at every level of the enterprise.  
Reflexion is the inverse of this\: if recursion means that every part in  
some ways reflects the whole, then we can also infer the whole – or some  
aspects of the whole – from within every part. Note, though, that it’s like  
the holograph, in that every discrete part of the image also contains all  
of the image, but in less detail – and that loss of detail can sometimes be  
misleading if we extrapolate anything out too literally.  
Within the Enterprise Canvas, one of the most immediate examples  
of recursion is that every cell within the overall service shown on the  
Canvas is also itself a service. The Supplier-Relations cell, for example,  
not only provides “supplier-relations” services on behalf of the service  
that we depict on the Canvas, but to do so it must also have its own Value  
Proposition in presenting those services. It has its own Supplier Channels  
and Customer Channels \(the latter rather than the former being how, in  
this case of Supplier Relations, it actually delivers its services\); it has its  
208 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
own Value Creation in which it creates the value of those supplier relations,  
and so on. And each of those sub-cells too has its own flows, some of them  
linking externally on behalf of the main service, others linking to other  
cells and sub-cells within the service.  
The inverse is also true. Whenever we come across a business entity  
or function that delivers what we might interpret as “supplier-relations  
services,” we need to ask who or what service it delivers these services  
for. We also need to look for and identify its matching Supplier Channels,  
Value Creation, Customer Channels, Value Outlay, and the like that  
provide its “sibling” services in terms of the Enterprise Canvas.  
Typically, whenever we go “down” a level into the recursion, we move  
closer toward real-world implementation, and whenever we go “up” a  
level in the recursion, we’re usually also moving up a layer of abstraction,  
as described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers.” In that sense, abstraction and  
recursion are closely linked within the Canvas – which is also another  
reason why abstraction \(rather than, say, management hierarchy\) is the  
most effective framework for layering here.  
#  Impact of Time Compression  
The spectrum of repeatability, from predictable to unique, can tell us a  
great deal about what skills are needed in any given context. However,  
there is an important rider to this, which relates to the amount of time  
available for decision and action. Introducing this additional dimension  
in effect forces that simple linear spectrum into a more complex two-axis  
frame, as shown in Figure 14-2.  
209 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
Figure 14-2. Repeatability, time, and order  
Note that there are several other axis pairs and interpretive frames  
that can be used with this model of repeatability – see my book  
*Everyday Enterprise Architecture* for a range of other practical  
examples.  
The key point about this variant of the repeatability model is that it  
describes what may happen at different timescales. The split between  
“order” and “unorder” is fairly straightforward\:  
•  
•  
Order\: Repetition of a rule or formula will always  
deliver the same results; there is an identifiable “right  
way” or “best practice” for any context; analysis is the  
most reliable approach; key driver is logic or “truth.”  
Unorder\: Repetition of a rule or formula will either  
not ensure the same results \(Ambiguous\) or will  
never repeat the same results \(Not-known\); there is  
210 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
no identifiable “right way” or “best practice” that will  
always deliver the same results in a given context;  
iterative experimentation is the most reliable approach;  
key driver is value or feelings.  
At different timescales, different options become emphasized. As  
“time for thinking” becomes available, the emphasis can shift toward  
experimentation \(ambiguous\) or analysis \(calculated\). At the extreme, with  
infinite time seemingly available, there tends to be a drift toward “analysis  
paralysis,” or endless experimentation that seems to lead nowhere.  
But in the other direction, as time becomes more compressed into an  
increasingly urgent “do it now!” the available choices become squeezed  
into a narrow spectrum between simple rule following, at one extreme, to  
a kind of impenetrable real-time improvisation, dancing with the chaos in  
a way that would be incomprehensible to anyone else – or, in some cases,  
even to those doing the work. In effect, it presents a savage split between  
the limited competence of the raw trainee – unable to adapt to anything  
outside of the rules – and the hyper-competence of the multi-year master –  
who has no time to explain – and no apparent means or time to learn how  
to move from one capability to the other.  
In practice, the Value-Creation and the main-channel interfaces –  
Supplier Channels and Customer Channels – tend to fall naturally into  
this time compression\: the nature of the work is that there will be no  
time available to stop and think. Other cells will often fall into much the  
same pattern, simply as a result of day-to-day pressures of work. Yet skills  
development can only take place if there is sufficient “time-to-think” to  
reflect on action. Hence, it is essential that every service, and every cell in  
every service, is backed up by learning processes – usually delivered via the  
Validation and/or Coordination guidance services. The aim would be that  
time-to-think is available before action – as planning – and time-to-think  
is available after action, as reflection on performance, so that there is no  
need to think during the real-time action of the service itself.

#  Systems and Cycles  
Another useful frame here is Five Elements. This provides a set of distinct  
perspectives into a service that also link together into a continuous change  
cycle, as an internal counterpart to the external Service Cycle. It is based  
in part on what is perhaps the oldest-known systems framework, the  
ancient Chinese wu-xing, which has been used to guide systems-based  
sensemaking and decision-making across many types of contexts for more  
than two thousand years. Classic wu-xing describes a context in terms of  
five distinct element-like perspectives that cross-check and interact with  
each other\: wood, new developments, new beginnings; fire, the energy  
for change, Adam Smith’s “the animal spirits of the entrepreneur”; earth,  
providing the material for change; metal \(or, in the earliest versions, stone\),  
the action of change; and water, the outcomes of change, feeding back into  
the new.  
In the Five Elements model, these “elements” translate into a set of  
business-oriented terms\: respectively, as Purpose, People, Preparation,  
Process, and Performance. This frame is shown in Figure 14-3.  
212 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
Figure 14-3. Five Elements frame  
We can use the Five Elements perspectives as a set of themes or  
“lenses” through which to explore issues relating to overall effectiveness\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Appropriate\: Supports and optimizes support for  
business purpose  
Elegant\: Clarity, simplicity, consistency, self-adjusting  
for human factors  
Efficient\: Optimizes the use of resources and minimizes  
wastage of resources  
Reliable\: Predictable, consistent, self-correcting,  
supports “single source of truth”  
Integrated\: Creates, supports, and optimizes synergy  
across all systems  
213 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
We need to apply these themes systematically across the entire  
enterprise, to each of its services, to each of that service’s cells and “child”  
services, and to each of its flows. The aim here is to ensure that every  
aspect of a service will fit in with and support everything else throughout  
the overall enterprise\: exploring these themes will help to identify where  
they support overall effectiveness, where they don’t, and if they don’t, what  
to do about it. As shown in Figure 14-4, each theme also acts as a cross-  
check to each of the others.  
Figure 14-4. Five Elements\: effectiveness  
As also seen in Figure 14-4, each of these perspectives also has  
its own view of time\: far future, “people-time,” near future, “now!”  
and past, respectively. It’s important to note these differences in time  
perspectives when assessing effectiveness. They can often lead otherwise  
to “inexplicable” clashes between work groups and across the organization  
and enterprise.  
214 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
We can also connect the Five Elements perspectives together, as  
phases of action or focus in a mutually supportive sequence. This usage  
for Five Elements is derived in part from Bruce Tuckman’s well-known  
Group Dynamics model of distinct phases in the life sequence of a project\:  
forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Here, though,  
we link the end of one sequence to the beginning of the next of a new  
sequence, to form a continuous cycle with each new sequence starting at  
“forming” and Purpose, as shown in Figure 14-5.  
Figure 14-5. Five Elements\: five phases in the continuing lifecycle  
The same pattern will also repeat across an organization, with different  
business units enacting different parts of the cycle\:  
•  
Purpose\: Strategy, futures, business intelligence,  
corporate identity, brand  
•  
People\: HR, training, organizational development,  
narrative knowledge, health and safety, security  
•  
Preparation\: Planning, scheduling, project  
management, procurement, infrastructure, logistics  
215 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
•  
Process\: Production, manufacturing, sales \[in a sales  
context\], any “service-delivery” function  
•  
Performance\: Book-keeping, performance records,  
accounting, audit, archive; also “lessons-  
learned” review  
In effect, each of these business units is a service in its own right, with  
its own mix of service content\: assets, functions, locations, capabilities,  
events, and decisions. The same applies likewise to each of those business  
units’ subsidiary services, and their “child” services, all the way down  
to the smallest level of detail – again each with their own mix of service  
content and each activity following the same Five Elements sequences  
and cycles.  
Yet there are also small elements of service content that act as  
connectors between each of the Five Elements nodes, which we could  
summarize as follows\:  
•  
Values bring Purpose for People.  
•  
Policies provide the overarching guidance for  
Preparation.  
•  
Start-Events signal the transition from Preparation into  
the main action of Process.  
•  
Completions mark the end of Process and the start of  
Performance review.  
•  
Satisfaction for all parties at the end of Performance  
review connects back to Purpose.  
This aspect of the Five Elements model is based in part on ideas from  
the VPEC-T framework developed by Nigel Green and Carl Bate – see  
Chapter 16, “Integration with Architectures.”  
216 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
As summarized in Figure 14-6, the Five Elements nodes identify  
the sets of activities that need to occur in the respective phases of this  
internal service cycle, and the connectors signal the boundaries between  
the phases in the cycle – all of it centered around Trust, exactly as in the  
external Service Cycle for all flows between services.  
Figure 14-6. Five Elements\: service-activity cycles  
These types of Five Elements reviews of service effectiveness and  
service-activity sequences will provide key cross-checks for successful  
service design and service operation. They can also highlight important  
risks and opportunities, and surface options for potential service  
improvements that might otherwise be hidden from view.  
#  Strategy and Lifecycle Completion  
The Five Elements model also provides an important view into the  
relationships between strategy, tactics, and operations\:  
217 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
•  
•  
•  
Strategy is about the relationships between the  
organization and the enterprise, between the  
organization and the people who work within it, and  
between the organization and its various “external”  
stakeholders – relationships which mostly center  
around identity, belonging, and feeling.  
Tactics is about translating those relationships into  
explicit plans for action in the near future – activities  
which mostly center around analysis and thinking.  
Operations or “execution” is focused on action in  
the immediate present – everything here will center  
around doing.  
As shown in Figure 14-7, the overall flow of the activities lifecycle  
passes through each of these modes in turn – which in practice means that  
an explicit balance needs to be maintained between them.  
Figure 14-7. Strategy, tactics, operations\: links to Five Elements  
218 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
However, the modes also often represent fundamental differences in  
mindset and worldview – which can lead to serious problems if any one  
of the modes comes to dominate over the others. We can perhaps see this  
most easily via a cross-map to the market cycle.  
Figure 14-8. Operations, tactics, strategy, and the market cycle  
In this view of the market cycle, as shown in Figure 14-8, there are  
three distinct stages of completion – each of which offers a choice as to  
whether to continue in the cycle, or loop back to an earlier stage.  
219 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
Figure 14-9. Short-term failure\: operations mistaken for strategy  
As shown in Figure 14-9, an operations-centric view that is over-  
focused on the short term will loop back to the next task as soon as the  
current main-channel task is complete, without checking for completion  
of anything coming back along the return channel. This is typical for any  
production-oriented service, though can often work quite well if there is  
linkage to another service that can take over the main cycle at that point.  
The catch is that it must assume that there are no changes at all in the  
context, because it has no means within itself to adapt to change\: if there  
is any change in the context, the service will usually fail. If an obsessive  
focus on “doing” comes to dominate so much that operations itself is taken  
as “strategy” – as in the fixed Five Year Plans of the old communist era, for  
example – then system failure is guaranteed in the relatively short term.  
220 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
Figure 14-10. Medium-term failure\: tactics mistaken for strategy  
A more common source of failure risk, as shown in Figure 14-10,  
occurs at the second Completions choice, which occurs early in the  
Performance phase. In a commercial context, this is the “monetization  
point,” the point at which payment has been received and in which the  
financial part of the transaction is complete\: from the service’s perspective,  
a basic “satisfaction for self” has been achieved. In services that are  
dominated by notions of “results” – as is all too common in business –  
there is then a tendency to want to loop back straight away to a point  
somewhere within the Preparation phase, to set up the next transaction  
and get back to “monetization” as quickly as possible. This also leads to a  
situation where relatively short-term tactics are mistaken for strategy – as  
in the classic pseudo-strategy of “our strategy is last year’s target plus 10%.”  
The problem is that the overall transaction – “satisfaction for all”  
rather than solely “satisfaction for self” – was never completed, there is no  
reaffirmation of mutual Trust, and the all-important reconnections with  
Purpose and People were never made, often dismissed as “unnecessary  
overhead.” The resultant “quick-profit failure cycle” does deliver higher  
profits in the short term, but leads to an initially slow yet accelerating  
221 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms  
deterioration of trust within the market, and a widening disconnect from  
the enterprise and the people within and beyond the organization – setting  
the stage for an increasingly desperate yet apparently “inexplicable” slide  
into irrelevance. This can be an all-but-guaranteed recipe for service  
failure over the medium to longer term.  
The reality, though, is that in some cases the full Five Elements cycle  
can be overly time-consuming, and a too-frequent review of Purpose  
and even of People will not only be an excessive overhead in most  
contexts, but will soon become an extreme annoyance as well\: “change is  
mistaken for progress.” In practice, especially in most production-oriented  
environments, it usually is safe to take those two “short-cuts,” to keep the  
overall flow moving as quickly as possible, for everyone’s satisfaction. The  
keyword, though, is “usually”\: the trick is to know when it’s safe to do  
so, or when we do need to work our way through all of the Completions,  
carefully, and in sequence. There are key questions there that need to be  
asked in any service design with the Enterprise Canvas.  
#  Into Action  
You have some concerns that your change teams might miss potential  
issues that could arise through how services interact with each other across  
the whole context and scope of your business transformation, perhaps  
particularly when timescales become a factor in the story. You want them  
to use systems perspectives as a cross-check – and also understand that the  
term “system” applies to much more than just the IT. Use the ideas in this  
chapter and the questions below to help you guide those conversations.  
#  Enterprises As Systems

How do we move between the different views and tests  
indicated by the checklist? What do we need to do to  
avoid becoming stuck on a single view as “the truth”?  
What checklists and checklist items are missing from  
this view? What other views or checks do we need?  
How do we link all the different views together? Since  
all of them present some form of “truth,” how do we  
resolve any conflicts that may occur between all of  
these different forms of “truth”?  
How do we ensure that there is balance –  
reciprocation – across all flows for this service?  
Given that forms of value may change across the  
service, or between the relations channel, main  
transaction channel, and return channel, how do we  
keep track of these changes? How do we ensure that  
there is “fair exchange” even when the form of value  
has changed?  
At what point do simple notions of balance – “double-  
entry life-keeping” – become more of a hindrance than  
a help in understanding the flows of this service? At  
what point do we need to accept natural resonance –  
increasing or decreasing – within the flow?  
How would we create a resonance in a flow, to increase  
a desirable effect, or dampen \(reduce\) an undesirable  
one? And who decides which resonances are  
“desirable” or “undesirable”?  
How do we ensure that changes in balance – such  
as created by resonance – are shared appropriately  
between all parties in the enterprise? Who decides  
223 ChAPTEr 14 ServICES As SySTEms

how that changing balance is to be shared? How can  
we ensure that those decisions are in line with the  
enterprise vision?  
What patterns of recursion can you identify within the  
structure of the service and its flows? In what ways  
could you use such patterns to reduce complexity  
across the overall system? What advantages and  
potential problems are implied by those patterns?  
In what ways can aspects of the whole be seen reflected  
in any or many of the system’s individual parts? In  
what ways could you use such patterns to reduce

What are the skills and capabilities required in the

If the service requires delivery in very short timescales,  
what checklists and other Simple-domain tools and

into an unmanaged Chaotic state? What “master”-  
level skills are required in order to bring the service  
out of such a Chaotic state? From where are these skills  
available?  
What time is available for analysis and experimentation  
within the service itself? If none, where does planning  
and reflection take place? Who or what guides this  
planning and reflection?  
224 •

If there is no time within the service for planning,

in the long term, medium term, or even short term?

#  Summary  
In this chapter, we learned that it can be useful to take a “systems”  
view of a service and its context. We reviewed a range of systems-type  
techniques and perspectives that can help us to assess integration issues,  
strategic concerns, and other related themes for service modeling with  
Enterprise Canvas.  
In the next chapter, we explore a variety of service patterns in which  
Enterprise Canvas can help us make sense of the respective service and its  
context.  
227 CHAPTER 15  
# Example Patterns  
One of the more valuable uses for Enterprise Canvas is that it provides a  
consistent pattern to guide a basic completeness check for service designs.  
As with the core principles for Enterprise Canvas, we can apply this kind of  
completeness check at any level, from whole-organization to detail-level  
service. This chapter shows five brief examples of this completeness-check  
review as applied to various types of service\:  
•  
For-profit business, at whole-of-organization level  
•  
Not-for-profit charity, at whole-of-organization level  
•  
IT service management, as a business unit within the  
organization  
•  
Simple IT-based business process, described as a  
BPMN model \(Business Process Modeling Notation\)  
•  
Military squad, as a people-based capability  
See “Appendix D\: Enterprise Canvas As Service Viability Checklist,” for  
a more detailed description of the review process.

management” and the legal mandates of current corporate law for publicly  
owned corporations, particularly in the USA.  
In this structure, “the enterprise” and “the organization” share the  
same boundary. The two terms are considered to be exact synonyms  
for each other\: there is no real link with, or even awareness of, a shared  
enterprise beyond the organization, and relations with suppliers and  
customers alike are often characterized by a combative “us against them.”  
By custom and sometimes by law, monetary return is defined as the  
only meaningful form of value\: it is assumed that the only reason that the  
organization exists is to make money for the stockholders, as the purported  
owners of the enterprise. Given this requirement, the enterprise vision is  
straightforward and exclusive\: “make money” from the market, as much of  
it as possible, to optimize or maximize the returns to the stockholders over  
the short to medium term.  
All of the guidance functions – Direction, Coordination, and  
Validation – are subsumed into an expanded notion of “management”  
which takes over the Value-Governance cell, in part to gain a more direct  
connection to the “owners.” This also has the effect of replacing Direction’s  
future focus with an over-emphasis on past performance, in effect flipping  
the Enterprise Canvas structure upside down and usually forcing any  
business model to run on the “quick-profit failure cycle” described in the  
“Strategy and Lifecycles” section in Chapter 14, “Services As Systems.”  
Structurally, Validation and Coordination are replaced by “command” and  
“control,” respectively, and, other than as required by law, often explicitly  
disconnected from anything beyond the organization. That self-isolation  
can also result in an insistence on proprietary standards, a tendency  
toward a “not invented here” syndrome, and increased risks of regulatory  
challenge.  
Figure 15-1 shows an Enterprise Canvas overview of the probable  
structure of the organization-as-a-service that would arise from that  
description above.  
230 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Figure 15-1. Overview Canvas for publicly owned for-profit business  
Within the service functions represented in the main Canvas,  
the natural boundaries between the cells tend to be exaggerated and  
reinforced as distinct silos. There is often a rigid separation between  
development and production, and even more so between line  
management against all other parts of the service\: the classic Taylorist  
separation between “management” and “workers.” Management also  
often claims the entire return channel as its own private domain, asserting  
rigid control over budget and all monetary matters and using the resultant  
scarcity of resources as a substitute for values-based governance.  
With the loss of any real focus on the future, and the absence of any means  
to connect the organization to the vision of a broader shared enterprise, there  
is no available option for a “pull”-based marketing model via a shared Value  
Proposition. Its only alternative is some form of product development derived  
from internal assumptions about “something we can sell.” Without any direct  
engagement in the value proposition, the organization’s potential customers  
are unlikely to feel much inherent engagement in the product; hence, it  
becomes the unhappy role of marketing to attempt, via “push,” to manufacture  
a sort-of-“relationship” with customers where no real reason for any such  
relationship actually exists.  
231 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Overall, although common in the business world, this inherently  
dysfunctional structure is unlikely to be successful or effective in the  
longer term, for anyone involved – not even for the stockholders. Yet a  
comparison of this structure with the generic Enterprise Canvas indicates  
what can be done to improve matters – of which the most important is to  
break the delusion that the organization “is” the enterprise and instead  
connect the organization with the shared vision and shared values of its  
broader market and extended enterprise beyond the organization itself.  
#  Example 2\: Not-for-Profit Charity  
Not-for-profit organizations and charities operate under different laws and  
social expectations than those that apply to for-profit organizations, which  
in turn gives rise to a different typical structure for the organization-as-  
a-service.  
Much the same principles as here *should* apply to the government  
context, since that too is nominally “not-for-profit.” In practice,  
though, the “guidance” functions there often tend to be subsumed  
into the executive, much as in the dysfunctional for-profit model, and  
with much the same dysfunctional results.  
In this example, the charity aims to deliver a service to its recipients,  
yet to do so must engage donors to provide the resources needed in order  
to deliver those services, and hence must also act as a direct and explicit  
intermediary between donors and recipients.  
232 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
The same principles apply to almost any charity, but charities in  
practice often have very complex relations between many different  
types and roles of providers; for this example we’ll keep it simple,  
and imagine a charity that provides clothing to victims of natural  
disasters.  
Here the boundaries of the organization may include the “direction”  
guidance functions – as in a conventional for-profit business – but the  
“coordination” and “validation” functions must extend beyond the  
organization itself. On the “coordination” side, this charity must coordinate  
its service delivery with other charities and services that operate in the  
same disaster zone – medical, shelter, food, rescue, security, and suchlike;  
and on the “validation” side, the charity’s services and activities will only  
make sense to donors and recipients alike if they connect to a shared  
vision such as “keeping people safe, warm, and comforted after an  
emergency.”  
Many charities start off with something like a “product-  
development” model, designing support services of some kind  
as a metaphoric equivalent of “something we can sell,” and then  
delivering those services. As a “push”-type activity, though, it may  
be difficult for it to make sense even to the nominal recipients, and  
unless the connection is made to a “higher cause” that will engage  
others, the charity will soon run out of resources, and fail. All the  
problems and potential mistakes faced by commercial “startups”  
apply just as much to charities and other not-for-profits\: the only  
difference is that resources and “profit” may be measured in a  
different way.  
233 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
The Value Proposition here is straightforward\: given the shared vision,  
there is a clear need for clothing to replace items lost in natural disasters –  
a need which will be all too evident to the intended recipients, and will  
also make immediate sense to potential donors. This in turn implies the  
need for a service to deliver such clothing in a disaster-recovery context  
\(the Value-Creation cell, here described as “service operation”\); and for  
some form of management, in donor locations, on the spot in the disaster-  
affected region, and in logistics in between \(the Value-Governance cell,  
here labeled “service management”\). The linkage to value and enterprise  
values is therefore reasonably clear, though we will have to drill down from  
this very simple Row-2 model all the way to a Row-5 detailed-  
implementation model to get a proper picture of what all of this would  
entail in practice.  
On the donor side, we need to explain what the need is, and why it  
should be seen as important \(Supplier Relations, here labeled “cause  
marketing”\), and encourage two-way conversations that will engage  
people directly in the enterprise values and thence in the charity’s value  
proposition. Assuming that this engagement does happen, we’ll also  
have created the space for transactions to occur, much like a supplier  
relationship in a commercial context – in this case, the donors supplying  
either clothing or money to assist in delivery of that clothing, or both  
\(Supplier Channels, here labeled “fundraising/collection”\).  
On the recipient side, we need to identify appropriate “customers” for  
our clothing service. Given that this will take place in a disaster-recovery  
context, gaining their trust will also be crucial here – hence, again, the  
importance of two-way communication to create engagement in the  
shared vision \(Customer Relations, here shown as “recipient relations”\).  
We then need to match their needs with the available resources, both on-  
the-­ spot and via requests further back along the charity’s logistics chain  
\(Customer Channels, here labeled “service delivery”\).  
234 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
In both cases, the return channel \(Value Return and Value Outlay, here  
labeled “recipient results” and “cause results,” respectively\) is significantly  
different from that in a commercial context. For a business, “success” is  
a profitable sale; income and costs alike can, it seems, all be reduced to  
monetary metrics, which makes the measurement of “success” a mere  
matter of quick calculation – all very simple and straightforward. But as  
soon as we realize that there are other forms of value in play than money  
alone – as is immediately evident here, if perhaps less so in a commercial  
context, then we need to look for a much broader definition of “success,” in  
fact drawn directly from the shared values of the extended enterprise.  
In this case the charity would probably not expect any payment from  
the recipients for the clothing. What will matter much more instead will  
be some form of proof that the service delivery was in accordance with the  
shared values of the enterprise – hence, for example, all those photos of  
happy, smiling, well-clothed children that we would expect to see passing  
through the return channel, to appear as “cause results” on the charity’s  
website and in reports to donors. The return channel closes the loop of  
value; and its balance overall, across all relevant forms of value, provides  
the proof that the organization has indeed delivered added value in terms  
of the extended enterprise’s vision and values.  
Figure 15-2 shows an Enterprise Canvas overview of the probable  
structure of the organization-as-a-service that would arise from that  
summary mentioned previously.  
235 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Figure 15-2. Overview Canvas for a charity  
Note that it’s not true that money doesn’t matter here\: it does. In fact, it  
matters a lot, not least because potential donors are very quick to withdraw  
support from any charity that is perceived to carry too much overhead in  
any form, monetary or otherwise. The key point here is that money is not  
the only form of value in play in the overall transactions of the charity – a  
point which, in an architectural sense at least, also applies in every “for-  
profit” organization as well.  
#  Example 3\: ITIL IT Service Management  
For this next example, we will explore something more in the mid-range\:  
IT service management within a large organization. The typical reference  
for this is Version 3 of ITIL, the IT Infrastructure Library.  
236 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
For our purposes here, ITIL Version 3 is a better fit than the later  
Version 4, because it is more generic and implementation-  
neutral in its description of service management, whereas Version 4  
reverts to being focused almost exclusively on IT services – as one  
would expect for an IT standard, of course.  
This standard describes service management overall in terms of five  
distinct strands\: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition,  
Service Operation, and Continual Process Improvement. We can map  
those core ideas onto the Enterprise Canvas, and see what we get in terms  
of an overall pattern for service management. The result, as shown in  
Figure 15-3, shows that it does all fit quite well.  
Figure 15-3. Overview Enterprise Canvas for IT service management  
237 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
One immediate point is that the definitions of “customer” and  
“supplier” are fairly fluid here\: many actual stakeholders will take both  
types of roles at various times, so it definitely does help if – as the Canvas  
allows us to do – we take a symmetric view of the respective relations,  
main-channel and return-channel interfaces.  
Another key point is that it does depend strongly on a clear value  
proposition, here summarized as “the right IT services, when we need  
them.” All of the ITIL processes revolve around that core idea and  
the values that lie behind it. The ITIL specification helps in this, too\:  
for example, in describing Service Strategy, the Overview document  
states that “customers do not buy products, they buy the satisfaction of  
particular needs.”  
All of this requires very strong linkages beyond the service itself – almost  
the exact antithesis of the Taylorist-style model for the preceding “for-profit  
business” example. In the Enterprise Canvas, these linkages are provided  
by \(or rather, modeled as\) the guidance services\: the structured layers of  
validation, direction, and coordination, as described in Chapter 10, “Service  
Guidance.”  
To model ITIL in its entirety, we would probably create a separate  
Enterprise Canvas at Row–2 “Business Model” for each of the five major  
service streams, shown in parallel on a single diagram, and linked upward  
to the organization \(Row-1 Scope\) and the extended enterprise \(Row-0\).  
We would then expand downward, into a more detailed set of Row-3  
Service-Model models, some of which would be shared across two or more  
of the ITIL service groups; and then downward again to Row-4 Design  
Model and beyond. It’s clear, though, that ITIL Version 3 and Enterprise  
Canvas do work well together here.  
238 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
#  Example 4\: BPMN Process Model  
This pattern may help to demonstrate why there should be serious  
concerns about the limitations and incompleteness of so many of our  
current service-design methods and so much of current enterprise  
architecture. To illustrate this, let’s return to the simplified BPMN diagram  
from Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” as shown in Figure 15-4.  
Figure 15-4. Simple BPMN model of account-creation process  
The process model purports to describe the service of creating an  
account – in other words, something that we would expect to model  
on the Enterprise Canvas. But in terms of service design and service  
completeness, Figure 15-5 shows what we would actually get from that  
form of service model when we map it onto the Canvas.  
239 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Figure 15-5. Derived Enterprise Canvas for account-creation service  
What we have from the BPMN model is only a tiny subset of what we  
actually need in order to make sense of it as a service\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
There’s no concept of any precursors to transactions –  
the content and interfaces for the usual Supplier/  
Customer-Relations cells.  
There’s no concept of any return channel – the content  
and interfaces for the Value-Outlay/Return cells.  
There’s only the most minimal of content for Value  
Governance, namely, the small part that deals with the  
decision-making and business logic with the execution  
of the process.  
There’s no “why” anywhere in the process model – no  
Value Proposition, no known reason why this particular  
process and service should even exist.  
240 •  
Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
There’s no linkage anywhere to “the big picture,” the  
guidance services that link this process to the various  
qualitative concerns, or even to the inter-service  
choreography needed to coordinate the execution of  
the complete end-to-end business process.  
to be fair, the equivalents of “Supplier” and “Customer”  
and their interfaces could be represented by headers in parallel  
swimlanes – but that still wouldn’t tell us anything about the  
coordination of the full *end-to-end* business process.  
The Canvas itself doesn’t show the assets such as the account record,  
for example, or the triggering events, or the location, which is also absent  
from the BPMN model; yet all of those are items that we would expect  
to pick up straight away by applying a service-content assessment \(see  
Chapter 13, “Service Content”\) to the respective cells – particularly the  
Value-Creation cell, here shown as “process execution.” In the same way, a  
service-flows assessment of the interfaces \(see Chapter 9, “Service Flows”\)  
would tell us much more about the respective flows than we have here in  
the BPMN model.  
What this pattern does show us, though, is how to use a BPMN diagram  
to populate this part of the base content for an Enterprise Canvas. We  
would then go on from there to fill in all of the blanks, to build a complete  
model of the service that we need for the required purpose.  
241 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
#  Example 5\: Military Squad  
For our final example, imagine the classic military squad, working their  
way out on active patrol in the hinterland somewhere. If they’re troops  
from Britain, it might have been in Afghanistan in the recent past, or the  
exact same place a century and more ago; or if we go back in time a couple  
more millennia, it might have been a Roman squad somewhere out the  
back end of Britannia. It doesn’t really matter which military it might be,  
because at the squad level, most armies have worked much the same way  
since forever, as a closely coupled network of mutual services that we  
might summarize visually as in Figure 15-6.  
Figure 15-6. Overview Canvas for a military squad  
These are roles rather than individual people, and we’ll often see the  
soldiers moving about between these roles from time to time\: when it turns  
into a fire-fight, everyone is instantly a “point-man,” for example. But over  
time, natural tendencies will start to emerge, individual soldiers falling  
more often into one role than another, either because of specific training,  
or just as a matter of habit.  
242 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
We can summarize these roles from Figure 15-6 in the respective  
Enterprise Canvas groups, with the Canvas tasks shown in \[..\] for each role.  
The guidance services are kind of outside that dotted-line boundary  
of the squad itself, yet connect it to the broader world. Although in the  
full Enterprise Canvas there are a fair number of these “external” service  
relationships, they’re represented here overall by one archetypal role\:  
•  
The Officer \[Direction, Coordination, Validation\]  
connects the squad to the big picture, the overall vision  
and values, the “proper channels,” and suchlike.  
The inbound roles, on the left hand or “supplier” side, work on  
interactions coming “inward” to the squad, typically bringing stuff in that  
the squad needs or that come from the overall environment\:  
•  
The Fixer \[Supplier-Relations\] searches around to  
find appropriate sources for what the squad needs or  
smooths the way for things to be found.  
•  
The Quartermaster \[Supplier Channels\] receives  
inbound resources and maintains and distributes them  
around the squad as needed.  
•  
The Clean-up \[Value-Outlay\] settles up, pays the bills,  
and generally quietens things down again after the  
resources have been acquired or received.  
The value-construction roles, “within” the core of the squad, identify  
what value is, create that added value, and keep everything within the  
squad itself moving toward delivery of that added value\:  
•  
The Navigator \[Value Proposition\] identifies the  
pathway \(literal or metaphoric\) that would best achieve  
the purpose as outlined by the “commander’s intent” of  
the Officer.  
243 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
•  
The Maker \[Value-Creation\] takes internal action to  
follow the pathway identified by the Navigator, using  
the resources obtained by the Quartermaster, locally  
guided by the Sergeant.  
•  
The Sergeant \[Value-Governance\] provides local  
guidance and internal coordination, in context of the  
pathway identified by the Navigator, and in accordance  
with the overall intent identified by the Officer.  
\(The Sergeant is more connected to decisions for the here-and-now,  
whereas the Navigator is more connected to the big picture, as map reader  
and the squad’s external radio operator.\)  
The outbound roles, on the right hand or “customer” side, work on  
interactions going “outward” from the squad, typically putting into action  
whatever it is that the squad needs to do to deliver its added value to the  
overall story\:  
•  
The Diplomat \[Customer Relations\] “spies out the  
land” and sets up outward connections with the world  
in the direction \(literal or metaphoric\) identified by the  
Navigator.  
•  
The Grunt \[Customer Channels\] takes outward-facing  
action along the connections set up by the Diplomat.  
•  
The Shake-down \[Value Return\] receives and verifies  
return from the outside world and distributes it through  
the squad as guided by the Sergeant.  
Note here that “customer” may not be a good metaphor here –  
especially not if we try to describe a nominal adversary as a “customer”  
of military services! The actual relations with an adversary are closer to a  
244 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
clash between mutual anti-clients – “someone in the same nominal shared  
enterprise who fundamentally disagrees with how the Other is acting  
within that enterprise.”  
For a great example of this team structure, see the 1963 film *The*  
*Great Escape*, about the real mass escape from the Stalag Luft III  
prisoner-of-war camp in Germany in March 1944. True, some parts  
of that film are very much fictionalized – particularly the role played  
by US actor Steve McQueen, none of which actually occurred in the  
real world. But all of the others – “Big-X” Bartlett, “Forger” Blythe,  
“Surveyor” Cavendish, and the others – were based on real people,  
with real roles in the escape attempt that map exactly to those in the  
Enterprise Canvas shown in Figure 15-6.  
There’s also another variation of this for a smaller group, such as in a  
skirmishing team or reconnaissance unit. For that case, we might reframe  
the squad’s roles into two trios rather than three, as shown in Figure 15-7.  
One trio takes on the “inward-facing” roles \(shown on the left of the  
diagram\), and the other trio taking on both sets of “outward-facing” roles  
\(shown on the right\), but still with the same split of roles for what needs to  
happen before, during, and after the main action.  
245 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Figure 15-7. Overview Canvas for a military skirmish squad  
In effect, it’s still the same overall set of roles, but the outward-facing  
roles deal with all interactions with the “outside world,” rather than  
splitting between “inbound” and “outbound.” We’ll particularly see that  
type of setup when the context is more of a bidirectional partnership with  
others, rather than a “through-flow” of stuff coming in on one side and  
going out the other.  
#  Into Action  
You want your change teams in the business-transformation project  
to ensure, before they move toward implementation, that their service  
designs are structurally complete and do actually make sense in terms  
of what they are intended to do. You’ll suggest that they should use the  
246 Chapter 15 Example Patterns  
Enterprise Canvas pattern as a sanity check and completeness checklist  
for their service designs. Use the ideas in this chapter and the following  
questions to help you guide those conversations\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
In your work context, what patterns do you use to guide  
service design?  
Who is responsible for acquiring and applying those  
patterns?  
If different patterns are used at different levels and/  
or in different business departments or service  
implementations, how do you ensure continuity and  
consistency across those various usages of patterns?  
In what way does each pattern support service  
completeness, in the sense that Enterprise Canvas  
defines and describes completeness?  
Who is responsible for ensuring service completeness,  
both for each service, and across the enterprise as  
a whole?  
#  Summary  
In this chapter we reviewed five example patterns that summarize a range  
of ways to use the Enterprise Canvas in typical enterprise-architecture  
assignments.  
In the next chapter, we will explore how to use Enterprise Canvas in  
conjunction with other enterprise architecture and service-design tools  
and methods.

#  Architectural Frameworks and Model Types  
VPEC-T is probably one of the most useful frames with which to assess the  
various themes and drivers in an information system.  
As indicated in Figure 16-1, the VPEC-T acronym stands for Values,  
Policies, Events, Content, Trust, that represent five different views  
or “lenses” through which to view and make sense of the respective  
business context. The framework is described in detail in the book Lost In  
Translation, by Nigel Green and Carl Bate.

Figure 16-1. VPEC-T as five views into a context  
Some of the underlying ideas from VPEC-T were adapted and re-  
imagined into the VPECS connector nodes between phases in the  
Five Elements change cycle, as described in Chapter 14, “Services  
As Systems.” Note that, as a set of steps in a sequence rather a set  
of dimensions, VPECS adaptation is fundamentally different from the  
original VPEC-T framework, and should *not* be described as “VPEC-T.”  
Archimate is a standard notation for enterprise architectures,  
originally developed in the Netherlands, and later adopted as an  
international standard by The Open Group. Although its coverage  
of enterprise content has expanded over successive versions, it still  
essentially focused on IT. It defines an architecture in terms of three  
content-based layers \(Business, Applications, and Technology\) and three  
interlinked structural emphases \(Static Structure such as data and other  
assets, Behavior such as services and functions, and Active Structure such  
as roles and interfaces\).  
250 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
From an Enterprise Canvas perspective\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Archimate layers to Enterprise Canvas layers\:  
“Business” primarily sits in the Row-2 to Row-3 Canvas  
layers; “Application” and “Technology” sit in parallel  
domains in the Canvas Row-3, Row-4, and sometimes  
Row-5 layers.  
Static Structure\: “Data Object” and other types of  
artifact would translate either to asset-type content  
within Canvas cells or to asset-type products within  
Canvas flows between services.  
Behavior\: The various types of “Service” in each  
Archimate layer would typically each be modeled on  
its own Canvas; the various types of “Process” would  
typically sit in the Value-Creation cell of the respective  
Canvas; the various types of “Function” would typically  
sit as interfaces for the outward-facing cells of the  
respective Canvas.  
Active Structure\: Roles would typically translate as  
Supplier, Customer, or other external parties for a  
Canvas; interfaces as Canvas flows; and components  
\(“Device,” “Application Component,” “Network,” and  
suchlike\) as asset-type content for the respective  
Canvas cell.  
TOGAF \(The Open Group Architecture Framework\) is another well-  
known framework in IT-oriented enterprise architectures that includes a  
well-defined process – the Architecture Development Method, or ADM. Its  
underlying metamodel aligns somewhat with that used in Archimate and is  
based on the same general principles. The ADM can be used with Enterprise  
Canvas for IT-oriented service design, but it can be problematic for use in  
service-design contexts that are not centered primarily or solely around IT.  
251 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
Note that there are ways to adapt the ADM for use beyond IT and/  
or for a whole-of-enterprise scope, as documented in my books  
*Bridging the Silos* and *Doing Enterprise Architecture*; however, as  
with the VPECS adaptation of VPEC-T, these adaptations must *not* be  
described as “TogAF.”  
The Zachman Framework is probably the best known of all  
enterprise-architecture frameworks. It is a simple two-axis matrix with  
either five or six rows representing stages of change from initial intent to  
real-world action, and six columns representing the interrogatives What,  
How, Where, Who, When, and Why, with each cell in the resultant matrix  
representing a specific architectural “primitive.” The standard version is  
somewhat IT-centric\: for example, the only asset type listed in the “What”  
column is Data. The Service-Layers model and Service-Content model  
for Enterprise Canvas are based in part, though with some significant  
adaptations and extensions, on the rows and columns, respectively, of  
the Zachman framework, as described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,” and  
Chapter 13, “Service Content.”  
Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model or VSM is one of the best-known  
and most proven of systems-theory design tools, and was one of the core  
inspirations for Enterprise Canvas. Although the original VSM focused  
mainly on information flows, the same concepts can be applied to flows of  
any asset types, both simple and composite. As shown in Chapter 8,  
“Service Structure,” and Chapter 10, “Service Governance,” the VSM  
“systems” are represented in the Enterprise Canvas model as follows\:  
•  
VSM system–1 \(operations or service delivery\) is shown  
as a rounded-corner box and is represented by the  
nine-cell core of the Canvas.  
252 •  
•  
•  
ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
VSM system–2 \(coordination\) is shown as an  
upward-pointing triangle and is represented by the  
“coordination” guidance services for the Canvas.  
VSM system–3\* \(audit\) is shown as a downward-  
pointing triangle and is represented by the “validation”  
guidance services for the Canvas.  
VSM system–3 \(planning and control\), system–4 \(near  
future\), and system–5 \(far future\) are shown as square  
boxes and are represented by the “direction” guidance  
services for the Canvas.  
Beer’s concept of an algedonic high-priority feedback path that  
can bypass the normal channels is extremely important, and should be  
considered when assessing any or all of the Canvas flows.  
For more information on the standard VSM model and its usage in  
business, see Patrick Hoverstadt’s *The Fractal Organization*; for more  
on its adaptation for service-oriented whole-enterprise architectures,  
see my book *The Service-Oriented Enterprise*.  
Context-space mapping is the underlying framework and process  
on which the Enterprise Canvas is based, and is described in more detail  
in my book Everyday Enterprise Architecture. The core of context-space  
mapping comes down to just four keywords\:  
•  
Sensemaking\: Making sense of the context.  
•  
Strategy\: Deciding what to do with what we’ve  
discovered.  
253 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
•  
Structures\: We look for patterns, for structures,  
for something that’s stable enough for us to build  
something on it or with it or around it.  
•  
Solutions\: We identify and/or define the detail of what  
we’re going to do within the chosen context.  
The underlying process for context-space mapping draws strongly on  
John Boyd’s OODA \(observe, orient, decide, act\) model for agile problem-  
solving, crosslinked to a concept of sensemaking domains as discussed in  
my book Inventing Reality. In context-space mapping, we choose a base-  
frame as a core model and then cross-map to other compatible model  
types while we “go for a walk” – metaphorically speaking – through all of  
the different perspectives offered by the base model and the cross-maps.  
As described throughout this book, the Enterprise Canvas was designed for  
use as a base-map in context-space mapping for service design.  
#  Strategic Frameworks and Model Types  
The Business Model Canvas was another key inspiration for this work,  
and Enterprise Canvas was intentionally designed to be compatible with  
it. The book Business Model Generation by Alex Osterwalder and others  
is an essential companion for any Row-2 or Row-3 service-design work  
for business architectures with Enterprise Canvas. In addition, as shown  
in “Appendix B, Working with Business Model Canvas,” business models  
developed with Business Model Canvas can be mapped directly onto  
Enterprise Canvas for expansion “downward” toward implementation and  
“upward” for verification of alignment with the vision and values of the  
shared enterprise.  
The OMG/BRG Business Motivation Model provides a standard  
framework to assess business drivers and business goals, and, for  
Enterprise Canvas, would particularly apply to the connections between  
254 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
the core Canvas and its “direction” guidance services. Do note, though,  
that its definition and role for “vision” is significantly different from that  
in the ISO9000-based approach used for Enterprise Canvas, and the  
two definitions are essentially incompatible with each other. \(Business  
Motivation Model defines “vision” as a description of a desired future state,  
subordinate to “mission”; Enterprise Canvas, as described in Chapter 4,  
“Service Vision and Values,” defines “vision” as the ultimate anchor for the  
quality system, to which “mission” and everything else are subordinate.\)  
Both definitions are valid in their own context, but we do need to take  
some care to avoid mixing them up when working on service design with  
Enterprise Canvas.  
Other common strategy frameworks that would work well with the  
Enterprise Canvas include Porter’s Five Forces model, Blue Ocean  
Strategy, and the ubiquitous SWOT. In each case we would typically use  
the respective framework to assess the service or organizational unit in the  
Canvas, comparing it against others \(such as for competitiveness analysis\)  
or assessing the flows between the service and other players in the shared  
enterprise \(supply-chain partners, competitors, etc.\). SWOT would be  
used to assess strengths, challenges, opportunities, and the like in the  
usual way, on the service as a whole, on individual cells, on flows, and on  
stakeholder relationships, as summarized in Chapter 13, “Service Content.”  
#  Structural and Operational Frameworks  
# and Model Types  
Industry-specific structural frameworks such as SCOR \(supply chain\),  
eTOM \(telecoms\), and ITIL \(IT service management\) fit well with  
Enterprise Canvas. Each of these frameworks describes its context in terms  
of services, which in turn provides a template and checklist for modeling  
on a Canvas. The main value of linking these frameworks to modeling  
with Enterprise Canvas is that the latter adds distinctions between types  
255 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
of flows that occur before, during, and after the main service transactions  
and also documents the necessary “guidance-service” linkages to overall  
direction, cross-functional coordination, and whole-of-enterprise values.  
SCOR is a layered, hierarchical model whose structures map to  
Enterprise Canvas as follows\:  
•  
Levels 1, 2, and 3 for SCOR roughly correspond  
to Enterprise Canvas Row-2, Row-3, and Row-4,  
respectively.  
•  
The SCOR level-1 structure of Source/Make/Deliver  
corresponds almost exactly to the Enterprise Canvas  
transaction linkage to the supply chain\: SCOR “Source”  
corresponds to the Supplier-Channels flow and cell;  
SCOR “Make” corresponds to the Value-Creation cell;  
and SCOR “Deliver” corresponds to the Customer-  
Channels cell and flow.  
eTOM is another layered model\: eTOM’s levels 0 to 3 roughly  
correspond to Enterprise Canvas Row-1 to Row-4, respectively. As a matrix  
structure, the eTOM services are defined within intersecting cells of the  
matrix, as well as within the row/column overlays themselves; but in each  
case the respective service and its relationships can be mapped onto its  
own Canvas. At the highest level, the eTOM “Strategy Infrastructure and  
Product” grouping has strong links to the “direction” and “coordination”  
guidance services as modeled in Enterprise Canvas; the eTOM “Enterprise  
Management” grouping is in part shared across the “direction” and  
“validation” guidance services; the eTOM “Operations” grouping  
summarizes what happens within the nine-cell core of the Canvas. Also  
note the strong emphasis in eTOM on “Customer”\: this would typically be  
linked to the Customer-Relations cell and flows on the Canvas.  
We reviewed a mapping between ITIL and Enterprise Canvas in  
Chapter 15, “Example Patterns.” At the topmost Row-1 level, there might  
256 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
be a single Canvas for ITIL “service management”; but at Row-2, where  
relationships come into the picture, we would need to model each of ITIL’s  
five main service groups as a separate entity – in other words, a separate  
Canvas for each. We would then devolve downward as required, detailing  
each of the services first in generic form for Row-3, and then in more

Balanced Scorecard is another useful frame to apply across the  
Canvas, particularly in context for the Value-Governance cell, which is  
where performance data and post-transaction records should naturally  
accumulate. It may be useful to augment or review Balanced Scorecard’s  
four standard perspectives – Financial, Internal Business Processes,  
Learning and Growth, and Customer – with other themes derived as  
appropriate from enterprise vision and values. The single most important  
point, especially in a commercial for-profit business, is to loosen the  
stranglehold of finance-centric metrics, and to instead cover the full range  
of meanings of “value” that apply in the shared enterprise.  
Standard review processes and process-improvement models, such  
as Deming/Shewhart PDCA \(Plan/Do/Check/Act\), Root-cause analysis,  
Value-stream mapping, and, where appropriate, Six Sigma, can all be  
usefully applied to the models developed on a Canvas, and in some cases  
257 ChAPTEr 16 INTEgrATIon wITh ArchITECTurES  
modeled in relation to the activities shown on the Canvas. Conceptually  
and operationally, they belong as part of what the Canvas would model  
as its guidance services – in practice usually a collaboration between the  
“validation” and “coordination” services. Note that in general Six Sigma  
should not be used unless the service on the Canvas handles literally  
millions of nominally identical events.  
#  Into Action  
As your change teams move down into the detail of their service designs  
for your business-transformation project, they will need to use a wide  
variety of more specialist models, standards, and tools to guide and  
cross-check their work. You want to recommend that they should use  
Enterprise Canvas as a shared anchor to link together all of those disparate  
approaches and methods. Use the information in this chapter to help you  
guide those conversations.  
#  Summary  
In this chapter, we reviewed how Enterprise Canvas can provide a unifying  
frame through which many different frameworks and model types can be  
linked together and support each other to create an overall integration  
across the architecture.  
In the next, final chapter, we will explore how to invert the “top-down”  
approach that we have used so far, and instead derive the enterprise vision  
by working “bottom-up” from real-world innovations.  
258 CHAPTER 17  
# Rethinking Vision  
# Bottom-Up  
For Enterprise Canvas, everything links back to the vision for the shared  
enterprise that defines a service’s context. As described in Chapter 4,  
“Service Vision and Values,” the enterprise vision is the ultimate anchor for  
the quality system, the meaning of value in and throughout the enterprise,  
and the rules and standards that apply in that context. It also provides  
the core reason for the relationships between each of the players and  
stakeholders in that shared space. From there, the vision then defines  
the context for the market within which the organization can position  
itself, and the supply chains through which the organization connects  
with its suppliers, customers, and other partners. Given those rules, roles,  
responsibilities, and relationships, the organization can identify and  
design all of the services that it needs in order to fulfill its chosen role  
within that supply chain, market, and shared enterprise.  
We can summarize all of that, from the organization’s perspective, as  
shown in Figure 17-1.

Figure 17-1. services  
Enterprise, market, supply chain, organization, and  
Throughout this book so far, we have kept things simple by describing  
these relationships in the way that we would for a startup business\:  
start from the organization and what it wants to do, with the capabilities  
that it has or knows that it can build; identify a shared-enterprise vision  
that it would see as a desirable context; and then work top-down from  
there, identifying the respective market and preferred positioning within  
that market and shared enterprise, that would then place it in the right  
relationships with other players in its preferred supply chain or value web.  
For an existing organization, though, this can often be a lot more  
complicated – particularly when the organization or industry is  
undergoing change, either to respond to a new opportunity or when the  
market itself is facing turmoil from the outside. In those cases, we will often  
need a more freeform approach, one that allows us to rebuild the vision  
and strategy either bottom-up or sideways-out, rather than the startup’s  
simpler top-down style.  
260 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
Undergoing major change of that kind can be challenging enough for  
an organization that, in essence, runs a single business model within a  
single market and which has a single, identifiable shared enterprise – the  
“unitary enterprise,” as shown in Figure 17-2.  
Figure 17-2. enterprise  
Unitary enterprise\: organization within a single shared  
Even in that type of enterprise structure, any significant change to the  
business model may well require the organization to position itself in a  
different market, which has a different shared enterprise as its context,  
with its own distinct and different vision, values, and so on. If that  
happens, then all of those respective context-related changes will need to  
ripple all the way down through the organization, requiring detail-level  
changes to operations, direction, coordination, validation, and more,  
potentially in every single one of its internal services.  
The Enterprise Canvas approach of “everything is, represents, or  
implies a service,” in which the same consistent methods apply the  
same way everywhere, provides perhaps one of the few ways to stay  
even somewhat sane when facing the complexities of that level of  
whole-of-system change.  
261 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
This becomes even more complicated, though, if the change will  
require the organization to operate multiple business models that each  
connect with a different market, each of which in turn will sit within a  
different shared enterprise, with different vision, values, standards, rules,  
and more.  
The only way to make this work is to identify some kind of unifying  
theme that can help to hold everything together, typically in the form  
of a consortium or other similar structures. One common structure  
for this purpose is the “shared-services consortium,” which places  
one organization in the background whose sole “market” is the more  
visible front-facing organizations of the consortium. This “background  
organization” transacts with and provides services or products to the front-  
facing organizations, each of which have their own distinct market and  
enterprise. All of the organizations within the consortium then sit under  
the umbrella of an overarching “enterprise-of-enterprises” that provides  
the unifying theme, as shown in Figure 17-3.  
Figure 17-3. services  
Enterprise-within-enterprise\: consortium with shared  
Another structure, perhaps less common, is the classic “industrial  
conglomerate” type of consortium. This consists of a collection of  
subsidiary organizations, again each with their own market and enterprise,  
262 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
yet have nothing to link them together other than that they all sit under  
some kind of unifying theme, as shown in Figure 17-4.  
Figure 17-4. Enterprise-within-enterprise\: conglomerate  
This can work if the unifying theme is a broader overarching enterprise  
such as an entire industry, or a broad domain such as healthcare,  
government, social service, or defense. However, if the conglomerate is  
simply an outcome of arbitrary merger-and-acquisition activities or similar  
poorly defined organizational aggregations, without any unifying shared  
enterprise to provide the reason and purpose to stay together, there is a  
high risk of failure from infighting between the organizations, or as a result  
of no common direction.  
To summarize, responding to change at a whole-of-organization level  
can bring real benefits, yet also real risks, which can only be managed by  
careful attention to the framing of the shared enterprise.  
In the remainder of this chapter, we will explore five real-world  
examples where an organization either reinvented their business or  
created a new one, and reframed the overarching definition and structure  
of the enterprise to make the change work. In each case we will assess  
the context and the trigger for change; the relationship between the  
new market and the old; the role of technology in the change; and the  
impact on the overall enterprise vision, echoing back down through the  
organization itself.  
263 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
#  Example 1\: Swatch  
Swatch created a new market and enterprise for a country’s watchmaking  
industry, built around a new “unitary-enterprise” type of structure.  
For Swatch, the trigger for urgent change was the shift in watchmaking  
from fine mechanical engineering to digital displays and thence to digital  
movements. The Swiss watchmaking industry had a long tradition of  
unsurpassed engineering excellence, though often at high price. By the  
late 1970s, though, even its mid-range market had been decimated by  
competition from Japan, using new technologies at a much lower cost. The  
only apparent market that remained was for luxury craftsman watches, and  
even that seemed under threat. In the early 1980s Nicolas Hayek combined  
business restructure, technological innovation, and radically different  
marketing to reframe the Swiss watch industry – most of it under the then-  
new “Swatch” brand – and reclaim its previous preeminent position.  
The market for the new type of watch was a new “Blue Ocean” niche,  
presenting a new concept of the watch as a low-cost, almost transitory  
fashion statement, where the notion of “the watch” is linked less to the  
raw function of timekeeping than as a statement about identity and self.  
Watches and watch-straps can also be customized for the individual,  
creating a sub-market similar to that in the MyM&Ms example here. In  
recent years, Swatch has extended the same concept to watches designed  
specifically for children, under their Flik-Flak brand. In effect, all of this is  
actually closer in concept to the “luxury” end of the market\: both types of  
market are more about an emotive or aspirational relationship to time or  
with time, rather than solely about timekeeping itself.  
New technology included the use of plastics, ceramics, and ultrasonic  
welding, underpinned by a Deming-type continuous-improvement  
approach to manufacturing and reduction of number of components. This  
experience was also carefully echoed back into the legacy Swiss-watch  
industry, retaining its “craft” focus but combined with lessons learned  
from bulk manufacture.  
264 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
The marketing for each of the Swatch sub-markets is different, though  
they do seem to use the same overall enterprise vision – in other words,  
using a “shared-services consortium” enterprise structure. There does not  
seem to be any explicit vision statement shown on their website, but from  
the language used for marketing, we could guess it to be something like  
“expressing the joy of time.”  
#  Example 2\: Mars MyM&Ms  
MyM&Ms is a service by global food-manufacturer Mars Incorporated,  
providing a variant of the popular M&Ms chocolate candy that is  
personalized for events such as weddings, birthdays, conferences, and  
more. At the present time, the service is available only in the USA and  
some parts of Europe. The new business is built around a “shared-service  
consortium” type of enterprise structure.  
For Mars, the trigger for what became MyM&Ms was an idea from  
within their Advanced R&D unit, rather than their marketing department.  
The new market – gifts, promotions, and special events for individuals  
and event organizers – is significantly different from the regular market  
for M&Ms – retail candies/sweets for foods wholesalers. However, it  
leverages strongly from the main market on the basis that the underlying  
product is well-known\: in fact, the unique selling proposition for MyM&Ms  
largely depends on the idea that this is a special personalized version of  
something that is otherwise not new and different.  
The technology is much the same as in the main market\: real-time  
labeling of mass-produced product. The main difference is that the new  
version of the labeling technology permits mass personalization. This is  
then linked to a website that enables creation of the customized label,  
and that manages ordering, payment, fulfillment, and delivery of the  
personalized product. The market could not exist without this mass-  
personalization technology.  
265 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
The core enterprise for MyM&Ms is significantly different from that  
of the main Mars company. Although the enterprises are related, the  
focus here is on personalization rather than on the underlying product –  
a point emphasized by the fact that Mars are also beginning to provide  
mass personalization for some of their other products. A “shared-services  
consortium” enterprise structure is implied by the fact the M&Ms website  
is separate from the main Mars Incorporated website\: the background  
enterprise focuses on manufacture of the base product, which is passed  
to the MyM&Ms front-facing enterprise for personalized labeling and  
delivery to individuals, and to the main Mars front-facing enterprise for  
standard labeling and delivery to food wholesalers.  
In recent years, the “MyM&Ms” term has been phased out in favor of  
the original “M&Ms” term, supported by the provision of a product-  
specific personalized M&Ms website. The M&Ms website shows a three-  
part tagline of “celebrate the moment\: we believe in celebrations of all  
kinds – big and small. Memories happen in moments where we care and  
share with each other.” It presents its vision, described as its mission, as  
“We believe in championing the power of fun to create a world where  
everyone feels they belong.”  
#  Example 3\: Play-Doh  
Play-Doh is a non-toxic, non-staining, reusable modeling compound, used  
by children in 75 countries around the world. The business is now based  
on a “unitary-enterprise” structure.  
For Cincinatti-based soap-manufacturer Kutol Products, the trigger  
for the creation of Play-Doh was a request in 1955 from a school teacher,  
a relative of the company founders, for a substitute for modeling clay  
that would be safe and fun to use. They sent her a sample of an existing  
compound used to clean wallpaper, which the children then used to  
266 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
make Christmas decorations. The response was such that the company  
recognized that the compound could be repurposed as a product they  
could sell to parents and children.  
The new market was fundamentally different from the existing one\:  
from trade cleaning products to children’s toys.  
The technology in use is essentially the same for both markets. In later  
developments, the Play-Doh formula included colorants and changes to  
improve plasticity, but the basic bulk-mixing technology remained almost  
identical.  
The new enterprise is radically different in the two markets\: on  
one side, an enterprise vision of something like “effective and reliable  
cleaning for the building trade”; on the other, more like “safe and fun  
modeling” – an enterprise vision which also does not restrict the market  
solely to parents and their children. Although the base technology was  
largely unchanged, the two enterprises were so different that it mandated  
a “shared-services consortium” overarching enterprise structure for the  
organization. Eventually the divergences and differences in markets  
became so extreme that the Play-Doh division was sold off as a separate  
company, with the latter’s own enterprise centered around the toy  
industry. Meanwhile, the original parent-company Kutol continues as a  
manufacturer of cleaning products, reverting to a “unitary-enterprise”  
structure focused on hand hygiene.  
#  Example 4\: Oceaneering Animatronics  
Oceaneering is a large engineering company specializing in hydraulics,  
control systems, and remote-operated vehicles for harsh or extreme  
environments including deepwater, defense, and aerospace. The provision  
of animatronics for theme parks at first seemed to be a surprise addition  
to their portfolio, initially causing a disconnect across the enterprise  
structure, but has now settled back into a straightforward “shared-services  
consortium” type of structure.  
267 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
Oceaneering describes the trigger for the new market for  
entertainment-industry systems as “a call for help” from a theme-park  
engineering team who were having difficulty maintaining large  
animatronic “creatures” that needed to operate partly underwater.  
Functionally, the new market is similar to the old, namely, specialist  
engineering applications for hydraulic technologies and control systems.  
The main challenge was that the organization had been positioned as a  
provider primarily for the deepwater-oilfield industry, and at the time had  
not fully set itself up to work across multiple markets.  
The technology involved was broadly the same as for their main  
deepwater-engineering market\: hydraulic and other actuators,  
control systems, and so on, to be repurposed into animatronics and  
hydrodynamics.  
Because the organization had positioned itself with the oil-industry  
enterprise, the engagement into an animatronics and entertainment-industry  
enterprise at first exacerbated an already-existing enterprise  
disruption that had arisen from the previous inclusion of engineering  
services for aerospace. This risked falling into a “conglomerate-consortium”  
enterprise structure in which both aerospace and  
animatronics would be “second-class citizens” in the organization’s  
portfolio, and in which the unifying theme for the conglomerate would  
be little more than the organization’s name. This situation was reflected  
in the organization’s website during the early 2010s, in which its services  
for the aerospace industry were barely mentioned, and those for the  
entertainment industry were not mentioned at all, despite providing  
a sizeable proportion of the organization’s business. More recently  
there seems to have been a major shift, such that all industries that the  
organization now serves are listed on the current website, with specialist  
engineering as the unifying theme. This would enable a “shared-services  
consortium” enterprise structure, where the focus on special-purpose  
268 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
engineering provides both the unifying theme and the background  
services shared by all of the organization’s market-specific subsidiary  
enterprises.  
#  Example 5\: Nokia  
At the present, Nokia presents itself as provider of hardware, software, and  
research on communications technology and information systems. Given  
the organization’s history, that might well change to something completely  
different at any point in the future – because Nokia is perhaps the most  
extreme example of an organization that has mutated and reinvented itself  
and its enterprise many times over the decades.  
Nokia started out in the mid-1860s as a lumber company, named after  
the town in which it was located.  
In the 1900s it moved into the new market for electricity generation.  
This would have required significant changes in technology. The trigger for  
that change was recognition of market opportunity.  
In the 1910s, Nokia was essentially taken over by another company,  
a rubber-products manufacturer, which later, in the 1920s, acquired a  
cable manufacturer. The trigger for the first change seems to have been  
commercial opportunity, retaining the organization’s name because of  
the location; the trigger for the later acquisition would probably have been  
driven by parallel interests, in that rubber products would have been used  
for electrical insulation. In both cases, the new technology was related to  
and supported the technology of the previous enterprise.  
In the 1930s, and onward into and beyond Finland’s engagement  
in the Second World War, Nokia changed into more of “conglomerate-consortium”  
type of enterprise structure, spread across multiple markets  
that included products such as paper, bicycle and car tires, footwear,  
cables, televisions and other consumer electronics, electricity-generation  
equipment, communications equipment, plastics, aluminum, and  
269 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
chemicals. The trigger for each of these expansions is not clear, and in  
some cases the new technology would have been radically different from  
that already in use. There was some enterprise continuity, though, in that  
all of these products and related business lines can be traced back to the  
four historical roots of the corporation, in lumber, electricity generation,  
rubber, and cables.  
However, the spread of market and scope of enterprise had become too  
broad to be sustainable, becoming a trigger for major financial losses in the  
late 1970s and early 1980s that brought the organization close to complete  
collapse.  
This in turn became a trigger for further fundamental change for the  
organization. To enable its recovery during the late 1980s and 1990s, Nokia  
divested its rubber, cable, footwear, and consumer-electronics divisions  
and refocused itself on the enterprise and market for telecommunications.  
Continuing along that path, Nokia had, by the early 2000s, established  
itself as probably the leading brand in the global market for consumer  
cellphones and related telecommunications systems. At that time, its  
website summarized its enterprise with the tagline “connecting people”;  
its stated core values were defined as “Engaging You, Achieving Together,  
Passion for Innovation, Very Human.”  
In the 2010s, a new trigger for change arose when the market for  
basic cellphones was decimated by the rise of smartphones from Apple,  
Samsung, and others. Nokia was forced to reinvent itself yet again,  
slowly abandoning the consumer-oriented \(B2C\) cellphone side of its  
operations, and instead refocusing on the business and government \(B2B\)  
market for telecommunications infrastructure and related hardware  
applications such as robotics and internet-of-things. The underlying  
technology for the new enterprise would have been essentially the same  
as for the old one, though with continual updates and innovations to  
match the changing needs of that market. On its present website, Nokia  
summarizes its enterprise with the phrase “We create technology that helps  
the world act together” as its vision statement, followed a summary of its  
270 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
perceived enterprise role as “We are a B2B technology innovation leader in  
networking, bringing together the world’s people, machines, and devices  
to realize the potential of digital in every industry.”  
The Nokia history indicates the challenges that can arise when an  
organization undergoes growth, expansion, and change without an  
explicit form of enterprise identity to guide choices about what should or  
should not be included in its structure and story. Without that anchor, as  
can be seen in the Nokia example during the period from the late 1970s  
to mid-1980s, the organization’s identity and enterprise will begin to  
fragment over time, causing a loss of clarity and focus, in turn leading to  
excessive tensions across the entire organization. The break-up of the  
unstable “conglomerate-consortium” enterprise structure in the late 1980s  
and 1990s was a necessary foundation for its later growth, because each  
remaining sub-unit and its market could then be aligned with a more-clearly  
defined enterprise vision, enabling a “shared-services consortium”  
enterprise structure.  
Interestingly, the one constant unifying theme across all of its  
enterprise reinventions is the location of its home base\: the town and  
municipality of Nokia, in southwestern Finland.  
#  Into Action  
Once your business-transformation project is well on its way, you’ll want  
to engage executives and strategy teams in using ideas from Enterprise  
Canvas to help them prepare for what might need to happen when the next  
major change comes through. Use the examples in this chapter and the  
following questions to help you guide those conversations\:  
•  
What major changes do you see in your own  
organization’s history? In each case, what was the  
trigger for the change? What differences in technology,  
market, and/or enterprise were required by the change,  
271 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
•  
•  
•  
•  
or used to drive the change? How did those differences  
ripple down through each of the services that underpin  
the organization and its business?  
How might you use a change in technology to trigger  
a change within your own organization? What  
implications might that have for your organization’s  
market and/or its enterprise definition – its vision,  
values, success criteria, and applicable regulations  
and standards and the like – or the type of enterprise  
structure required to make the change work?  
How might you use a change in market to trigger  
a change within your own organization? What  
implications might that have for your organization’s  
technology and/or its enterprise definition or enterprise  
structure?  
How might you use a change in enterprise definition  
and/or enterprise structure to trigger a change within  
your own organization? What implications might  
that have for your organization’s technology and/or  
its market?  
In each case, how would those desired changes affect  
the design, operation, and governance for each of the  
organization’s internal and external-facing services and  
products?  
272 Chapter 17 Rethinking Vision Bottom-Up  
#  Summary  
In this final chapter, we explored how enterprise structure can be used  
to enable a single organization to serve multiple, disparate markets. To  
illustrate this, we reviewed five real-world examples where an organization  
either chose or was forced to reinvent itself via a change in technology,  
market, and/or enterprise, in each case necessitating a bottom-up or  
sideways-out re-evaluation of the enterprise vision and values that were  
used to embed the change into the organization and hold everything  
together.

The Business Model Canvas \(BMC\) is a popular framework for  
developing business models. It was originally developed by Alex  
Osterwalder and published in his book Business Model Generation.  
Although mainly intended for developing business models for for-profit  
organizations, it can also be used for equivalent models for government,  
not-for-profit, and other types of organizations. It is also the de-rigueur  
standard in the startup community for defining and shaping the early  
stages of a startup. The standard version of the Canvas is as shown in  
Figure B-1.

In essence, it is an organization-centric view into an enterprise supply  
chain, organized around a business model as the delivery of a value  
proposition to a set of customer segments. The BMC is largely compatible  
with Enterprise Canvas, although there are some significant conceptual  
differences\:  
•  
The BMC definition of “value proposition” is viewed  
only from the organization’s perspective – “the bundle  
of products and services that create value for a specific  
284 Appendix B Working with Business-Model Canvas  
Customer Segment” – and is not necessarily anchored  
in the vision and values of any broader shared  
enterprise.  
•  
The model focuses on only one node in a value web,  
between a single organization and its customers.  
•  
The model is asymmetric in that it describes the  
relationships and transactions with customers in detail  
\(Customer Relations, Channels, Revenue Streams\),  
while relationship transactions with suppliers \(Key  
Partners\) are not.  
•  
The model describes value primarily in monetary  
terms \(Revenue Streams, Cost Structure\).  
•  
In Service-Layers terms, the BMC model sits at the  
Row-2 to Row-3 level – relationships and abstract  
attributes – without any direct means to move from  
abstract model into realizable services and run-time  
operations in Row-4, Row-5, and Row-6.  
Because of these differences, a business model in BMC format will  
always need some translation and expansion into other model types to  
make the model realizable in practice.  
Overall, it is a frame that makes it easy for most people to grasp what’s  
going on in an organization, at least in terms of those aspects that connect  
directly with its business model. It aligns well with the underlying core  
of Enterprise Canvas, because it depicts the business model as a set of  
relationships between interdependent services. Although the two models  
have different roles and emphases, Enterprise Canvas was designed to be  
directly compatible with the BMC, with an intentional similarity of layout  
to make it easy to translate between them using the following step-by-  
step guides.  
285 Appendix B Working with Business-Model Canvas  
#  From Business Model Canvas  
# to Enterprise Canvas  
Develop a business model on the Business Model Canvas, using the  
instructions and guidance in Business Model Generation. Then translate  
from BMC to Enterprise Canvas as follows\:  
•  
Key Partners \[KP\] to one or more “Supplier” blocks.  
•  
Customer Segments \[CS\] to one or more  
“Customer” blocks.  
•  
Customer Relationships \[CR\] to Customer Relations.  
•  
Channels \[CH\] to Customer Channels.  
•  
Revenue Streams \[R\$\] to Value Return.  
•  
Cost Structure \[C\$\] to Value Outlay.  
•  
Value Proposition \[VP\] to Value Proposition.  
•  
Initially, merge Key Resources \[KR\] and Key Activities  
\[KA\] into Value Creation, though some aspects are  
likely to be moved to other cells on detailed analysis.  
These translation connections are summarized in visual form in  
Figure B-2.  
286  
Appendix B Working with Business-Model Canvas  
Figure B-2. Mapping Business-Model Canvas to Enterprise Canvas  
Use text descriptions and any other documentation attached to the  
business model to populate the flows between the core service and its  
suppliers and customers.  
Do a review to check the initial translation. Some aspects may need to  
be split as follows\:  
•  
Some aspects of Key Partners \[KP\] may need to be  
moved to Supplier Relations and/or Supplier Channels  
and/or to the respective flows.  
•  
Some aspects of Cost Structure \[C\$\] may need to be  
moved to the supplier-side return channel.  
•  
Some aspects of Customer Relationships \[CR\], Channels  
\[CH\], and/or Revenue Streams \[R\$\] may need to be  
moved to the respective customer-side flows.  
287 Appendix B Working with Business-Model Canvas  
•  
Governance aspects of Cost Structure \[C\$\] may need to  
be moved to Value Governance.  
•  
Governance aspects of Revenue Streams \[R\$\] may need  
to be moved to Value Governance.  
All aspects of Key Activities \[KA\] and Key Resources \[KR\] should be  
reviewed in terms of service content \(see Chapter 13, “Service Content”\)  
and moved into the respective Enterprise Canvas cells as appropriate.  
The result of the translation should be one or more Row-2 or simplified  
Row-3 Enterprise Canvas models. Use the methods and questions  
described in this book to work with the stakeholders to link the business  
model to its guidance services, investors and beneficiaries, and the vision  
and values of the broader shared enterprise. Expand the model downward  
through the layers of the Service-Layers model, to identify how to bring  
it to real-world implementation and to modify the model as necessary  
according to real-world opportunities, risks, and constraints.  
#  From Enterprise Canvas to Business  
# Model Canvas  
On occasion it may be useful to translate in the opposite direction, from  
Enterprise Canvas to Business Model Canvas, such as for a business  
audience who are known to be familiar with the latter.  
In essence the translation is the reverse of that shown in Figure B-1.  
Start with a simplified Row-3 Enterprise Canvas model. Flows between  
services, and also between cells within the Enterprise Canvas, should be  
described as links between cells on the Business-Model Canvas. Note that  
the translation may not be straightforward in some places, particularly  
on the supplier-side, because of the inherent asymmetry of the Business-  
Model Canvas.  
288  
Appendix B Working with Business-Model Canvas  
Some decisions will be needed to simplify service content into the  
BMC Key Resources \[KR\] and Key Activities \[KA\] cells. As a guideline\:  
•  
Service-content assets and locations go into Key  
Resources \[KR\].  
•  
Service-content functions go into Key Activities \[KA\].  
•  
Service-content capabilities and decisions may end up  
in either cell as appropriate.  
•  
Service-content events can be reframed as links  
between cells.  
“Round-tripping” between Enterprise Canvas and Business-Model  
Canvas can be problematic because information may be lost when  
translating from Enterprise Canvas – particularly about guidance,  
investors, and flows. Often the only way to carry this information through  
to a Business-Model Canvas is via text annotations and hand-drawn links.  
Hence, although round-tripping is possible here, do be aware of the risks  
as well as the advantages.  
289  APPENDIX C  
# Enterprise Canvas  
# Notation  
What notation should we use for Enterprise Canvas models? Chapter 1, “What Is the  
Enterprise Canvas?” provides two practical options for this\: a simple sketch format that  
works well for roughing out ideas on paper or a whiteboard, and a more formal style  
that can be used in diagramming tools such as Visio on Windows, or Omnigraffle for  
Mac OS.  
This appendix describes another option\: a notation that can be  
used within toolsets for service architecture and service design, that is  
compatible with UML and other UML-derived notations such as BPMN  
and Archimate. This notation supports formal rigor and model validation  
and can be implemented directly in many toolsets via a UML profile.  
Figure C-1 provides a visual summary of this toolset-compatible notation.

291 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-1. Enterprise Canvas  
Summary of toolset-compatible notation for  
This notation is comprised of the following items\:  
•  
Two main entity types\: Service and Product  
•  
Three subsidiary entity types\: Vision, Value, and Element  
•  
Three relation types\: Flow, composition, and realization  
The three subsidiary entity types are used only in the topmost rows of  
the Service-Layers model, and are largely optional for most modeling for  
Enterprise Canvas.  
Optionally, UML-style descriptive items such as “Group” or  
“Annotation” may also be used, and other relation types such as the  
general-purpose association relation, but they are not required, and are  
not defined as such within the notation syntax.  
292 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
#  Entity Types  
The entities most used for modeling with Enterprise Canvas are Service,  
denoting a node of activity, and Product, denoting what passes between  
services. There are also three special-purpose entities\: Vision and Value,  
used only in the Row-0 Enterprise topmost layer of abstraction; and  
Element, used only in the Row-1 Scope layer.  
As described here, there is a recommended default graphic for each  
entity type; but if the toolset can support such an option, alternative  
graphics may be used instead. This is often useful to support better  
understanding of a service model, particularly when applied to Service or  
Product entities.  
#   
**“*Vision*” and “*Value*” Entity Types**  
As described in Chapter 4, “Service Vision and Values,” the vision and its  
concomitant values are the ultimate anchors for everything that happens  
in the shared enterprise. Or, to put it the other way round, every service  
and product must in some way help toward the realizing of the shared-  
enterprise vision and its values.  
The Vision and Value entities, as shown in Figure C-2, should appear  
only in models that describe Row-0 Enterprise and are the only entities  
that should appear in that layer. For most purposes, only one Vision should  
be used\: multiple Vision entities should only be used for the special case  
of assessing clashes between multiple shared enterprises impacting on an  
organization.  
293 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-2. “Vision” and “Value” entities  
Any number of Value entities may be attached to a Vision via  
composition relations.  
Toolset implementation\: For the Vision entity, use a rounded-ends  
lozenge shape or, for compatibility with Archimate, the cloud shape used  
for the Archimate “Meaning” entity. For the Value entity, use an oval  
shape, for compatibility with the Archimate “Value” entity.  
Alternatively, for the Vision entity, use the same graphic as for a Service  
entity, because the vision represents the overall service that the shared  
enterprise provides to the world; and, for a Value entity, use the same  
graphic as for a Product entity, because all products are asset types, and a  
value associated with a vision represents an aspirational type asset.  
#   
**“*Element*” Entity Type**  
As described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,” the service content that arises  
from the simple interrogatives in Row-1 Scope should be categorized and  
listed as “elements.” These elements are then used as the initial source and  
cross-checks for service content in Row-2 to Row-6.  
The Element entity, as shown in Figure C-3, should appear only in  
models that include Row-1 Scope and are the only entities that should  
appear in that layer.  
294 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-3. “Element” entity  
A Row-1 model may include any number of Element entities. Where a  
Row-0 Enterprise layer is shown in the model, each Element entity must be  
connected via realization relations to the Vision entity and, optionally, to  
any number of Value entities.  
Toolset implementation\: For the Element entity, use a vertically  
oriented rectangle, or, for compatibility with Archimate, the rectangle-  
with-horizontal line used for the Archimate “Business-Object” entity.  
#   
**“*Service*” Entity Type**  
As described in Chapter 2, “The Nature of Service,” everything within  
an enterprise either is, represents, or implies a service. In modeling  
with Enterprise Canvas, anything that does something – the service in  
focus, its “child” services, its suppliers and customers, its investors and  
beneficiaries, and the services that coordinate, direct and validate it –  
should all be represented as instances of the Service entity type.  
The Service entity, as shown in Figure C-4, should appear only in  
models that include Row-2 Business Model, Row-3 Service Model, Row-4  
Design Model, and/or Row-5 Deployment Model. Service and Product are  
the only entity types that should be present in those layers.  
295 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-4. “Service” entity  
Parameters and parameter values for the internal and structural  
content for a service represented by a Service entity would depend  
somewhat on the abstraction layer being represented, as described in  
Chapter 13, “Service Content.” Descriptions of the respective service  
content should be attached to or embedded within that Service entity.  
A Row-2 to Row-5 model may include any number of Service entities.  
See the “Relation Types” section later in this chapter for the rules that  
govern how to depict relationships between services and other types of  
entities.  
Toolset implementation\: For the Service entity, use a rounded-rectangle  
graphic, for compatibility with the Archimate “Business Service” entity and  
UML or BPMN “Activity” entity.  
Include content descriptions for service content and other parameters  
as required, and as supported by the respective toolset in use; as a  
minimum, ensure that each Service entity has an appropriate “name”  
parameter as its identifier.  
#   
**“*Product*” Entity Type**  
As described in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” a product is or represents  
anything that is passed between services, or that is used to bridge a  
gap between services. In modeling with Enterprise Canvas, these are  
represented as instances of the Product entity type.  
The Product entity, as shown in Figure C-5, should appear only in  
models that include Row-2 Business Model, Row-3 Service Model, Row-4  
Design Model, Row-5 Deployment Model, and/or Row-6 Action Record.  
296 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Product and Service are the only entity types that should be present in  
the Row-2 to Row-5 layers; Product is the only entity type that should be  
present in the Row-6 layer.  
Figure C-5. “Product” entity  
Parameters and parameter values for the internal and structural  
content for a product represented by a Product entity would depend  
somewhat on the abstraction layer being represented, as described in  
Chapter 13, “Service Content.” Descriptions of the respective product  
content should be attached to or embedded within that Product entity.  
A Row-2 to Row-6 model may include any number of Product entities.  
See the “Relation Types” section later in this chapter for the rules that  
govern how to depict relationships between products and other types of  
entities.  
Toolset implementation\: For the Product entity, use a “document”  
image as a default graphic, for compatibility with the UML “Activity Object”  
\(“Document”\) entity and BPMN “Data Object” entity. Alternatively, use  
the same nominal entity type, but attach or embed any other graphic or  
symbol that better represent the asset types and structural content of the  
respective product\: for example, a box for physical objects, a book page  
for information, a stick figure for relations, or a flash for brands and other  
aspirational assets.  
Include content descriptions for product content and other parameters  
as required, and as supported by the respective toolset in use; as a  
minimum, ensure that each Product entity has an appropriate “name”  
parameter as its identifier.  
297 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

#  Relation Types  
The notation for Enterprise Canvas uses just three relation types\: flow,  
composition, and realization. Other possible relation types may be  
considered to be specializations of one or other of these three types.  
#   
**“*Flow*” Relation Type**  
As described in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” services are connected to each  
other by flow relations. Each flow will be associated with one or more  
products that are either passed along the flow, or indicate how the gap  
between services will be bridged.  
A flow should be represented by a flow relation type, a “horizontal”  
dotted-line connection with an arrow indicating the main direction of flow  
or relationship, as shown in Figure C-6. For flow relations in which there is  
no emphasized direction of flow, an arrowhead should be shown at both  
ends of the flowline.  
Figure C-6. “Flow” relation type  
For more on how to show a product in an actual flow relationship  
between services, versus a product that only provides a bridge across  
a gap between services, see the section “Alternate Modeling for  
*Product* Entities Within Flows” later in this appendix.  
298 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
A flow relation should appear only in models that include Row-2  
Business Model, Row-3 Service Model, Row-4 Design Model, and/or  
Row-5 Deployment Model. They should also link only across one Row or  
layer of abstraction\: they cannot and must not be used to link between  
services and/or products in different layers. Other connection rules for  
flow relations are as follows\:  
•  
A flow relation may link a Service entity to another  
Service entity.  
•  
A flow relation may link a Service entity to a Product  
entity, or a Product entity to a Service entity.  
In Row-3, Row-4, and Row-5 layers, each flow should also take  
on a distinct role, representing the Enterprise-Canvas inter-service  
relationships, as follows\:  
•  
Provide\: Simple provision of products and services,  
used to link with other services in Supplier and  
Customer relationships to this service \(a Supplier  
is a source for or “provides” a flow; a Customer is a  
destination for or “consumes” a flow\).  
•  
Invest\: A flow from a service in an Investor relationship  
to this service.  
•  
Benefit\: A flow to a service in a Beneficiary relationship  
to this service.  
•  
Coordinate\: A flow or exchange with a service in a  
Coordination guidance relationship to this service.  
•  
Direct\: A flow or exchange with a service in a Direction  
guidance relationship to this service.  
•  
Validate\: A flow or exchange with a service in a  
Validation guidance relationship to this service.  
299 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

An open or “unspecified” role should be assigned to all flow relations  
shown in a Row-2 layer and may also be assigned to any flow relations in  
Row-3 to Row-5 layers for the role has not yet been determined.  
Toolset implementation\: For compatibility with Archimate, BPMN,  
and UML, a flow relation should be represented by a dotted-line ending  
in a solid arrowhead at one end, to indicate the primary direction of the  
flow, as shown in Figure C-7, or at both ends if the flow is essentially  
bidirectional.  
Figure C-7. “Flow” line  
Parameters for a flow relation may include an identifier for the role \(if  
any\), and, optionally, a name for the flow, a description of the triggering  
events for the flow, a description of flow content \(if no Product entity is  
attached\), and any other relevant information.  
#   
**“*Composition*” Relation Type**  
As described in Chapter 12, “Service Decomposition,” we often need to  
model the structural composition or make-up of a service or product. For  
example, in Enterprise Canvas we describe each service as being made  
up of nine subsidiary “child” services, as its means for tackling the distinct  
service requirements and flows for a matrix of inbound-facing, self and  
outbound-facing focus, before, during, and after each main transaction  
across the service as a whole.  
Note that those are merely the default partitionings used in Enterprise  
Canvas, and any appropriate alternate partitioning for a service or  
product may be used instead.  
300 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
The same principle applies to products, which may be composed or  
aggregated from any number of “child” products, each with their own  
mix of underlying asset types. We can then model these composition  
relationships in two different ways\: by connection links, or by  
“containment,” as shown in Figure C-9.  
Figure C-8. Composition\: “composition”-relation connection links  
To show composition via connection links, use a composition relation  
type, a “vertical” solid arrow with a diamond-shaped head connected to  
the “parent,” as shown in Figure C-8.  
A composition relation should appear only in models that include  
Row-2 Business Model, Row-3 Service Model, Row-4 Design Model, Row-5  
Deployment Model, and/or Row-6 Action Record. For most purposes, they  
should link only across one Row or layer of abstraction\: in general, they  
cannot and must not be used to link between entities in different layers.  
The exception to that guideline occurs when modeling a context  
where some implementation choices have already been made while  
others remain undecided – for example, some items are in Row-4  
while others are still in Row-3. For more detail on how to model that  
type of situation, see the section “Modeling Implicit Layer Transitions  
in ‘Containment’ Views” later in this appendix.  
301 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

With one exception – Value as a component of Vision – all composition  
relationships must connect between entities of the same type. The  
connection rules for composition relations are as follows\:  
•  
A composition relation may link a Value entity to a  
Vision entity.  
•  
A composition relation may link a Value entity to  
another Value entity.  
•  
A composition relation may link an Element entity to  
another Element entity.  
•  
A composition relation may link a Service entity to  
another Service entity.  
•  
A composition relation may link a Product entity to  
another Product entity.  
A composition relation should always indicate which entity is the  
“parent” in the relationship, versus the entities that represent the  
“child” components. The recommended notation for a connection-type  
composition relation, as shown in Figure C-8, is a solid arrow with a  
diamond head pointing to the “parent.”  
In some cases, it may be useful to annotate a *composition* relation  
in Row-3 or below as denoting an *aggregation*, *assignment*, or  
*uses/used-by* relationship\: for these, use the respective Archimate  
line decoration of open diamond, dot, and line arrow, connected  
to the “parent.” In Enterprise Canvas, though, do note that these  
are regarded only as variants or sub-types of composition and  
decomposition; this is not the same as the approach used in  
Archimate and uml, where these sub-types are all defined as  
different relation types.  
302 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Also, do take especial care when using a *composition* relation to  
emulate an Archimate “*assigned-to*” or “*uses/used-by*” relationship\:  
those are often used in Archimate as an analogue of a *realization*  
relation that will link between Archimate’s content-based “layers”  
of Business, Application, and Technology, but at the *same* level of  
abstraction. For more on potential modeling risks that may arise from  
this difference in approach, see the section “Problems with Content-  
Based Layering” later in this appendix.  
Figure C-9. Composition\: containment  
To show composition by containment, place one or more entities  
“inside” another entity, as shown in Figure C-9. All entities in a  
containment relationship must be of the same entity type\: containment  
should not be used to depict relationships between a Vision entity and its  
Value entities.  
Toolset implementation\: For compatibility with Archimate, BPMN, and  
UML, a connection-type composition relation should be represented by a  
vertical solid-line arrow ending in a solid diamond-type arrowhead at one  
end, as shown in Figure C-10, pointing to the “parent in the relationship.”  
303 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-10. Composition line  
For any usage of the composition subtypes *aggregation*, *assignment*,  
or *used-by* \(“serving”\), use open diamond, solid dot, or line arrow for  
the respective line decoration.  
Parameters for a composition relation may include an identifier for the  
role \(if any\), and, optionally, a name for the composition relationship, and  
any other relevant information.  
If the toolset supports containment-type composition relations,  
the containment should be represented within the toolset by a Service,  
Product, or Element entity shown as containing other entities of the same  
respective type.  
#   
**“*Realization*” Relation Type**  
As described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers” the Service-Layers model  
describes a set of layers of abstraction that specify the type of content,  
and level of detail for that content, required for descriptions of service  
models that represent the respective Row or layer. The layers also connect  
vertically from big-picture intent to real-world action and outcomes, such  
that a model in a given layer is described as a “realization” of the respective  
model in the layer above. For example, a “logical” implementation-  
independent model in the Row-3 Service-Model layer realizes, or makes  
more concrete, the support for a business need or business service  
described in the respective “business-context” model in the Row-2  
304 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Business-Model layer; a “physical” implementation-specific design in the  
Row-4 Design-Model layer realizes a possible implementation for that  
“logical” service; and so on.  
Note that a *realization* relation is “vertical” – it links *only* between  
layers of abstraction. If we’re working only within one layer in terms  
of the Service Layers, we won’t need or use any *realization* relations  
in our model.  
Note also that *realization* relations can only link *between* Rows  
or layers of abstraction\: they cannot and must not be used to link  
between entities in the same layer. To link between entities at the  
same layer of abstraction, always use a *flow* relation or *composition*  
relation\: a *realization* relation should never be used for this purpose.  
We also use these realization relationships between models in different  
layers to denote and map out trails of provenance or “Why,” looking  
“upward” through the layers, and trails of derivation or “How,” looking  
“downward” through the layers. For example, the Row-3 “logical service”  
is the reason or “Why” for the existence of the Row-4 “physical service”;  
the Row-2 “business service” is the reason for the existence of the Row-3  
“logical service”; and so on, all the way upward to the Row-0 shared-  
enterprise vision.  
A realization relationship between models should be represented by a  
realization relation between the matching entities in the respective layers,  
in the form of a “vertical” dotted-line connection with an open-triangle  
arrowhead connecting to the entity in the “upper” \(lower-numbered\) Row,  
as shown in Figure C-11.  
305 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-11. “Realization” relation  
As noted earlier, a realization relationship may also be implied in  
some cases where containment is used to represent composition  
relationships. For more detail on this, see the section “Modeling  
Implicit Layer Transitions in “containment” Views” later in this  
appendix.  
Also, again, take especial care when emulating an Archimate  
“realization” relation. For more detail on this, see the section  
“Problems with Content-Based Layering” later in this appendix.  
A realization relation may be used to connect between separate-  
but-related entities within any pair of layers or Rows, as appropriate.  
Connection rules for realization relations are as follows\:  
•  
•  
A realization relation may link a Service, Product,  
or Element entity “upward” to a Vision entity or  
Value entity.  
A realization relation may link a Service or Product  
entity “upward” to an Element entity.  
306 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
•  
A realization relation may link a Service entity “upward”  
to another Service entity.  
•  
A realization relation may link a Product entity  
“upward” to another Product entity.  
There are no sub-types for realization relations.  
Toolset implementation\: For compatibility with Archimate, BPMN, and  
UML, a realization relation should be represented by a vertical dotted-  
line ending in an open-triangle arrowhead at the upper end, as shown in  
Figure C-12.  
Figure C-12. Realization line  
Parameters for a realization relation may include an optional name  
and an optional text description of the context for the realization.  
#  General Notes on Modeling  
Do be aware of the purpose and limits of this toolset-compatible notation  
for Enterprise Canvas. Much like Archimate for IT architectures, it  
is primarily intended to support “just enough modeling” to provide  
architectural overviews and to guide discussions on service design. It is  
easy to use, and does cover all of the main features of the Canvas, but it is  
not intended for full-detail design\: for example, it does not have any built-  
in support for modeling the internal content and structure for products  
and services, as described in Chapter 13, “Service Content.” It does allow  
some degree of support for automated syntax-checking and validation  
307 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

at the entity level, but it does require that more responsibility for correct  
modeling of underlying detail is passed to the modeler rather than explicit  
in the notation.  
By default, colors for entities and flows are not semantically significant.  
Use color in any way that suits the meaning best.  
Use flow and composition relations only within layers of abstraction \(rows\);  
use realization relations only between rows.  
** Alternate Modeling for *Product* Entities**  
# Within Flows  
The Product entities represent whatever will be passed, or act as a bridge,  
across a flow-relation-ship between Service entities.  
In the standard modeling usage described above, the Product is placed  
between Service entities, and the flow relation links directly to the Product  
on both the “incoming” and “outgoing” side, as shown in Figure C-13.  
Figure C-13. Inline “Product” entity  
This is probably the best way to model Product entities if we want to  
show actual flows of physical and/or virtual assets, or else if we need to  
focus on what a service would want produce as its output, and then go  
looking for other services that might consume that inter-service content.  
If we are more interested in modeling relationships between services,  
particularly those where relational and/or aspirational assets provide the  
content to bridge the gap between those services, it may be better to attach  
the respective Product entity to the respective flow relation, rather than  
visibly interposing it in the flow, as shown in Figure C-14.  
308 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-14. Attached Product entity  
The disadvantage of the “attached-Product” option is that it is not well  
suited to showing a decomposition split of the Product into subsidiary  
“child”-Product items linked to the attached “parent” via composition  
relations\: visually it becomes too cluttered, and hard to read. If we need  
to show composition and decomposition for Product entities between  
services, we should use the in-flow format instead.  
#  Modeling Implicit Layer Transitions  
# in “Containment” Views  
As described earlier in the section on the composition relation type,  
containment provides a useful technique to save space in model diagrams  
and to reduce visual clutter for composition relations. An entity can be  
shown as “containing” other entities of the same type, which then implies  
that the “child” entities have composition relations with the “parent.”  
In Enterprise Canvas, this type of containment is implied in the  
subdivision of the core Service entity into nine subsidiary cells, as shown  
in Figure C-15.  
309 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

Figure C-15. A Service contains “child” Services  
It is also implied in the “before/during/after” split of the inter-service  
flow, as represented by the “wrapper” Product entity for the overall  
supplier-side flow in the model shown in Figure C-16.  
Figure C-16. Service Product exchanges  
Using a container entity in this way is usually less cluttered and easier  
to read than modeling the same Product flows with composition links, as  
shown in Figure C-17.  
310 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-17. Unpacked “containment” of “child” Services  
However, do beware that in some cases, an apparent composition  
containment may also need to imply realization relationships together  
with the composition relationships. One common example would be  
where we want to show which decisions have been made regarding  
implementation of the components for a service – such as a Row-3  
Service entity containing a set of “child”-Service entities that are a mix of  
Row-3 implementation-undefined and Row-4 implementation-specific.  
If we want to model use containment to model that context, we need to  
distinguish between the implied composition relations of the containment,  
versus any realization relations needed between the “parent” and any of its  
“children.”  
One way to do this would be to use the same dotted-line convention  
of a realization relation to also denote a realization relationship within  
a compositional containment. We use solid-line boundary for a Service  
entity or Product entity to denote a “child” that is in the same Row or  
layer as its “parent”; we use a dotted-line boundary to indicate that the  
is not in the same layer as its parent. The usual recommendation is that  
311 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

entities in the “more-real” layer should be the ones marked with a dotted-  
line boundary\: in the example shown in Figure C-18, a solid-line border  
represents Row-3, and a dashed border represents Row-4.  
Figure C-18. Containment and “realization” relations  
Some toolsets may be able to manage this notation automatically, but  
in almost all cases we should be able to do this manually if required.  
#  Problems with Content-Based Layering  
A reminder may again be needed here that the layers or “rows” in the  
Service-Layers model for Enterprise Canvas are layers of abstraction, not  
content-based layers such as used in TOGAF, Archimate, and other IT-  
oriented frameworks and notations.  
Content-based layering can be problematic because it can make it  
almost impossible to model in any consistent way certain essential aspects  
of enterprise architectures and service design. In particular, this applies  
to planning for business continuity and disaster recovery, for security-  
system design, for load-balancing, and for anything else that might require  
“fungibility” or substitution of some method or content for another that  
uses a different asset type, decision type, or technology.  
For example, Archimate’s architecture model defines three content-  
based layers\: “Technology,” which describes the physical elements for  
IT infrastructure; “Application,” which describes elements that deal with  
312 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
data, and anything that works on data; and “Business,” which provides  
the context for the technology, applications, and data, and also describes  
any elements that are not IT-based technology, applications, or data. It  
then uses a myriad of different entities and relationships in and/or these  
different content-based layers to denote the differences between Row-3  
“logical”-type concepts and their respective Row-4 “physical”-type real-  
world implementations. In practice, though, we can only get away with  
that kind of content-based layering if and only if our service designs  
work only with IT applications, IT-based data, and IT hardware. There is  
no way to use it to do consistent modeling for any other types of service  
implementations.  
To illustrate why this can be so problematic, consider the following  
service-design example. In the ZapaMex factory, there is a storage area  
that contains dangerous chemicals, and by law they must ensure that  
only authorized people can access that area. In Enterprise Canvas, that  
requirement would be placed in a Row-3 Service Model; in Archimate, it  
would be placed in the “Business” layer, probably as a “Business-service”  
element. All of that would seem straightforward enough at first.  
Yet real problems could arise for ZapaMex when they try to model how  
they might implement that service. For example, they decide that they  
will fit to the door an electronic lock that could be opened by a fingerprint  
scanner or RFID tag or, if the power fails, by a physical key; if the lock  
itself fails, they will assign someone to act as a guard to control access.  
For Enterprise Canvas, we would model these at Row-4 Design Model, as  
different implementations or realizations of the same Row-3 service and its  
respective assets, function, location, capability, events, and decisions, all  
relating to the same service user. But if we try to model this in Archimate,  
the content-based layering would place the IT-based fingerprint scanner  
in the Application layer, the physical key in the Technology layer, and  
the human guard in the Business layer – and there is no means there to  
show that they are, in fact, just different implementations of the same  
service. These inconsistencies then ripple and multiply across the entire  
313 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  

architecture of the enterprise, until it becomes impossible to trace any  
trails of provenance or interdependence, or what requirement anything  
serves, or even why anything exists. Content-based layering is not the same  
as layers of abstraction or realization, and it is essential not to mix them up.  
#  Keeping Things Simple  
Remember that one of the key aims here is to keep things simple, without  
ever dropping down into the over-simplistic. Other than the special-case  
entities for Row-0 and Row-1, there are only main two entity types in  
the entire notation\: Service, which does something; and Product, which  
represents something that passes between services. That’s it.  
There are then only three types of relationship possible between those  
entities, which in turn follow very simple rules\:  
•  
Composition relations, showing internal structure of  
services and products, can only connect within a single  
Row or layer of abstraction.  
•  
Flow relations between services can only connect  
within a single Row or layer of abstraction.  
•  
Realization relations, from abstract to concrete, can  
only connect between Rows or layers of abstraction.  
Again, that’s it.  
Because the notation is so simple, it allows the true complexity in  
the context to emerge and surface cleanly through the modeling process.  
We don’t get distracted by arbitrary content-based layering\: it’s just the  
enterprise, as enterprise.  
For many modeling purposes, the only relation type we will need is the  
flow relation. Figure C-19 shows a simple example of the flows, products,  
and services in a basic supply chain that allows switching between  
multiple suppliers.  
314 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-19. Multiple-supplier supply-chain relation  
Figure C-20 shows the flows, products, and services in a business  
model with multiple client segments, where we use Product entities  
to record the different transactions and transaction content for each  
client group.  
Figure C-20. Multiple-client supply-chain relation  
315 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
We can use decomposition, modeled via composition relations, to drill  
down into more details about structure. The simplicity of the notation  
means that, as shown in Figure C-21, we are able to model trade-offs  
between implementation options without being forced to place IT-based,  
machine-based, and manual service implementations into different layers.  
Figure C-21. Multi-implementation relationships  
For many types of modeling, we would not need to use realization  
relations at all. The only common contexts where we would need to use  
them are  
•  
•  
Mapping “logical-to-physical” transforms and similar  
transitions between abstract and concrete.  
Mapping dependencies of “why” and/or “how” between  
the layers, such as to show how a specific service  
contributes to the overall aims of the shared enterprise.  
316 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Keeping the notation simple in this way makes modeling faster, makes  
models easier to read, and helps create better understanding of how the  
enterprise actually works.  
#  Comparing Notations for Enterprise Canvas  
There are three notations for Enterprise Canvas\: sketch diagram, formal  
diagram, and toolset-based modeling. They all share the same underlying  
principles, such as the enterprise as a shared story, and “everything is a  
service,” and the same underlying concepts, such as Service, Product, and  
flow, composition, and realization relations; but they each express those  
principles and concepts in their own way, and each has their own distinct  
roles. Understanding the differences and trade-offs between the notations  
will make it easier to gain the best use from Enterprise Canvas in any given  
context for service design. We can illustrate this by showing the same  
“kitchen-sink” model as presented in each notation.  
The sketch notation, as shown in Figure C-22, is probably best used for  
quick, fast-moving whiteboard sessions and live collaborations. By intent,  
there is no formal rigor, but there is just enough structure to keep the  
modeling worthwhile and meaningful. Lines and elements can be erased  
and redrawn with ease, items and annotations added and withdrawn, all at  
breakneck speed, and captured in an instant in photographs or videos, for  
re-use elsewhere, or used as the basis for a more formal model later on.  
317 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-22. Enterprise Canvas “kitchen sink” in hand-sketch format  
The formal notation, as shown in Figure C-23, is probably best  
suited for presentations, conferences, slidedecks, and training materials.  
It is not as fast-moving as the sketch notation, and it does not support  
the automatable formal rigor of the toolset-compatible notation; but  
it is compact and complete, reasonably easy to produce with common  
office-diagramming tools, and does provide the right balance for most  
people’s needs.  
318 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-23. Enterprise Canvas “kitchen sink” in formal notation  
The toolset-compatible notation, as shown in Figure C-24, is probably  
best used when the ideas developed in the sketch notation and formal  
notation need to be moved forward toward real-world implementation.  
It is more cumbersome than the other notations, and usually slower  
to produce, but it does support completeness checks and automated  
validation and is directly compatible with other existing notations for  
service design.  
319 Appendix C Enterprise Canvas Notation  
Figure C-24. Enterprise Canvas “kitchen sink” in toolset notation  
The key point, perhaps, is that all these options are there, and  
available. Switch between notations in whatever way you want, to match  
the business need.  
320  APPENDIX D  
# Enterprise Canvas  
# and Service Viability  
This appendix brings together core concepts and “Into Action” checklists  
from the main part of the book into a single unified set, to show how to  
use Enterprise Canvas as a visual checklist to verify completeness and  
viability of services, in any context within the enterprise.  
“Completeness” means that we check that the service has all the  
connections, support, and flows that it needs, to play its full part in its  
respective role for the enterprise value network.  
“Viability” here is in the sense described in the Viable System Model  
that the interdependencies that the service needs, both to operate in the  
“now” and to change appropriately over time, are all in place and in action.  
In a service-oriented architecture and service-oriented view of  
enterprise, everything either is, implies, or represents a service. This means  
that, to ensure completeness and viability, everything in the enterprise  
will rely on those interlinks and interdependencies between services. As  
seen in previous chapters, Enterprise Canvas explicitly sets out to model  
those interdependencies, and hence can be very useful as a means to help  
identify and verify the required completeness.

#  Preparation  
For this exercise we will need the overview model of service relationships,  
as described in the Enterprise Canvas toolset-compatible notation in  
Appendix C, and as shown in Figure D-1.  
Figure D-1. Simplified notation\: complete Enterprise Canvas  
We will also need the Service-Layers map of layers of abstraction, as  
described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,” and as shown in Figure D-2.  
322 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Figure D-2. Service-Layers model – Enterprise Canvas\: rows  
We will need the Service-Content model – the “service-content map,”  
as described in Chapter 13, “Service Content,” and as shown in Figure D-3.

Service-Content model – Enterprise Canvas\:  
323 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
To model the flows and Product entities moving or bridging between  
services, we will also need to check against the Service-Cycle \(Market-  
Cycle\) model, as described in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” and as shown in  
Figure D-4, with its emphasis on completions for the different parts of each  
interaction and exchange.  
Figure D-4. Service-Cycle model \(service cycle\)  
If we want to start from a business model developed on Business-  
Model Canvas, we will need to first do a cross-map from Business-Model  
Canvas to Enterprise Canvas, as described in “Appendix B\: Working with  
Business Model Canvas.”  
To build the model, use either a purpose-built toolset for enterprise  
architecture or service design, or an office diagramming tool such as Visio,  
Omnigraffle, or Dia, or else draw the model by hand on paper or on a  
whiteboard.  
324 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
#  Notes on Process, Layering, and Story  
That discipline about layering described in Chapter 5, “Service Layers,”  
and “Appendix C\: Enterprise Canvas Notation” becomes particularly  
important when using the checklists here, because our aim is to identify  
and explore direct interdependencies between services.  
Every flow relation between services implies an exchange of some  
kind, even if the exchange consists only of an acknowledgment that a  
relationship exists – which we would typically document in the model as a  
relational asset within a Product entity. To understand interdependence,  
we need to identify the content of those exchanges. Hence, this type of  
modeling demands a discipline about layering that may take some getting  
used to, but is extremely valuable in practice\:  
•  
In general, flow relations and Product entities should  
only connect between Service entities at the same layer.  
•  
Changes in layer should be indicated by realization  
relations between Service entities and/or between  
Product entities.  
•  
Where a flow relation must connect directly between  
Service entities at different layers – such as where  
the actual service for the end-point of that flow is  
currently unknown – the “different-layer” Service  
must be indicated explicitly by a dotted-line border, as  
described in the section on “Modeling Implicit Layer  
Transitions in “Containment” Views” in “Appendix C\:  
Enterprise Canvas Notation.”  
Most modeling for this viability-checklist process would or should  
be at a single layer of abstraction – most often Row-3 “Service Model” or  
Row-4 “Design Model,” as described here. For the supply-chain part of  
the model, this should be straightforward\: any changes in layering should  
325 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
usually be self-evident there. However, it can be all too easy to scramble  
the layering when exploring links with guidance services or with investors  
and beneficiaries.  
For example, if we are using this checklist to focus on a detail-layer  
web service, there may be a strong temptation to tick off the Direct\:\:Change  
guidance service as “IT Strategy” or the like, and then leave it at that. Yet  
doing that could be a real missed opportunity\: “IT Strategy” is abstract, yet  
there is real work there that is done by real people, every bit as real as the  
web service that is our current focus of attention. Hence, it might be useful  
to ask about what exactly is the chain of responsibilities and connections,  
and hence flow relations and Products connecting real-world Services,  
that links between that people-based work and this web service. There  
are some valuable insights to be gained there about how the enterprise  
actually works, and how it maintains its viability\: it is well worth the extra  
effort around layer discipline in order to obtain them.  
Another useful discipline to apply while using this checklist relates  
to story.  
So far most of what we have explored in this book has been focused on  
structure and relationships between structures\: services, products, flows,  
composition, and realization. However, another equally valid way to look  
at architecture and service design is to explore it in terms of story.  
One of the first things we say with Enterprise Canvas is that everything  
is a service; yet it is equally true to say that everything is a story. Every  
service is a story, represents a story, has its own story to tell. Every  
exchange is a story. Every product is a story. Every flow or composition or  
realization is a story. Every change is a story. The enterprise itself is a story,  
too. Everything is, represents, or implies a story.  
An architecture or a service design is all about structure, and dynamics  
of structure; yet it is also all about stories. Stories engage; stories draw  
people in; stories give people a reason to be involved in whatever it is  
that the service does and delivers, and how and why and where and with  
what it does so. It is often in the stories that people tell us that we find the  
326 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
most important clues about what is working or not-working within the  
enterprise, and what to do to make it work better. In that sense, the stories  
definitely do matter.  
Whenever we look at an architecture or service design, and whenever  
we look at its structure, we need also to look at, and look for, the stories  
that underlie and underpin and interweave with that structure. And  
likewise, whenever we look at the stories, we need to look for the  
underlying structures that they each imply. Architecture is both structure  
and story.  
In that sense, it is useful to see Enterprise Canvas not just as a  
framework for models of structure, but also as an anchor for stories,  
about the enterprise, about how everything fits together, or not, within  
the unified whole that is the organization and its broader enterprise. We  
need to keep this theme in mind as we work through the viability-checklist  
process for a service.  
#  Start with the Service Itself  
To get started with the checklist, pick a service – any service, anywhere in  
the overall enterprise – that happens to be of interest at present. If none  
comes immediately to mind, start with the organization as a whole, as a  
service in context of its market and the broader shared enterprise.  
Place a Service entity in the middle of the model, to represent the  
chosen “service-in-focus,” as shown in Figure D-5. Then follow the  
instructions below, to see what insights arise as the modeling proceeds.  
Figure D-5. Service  
327 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
What is this service? We start by assigning it a name. If we’re doing the  
modeling within a toolset for enterprise architecture or service design, we  
should also provide a brief description of the service and its role.  
What layer of abstraction will we use as the base for modeling this  
service? This should be one of the following\:  
•  
Row-2 “Business Model,” to describe the overall  
context, without much if any description of actual  
content.  
•  
Row-3 “Service Model,” the implementation-  
independent “logical” layer, where we start to fill in the  
details of the content of services and the inter-service  
exchanges.  
•  
Row-4 “Design Model,” the implementation-specific  
“physical” layer.  
•  
Row-5 “Deployment Model,” the fine detail intended  
for use at run time.  
Remember that, as described in Chapter 13, “Service Content,” if any  
specific technology or implementation is mentioned, then by definition  
the description is at Row-4 or below.  
Apply a RACI assessment to the service\:  
•  
Who is ultimately responsible or accountable for this  
service?  
•  
Who assists in delivering or running or supporting this  
service?  
•  
Who needs to be consulted about this service, or any  
changes to this service?  
•  
Who needs to be informed about the performance of or  
changes to this service?  
328 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
What other responsibilities and accountabilities apply in this context?  
#  The Core Activities of the Service  
As a first step in the functional decomposition of the service – about what  
it does, and how, and why, as described in Chapter 7, “Service Roles and  
Relationships” – we should focus attention on the three innermost cells of  
the Enterprise Canvas view of the service, as shown in Figure D-6.  
Figure D-6. Service\: core  
What value does this service provide – its Value Proposition, in terms  
of the aims and needs and values of the broader extended enterprise? If  
appropriate, build a trail of linkage up through the layers of abstraction, to  
connect with the vision and values of the shared enterprise. To model this,  
link this service to at least one other matching Service or Element entity  
in each layer upward to Row-1; then link to one or more Value entities in  
Row-0, and ultimately to the Vision entity at that top of the abstraction  
“tree.” We will come back to some of this later when we explore this  
service’s links to its Validation services.  
329 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
What does this service do to create and deliver that value – its Value  
Creation in terms of that Value Proposition? Use the Service-Content  
model, as described in Chapter 13, “Service Content,” to explore and  
identify the various assets, functions, locations, capabilities, events, and  
decisions that apply within that value creation. We will come back to  
some of this later when we explore this service’s links to its Coordination  
services.  
What does this service need to govern its service delivery – its Value  
Governance to keep the Value Creation on track to the Value Proposition?  
How does it do this? Under what business rules? We will come back to  
some of this later when we explore this service’s links to its Direct and  
Validate services.  
Apply a RACI assessment to each of these subsidiary “cells” within the  
service\: who is responsible or accountable, for what, and why?  
#  Service Provision  
For the next step, as shown in Figure D-7, we explore what this service  
provides to others, and also explore who those “others” might be. The  
connections between services will be as described in Chapter 9, “Service  
Flows,” particularly the section on the Service Cycle.  
330 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Figure D-7. Service\: outgoing  
What does this service provide to others – the services or products  
consumed by others?  
Using the “Assets” column of the Service-Content map as a guide, what  
forms does this service provision take, at each stage of the Service Cycle?  
Model the results of this assessment as one or more Product entities, linked  
via flow relations to the right-hand “outgoing” side of the Service entity.  
Who or what are the customers or consumers of these services? For  
each distinct customer group, there should be a distinct Service Cycle,  
usually with at least one distinct Product for each stage of that cycle. If  
necessary, split the overall exchange content into further Product entities,  
each linked to a Service entity for each respective customer group.  
Review each Product in terms of what aspects of the overall exchange  
and its content take place before, during, and after each main transaction.  
Use the Service-Cycle model to map these as follows\:  
•  
What reputation, trust, relations, and attention need  
to be in place before each main transaction? What  
Customer-Relations subsidiary services exist within the  
331 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
service to support the interactions that would enable  
these to be created and maintained? In Service-Cycle  
terms, what completions are needed to ensure that  
these are maintained as required, especially over the  
longer term?  
•  
What are the core transactions in the service delivery,  
and what happens during those transactions? Via  
what Customer Channels or other means are the  
services delivered? What protocols are needed to set  
up each transaction itself? In Service-Cycle terms,  
what completions are needed to mark the end of the  
transaction, and ensure that the transaction itself is  
closed-off and complete?  
•  
What follow-up interactions need to occur after the  
main transaction – such as payment and the like?  
What Value-Return subsidiary services exist within the  
service to support these interactions? In Service-Cycle  
terms, what completions are needed to ensure that  
everything is complete and all parties are satisfied by or  
from the transaction?  
Define subsidiary Product entities as required for each of these before,  
during, and after flows, and link these via flow relations to the respective  
subsidiary cells of the service.  
Optionally, use the Service-Content map to summarize the assets,  
activities, and other content for each of the subsidiary services and for the  
products within each of the subsidiary flows.  
Apply a RACI assessment to each of these “customer-side” subsidiary  
services within the service, to identify responsibilities and accountabilities  
for each aspect of the Product transactions and relations with the  
respective “customer” service.

Given that the before, during, and after interactions may all occur at  
different times, through different channels and on different timescales,  
what mechanisms exist within the service to keep them all in balance, and  
appropriately linked to the core Value Proposition, Value Creation, and  
Value Governance of the service? Who or what is responsible for enacting  
and governing each of these internal activities and interactions?  
#  Consuming Other Services  
Next, as shown in Figure D-8, we explore the “incoming” side of the  
service – the services and products provided by and/or consumed from  
others – and identify who those “others” might be. As in the preceding  
“Service Provision” section, the connections between services will be as  
described in Chapter 9, “Service Flows,” particularly the section on the  
Service Cycle.  
Figure D-8. Service\: incoming  
333 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
This is the symmetric opposite of service provision, and hence we  
should assess and model it in exactly the same way. The “others” in this  
case are usually described as suppliers or partners.  
What does this service consume from others – the services or products  
provided by others? What forms does this service provision take? What  
values, policies, events, content, and trust apply in each service provision  
to this service? Model the results of this assessment as one or more Product  
entities, linked to the left-hand or “incoming” side of the Service entity.  
Who or what are the suppliers or partners for each of these services?  
For each distinct supplier group, there should usually be at least one  
distinct Product; if necessary, split the overall exchange content into  
further Product entities, each linked to a Service entity for each respective  
supplier group.  
Review each Product in terms of what aspects of the overall exchange  
and its content take place before, during, and after each main transaction.  
Use the Service-Cycle model to map these as follows\:  
•  
What reputation, trust, relations, and attention need  
to be in place before each main transaction? What  
Supplier-Relations subsidiary services exist within the  
service to support these? What completions are needed  
to ensure that these are maintained as required?  
•  
What are the core transactions in the service delivery,  
and what happens during those transactions? Via what  
Supplier Channels or other means are the services  
delivered? What protocols are needed to set up each  
transaction itself? What completions are needed to  
mark the end of the transaction, and ensure that the  
transaction itself is closed-off and complete?  
334 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
•  
What follow-up interactions need to occur after the  
main transaction – such as payment and the like?  
What Value-Outlay subsidiary services exist within  
the service to support these interactions? What  
completions are needed to ensure that everything is  
complete and all parties are satisfied?  
Define subsidiary Product entities as required for each of these before,  
during, and after flows, and link these to the respective subsidiary cells of  
the service.  
Optionally, use the Service-Content map to summarize the assets,  
activities, and other content for each of the subsidiary services.  
Apply a RACI assessment to each of these “customer-side” subsidiary  
services within the service, to identify responsibilities and accountabilities  
for each aspect of the Product transactions and relations with the  
respective “customer” service.  
What mechanisms exist within the service to keep all of the before,  
during, and after interactions in balance, and appropriately linked to  
the core Value Proposition, Value Creation, and Value Governance of the  
service? Who or what is responsible for enacting and governing each of  
these internal activities and interactions?  
Who or what is responsible for the overall balance across the whole  
of the service? \(In principle this is a key part of the role of the Value-  
Governance subsidiary services, but may in part be enacted by others\: if so,  
who or what are they, and what mechanisms exist to ensure balance?\)  
#  Guidance Service Relationships  
As described in Chapter 10, “Service Guidance,” the concept of “guidance  
services” is adapted from the Viable System Model, with some extensions.  
These represent the web of service interdependencies that ensure both the  
335 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
governance and viability of the service – the effectiveness of its operations  
at run time, and its adaptability and resilience to change, especially over  
the longer term. These are described under three categories as follows\:  
•  
Direction\: Services that assist in strategy, planning, and  
day-to-day operations of this service and its clusters of  
related services.  
•  
Coordination\: Services that assist in run-time  
coordination with other services, and with planning  
and coordination of change.  
•  
Validation\: Services that help to keep the service on-  
track with and aligned to the vision, values, and success  
criteria of the shared enterprise.  
These services or functions may be embedded somewhere within the  
service itself, though also often enacted by separate business functions  
connected in some way to this service. In a few cases, especially for some  
aspects of validation services, they may be required by law to be enacted  
by a completely separate organization. Yet in whatever form they may be  
implemented in real-world practice, the point is that they must all exist  
somewhere, in some form, in an engaged relationship with this specific  
service, in order to ensure viability of the system as a whole.  
#  Guidance\: Direction  
The direction services represent the usual “management”-type functions  
of the enterprise, seen here in relation to the service that is our current  
focus of attention.  
Note that, for our purposes here, these “management functions” are  
viewed here solely as services in relation to other services, with no  
special priority or importance over anything else. Although business  
336 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
politics may argue otherwise elsewhere, within whole-of-system  
service design itself, we must view “the management” as just  
another support service, nothing more nor less than that.  
As shown in Figure D-9, these direction services can be split into three  
distinct groups, often referred to as “Develop the Business,” “Change the  
Business,” and “Run the Business.”  
Figure D-9. Service\: direction  
In classic concepts of management, “Develop” and “Change” are  
primarily viewed as staff functions, whereas “Run” is primarily viewed  
as a line-management function. There is also a timescale element here\:  
“Develop” tends to have a long time-view, ranging from years to decades,  
potentially all the way to infinity; “Change” has a medium-term view, from  
the current quarter out to a few years ahead at most; while “Run” is mostly  
focused on the day-to-day. Strategy develops out of the intersection between  
“Develop” and “Change”; tactics from the intersection of “Change” and  
“Run”; and operations from the intersection between “Run” and this service.  
337 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Most of these services must not and cannot be outsourced to another  
organization.  
Questions to ask here include  
•  
•  
•  
Direct\:\:Develop – What support for long-term direction  
does this service need? What services would ensure  
that this service is aligned to the overall Vision for  
the enterprise? By what means are these “Develop”  
direction services delivered to this service? Who or  
what is responsible for providing these services to  
the organization in general, and to this service in  
particular?  
Direct\:\:Change – What support for medium-term  
strategic direction does this service need? What  
services would ensure that this service is aligned to the  
changing context of its market and business ecosystem?  
By what means are these “Change” direction services  
delivered to this service? Who or what is responsible for  
providing these services to the organization in general,  
and to this service in particular?  
Direct\:\:Run – What support for day-to-day  
management does this service need? What services  
would ensure that this service has the resources  
that it needs to do its work in creating value? What  
performance metrics does this service need to provide  
to those “Run” direction functions? How are those  
performance metrics used in providing management  
services to this service? By what means are these “Run”  
direction services delivered to this service? Who or  
what is responsible for these services, and how they  
apply to this service?  
338 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Identify the services and exchanges in each case, typically using the  
Service-Content map to assess the content of activities of each service.  
Add the results of this assessment to the model as Service entities and  
Product entities, linked to the service-in-focus via flow relations. Use either  
containment \(as in the previous diagram\) or composition relations to link  
each of these Service entities to the overall Direction Service. Annotate  
each flow relation here with a “direct” label, to indicate that the flow  
delivers direction services to the service-in-focus.  
“Develop the Business” is ultimately a role and responsibility that  
belongs *solely* to the executive team, on behalf of the organization as  
a whole in relation to its shared enterprise. Architects and others may  
provide *decision support* for that role, but *not* the *decision-making*\:  
that distinction is extremely important in practice!  
Even so, we do still need to address these issues in the viability  
checklist, because in some organizations, the distinct tasks of  
“Develop the Business” may instead be subsumed into “Change  
the Business” or even “Run the Business.” That type of imbalance  
between the direction services can become a cause of architecturally  
inadequate support to the organization’s overall services and inability  
to develop and maintain any real strategy, and in turn may lead  
to organizational failure over the medium to longer term\: *it is an*  
*extremely important architectural risk for the organization*, and for the  
enterprise as a whole. In short, if adequate and appropriate direction  
support is not available, the service will *not* be viable\: a key purpose  
for this part of the checklist is to advise the executive and others of  
any potential for that type of risk.  
339 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
#  Guidance\: Coordination  
The coordination services represent the business functions that coordinate  
this service with other services.  
As shown in Figure D-10, these services can be split into three distinct  
groups, often referred to as “Develop the Business,” “Change the Business,”  
and “Run the Business,” in parallel with the matching functions in the  
Direction services.  
Figure D-10. Service\: coordination  
In classic concepts of management, these services are usually regarded  
as part of the “management” functions. In practice they will often need  
to be separate and distinct, not least because in many cases they must  
somehow bridge between management-hierarchy silos. Significant  
organizational problems can arise from that one fact.  
The Coordinate\:\:Develop services relate to coordination of strategy  
and strategic change, and hence will link to both Direct\:\:Develop and  
340 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Direct\:\:Change. It is also often associated with portfolio management and  
the like.  
The Coordinate\:\:Change services focus more at the tactical level,  
and hence link to Direct\:\:Change and Direct\:\:Run. One classic role  
for these services is in project management and the Programme  
Management Office.  
The Coordinate\:\:Run services would bridge between Direct\:\:Run and  
the actual delivery services.  
In practice, though, that kind of bridge may risk being interpreted as  
“insubordination,” and hence at the human-coordination level may  
disappear into a kind of covert “shadow network” via which work is  
*actually* coordinated and done.  
Service designers can sometimes run up against unexpected  
“political” problems of that kind when doing this part of the modeling  
work\: a certain amount of caution may be advisable here!  
It is quite common for some aspects of these services to be outsourced  
to other organizations. If so, additional coordination services would be  
required, to manage and coordinate the outsourcing process itself.  
Questions to ask here include  
•  
Coordinate\:\:Develop – What support for long-term  
strategic change does this service need? What services  
would ensure that this service is aligned to the overall  
enterprise strategy? By what means are these “Develop”  
coordination services delivered to this service? Who  
or what is responsible for providing these services  
to the organization in general, and to this service in  
particular?  
341 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
•  
•  
Coordinate\:\:Change – What support for medium-  
term tactical change does this service need? What  
services would ensure that this service is aligned to  
and fully supports the changing context of its market  
and business ecosystem? By what means – such as  
program- or project-management – are these “Change”  
coordination services delivered to this service? Who  
or what is responsible for providing these services  
to the organization in general, and to this service in  
particular?  
Coordinate\:\:Run – What support does this service need  
for run-time coordination with other services, and for  
load-balancing with its sibling services? What services  
would ensure that this service has the coordination  
with others that it needs so as to do its work in creating  
value? What information flows, signaling, or protocols  
are needed in this coordination support? By what  
means are these “Run” coordination services delivered  
to this service? Who or what is responsible for these  
services, and how they apply to this service?  
As before, identify the services and exchanges in each case. Add these  
to the model as Service entities and Product entities, linked to the service-  
in-focus via flow relations. Use either containment or composition relations  
to link each of these Service entities to the overall Coordination Service.  
Annotate each flow relation here with a “coordinate” label, to indicate that  
the flow delivers coordination services to the service-in-focus.  
Identifying coordination relationships between services will usually  
be straightforward, although it can be all too easy to fall into layering  
mistakes in the modeling process here. A lot of useful insights can be  
342 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
gained here about the interconnectedness of the enterprise, and its  
dynamics over time. Note, though, that there are also some important  
architectural risks and opportunities to be identified here\: in short, if  
adequate and appropriate *coordination* support is not available, the  
service will *not* be viable.  
#  Guidance\: Validation  
The validation services help to enact governance and to keep everything  
aligned to the enterprise vision and values, whatever those values may  
be. Note that there should usually be distinct sets of validation services  
for each key value of concern in the enterprise. Typical examples of values  
in this context would include quality, probity, security, ethics, health and  
safety, knowledge-sharing, sustainability, waste management, efficiency,  
effectiveness, and also architecture and service design itself.  
A crucial point here is that, unlike strategy, management, coordination,  
or change, maintaining these values is a personal responsibility for  
everyone in the enterprise. There is often a small core group tasked with  
“holding the flag” for the respective value within the organization, and  
it’s those people – the knowledge-management team, the quality team,  
the security team, and so on – who we would often regard as the people  
who deliver such services. In reality, though, it’s only the support services  
around each value that most of those teams would deliver\: the actual  
implementation and expression of that value must somehow be embedded  
and enacted, as activities and checks and the like, within every service in  
the enterprise.  
343 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
As shown in Figure D-11, these support services for value alignment  
would be split into three groups\: “Develop Awareness” of the value;  
“Develop Capability” to enact run-time support for the value; and “Verify  
and Audit,” to confirm alignment and compliance to the requirements of  
the value.  
Figure D-11. Service\: validation  
In classic concepts of management, these services are often  
subsumed into the “management” functions, which can often lead  
to misunderstandings because the managers themselves must be  
as subject to the values as is everyone else. It is true, though, that in  
many cases the core support group for each value will be regarded  
as a “staff” function, often reporting indirectly or even directly to the  
Ceo or overall executive; it’s certainly essential for each of these  
values to have the full backing of the executive, otherwise in practice  
they end up going nowhere.  
344 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Although these validation services do provide guidance across the  
enterprise, they are in effect almost orthogonal to the direction services such  
as management, and to coordination services such as change management.  
Some aspects of these services may be outsourced to other organizations,  
such as training to develop capability, and in many contexts the “Verify and  
Audit” functions must be enacted by an outside organization, either to support  
certification or as mandated by law. Overall, though, the final responsibility for  
alignment to each of the enterprise values must reside within the organization  
itself\: that aspect of these services cannot be outsourced.  
In effect, these services should represent the nodes of a PDCA \(Plan/  
Do/Check/Act\) continuous-improvement loop for the respective value,  
starting at the “Act” node.  
•  
Plan\: “Develop Capability” is crucial to embedding the  
ability to enact support for the value.  
•  
Do\: The awareness and capability are applied in  
practice within each service and service delivery.  
•  
Check\: “Verify and Audit” confirms compliance, or any  
deviation from required or intended performance.  
•  
Act\: “Develop Awareness” is central to taking action  
toward improving support for the value.  
Before any of this modeling work can make sense, there are some  
essential questions that need to be asked, as described in Chapter 4,  
“Service Vision and Values”\:  
•  
What are the enterprise values? Why do these values  
apply in this enterprise, and in this organization?  
•  
Which of these values are explicitly espoused as matter  
of personal choice, by the executive and/or by others?  
Which of these values are imposed on the organization  
from outside, as part of a metaphoric “license to  
operate” within the industry or broader social milieu?  
345 Appendix D   
Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
•  
What differences – if any – exist between the espoused  
values and the values actually enacted and upheld  
within the organization and/or the broader shared  
enterprise?  
As described in “Appendix C\: Enterprise Canvas Notation,” these  
values should typically be modeled as Value entities in a Row-0 segment  
of an Enterprise Canvas, attached to the Vision entity in the model. Within  
the model, Service entities for all validation services should ultimately link  
back via realization relations to one or more Row-0 Value entities.  
Given that list of enterprise values, questions to ask here for each  
enterprise value include\:  
•  
Validate\:\:Awareness\: What support does this service  
need to develop and establish awareness of the value  
and its importance to the organization and enterprise?  
What services would ensure that this service is aligned  
to the respective value? By what means are these  
“Develop Awareness” validation services for this value  
delivered to this service? Who or what is responsible for  
providing these services to the organization in general,  
and to this service in particular?  
•  
Validate\:\:Capability\: What support does this service  
need to develop and improve its capability to enact  
the requirements of the value within the service and  
its service delivery? What services would ensure that  
this capability is appropriately developed, and the  
capability verified prior to action? By what means –  
such as training programs – are these “Develop  
Capability” validation services delivered to this service?  
Who or what is responsible for providing these services  
to the organisation in general, and to this service in  
particular?  
346 •  
•  
Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Run-time support within this service\: What functionality  
and other support exists within this service to enact the  
value within all of its activities and processes? In what  
ways are the awareness of the value and capabilities  
to support the value expressed in practice? Since this  
represents a personal responsibility incumbent on  
everyone involved, what support exists at run time to  
ensure that those responsibilities are upheld?  
Validate\:\:Verify\: What support does this service need  
so as to verify and audit its actual performance in  
relation to the respective value? What services would  
ensure that this service has indeed delivered that  
performance? What records and other sources are  
needed in this validation support? By what means are  
these “Verify and Audit” validation services delivered  
to this service? By what means are these “Verify and  
Audit” services themselves verified and audited for  
alignment to the value? Who or what is responsible for  
these services, and how they apply to this service?  
As before, identify the services and product exchanges in each case.  
Add these to the model as Service entities and Product entities, linked  
to the service-in-focus via flow relations. Use either containment or  
composition relations to link each of these Service entities to the overall  
Validation Service. Annotate each flow relation here with a “validate” label,  
to indicate that the flow delivers validation services to the service-in-focus.  
Again, be careful to avoid falling into layering mistakes in the  
modeling process here. Overall, there are a lot of useful insights  
to be gained here, about the nature of the enterprise, and about  
architectural risks and opportunities. The key concern to note, as  
347 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
with the other guidance services, is that the service-in-focus will  
not be viable – especially over the longer term – unless adequate  
and appropriate *validation* support is available for *each* value in the  
context.  
#  Investors and Beneficiaries  
As described in Chapter 11, “Service Investors and Beneficiaries,” the  
Investor and Beneficiary services respectively represent those who  
contribute value to the service, or to whom value is returned from the  
service, beyond and outside of the usual transactions of the service’s  
supply chain. The relationships and service roles are as shown in  
Figure D-12.  
Figure D-12. Services\: investors and beneficiaries  
348 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Note that “value” here has a somewhat different meaning to “values”  
in the enterprise-values sense referenced by the validation services\:  
the two terms are closely related, but they’re not the same.  
For our purposes here, “value” is likely to have a much broader  
meaning than money alone\: we may need to track a myriad of  
different forms of value, and the ways they may be transformed  
from one type to another within the service itself. For example, in a  
business-startup context, people may invest time and skill and effort,  
and hope to receive monetary return, whereas in a non-profit context,  
people might invest money in the hope of seeing broader social  
benefit. These same overall principles may apply right down to the  
level of an individual web service or the like.  
Also do be aware that although this is an essential part of the  
viability checklist, it can sometimes be misunderstood as “political”\:  
in commercial organizations in particular, there may be strong  
pressures to either ignore all non-monetary forms of value, or to try  
to force all forms of value into monetary terms. For our purposes  
here, though, we *do* need to model the actual forms of value in each  
context, *in their own terms, prior to any potential conversion to any*  
*other form such as money*. Failing to do so will invariably lead to  
architectural problems that can have serious impacts on overall  
viability – particularly via anti-clients and other kurtosis risks.  
349 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Questions to ask here include  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Investor\: Who or what invests value in this service, in  
order to get it started, or to keep it running? What forms  
of value are delivered as investment in this service? Via  
what services, relationships, and exchanges are these  
investments delivered to this service?  
Beneficiary\: Who or what receives value as a return  
from this service? What forms of value delivered by  
this service as returns to its beneficiaries? Via what  
services, relationships, and exchanges are these returns  
delivered by this service?  
Transformation\: What are the differences, if any,  
between the forms of value that are invested, and the  
forms of value that are returned as benefits? By what  
means do these value transforms take place within this  
service?  
Balance\: In what ways and to what extent are the invest  
and benefit relationships in balance, both before and  
after transformations of value within this service?  
What relationships with other services are needed  
to monitor that balance, and/or to take action to  
correct any perceived imbalance? If the two flows do  
not balance overall, what impact would this have on  
overall viability, both of this service and of other related  
services?  
As usual, identify the services and product exchanges in each case.  
Add these to the model as Service entities and Product entities, linked to  
the service-in-focus via flow relations. If necessary, use either containment  
or composition relations to link each of these Service entities to the overall  
Investor or Beneficiary Service.  
350 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Annotate each flow relation here with an “invest” or “benefit” label,  
to indicate either that the flow delivers investment of some form to the  
service-in-focus, or that the service delivers benefits to a beneficiary. An  
“invest” flow will typically connect either to the Service as a whole, or to the  
Value-Outlay cell, since the latter represents an abstraction of the activities  
that manage costs and outgoing payments and the like. For much the same  
reasons, a “benefit” flow would typically connect either to the Service as a  
whole, or to its Value-Return cell.  
Once again, do take care to avoid falling into layering mistakes. There  
are some very important and often enlightening insights to be gained  
here, again about the nature of the overall enterprise, and about  
architectural risks and opportunities. The key concern to note is that  
the service-in-focus may not be or remain viable unless it does have  
adequate and appropriate investor support, and that, in architectural  
terms, at least, the balance between investors and beneficiaries is  
appropriately managed.  
#  Iteration and Recursion  
At this point we would have completed the viability checklist for that  
single service-in-focus – the Service entity with which we started. We could  
now apply the same checklist assessment, recursively and iteratively, to  
any of the Service entities that we have added to the model during this  
process\: everything is, represents, or implies a service, so the same viability  
principles apply everywhere and at every level.  
351 Appendix D Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
For obvious reasons, don’t attempt to apply this to *everything*\: by  
definition, it would take an infinite amount of time to complete the  
model! Instead, it’s wise to hold to the guideline that we *only* create  
a model in response to an explicit business question, and *only* to the  
level of detail needed to answer or respond to that question.  
In the same way, it can often be useful to do a drill-down into the  
details of a specific service, and apply the same viability assessment at  
the next level down; or to the next level upward, to a more abstract layer  
at which redesign and restructure becomes possible. \(Or levels – again,  
iteration and recursion would apply in both directions all the way up and  
down the layers of abstraction.\)  
In drill-down or drill-up, we do need to be especially careful about  
the distinctions between layers of granularity and layers of abstraction,  
because it’s very easy to get them confused here. Going up or down  
in granularity – composition relations – is just a change in detail\: each  
“child” – or “parent” – service will handle a subset or superset of the  
service content and Product content of the initial service-in-focus.  
However, going up or down in abstraction – realization relations – involves  
a change in the type of detail that can be described\: for example, Row-3  
cannot contain descriptions of any specific technology or implementation  
method, whereas Row-4 can.  
Beyond that, though, there are no real restrictions on what we can  
model in Enterprise Canvas, or why\: we are welcome to iterate or recurse  
to our hearts’ content, up and down the layers, and anywhere across the  
enterprise context.

Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Joseph Chittenden \(UK\) worked with me on design  
and more in our development of the Change-  
Mapping methods, built around Five Elements and  
Enterprise Canvas.  
Nate Gerber \(Canada\) tested live applications of  
Enterprise Canvas and related tools and methods for  
business needs in logistics, local government, social  
service, arts and theatre, and more.  
Milan Guenther \(France\), Annika Klyver \(Sweden\), and  
others at the Intersection Group applied Enterprise  
Canvas concepts and related methods to industrial  
design and system design.  
Cynthia Kurtz \(USA\) provided the core distinction  
between “order” and “unorder” in the sensemaking  
aspects of Enterprise Canvas.  
Helen Mills and Peter Tseglakof \(Australia\) brought  
me into the world of logistics and whole-enterprise  
architectures beyond IT, which then provided key parts  
of the practical basis for Enterprise Canvas.  
Bard Papegaaij \(Netherlands\) worked with me on  
linking soft-systems methods and human factors into  
Enterprise Canvas, and also on development of training  
courses for applications of Enterprise Canvas and  
related tools and methods.  
Jose Ramos \(Australia\) and others on the Strategic  
Foresight course at Swinburne University in Melbourne  
introduced me to the futures methods that underlie key  
aspects of Enterprise Canvas and its related tools.

Appendix E Enterprise Canvas and Service ViABility  
Helena Read \(Australia\) adapted Enterprise Canvas  
and other methods for use in environmental teaching  
materials and courses for schoolchildren in Australia,  
China, and other countries.  
Michael Smith Castillo \(Mexico\) was one of the key  
collaborators in the early developments for Enterprise  
Canvas, also working with me on business applications  
for the Five Elements model and the “holomap”  
service-context model, and in testing the work  
with clients across several industries in Mexico and  
Guatemala, upon which we built the fictional ZapaMex  
test case used throughout this book.  
Also my team at Wordsmiths, back in the late 1970s  
to mid-1980s in southwest England, as we built one  
of the world’s first microcomputer-based typesetting  
businesses that provided a key precursor for desktop  
publishing and gave me the first-hand experiences  
upon which much of my later work on whole-  
enterprise architectures has been based.  
There have been many other collaborators over the years, some of  
whom I cannot name for reasons of confidentiality and client security, who  
have worked with me on a diverse range of projects across many different  
industries around the world. I thank them all.

If you’re familiar with enterprise architecture or related fields, you will no  
doubt have recognized a few familiar frames among the various aspects of  
the Enterprise Canvas – if perhaps in somewhat unfamiliar form at times.  
Yet this should be no surprise, because a lot of effort has been made to  
ensure that the Canvas is compatible with other commonly used model  
types, to simplify translation to and from those models – such as in the  
example for Business-Model Canvas, as described in Appendix B.  
The core idea that “everything is a service” is drawn from my book The  
Service Oriented Enterprise, which in turn draws on principles adapted in  
part from Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model \(of which more later\).

Architecture and Viable Services \(Apress, 2023\)  
The concept of vision as an unchanging “guiding star,” and the  
consistent structure for the bridge between that abstract vision and  
concrete everyday activities, is drawn in part from the ISO–9000\:2000  
international standard on quality systems.

The nine-cell structure for the core of the Enterprise Canvas is inspired  
in part by the Business Model Canvas, developed by Alex Osterwalder and  
described in the book Business Model Generation.

The Market Model was in part derived, though much-extended, from  
the assertion in the Cluetrain Manifesto that “markets are conversations.”  
The remainder of the model comes from own work on the tetradian  
dimensions, as described in my book Doing Enterprise Architecture.

The layers for the Enterprise Canvas were adapted and extended  
from the Zachman Framework. Zachman uses five distinct rows or  
layers of abstraction to describe to sequence of change from future to  
present; I added one more layer above, and another below, to represent  
the unchanging future of the vision, and the unchangeable past of actual  
metrics and records.

The set of interrogatives – What, How, Where, Who, When, Why – used  
to identify lists of entities for Row-1 of the Enterprise Canvas was inspired  
in part from their usage in the Zachman Framework.  
•  
Zachman Framework\: as above  
The matrix checklist used to in the Service-Content model to identify  
internal content for services and products is based in part on a much-  
amended version of the Zachman Framework, and also in part on my own  
work on the tetradian dimensions, as described in my book Bridging the Silos.

The method for assessing nodes in the Five Elements cycle within  
services was adapted in part from the VPEC-T \(values, policies, events,  
content, trust\) framework, developed by Nigel Green.

The guidance services for the Enterprise Canvas are adapted and  
extended from elements of Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model \(VSM\),  
as originally described in his book The Brain of the Firm and used in  
the groundbreaking Cybersyn system in Chile in 1972. In VSM, the core  
service \(“delivery service”\) is referred to as System-1, the coordination  
services as System-2, and the direction services as a collective of three  
distinct sub-services referred to as System–3, System–4, and System–5. The  
original for the generic validation services in the Enterprise Canvas was a  
single function for audit and review in VSM, referred to as System–3\*. The  
extensions to VSM used in the Enterprise Canvas were first described in  
my book The Service-Oriented Enterprise, in which the validation services  
are referred to as “pervasive services.”

The systems principles referenced in various places throughout the  
text are derived and adapted from many different sources, such as Stafford  
Beer’s VSM and Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline. The predictability model  
is derived from an earlier model in my book Inventing Reality. The related  
methods for context-space mapping are derived from and described in my  
book Everyday Enterprise Architecture.

A common underlying theme that surfaces in some aspects of  
Enterprise Canvas, such as the service-flows model, is based on a Five  
Elements frame, adapted in part from Bruce Tuckman’s “Group Dynamics”  
project-lifecycle model, together with the wu xing five-phase model that  
underpins much of traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine. Some  
other present-day business applications of this theme are described in my  
book SEMPER and SCORE.
