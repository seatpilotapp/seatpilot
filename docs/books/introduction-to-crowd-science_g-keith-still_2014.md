269 Introduction  
Experience is one thing you can’t get for nothing.  
Oscar Wilde  
The only source of knowledge is experience.  
Albert Einstein  
We have spent the last two decades developing computer simulations, soft-  
ware systems, tools, techniques and methodologies relating to crowd risk  
analysis and safety engineering. This effort has not been an academic exer-  
cise; the tools have been applied to many of the worlds’ largest and most  
challenging events. These include design aspects of the Jamarat Bridge \(the  
stoning of the devil ritual, part of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca\), the  
2011 Royal Wedding, London New Year events and as expert witness on a  
number of high-profile cases \(Love Parade, Germany\).  
Realising, over a decade ago, that computer simulations were only a small  
part of our consulting projects, we began to focus more of our time towards  
teaching and training programmes. The bulk of our work is now aimed  
at developing better techniques for crowd risk analysis and safety engi-  
neering. We do this through educational material and university courses,  
Foundation degree and BA \(Hons\) courses.  
For over 20 years we have reviewed events, accident and incidents, best  
practices, things that came close to failure, near misses, and we have inte-  
grated that information back into the teaching and training programmes.  
That experience is integral to the materials we are developing in several short  
courses and an MSc \(masters\) course as eLearning systems. These are not  
theoretical courses for academics—these are courses for practitioners. They  
cover real-world, practical techniques and methodologies, grounded and  
aimed towards the operational side of crowd safety. There are two objec-  
tives to these courses\: the first is to raise awareness of crowd risks in built  
and complex environments, and the second is to provide simple pragmatic,  
low-cost and easy-to-apply techniques in order to improve crowd safety.  
xv xvi Introduction  
Making available our experience over a wide spectrum of events is the  
purpose of this book; to pass that knowledge and information to a wider  
audience. We look at the ways in which events can be made to work well,  
how they can—and do—fail, and how they are often dangerously close to  
failure. For over a decade, we have run workshops around the world on  
crowd risk analysis and safety engineering. At the start of the crowd safety  
workshops, we usually ask the delegates this question\:  
Show of hands—how many people in this room have, at the end of an  
event, thought\: Phew! We were lucky that time?  
The day nobody raises a hand will be the time to stop teaching. Preface  
‘Safety First’ is ‘Safety Always’.  
Charles M. Hayes  
The safety of the people shall be the highest law.  
Marcus Tullius Cicero  
In this book, we\* demonstrate how crowd accidents and incidents—specifically  
mass fatalities in crowded spaces—can occur, and how they  
can be avoided using simple, practical and low-cost analysis techniques. We  
explore the underlying causes of accidents and incidents and provide the  
reader with a comprehensive set of tools for crowd risk analysis and crowd  
safety engineering. These tools, methods and worked examples come from  
over two decades of consulting on major crowd projects.  
We have also been teaching, training and developing applications around  
the world for over 10 years; these methods have been applied to many major  
events in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. We demon-  
strate real-world case studies from a range of event sites and illustrate how  
we managed risk in some complex sites.  
Throughout this book, we focus on the practical elements of developing  
the crowd risk analysis and crowd safety aspects of an event plan, with  
consideration to places of public assembly, major events and large-scale  
urban environments. We define a range of modelling techniques, includ-  
ing line diagrams that represent crowd flow, calculations of the speed  
at which a space can fill, and of the time it takes for that space to reach  
critical and then crush density. We define a method of understanding,  
during the event planning and approval \(licensing/permitting\) phases,

decades of working in the field of crowd risk analysis and crowd safety.  
xvii xviii Preface  
crowd conditions that are hazardous to life and limb using tools, tech-  
niques and methods are all low-cost, easy to understand, easy to imple-  
ment and simple to apply.  
We hope you find this book both interesting and useful in applying a  
modelling approach to your own events and environments and that as a  
result of reading it you can be sure that it can, and will, make a difference  
to your crowd, to your event and to your peace of mind. Acknowledgements

G. Keith Still teaches crowd science at several UK universities. He has lec-  
tured at the UK Cabinet Office Emergency Planning College since 1999 and  
developed the EPC’s Crowd Dynamics and Crowd Science materials and  
workshops as well as contributing to several other safety-related courses.  
He is a fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, a fellow  
of the Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management and a spe-  
cialist fellow of the international institute of risk and safety management.  
Keith’s mathematical, human behaviour modelling and simulation tools  
have led to the development of a systematic blueprint for the crowd safety  
industry. His tools \(Legion, Paramics UAF, Myriad, Shepard, Tawaf,  
DWELL, Progressive Crowd Collapse and Crowd Pressure simulations\)  
have been used for the analysis of crowds in complex and built spaces for  
over a decade. He has also worked as a safety coordinator, safety advisor  
and expert witness on many of the world’s most dangerous and challenging  
events. He has developed educational workshops teaching the theory and  
applications of crowd science, which he has applied directly to major events  
around the world  
Although he has developed and used some of the most sophisticated  
crowd modelling and simulation tools, his work remains true to the prin-  
ciples of his original research\: to develop a model of crowds specifically  
aimed at improving crowd safety. To this aim his teaching and training  
programmes do not use computer simulations to model complex sites.

# Introduction  
Someone who builds a mathematical model can get carried away with  
all the clever things that can be done with it. The model becomes a safe  
little world, free from anxiety, free from office politics, rewarding in its  
own right. This often results in a very clever model that has little to do  
with reality.  
Sam L. Savage, author of INSIGHT.xla\: Business  
Analysis Software for Microsoft Excel  
This is not a book about the clever things you can do with a computer. Nor  
is this book about deep scientific discussion and argument, complex math-  
ematical techniques, simulations or computer technology. In fact, we argue  
that crowd simulations must be used with extreme caution when applied to  
major events—particularly if they relate to crowd safety.  
This is a book about how to apply simple, practical techniques to help  
you understand crowd risks. Specifically, this is a book in which we outline  
how to apply a range of tools and techniques to help you plan for crowds in  
places of public assembly at your event.  
We outline case studies where these tools have improved our understand-  
ing of event risk analysis and made a significant improvement to crowd  
safety around the world. We explore the underlying causes that can lead to  
mass fatalities, and provide the reader with a comprehensive, methodical,  
systematic approach to crowd risk analysis and safety engineering. The aim  
of this book is simple\: to improve your understanding of crowd risks; to  
help you plan for, and manage, your crowds safely.  
WHY DO WE NEED THIS?  
Around the world, event organisers are planning increasingly large, chal-  
lenging events while also trying to minimise expenditure, recoup costs  
and maximise profits. With larger events comes the potential for larger  
incidents, and, sadly, we are seeing an increase in crowd-related incidents  
around the world.  
1 2 Introduction to crowd science  
Crowd injuries—such as overcrowding and crushing—can be avoided  
through the application of foresight, planning and simple risk analysis tech-  
niques. Although crowds are just one element of an event plan, they are an  
element in which safety cannot be compromised.  
The event process, from conception to delivery, consists of three distinct  
phases\: planning, approval\* and operations. During the planning phase, the  
event organiser should define the event in a document that should include a  
safety concept and crowd management plan. This document will describe  
the event, its location and duration, and crowd capacity. It should detail the  
necessary emergency, contingency and safety plans, and it should include  
a comprehensive risk assessment that identifies various potential risks or  
hazards associated with the event.  
The event may require some form of approval \(e.g. a licence or permit\);  
during the approval phase the plan and risk assessment should be checked.  
If the plan and safety concept are deemed feasible, a licence or permit may  
be granted. This phase of the event is a quality assurance process and needs  
to be performed by a competent person. That person, or persons, must  
understand events and the associated crowd risks to ensure the plan is ‘fit for  
purpose’; that the risks have been identified and will be managed safely. The  
event will then run \(the operations phase\) in accordance with the event plan.  
The process varies from country to country, but the principles are the  
same\: planning, approval and operations are three phases of the event pro-  
cess where risk analysis techniques must be both understood and rigorously  
applied in order to be effective. Sadly, this is not always the case. There  
are many events where there are neither approval processes nor competent  
persons checking event safety. Furthermore, many events are unlicensed  
and remain outside of both scrutiny and sanction, with officials there-  
fore unable to enforce safety changes. Some of these may be significant  
crowd events, such as Christmas markets, air shows, fêtes, bonfires, street  
processions and victory parades, charity events, Christmas lights switch-  
on, book-signing, celebrity guest appearances and so on. As a result the  
approval process—a critical part of the safety model—may be neglected.  
Are simulations the answer?  
Over the last 25 years, we have developed a wide range of crowd simulation  
systems and applied them to crowd safety and risk analysis for many of the  
world’s largest and most challenging events. During the earlier years of our  
research, crowd simulations were essential tools. They helped us to develop  
an understanding of crowd risks, and they enabled us to experiment with a  
wide range of behavioural assumptions. You can experiment with crowds  
\*  
Various terms are used around the world; here, we will use the term ‘approval’ to cover all  
terms associated with licensing or permitting an event. Introduction 3  
in a computer-generated environment in a way that is simply not possible in  
real time \(for obvious safety reasons\). This proved to be essential in under-  
standing the interactions between crowds and their environment. With  
crowd simulations, we could understand how risks develop into incidents  
and how incidents can escalate into disasters, but the simulation approach  
was both expensive and time consuming.  
Embedded within the computer simulation, there is a mathematical  
model; this is a numerical recipe describing the crowd dynamics, the inter-  
actions and the way individuals behave in a range of situations. The crowd  
simulation is limited by the assumptions built into the mathematical model;  
the simulation process will not improve on an incorrect or unsuitable set of  
assumptions. As the saying goes, ‘Garbage in, garbage out’.  
In the original PhD research, we stated that a computer simulation would  
assist in both the event planning and the event approval processes. There  
were significant obstacles to achieving that goal. As we stated in the thesis  
\(http\://www.gkstill.com/CV/PhD/Chapter9.html\)\:  
There were three objectives to this research\: Firstly, to understand the  
nature of crowd dynamics with respect to crowd safety; secondly, to  
develop a more appropriate risk analysis methodology for the design  
and management of places where crowds may develop. Finally, to cre-  
ate a tool that allows others to understand the nature, problems and  
necessary components of crowds and crowd dynamics.

What we know  
We know more about crowds now than we did 25 years ago, but we may  
never know everything about crowds. There are many things we do not yet  
fully understand about the human condition. For example, how and why  
people react under normal and emergency situations; their decision-making  
process as individuals, as groups, as families and so forth. There are many  
elements we simply cannot measure, such as emotion, anger and aggres-  
sion levels. We do not know exactly how a wide range of internal or exter-  
nal factors—such as mood and weather, aggression and music—­ influence  
crowds. There is a long list of unknowns. We have to make assumptions  
about human behaviour for our mathematical models.  
Crowd simulations can help us to explore these assumptions and build  
better mathematical models. They are useful tools for exploring the theo-  
retical relationships between internal and external factors on the crowd,  
and there are many research applications for these types of simulations.  
Our focus is on crowd risk analysis and safety engineering, our concern  
being whether or not crowd simulation can make a significant improvement  
to the event planning process. 4 Introduction to crowd science  
Uses of a crowd simulation  
Some \(not all\) crowd analysis projects require complex computer simula-  
tions merely in order to develop an understanding of the complexity and  
degree of crowd interactions of people in spaces over time. For example, as  
a special advisor for crowd safety in Saudi Arabia, we worked on the design  
of the Jamarat Bridge \(Mina Valley\), where 3 million pilgrims perform the  
‘stoning of the devil’ ritual every day during Hajj \(the annual pilgrimage  
to Mecca\). This project involved a wide area where millions of pilgrims  
would be moving on five different levels, in multiple directions, completing  
complex rituals. Computer simulation was an important research tool in  
understanding the overall crowd dynamics across such a wide space and on  
so many levels of a complex structure. However, it was not the only tool we  
used to model, and understand the complexity of the site.  
Site mapping  
To understand crowd movements on the proposed new Jamarat Bridge,  
we started by mapping out the site on a drawing board using a series of  
overlays\: transparent sheets of drafting film, placed on top of the site plan.  
We drew the routes the crowds would take under normal and emergency  
situations, and checked dimensions such as travel distance and minimum  
width along those routes. In this way we could separate crowd flow, direc-  
tions, congestion, risk and most/least used spaces. It was an essential step  
in understanding the complexity of the site.  
We applied the same type of analysis to each of the five levels of the new  
bridge design and worked methodically, area-by-area, section-by-section,  
through the whole system. We dissected the site to help us build a clearer  
model of the overall crowd dynamic. Only when we had a complete con-  
struction of the crowd flow paths and areas of potential risk were we able  
to code those parameters into the computer simulation. This process of site  
analysis was key to understanding the large-scale complex environments  
where millions of pilgrims live, move, pray and perform the various rituals  
of Hajj.  
We were working with a range of site engineers and crowd safety opera-  
tions managers during this process, asking them key questions about man-  
agement techniques, infrastructure, systems integration, design constraints,  
information and communications systems. This was a very complex site and  
there were a lot of different groups working together to manage the area.  
We had to develop a systematic approach to collecting all the information  
relevant to normal and emergency processes and procedures. Capturing  
that information was challenging given the language differences, and we  
had to develop techniques of structuring the information for later ­ analysis.  
These processes—mapping the site, identifying crowd movements and Introduction 5  
areas of risk—were tools that helped us collect and collate information for  
later analysis.  
Workshops  
Closer to home, we have worked with the crowd management teams for the  
wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton \(2011\); London New Year  
events \(2006–2012\); and the London Olympics \(2012\). For these projects a  
combination of computer models, real-time data analysis, meta-models and  
the principles and applications of crowd science were fundamental to the  
event planning, risk analysis and safe management of the events. Typically,  
projects begin with a workshop where the various groups meet to outline  
their concerns, and resolutions are discussed and agreed.  
In addition to working on major projects, we have run teaching and train-  
ing programmes to help delegates understand the key issues around crowd  
risks and safety engineering principles. Out of these, two courses developed\:  
Introduction to Crowd Science \(a foundation degree course\) and Applied  
Crowd Science, BA \(Hons\). We have run 30–40 of these courses every year,  
around the world, where delegates bring their concerns to the workshop and  
we help them through the risk and safety analysis applications.  
Teaching and training  
Since early 2000, we have been teaching practical methods for crowd mod-  
elling, focussing on ‘simple to apply’ and ‘simple to understand’ techniques  
for assessing crowd risks and evaluating crowd safety strategies. We devel-  
oped a workshop approach to problem solving that was similar to what we  
were using in our consulting projects—to identify and catalogue the key  
information for crowd risk analysis. We teach the same methods as we use  
on major projects.  
Workshops had proven to be a successful means of understanding site-related  
issues while teaching delegates how to understand the fundamentals of crowd-  
related risks for major events. Delegates were typically crowd safety operations  
managers—the people who plan and operate events—so there was a wealth  
of practical experience to draw upon for our development projects, and good  
general understanding of the key issues related to crowd risks. Workshops  
have helped us develop better mathematical models of crowd behaviour and  
improve our understanding of crowd risks; specifically, they have helped us  
develop more appropriate crowd-modelling tools for crowd safety.  
As a result of running safety workshops for over 15 years, the teach-  
ing techniques and modelling tools we have developed are not academic  
or theoretical exercises\: they are based on real-world situations. They are  
practical and applicable tools, techniques and methodologies. Those tools  
are the subject of this book. 6 Introduction to crowd science  
CROWD MODELLING  
During these workshops we noted that there were many unreported crowd  
risks at major events. Specifically the delegates’ concerns were about safe-  
guarding against the risks of major incidents. As our focus is crowd safety,  
we developed methods to help the delegates to understand those risks and  
how to apply that understanding to their own events. We show delegates  
how to model crowd movement and how to map areas of potential risk.  
This helps the delegates transfer experience onto paper, and records the  
nature of those risks for further analysis.  
All of our projects start with the same fundamental modelling method of  
route and risk mapping. We have developed and used a wide range of site  
modelling tools to assist in this process. Sometimes it is more appropriate  
to use commercially available tools such as Google Earth and a variety of  
distance/route/area mapping software. Sometimes, a simple map, sketch  
or diagram of the site is sufficient to identify key areas of crowd risk. We  
use all of these tools to help delegates investigate a site, its transportation  
infrastructure, and available spaces for the crowds. This process helps the  
delegates build a model of how the crowd may move under both normal  
and emergency situations.  
Crowd safety projects  
We consult on major projects around the world, and every project begins  
by collecting information and collating it into a form we can analyse. Every  
analysis begins in a similar manner, with crowd flow diagrams and site  
sketches. This is the same fundamental process that we teach in the work-  
shops\: simple line drawings to understand the crowd flow and potential  
risks, area and flow mapping and flow calculations.  
Common to every project, we found that crowd risks could be identi-  
fied through the collection and collation of event information. For complex  
sites, where the use of crowd simulation may have been necessary, we still  
had to collect the same type of information and map out the site before  
coding the computer. We use that information to code the computer simula-  
tion, but the fundamentals of crowd risks are already apparent in the data  
collection and collation process. We asked ourselves the question, ‘What  
did the computer simulation tell us that we could not readily discover using  
the event information, the crowd flow and routing diagrams, the area and  
route mapping, risk analysis and mapping techniques?’  
The answer was very little—and it took a long time to realise this.  
Developing a crowd simulation took years; producing a good event simu-  
lation for a major project took weeks, sometimes months. Testing an event  
simulation took days and validating the crowd and event simulation also  
took time. Inevitably this led us to question our simulation approach. Did Introduction 7  
we really need the computer simulation? The time and cost of development  
of the computer simulation was considerable, the cost to the end user would  
have to reflect those development costs. We decided to revisit the procedure  
in order to see whether the cost of a computer simulation could be justi-  
fied, and, more importantly, whether there was a better, more cost-effective  
method of assessing risks for complex crowded environments.  
Project analysis  
All of our projects began with a series of meetings, during which the cli-  
ent would outline their key concerns. We would capture crowd and event  
information and distil it into three phases\: ingress \(how the crowds arrive  
and entered a site\); circulation \(how the crowds moved around the site\); and  
egress \(how the crowds would leave the site\). We would assess the crowd  
risks for all three phases under both normal and emergency situations.  
We would then review the site/event plans and perform an analysis of the  
system by simplifying the information into a series of models. We would  
map crowd movements as series of overlays on top of site plans; we would  
continue to refine this overlay process, mapping out the crowd movements  
for all three phases \(ingress, circulation and egress\) under normal and  
emergency situations.  
Each phase had two maps\: one for normal crowd movements, and another  
for emergency situations. When placed on top of each other, these layers  
provided us with a deeper insight into the nature of site design and crowd  
risk analysis. We could see how ingress, circulation and egress routing over-  
lapped in critical areas; at high density those areas could develop a risk of  
overcrowding. By tracing back along the routes towards those high-density  
areas, we could see where to implement crowd management procedures.  
If the event site was complex, we would take this overlay information  
and convert it into the parameters for our computer simulation system.  
The computer would enable us to test the sensitivity limits of those critical  
areas—for example, how long it may take for the approaching crowds to  
reach critical density. This process involves varying the initial conditions  
and observing any changes in the developing conditions. By performing  
a range of simulations, we could analyse the range of potential risks. The  
results of these simulations would be documented along with a set of rec-  
ommendations, typically in the form of a report and analysis, which would  
be produced and handed to the client for review. This would be followed by  
further meetings and, if required, more simulations.  
The simulation process was, in general, mostly a graphical display for the cli-  
ent’s benefit, to aid their understanding. The graphs, tables and reams of data  
that were produced by the simulation were included in the report and analy-  
sis of the site, but this was data that only a computer scientist would under-  
stand. This process certainly improved our own understanding of the crowd 8 Introduction to crowd science  
risks for complex environments, but did little to aid ­ clients’ ­ understanding of  
the fundamental principles of crowd risks. Top-level ­ clients—the executives,  
ministers and architects—typically only wanted to see the crowd moving on  
the computer simulation, to assure themselves that the site would function. It  
was someone else’s job to operate and manage the event.  
We were in a unique position of having complete input and control across  
all stages of the process. From a mathematical perspective, we would write  
algorithms turning human characteristics into computer formulae; as pro-  
grammers we could alter the internal algorithms in the simulation; and  
finally, as modellers \(and end users of the tools\) we could run simulations  
to test these hypotheses. If the results were not satisfactory, we could go  
back to the formulae, rewrite the algorithms, recode them into the models,  
retest the simulations and validate these against real-world observations.  
Our objective throughout this entire process was always to understand the  
limits of the crowd dynamic, to understand how risk might develop and  
then to alter the design, information or management processes to reduce  
those risks. The analysis of the crowd dynamic and the event/site risks were  
the inputs to the computer simulation; the data came from underlying mod-  
els of the site, our sketches and diagrams.  
When we discovered a risk, we did not use the computer simulations to  
fix the problem. The crowd simulation was not designed to provide solu-  
tions—only to quantify the location, duration and severity of the problem.  
We were using other tools, models, methods and techniques to address the  
risk mitigation or management process. For example, where a crowd man-  
agement solution was required, the question would be, ‘Where is the best  
place to manage crowds for this specific site?’ The answer to this would  
already have been established during the mapping process—by tracing  
back along the routes towards those high-density areas, we could see where  
to implement crowd management procedures. That was the pivotal point in  
the development of crowd science; we were only using the computer simula-  
tion to gain insight into the nature of specific site- or event-related crowd  
risks. The solutions were often discovered during the mapping process  
prior to running the computer simulation.  
Sometimes we recommended a design change \(such as barrier deploy-  
ment\) and could use the simulation to test the effectiveness of the design  
change. Other times we would recommend information requirements such  
as site maps, public instructions, public announcements, signage and stew-  
ards/ushers/marshals. Those elements we could not test in a computer sim-  
ulation. There were many options that could help us manage those risks,  
but the computer simulation did not give us solutions—it only helped to  
identify some of the problems. We still had to apply a design, information  
or, more typically, a management solution.  
The same is true of all other computer simulations in many other engi-  
neering disciplines\: simulations may help identify the nature of a problem; Introduction 9  
they may help you test one solution against another to see which is the most  
effective. But simulations alone rarely provide a solution to that problem.  
Simulation problems  
The temptation to leap straight to the computer is greatest when the prob-  
lem appears to be complex. We have observed many examples where crowd  
simulations have been applied to problems that appeared complex, but  
which could have been resolved using simpler methods. Computer simula-  
tions are simply tools; they are only as good as the underlying assumptions  
built into them. If these assumptions are unclear, the computer will not  
make them clearer. The results may look good, but they could be garbage!  
The problem is often compounded when a user has invested in a computer  
system and has to justify its expense. The ‘law of the instrument’, a concept  
described by the psychologist Abraham Maslow \(1908–1970\), illustrates  
this over-reliance on one tool \(Chapter 2, Section 5\)\:  
I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat  
everything as if it were a nail.  
Abraham Maslow  
Psychology of Science, 1966  
In general, to devise a solution to any problem you need to understand  
a wide range of potential solutions for that specific problem. You need to  
have some method of understanding which solution may work best; you  
need to develop a range of methodologies for problem solving, rather than  
relying on just one method. To accomplish this you can also study the ways  
in which others have solved similar problems, and which solutions they  
have found to work best.  
For crowd-related issues you need to understand how risks may be  
reduced, and how that risk reduction process can be measured or assessed  
in order to make the best improvements. This requires practice and a  
lot of experience, and you cannot practise on real crowds; mistakes can  
cost lives.  
Explore the risk  
Computer simulation is a tool that can help us explore and understand  
the elements that give rise to crowd risks. Crowd simulations may help  
quantify and qualify the scale of the problem, whether the risk is small,  
medium or great. The crowd simulation is not designed to provide solu-  
tions to risk management—only to assist in quantifying the location, dura-  
tion and severity of the risk. Crowd simulations may also mislead the user  
if the underlying mathematical models are inaccurate. Risk reduction, 10 Introduction to crowd science  
management and mitigation processes need to work with real crowds, not  
computer-simulated crowds.  
In the course of our work, and over many years of application in some of  
the world’s most challenging projects, we seriously questioned both the need  
and the value of the crowd simulation process for the following reasons\:  
•  
•  
•  
The simulations did not produce solutions. Our clients engaged us for  
solutions, usually because they had concerns relating to crowd risks. We  
needed tools, methods and frameworks in order to identify and reduce  
those risks; our role was not simply to tell a client he had a problem.  
The continual cost of developing and using computer simulations had  
to be recovered—primarily through increased consulting fees—and  
this was a financial barrier for many clients.  
A crowd simulation is a particularly complex process, and this meant  
developing highly skilled users. Selling a crowd simulation to a client  
meant they had to invest in skilled staff and simulation training; this  
was a significant investment that the client struggled to justify.  
As a result of these costs, organisers of many events, that were in need  
of risk analysis techniques, were not able to afford the process of crowd  
­ simulation—either as a product or as a service. The costs meant we were fail-  
ing to reach a wider audience, and hence failing to improve crowd safety. We  
were failing in our wider objective, which was to create a tool that allowed  
others to understand the nature and problems of crowd dynamics.  
Understanding crowd risks  
Having worked on many challenging international projects, we had exten-  
sive experience of crowd problems and risk analysis. We would not have  
achieved as much so quickly, or produced as many solutions, without the  
use of simulations, but we were in a unique position nonetheless.  
In the workshops, we were teaching the principles of crowd risk analysis  
and working with delegates \(experienced crowd safety operations manag-  
ers\) who had influence over crowd safety across a wide range of events, and  
who understood those risks. A diverse group attended the workshops, from  
stewards to police commanders with responsibility for indoor and outdoor  
events, large and small, the United Kingdom and abroad. Common ques-  
tions began to emerge\:  
How do we identify crowd risks in the planning phase of an event?  
How do we assess whether or not a system of entry/exit points will  
work?  
How do we manage the crowd flow into, around, and leaving a site?  
What are the key parameters of crowd risk and crowd safety? Introduction 11  
There was a wealth of information produced by the workshops, specifi-  
cally regarding near misses; accidents and incidents that did not reach the  
mainstream media and remained unreported and unknown. Also many  
best practices, across a wide range of events that were not being recorded  
or passed on to other parts of the industry. As a result of this ‘isolated  
experience’ there were significant gaps in fundamental understanding of  
crowd risks, risk management and the principles of risk mitigation across  
the industry as a whole.  
Mistakes made in one part of the country \(or indeed anywhere the  
world\), or at one particular type of event, or concerning a specific type of  
crowd behaviour, were neither captured nor published. We noted common  
mistakes—repeated time and time again—made at different events. When  
staff left an organisation their knowledge left with them, and when a new  
management team or event safety contractor arrived they often repeated  
previous mistakes. For over 20 years we have reviewed events, accidents  
and incidents, best practices, situations that came close to failure, near  
misses and so on, and we have integrated all of this information into the  
teaching and training programmes.  
Over the years, there were more than a few occasions when a new del-  
egate would outline an event we had seen before. For some events, the same  
problems, risk analysis or site issues were discussed again, with a new del-  
egate. We introduced new mapping processes and modelling techniques to  
ensure event information and knowledge were captured by the delegates;  
in effect we were learning how the industry should be learning and apply-  
ing these models. To enhance our teaching and training programmes, we  
developed an applied course, with individual training and specific focus on  
the delegates’ events. This led to a Foundation Degree module and a BA  
\(Hons\) module, respectively.  
RESEARCH BACKGROUND  
When we began our research into crowds, we did so from a background  
of mathematical modelling, computer science and operations research.\* We  
were also fortunate enough to be offered unlimited access to the Wembley  
complex \(London\), which meant working with the operations teams at the  
stadium, arena and conference centre. As a result, we could study many of  
the challenges faced in hosting major international events—from both the  
management and the crowds’ perspective.  
Although Wembley has an excellent safety record, the operations direc-  
tor, police and safety managers were always looking for ways to improve,  
\*  
A scientific discipline dealing with the application of advanced analytical methods to  
improve decision making. 12 Introduction to crowd science  
to understand and reduce the risks to crowds. This is one of the key ele-  
ments in crowd safety and risk analysis\: a diligent and proactive crowd  
management team, always looking for better methods, better informa-  
tion and better tools to assist them in their job; always looking to improve  
crowd and event safety. This was typical of the clients we worked with, and  
specifically of the delegates who came on the workshops.  
Risk management  
Understanding risks and managing risks are two different disciplines. The  
workshop delegates wanted to understand crowd risk in order to keep their  
crowds as safe as possible; workshops were designed to facilitate risk analy-  
sis, to understand what may happen when things do not go exactly to plan.  
The delegates wanted to learn about crowd safety, from a scientific perspec-  
tive, and to develop management tools that would help them understand  
the dynamics of risk. Furthermore, risks can change over time; a crowd’s  
reaction to a certain situation may not always be the same. The crowd’s  
perception of a risk can change, but the risk may remain unchanged. For  
example, during one project we evaluated risks of trips, slips and falls on a  
street environment during road works. The risk was constant, it remained  
unchanged, but as people walked past the road works they would pay less  
and less attention to the hazard. Their perceptions of the risk were dimin-  
ishing with each pass-by although the risk remained constant.  
It was at that point the research took a dramatic turn.  
Improving crowd safety  
The aim of our original research was to improve crowd safety. We knew  
of two incidents where mass fatalities had occurred on sites that had used  
crowd simulations and were passed as ‘safe’; we know of many more sites  
where management teams have struggled to maintain crowd safety after  
the site has been built. Many of these designs have also passed as ‘safe’ in a  
crowd simulation system. Crowd simulations seemed to be failing to iden-  
tify many of the crowd risks, and this was a significant cause for concern.  
Clients who wanted crowd simulation were typically site design teams—  
groups who were interested in value engineering and making the most  
economical use of their spaces, and for design-related analysis, crowd simu-  
lations were very useful. We could test one solution against another, which  
meant we could investigate the value of two different solutions and under-  
stand how best to utilise key areas and space, but this was not risk analysis\:  
it was value engineering.  
Risk analysis, and risk management, is an event planning and approval  
process, not a site design function. Our objectives were to understand Introduction 13  
crowd risk and to develop improved methods of addressing those risks; the  
simulations did not help us in that process.  
Safe little world  
We began our work by writing code and algorithms \(mathematical for-  
mulae\), and by designing and programming systems. As computer scien-  
tists, we were using computer simulations with confidence and control in  
programming parameters and environments. We also knew the limitations  
of our models and how easily they could become ‘a safe little world, free  
from anxiety, free from office politics, rewarding in its own right’. We  
could build environments and computer-generated landscapes, and we  
programmed the entire system from algorithm to end-user application. We  
could also test the environment in every way we wanted; in the right hands,  
these tools did \(and still do\) offer the trained engineer significant insights  
into crowd dynamics. But they were far from the goal of actually improving  
crowd safety, since these were complex systems to program and use, and  
expensive to purchase. Beyond the budget, and skills, of the event planners  
licensing/approval authorities and crowd managers.  
An end user of a crowd simulation requires a wide range of skills and  
a multidisciplinary approach to the scientific exploration of crowds.  
Simulation systems can include behaviour \(psychology\), management and  
operational practices, crowd reactions, influence from external factors,  
physics, dynamics, computer programming skills and data analysis. This  
scientific skill set is not the same as that of the groups who work with and  
understand the fundamentals of crowd risks.  
Crowd management  
We have had the pleasure of working with crowd managers, planning and  
managing major events who have far more insight, knowledge and expe-  
rience than that provided by our computer simulations. A good crowd  
management team is both proactive and reactive to changing crowd situ-  
ations. Crowds can—and do—react to many different influences during  
an event; a good crowd safety operations manager, with specific \(and  
often expansive\) knowledge of their specific environment, would adapt  
to the dynamics of the environment. Crowd safety operations managers  
tend not to be computer users \(beyond word processors or accounting  
spreadsheets\).  
We realised we had a problem\: how would our computer simulations  
achieve the objective of improving safety if the people who needed them  
most were not computer users? This was a difficult paradigm to change. 14 Introduction to crowd science  
WHO ARE THE END USERS OF CROWD  
SIMULATION?  
Using and understanding a crowd simulation system requires a significant  
capital investment—first to buy the system, and then to train people to use  
it effectively. The problem was cost. Event planners, the approval authori-  
ties and crowd safety operations managers—the people who have the most  
influence on crowd safety—simply did not have the budget for crowd simu-  
lation systems.  
Crowd simulations were therefore not going to achieve our goal of  
improving crowd safety.  
Realising the problem  
The simulations we designed had only one real purpose\: to understand the  
nature of crowd risks. Ultimately, we were aiming to define better opera-  
tional guidance for places of public assembly. That guidance would only be  
of use to the crowd safety operations manager if they understood how to  
apply it and understood the risk analysis process. To improve crowd safety,  
we needed first to understand the needs of the crowd safety operations man-  
agers—the people who would have most impact on crowd safety.  
If we were going to succeed in our objective, it would have to be redefined\:  
we would have to make it compatible with the events industry business model.  
Safety budget  
The events industry is a business, and businesses need to make profit in  
order to exist. Worldwide, the events industry is worth an estimated \$500  
billion, with profits rising annually. Businesses survive on profit margins  
and need to maintain cost controls in order to do so; safety does not con-  
tribute to the profits of the business.  
The events safety officer and/or crowd safety operations manager are  
often fighting for resources and budget \(cost\). Event organisers typically  
want as many people as possible at their event in order to maximise their  
investment \(profit\). Safety managers want to maximise safety at the event  
\(cost\). There is a long list of resources required for safe event management,  
such as staff costs, staff equipment and clothing, appropriate staff training,  
radios and control room hardware, and larger events require significant  
investment for safety infrastructure \(cost\). Crowd safety systems are like  
insurance; you need to invest in safety \(cost\) but there is no return on that  
investment \(cost but no profit\). Investment in safety always has the same  
outcome\: nothing untoward happens! All cost, no profit.  
With event organisers looking to maximise returns and save on costs, the  
safety budget is always under pressure. This creates a problem with cost Introduction 15  
justification for further safety measures\: typically the comment ‘If nothing  
happened last time, why do we need further investment?’ This attitude  
made computer systems difficult to both define and justify as a cost-versus-  
benefit analysis. If you cannot measure the improvement to crowd safety  
when there are no tangible elements to measure, the best you can hope for is  
no incidents; how could the business justify improved safety systems using  
computer simulations?  
There are only a few super-events worldwide per year; they are a consul-  
tants’ market, and an expert using expert tools can \(and will\) provide valuable  
services in this market. But this was not the market where the most improve-  
ments could be made towards risk reduction and safer crowd management.  
Prices driven down  
There are several companies around the world selling crowd simulation  
systems \(and high-level training\) to consultants. These are of use in major  
projects, during the design phase and for value engineering purposes. It  
takes an expert to understand the crowd simulation output as well as the  
input; this expertise comes from experience of crowds and not from the  
computer simulations. We have noted many so-called ‘crowd experts’ pub-  
lishing materials relating to crowds—specifically design-related concepts—  
that a crowd safety operations manager would reject.  
If not used correctly by experts, with crowd management experience,  
who can understand both the limitations to their simulation and the risks  
in the real world, crowd simulations can be dangerous. More worryingly,  
there are also many competing crowd simulation developers with no crowd  
management experience\: computer scientists who sell consulting services  
to the events industry. These services compete for the same clients and  
prices are driven down, margins become tighter and shortcuts are inevita-  
bly taken. This is a problem lying in wait when those sites and events are  
realised, when the computer simulations of crowds are evaluated against  
real crowds. We know of two sites where this has already occurred and the  
consequence was mass fatalities.  
Not the way to go  
Crowd simulations seemed to be going against everything we had worked  
towards, which was to produce a tool that could be used to improve crowd  
safety. Furthermore, the area we could make most impact was not at the  
top end of the market \(the so-called ‘mega-events’ such as the Olympics\)—it  
was the lower-budget events that we saw the accidents occur, where safety  
is perceived as a cost and not as a benefit. A review of the history of acci-  
dents and incidents shows that those were the events where risk analysis  
and safety improvements are most required. 16 Introduction to crowd science  
It was obvious that in order to improve a global understanding of crowd  
risks, and to develop safety engineering standards, we had to aim at a low-  
cost solution. Training is one method of achieving that goal, and we con-  
tinue to develop workshops and courses to help improve understanding  
of crowd risks. At the time of writing this book we are loading eLearning  
materials for an international audience.  
New objective  
We have outlined the financial drivers for crowd safety in the event industry  
and the reasons why cost–benefit analysis is a barrier to software simula-  
tions being universally adopted across the industry. Our new objective was  
to improve crowd risk analysis and safety engineering at a minimum cost  
to the end user.  
UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM  
Over the last decade a more worrying factor was arising. As we continue  
to deliver methods of both reaching and teaching the principles and appli-  
cations of crowd science to the industry, we have observed many different  
types of simulations appearing on the market. Some of the new generation  
of tools are good, others are not so good. Some of these simulations should  
be avoided at all cost. We also see many new consultants offering safety  
services; the market is becoming competitive, driving prices downwards,  
and this is leading to inexperienced users investing in the cheapest possible  
simulation and/or services. In general, where costs come down, quality also  
declines.  
These factors are driving the industry towards a false sense of safety.  
We need to expand on this specific point in order to raise awareness of the  
underlying risks of using a crowd simulation for safety applications.  
Safety-critical systems  
A fundamental problem with crowd simulation is that the user needs to  
understand the tools, models and simulations and the underlying princi-  
ples of crowd safety. If the subject materials have been studied extensively  
\(crowd risk analysis\), in the right hands these can be very useful tools. In  
the hands of an inexperienced end user, these tools could be used indis-  
criminately, with little or no understanding of risk or consequences. In such  
cases, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing; the illusion of safety  
and certainty is projected. There can be no uncertainties in safety-critical  
systems. Introduction 17  
For any engineering discipline—specifically where safety is concerned—  
we need to define standards, acceptable validation limits, tolerances and  
safety criteria for operation. We also need to understand and adopt rigorous  
risk management standards, and exposure to risk should be mitigated with  
appropriate, qualified training and risk assessment procedures. Typically,  
in the engineering disciplines, standards are tested, reviewed, published,  
adopted, utilised and reviewed by professional engineers, who have been  
assessed in their discipline and have attained the required standards recog-  
nised by their peers, and who have demonstrated their competence by regu-  
larly having their skills tested and confirmed by a regulating authority. This  
is a professional approach, but we find no such approach related to crowd  
safety, to event planning or to crowd management. The events industry is  
not formally regulated in the same way as other safety-critical industries.  
We argue throughout this book that crowd safety and crowd risk analysis  
should be considered in a similar way to other engineering disciplines, with  
appropriate standards, validation and regulation.  
Towards a standard  
For decades, we have used a combination of many skills—not just computer  
simulation—to assess risk and to engineer solutions. Two key processes  
have been common to all projects\: the first relates to capturing the project  
information, extracting the fundamentals of the project, and interview-  
ing and distilling the basic information about specific events and incidents  
from the crowd safety operations manager’s experience of those events.  
The second relates to visualising that information in order to process all  
the available data in a systematic and methodical manner. We were using  
several different techniques to capture information, and a question began  
to formulate\: could this approach, this knowledge and experience, be cap-  
tured and passed on to other end users?  
The tools we used were designed to assimilate crowd risks from multiple  
perspectives and to provide us with a framework for crowd safety engineer-  
ing. We had to design these methods to capture and process the unique  
characteristics of specific events \(both in the United Kingdom and abroad\)  
from a wide range of sources, cultures, backgrounds and educational levels.  
We had to arrange this information in such a way that it could later be com-  
pared and contrasted to other events, other risks and other solutions for  
crowd safety and event analysis. It became our template for any/all events  
as we refined the methods and integrated them across a wider range of  
projects. This developed as a consequence of working across many events,  
in many countries, over many years.  
We noticed that the key problems of crowd risk analysis and safety engi-  
neering had a common set of characteristics; there was a set of best prac-  
tices, but these were neither captured nor documented. Either globally, or 18 Introduction to crowd science  
event by event. The information remained, by and large, retained only in  
the memory of the crowd safety operations manager, for specific problems.  
There were other noticeable event issues\: crowd management is a combi-  
nation of many different facets and skills, not least of which is the knowl-  
edge learned through practical experience. There was no adequate process  
of capturing the previous managers’ knowledge and experience, other than  
on-the-job training or word of mouth. These methods were inconsistent  
and often left gaps in knowledge of specific sites or events, especially in  
an industry that has a high staff turnover. Valuable experience was lost,  
mistakes were remade and important safety lessons missed. There had to  
be a better way!  
Capturing information  
There is a lot of information required for crowd risk analysis and safety  
engineering for events, but it can be very specific to a particular event, loca-  
tion or time of year. Much of this information is required during planning  
and approval process but may not feature for the operational requirements  
of the control room during an event. For example, planning functions that  
include crowd intelligence; risks that may be specific to a history of crowd  
behaviour; localised behaviour—these are planning and approval issues.  
They are not specifically operational issues for running an event, but they  
are necessary for planning it.  
Crowd management is a function of both the planning and operational  
issues for an event. Developing a crowd management plan without crowd  
management experience can be a dangerously misguided task. As a conse-  
quence, there are a wider range of skills and knowledge required for the  
development of a good crowd management process. As such the ‘model-  
ling’ process \(not crowd simulations\) can be very useful in understanding  
the spectrum of crowd dynamics and the crowd risk analysis for planning,  
approval and operations of an event.  
Understanding the audience  
There is a potentially dangerous niche market for crowd simulations.  
Company executives, looking to have their egos stroked and confidence  
assured in their investment; computer scientists who have played with crowd  
computer systems in their safe little world, free from anxiety and far from  
the crowds. The latter are consultants selling services to the former\: it is an  
interesting cycle to observe.  
Both groups are far removed from the heart of crowd safety issues. Neither  
consultants nor executives attended our crowd safety workshops—those  
were entirely populated by crowd safety operations managers, operators, Introduction 19  
emergency services and licensing \(approval\) officers from local authorities,  
who needed to understand risk but had no budget for computer simulations.  
To achieve our objective \(to improve crowd risk analysis and safety engi-  
neering at minimum cost to the end user\), we needed to develop tools that  
could be used by crowd safety operations managers, not computer simula-  
tions that could only be used and understood by computer scientists. What  
was needed was an pragmatic solution—something that could be taught,  
that could capture vital knowledge and experience of crowd safety opera-  
tions managers, that could capture best practises and define causes of major  
incidents. Something that could actually improve crowd safety. Training  
was proving to be beneficial, so we began to introduce modelling to the  
training programmes. This approach was far more readily accepted, being  
both low-cost and quick to implement. It also put the tools where they  
could be best utilised.  
LEARNING FROM PAST EXPERIENCE  
The skill set required for safe crowd management is understated, typically  
learned through experience, and can be site- or event specific. Near misses  
are rarely documented, and neither are things that work well. The events  
industry has no requirement for formal qualifications—either for crowd  
risk analysis or crowd safety engineering; the risk assessment process is,  
at best, subjective and in general unstructured. There is a clear need for a  
more formalised approach to best practices, and for the continual devel-  
opment of information capture systems to improve our understanding of  
events and, specifically, to reduce accident potential.  
We have observed crowd safety operations managers; worked across a  
range of events; attended many hundreds of event and site briefings and  
reviewed over 100 years’ worth of crowd accidents and incidents from  
around the world. There were three common elements to the fundamental  
causes of major incidents, yet there was no process of capturing this infor-  
mation, no formalisation of best practices and no methods of recording or  
reporting near misses beyond the event teams at that event. The knowl-  
edge of each site, each event, appeared to be unique to that event or site, so  
there was no perception of common modes of failure across the industry and  
around the world.  
There are, of course, many elements common to planning and crowd  
risk analysis, specifically with respect to crowd dynamics and crowd safety,  
but it became obvious that capturing information, best practices and near  
misses—and understanding the underlying causality of major incidents—  
was essential to improving crowd risk analysis. Safety engineering for the  
events industry is a challenge that it has taken over a decade to come to 20 Introduction to crowd science  
terms with, to formulate and to understand; making information widely  
available to the events industry is equally challenging.  
Event planning  
The process of event planning has many facets, and they are the subject of  
many books, courses and published guidance on the topic. A good event  
planner \(organiser\) will be well versed in economics, marketing, schedul-  
ing, contracts and many other subjects. They will be familiar with building  
codes, fire codes, licensing and health and safety regulations. Although  
there is much useful and easily accessible information on the topic of safety,  
most of it focuses on the physical environment \(such as number of exits, fire  
suppression systems, rates of passage, etc.\).  
Typically, crowd safety is divided into two main areas\: risk assessment  
\(prior to the event\) and crowd management \(during the event\). Risk assess-  
ment should be a process of assessing a site for its unique attributes and  
applying a rigorous methodology to either mitigate and/or manage risks.  
Many event plans are simply ‘cut and paste’ from previous plans; last year’s  
plan dusted off, a new date put on the front, or, worse still, a previous event  
plan re-titled and presented to the approval authority for a different event!  
We ask that question time and again during the workshops. Cut and paste  
is a common practise.  
The approval process for evaluating the event plan and risk assessment  
must be equally stringent in its analysis before they can be signed off as ‘fit  
for purpose’. This, of course, means the approval authority must under-  
stand crowd risk analysis in order to perform their duties to an appropri-  
ate standard and avoid crowd accidents. It needs to be highlighted that  
approving a plan that may not work allows risk to materialise and can  
result in criminal charges of negligence.  
Although there are many courses on event planning, there are few  
courses dedicated to crowd risk analysis and to risks that relate to the  
crowd dynamic—and specifically to the identification, classification and  
resolution of crowd risks from first principles. We ask the same question  
on every workshop we run \(over 6000 people so far\)\: ‘How many people  
have had a close call at an event?’ Every time we ask this, and hear the  
‘near miss’, ‘close call’ and ‘almost a disaster’ replies, we are reminded that  
there are many more sites and events that are potentially incidents waiting  
to happen, due to the lack of a rigorous approach to crowd risk analysis.  
Risk assessments  
The risk assessment is a key document in both understanding and managing  
crowd risks. When we run crowd safety workshops we often ask, ‘Who has  
read their risk assessment?’ One delegate once replied that this function was Introduction 21  
subcontracted, outsourced and that company X did all of the risk analysis  
work for them! The delegate neither understood the process, nor realised that  
the risk analysis is only one small part of the safety process. This was not a  
unique situation; we have asked the same question many hundreds of times  
around and received similar replies. Often we ask, ‘Who has written a risk  
analysis?’ Most confess they had simply copied the bulk of their risk assess-  
ment from another event, ignoring the process of risk analysis altogether.  
Risk mitigation, risk reduction, risk management, risk reporting\: these  
are all required for both large and small crowds at events. It is a process  
that should not be neglected, either during the event planning or the event  
approval phase. The bigger the event, the greater the range of risk consid-  
erations that may apply—the more detailed and meticulous you need to be  
in the risk analysis process. It is not a checklist; it should be an active docu-  
ment that engages both the person/team that performs the analysis of risks  
and the person/people who have to mitigate those risks during an event.  
Yet it generally appears to be a poorly understood and poorly implemented  
process. We do have experience of excellence in this process—specifically  
during the crowd management planning for the Royal Wedding in 2011,  
where the risk analysis, management and risk ownership were the major  
topics for most of the planning meetings—but this is the exception rather  
than the rule.  
An important aspect of our research objectives \(how to improve the risk  
analysis process\) became clearer over the years. Both crowd management  
and risk analysis were mostly based on ‘on-the-job’ experience and not a  
formalised methodology. Ask two people to assess the same risks and you  
will often get a very different set of results. As such the current risk analysis  
process is highly subjective, being based on personal perception and experi-  
ence. Budgets for this aspect of event planning and the subsequent approval  
process are typically hard-fought, and the whole process is underfunded  
and subject to time constraints due to the lack of formal crowd risk analysis  
methodologies. Which is one of the many reasons why ‘cut and paste’ of the  
risk assessment and the event plan, is so common, and so terribly wrong.  
Reality hits home  
The delegates who came on the courses and workshops were providing us  
with a wide range of event issues and concerns. We began cataloguing the  
key issues—near misses, things that worked, industry best practices—and we  
began to get a clearer understanding of the crowd safety operations manag-  
ers, who struggled for budget and were looking for solutions. We also devel-  
oped a faster approach to collecting the relevant information about crowd  
dynamics and crowd risk from the workshops. Furthermore, we were gain-  
ing insights across the whole industry, from different perspectives \(the police,  
event organisers, licensing officers and crowd safety operations managers\). 22 Introduction to crowd science  
The main problem was, and still is, an inconsistent approach to the event  
planning process. There are no standards for an event plan, no criteria to  
determine whether or not it is fit for its intended purpose—unless it fails and  
comes under scrutiny. Therein lies another issue with the events industry\: as  
previously stated, near misses are not recorded or passed on to others; best  
practices are not learned and then have to be relearned. There was no pro-  
cess of either capturing or sharing best practices. Information was simply  
lost. Introducing standards and improving crowd safety conditions needed  
to be linked to the event planning process; we appeared to have a methodol-  
ogy, and we had experience of teaching that methodology, but we could not  
reach the whole industry, around the world, by teaching small classes.  
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM  
Event safety plans are a requirement for licensed UK events, but they are  
subjective documents, presented in a wide range of formats,\* reviewed by  
local authorities who may or may not have had appropriate training in risk  
analysis and safety certification. This extract from the Health and Safety  
Executive \(HSE\) gives some idea of the types of things an event planner  
requires for safe crowd management†\:  
As an organiser you must as far as reasonably practicable ensure the  
safety of visiting crowds. While certain aspects of crowd safety can be  
allocated to contractors, for example stewarding, you will retain over-  
all responsibility for ensuring the safety of the public.  
Hazards presented by a crowd\:  
Crushing between people, crushing against fixed structures, such as  
barriers. Trampling underfoot. Surging, swaying or rushing. Aggressive  
behaviour.  
Dangerous behaviour, such as climbing on equipment or throwing  
objects.  
Hazards presented by a venue\:  
Slipping or tripping due to inadequately lit areas or poorly maintained  
floors and the build-up of rubbish. Moving vehicles sharing the same  
route as pedestrians.  
Collapse of a structure, such as a fence or barrier, which falls onto  
the crowd. People being pushed against objects, such as unguarded hot  
\*  
We have reviewed over 1000 event plans, crowd management plans and safety plans over  
the last decade.

cooking equipment on a food stall. Objects, such as stalls, which obstruct  
movement and cause congestion during busy periods. Crowd movements  
obstructed by people queuing at bars, etc. Cross-flows as people cut  
through the crowd to get to other areas, such as toilets. Failure of equip-  
ment, such as turnstiles. Sources of fire, such as cooking equipment.  
It is an unstructured list, and similar lists are presented in various guid-  
ance documents in the United Kingdom \(and around the world\). The unstruc-  
tured nature of the list leads to an unstructured approach to the problem of  
risk analysis. As a result, risk and hazard identification is treated in the same  
unstructured manner, typically as a checklist in a risk assessment document.  
The guidance needs to be updated to include a formalised structure to the risk  
assessment process; otherwise, the haphazard nature of the above list is read  
as a methodology. The approval process needs to be similarly structured, and  
competent individuals need to check the event risk assessment, otherwise, the  
process is failing the ultimate duty of care to the public attending events.  
Vision and imagination  
From the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Report, there is a specific com-  
ment in Chapter 2, section 59 that reads\:  
It is not enough to aim only at the minimum measures necessary for  
safety. That has been, at best, the approach in the past and too often  
not even that standard has been achieved. What is required is the vision  
and imagination to achieve a new ethos…  
Although the aforementioned comment was written for football, it is true  
of any event where the minimum measures necessary and the lowest pos-  
sible cost approach are adopted. Where a new event is planned on a green-  
field site,\* crowd safety and crowd risks may be unknown. A first principles  
approach was required to replace the ‘cut and paste’ from old event plans.  
As events have grown over the years and crowd numbers have increased,  
new risks have developed. For example, sites that may function safely for  
5000 people may not work at all for 5500 people. In addition to the need  
for a first principles approach was the need for vision and imagination in  
order to achieve this new ethos.  
The computer tools we had designed, developed and used for test-  
ing the site design and areas of the built and complex environment had  
provided some valuable insights into the nature of crowd dynamics and  
\*  
The term ‘greenfield’ was originally used in construction and development to reference land  
that has never been used \(e.g. green or new\), where there was no need to demolish or rebuild  
any existing structures. In relation to events, the term is used where an event will occur on  
a site not previously used for that event. 24 Introduction to crowd science  
crowd risks. These tools, as we had discovered during our research, were  
not the right tools for the problem in hand. We wanted to capture the  
information, knowledge and experience of crowd safety operations man-  
agers, because the industry needed a structured, pragmatic and, above  
all, easy-to-use approach to the problem. Without structure, you cannot  
be either efficient or effective—and that is where the next chapter of the  
research began.  
A new approach  
As stated in the PhD thesis\:  
Safety design methodology based on the present guidelines using unit  
widths of exit with no consideration to familiar routes, focal routes,  
psychological factors or crowd dynamics require reconsideration. \[…\]  
Taken without the interpretation of a competent person, the relevance  
of exit widths may meet the statutory requirements. However, as we  
have demonstrated, they may not meet the physical needs to safely and  
efficiently evacuate the occupants in an emergency situation.  
\[…\]  
The ultimate goal is to drive through the legislature that a simulation  
should be a statutory requirement of a licence to operate a place of  
public assembly. We propose replacing the need for a competent person  
with the need for a competent simulation. It is hoped that the crowd  
simulation tool represents a new wave in the understanding of crowd  
safety through the study of crowd dynamics.  
With the benefit of hindsight, this last statement was naive. At the time  
we did not appreciate the necessary expertise required for the end users, nor  
did we appreciate that a successful crowd simulation required of the user a  
combination of operational experience, understanding of crowd safety and  
human behaviour, and computer science.  
Simulations were not the way forward  
As previously stated, simulation tools were only useful in the hands of  
experts, and only for a few major events where both ample time and bud-  
get were available. What we failed to understand at that time was the pro-  
cess around planning—the people involved in the approval and delivery of  
a major event. This is a low-cost process; the individuals involved in these  
processes have no scientific training for event planning or the event approval  
process. They are low-paid employees, not computer scientists. The solution  
must fit the problem in order to be accepted, and cost is a major factor in that Introduction 25  
acceptance. The simulation-based solution was a dead-end. The model-based  
solution is low-cost, easy to implement and can be readily adopted with some  
basic training. We have delivered that type of training, and the impact on the  
industry is clear in both the planning and approval processes.  
RESEARCH REVISITED  
We have catalogued and reviewed accidents and incidents, looking for the  
common denominators \(the DNA of mass fatalities and major incidents\),  
evaluating which factors lead to incidents and how these factors may be  
avoided in the future. We have also listened to the delegates at our work-  
shops, noted their event-related problems and catalogued the different  
types of models we could use to help solve these problems. Over the last  
fifteen years we have never had to use a computer simulation in the class-  
room to solve a delegate’s problem regarding crowd risk analysis and safety  
engineering. We use some tools to help us visualise crowd density and risk,  
to measure spaces and to define routes, but these are not simulations—they  
are measurement tools. These simpler computerised tools were far more  
useful for developing lecture content, examples, illustrations and video  
clips to help improve the understanding of crowd risks and safety issues.  
We also continued to develop many new simulation systems to help  
us understand risk, but the output was always the same—better educa-  
tional materials. These materials are all relatively straightforward to teach,  
quickly adopted into working practices and, most importantly, designed to  
capture important knowledge and best practices in a form that others can  
pick up, understand and use. In short, we had found a much simpler solu-  
tion—a low-cost solution—and an easy way of implementing this solution.  
It was an effective means of crowd risk analysis and safety engineering.  
Cost-effective crowd safety modelling  
In all our project work we were using a first principles approach, mapping  
and sketching the fundamentals of complex environments, developing a  
robust method of analysing the key elements of risk and safety, using a wide  
range of analytical techniques to break complex systems into manageable  
segments, and then \(and only then, if we were to gain a deeper understand-  
ing of possible failures in very complex environments\) would we apply a  
computer simulation. We were only using simulations to understand failure  
modes—never for proof of concept. The principles we adopt are simple\: once  
you understand how crowds are exposed to risks, you can use operational  
information and management system to minimise the exposure to those  
risks. You can change design, retest the site and, by a process of an inte-  
grated design, information and management solution, outline how complex 26 Introduction to crowd science  
environments need to work. Control, monitoring and ongoing evaluation of  
crowd flow needs to take place in order to minimise crowd risks.  
Our main research tools were pen and paper. This has been reflected, and  
refined, in the workshop teaching methods over the years. What the work-  
shop delegates needed was an insight into modelling process, and access to  
the tools that would help them develop the skills required to perform their  
own analysis. They needed a method of understanding the fundamentals  
of risk, and hence they needed to define the principles and applications of  
these tools towards crowd safety.  
There were, of course, significant challenges in developing a practical  
solution. The tools we used needed a training course that would benefit  
\(not confuse\) the target audience. These tools needed, by definition, to be  
low-cost, easy to understand \(and hence implement\) and to adopt into the  
mainstream of the phases of event planning and event approval. The design  
and delivery of the crowd science workshops needed to focus on the pri-  
mary objectives of the original research; to understand the nature of crowd  
dynamics with respect to crowd safety; to develop a more appropriate risk  
analysis methodology for the design and management of places where  
crowds gather; to create tools that allow others to understand the nature,  
problem and components of crowd safety.

you feed him for a lifetime.

The direction was clear\: information, education and application.  
Conclusions  
This chapter stresses the following point from several different perspec-  
tives\: it is essential to understand the needs and frustrations of the end  
user—the crowd safety operations manager. There is a need for a simple,  
back-to-basics approach to the domain of crowd risk analysis from a sci-  
entific perspective. There is a need for standards and for qualifications in  
crowd risk analysis and safety engineering; there is a need to capture and  
share best practices through the application of standards and appropriate  
training. One only needs to look at the scale of major events around the  
world and historical records of crowd-related incidents to understand that  
need. Which is why, after years of being asked the same question—‘Why  
don’t you write a book?’—we present here the principles and applications  
of crowd science, with a focus on risk analysis, risk dynamics and crowd  
safety as it relates to event planning, event licensing and event operations  
around the world. Chapter 2

INTRODUCTION  
One of the most interactive demonstrations we use in the workshops is a  
series of density experiments using a fixed area. These are important ele-  
ments in understanding both the physical \(number of people per square  
metre\) and psychological \(how it feels\) factors in crowded spaces. These  
experiments illustrate a common failure in event planning\: the temptation  
to focus on capacity and not on how the spaces are going to be used. We  
may, for example, have a vast area available for the event but still experience  
crowd-crushing problems if the stage area is badly designed, or entry and exit  
systems are not suitably arranged/wide enough. In this chapter, we shall con-  
struct up a series of models for both static and dynamic spaces, areas where  
the crowd is predominantly stationary \(static\) and where it is predominantly  
moving \(dynamic\) to assist the event planner, licensing officer and opera-  
tion teams to recognise crowd risks. This is important because the event will  
shape the crowds behaviour, specifically how crowds react to risks.  
An issue we have encountered over the years, specifically during the  
investigation into personal injury and mass fatalities for expert witness tes-  
timony, is how poorly defined the legal terms are in the context of crowd  
problems. One factor that influences this is the ‘blame the crowd’ attitude  
of the media. In the Daily Telegraph \(2001\), an article describes a short his-  
tory of football disaster. The language used is both emotive and misleading;  
27 28 Introduction to crowd science  
the emphasis, as you can see from the language used in the headlines below,  
is to blame the crowd\:

This language also fogs the investigation of such events, as it deflects the  
blame away from the event organisers and towards an amorphous entity \(the  
crowd\) where no single individual is to blame. When emotive \(and incorrect\)  
words such as ‘stampede’ or ‘panic’ are used to describe the crowds’ behav-  
iour it directs the blame towards the crowd and it can be difficult to attribute  
causality, and reality, of the situation. The language permeates the media,  
enters our vocabulary and the crowd is thought of as a ‘dangerous entity’. We  
have seen events where the organisers immediately appear on the media \(TV/  
radio\) and blame the crowds’ behaviour; this deflects responsibility away from  
poor planning, negligent risk assessment and incompetent management.  
Since 2001, the headlines continue to attribute blame by the constant, and  
inappropriate, use of the words ‘panic’ and ‘stampede’.

BASIC PLANNING/APPROVAL REQUIREMENT  
If you review the history of accidents and incidents you will find a mis-  
match between the crowd size/numbers attending the event and the area  
available for that crowd. This implies that there may be some fundamental  
errors in the design and/or use of crowded spaces, or a failure to apply an  
appropriate risk analysis methodology. To establish whether or not there  
were errors in the calculation of either the capacity or the throughput, of  
major incidents, we need to understand the principles of crowd density Crowd risk analysis 31  
and the nature and dynamics of overcrowding incidents. We also need to  
understand the core competency skills required for both risk analysis and  
site design for major events. We can define these as the basic skills required  
for an event planner and the license/approval authority.  
Missing skills  
Over many years of teaching the basic principles and applications of crowd  
modelling, we have noted that the basics are poorly \(if at all\) understood.  
Mathematical skills, such as being able to calculate area and density, were  
very low across the industry. That appeared to be at the core of the prob-  
lem; the relevant skill set required to conduct an adequate risk assessment  
was poor, and therefore, the risk assessment was inadequate. This applied  
to both the planning and approval phases of the event process.  
To address this missing skill set, we developed a range of simple model-  
ling tools that not only helped delegates at our workshops understand crowd  
space requirements, but also provided a much more rigorous approach to  
risk analysis. From the workshops, expert witness cases we have been  
involved with, and the many tales of near misses, one thing was clear; in  
all cases, the basic skills of risk assessment were poor or altogether lacking.  
Basics  
As previously stated, in our research and teaching, we have found a lack of  
awareness of the basic skills \(key competencies\) relating to event planning  
and event approval/licensing/permitting and risk assessment. These basic  
skills are as follows\:  
1\. Understanding the standing crowd density limits  
2\. Understanding the moving crowd density limits  
3\. Understanding crowd risks associated with standing and moving  
crowd density  
4\. Understanding areas within the site that are static \(standing crowds in  
those areas\) and dynamic \(moving crowds in those areas\)  
5\. Understanding crowd flow rates, throughput rates and fill rates  
6\. Understanding the risks associated with high/low flow rates in com-  
plex spaces  
To perform an adequate risk assessment with specific focus on the crowd  
dynamic, we have found that once the basic elements of understanding and  
application are outlined, typically over 2 days, the delegates can apply these  
principles to any event, large or small. The key to this is building a solid,  
visual image of the risks in complex and dynamic environments. We take  
the delegates through that process. 32 Introduction to crowd science  
UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC SKILLS  
In this section, we will demonstrate how to calculate and assess crowd density.  
From first principles, we will demonstrate how to calculate and assess crowd  
flow and throughput, and hence how to assess overcrowding and crushing  
risks. We will then examine historical incidents using this technique, to illus-  
trate how—if these basic skills had been applied ­ correctly—the risks could  
have been foreseen, anticipated and hence incidents prevented. We outline  
how to apply these techniques for future events and how to define a more  
appropriate technique for crowd risk assessment in order to improve crowd  
safety. The first of these is the calculation of the standing crowd density.  
How much space do crowds need?  
The key to understanding the space requirement for a crowd lies in under-  
standing how much space is required for each person. This sounds simple,  
but there is a problem\: some documents refer to density \(people per square  
metre\) and others refer to the area per person \(which is the inverse of den-  
sity\). This confusion needs to be both highlighted and avoided.  
Why is this a problem?  
Density values \(people per square metre\) are easier to visualise than its  
inverse \(area per person\). Here is a simple experiment to illustrate this point\:  
consider how much space there is around you right now. That is your area  
per person. Now try and estimate that area. As you can see, it is not easy to  
make a quick estimate of your area per person—especially if there are other  
people around you. Now think of 1 square metre, marked on the floor, and  
two people standing in that box. This is two people per square metre; the  
same density as 0.5 square metres per person. The people per square metre  
value—is easier to visualise than the area per person. We have also found  
that when delegates were asked to explain, say, 0.3 square metres per person  
as a density, they struggled to both visualise and express this as a density.  
Engineers and mathematicians have no difficulty in understanding that  
the area per person is the inverse of density; the problem is that crowd man-  
agers are neither engineers nor mathematicians. We keep it simple—density,  
people per square metre, is easier to understand.  
Standing and moving space requirements  
A person standing at an event occupies a certain area \(floor space\). A mov-  
ing person occupies a larger area, as they need to extend their limbs to  
walk. This should be intuitively obvious. We need to understand both the  
standing and the moving space requirements in order to evaluate whether Crowd risk analysis 33  
the design of a system can accommodate the crowd. Within the event, there  
will be areas that the crowd will be predominantly static \(standing\) and  
other areas where there will be a lot of potential movement \(dynamic\).  
These two areas need to be assessed differently.  
This provides us with the basic definitions for crowd risks in the event  
space\: the static and the dynamic risks. The space \(static or dynamic\) is  
either sufficient for the crowd’s needs or there is a risk of overcrowding  
and subsequent injury. This needs to be the first consideration in the event  
planning and approval phases. Is there sufficient space for the crowd? Is the  
space fit for the purpose?  
If not, there are risks to the crowd, and these risks need to be managed  
in order to prevent accident or injury. Although this sounds trivial, the real-  
ity is that many crowd risks are poorly understood, neglected or ignored.  
The fundamental principles of crowd space requirements, crowd throughput,  
flow rates, density, ­ overcrowding, risk monitoring and risk management were  
either neglected or poorly applied in all the major disasters. For example, Love  
Parade \(Duisburg, 2010\); Hillsborough \(UK, 1989\); Mihong Park, Beijing  
\(China, 2004\) and the Jamarat Bridge \(Saudi Arabia, 1990, 1994, 1997,  
1998, 2001, 2004 and 2006\) all feature similar mismatch between the capac-  
ity \(area\) of a space and the number of people trying to move into that space.  
Hillsborough, for example, in the United Kingdom, had a wide approach  
route \(Leppings Lane\) and only a few turnstiles designated for the approach-  
ing crowd. The crowd flow exceeded the throughput \(process rate\) at the  
turnstiles. Consequently, a queue developed, and over time, this became a  
crush. To alleviate the pressure, an exit was opened and the crowds flowed  
into an area that was already overcrowded, resulting in mass fatalities.  
Love Parade \(in Germany\) had similar characteristics\: the arrival profile  
\(the rate at which crowds arrive\) exceeded the throughput of the entry sys-  
tem and the combined ingress/egress rates were predictably greater than the  
physical limit of the system, its throughput. Again a fatal crush developed.  
These incidents share similar characteristics; simple mathematical analysis  
shows the underlying failure modes of the systems, and simple mathematics  
would have proven this was the case before the accident claimed lives.  
To expand on this key point, we need to take a first-principles approach  
to defining the size of people, their spatial requirement and the required  
space for safe crowd standing and moving at events.

the principles of crowd density and then build a fundamental model of risk  
from overcrowding. From this risk analysis, we can go on to review the  
existing guidance and building codes.  
We can see that the maximum area of a person is 0.26 square metres,  
and the average is 0.20 square metres. The maximum width of a person is  
51.5 cm, the average width of a person is 46.06 cm. These area calculations  
include space around the person\: this is called the body ellipse.

The data from Bodyspace were calculated using the body ellipse, shown in  
Figure 2.1, which includes some space around a person.  
EVENT GUIDANCE  
The UK Events Guide \(similar documents exist in other countries\) indi-  
cates that the event capacity space must be calculated at two people per Crowd risk analysis 35

ward view of a standing person.  
square metre. Although this is a simple enough calculation—for example,  
to calculate event/site capacity, take the available area and multiply by  
two—it has proven to be oversimplified, and there are hidden risks in this  
oversimplification as it assumes that all spaces are used equally within  
the site.  
Standing crowd density  
To understand crowd density \(people per square metre\) and hence crowd  
risk, we use several visual aids and classroom experiments. The reason we  
developed this was twofold, the first was to provide some control room  
visuals, specifically for closed-circuit television \(CCTV\) operators, to assist  
them in visualising crowd density from a range of angles and the second  
was to assist delegates in understanding both the physical and psychologi-  
cal effects of crowd density. Over the years, these experiments have proven  
to be memorable and popular and they help delegates/students understand  
the principles of standing crowd density and risk.  
Average area for a person  
If we assume that the average area per person is 0.20 square metres \(this  
includes a little space around the person, as previously explained\), it fol-  
lows that five people could occupy approximately 1 square metre. Firstly,  
0.2 square metres per person should be converted into a density value.  
The calculation would be 1 square metre divided by 0.2 square metres  
per person, which is the equivalent of five people in 1 square metre. We  
could, in theory, accommodate five people per square metre for any given  
area; we could, in theory, take 100 square metres and fit 500 people into  
that space. They would be packed together with little space between  
them. 36 Introduction to crowd science  
We can observe events \(e.g. front of stage at a concert or along a parade  
route\) where the crowd appears to be packed at high density. In these cir-  
cumstances, the maximum density \(five people per square metre\) may seem  
reasonable. Yet, the guidance only relates to the overall site capacity and  
does not refer to high-density \(static\) spaces or lower-density \(dynamic\)  
spaces. These two types of spaces need to be risk assessed differently, and  
we need standards for assessing these risks.  
So, would maximum packing, at five people per square metre, be an  
acceptable standard? The UK Guide to Sports Grounds \(the Green Guide\)  
indicates that 47 people in 10 square metres are the maximum number of  
people for a standing crowd at a sports event. This appears to be in line  
with the international data for area per person, but there are no references  
to the shape of the space, the size of the crowd \(the number of people\) or  
the nature of the event. Subsequently, there are a number of potential hid-  
den problems in this notion of maximum packing; it assumes that everyone  
is of ‘average’ size, standing still and evenly distributed across the space.  
If we were to pack an area to this level \(five people per square metre\), the  
crowd would have to remain static. There would be very little space for any  
individual to leave a packed area. Individuals would find it difficult to move  
around the area, to get to the facilities and so on.  
If someone falls in a maximum-packed crowded space, it may be very dif-  
ficult for him or her to stand up again. It should be clear that, at the maxi-  
mum packing density of five people per square metre, the crowd would not  
be able to move freely or easily in an emergency, and so, there are risks.  
The size of the crowd, the complexity of the event, the shape of the area,  
its entry and exit points, the nature of the event, the location and capacity  
of the facilities and exit routes … all these factors need to be assessed when  
considering a maximum packing area.  
In simple terms, as crowd density increases, the ability of individuals to  
move in the crowd decreases. We can state that as crowd density \(number of  
people per square metre\) increases, there is an increasing risk to individu-  
als \(and hence to the crowd\). Increasing crowd density also decreases both  
comfort and individual mobility.  
Maximum packing \(five people per square metre\) would have some iner-  
rant risk and may be uncomfortable, depending on its location and dura-  
tion. Although it may sound obvious—that the risk of incidents increases  
as crowd density increases—there are no clear definitions of this level of  
risk.  
We regularly observe high-density crowds at the front of stage at a con-  
cert or during a parade with no incident, and that is a fundamental problem  
with the concept of risk. A risk is a situation involving exposure to danger;  
an event may pass without the incident. That does not lessen the risk, but  
it does alter the perception of risk—and this concept can be difficult to  
explain. Crowd risk analysis 37  
The toss of a coin  
Imagine you toss a coin three times, it is a fair coin—a coin that has an  
equal probability of landing on either heads or tails. Supposing the coin has  
fallen three times on heads\: what do you assume about the coin? That it is  
not fair, that it has some bias towards falling on heads, that some cheating  
has occurred or that the laws of probability now dictate that the next toss  
must be tails in order to even up the odds? \(After all, it is a fair coin.\) If we  
ask delegates to predict the next toss, they often say\: ‘Probability says it is  
more likely to come up tails next’ but they are wrong. Each toss is fair; each  
outcome \(heads or tails\) is equally likely \(50\:50\); no matter what pattern  
has occurred in the previous coin tosses, it does not, will not and cannot  
affect the next coin toss.  
This example illustrates the problem of risk and frequency of occurrence;  
if you assume that the next toss of a coin will be tails because heads have  
occurred three times in a row, you would be wrong. The result is equally  
likely to be heads or tails; each toss of the coin is independent of the last  
toss, no matter how many times the previous tosses have come up as heads.  
The reason why this principle is so important is best illustrated when we  
look at risk analysis for major events\:  
Supposing you run an event that includes a large crowd, packed at high  
density, watching a concert. Let us assume that you have compiled your  
risk assessment and taken the necessary precautions for crowd safety  
\(installed pit crews and crowd monitoring, invested in steward training and  
arranged emergency crews on standby\) and… nothing happens. There are  
no incidents.  
This does not change the underlying risks but it does change the percep-  
tion of risk—and that can have an impact on the preparedness, effort and  
budget for the safety systems for the next event. Just as the succession of  
heads in the coin toss experiment encouraged a belief that tails were bound  
to come next, a run of successful events without the incident will lead some  
operators to believe that there is less of a risk for the next event.  
This confuses the relationship between crowd density and crowd risk  
for the crowd manager or event organiser, since a risk is an underlying  
threat and not a manifestation of that threat. The next event has the same  
risks as the last event; it requires the same management effort for planning,  
the same resources and the same budget. As events are staged around the  
world, with larger and larger crowds, there is a perception that they can be  
run with less effort and less cost. When you monitor the impact a major  
disaster has on crowd safety engineering, you see a clear pattern emerging\:  
the costs of protecting the crowd have no return and no profit. The bud-  
gets become harder to fight for and justify, the standards for safety decline  
and another incident occurs. Without the key competency skills, standards  
for event planning, improvements to the guidance and licensing of major 38 Introduction to crowd science  
events and the appropriate risk analysis techniques, major incidents and  
crowd disasters are inevitable.  
DEFINING RISKS  
Applying the event guidance of two people per square metre does not clas-  
sify an event as safe. Crowds move into a site, move around a site, stand  
and watch events, queue for bars and toilets, enter and exit attractions…  
events can be very dynamic in nature.  
To understand the crowd risks, we need to understand the location, dura-  
tion and severity of potential risks to the crowd during an event. We also  
need to understand that there are two different values of crowd density, a  
static \(stationary\) value and a dynamic \(moving\) value. If we consider two  
primary states of the crowd \(standing and moving\), then we can define  
event spaces with static areas \(where the crowd will be typically standing,  
watching and observing\), and dynamic areas \(where the crowds typically  
pass through, such as entry systems\).  
Although the UK Event Guidance states the capacity should be defined  
as two people per square metre, this value is not sufficient to define a  
‘safe’ event capacity. Emergency egress capacity \(defined as the time it  
would take to evacuate the site\) may limit the site capacity and there  
are other factors such as the physical condition of the site, the security,  
the site perimeter and the nature of the crowd. In short, we need more  
information to understand, classify and mitigate potential crowd risks.  
We need to understand the time—the duration—of the crowd dynamic  
in event spaces.  
To understand these elements, and why they are important for crowd  
safety, we need to understand the two primary density values \(static  
and dynamic\) and how they relate to the crowd dynamic during events.  
Although these principles are relatively simple to explain and illustrate,  
our experience shows that a lack of basic understanding has been one  
of the primary failures \(in understanding risks\) in major incidents. The  
problem is compounded by inadequate guidance that states an oversim-  
plified value \(two people per square metre\), and this is the root of the  
problem\: two people per square metre are not sufficient to highlight  
the potential for harm at a major event. Furthermore, to argue a case  
for lack of appropriate risk analysis, space calculations, differentiating  
spaces and static/dynamic area calculations, we often hear this claim\:  
‘But the guidance states two people per square metre’, as if that value is  
the only calculation required to guarantee crowd safety. This is a naive  
and negligent approach to crowd risk analysis. However, if you read the  
relevant section in the UK Event Guidance, it implies that the minimum  
is enough! Crowd risk analysis 39  
To illustrate this point, below are extracts from event guidance from  
Australia, the UK Sports Guide and by comparison, the UK Event Guidance  
\(1999—date of publication\). The Australian Event Guidance Worksafe—  
Crowd Control at Venues and Events\: A Practical Occupational Health  
and Safety Guide \(second edition, January 2007\) states\:  
1.1 WHAT DOES THIS GUIDE AIM TO DO?  
Managing crowds involves significant risk. The extent, severity and  
exposure to risk will vary depending on\: the circumstances crowd con-  
trollers find themselves in; how well crowd control staff have been pre-

From the UK Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds \(fifth edition, 2008\)\:  
The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds is an advisory document for use  
by competent persons. It is the distillation of many years of research  
and experience of the safety management and design of sports grounds.  
The Guide has no statutory force but many of its recommendations  
will be made statutory at individual grounds by their inclusion in safety  
certificates issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 or the  
Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. \[…\] The advice given  
in this Guide is without prejudice to the application of the appropri-  
ate Building Regulations, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974,  
and any other relevant legislation. The information in this Guide is  
intended to provide useful guidance, but it is not a definitive statement 40 Introduction to crowd science  
applicable in all circumstances. Independent professional advice should  
be obtained before taking any action or refraining from taking any  
action based on this information.  
Both of the above documents point to specific legal requirements \(in  
Australia and the United Kingdom\). In contrast, the UK Event Guidance  
\(HSG 195 1999–2013\) states\:  
Following the guidance is not compulsory and you are free to take  
other action. But if you do follow the guidance you will normally be  
doing enough to comply with the law.  
At the time of publication of this book, HSG 195 was under review. The  
proposed wording reads\:  
1.5 Event organisers, concert promoters, contractors, subcontractors,  
freelancers and venue owners all have a statutory duty to comply with  
the Health and Safety at Work Act \(HSAW\).  
This obviously changes the emphasis from ‘doing enough to comply with  
the law’ to a direct reference to the Health and Safety at Work Act, which  
has been in place in the United Kingdom since 1974. This was one of the  
primary motivations for developing the crowd safety courses, and why we  
still need to define a more appropriate method of understanding crowd  
risks and legal liabilities.  
THE MINIMUM IS NOT ENOUGH  
We need to explore the space limits for both static and moving crowds, and  
to define standards and practical guidance for event planning and approval  
phases. For that, we need to define, from first principles; static and moving  
crowd density—to differentiate event spaces into either static or dynamic  
spaces. We need to define the relative risks in both spaces, and define the  
overall event dynamic. We have found that when delegates understand these  
basic principles, and can apply them in conjunction with the various guid-  
ance documents, they report that they feel better equipped to understand  
the principles of crowd risk analysis. We do not aim to replace the guidance,  
only to develop a clearer understanding of crowd risks from first principles.  
Illustration of crowd density  
We created a series of Figures 2.2 through 2.4 showing crowd density from  
one to six people per square metre. Crowd risk analysis 41  
Figure 2.2  \(a\) One person per square metre. \(b\) Two people per square metre. These  
are downward views of standing people. \(Author’s graphic.\)  
Figure 2.3  \(a\) Three people per square metre. \(b\) Four people per square metre. These  
are downward views of standing people. \(Author’s graphic.\)  
In Figures 2.2 and 2.3, the graphics show characters of 50 ×  
30 cm from  
a top-down view. The characters are standing still, and are all facing in the  
same direction and standing in the same way. The distribution of charac-  
ters is uniform \(evenly spaced\) and all characters in the graphics are exactly  
of the same size. Obviously, this is nothing like a real crowd of real people,  
but it does help visualise crowd density.  
Higher-density crowds  
At higher densities, the crowd packing obviously becomes closer, to the point  
of people being in physical contact with each other. We have illustrated this 42 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 2.4  Five and six people per square metre. These are downward views of standing  
people. \(Author’s graphic.\)  
using the same individual graphic in Figure 2.4. It should be clear that a  
standing crowd might be able to pack to high density at concerts if they are  
all facing the same direction and are packed in rows.  
Crowds are rarely this well packed or ordered. We highlight that Figure  
2.4 \(five and six people per square metre\) shows an average set of identical  
individuals, standing in exactly the same way; facing forwards and packed  
as closely as possible. We can see that although it may be possible to pack  
these many people into this space, it is not realistic. Furthermore, Figure  
2.4 gives no indication of risk or comfort within the crowd. The graphic  
is misleading; it looks possible, but it is neither practical nor desirable.  
At concerts, where free standing is allowed, the crowd may pack to even  
higher densities, where individuals are physically squeezed together and  
moving to the music.  
Freedom of choice  
In workshops and lectures, we illustrate crowd density, comfort and risk  
using the following experiment\: first, we provide delegates with cut-out  
characters and squared paper. The delegates can experiment with the cut-  
outs in different packing configurations, such as random packing, front-of-  
stage crowd packing, queuing, packed elevator, Christmas sales and so on.  
Then we mark out an area of 1 square metre on the ground. We have a  
piece of string of 4 m long, tied in a loop; we mark every metre on the string  
with a pen and simply tape the string to the marks on the floor \(in a square\).  
We then ask people to step into the square one at a time. Unlike the cut-out  
figures and graphics in this chapter, the delegates are all of different sizes  
and they stand in different postures/positions. Where there are two people Crowd risk analysis 43  
in the square, we ask them to move around and to tell us how it feels. This  
illustrates, albeit using a small area, that two people per square metre can  
safely occupy that space and move around. We then ask another person to  
step into the square; again, we ask them to move around and to describe  
how they feel. Another person is then asked to step into the square.  
With four people per square metre, there is normally enough space for a  
fifth person to walk through the group \(even with larger-framed individu-  
als\). This gives us a useful crowd indicator that can assist CCTV camera  
operators\: if we are observing a crowd, and we see people walking through  
the crowd, we know the density must be less than four people per square  
metre, and is therefore relatively at low risk.  
With five people in the square metre, we ask the individuals how this  
level of density feels and they report beginning to feel a little uncomfort-  
able. The level of discomfort will depend on many factors, such as gender  
mix, body sizes, room temperature and so on.  
Upper limit established  
With five people in the square, we ask a sixth person to try to move through  
the group, and we find that the sixth person cannot easily pass through.  
With larger-framed individuals occupying more space than others, it can  
become very uncomfortable for the person in the middle of this experi-  
mental setup. We let the group stand in position for a few minutes and ask  
them to describe, to the rest of the class, how it feels. This is a very simple  
experiment, easily set up and very low cost.  
We recommend that you, the reader, may want to replicate this simple  
experiment and draw your own interpretation of the group comments. You  
will note some interesting observations \(e.g. males and females will report  
different degrees of comfort, specifically at higher densities when bodies  
are in close contact\). This experiment gives us an indication that our physi-  
cal and psychological comfort limit appears to be at between four and five  
people per square metre. This is, of course, dependant on the individuals  
in the square metre, for example, some people can be considerably larger  
than others.  
Crowd risks  
To demonstrate risk, we tell the five people in the square that we are going  
to give the person on the corner a push. We then push that individual diago-  
nally across the group. We typically observe a shuffling movement as the  
individuals counter the push by moving their feet. From this, we can note  
that, at five people per square metre, the crowd has some resilience; it can  
absorb some pushing. 44 Introduction to crowd science  
We then ask a sixth person to step into the square, then a seventh, until  
the people in the square are physically touching, shoulder to shoulder, chest  
to back. This proximity generally occurs at around seven or eight peo-  
ple per square metre with a typical audience, but that number can vary  
depending on the individuals’ sizes. \(Note\: If you replicate the experiment,  
you may need to be tactful in selecting your target group.\)  
Shockwaves  
At six people \(or seven, depending on the sizes of the people in the square\)—  
when the individuals are surrounded on all sides and are in physical con-  
tract with each other—we repeat the push experiment. This time, we find  
the whole group moves; the person on the opposite corner is often pushed  
out of the square. As the group is packed together \(we call this ‘close pack-  
ing’\), the individuals cannot move their feet to counter the push; so, the  
energy of the push is transmitted through the crowd, like dominos fall-  
ing. We have several examples of this effect \(Love Parade, Jamarat Bridge,  
Hillsborough and various concerts\), in which we observe a wave passing  
through the crowd, gathering momentum as it progresses.  
This illustrates the nature of a specific type of high-risk situation—  
namely that at high density \(six or seven people per square metre\), a small  
push can transmit through the crowd. This is called a compression wave—  
or shockwave—and only occurs when the crowd density is such that there  
is no space between individuals. Over the years, we have seen many com-  
plex explanations, formulae, video-processing system, papers, models and  
simulations that relate to the detection of shockwaves in crowds. It is an  
interesting research, but it misses the key concept of crowd safety. Our  
classroom experiment illustrates the point clearly and simply.  
Shockwaves are dangerous; people can \(and do\) get hurt. In the Love  
Parade disaster \(and others\), there is clear evidence of shockwaves prior  
to the mass fatalities. By the time these shockwaves would be detected, by  
video processing or otherwise, it would be too late to prevent serious harm.  
As the primary objective of crowd safety engineering is to understand and  
minimise risks, it follows that we should act to prevent the shockwave  
occurring in the first place.  
KEEP THE CROWD DENSITY LOW  
It should be obvious that the shockwave can be prevented if the crowd  
density is kept lower than six or seven people per square metre. To focus  
on the detection of shockwaves is to fail to understand the nature of crowd  
density, crowd flow and crowd safety at its most fundamental level. We  
have always found it curious that research and video detection systems for Crowd risk analysis 45  
high-density crowds enter the literature as ‘safety systems’. The objective is  
to prevent shockwaves—not to measure, monitor or predict them, but to  
prevent them from occurring.  
Do we need to understand the physics of the crowd shockwave? There  
is some value to this research, but as shockwaves can only occur in high-  
density crowds, controlling crowd flow and crowd density prevents these  
dangerous phenomena from occurring in the first place. Regardless of  
the results of the scientific study and modelling of shockwaves, the UK  
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds \(2008\) guidance documents suggest  
‘no more than 47 people in 10 square metres’ for a standing crowd, and  
‘no more than four people per square metre for a moving crowd’. By  
adhering to the guidance, this crowd manager would prevent the risk of  
shockwaves.  
Average individuals  
The average-sized individual in our graphics \(Figure 2.4\) still had some space  
at six people per square metre. It is important to highlight the problem with  
the concept of an ‘average-sized’ person\: in the illustrations, and in many  
computer simulations, the ‘average’ is not a realistic representation of the  
individuals that form a crowd. People come in all shapes and sizes; our simple  
classroom example of crowd density, using a piece of string, illustrates the  
basic limits of density, comfort and risk. As we increase the crowd density  
above five people per square metre, the crowds become packed and are sus-  
ceptible to shockwaves. The risk of personal injury dramatically increases at  
high density.  
Guidance\: Single values  
The difficulty comes in trying to define safety limits as a single number for  
all crowds and all spaces within an event with no differentiation between  
static and dynamic spaces. The UK Guide to Sports Grounds \(the Green  
Guide\) indicates 47 people per 10 square metres as the upper limit for  
crowd density \(4.7 people per square metre\). This is less than the limit we  
established in our classroom experiment, which was five people per square  
metre, but it is always difficult to find that 0.7 person! Of course, these  
values are entirely dependent on the size of the individuals. ‘Five people per  
square metre for a standing/static crowd, assuming they are all of reason-  
able size’. This may not, of course, fit the description of all crowds attend-  
ing all events; the presence of backpacks, family groups, picnics and so on,  
can affect the space occupied by the crowd. These factors, and the ever-  
increasing body mass index of the Western population, suggest the figures  
in the demographic table \(Table 2.1\) and may need to be reconsidered with  
regard to certain countries and certain events. 46 Introduction to crowd science  
Control density to reduce risks  
Obviously, at lower densities, the shockwaves simply do not propagate; we  
can state that increasing crowd density beyond five people per square metre  
will increase the risk of shockwaves. We can also state that the shockwave  
potential \(or susceptibility\) begins when there is no space between individu-  
als in a crowd of between six and seven people per square metre. At this  
density, a static crowd is susceptible to risk of serious harm. Simply put, if  
you keep the static crowd density to five people per square metre or less,  
you can prevent shockwaves. This is so fundamental to crowd risk analysis  
and safety engineering that it needs to be writ large. The upper limit to  
crowd density is defined for a good reason\: it prevents the risk of shock-  
waves. Why this is not stated in guidance or in scientific literature is not  
clear. We also need a different value for a moving crowd; we will review  
that later in this chapter.  
Calculating area\: A problem  
To control crowd density, the operator must know the event areas. He or  
she must understand how they are used and whether they are static or  
dynamic spaces. This leads us to an interesting problem we found with  
many delegates; they found it difficult to understand the calculation of  
area.  
Density is measured as people per square metre. Over the years, we have  
asked a wide range of practitioners, ‘What are 10 square metres’? It may  
come as a surprise that many reply, ‘10 metres by 10 metres’. This gives  
us some insight into the need for going back to the very basics of area and  
density analysis for static and moving crowds. It is difficult to visualise an  
area of 47 people per 10 square metres \(as per UK Guide to Safety at Sports  
Grounds, 2008\), and hence, mistakes are often made in calculating crowd  
density limits.  
One square metre is easy to visualise\: it is a box measuring 1 by 1 m.  
We can visualise two, three, four or more people standing in that box,  
and that is a good visual reference for crowd density. Larger areas start  
to become more difficult to visualise. If you think 10 square metres is a  
square measuring 10 by 10 m, you will be visualising 100 square metres—  
not 10 square metres. Ten square metres are 5 by 2 m \(5  
×  
2  
=  
10\). This  
may seem obvious to the reader, but we have found this is a fundamental  
problem with delegates in the workshops.  
Events are rarely held in perfect square or rectangular areas; areas can be  
difficult to calculate. Since area calculations determine the crowd capacity,  
an area error will lead to an event capacity error and this may lead to an  
increased crowd density, which means increased risk. Event spaces need to  
be individually assessed for their usage during an event. Crowd risk analysis 47  
Two types of space  
An event area can be broken into two different types of space\: those where  
the crowd is typically standing, and those where it is typically moving.  
The maximum density is different for these two spaces. For static spaces,  
we have established that five people per square metre are an upper limit, a  
maximum for comfort, and that this applies to a crowd without backpacks,  
of average, uniform size, etc. Again, we stress that guidance does not dif-  
ferentiate these two classes of space and only refers to one value, which is  
two people per square metre. So we need to break the event space into at  
least two types of space, static and dynamic. First, we need to estimate the  
overall area.  
When we ask delegates to estimate both crowd density and event areas  
using a wide range of photographs, maps, plans and diagrams, we often  
get a wide range of answers. Most delegates—and these are typically peo-  
ple with crowd management experience—over- or underestimate area and  
crowd numbers. In several examples, we have noted that crowd numbers  
grossly inflated by a factor of 10 \(1,000,000 people, where the correct num-  
ber was 100,000\).  
This is a fundamental calculation error, and the one we see repeated  
around the world; this kind of error increases the chance of incidents due to  
overcrowding. To illustrate the point\: one of our former projects involved  
working on a major event where the crowd numbers were originally esti-  
mated at 250,000 people viewing along a route. After working with the  
client and measuring all the available viewing areas, the realistic estimate  
proved to be 50,000 people viewing along that route.  
This illustrates the common failures in event planning\: failure to esti-  
mate the areas correctly, failure to estimate the safe capacity and failure to  
understand the space requirements for both standing and moving crowds.  
It is essential that we develop clearer, simpler methods for area and capac-  
ity analysis.  
A BIGGER PICTURE  
Reference graphics are a good way of analysing area and capacity analysis.  
To illustrate a large crowd, we produced a range of images of randomly  
distributed crowds, pictured over two tennis courts to provide a reference  
dimension. The following series of Figures 2.5 and 2.6 show 625 square  
metres \(25 by 25 m\).  
To calculate the area of a square or rectangle, you multiply the length  
by the breadth. Non-rectangular shapes have different area calculations.  
There are a number of potential pitfalls where the area for crowds is con-  
cerned; for example, the area of a circle of 1 square metre would have a 48 Introduction to crowd science

perimeter \(circumference\) of 3.54 m where a square metre would have a

Figures 2.7 and 2.8 show three and four people per square metre add  
in the 625 square metre area. It should be clear that it is not possible to  
count the exact number of people by hand, or to assess it easily by the eye Crowd risk analysis 49

\(the modelling system produces the crowd density input by the user\). This  
highlights an operational issue for larger crowds, in that it can be difficult to  
reasonably estimate the numbers of people in any given space, as you can see  
from Figures 2.7 and 2.8. We often use these types of graphics in the control  
room to provide visual aids to assist in crowd density and crowd numbers. 50 Introduction to crowd science  
Two people per square metre  
As we can see from the graphics \(Figures 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8\), it is difficult to  
estimate crowd numbers. The problem is compounded when viewing this  
type of crowd via CCTV \(closed circuit television\) in a control room. Figure  
2.9 shows the crowd in 625 square metres at a density of five people per  
square metre. It appears that the density is higher towards the top of the dia-  
gram; this is an illusion, due to the angle of the camera as it looks towards  
the crowd. The density is in fact even throughout. This illusion has conse-  
quences for event management\: angles and lines of sight can be misleading.  
Density perspective illusion  
The importance of modelling cannot be overemphasised. In Figure 2.9, we  
see what appears to be a density gradient \(higher density towards the top  
of the image\). There is no gradient; it is only the illusion of the perspec-  
tive from the angle of the camera position in our virtual environment. This  
picture illustrates the problem a crowd manager has during an event; the  
inexperienced operator can make incorrect assumptions of crowd density  
based on poor understanding of key lines of sight—it is one of the problems  
relating to over- or underestimation of crowd numbers.  
To illustrate this point, let us consider a ticketed concert/event that has a  
total capacity of 10,000 people, based on 5000 square metres at two people  
per square metre. We would argue that this is over simplistic and that it  
fails to address the key areas of crowd risks. For example, if all 10,000  
Figure 2.9  Five people per square metre \(3125 people in 25  
×  
25 m  
=  
625 square metres\).

crowd packing in complex spaces. \(Author’s graphic.\) Crowd risk analysis 51  
people want to be as close as possible to the front of stage, crushing/shock-  
waves may develop. This would be at high risk, even though it would still  
comply with the ‘two people per square metre’ capacity guidance.  
Space filling  
Static crowd density can be impacted by the manner in which space fills. If,  
for example, a crowd rushes towards the front of stage when gates open,  
they will pack more tightly than a slower-moving crowd. Crowd movement  
during entry can alter the risk of shockwaves during an event, and its analy-  
sis should feature as part of the best practices for event management. It can  
become labour intensive where lines of stewards may need to control entry  
rush for a more popular performer and a more excitable crowd, but it has  
a significant safety impact on the pressure at the front of stage during the  
performance. To understand this, we need to understand the space require-  
ments of a moving crowd and develop a better understanding of the ways in  
which crowds fill spaces.  
Moving crowds  
The profile \(downward view\) of a person walking is going to be larger than  
that of a person standing. Figures 2.10 through 2.13 illustrate a typical  
walking profile.  
This is a sequence of images illustrating the typical space used when  
arms and legs move during normal, unimpeded walking. We can use the  
Figure 2.10  Walker sequence 1—downward view of a person walking, image from  
commercial software. \(Poser—commercial software, image created by the

largest profile \(downward view\) of the man walking \(Figure 2.13\), as the  
maximum spatial requirement for an average-sized person walking. We can  
then compare this to the standing crowd profile. This would allow us to  
represent the extent of space an individual requires for normal, unrestricted  
walking alongside the image of the standing crowd. We can then compare

different densities against the standing and walking characters to develop  
a clearer understanding of the two crowd states for an event space \(static  
and dynamic areas\).  
Sounds too simple!  
Basic information can assist in the planning of an event. The problem is  
that the guidance for events does not cover the basics; it does not build up  
these key-learning points or support the fundamental elements to build a  
case for crowd risk analysis. The industry is, as previously stated, minimum  
cost, minimum wage, with a high staff turnover. So, to support the case for  
crowd and event risk analysis in relation to static and dynamic space, we  
need to go back to the first-principle analysis and build up the picture using  
simple tools—the tools we have developed over a decade of researching,  
advising and teaching. These tools have proven, repeatedly, to provide vital  
insight into the nature of risk and the crowd dynamic at minimum cost to  
the event process.  
Once the basic principles of individual static and dynamic space require-  
ments are understood, the development of a more detailed flow model has  
both context and application. From that, we can build a clearer under-  
standing of the crowd risks across events and in the built and complex  
environment.  
An important point we have come to understand—and to develop bet-  
ter teaching methods for—is the nature of crowd flow and how it relates 54 Introduction to crowd science  
to individual speeds. In other words, the time it takes areas to reach crush  
density. The overall flow–density relationship is vital in understanding risks  
in crowded spaces. First, we need to illustrate crowd density for a moving  
crowd.  
Standing and walking profiles\: Another string  
experiment  
Figures 2.14 through 2.16 show one, two and three people per square  
metre, both standing \(on the left\) and walking \(on the right\).  
These graphics are again artificial in that we have set an even density  
\(space between characters\) and allocated the maximum space between  
Figure 2.14  One person per square metre standing and walking. \(Author’s graphic.\)  
Figure 2.15  Two people per square metre standing and walking. \(Author’s graphic.\) Crowd risk analysis 55  
Figure 2.16  Three people per square metre standing and walking. \(Author’s graphic.\)  
the walking characters, who are all marching in a perfect step. This serves  
to illustrate the definitions of space required for standing and moving  
crowds.  
We illustrated static/standing density in the classroom using volunteers  
and a 4-m length of string laid out on the floor in a 1-m square; this  
gave us some insight into the nature, influences and risks associated with  
standing crowds and shockwaves. The moving/dynamic crowd requires  
more space. To understand the moving crowd space requirements, the  
potential for risk to the moving crowd and the comfort factors for the  
individuals in the crowd, we use another string experiment—this time  
with people walking.  
The string needs to be 3.54 m long, which is an area of 1 square metre  
\(an approximation for the purposes of this experiment\), and tied in a loop.  
We put a person inside the loop and ask them to walk 10 paces forwards;  
then we put a second person in the loop and ask both to walk 10 paces  
forwards. For one and two people per square metre \(see Figure 2.17\), there  
is no impediment to normal walking, providing the two individuals possess  
approximately the same build and level of mobility. When we put a third  
person into the loop, the only way the three can walk normally is to stand  
side by side. A fourth person in the loop means the subjects can only be  
arranged in a two-by-two configuration, and they start to experience diffi-  
culty in walking. A fifth person in the loop reduces movement dramatically  
\(to a slow shuffling\).  
We then ask the five people in the loop to march in a step. There is  
an increase in the speed of movement, but not up to the normal pace.  
Introducing a sixth person reduces the movement to a very slow shuffling.  
We have videoed this experiment for educational purposes \(http\://www.

We stress that this experiment only illustrates the principles of how den-  
sity and crowd movement are related. We can derive a simple graph of  
crowd density and crowd flow—illustrated at the end of this section. This  
is an important teaching point that helps to build a clearer understanding  
of both the function of density and crowd flow, along with the experience  
of crowd density in a controlled environment.  
In Figure 2.18, we can see three people per square metre, in the string loop,  
walking side by side, unimpeded and in relative comfort. In Figure 2.19, we

see four people per square metre and the movement becomes difficult; the  
individuals are in a closer packing configuration.  
As with the standing experiment, we add another person to the group to  
assess the effect of density, asking the group how it feels, and we time their  
progress walking over a measured distance.  
At five people per square metre, the movement is severely restricted, and,  
as you can see in Figure 2.20, the group is packed together. Unlike in the

Figure 2.21  Six people per square metre walking experiment. \(Author’s photograph.\)  
standing experiment, the group cannot spread out to the corners. This  
experiment illustrates the dynamics of a constrained crowd.  
At six people per square metre, movement is very slow and awkward  
\(Figure 2.21\). The subjects typically describe this level of density as uncom-  
fortable and unsafe, as they have no real control over their balance.  
GRAPHING THE RESULTS  
The two string experiments demonstrate risk and comfort in relation to  
crowd density. These simple classroom exercises provide us with both  
the physical experience of crowd density and the insight into the nature  
of standing and moving crowd space requirements. To provide further  
insight into crowd flow, we time the dynamic group walking over 20 m and  
note that as the density increases above three people per square metre, the  
crowd’s speed of movement drops dramatically.  
Figure 2.22 shows the relationship between crowd density \(people per  
square metre\) and crowd flow \(people per metre per minute\). From this,  
we can see that as crowd density increases above three people per square  
metre, the flow rate \(number of people past a specific point per minute\)  
drops. So, the congestion, efficiency and rate of passage will become dif-  
ficult above the threshold value. At the guidance value of four people per  
square metre, as we observe in the string experiment, the crowd is at its Crowd risk analysis 59

maximum packing density. With five people per square metre, movement is  
difficult, and increases the potential risk of trips, slips and falls.  
Nothing new  
The graph is not ground breaking. The relationship between crowd flow  
and crowd density has been published in many different forms for many  
years, from Fruin’s original thesis in 1971 and the subsequent papers; inter-  
national guidance \(such as the USA Highways Capacity Manual, which  
outlines pedestrian movements in places of public assembly\) and with  
guidance for transportation system designs \(e.g. railway transit systems\).  
Berlonghi\* describes the effects of high density as follows\:  
A dense crowd is one in which individual physical movement is rap-  
idly becoming less likely or possible due to the density of the crowd.  
People are attempting to move but they are either swept along with the  
movement of the crowd or are falling on top of each other. The results  
of this compression of people are fatalities and serious injuries due to  
suffocation.

Doomed to repeat past mistakes  
We have asked many delegates over the years whether they were aware of  
the above references \(Fruin, Berlonghi et al.\). The answer is generally ‘No’,  
and the reason for this is that the text, although widely available, is not  
widely read or understood, too technical, not required reading, not part of  
the job specification. The message should be clear; mistakes at major events  
are doomed to be repeated unless this material becomes both understood  
and applied.  
Site design  
To control entry to an event, we would erect some sort of barrier or fence  
around the site. The crowd needs to enter the space \(typically by gates or  
ticket-checking system\) and leave by the same \(or different\) points in the  
system after the event has finished. It may not be immediately obvious,  
but the entry and exit points will be of limited throughput, and they need  
to be of sufficient capacity \(throughput\) to minimise the risk of crushing  
on entry or exit. These entry/exit points dictate the rate of fill, and if the  
high-density areas fill too quickly, shockwaves develop and the situation  
becomes high risk.  
Space utilisation  
An important feature of crowd density and risk assessment is evaluating  
which areas within the space will be of high density and which areas will be  
of lower density\: which areas are predominately going to be standing and  
static, and which areas are going to be dynamic. For example, entry and exit  
systems would be predominately of higher density during ingress and egress,  
but low density at other times. As an area \(say the front of stage\) fills with  
people, the crowd is unlikely to be evenly distributed around the site. There  
will be a higher density of people nearest to the point where the performers  
are expected on stage, and the density will decrease further away from the  
stage barriers. This can make it difficult to estimate the point at which the  
space is reaching its capacity limit, as the packing density will have a range  
of values. This is why it is important to monitor the crowds moving into  
these spaces.  
We know that before the crowd reaches close packing \(six or seven  
people per square metre\), we can see spaces between people \(with a good  
downward CCTV angle\), but this is not always a practical solution to con-  
trolling crowd density, there may not be time to react between the crowd  
entering the space and the space becoming too crowded. Monitoring and  
managing crowd flow and crowd build up \(density\) is essential for crowd  
safety. Crowd risk analysis 61  
BETTER REFERENCES  
We can develop a better method of assessing crowd density and event capac-  
ity, and a clearer understanding of the rates at which spaces can fill with  
training and practise. This is vital in order to understand and avoid dan-  
gerous overcrowding. To do that, we need some basic information about  
the space a moving crowd occupies, the rates at which crowds can move  
and the rates at which spaces can fill. One solution has been to use crowd  
simulations. As we outlined in the previous chapter, this method is used for  
some major events.  
DANGEROUS CROWD SIMULATIONS  
Although movement is possible at six people per square metre, it is nei-  
ther desirable nor safe. Although this may seem obvious, many computer  
simulations display crowd movement at this density—or even higher. As  
evidenced in our string experiments, a packing density of six people per  
square metre carries significant personal risk due to shockwaves. It would  
seem an obvious safety oversight to have a computer simulation operating  
and demonstrating safe passage at such high density, and yet, we have seen  
many such simulation outputs presented as a safety case.  
Crowd density, as defined in safety guidance, should not exceed four  
people per square metre for moving/dynamic areas \(queues, slow-moving  
crowds\), and should not exceed 4.7 people per square metre for standing/  
static areas. A crowd simulation that displays high-density crowd move-  
ment, without highlighting the significant risk to life and limb, is both mis-  
leading and potentially dangerous.  
DEFINING ‘RISK’ DUE TO DENSITY  
The question we need to ask is\: ‘What are the risks associated with crowd  
density’? If we translate the previous images and string experiments into  
a graph, we can develop a template for risks to both static and moving  
crowds \(see Figure 2.23\).  
Using the string experiments, we can demonstrate that the shockwave for  
a static crowd becomes dangerous at densities greater than five people per  
square metre, and that a moving crowd becomes unstable above three peo-  
ple per square metre. Planning an event, a site design, to maintain crowd  
density below these levels will reduce the risk. This may sound trivial when  
explained in black and white, but an examination of the fundamental  
points of failure of major crowd disasters has shown that these basics were  
poorly understood and not implemented in practice. 62 Introduction to crowd science

Conventional risk assessment  
A risk assessment is typically presented in a format similar to that shown  
in Figure 2.24, in which a list of risks—often unstructured—is described, a  
likelihood and consequence value assigned, and an overall score attributed.  
Figure 2.24  Typical risk assessment tabular format. \(From one of the author event plans,  
fuzzed to remove specific details.\) Crowd risk analysis 63  
In Chapter 1, we described the unstructured nature of this type of list  
induces an unstructured approach to the problem of risk assessment. Risk  
assessment can be highly subjective; one person’s assessment can vary to  
another person’s assessment of the same risk. This process is fraught with  
potential for misinterpretation for two reasons\: the first is that crowd risks  
are dynamic in nature and one number may not be sufficient to designate  
the risk; the second is that the risk assessment process—a list—does not  
lend itself to description and hence understanding of the dynamic nature  
of events.  
Risk is dynamic; crowd risks can change over time. They are dependent on  
a number of factors and on a number of external influences. Understanding  
how risks change with time is fundamental to the development of a robust  
crowd management plan.  
Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis  
The existing risk-analysis process can be described as quantitative\: a pro-  
cess in which a risk is identified and a value is assigned to that risk. As  
crowd risks are dynamic in nature, they do not lend themselves to this kind  
of over simplification. We can apply a qualitative risk-mapping process to  
assist in identifying the time, location and relative severity of a risk. To  
understand this process, imagine a site that is about to open, where the  
crowds are queuing outside the event. The crowd risks are now located in a  
specific space \(the entry points\) and during a particular time period \(prior  
to gates opening\), and it may be anticipated that the crowds will cover a  
specific area—which would be based on the number of people expected at  
the event—while queuing.  
This is very simple to illustrate on a map. It shows the location of the  
risk, the size of the crowd, the relative risk \(we typically suggest red/orange/  
green to indicate these types of risk\) and the time of the risk. If a series of  
maps/diagrams are produced for different times during an event, we can see  
that the risks move around the site, appear at specific locations and times  
and for different durations. We recommend drawing several diagrams that  
represent the site at different times, thereby highlighting crowd risks in  
key areas and at key times. This will make it easier for event organisers to  
focus resources on the monitoring or management of these risks. This is a  
qualitative risk-mapping process, as we are visualising the location, dura-  
tion and area of potential crowd risks. It assists in communicating risk  
to all parties associated with the event planning, approval and operation  
processes. Chapter 3

INTRODUCTION  
In this chapter, we examine causality of crowd-related incidents with spe-  
cific focus on reasonably foreseeable crowd risks for planned events. In  
expert witness cases, we would initially be asked these questions\: ‘was the  
incident reasonably foreseeable?’ and ‘at what point in time could the inci-  
dent have been avoided/averted?’.  
As we defined in the opening chapters of this book, the event process  
can be split into three distinct phases, planning, approval and operations.  
To answer the aforementioned questions, we need to review the concept  
of ‘reasonably foreseeable’ in the context of a layperson, an adequately  
trained crowd manager, a licensing officer/inspector and an expert. Then  
we need to review the question of averting the incident. Clearly, if the risks  
are identified during the planning and/or approval phase, and are either  
designed out of the system, or managed appropriately, then the risk may  
never materialise during the event. As an expert witness for major inci-  
dents, this is a key part of accident analysis as it identifies core competency  
and/or negligence during the planning and/or approval \(licensing\) process.  
To make crowd risk analysis more accessible to the layperson, we have  
tried to review the concepts of causality in the context of ‘reasonably fore-  
seeable’ as they would relate to crowd incidents. Our intention is not to  
65 66 Introduction to crowd science  
challenge the legal definitions, but to provide a framework, in the specific  
case of crowd incidents, of those moments in time when the incident could  
have been avoided. For this purpose, we have defined ‘distal’ and ‘proxi-  
mate’ causality in the context of planning, approval and operations of an  
event.  
Crowd disasters  
During the PhD research, we developed an incident database and began to  
categorise major crowd disasters \(excluding terrorist or structural collapse  
incidents\) to see whether there were patterns of failure.  
Notes on incidents  
In Table 3.1, we have defined, in the broadest of terms, the characteristics  
of some of the incidents over the last 25 years. A more complete form of  
these incidents appears in the appendix. Some terms may not be familiar  
to the reader, such as ‘crazing’—a term used to describe a situation where  
a crowd has been excited by particular circumstances, such as a celebrity  
appearance or a marketing promotion—where the excitement in the crowd  
is a function of media influence. ‘Hand-outs’ refers to items distributed to  
the crowd, creating a sudden interest and a subsequent crowd surge. While  
classifying these incidents, we found that they fell into three main headings\:  
design-, information- and management-related issues. Before we address  
the specific underlying attributes of crowd incidents, we need to review the  
event process and the definitions of causality.  
PLANNING, APPROVAL, OPERATIONS  
There are two types of events\: planned and unplanned. Unplanned events—  
such as spontaneous gatherings, flash mobs, riots, protests, civil disorders  
and the like—are not the subject of this book. Unplanned events are reac-  
tive in nature, and problems during these events fall into a category that  
can be defined as public order issues. Although some of the techniques  
described in this book are applicable to certain unplanned events in specific  
locations \(e.g. as desktop planning exercises in advance of known problem  
gatherings\), we will focus on planned events.  
As described in Chapter 1, planned events have three distinct phases\: the  
initial planning phase, the event approval \(licensing or permitting\) phase  
and the event operations phase. Here we will outline the issues of predict-  
able crowd risk, the analysis of event sites and the development of crowd  
management plans; specifically, we will focus on ways of improving crowd  
safety. Causality 67

Planned events  
Major events, such as citywide events, concerts, festivals and the like,  
require a significant amount of planning. This process may engage a wide  
range of partners, such as the emergency services, local authorities, build-  
ing control, licensing, promoters, contractors, landowners and performers.  
It is the responsibility of the event organiser to develop and submit an event  
plan to a licensing \(or permitting\) authority.  
In the United Kingdom an event plan is typically subject to a review pro-  
cess, often by an independent safety advisory group. Expert safety advisors  
may also be engaged to assess and advise on whether the event plan and  
safety concepts are ‘fit for purpose’.\*  
An approving authority—for example, a licensing authority in the United  
Kingdom, or a permitting authority in the United States—will then review  
the plan so that the event may be granted a licence/permit to proceed.  
For both of these critical phases \(planning and approval\) a competent  
person must compile the risk analysis, and an equally competent person  
must check it. Careful review of the risk analysis is critical; any risks  
missed during the planning process must be identified. If both planning  
and approval phases neglect risk assessment, risks may be realised during  
the operational phase of the event.  
Crowd risk analysis should include the necessary examination of spaces  
for both static \(standing\) and dynamic \(moving\) crowds. These are spaces  
such as queuing systems, entry points, exit points, emergency access and  
egress systems, connecting corridors, tunnels, turnstiles, front of stage,  
bars, concourses and the like.  
\*  
In this context, the term ‘fit for purpose’ means all parties are confident that the plan will  
work. 70 Introduction to crowd science  
For many large events, there also needs to be crowd monitoring and  
continual risk assessment during the operational phase of the event—for  
example, assessment of crowd flow rates \(dynamic spaces\) for congestion  
during queuing, at entry points, turnstile operation; congestion in critical  
locations, and whether the system is performing as planned. We would  
define this as a dynamic risk assessment and risk management process.  
Historical review  
If we review the list of incidents and accidents from around the world, we  
see an underlying theme that is common to several major incidents, pointing  
towards deficient planning and approval before events and unsatisfactory  
risk management during events. In other words, there are common causes to  
major incidents that should be recognised during planning and/or approval  
phases of the event process. We will focus in this book on these elements\:  
planning, approval, operational risk analysis and risk management. Our  
aim is to classify accidents and incidents, to identify and document the key  
points of failure, and to provide methodologies that will improve crowd risk  
analysis and safety engineering for places of public assembly. It is worth not-  
ing that of these elements, only one is truly independent of the others; plan-  
ning and event, submitting the initial documents and risk assessment, and  
managing or subcontracting the event operations are generally undertaken  
by those with event profit in mind, while approval is generally undertaken  
by authorities with no interest in the overall profit of the event, and hence  
independent of the financial drivers for the events success.  
Patterns of failure  
Major incidents are often misreported in the media in emotive headlines  
that use phrases such a ‘crowd stampede’, ‘panic’ and ‘riot’. This type of  
language implies that the crowd was at fault. However, when you examine  
the failures of each incident, a different picture emerges. The most common  
element of failure we encountered when reviewing the incident database  
was the fact that design capacity and throughput limits were exceeded. In  
many cases they were unchecked or unknown before the event, and the  
result of exceeding these limits was overcrowding. There were too many  
people and there was not enough space. This resulted in serious risk to life  
and limb, crowd crushing, injuries and mass fatalities.  
Design capacity and throughput should be understood and risk assessed  
during the planning, review and approval phases of an event. Neglect of  
this process is an underlying \(distal\) failure; to carry out the process and  
then neglect the management of the risks that have been identified is an  
operational \(proximate\) failure. This occurs during the event. The crowd is  
rarely, if ever, the actual cause of the incident. Causality 71  
CAUSALITY  
Causality is a very complex legal question; our aim is not to challenge legal  
outcomes, but to try to understand, classify and define the elements that  
have given rise to major incidents and mass fatalities in crowd-related cases,  
and to prevent history repeating itself. The aim here is to learn from past  
incidents and to improve best practices in the crowd management and event  
planning processes.  
To understand the context of causality, we have outlined some basic defi-  
nitions, taken from a range of sources. We use these definitions to clarify  
the discussion points in the context of crowd risk analysis in this book.  
Definitions  
Our focus is on the crowd dynamic. We excluded from our analysis inci-  
dents that are governed by engineering standards \(such as collapsing struc-  
tures\), criminal and terrorist activities, fires and natural disasters. We also  
excluded spontaneous \(unplanned\) events, for reasons given at the begin-  
ning of this chapter. We focussed on the areas where reasonable foreseeable  
risks could be predicted during the planning and approval phases of the  
event process, and where there may be negligence, incompetence and hence  
a direct link to an identified ­ causality associated with the crowd accidents  
or incidents. We outline where crowd risk analysis and safety engineering  
need to be introduced in order to prevent future problems.  
Causation\: Comparing scientific and legal definitions  
There are many similarities between a scientific and a legal definition of  
causation. Both attempt to provide a reasoned process with the objective of  
determining the underlying causality of observed phenomena. The major  
distinction between the scientific and legal definitions lies in the concept of  
certainty.\* The legal concept of causation is deterministic\: it is an expres-  
sion of certainty as an absolute concept. The scientific concept of causation  
is probabilistic\: it is an expression of truth.  
Risk and certainty  
Most major events run without serious incidents. We know from years  
of working in the industry that there are many unreported near misses  
and that narrow escapes are seldom published to a wider audience. There  
are numerous published materials on crowd risks, including accident and  
incident reports, court cases and public enquiries, and histories of major  
\*

incidents. High-density crowd risks are not recent—or unknown—phe-  
nomena. From this, we can assert that the information relevant to crowd  
risks is readily available for the practitioner, but only for those incidents  
that have failed and have been correctly identified and duly reported.  
Furthermore, the existence of a crowd risk does not mean it is certain to  
occur, but it does identify the outcome should it happen to occur. Crowd  
risks can be difficult to understand, they can be dynamic, have changing  
values. Crowd risks can have a relationship to the numbers of people and  
the time/duration of the event. For example, imagine a four-metre-wide  
corridor leading to a two-metre-wide door. We can say, with certainty,  
that so long as the number of people moving along the corridor towards  
the door is less than the number of people that can get through the door,  
the system will function with minimum risk. If the number of people  
moving along the corridor exceeds the number of people trying to get  
through the door, the risk of overcrowding \(and hence the risk of crush-  
ing\) increases. We can reach a situation where twice as many people are  
passing along the corridor than can get through the door. A crush can  
develop, but that will depend on how many people, over what period of  
time, are passing along the corridor trying to get through the door.  
The risk can be calculated in this way\: narrowest point in the system and  
flow rate towards that point, minus the flow rate past that point. A queue  
will develop, but the queue, provided it does not grow too large, is not a  
certainty of crushing. The risk will result from the number of people who  
continue to arrive, in excess of the number of people who can pass through  
the system. In this example, the risk of injury \(trips, slips and falls\) can start  
at zero \(no-one in the system\), will rise as the number of people begin to  
move through the system. When there is a sufficiently large queue of peo-  
ple, the risk of crushing exists, but the individual desire to proceed through  
the door must also be present to develop a crushing incident. Hence, there  
is an element of human behavior to consider in these situations.  
Until the point at which the number of people arriving at the door is equal  
to the number of people that can pass through the door, there is a minimal  
risk. Once that limit is reached, the risk of crushing rises at the rate at which  
more people arrive at the door with a desire to pass through it.  
This is a product of the number of people, the difference in the rates of  
passage \(door and corridor—the physical factors\), the desire to proceed  
and the time \(duration\) of exposure to the overcrowding \(the psychologi-  
cal factors\). The certainty of crushing, injury and the potential for fatali-  
ties will increase because of the time people are exposed to this situation,  
and of the number of people in the system at that time as will the desire  
to get through the door, thereby accelerating the rate of failure. This may  
appear complicated in writing, but there is a simple method of qualifying  
the possible risks using a diagram \(as demonstrated in Chapter 5, RAMP  
analysis\). Causality 73  
If the risks are recognised, and appropriate measures are deployed or  
implemented to manage those risks, then the likelihood that they will  
develop into an incident is controlled but the underlying risks have not  
changed. Underlying risks must be understood, and the process of identify-  
ing and managing \(or mitigating\) risks must be appropriately documented.  
There is a range of risk assessment, reporting and documentation pro-  
cesses and procedures available from many different, freely available  
sources. These rely on subjective \(personal\) assignments of a set of numbers  
\(likelihood and consequence known as quantitative risk assessment\) and a  
brief description of the risks and how they will be managed. Risks can, as  
we demonstrated in the corridor/door thought experiment earlier, have a  
range of values during an event.  
Risk of crushing is a function of the number of people in a given area;  
it is related to the rate at which a space becomes overcrowded. This is not  
a single, static number\: it has a dynamic property that needs to be both  
defined and understood.  
The rate at which a risk of overcrowding develops into a likelihood of  
crushing does not feature in the safety guidance \(e.g. in the UK HSG 195  
document The Event Safety Guide\). This potentially misleading and danger-  
ous oversight needs to be addressed. What is required is a method of identify-  
ing and documenting risks that are dynamic in nature; a workable definition,  
and a basic understanding of how quickly overcrowding becomes hazardous  
to life and limb. What is required is a method of assessing these types of risks  
during the planning and approval process, to prevent them from developing  
during an event.  
Problems lying in wait  
Risks that go unnoticed are called ‘problems lying in wait’. These are prob-  
lems that have not been considered or dealt with appropriately; risks that  
people knew about, or should have known about. Failure to identify risks  
that prove to be the underlying \(distal\) causes of major incidents may be  
defined as negligent. If these risks are not recognised during the planning  
and approval phases of an event, and the event then proceeds and the risks  
are realised, there may be questions of negligence relating to the risk assess-  
ment and the relevant parties may be held accountable.  
Accidents do not just happen; there is always a cause. Causation can be  
defined as follows\:\*  
Causation refers to the enquiry as to whether the defendant’s conduct  
\(or omission\) caused the harm or damage. \[…\] Causation in criminal  
liability is divided into factual causation and legal causation. Factual  
\*  
Source\: http\://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/Causation-in-criminal-liability.php 74 Introduction to crowd science  
causation is the starting point and consists of applying the ‘but for’ test.  
In most instances, where there exist no complicating factors, factual  
causation on its own will suffice to establish causation. \[…\] This asks,  
‘but for the actions of the defendant, would the result have occurred’?If  
yes, the result would have occurred in any event, the defendant is not  
liable. If the answer is no, the defendant is liable as it can be said that  
their action was a factual cause of the result.  
Wikipedia\* defines causation as follows\:  
\[…\] Causation proves a direct link between the defendant’s negligence  
and the claimant’s loss and damage. For these purposes, liability in neg-  
ligence is established when there is a breach of the duty of care owed  
by the defendant to the claimant that causes loss and damage, and it is  
reasonable that the defendant should compensate the claimant for that  
loss and damage.  
Proximate and distal causality  
The judicial system often does not distinguish between actual and proxi-  
mate cause, using the term ‘proximate cause’ to refer to both the actual  
cause and the underlying or ultimate causes of an incident. Part of the dif-  
ficulty in distinguishing the immediate and underlying causes \(and hence  
liability\) lies in the fact that the fundamental issues of proximate cause have  
little to do with the scientific definition of causation, and focus more on the  
social limits of liability. For the purposes of clarification, in the context of  
this book we are using the following definitions\:  
A proximate cause is an event that is closest to, or immediately respon-  
sible for causing some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher  
level ultimate cause or distal cause that is usually thought of as the funda-  
mental reason for an occurrence. Separating proximate and distal causality  
leads to a better understanding of the incidents and systems concerned. For  
example, why did the ship sink? The proximate cause might be because it  
hit a rock, but the underlying, distal cause may be because it was on auto-  
pilot and the radar system was switched off.  
A proximate cause may be defined as the action or event that is closest  
to, or immediately responsible for, causing an observed result. It is the most  
direct, effective or substantial cause of a tort—relevant where the negligence  
of more than one person contributed to the outcome. The distal cause is the  
larger context in which individuals carry out their actions, for example,  
where an agency substantially increases the probability of harm through  
conduct that falls below the standards of behaviour established by law for  
\*

the protection of others. To put this in context, we need a brief review of  
the UK\* legislation and guidance regarding crowd safety at events. Similar  
definitions exist in other countries, we refer to UK legislation as an example  
of these definitions.  
EVENT LEGISLATION  
In the context of a UK legal framework, an event falls under aspects of the  
Health and Safety at Work Act† 1974\. The following definitions apply\:  
The purposes of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 \(the HSW  
Act\) include protecting people other than those at work from risks to their  
health and safety arising out of or in connection with the activities of peo-  
ple at work. Section 3 of the HSW Act places general duties on employers  
and the self-employed towards people other than their employees.  
There are specific guidelines‡ from the UK Health and Safety Executive  
\(HSE\) for events in relation to the aforementioned act\:  
Planning  
The level of detail in your planning should be proportionate to the  
scale of the event and the degree of risk. \[…\] Whatever the scale of the  
event, make sure there is a clear understanding within the organising  
team of who will be responsible for safety matters.  
Safety plan  
As an event organiser, identify the\: scale, type and scope of the event,  
type and size of audience, location, duration of the event, time of day  
and year the event will be held. These factors will help you to determine  
what resources and facilities will be required. Translate this informa-  
tion into an appropriate safety plan. The key tool for creating a safety  
plan is the process of risk assessment.  
The safety plan must include an appropriate risk assessment. This must  
be in such a form that the licensing \(approval\) processor can understand  
and approve the plan as fit for purpose and, if appropriate, grant a licence  
for the event. The plan can, of course, be rejected as being unfit for pur-  
pose. As previously stated there are a number of events that do not require  
approval \(licensing\) and miss the crowd safety checking process.  
\*  
In a negligence claim \(at least in the United States\), there are actually two causation ele-  
ments that the plaintiff has to prove\: direct causation and proximate causation.

The Licensing Act 2003  
The Licensing Act 2003, Chapter 17 is an Act of the Parliament of the  
United Kingdom and sets out four licensing objectives, which must be taken  
into account when a local authority carries out its functions. They are\:  
1\. The prevention of crime and disorder  
2\. Public safety  
3\. Prevention of public nuisance  
4\. The protection of children from harm  
In Scotland there is a fifth licensing objective, which is\:  
5\. Protecting and improving public health  
Since the introduction of the Licensing Act 2003, licences are required  
for sale of alcohol and the provision of regulated entertainment. As an  
event planner, you will need some form of licence if you wish to carry out  
any of the following activities\:  
•  
•  
The sale of alcohol by retail anywhere, whether for consumption on  
or off the event premises  
The provision of regulated entertainment, namely\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The performance of a play  
The showing of a film  
An indoor sporting event  
Boxing or wrestling  
A performance of live music  
Any playing of recorded music \(excluding incidental background  
music unless played from a moving vehicle—carnivals/proces-  
sions, etc.\)  
•  
•  
A performance of dance  
Entertainment of a similar description to live music, recorded  
music or dance  
Where the entertainment takes place in the presence of the public, or a  
section of the public, you may also need a licence for the provision of hot  
food or hot drink.  
The role of checking whether an event is compliant with the Licensing  
Act is a function of a local licensing officer or committee. Their duties  
include providing information and guidance concerning the operation  
of the Licensing Act, and supervising the compliance by the holders of  
premises and occasional licences in respect of the licences that they hold.  
This monitoring aspect will ensure an ongoing check is in place and that  
licence holders are observing the licensing principles as well as the condi-  
tions placed upon the grant of their licences. A licensing officer may have Causality 77  
a statutory right to enter and inspect licensed premises for the purposes of  
determining whether the activities on the premises are being carried out in  
accordance with the Act. The licensing officer may also request to see any  
substances, articles or documents they see fit to examine.  
In summary, the licensing officer needs to be a competent person and  
should be able to understand the risks to the crowd in order to deem an  
event safe \(fit for purpose\) and grant a licence. Similar requirements exist  
in other parts of the world yet there is no mandatory minimum skill set or  
training for such officers or teams in relation to crowd safety.  
Negligence  
When we focus on crowd risk analysis during the planning and approval  
phases of an event, both the concept of a ‘duty of care’ to the public and  
the legal framework definitions may apply. In English law, the definition\*  
of negligence is\:  
Conduct that falls below the standards of behaviour established by law  
for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm. A person  
has acted negligently if he or she has departed from the conduct expected  
of a reasonably prudent person acting under similar circumstances.  
Our aim is to learn from the history of crowd accidents and to catego-  
rise the ‘things that can go wrong’. We do this so others can benefit from  
the information and improve working practices; to reduce crowd risks and  
improve crowd safety for future events. We do not aim to challenge the  
legal definitions, or previous legal outcomes—only to define terms of refer-  
ence in the context of crowd risks.  
We will outline, and demonstrate, some simple checks and measures that  
help identify the risk of crowd-related incidents, accidents or crush poten-  
tial. These risks can, and should, be recognised during the planning and  
approval phases of the event process. The objective of this book, and the  
courses we run around the world, are to inform, to educate and to demon-  
strate these principles, and their application, to planners, approval/licensing  
authorities and operators. These techniques are a low-cost way of assessing  
crowd risks for major events and complex sites.  
Definitions  
We will use the terms proximate and distal causality in relation to crowd  
accidents and incidents. In this context, distal causality, where an agency  
substantially increases the probability of harm by failing to identify—and  
\*

mitigate—substantial risks to the crowd during the planning and approval  
phases of the event. This failure may include, but is not limited to, recognis-  
ing the potential for overcrowding. This is a fundamental requirement; a  
basic skill set that requires some core \(but not complicated\) mathematical  
skills, including calculation of the space requirement for both static and  
throughput for a moving crowd.  
There is an apparent lack of rigour in applying basic scientific and engi-  
neering principles for crowd risk analysis; a failure to understand crowd den-  
sity, crowd flow rates and the time it can take for areas to reach critical crowd  
densities. There are also fundamental failures in understanding how crowds  
move towards, within and away from a site under normal and emergency  
situations. There are simple calculations for this type of analysis, and they  
must be applied with the same rigour as other engineering disciplines. We  
highlight that for all other parts of an event—such as the provision of suit-  
able electrical supplies, temporary demountable structures and food prepara-  
tion/hygiene—rigorous standards should be applied, checked and enforced.  
We will outline, from first principles, a more robust scientific method for  
crowd risk analysis and safety engineering for planned events and places of  
public assembly.  
Defining crowd disaster causality  
From our disaster database research, we defined three fundamental ele-  
ments that were common to major incidents\:  
1\. Design-related incidents, where there appears to have been a miscal-  
culation relating to the crowd flow and the space capacity.  
2\. Information-related incidents, where there appears to have been an  
external influence on the crowd behaviour that induced an accident/  
incident.  
3\. Management-related incidents; where there appears to have been one  
or more management decisions that were responsible for the accident/  
incident.  
A design-related incident, where an element of the site proved appropri-  
ate for its intended use, is a distal failure and should have been recognised  
and addressed during planning and approval. Information and manage-  
ment failures are proximate failures as they may have occurred due to  
unexpected unfolding events. The risk of these events unfolding should  
have featured in the event plan, the contingency plan and the emergency  
plan, which should have been approved by the relevant approval/licensing/  
permitting authority.  
Information and management failures should be the subject of ‘what if’  
scenarios during the planning stage. If these are missing, or poorly devised, Causality 79  
we would argue that these too are distal failures—failures in the underlying  
safety culture during the event planning and approval processes.  
Causality is one of the most complex legal issues for case law, but we  
would argue that failing to identify risk is a distal failure by definition. By  
failing to identify and mitigate risks that are reasonably foreseeable, ‘an  
agency substantially increases the probability of harm’.  
Causes of accidents/incidents  
We have acted as expert witness for several cases involving crowd-related  
incidents. Typically, these feature mass injuries and fatalities; in every case  
our first indicators of negligence were found in the risk assessment and in  
the event safety plan. Failure to recognise risk is evidence of either negli-  
gence or incompetence in event planning and approval phases of the event.  
This is not a new or novel concept.  
SITE DESIGN\: THEORY  
From John J. Fruin’s Causes and Preventions of Disasters, published in  
Engineering for Crowd Safety in 1993 \(p. 99\)\:  
Crowds occur frequently, usually without serious problems. Occasionally  
venue inadequacies and deficient crowd management result in injuries  
and fatalities.  
In the same paper, Fruin describes ‘The view from the crowd’ \(p. 102\)\:  
\[…\] When crowd density equals the plan area of the human body, indi-  
vidual control is lost, as one becomes an involuntary part of the mass.  
At occupancies of about seven persons per square metre, the crowd  
becomes almost a fluid mass. Shock waves can be propagated through  
the mass, sufficient to lift people off of their feet and propel them dis-  
tances of 3 m \(10 ft\) or more.  
Later in the paper, Fruin describes the forces involved in crowd-related  
disasters \(p. 103\)\:  
Crowd forces can reach levels that \[are\] almost impossible to resist or  
control. Virtually all crowd deaths are due to compressive asphyxia  
and not the ‘trampling’ reported by the news media. \[…\] Forces are  
due to pushing, and the domino effect of people leaning against each  
other. \[…\] Horizontal forces sufficient to cause compressive asphyxia  
would be more dynamic as people push off against each other to obtain  
breathing space. 80 Introduction to crowd science  
Again from the same paper, under the title Prevention of Crowd Disasters  
by Crowd Management, Fruin states\:  
Most major crowd disasters can be prevented by simple crowd man-  
agement strategies. The primary crowd management objectives are the  
avoidance of critical crowd densities.  
Fruin’s concept of prevention outlines the basic issues of crowd disasters,  
and we have expanded on these concepts. We first define the fundamental  
causalities and then we review the incidents to identify where crowd risks  
occur \(where in the event process they should be identified\) and then we  
outline tools and techniques to work through crowd risk analysis for events.  
To understand the reasoning behind this approach, we need to understand  
how major incidents have occurred.  
Investigating a major incident  
During the investigation phase for crowd-related incidents, we first exam-  
ine the event planning and site design to understand whether there was an  
inherent risk of overcrowding, and whether that risk was assessed and/or  
managed appropriately. Typically, this investigation reveals a poor or defi-  
cient risk analysis process.  
We then examine the site design from a theoretical perceptive; using prin-  
ciples defined by Fruin \(Pedestrian Planning and Design, 1971\) and then  
apply any calculations used by the event planner to test their competency  
in the risk assessment process. We compare our analysis with the event  
planners’ analysis and note any deficiencies in their planning process. From  
this point, we review the approval process to see whether these deficiencies  
were detected. Clearly if both processes failed to identify risk, and yet the  
plan was approved, then the conduct fell ‘below the standards of behaviour  
established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk  
of harm’.  
A primary investigation typically revolves around key questions\: Did the  
organiser and approval authority understand the risks? If not, why not?  
Would a reasonably competent practitioner understand those risks? If so,  
were the event planning and approval authorities competent in the execu-  
tion of their duty of care—to provide a safe environment for their event?  
We appraise the design using internationally recognised safety crite-  
ria in order to establish whether there were inherent risks in the design  
\(pointing to distal causality\), and whether those risks were predictable and  
avoidable \(reasonably foreseeable\). We then establish whether there were  
risks that went unnoticed and subsequently passed both the planning and  
approval stages. This gauges competency and the potential for charges of  
negligence. Causality 81  
Probability of harm  
If event plans contain inerrant risks that have not been identified during  
planning and approval, these risks may still be detected and rectified dur-  
ing the event \(the operations phase\). Good crowd management practices  
can keep an event safe, but if design-related risks are not identified before  
the operations phase, any failure in management can be catastrophic.  
Management of a risky environment, without knowledge of the risks, ‘sub-  
stantially increases the probability of harm’.  
CROWD FORCES  
In Causes and Preventions of Disasters, Fruin states \(p. 103\)\:  
Evidence of bent steel railings after several fatal crowd incidents shows  
that forces of more than 4,500 N \(1,000 lbs\) occurred. \[…\] Compressive  
asphyxia has occurred from people being stacked up vertically, one on  
top of the other, or horizontal pushing and leaning forces. In the Ibrox  
Park soccer stadium incident, police reported that the pile of bodies  
was 3 m \(10 ft\) high. At this height, people on the bottom would expe-  
rience chest pressures of 3,600–4,000 N \(800–900 lbs\), assuming half  
the weight of those above was concentrated in the upper body area.  
In the Cincinnati rock concert incident, a line of bodies was found  
approximately 9 m \(30 ft\) from a wall near the entrance. This indicates  
that crowd pressures probably came from both directions as rear ranks  
pressed forward and front ranks pushed off the wall.  
Experiments to determine concentrated forces on guardrails due to  
leaning and pushing have shown that force of 30% to 75% of partici-  
pant weight can occur. In a US National Bureau of Standards study of  
guardrails, three persons exerted a leaning force of 792 N \(178 lbs.\) and  
609 N \(137 lbs.\) pushing. In a similar Australian Building Technology  
Centre study, three persons in a combined leaning and pushing posture  
developed a force of 1,370 N \(306 lbs.\). This study showed that under  
a simulated ‘panic’, five persons were capable of developing a force of  
3,430 N \(766 lbs.\).  
At around 3000 N,\* there is a potential for a five-person-deep ‘push’ to  
break ribs. Gross bone fractures are noted at forces of around 6920 N.† We

Parameters—Proceedings of the 1998 SAE International Congress and Exposition. SAE

can conclude that the crowd, by itself, can produce sufficient force to cre-  
ate serious risk to life and limb, and therefore an emphasis on appropriate  
planning, crowd risk analysis, approval \(licensing\) and event operations is  
vital to crowd safety. What we need is a methodology to identify whether  
there are elements of risk we can identify—and eliminate—during the plan-  
ning and approval phases of the event process.  
Reasonably foreseeable  
One could argue that many major incidents were ‘reasonably foreseeable’ if  
the event organiser failed to identify a risk that a competent person could  
identify using information that is freely available \(e.g. Fruin\). The event  
organiser would be deemed negligent in the executions of one’s duty of care  
and in failing to provide a safe environment under the legislation \(HSW Act\).  
This relates to all parts of an event, but specifically to the event ingress/  
entry system, where the crowd pressure and frustrations are often greatest.  
It also covers the site capacity \(number of people that the site can safely  
accommodate\) and intended usage and egress capacity \(rate at which a  
crowd can enter or leave a site\). Risk analysis also needs to consider both  
normal and emergency situations. Risk analysis should not be an ad hoc  
process; it must be structured in a systematic and methodical manner to  
ensure that all elements of risk as considered. A structured and methodical  
approach also facilitates a thorough approval process, which could other-  
wise be difficult to read and understand.  
For the crowd risk analysis, there are several considerations\: site capac-  
ity, movement pathways, entry and exit systems, utilisation and facilities  
management during normal and emergency situations.  
Site capacity  
Site capacity is typically calculated based on the available area, the suit-  
ability of that area and the rates of egress in an emergency. Site capacity  
is also based on physical and safety considerations for a site. International  
guidance also recommends assessment of ingress \(entry rates\) as an impor-  
tant safety factor that may reduce the overall site capacity if not sufficient  
to meet the arrival profile of the crowds. All parts of the system need to  
be considered; failure to do so may be classed as ‘conduct that falls below  
the standards of behaviour established by law for the protection of others  
against unreasonable risk of harm’, and would qualify as a distal failure in  
the planning and approval processes.  
Entry and exit points  
Although the crowd may be on public ground \(approach routes\), they may  
be exposed to risk while trying to enter an event. To illustrate this point, Causality 83  
consider a crowd moving towards the entry system with the expectation  
of entering the site. If the arrival flow \(people moving towards the entry  
system\) exceeds the capacity of the entry system \(number of people moving  
through the entry system\), a queue will develop.  
If the arrival flow rate exceeds the entry system capacity, then people  
arriving at the back of the queue arrive more quickly \(people per minute\)  
than the people at the front of the queue \(the people nearest the entry sys-  
tem\) can be processed. This results in a gradual build-up of crowd density  
\(people per square metre\), over time, at the point immediately in front of  
the entry system. As the crowd/queue size grows, the density at the front  
part of the queue will be compressed, increasing the crowd density and  
exposing the crowd to risk of crushing.  
As crowd density \(people per square metre\) increases to above six or seven  
people per square metre, the crowd reaches a point at which individuals  
experience physical contact and pressure. Prolonged exposure to this pres-  
sure has a detrimental effect on crowd behaviour, and there is an inherent  
risk to life and limb. Those individuals at the front of an entry system queue  
\(as described earlier\) can become trapped. They cannot remove themselves  
from the system, as the back of the queue is moving towards the entry point.  
There is a fundamental requirement to understand this specific problem  
and to ensure that this kind of situation does not develop.  
Movement pathways  
In Causes and Preventions of Disaster, under the heading Movement  
Pathways, Fruin states \(p. 106\)\:  
Arrangements that result in unbalanced use of egress or ingress routes,  
dead ends, or similar confusing and irregular pathway choices, are  
not acceptable. \[…\] Dispersed and equally balanced ingress and egress  
points are preferred over a single centralized location. The influence of  
external facilities on the volume and direction of movement must be  
considered.  
A balanced ingress and egress system would be a system in which the  
entry and exit points are distributed around a site and not focused on any  
one point. These are neither new nor novel considerations for a major event.  
These are based on the principles and applications of risk analysis and risk  
management.  
Site design\: Pinch points  
To facilitate the movement of large crowds over several hours at a major  
event, the routes around the site should not have any significant narrow 84 Introduction to crowd science  
sections—or ‘pinch points’—that can create congestion \(crowding\) and  
lead to crushing. As with the entry system described earlier, any part of an  
event, stadium or complex space with a pinch point means the crowds can  
potentially flow into a specific area faster than it can flow out of it. Pinch  
points can quickly develop high-density crowds, and there is subsequently a  
high risk of slips, trips and falls, crowd surges and pressure on those parts  
of the system build up. Again, these need to be identified in the risk assess-  
ment process by all parties involved in the planning and approval/licensing/  
permitting processes.  
Risk analysis and risk management feature in all engineering disciplines.  
They are generally regulated by governing authorities and legislated accord-  
ing to accepted engineering standards. These same standards need to be  
applied to crowd safety. At the time of writing this book, no such standards  
exit for the event planning and/or event approval process.  
UNDERLYING CAUSALITY  
Three primary failures, or underlying causes, emerge from the analysis  
of past incidents. The first relates to space requirement \(design failure\)—  
namely where the size of the space \(area\) is smaller than the total area  
required for people who are trying to occupy that space, resulting in  
crowd crush incidents and loss of life. Central to this are two relatively  
simple bits of information, the available area for the crowd, and num-  
ber of people trying to get into that area. We can look at this in several  
different ways—for example, consider a system with gates \(entry points\)  
leading to an event space, and a crowd trying to enter the system through  
the gates. This system will have a finite \(limited\) crowd flow rate based on  
the width \(or number\) of gates. In nontechnical language, the wider the  
entry system, the greater the number of gates, the greater the crowd flow  
into the system. An event designer, or site planner, should consider these  
elements to ensure the space is big enough to accommodate the crowd’s  
space requirements.  
Failure to provide sufficient space leads to overcrowding and the risk of  
crowd crushing or personal injury. This same rationale applies to all parts  
of a system where crowds move through complex spaces. Corridors, roads,  
entry points and event spaces all need to be large enough for the crowd try-  
ing to occupy that space. If they are not, there will be a crush. On review of  
the historical accidents and incidents, we can recognise, as a primary point  
of failure, this lack of sufficient space for the crowds.  
Another key element to understand is the rate of fill, how quickly spaces  
are occupied. Faster rates of filling can result in other problems, which we  
outline in later chapters. Causality 85  
Plan for the worse case  
Organisers of free events often protest, ‘But we don’t know how many peo-  
ple may come to this event!’ To which the reply is always, ‘What is your  
site capacity?’  
The first step in such cases would be to assess the maximum capacity \(the  
maximum number of people using the event space\). The next step would  
be to assess how the crowds will enter and exit that space. Separate plans  
for 50% occupation, 100% occupation and 500% occupation of the space  
should be considered. Then a comparison of the risk for each option—and  
a separate plan for each option—needs to be considered. This is a methodi-  
cal approach to risk assessment; the excuse ‘we didn’t know how many  
people might come’ only points to incompetency in planning.  
Overcrowding incidents  
In our research, we defined incidents that appeared to be design-limited,  
or space requirement failures, as ‘overcrowding incidents’ and reviewed the  
areas involved in those incidents. We found that by applying simple calcu-  
lations—such as how much area was available to the crowd, how the area  
was used, what the entry points were, how quickly the area could fill with  
people—the risk of serious injury could be anticipated prior to the event.  
Failing to provide a safe environment for the crowd—failing to anticipate  
the crowd numbers, crowd arrival rates and crowd throughput rate—is a  
common element linking many disasters. It points to an underlying system-  
atic failure in the process of the planning and approval/licensing/permitting  
processes; it is a failure to understand the crowd risks in the complex and  
built environment. During investigation of the historical database, we found  
no evidence of competency in applying those relatively simple calculations.  
Throughput incidents  
We also noted that there were throughput incidents, where the system could  
not cope with the demand\: in other words, there were too many people try-  
ing to get into/out of/through a space, and the result was crushing. Again,  
this pointed towards poor planning, failure to anticipate the crowd dynamic  
and failure to apply the necessary calculations for the crowd’s space require-  
ments. Again, the news reports would blame crowd behaviour for the failure  
and not a planning, approval \(permitting/licensing\) or operational failure.  
To a lesser extent, there were incidents that involved information fail-  
ure. These are where something changed in the environment and created  
a crowd reaction \(such as a sudden downpour of rain, or crowd crazing\),  
and could therefore be identified as a root cause of the accident. Failing to 86 Introduction to crowd science  
anticipate that the crowd would potentially ‘run for cover’ if it suddenly  
began to rain, or be attracted to a specific point of interest, also points  
towards planning/approval failure. In summary, the information failures  
were all related to a lack of understanding of the human factors.  
Crowd and event modelling  
We have developed a range of modelling techniques that do not use com-  
puter simulations. We will outline these in Chapter 5, as well as explaining  
how they can be applied during the planning process for major events. We  
break down crowd problems into phases \(ingress/circulation/egress\) and  
demonstrate how to arrange the subsequent information in an event man-  
ual. We explain how to divide an event into time zones \(as different factors  
will occur as the event plays out\). We also outline how to structure an event  
plan like a storyboard, describing the event as it is anticipated to evolve, to  
create a readable, useable and understandable document. The reason this is  
essential to the event process is that it reduces the potential for harm. Chapter 4  
# Crowd science  
The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they  
mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct,  
which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes  
observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical con-  
struct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work—that is correctly  
to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area. Furthermore, it  
must satisfy certain aesthetic criteria—that is, in relation to how much  
it describes, it must be rather simple.

INTRODUCTION  
In Chapter 5, we will introduce several modelling techniques for crowd and  
event risk analysis. These techniques have been developed over a decade of  
working on many different projects and teaching programmes, and have  
been applied to crowd and event safety around the world. They are neither  
theoretical nor academic constructs; they are tried and tested methods. We  
have applied these techniques to a wide range of events, from small crowds  
to vast gatherings, and have taught over 6000 delegates the associated prin-  
ciples and applications for use at their own events.  
Initially, the techniques were developed in order to capture information  
for our consultancy projects—specifically in Saudi Arabia, where language  
differences made it difficult to read documents. The tools proved useful for  
structuring information for analysis, and for passing on that information  
to all levels of event operators. The process involved developing a stan-  
dardised template, or meta-model,\* of crowd and event dynamics for risk  
analysis and value engineering \(optimal use of space\). It has proven to be a  
useful and teachable methodology—one that could be used for all events  
and public gatherings.  
\*  
A meta-model typically defines the language and processes that are used to create a model.  
87 88 Introduction to crowd science  
It may seem strange that after years of development and significant finan-  
cial investment that we abandoned all but the simplest of visualising tools  
for crowd risk analysis and crowd modelling. The main reason for this  
relates to how the crowds simulations were being used, to prove safety.  
Not, as originally intended, to discover the risks associated with crowds in  
complex spaces.  
Not how we would do it!  
As we stated in Chapter 2, the programmer defines the core crowd behav-  
iours in a computer crowd simulation and the end user can alter the param-  
eters on those programmed behaviours. There are many variables in a crowd  
simulation and each must be tested against the others to assess its overall  
impact against the result. Suppose a system had five variables\: it would be  
necessary to conduct between 5 and 15 tests \(5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1\) in order to test  
each variable against all the others, and the number of tests increases more  
as we add more variables. This is called ‘analytical intractability’\: effectively  
there are so many potential variations that it would take too long to test them  
all. So, computer scientists develop models to simplify the overall simulation  
process in order to obtain a result in a reasonable time.  
While programming the code for crowd and environment modelling, we  
were finding that crowd routes had to be programmed into the system,  
and that meant the outputs were direct functions of the end user’s inputs.  
This again highlighted that the skill of the end user determined the value  
of the simulation output. Single-value outputs \(such as the time taken for  
a crowd to egress a building\) indicated that only one simulation had been  
evaluated. Multiple runs would have \(or should have\) produced a range of  
values with mean and standard deviations—a measurement of how much  
variation there was in the simulation’s performance, which of course takes  
time to assess the variations.  
A computer scientist would test the sensitivity of key variables. Where  
the ‘new’ crowd simulations deviated from the original PhD crowd simula-  
tion was in the fact that we had designed the original simulation system  
to explore the ways crowded spaces may fail, as a risk analysis tool. The  
‘new’ crowd simulation system appeared to be developed along a different  
methodology, and the users were validating complex spaces, proving them  
to work!  
The reason for this was simple\: it was expensive to buy simulation sys-  
tems and to train operators, and it was time consuming to build models.  
The cost drives the market, and the market was the consultants and the  
project executives, who needed to be reassured that their investments were  
sound—just as we had anticipated. No one wants to spend the significant  
capital investment to discover problems. Crowd science 89  
Lessons from the workshops  
Delegates were coming to the workshops with printouts and simulation  
movie clips, and they were questioning the outputs. Clearly, this issue was  
of concern to the people on the front line of crowd management—the peo-  
ple who could actually make a difference to crowd safety. We needed to  
understand the nature of their concerns, and why so many delegates were  
questioning these simulation tools.  
The opening statement of the concluding section of the PhD asserts\:  
There were three objectives to this research\: Firstly, to understand the  
nature of crowd dynamics with respect to crowd safety; secondly, to  
develop a more appropriate risk analysis methodology for the design  
and management of places where crowds may develop. Finally, to cre-  
ate a tool that allows others to understand the nature, problems and  
necessary components of crowds and crowd dynamics.  
G. Keith Still, PhD thesis\: Crowd Dynamics, 2000, p. 262  
The tools we had developed sought to address the first and last objectives  
\(i.e. Legion, Paramics UAF, Myriad, Shepard, Progressive Crowd Collapse,  
Spatial Analysis, Network Flow, Tawaf models\). However, as we observed,  
when others were using these tools \(and many other simulations in the mar-  
ket\) the results were seldom focussed on risk analysis. We noted that often  
crowd simulations were focussed on proving that a system will work, often  
with unspecified assumptions and little or no validation. This was a worry-  
ing development—a focus on proof of concept and not on the investigation  
of how systems may fail. Of more concern was the fact that the risk analysis  
element seemed to be omitted from the consulting reports we were observing  
during the workshop sessions. Using these tools, it was possible to under-  
stand the nature of the crowd dynamic with respect to crowd safety, and it  
was possible to test the sensitivity of certain psychological parameters, and  
to assess different types of behaviour under computer laboratory conditions.  
Nevertheless, that was not how they were being used for major projects.  
The first objective, ‘to understand the nature of crowd dynamics with  
respect to crowd safety’, was not being met. The second objective was ‘to  
develop a more appropriate risk analysis methodology’, although possible  
with the aforementioned simulation systems, was also failing to make any  
significant impact on improving crowd safety. Computer simulations were  
simply not reaching the target audience; not the computer scientists, but those  
groups who had a direct impact on crowd management. The third objective,  
‘to create a tool that allows others to understand the nature, problems and  
necessary components of crowds’, was clearly not being achieved, as simula-  
tions were proving too expensive for the business end of event safety. 90 Introduction to crowd science  
The problem with simulation  
Some delegates were coming to the workshops displaying computer mod-  
els they simply did not understand; their company had paid huge con-  
sulting fees to have these simulations produced, and had paid for reports  
and analysis that merely told them the system works, when they knew,  
instinctively, they had a problem. These delegates were still looking for  
solutions. It appeared that the crowd simulation route was all cost and no  
real benefit.  
Why had this happened?  
Clients do not want to be told their investments may fail; they want to have  
their confidence in the project reassured, and they often hire consultants  
who produce simulations that will show the positive aspects of their proj-  
ect. Consultants using crowd simulations that constantly point out how  
things will fail do not win business contracts. This also drives the process  
towards ‘proof of concept’, where simulations are used to demonstrate how  
things work, not stress testing them to understand how things may fail.  
The approach we take, in the workshops, was the same we developed  
to capture information prior to inputting the relevant data to a computer  
simulation. That approach focuses on modelling.  
MODELLING  
A model—be it a physical model such as a model aeroplane in a wind tun-  
nel, or a complex digital simulation of a crowd—captures only part of the  
reality for analysis. That is a fundamental principle of modelling; a simpli-  
fication of the system that is under examination.  
Crowds are complex; they consist of many individual human minds,  
sometimes behaving in unison \(say at a concert, rally or protest\), sometimes  
opposing each other \(say as opposing fans at a football or sporting event\),  
sometimes as random elements in a complex space \(at shopping centres/  
malls and in streets\). To understand the entire range of human behaviour  
and possible reactions would require comprehensive knowledge of those  
things. It would also require extensive testing in order to understand all the  
possible outcomes of any given set of initial conditions. This would make it  
a very expensive and time-consuming exercise. The costs would need to be  
passed onto the client, and this has, in certain commercial crowd simula-  
tions, restricted information published for other researchers to use in their  
competing crowd simulations. Crowd science 91  
External influences on crowd behaviour  
Further complications arise in building a computer simulation of a crowd,  
as the individuals are also influenced by external events such as weather  
changes, announcements, management styles and information systems,  
design of buildings, barriers and entrance foyers. The list is endless and  
the models are simplifications of the real world. Simulations are, by defini-  
tion, only part of the overall analysis of crowds in the complex and built  
environment.  
When we were using simulations to test how a system might fail, we  
were testing a limited set of variables in order to determine how risks  
developed, to understand the nature and rates of failure. We noticed that  
many others \(crowd scientists, consultants and the like\) were using com-  
puter simulations to prove that a system would work, but in order to prove  
whether or not a system will work you need to test all possible initial  
conditions.  
The emphasis is on the word ‘proving’. This is an onerous, costly and  
time-consuming function. It requires far more data and inputs to be vali-  
dated. To prove something means to have tested all possible combinations  
and provide a measure of certainty that A, B, C inputs will produce, consis-  
tently, X, Y, Z outcomes. With so many variables and uncertainties across  
a wide range of possible crowd behaviours—under many different and  
dynamic changes to the environments—this may be an intractable prob-  
lem. It may never be defined as a proof.  
To clarify this, and in the light of our own use of simulation systems  
mentioned in the previous pages, we will illustrate the case in point using  
the Jamarat Bridge project. The pilgrims’ ritual \(‘stoning the devil’\) has  
a series of phases\: approach the pillar, throw the pebbles, move to near-  
est space, spend time making a prayer, move to the second pillar, throw  
the pebbles, move to nearest space, spend time making a prayer, move to  
the third pillar, throw the pebbles, leave the system. The objective of the  
model was to determine the sensitivity of three critical spaces\: the entry  
ramp width, the throughput capacity of the system and the egress capac-  
ity. To that aim, a fundamental model of the system was produced and the  
simulation was used to assess the critical input, throughput and output  
components \(widths\).  
As with all engineering disciplines and associated methodologies, the  
objective was to understand the limits of a system—to test it to destruc-  
tion, understand how and when it breaks, and then define the construction  
parameters in order to minimise the risk of the system breaking. We used  
the simulation to understand how the system might fail, then to inform the  
design teams and provide training outlines and management courses on  
how to manage that system safely. 92 Introduction to crowd science  
We then designed into the Jamarat Bridge safety margins, additional  
spaces to allow for variance in the crowd behaviour and contingency spaces  
for medical or other emergencies. We did not use simulations merely to  
prove the system works!  
By creating a balanced system, where ingress flow rate was less than  
throughput flow rate, and where egress flow rate capacity was greater than  
throughput flow rate capacity. In doing this, we ensured that there were no  
design bottlenecks in the system. We provided a fundamental design input  
by reducing the potential of design-related problems. In any crowded envi-  
ronment, the system can still fail under certain conditions; those conditions  
need to be understood and managed appropriately in order to prevent such  
a failure.  
That should be the objective of crowd modelling\: to understand how  
crowd risks develop and to inform the design, information and manage-  
ment processes of the nature of those potential failures. Crowd simulations,  
where the environment or the crowd parameters are changed to assess a  
design change inform the design process, but this does not evaluate the  
whole spectrum of crowd stimuli; crowds also were influenced by informa-  
tion and management processes.  
Deadly consequences  
Sadly, we know of two specific examples where people have misused com-  
puter simulations of crowds. In those cases, a poorly designed crowd simu-  
lation was used to assess how crowds might pass through a complex system.  
The system was subsequently approved as safe in the simulation. Sadly, in  
the real world mass fatalities resulted during operation.  
With the proliferation of crowd simulations, and the competitive nature  
of the market, it is inevitable that this will happen again. Part of the aim  
of this publication is to make end users aware that there is an inher-  
ent danger in the misuse of crowd simulations, and that there are lower  
cost, more effective and appropriate tools, techniques and methodologies  
available.  
CROWD DYNAMICS AND CROWD SCIENCE  
In Chapter 1, we described noting at workshops that crowd managers had  
a deep distrust of crowd simulations. To understand why this is the case, we  
need to outline the core problem with crowd dynamics simulations. Crowd science 93  
In the PhD thesis, we described crowd dynamics as follows\:  
Crowd dynamics can be defined as the study of how and where crowds  
form, and move, above the critical density threshold of more than  
one person per square metre. At low density \(below one person per  
square metre\) individuals have freedom to choose routes, directions,  
read information and react to their environment. At high density \(more  
than six or seven people per square metre\) there is the potential for  
overcrowding and personal injury. It is important to understand the  
dynamics of crowds, how crowds understand and interpret informa-  
tion systems, how management systems affect crowd behaviour and  
how, where, when and why accidents occur.  
The simulations we developed allow the study of simulated crowd move-  
ments; how and when the crowd reaches certain critical densities; how long  
it will take to fill spaces and then empty. Typically, this involves the study  
of crowd limits; how fast the crowd can move under certain conditions  
and when an area may reach capacity in built and complex environments.  
Although there are many variables—such as individual characteristics,  
external influences, environment, terrain and the weather \(there is a long  
list\)—we can determine the fundamental dynamics of crowds and the  
­ relationship between the model and the model environment.  
The original PhD research goal was to understand crowd dynamics as  
it related to crowd risks, and to use that information to inform those indi-  
viduals who manage crowds. As a result, the original software modelling  
and simulation systems were designed to understand crowd risks by experi-  
menting with the simulation—for example, by testing combined flows over  
different times through complex spaces to determine how, when and where  
areas may become problematic, the phrase used is sometimes ‘has the  
potential to become challenging’. We used these simulations to understand  
crowd risks, and to explore a range of parameters in order to understand  
the underlying components of those risks.  
We also explored the different types of geometry that could lead to crush-  
ing incidents, and developed progressive crowd collapse models to study  
the phenomena. Shockwave models help us understand the pressures and  
potential consequences of high-density compression, the waves of motion  
through the crowd and what elements may gives rise to a shockwave. With  
our wide range of crowd modelling tools, we could explore the potential  
causality of accidents and incidents. This is not possible with a real crowd  
as the risks to life and limb would be significant.  
Computer simulations that allow the user the opportunity to explore the  
movement of crowds, and to understand the crowd dynamic, are also very  
useful for problems that require optimisation of time and use of space \(value 94 Introduction to crowd science  
engineering\). But they need to be treated with care when applied to accident  
analysis.  
Simulation danger  
Unless a simulation can mimic the behaviour and reactions of crowds under  
extreme conditions, it may be misleading—and in some cases dangerously  
misleading. We have witnessed several major incidents where the event  
‘passed’ a simulation test. For example, a simulation that does not exceed  
6.25 people per square metre, used to model a high-density, high-throughput  
system, would show a slow progression through that system, but the reality  
of the situation would be serious risk to life and limb. The results may be  
ambiguous to a layperson and need to be interpreted by experts.  
We need to stress that the development of crowd simulations has been  
rapid and widely distributed around the world, and there may be many  
more serious incidents ‘lying in wait’. Enhanced computer graphics may  
look nice, but experts need to interpret the results.  
Nice to look at\: But is it real?  
High-resolution graphics—specifically the effects that are seen in movies—  
have set a high standard for computer simulations. Hollywood crowd  
simulations focus on how the movement of crowds will look to the viewer  
and, depending on the core algorithm \(the numerical formulae within the  
computer system\), they can look very realistic.  
The real world is not the same as the computer-generated world; there  
are many aspects of crowd behaviour that can impact on safety, such as  
individual aggression, interactions between rival factions at a protest, the  
influence of criminal behaviour, weather, sudden unexpected noises and  
the like. Although the simulations can be enhanced through the under-  
standing of certain behavioural characteristics, they are still based on lim-  
ited sets of untestable assumptions relating to human behaviour in complex  
spaces. For example, how do you validate/calibrate human ‘aggression’?  
How would the influence of a drunk behaving badly affect the crowd?  
What other environmental changes, that may be untested in a simulation,  
might affect safety? We once observed a sudden crowd crush, for reasons  
unknown, near a wide tunnel entrance; on inspection after the event, we  
noted a large horse ‘deposit’ in the tunnel. The smell was unpleasant, but  
the resulting crowd congestion could have proven to be hazardous.  
To expand on this point\: crowd simulations facilitate the study of the  
fundamentals of crowd movement and interactions \(dynamics\) through  
space, over time. They test a very narrow range of human behaviour under  
an assumed set of conditions. Those assumptions may be severely limited  
and may not consider a wide range of potential scenarios. An authentic Crowd science 95  
simulation report should state all the input assumptions to be truthful  
and honest with regard to the simulation’s limits. These are scientific and  
engineering principles that need to be rigorously applied for safety-critical  
environments. Furthermore, the outputs of a crowd simulation must be  
understood in the wider context of crowd behaviour and crowd manage-  
ment. Crowd simulations can only model a small part of the overarching  
complexity of crowds and human behaviour; this should be clearly stated  
whenever these tools are used for safety-critical applications. We cannot  
stress that point enough.  
CAVEAT EMPTOR  
The typical waiver on almost all software will normally contain a caveat  
that absolves the software company of all potential liability for use of  
application\:  
Under no circumstances will XYZ be liable for any losses or damages  
whatsoever, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, from the use of, or  
reliance on, the software. Neither XYZ nor any of its subsidiaries or  
licensors shall be liable for loss of profits, loss or inaccuracy of data, or  
indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even if advised  
of the possibility of such damages. Nothing in this limitation of liabil-  
ity shall limit XYZ’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its  
negligence or the negligence of its employees.  
You see the same disclaimers on any product that could be used incor-  
rectly; the user is responsible for the inputs and the interpretation of the  
resulting data. Caveat emptor\: let the buyer beware.  
Crowd science\: The bigger picture  
We still use crowd simulations \(where the situation dictates\), but they gen-  
erally only help us identify or quantify a risk. The simulation process is  
only one small part of a much larger picture. The wider objective is to  
understand and evaluate the spectrum of risks associated with crowds in  
public places, and to apply engineering standards and solutions to the pro-  
cess. These risks have many different dimensions; we need to understand  
their form and nature, their location, duration and severity. To that aim  
we developed a much simpler approach to the problem of risk analysis, and  
built a range of crowd models, for crowd managers to use and understand.  
The philosophy of a crowd model should be that it is simple to use, sim-  
ple to understand, simple to communicate the problems to the user and  
simple to apply to the event planning and approval process. The objective 96 Introduction to crowd science  
of a model is to identify risks \(or hazards\) once a model is built, the risks  
do not magically disappear.  
Risks and hazards  
It is worth noting that the UK Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\) defines\*  
risk and hazard as follows\:  
Hazard and risk are used interchangeably in everyday vocabulary.  
Nevertheless, it has proved useful to HSE to make a conceptual distinc-  
tion between a ‘hazard’ and a ‘risk’ by describing a hazard as the potential  
for harm arising from an intrinsic property or disposition of something to  
cause detriment, and risk as the chance that someone or something that is  
valued will be adversely affected in a stipulated way by the hazard.  
HSE—as far as the health, safety and welfare of people is concerned—  
frequently makes use of the above conceptual distinction in its guidance  
by requiring that hazards be identified, the risks they give rise to are  
assessed and appropriate control measures introduced to address the  
risks.  
The term ‘hazard’ is absent in the HSW Act. However, the Courts  
have ruled that as far as section 3 of the Act is concerned, ‘risk’ means  
‘possibility of danger’ rather than ‘actual danger’ \(see paragraphs  
41–42\). Conceptually, HSE will therefore regard anything presenting  
the ‘possibility of danger’ as a ‘hazard’.  
Moreover, since in any given workplace there would be a large num-  
ber of hazards that duty holders could address, requiring duty hold-  
ers formally to address them all would place an excessive and largely  
useless burden on them. So as not to impose unnecessary burdens on  
duty holders, HSE will not expect them to take account of hazards  
other than those that are a reasonably foreseeable cause of harm, tak-  
ing account of reasonably foreseeable events and behaviour.  
There are several key points pertaining to the event planning and approval  
process, relating to the aforementioned quote. The first is that the definition  
of hazards as ‘the potential for harm’ and risks as ‘the chance that someone  
\[…\] will be adversely affected \[…\] by the hazard’ are differentiated.  
Crowd hazards  
A ‘hazard’, in the context of crowd safety for events, may be a bottleneck  
or some part of a system that may constrain crowd flow, leading to conges-  
tion and potentially crushing. By definition, these may not be recognised  
\*  
Reducing Risks, Protecting People \(2001, ISBN 0 7176 2151 0\). Crowd science 97  
as hazards as defined by the HSE. A turnstile, for example, is not a hazard  
until the crowd arrival rates exceed the turnstile throughput or operating  
rate. At that time, a queue may develop; if the queue is left unchecked and  
is not managed; a crush may develop and there is now risk to life and limb.  
Similarly, bottlenecks \(or pinch points\) identified by a modelling process  
may not be a hazard until the crowd interacts with the geometry\: at that  
point risks can be qualified and appropriately managed. The pinch point  
is not, in itself, a hazard. It will function without risk until the arrival rate  
exceeds the throughput rate. The importance of this, in the context of crowd  
modelling and our original use of simulations, is that the objective was to  
identify, classify and understand these types of risks.  
On the value placed on risk assessment\:  
… requiring that hazards be identified, the risks they give rise to are  
assessed and appropriate control measures introduced to address the risks.  
This may also be confusing in the context of an interacting and dynamic  
system, such as combined crowd flows, congestion and sudden environmen-  
tal changes creating a crowd reaction. These can be difficult to describe in  
words in a conventional risk assessment; they can be equally difficult to  
classify and quantify.  
The final statement in the aforementioned extract\:  
So as not to impose unnecessary burdens on duty holders, HSE will  
not expect them to take account of hazards other than those that are  
a reasonably foreseeable cause of harm \[…\] of reasonably foreseeable  
events and behaviour.  
This implies there is no requirement for a rigorous, systematic, methodi-  
cal approach to risk assessment, risk classification and risk mitigation. It is  
important to note that even the most basic requirements for quality assur-  
ance, necessary for other, safety critical engineering disciplines, are not a  
requirement, for crowd risk assessment. The HSE statement “so as not  
to impose unnecessary burdens on duty holders…” has been used, by the  
defense, as the proverbial ‘get out of jail free’ card in several HSE prosecu-  
tions. If you compare two risk assessments from two different individuals  
who are asked to review the same event site, they may define and quan-  
tify the risks in very different terms and values. Similarly, if you read the  
accident reports and near miss accounts from crowd managers, the most  
common defense is\: ‘This was totally unexpected’. The risk assessment and  
classification process is experiential and very subjective; if we cannot define,  
classify, structure and quantise the risk in a consistent and structured man-  
ner, it follows that we cannot quantify the level of risk we may be exposing  
the crowd to in a complex and built environment. 98 Introduction to crowd science  
The purpose of a model  
The goal is to improve crowd safety through the application of crowd and  
event risk analysis models. One reason why the concept of simulations fails  
in this specific domain is that the computer systems require a high level of  
training to develop and use, which may be construed as an ‘unnecessary  
burden on duty holders’. As we pointed out in Chapter 1, the people with  
the most experience in crowd safety were not the users of crowd simulation  
systems. The simulation experts were computer scientists, often with little  
or no real crowd management experience, and the cost of hiring this exper-  
tise is a burden on budget and time in the event process.  
This was our primary reason for establishing simpler and more useful  
technologies for crowd risk analysis and crowd safety engineering\: to avoid  
that ‘unnecessary burden’, to bring about a step change in both the clas-  
sification and understanding of crowds risks.  
ARE ALL CROWD SIMULATIONS BAD?  
We need to examine the nature of the crowd simulation in a wider and  
deeper context in order to understand its application and limitations.  
A crowd simulation is expected to work, to be fit for purpose. There are  
dozens of crowd simulations on the market, ranging from good to bad to  
outright dangerous. So how do we differentiate a good simulation from the  
bad simulation?  
To put it bluntly, you would need a degree in computer science to under-  
stand the differences and subtleties of different crowd simulations. If people  
are injured, if lives are lost, then the event organiser, the licensing/approval  
offices and the event operators \(stewarding/security/police\) may be faced  
with a lawsuit, not the computer simulation of the consultant. Remember  
the modelling/consulting disclaimers\: caveat emptor.  
That is the core of the problem.  
After the event!  
It is only when an incident occurs in the real world that the crowd simula-  
tion can be questioned. Did the simulation predict the problem? It is only  
when a simulation has proved not to work—when lives have been lost—  
that those vital questions are asked, and by then it is too late. That is why  
we felt there was a need to go back to the basic principles and applications  
of the crowd dynamics PhD concepts—specifically to the use and misuse  
of simulations—to understand the core problem of crowds in the complex  
and built environment; to understand the crowd risks. We had to develop  
an approach that the crowd managers could use, at low cost, which would Crowd science 99  
be evident to the planning, approval and operations phases of the event  
process. To justify this principle, we need some essential descriptions of the  
crowd dynamic within the context of a simulation.  
What is a crowd?  
A crowd is, by definition, a collection of individuals. We cannot know what  
goes on in the mind of an individual, how their mood may shape their  
behaviour. We cannot predict every factor that may influence behaviour.  
The combination of elements and composition of crowds makes this an  
analytically intractable\* problem. To reiterate this specific point, we need to  
know all the potential variables, and satisfy a sufficiently rigorous test cri-  
terion to establish the sensitivity analysis of those variables on the potential  
outcome. The following example illustrates this concept.  
Imagine a little old lady in a crowd. If she is at the front of the crowd,  
her pace of movement may influence everyone behind her. This, of course,  
relates to the geometry of the environment \(say a corridor or narrow stairs\).  
In other words, her movement can slow the progress of the entire crowd  
under certain conditions. If the little old person were at the back of the  
crowd in the same environment, her movement would have no impact on  
the crowd’s progress. The same principle applies to a slow-moving vehicle  
on a busy road\: traffic slows to the pace of the slowest-moving vehicle at the  
front of the traffic on the narrow road. An individual’s position, under cer-  
tain key conditions, can have a significant impact on the outcome of such a  
situation. With regard to simulations, this effect requires careful filtering of  
the set-up and numerous sensitivity tests to establish whether condition ‘A’  
\(little old lady\) has any impact on the outcome of a simulation run. It may  
take a number of simulation runs to establish whether or not there is any  
impact—we call this a sensitivity analysis. Is the simulation output sensitive  
to a specific initial condition?  
‘One size fits all’  
There is a wide range of human shapes, behaviours and levels of fitness  
in the population. Some people may walk as a group, with children, be  
carrying bags, have varying degrees of mobility, be more \(or less\) aware of  
their surroundings. There are many variables to consider when building  
and using a crowd simulation. Most of these human factors \(variables\)  
are ignored due to the problem of testing all combinations \(where in the  
crowd is the little old person—at the front or at the back?\) and the inevi-  
table cost of performing these tests. As a result, simulations only really  
\*  
Too many unknown elements, parameters and interactions in the system to facilitate math-  
ematical analysis. 100 Introduction to crowd science  
test a very limited set of crowd variables, generally using a single size of  
character.  
There is a second—and more dangerous—element in crowd simulations,  
which is related to packing density \(the number of computer-generated  
characters that can occupy the computer equivalent of the space\). The  
computer needs to process the shapes of the characters and the individual  
calculations for overtaking and passing \(one- and two-way crowd flows\).  
There are many layers of calculations, both for the crowd dynamic and the  
graphics, in a display of a crowd on the computer screen. This complexity  
is dealt with by way of simplification. One such simplification is to move  
the computer-generated crowd as if it is moving on a chessboard, from  
square to square. This limits the packing density in the simulation. Because  
of this kind of simplification \(limiting packing density to, say, 6.25 people  
per square metre\), those simulations will never show the crowd at risk of  
increased pressure and crushing \(which occurs at 7–10 people per square  
metre\). The limits to some crowd simulations can be dangerously mislead-  
ing, for example, where a density-limited simulation is applied to assess  
risks in an environment where the crowd may exceed the simulation’s limit.  
The simulation shows that ‘all is good’, when a real crowd could develop  
substantial crowd pressure and significant risk to life and limb. This has  
occurred at least twice, to our knowledge \(Jamarat Bridge 2006 and Love  
Parade 2010\), resulting in mass fatalities.  
A crowd simulation applied to this kind of risk analysis—without knowl-  
edge or understanding of sensitivity analysis, with no one to challenge the  
inputs or outputs, and with no voice of experience in the process \(i.e. peo-  
ple with real crowd management experience\)—can be fatal. The continued  
blind use and application of computer simulations will inevitably lead to  
further problems. Simulations can look very realistic, but they are only as  
good as the rules within the underlying models, assumptions, computations  
and formulae.  
Using a crowd simulation  
In general, when used correctly, simulations have two main purposes\: to  
prove or disprove a potential feature or characteristic of an event, or to  
provide some insight into the nature of an event. When simulating crowds,  
the psychologist may test the sensitivity of certain variables—for example,  
by increasing the aggression level for a character in a conflict situation.  
This would have no real-life parallel as one cannot measure aggression in  
individuals, or how it may change in a conflict or crisis situation and affect  
others. As such, this kind of modelling may have no practical applications,  
but it could provide valuable research insights into the relationship of \(say\)  
aggression and conflict resolution options. As previously outlined, scien-  
tific tools are used by scientists for the purpose of scientific study, to test Crowd science 101  
hypotheses and explore the sensitivity of the outcome in relation to the ini-  
tial assumptions. Valuable academic research, but, as with any safety criti-  
cal engineering discipline, these simulations need to be properly validated,  
with real crowds, before they could be used to prove a safety case.  
Simulations are based on a set of assumptions, and some \(not all\) of those  
assumptions may be tested and explored in a simulation run. Whether  
there is a tangible output or not, the exploration of assumptions relating to  
crowds can provide valuable insights. In our own research, we have found  
many interesting phenomena using simulations—some good, some useful,  
some interesting, some bad and some dangerous.  
APPLICATIONS OF A CROWD SIMULATION  
Over the last 25 years, we have worked with architects, site designers and  
transportation and structural engineers who were familiar with the limita-  
tions of simulations. At the same time, the crowd managers—the people  
who may benefit most from the uses and applications of crowd dynam-  
ics simulations—neither understood the data nor believed the results. This  
disbelief was a significant cause for concern in our work. Over the years  
of teaching the principles and applications of crowd modelling, the same  
questions relating to simulation credibility were asked time and again. We  
do not understand this? What does this report mean? We do not think this  
is right? It does not look like a real crowd!  
Furthermore, when we reviewed the historical database of accidents  
and incidents, we realised that causality had some common features, but  
near misses were not documented and there was a lack of understanding of  
crowd dynamics throughout the industry. This was common to incidents  
around the world. That was the missing link, the information the crowd  
managers knew and the computer programmers did not comprehend. That  
was why the simulations did not look real!  
An untapped wealth of information and experience exists in the minds of  
the crowd managers, and their experience had to be collated in a structured  
and accessible manner to make it useful and improve crowd safety across  
the industry. Typically, the experienced crowd managers were not program-  
mers, scientists or expert computer users; we could not use computer sys-  
tems to capture and disseminate that experience.  
Simulation versus experience  
We knew that, owing to the restrictions of computation and graphics capa-  
bilities, there are a number of programming shortcuts necessary to produce  
a reasonable model, and the computer programmers only knew these short-  
cuts. When crowd managers challenged the outputs of computer models, 102 Introduction to crowd science  
they were baffled by the science. These results were, indeed, very clever  
models, but they had little to do with reality. Crowd managers would bring  
simulation video outputs to the workshops, pointing out their concerns.  
These two groups—the computer scientists and the crowd managers—were  
not collaborating.  
We observed a growing distrust of crowd simulations from the crowd  
managers, and a growing disdain—a dismissive attitude—from several  
crowd simulations developers towards the crowd managers, who were  
questioning their simulations. The proceedings from various conferences  
purported, in two major publications, theories of crowds, behaviour and  
reactions that were patently incorrect and would be dismissed as dangerous  
by the experienced crowd manager and crowd psychologist. The power of  
the technology grew, and the graphics capabilities became more realistic,  
but that masked a deeper and more worrying problem.  
Graphics, not physics  
Photorealistic, human-like characters in the movies \(Avatar, for example\)  
and on the computer screen are an illusion. In the mind of the viewer if it  
looks like a human and moves like a human, then it surely has all the attri-  
butes of a human. That was the core of the problem in simulating crowds\:  
computer scientists were trying to emulate the way they believed crowds  
behaved. Crowd managers were seeing the simulations and saying, ‘That’s  
not how a real crowd behaves!’  
There is no value to spending tens of thousands of pounds \(or dollars\)  
on simulations if the results are neither used nor trusted. People with real  
crowd experience need to be integrated into the development process; oth-  
erwise, the scientist is in an isolated and unrealistic world. With such a gulf  
among the programmers, scientists and end users, a fundamental question  
kept coming up in the workshops\: were these crowd simulations reliable?  
Were they ‘fit for purpose’ when used to prove an environment is safe for  
the crowds, for assessing crowd safety? To simplify this complex problem,  
we need to explain more about the limits to a simulation.  
Limits to simulations  
To understand certain aspects of a system it helps to simplify that system as  
much as possible, and to include only those properties and characteristics  
that are essential for understanding the system under study. A simulation  
incorporates only those elements that influence the behaviour under study.  
If, for example, you want to understand how an object falls, you can conduct  
experiments by dropping different types of objects and measuring how fast  
they fall. From these studies, you can construct a formula \(a model of how  
fast an object will fall\). This formula predicts how all other objects will fall. Crowd science 103  
From this you can build a computer simulation—a computer model of  
falling objects \(physics\) based on your formula. It is important to note that  
in this process you do not concern yourself with whether the object is new  
or old, red or green, has odour or not. You focus on just two key properties\:  
the experimental results and your formula \(or model\). For a falling object,  
there are just two parameters\: time and the gravitational force. That is all  
you need to know in order to produce a very good model of how objects  
will fall. Just two parameters! All objects will fall at the same rate; the  
speed at which they hit the ground is a function of the time they fall, which  
relates to their initial height when they are dropped. All objects accelerate  
under the gravitation force at a predictable rate. The model is, to a scientist,  
a simple formula.  
Physics, not graphics  
A computer simulation is written using a series of mathematical recipes  
called algorithms. These recipes need to be based on some numerical for-  
mulae that can predict the property you want to study—for example, how  
objects fall. Two parameters determine the time it takes for all objects to  
fall\: the initial height and the gravitational constant. We can then use that  
basic model to determine the speed at which the object will hit the ground,  
and from that we can calculate how high an object may bounce, and for  
that we need to know something about the properties of a falling object. We  
can also determine whether or not air resistance will affect the size of the  
object. For example, although a tonne of coal may fall as fast as a tonne of  
feathers, the surface area of the tonne of feathers will be much larger and  
may be affected by the density of the air. And so it goes, we start with a  
simple model, mass and acceleration, and we add parameters to this as we  
dig deeper into the system under scrutiny. The more we need to understand  
about the phenomena under scrutiny, the more complex the model becomes.  
You can use a falling body formula without a computer and it will work  
equally well.\* If you need to produce a graphical display of objects falling,  
you suddenly need to consider the display elements, such as colour, texture,  
lighting, how the object may rotate during its fall and many other proper-  
ties. You may need to programme a background, its lighting, other objects,  
their lighting and texture \(rendering\) to make your simulation look more  
realistic to the viewer.  
It takes a lot more effort to perfect the display characteristics of an object  
falling than it might to understand the basic physics of the falling object.  
\*  
At least it has been done since the time of Galileo Galilei \(1564–1642\), who defied centuries  
of tradition and demonstrated his theory that two objects of different mass, when dropped,  
would hit the ground at the same time. The principles were always true, but it took an  
experiment to prove it! 104 Introduction to crowd science  
The phenomena is physics, the display is graphics; it is important to dif-  
ferentiate between these two as the end user can be easily fooled. Great  
graphics and poor/bad physics may look convincing to the eye, but they  
may be completely wrong!  
The processes of modelling \(understanding how things work\) and simu-  
lations \(testing how things work\) are very different to rendering an image  
on a computer screen. This is why it takes so long to produce an animated  
movie; there is a lot of time and effort required to create all the visual ele-  
ments to make them appear realistic.  
VALIDATION  
The physics of falling objects can be tested. We can test objects to the point  
of destruction; we can drop a glass, a vase, a piece of fruit and so forth,  
in fact, we can drop many objects in order to validate our model of fall-  
ing objects. Obviously, we cannot test a crowd to destruction, nor can we  
measure such intangible elements as mood, aggression or reactions. There  
are many such behavioural and psychological limits to understanding the  
individual, and the crowd may never be validated in the same way we can  
validate other engineering disciplines.  
Complex simulations  
As we develop an understanding of the object under scrutiny, we eliminate  
the things that needlessly complicate matters. This simplification process is  
called modelling; mathematicians sometimes call these ‘toy’ models. In this  
context, ‘toy’ means the simple analysis of something that is understood  
to be much more complicated. You can present a model as an actual repre-  
sentation of the system under scrutiny on a computer screen \(simulation\),  
or as a mathematical relationship \(e.g. a flow rate calculation\). Then, as  
you wish to know more and more about any phenomenon, or as the phe-  
nomenon becomes more and more complex, you need increasingly elabo-  
rate equations, increasingly detailed programming and you end up with a  
computerised simulation that is hard to understand. The more complex the  
object you are studying, the more complex the models need to be in order  
to establish the underlying behaviour. This process is necessary to both  
understanding and predicting outcomes.  
When to use a simulation  
We can make the following general observations about the simulation  
approach\: Crowd science 105  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A simulation is most appropriate when the problem is too complex to  
solve using another method.  
A process such as random-number procedures must be employed to  
generate values for the probabilistic components of the model.  
A book-keeping procedure must be developed to keep track of what is  
happening in the simulation process.  
Because of the numerous calculations required in most simulations, a  
computer programme or simulator is required.  
The simulation process must be conducted for many days or periods  
in order to establish the long-run averages for the decision alternatives  
or other changes in the system.  
Through a series of experiments with the simulation, good values may be  
selected for the key design parameters of the system. This places the empha-  
sis on using a computer, and on the user having the ability to alter the initial  
parameters in a simulation and to test the outcome. The greater the number  
of parameters, the longer it will take to test them all.  
Least possible simulation  
The scientist would call the simplest model of a system a ‘least possible  
simulation’ \(LPS\), whereas a ‘full’ simulation gains in complexity faster  
than the simulated object does, and the simulation eventually catches up  
with the phenomenon. Plus the time and effort required in creating a realis-  
tic graphical representation of the object under study. The principles of LPS  
were established years ago and the science is called Information Theory.  
A simulations have less information than the system you are claiming to  
simulate. You need to understand a lot about the system you are simulating;  
you need to support validation with real-world measurements. Which begs  
a simple and direct question of a simulation vendor\: how much do we know  
about human behaviour? The answer is not a lot!  
Understanding human behaviour  
Crowd managers had experienced a much wider range of human behav-  
iours than the computers were capable of simulating. A further problem  
related to obtaining test data for crowds, as there was such a wide range of  
behaviours and variables. Returning to the falling-object model, we drop  
objects to develop a model \(a formula\), and then we can use that model to  
predict the behaviour of a different object and hence refine our model. To  
understand crowd risk and make appropriate measurements of risk reac-  
tions, we would need to study the crowd in a risky situation. This is neither  
ethical nor practical, so our crowd studies and subsequent crowd models 106 Introduction to crowd science  
are based on assumptions, on the few CCTV observations of risk-related  
crowd behaviour. These models are incomplete at best.  
Getting back to basics  
To get back to our original research objectives, a new approach was  
required. We had been using simulations to gain valuable insight into the  
nature and interactions of crowd movements in built and complex spaces,  
but in order to develop a more appropriate risk analysis methodology for  
the design and management of places of public assembly, a simpler, noncom-  
puter-based approach was required. What was needed was a set of tools that  
allowed others to understand the nature, problem and components of risk  
as it related to crowd safety. Modelling—not simulations—would provide  
the methodologies and tools for the people who manage crowds. Models  
are different to simulations in that we can construct a framework, an empty  
template, in which we can capture vital information and communicate it  
to others. One important element of this process is to provide a record of  
information in a form that others can read and understand, to prevent an  
event relying on the experience of one individual.  
The main reason for this change in approach was the fact that the events  
industry \(worldwide\) has had many close calls and near misses. Incidents  
that had the potential to become mass fatalities were simply not recorded.  
Unlike any other engineering practice, there were few standards.  
SUMMARY  
With little or no standard of competency for risk analysis and risk  
­ management, and with the events industry operating on a minimum budget  
for maximum return, there were significant limitations to improving stan-  
dards. The first of which is that no one wants to publicly state, ‘Phew! We  
were lucky that time!’ So information that was important to the process of  
improving crowd safety was not being captured. As a result, safety systems  
were not improving, and—as we have discovered over the last decade—the  
same mistakes were being made over and over again as experienced indi-  
viduals left their posts to move to other events, and the replacement crowd  
manager had to relearn processes and procedures, what worked and what  
did not work. Some safety systems required investment but may provide no  
immediate return on that investment. Furthermore, with no legal require-  
ment for adequate training, infrastructure or safety systems, the indus-  
try had no incentive to change. The challenge was to produce a low-cost,  
easy-to-implement methodology that operators could use with minimum  
training. It needed to be useful, informative and practical. In other words,  
crowd and event models—not computer-generated crowd simulations. Crowd science 107  
The task was defining itself\: to take the tacit \(experiential\) information  
from the crowd managers and turn it into an easy-to-understand model.  
This process is called ‘codification’; turning knowledge and experience into  
guidance, learning and the codes of best practice. Just as the computer pro-  
grammers struggled to understand the behaviour and dynamics of crowds,  
the crowd managers could not express their tacit knowledge \(experience\)  
into computer code. During the workshops, we heard many stories of  
similar incidents of ‘almost a disaster’ and we collated these in the search  
for more appropriate modelling techniques for crowd risk analysis and to  
develop better models of crowds and events.  
Fortunately, there was a wealth of existing techniques that could be  
mapped into the event industry. For example, matrix analysis \(a technique  
of evaluating two independent sets of variables\), flow diagrams to evalu-  
ate conflicted spaces, risk mapping and the dynamics of how and where  
spaces are used\: these all exist in the broad science of operations research  
\(the study of optimising certain manufacturing processes and engineering  
systems\). We could model crowds and events. Modelling is a very differ-  
ent process to simulation; simulations are based on models, but could we  
model crowds and events without needing to simulate them? Chapter 5  
# Crowd and event modelling  
Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and  
confusion of things. As the world, which to the naked eye exhibits the  
greatest variety of objects, appears very simple in its internal constitu-  
tion when surveyed by a philosophical understanding, and so much the  
simpler by how much the better it is understood.

INTRODUCTION  
A model is the simple representation of a complex process. Models contain  
the key elements of a system under study, and most good models begin with  
the modeller breaking down a complex process into a series of parts. These  
parts should be focussed on one or two issues and not be overly complex.  
Models should be simple to construct, simple to visualise, simple to manip-  
ulate and they should communicate the key elements of the model to both  
the modeller and other interested parties. In the context of crowd science,  
the models we develop are aimed towards understanding crowd risks; they  
should assist in identifying those risks with the aim of eliminating, reduc-  
ing, mitigating or managing them.  
In this chapter, we will cover the principles Fruin outlined for major  
design projects, and then we will look at specific tools we have developed,  
dedicated to crowd risk analysis and safety engineering for typical event  
planning and crowd management projects. For all of these projects, it may  
be necessary to define a crowd management plan. That process we define  
within the overall scope of crowd risk analysis and safety engineering.  
109 110 Introduction to crowd science  
THE CROWD MANAGEMENT PLAN  
You cannot develop a safe, robust crowd management plan without some  
form of crowd modelling \(i.e. some idea of how the crowd will behave at  
your event/venue\). Equally, you cannot keep a crowd safe without some  
form of crowd monitoring \(of arrival flow rates, how the queues build  
up, areas of high crowd density and different types of crowd behaviour,  
both normal and emergency\). Fruin defined the process in a flow chart  
\(in Pedestrian Planning and Design, 1971\) and it has proven to be a  
robust model for the process of systematically reviewing complex major  
projects.  
Major project analysis  
The key to good model building is in using a range of modelling tech-  
niques—and understanding the limitations of each specific technique. As  
previously outlined, unless you have expertise in crowd simulations, cau-  
tion is advised—especially if you believe one tool, one software system,  
one methodology or one technique can be used to solve all aspects of large  
complex events. If you build models for a major event \(such as an Olympics  
event\), you need to be aware of your simulation’s limits.  
The good, bad and crazy  
We have seen many bad modelling tools, built on poor or bad assumptions.  
We have seen some tools that produce dangerous and misleading outputs,  
which have subsequently been used to justify substandard event plans. We  
have also presented so many, inadequate crowd management plans and  
neglected event risk assessments that we have developed and run a course  
for the UK Police and Institute of Licensing \(IoL\), focussed on major events,  
subtitled ‘How to spot a cr\*p event plan’ and are never short of materials  
for that course.  
During the initial project definition for the Jamarat Bridge, we were pre-  
sented with over 5000 submissions, project ideas, concepts and proposals.  
We found it very simple to divide those into three piles, the good, the bad  
and the crazy.  
Modelling complex events  
We shall first explore a major project using the Fruin flow chart, and out-  
line the process involved for modelling large events. Then we will refine  
the process for smaller events. By large we mean events in the hundreds of  
thousands, by smaller we mean events in the tens, hundreds or a few thou-  
sand people attending. Crowd and event modelling 111  
First, you cannot hope to capture all the aspects of a complex dynamic  
environment and all the potential human factors are involved throughout  
the event. Any consultant/programmer who claims otherwise is deluded, or  
lying. Common sense tells you that any attempt to model the full scope of  
an event, and all its potential aspects and outcomes, would involve first cap-  
turing all the elements that may have an influence on that event. This would  
include all the possible human factors. We have highlighted the nature of  
this problem as intractable \(too many variables, too many unknowns and  
too many possible outcomes\). We stress that complete event modelling, in a  
single framework, is both flawed and analytically intractable.  
To illustrate this specific point, imagine this scenario\: it is the day of the  
event; it is sunny and warm. An individual wakes up after a good night’s  
sleep, gets on a train and makes their way to the event. That individual  
may not be behaving, moving, thinking, reacting in the same way if it were  
raining/if there were transport delays/if they had had a bad night’s sleep.  
Many factors may influence human behaviour. We are all different and our  
moods and behaviour are irrevocably linked to our environment and our  
experiences. The question is how many of these human factors will affect  
the overall crowd behaviour at an event? How many of these elements do  
we need to know of when modelling and planning for a major event?  
We outlined these problems in Chapter 4, but we stress that individual  
frustration, aggression and mood in general are potentially influenced by  
external factors, and hence so is crowd behaviour.  
Who goes first?  
We have noted that the order of people in the system may be significant \(the  
little old lady factor outlined in the previous chapter\). For example, three  
people in a row who have all had a very bad morning. How could this order  
affect overall crowd behaviour if there is a sudden change in the environ-  
ment—say, a person suddenly stopping, tripping or falling? There are so  
many unknown factors that the problem of testing all of these, understand-  
ing whether any single factor could influence the overall crowd behaviour,  
is by definition, intractable.  
Some of these factors may be irrelevant; some may combine to produce a  
small group with raised anxiety or aggression that can influence the crowd’s  
behaviour. Some may have a wide area impact \(such as a delay on entry or  
a change in weather\). When behavioural simulations are used to explore  
these relationships, we can begin to understand the complexity of behav-  
ioural influences, but we may never be able to measure these influences. We  
may never be able to anticipate the impact of certain influences, and hence  
we may never be able to predict or mitigate their effects on the crowd. Even  
if we could, somehow, measure the influences, it would be a costly exercise  
and, as explained in Chapter 1, crowd safety is a low-cost industry. 112 Introduction to crowd science  
However, influencing crowd behaviour can help to mitigate many poten-  
tial risks. For example, designing free-flowing entry and exit systems will  
reduce the potential for frustration, and hence crushing, regardless of indi-  
vidual moods.  
MODELLING FOR A MAJOR PROJECT  
Modelling individuals, with the aim of predicting their behaviour, is fraught  
with complexity and should be treated with caution. Tools that allow the  
exploration of human factors may serve useful purposes in appropriate cir-  
cumstances, but these are expert tools and do not fit the majority of event  
safety requirements.  
A more practicable and sensible approach is to analyse the components  
that create an event, such as the entry system, exit system, front of stage  
and the like, treating each element with an appropriate modelling tool, and  
then examining the whole system. This is opposed to trying to model the  
whole system using one tool.  
The choice of tools and techniques is as important as understanding and  
defining the event. Figure 5.1 is by Fruin.\* To outline its application we will  
describe each heading, and then outline how modelling tools fit within the  
context of event planning and the development of a crowd management  
plan.  
Define the objectives  
Clearly, every event should begin with a set of objectives—perhaps a desired  
result, a particular performer, raising awareness of a cause and so on. These  
objectives may include the scope, nature and ultimate aims of the event.  
We then need to understand the event site, its capacity, access and egress  
routes, the transportation infrastructure and the site constraints under dif-  
ferent weather conditions. There are a number of key questions related to  
this initial analysis, such as\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Why are the crowd coming to this event?  
How will they get there?  
How quickly can we process people into the event?  
How quickly can they leave \(normal and emergency considerations\)?  
Does the performer have a large following?  
Does the performer/celebrity use social media to inform his/her fans  
of a free event \(such as a book signing\)?

Figure 5.1  Fruin—flow chart of the process for evaluating a pedestrian planning project.  
These are all important, and often neglected, questions relating to choice  
of performer or celebrity at free events. The event/site capacity is only one  
aspect of site suitability. The fundamental questions should be\: ‘Is this site  
suitable for this event?’ and ‘Is there sufficient ingress/egress and site capac-  
ity for this crowd?’  
When we work on major projects, all of the stages described below  
would be considered. From a consulting, modelling and potential client  
perspective, this flow chart, developed by Fruin, is a useful guide for crowd  
modelling.  
Data collection  
During the initial stages of a project, we would typically collate a wide  
range of photographs, CAD plans and information about the site. We would  
interview the organisers and other agencies \(police, security, architect, etc.\)  
to understand the key components of the event. If it is a major event we may 114 Introduction to crowd science  
well run a site workshop with a multiagency team, gathering a wide range  
of scenarios in order to build as much information as possible. On any proj-  
ect, it is important to devote time to gathering the appropriate information;  
again, the experience of what can be modelled and what techniques should  
be used on a specific project is invaluable. By spending time on data collec-  
tion and collation, you can assess which tools/techniques are most suitable  
for that specific project. There is no point in using a sledgehammer to crack  
a walnut; use the tools as appropriate and always, wherever possible, walk  
the site to gather local information that may not be available on maps,  
plans or diagrams.  
Analysis  
Analysis of the data is typically performed using a wide range of  
resources. This may be a review of the transport data, the capacity and  
frequency of trains. Head counting on any existing videos of the event  
can help assess crowd flow rate. Images/photographs and density analy-  
sis can help assess potential risks. Distribution analyses \(which routes  
do the crowds take to get to the event?\) are also helpful. There are many  
other aspects of crowd management and crowd control that may need  
to be considered for major events\: data analysis is often 80% of a major  
project—in other words, it can take 80% of your time to collect, col-  
late and analyse the relevant data. Developing crowd management plans,  
event plans and site plans takes time—but the objective is to assess the  
issues around crowd safety, and to do that you need to collect and collate  
as much data as possible.  
Contingency plans/simulations  
A simulation may help to assess congestion at an event with multiple  
entry/exit points. We would use a range of potential tools—some we have  
designed ourselves for specific risk analysis, others that are commercially  
available \(CAD, area and distance measuring tools\). It is important to note  
that running one type of simulation may not be enough to study many  
types of high-density pedestrian environments. Often we may need to test  
the extremes \(pedestrians not moving/all pedestrians moving\) to discover  
the ‘solution space’ of a problem. This is a reality check, and it provides us  
with a benchmark for further modelling techniques. One such technique is  
called ‘extreme value analysis’—where the worst possible cases may need  
to be explored.  
By considering the extremes, we can represent the conditions in which  
the risks of crowd injury may be anticipated. They can then be assessed,  
and remedial actions applied to mitigate them. These extremes may rep-  
resent two different types of management strategy \(low-density risks and Crowd and event modelling 115  
high-density risks\); it is important to formulate a contingency plan for both  
extremes. Models can assist us in both understanding a specific scenario \(as  
it develops\) and planning the appropriate crowd management strategy, pro-  
cess and procedures. The use of simulations in this context is to understand  
modes of failure. How could the risks develop, in which areas, over what  
period, and how long may a hazardous condition last? We must stress the  
difference between this process testing a system to understand how it may  
fail, and one that confirms a site is OK for use.  
By testing the extreme conditions, for example, no-one moving, crowds  
building up, rates of flow, everyone moving, trips/falls and so forth, we are  
reasonably confident of having contingency planned for the worst-case sce-  
narios. It is important to always test the plan and strategy for 200–1000%  
more people arriving over a shorter period than expected. This will test the  
robustness of the plan and the management process in case of larger crowds.  
Presentations/approval  
It is important to note that any issues relating to crowd safety may involve a  
range of agencies \(police, civil defence, architects, medical, waste manage-  
ment, security forces, etc.\) and that the presentation of plans/suggestions  
should be clearly understood by all parties. Given the language differences  
in the many countries in which we work, we have adopted a graphic pre-  
sentation\* technique to highlight potential crown problems, using line dia-  
grams, risk maps and decision support tools.  
Design phase  
Many elements of the design can change between plan and build. We are  
specifically concerned about the amount of information that is typically  
missing during the early stages of build—mostly involving the management  
and operations procedures. We are often presenting to the operations and  
management team during the build phase of projects. This allows us to act  
as a communications conduit for both the design and operations groups  
working on complex places of public assembly. For major events, such as  
planning for the Royal Wedding in 2011, a continual review process and  
risk analysis, were subject to weekly meetings and project review.  
Simulations/approval  
We test a wide range of issues relating to the design; often these tests  
are subject to approval by the operators, so we run workshops to facil-  
itate understanding of the various models and simulation results. It is  
\*  
We will illustrate these in Chapter 6. 116 Introduction to crowd science  
not enough to run a model and assume that all parties will understand  
it and be able to adopt a suitable operational procedure. We strongly  
advise that the process of modelling/simulation currently used should be  
checked independently, a model builder could be caught in their own little  
world and fail to spot obvious errors. Writing an operational/procedural  
manual must be a continual process during the construction phases of  
large complex spaces.  
Operations manual  
If a simulation is necessary, the process of creating and running a simula-  
tion allows a skilled operator to assess a wide range of contingency con-  
ditions. It is advised that modelling and operational procedures run as a  
joint project. The development of an integrated management response team  
improves crowd safety and is a common feature of large-scale events \(such  
as the Olympics\) worldwide. These involve multiagency teams \(police,  
medical, civil defence, waste management, security forces, etc.\). We have  
extensive experience of running and facilitating workshops of this type.  
The process involves educational materials, examples of similar sites,  
near misses and data capture. By coupling teaching/training within the  
consulting project, we can achieve a number of improvements. It is essential  
that the operation teams are integrated into the process, not left to ‘man-  
age’ the situation after the consultant has left the building.  
This was the key concern we highlighted in Chapter 1, that the opera-  
tional teams, the crowd managers, were not involved in the planning stages.  
Continuous revision process  
It is important to maintain a continuous process of modelling, simula-  
tion and writing/testing operational procedures to ensure the operational  
efficiency and crowd safety during the build phase of large complex envi-  
ronments. We have outlined the basis of our data analysis and initial con-  
clusions; one additional element is to evaluate the potential for an incident  
from a timeline analysis of previous incidents around the world. Learning  
from other people’s mistakes is a good way to prevent these from occurring  
at your own events.  
Fruin’s flow chart is typically used for large-event consultancy projects\:  
collecting information, processing it, testing a range of scenarios and then  
developing an event plan, a safety concept and a crowd management plan.  
By illustrating the stages we would adopt for major projects, you can adopt  
all, or part, of this process as required. Most events do not have all of the  
complexity of a major event so a simpler process can be applied. You can  
apply the elements defined in the Fruin’s flow chart to any scale of event, and  
it serves as a checklist for the entire event planning process. The objective, as Crowd and event modelling 117  
we continue to stress, is to understand the crowds risks in the specific event  
under scrutiny.  
The Fruin flow chart is a robust model and, as a checklist for a client  
and a consultant, it outlines the basic principles of the planning around  
the crowd. It applies to events in general terms, but the event has some  
unique characteristics which we can define in the context of building a  
risk assessment.  
WHAT IS AN EVENT MODEL?  
An event is a place where people gather to participate in and/or enjoy a per-  
formance. The crowd component of an event is simple to express\: the crowd  
enters a space, venue or arena \(ingress\), then it typically moves around that  
space \(circulation\) and finally it leaves that space \(egress\). Every event con-  
sists of these three phases, albeit for very different durations.  
As the crowd moves towards the event or venue, there are sets of expecta-  
tions that influence its behaviour \(about how to enter the venue, for exam-  
ple\). Those expectations change once inside the event/venue \(as members of  
the crowd try to find, for instance, their seat or the best position, or locate  
the toilets/bar/merchandising\). Finally, as the crowd leaves, another set of  
expectations is experienced\: ‘How do I get out of here?’ So in broad terms,  
for the purposes of defining a standard model or template, we have three  
primary phases \(expectations\) of crowd behaviour\: ingress—circulation—  
egress \(ICE\).  
From research into past accidents and incidents, we can determine causal-  
ity of major incidents as having three primary influences. Design can influ-  
ence crowd behaviour, for example, if the number of people trying to enter  
an event space over a period exceeds the capacity of that system. In this  
way queuing, pressure and potentially crushing can develop on an entry  
system. Design is therefore a primary influence on crowd safety. The second  
influence on crowd behaviour can be defined as information. Elements such  
as signage, public address \(PA\) systems and media \(websites, Twitter feeds,  
news items, press releases, maps, plans, diagrams, rumours, weather changes  
and so on\) can influence crowd behaviour. The third influence is the man-  
agement system; how the event is managed, how it operates on the day, the  
process and procedures, the monitoring and recording of crowd movements,  
risk and safety measures. So we can map these as the design, information  
and management aspects \(DIM\) that can influence crowd behaviour.  
The template of the primary phases of crowd behaviour \(ingress, cir-  
culation, egress\) and the primary influences on crowd behaviour \(design,  
information and management\) lends itself to the acronym DIM-ICE, which  
sounds like ‘demise’, and is hence a subtle reminder of the consequences  
of failing to understand crowd risk and crowd safety! For our model, we 118 Introduction to crowd science  
also need to consider two primary modes of crowd behaviour, for both  
normal and emergency situations. There are potentially many different  
types of emergency, and how the crowd might react to each will need to  
be understood. This is an important aspect of the modelling process; how-  
ever, despite the many different types of potential threats there are only a  
few types of reaction to those threats—to move away from the threat or  
move towards it \(to assist others\), or to stay put and do nothing. We will  
address these elements when we outline the modelling approach to emer-  
gency behaviour and crowd reactions.\*  
Event characteristics  
The need for a standardised approach to event modelling developed out  
of the common misconception that all events are unique. There are, of  
course, differences from event to event, but there are also many similari-  
ties. By focussing on these similarities, we have developed a range of tools  
that provides the ability to both capture and share best practices with all  
parties involved in event organisation. More specifically, we can capture  
information that relates to near misses, event risks and the crowd dynamic.  
We use this to collate best practices from around the world. We reviewed  
the process we had developed to produce simulation; it had all the key  
components necessary to address the modelling problem. We use these  
tools to collect and collate information, to model the crowd risks at events.  
DIM-ICE meta-modelling  
The first of these tools is a meta-model; a template for events that focusses  
the user’s attention on the time-related element of crowd risks. It is a uni-  
versal template for crowds attending any event, anywhere in the world.  
Although that claim may sound grandiose, this is nothing more than a struc-  
ture—an empty template that assists the user in collecting and displaying  
information in such a way that the details highlight the unique features \(or  
similarities\) of the event and the site characteristics. We originally designed  
this to capture information for major consulting projects, specifically dur-  
ing the work in Saudi Arabia where language and cultural differences made  
documents difficult to read and fully understand. By structuring an event  
into times \(ICE\) and taking the causes of major incidents from the database  
records, we can develop the template.  
This template is used for different types of events as a planning tool for  
the organisers and as a checklist for safety inspectors and event licensing.  
\*  
There are only four options\: total evacuation, directed evacuation, phased \(partial\) evacu-  
ation or stay-put \(shelter in place\). We cover this in more detail in Chapter 8. Crowd and event modelling 119  
It allows the user to compare and contrast different performers at the same  
venue, or different venues with the same performer. It allows users to cap-  
ture and structure information and facilitates a consistent approach to  
crowd risk analysis and crowd safety applications.  
Phases and influences  
The template relates the phases of an event and the influences of the envi-  
ronment on crowd behaviour. This provides a framework for evaluating  
how crowds may react under normal and emergency situations. It is a  
matrix analysis that, when populated, defines the crowd issues for a specific  
site or event, and the risk associated with each phase \(ICE\).  
Figure 5.2 shows the DIM-iCE template for events, this is a blank tem-  
plate which can be on a word process or spreadsheet, and begins with a  
blank space to capture the event characteristics. For example, how does  
ingress-design, function? Does the system use barriers, gates or turnstiles?  
What is the throughput?  
Typically, we would populate this template with a brief description and/  
or value \(people per hour\) to provide a reference table for the event infor-  
mation. Then we would colour that box red, orange or green to highlight  
any risks associated with that specific element of the template \(Examples of  
this, in colour, are shown on this webpage\: http\://www.gkstill.com/Support/  
WhyModel/dimice.html\).  
Why develop a matrix approach?  
The original reason for collating data in this way was to capture informa-  
tion that may be specific to an event or site in a methodical and systematic  
Figure 5.2  The DIM-ICE meta-model template. The blank template allows the user to  
systematically work through the crowd behaviour phases and influences of  
an event. 120 Introduction to crowd science  
manner. We defined, from disaster database analysis, the primary risks  
noted from past disasters, the influences on crowd behaviour—namely the  
design influences \(capacity, area, building, barriers, etc.\)—the informa-  
tion influences \(media, PA systems, etc.\) and the management influences.  
The reason for this is to focus our attention \(and that of anyone using this  
information\) on the areas that have been identified as the distal causes in  
crowd-related accidents and incidents. Colouring the specific grid/box red,  
if that particular element for that event had some specific risk, ensured we  
highlighted the risk in the most visual manner possible. This helps identify  
the phase of the crowd behaviour and the potential influence on crowd  
behaviour, highlighting the risks to the crowd.  
Matrix analysis  
Using a matrix such as the DIM-ICE meta-model, we can apply analytical  
techniques for tactical and strategic responses to crowd-related issues. That  
means we lay the information out in a tabular format \(a 3  
×  
3 grid\). Values  
such as cost, risk, flow rates and so forth can be assigned to each grid and this  
can provide a useful insight into the best use and deployment of resources.  
The matrix approach not only focusses attention on key elements of  
time-related risks—it also highlights what most crowd management plans  
fail to address\: that incidents can occur during ingress, mid-event and dur-  
ing egress. Typically, an event plan will only focus on emergencies during  
an event, yet the disaster database highlights that the majority of crowd  
accidents occur either during ingress or egress.  
It is important to stress that these are neither complicated nor time-consuming  
techniques; we have developed and taught this approach over  
many years, and found that the adage ‘keep it simple’ is not only a truism  
but also a necessity.  
Flow path analysis  
Another important concept for event modelling, which we introduced in  
the PhD thesis and later developed into a data capture and analysis tech-  
nique for major events, is that of crowd flow paths or routes. We outlined  
this as part of the computer code for the original crowd simulation system  
using the following definitions\:  
Least effort\: It is defined as the ‘easiest’ path that individuals take as they  
progress through their environment. This can be reduced to two simple  
algorithmic rules\:  
1\. Individuals will take the shortest available route to get from source  
to destination. Where the ‘shortest’ is defined by shortest time \(which  
may not be the shortest distance\), an individual may walk around a Crowd and event modelling 121  
high-density crowd to reach their objective in less time than it takes to  
walk through the high-density crowd.  
2\. Individuals try to move at their normal speed \(if they can\), but will  
reduce their walking speed if the conditions dictate \(e.g. stairs, slopes,  
rough ground, congestion, navigating obstacles, etc.\). We illustrated  
this principle in Chapter 2 with the first string experiment.  
Focal routes\: A focal route is the shortest path \(i.e. that requiring the  
least effort\) an individual can take to reach their destination.  
Multiple path interference\: This occurs when two or more focal routes  
cross, where the crowds would converge, cross flow or counter flow. The  
multiple path interference principle developed into a methodology that  
we use to define areas that may have problems in high-density crowds. It  
became a core teaching principle for risk analysis in the complex and built  
spaces of major events.  
List of modelling techniques  
As outlined in previous chapters, we have a range of modelling techniques  
for crowd risk analysis and safety engineering. We generally use all of these  
techniques for both capturing and communicating event risks. Typically,  
we would work through a major event using the tools in this order\:  
1\. RAMP analysis  
2\. DIM-ICE meta-model  
3\. Matrix analysis techniques  
We will now provide a brief description of each of these techniques;  
then we will outline the detail and rationale behind this approach, and  
in Chapter 6, we will demonstrate how the techniques can be—and have  
been—applied to major events. For all of the aforementioned techniques,  
which are qualitative \(using description and diagrams\) rather than quanti-  
tative \(numerical\), we use the following colour coding\:  
•  
•  
•  
Red to indicate any areas where the crowd density may be five people  
per square metre or more. Red is the high-risk indicator.  
Orange to indicate any areas where the crowd is three to four people  
per square metre. Orange indicates medium risks to the crowds.  
Green to indicate any areas where the crowd density is two people per  
square metre or less. Green indicates low risks to the crowds.  
By using these three colours on a map, plan or diagram of the site, show-  
ing crowd movement and crowd risk, we keep the information simple.  
Maps can be developed for different times during the event, thus showing  
the dynamics of risk; for example, during ingress the crowd risks may be 122 Introduction to crowd science  
high at the entry points, but once the crowd is inside the event these risks  
no longer apply. Showing different risk maps for different times enables us  
to project the time, location and \(using colour\) severity of risks. This shows  
risk as a dynamic. It is a low-cost approach to event modelling and has  
proven to be both useful and easy to understand.  
RAMP ANALYSIS  
RAMP is an acronym for the Routes, Areas, Movement and Profile of the  
crowd at an event. Routes are the directions the crowds take to get to the  
site, move around the site and leave the site \(under both normal and emer-  
gency situations\), and are drawn on maps, plans or site diagrams to assist  
the visualisation of the crowds’ movements.  
Areas are the locations of crowd density \(low, medium and high\) and  
risks on the site relating to those locations. It also refers to the capacity of  
each section of the event \(such as the ingress and queuing areas\). Areas need  
to have both a numerical value \(square metres\) and a capacity \(number of  
people\), and we recommend a zone designation \(A, B, C, etc.\) for identifica-  
tion purposes during an event or an incident.  
Movement is the rate of passage through the various parts of the system,  
such as the rate at which crowds are processed through a ticket or search  
area. We represent movement using both line diagrams and a numerical  
value. We normally express movement according to how many people are  
expected and over what period. An example of this would be an arrival  
profile for a concert, fireworks display, football match and the like.  
Finally, profile is the known behaviour of the crowd—their age/demo-  
graphic, mix \(male/female ratio\), family group and others, and any intel-  
ligence that may assist in the management of the crowd.  
ROUTES  
This is the process in which the routes towards, around and leaving a  
site are defined as a series of overlays on a site map/plan or diagram. We  
use simple drawing techniques to facilitate understanding, and to docu-  
ment and plan normal and emergency resources. The technique is called  
‘BATNEEC’ \(best available technology, not entailing excessive cost\), and  
is the same as the first process we used when building computer models.  
It is essential for any computer system to input correct and relevant infor-  
mation. The principle of ‘garbage in  
=  
garbage out’ expresses the problem  
succinctly; if the quality of the information you put into a computer system  
is poor, the output will be poor. For risk and safety-critical systems this is,  
of course, an unacceptable situation. Crowd and event modelling 123  
To ensure we could input accurate and useful information, we had  
to develop a systematic approach to the input of that information. We  
developed a process of mapping the paths and areas of an event and  
converting them into computer code so that the simulation could func-  
tion. This meant we had to define the routes, areas, zones and options  
for the crowd, convert that into an algorithm \(a numerical recipe\) so the  
computer programme could use that information and run a simulation.  
We also had to develop systematic methods for converting information  
about all phases of the event \(ICE\). We did this by mapping site areas  
and routes, and building these maps up in layers, which helped us to  
understand the crowd issues, the pinch points, the movement over time  
and the dimensions of risk.  
We realised that the process had more value as an analytical tool than  
the computer programme, since the programme was only emulating the  
information we had input \(the routing maps, the areas and options\). We  
found, with a systematic approach to creating the necessary input for the  
computer programme, that we did not need to run the simulation in order  
to understand the risks. We could see the risks in our analysis and mapping  
process—in the layers of information, we developed for input. In addition,  
we could see any potential site problems in the process of turning that into  
an algorithm. We also realised we could teach this process, at low cost, to  
crowd managers; it has proven to be a very useful analytical process for  
assessing risk in large and complex events. We will describe the key ele-  
ments of this analytical approach to capturing key crowd and event infor-  
mation, and we will illustrate it with some examples. The process starts  
with a site plan, which must be large enough to include the points from  
which people may travel to reach the event.  
Ingress, circulation, egress  
First, we map the event ingress routes. An event will involve a series of  
routes \(directions of approach\), which may be from car park, transport  
terminal, local pubs/clubs, town centres or other population centres and  
others. We draw the routes on a sheet of baking paper laid over a site plan,  
using different colours to represent the concentration of crowds on the dif-  
ferent approach routes. An example is shown in Figure 5.3.  
Creating layers of information  
Then we take another sheet of baking paper\* and draw out the crowd  
movements, during ingress. Typically, we use red to indicate high volume  
\*  
We use the clear kind of baking paper—it costs less than the draftsman’s tracing sheet,  
comes in 10-m rolls and is available at the local high street supermarket. 124 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 5.3  Illustration of the distribution of crowd flow to an event, in this example,  
there is an 80–20% distribution. This helps the user plan resources and check  
during the event if the crowds are arriving as planned.  
of crowd flow \(80% or more of the population\), orange for medium crowd  
flow \(50%–80% of the crowd flow\) and green to indicate low crowd flow  
\(less than 50% of the population\). This helps define where the crowd man-  
agement resources may need to be assigned. Then we use another sheet of  
baking paper to draw out the routes for the circulation phase and then the  
egress phase of the event. Do not make the mistake of trying to put all the  
information on a single layer; you will end up in a mess.  
The materials are low cost for a reason\: if you make a mistake, you can  
throw a layer away and start again. Each layer should feature no more than  
the basic diagram, a title, your name and the date \(which helps in filing for  
later review\). In the example shown in Figure 5.3, the 80% line would be  
indicated in red and the 20% line indicated as green. We use the same colour  
convention, red, orange and green, for risk, flow and capacity. If a route or  
area is at less than 50% of its capacity, we indicate this in green; between  
50% and 80% is indicated in orange; and greater than 80% we indicate in  
red. This provides a visual indicator of how busy that route or area may be  
at that particular instant or location. Crowd and event modelling 125  
Adding layers  
The next layer\* maps out the crowd movement in an emergency during  
ingress. Again these are drawn as routes on the baking sheet placed over  
the site map \(it helps to mark the site plan corners so you can line your dia-  
grams up with the site map later\). The ‘normal’ ingress map and the ‘during  
emergency’ ingress map help us to assess the risks and formulate a strategy  
for crowd evacuation during the ingress process.  
For example, an emergency along the 80% route could give us some dif-  
ficulty, if we stop the crowds along that route, it could quickly build up into  
a high-density crowd. The people approaching may not know of the situa-  
tion ahead; as it is moving along a road with no means of diverting, there  
is potential for the crowd to reach crush-­ density. Hence, there is a potential  
risk in simply stopping this crowd. In the aforementioned example, one  
route has 80% of the approaching crowd, the other 20% of the approach-  
ing crowd. Each route has the same width so, with this diagram, we can see  
the potential problems if the crowd were to stop on either route. Clearly,  
the route with 80% of the crowd has less resilience and less space to handle  
an incident \(such as a medical emergency\). This can indicate that we need  
to provide different levels of management, monitoring and first respond-  
ers proportionately. The mapping process is a visual indicator \(the map,  
the road, the side roads, the 80% distribution, the length of the route, the  
direction, etc.\) of the anticipated situation. In one diagram, we represent  
many different types of information. This is an important aspect of crowd  
risk analysis as visualising risk helps identify duration, severity and loca-  
tion of those risks.  
As we previously stated, the process of drawing a line on a sheet of bak-  
ing paper \(a layer\) placed over a map can provide several valuable insights  
into the problems and solutions for a specific phase of an event. It is essen-  
tial to keep it simple\: ingress \(normal\) and then ingress \(emergency\), each  
on a separate layer. Putting too much on any one layer will obscure the  
information and may conceal some vital details on the map. By using bak-  
ing sheets, you can lift the layers and review the underlying map; if you  
were to draw on the map, you might cover over some of its detail.  
Inside the event  
For the circulation phase of the event, simply repeat the process with a new  
sheet of baking paper—this mapping the crowd movements inside the event  
space. For example, how will the crowd move from the entry points to other  
points around the site? These line diagrams, coupled with the colour-coded  
\*  
Use a new piece of baking sheet for each layer. 126 Introduction to crowd science  
indications of crowd concentration \(or distribution\), again provide valuable  
insights into the nature of the event and space utilisation.  
This type of exercise can be conducted as a group discussion or by indi-  
viduals; on many occasions, we have noted that delegates have seen risks  
when mapping crowd movements around the site—specifically the facilities  
planning, routes between stage and exits, toilets and bars—that they were  
previously unaware of.  
In general, if a map has many routes crossing, converging or going in  
opposite directions \(counter flows\) we can see that, at high density, those  
areas would have a higher risk. We can then take another sheet of baking  
paper and draw the emergency evacuation routes—again highlighting in  
red/orange/green those areas that may become higher density during an  
emergency egress, mid-event.  
Mapping egress  
Next, the egress maps need to be drawn \(these are the normal routes the  
crowd would take to leave the site\) and then we can consider an emergency  
during egress. For example, the crowd starts to leave and there is a problem  
in an exit corridor—say, a person falls over and we need to get to them  
quickly. By mapping the crowd flow, we can see that the crowd may hinder  
a quick response.  
By systematically mapping ingress, circulation and egress under both  
normal and emergency situations, and using low-cost materials and a little  
bit of time to think through the site, you will focus your attention on the  
time, location, severity and duration of crowd-related risks.  
This takes risk analysis from a single number \(as typically indicated in  
the conventional risk assessment\) into a visual map, and highlights the  
dynamic nature of crowd risks. The six maps \(ingress—normal and emer-  
gency; circulation—normal and emergency; and egress—normal and emer-  
gency\) should be included in the event plan so that the authorities that  
license/approve or grant permits for the event can understand the crowds’  
movements.  
We have seen hundreds—if not thousands—of event plans, but very few  
have contained these kinds of diagrams. It seems such an obvious and useful  
addition; we really do not understand why it is not a required element for  
an event—especially a major event. Figure 5.4 shows one of the circulation  
maps, we produced many of these, for each critical time period and each  
day of the olympics, featured in the work we did for crowd management  
and contingency planning workshops for the Sydney Olympics \(2000\).  
Once the delegates started using this process they found it useful and  
insightful, and continued to apply the technique for their event planning.  
We hope that once you have read this, you will apply the same methodology  
to your event plans and gain similar benefits. Crowd and event modelling 127

AREAS  
The route mapping process establishes the potential directions of crowd  
movement. These routes take the crowds into certain areas; we now need to  
map those areas, again using the baking sheet overlay process.  
To do this we need to calculate the area of the site, and there is a wide  
range of tools available for this process, including several good \(free\) map-  
ping and measuring tools on computers.  
Using the internet  
As a first-pass approximation,\* you can use an Internet satellite image or  
mapping tool for area calculations, such as Google Earth, MapInfo or  
Ordnance Survey† and the like. We typically use the computer to generate  
a map to an appropriate scale. There are also wide ranges of map measur-  
ing tools on the Internet, many are free to use and run on tablets,‡ PCs  
and Macs. We use those tools to estimate the site areas and for informa-  
tion gathering \(such as location of transportation hubs\). We have produced  
our own software to obtain all the critical dimensions from a variety of  
maps, plans and diagrams and perform the basic site calculations, such as  
\*  
A first-pass approximation helps define the order of magnitude of a solution. This is some-  
times called a ‘rough cut’ analysis.

and conditions.  
‡ A tablet can be a very useful device to view a site from the sky and ground during a site  
inspection. 128 Introduction to crowd science  
area, perimeter, entry route width, flow rates, fill times, site capacity  
and so forth. But these software tools are not simulations, merely map-  
ping and visualing tools, which provides the user with useful crowd flow  
information.  
We would then print the relevant site/event map and use the baking sheet  
to draw the routes and areas, using red/orange/green colours to highlight  
capacity and risk on different layers.  
Be aware that the scale of some mapping tools and site maps may not be  
accurate.\* This process is qualitative in nature and the objective is to assess  
risk as a first-pass approximation. Do not make the mistake of trying to do  
this on a computer. It is a pen and paper exercise to facilitate learning about  
the nature and dynamics of event risks.  
Dividing the area into zones  
We now need to subdivide the event area into sections that are static \(where  
the crowd is usually not moving\) and dynamic \(where the crowd is usually  
moving\). For example, static areas would be front-of-stage at a concert,  
queuing spaces, bars and so forth. Dynamic areas would be circulating cor-  
ridors, entry points and the like. This produces a map/overlay of the event  
during ingress, circulation \(mid-event\) and egress for normal and emer-  
gency situations, with the circulation areas shown as two people per square  
metre and the static areas as four or five people per square metre. This can  
help inform the management, the CCTV operators and the stewards of  
what to expect; it also acts as an early warning when we see higher than  
expected density in unanticipated locations.  
By mapping different routes and areas \(green, orange and red\), we iden-  
tify risk \(low, medium and high\) for the crowd dynamic. For example, sec-  
tions where a red route \(high flow rate\) meets a red area \(high density\)  
can be identified as potentially high risk. Again, the area mapping process  
should include both normal and emergency conditions during ingress, cir-  
culation and egress.  
The use of baking sheet allows us to put an ingress routing map over an  
ingress area/risk map and assess how the crowd may flow into that area, at  
that time, under normal or emergency situations. We can overlay normal  
and emergency maps; area maps and risk maps to provide a comprehensive  
visual analysis of crowd movements, over time, into key areas. This is a  
qualitative risk analysis that is simple to implement, and it provides valu-  
able insights. The process of drawing the maps also provides a much clearer  
understanding of the event dynamics. Do this for each relevant time period.  
\*  
A photocopied map can be rescaled, and driving type road maps will show routes to be  
much wider than they are in reality. Crowd and event modelling 129  
Say each hour, and you will build up a much clearer idea about how risks  
during ingress, circulation and egress can develop.  
You can also apply the mapping/layering process at any scale \(small sec-  
tions or whole sites\); you will learn more about your event by mapping the  
crowd movements by assigning capacity to each area, and by mapping risk  
using baking sheets, than you will by trying to describe a risk in words.  
Not all the space is used  
At this stage in the process, you will notice that the entire site is seldom  
fully utilised. There may be pockets of ‘unused’ space. This is an important  
point in site design; you should consider only the static and dynamic spaces  
for site capacity. Again, the mapping process, if done by hand, provides  
a valuable insight about use and utilisation of an event space. You will  
see where crowds move, where they do not move, where congestion and  
queuing can occur, and where the moving \(dynamic\) areas may overlap the  
queuing \(static\) areas and lead to congestion.  
We do not have time for this!  
A criticism of this approach to risk analysis was made during a webinar\:  
‘We are all too busy to do this kind of analysis’. We found that the map-  
ping process is actually quicker to perform than a conventional risk assess-  
ment; it is qualitative—it tells us about the quality of the space and provides  
insights into the dynamic nature of risk. We always stress that the conven-  
tional risk assessment is an essential element of event planning that should  
not be neglected, but the diagrams/mapping provide more information in a  
much more accessible format.  
When we hear the comment ‘we don’t have time for this’, we remind the  
delegate of the consequences, if an accident or incident occurs, of using that  
statement as a defence in court. ‘We didn’t have time to do this’ would be  
viewed as both negligent and incompetent.  
‘Isn’t this easier on a computer?’  
More than one delegate have suggested that the mapping and layering pro-  
cess would be much easier on a computer. In answer to this, we point out  
that by drawing, you have a ‘feel’ for time, direction, duration, severity and  
areas. You have the ability to reorder the layers; by placing an emergency  
layer over an ingress routing map, you can see things that might not be pos-  
sible to see on a computer screen. You also have a much larger area to work  
with on paper than on a computer screen, and you are using many more of  
your senses in the process. 130 Introduction to crowd science  
Distraction-free  
To use a computer, you have to learn which buttons to press; you have to  
learn operating systems, function keys, mouse-clicks, program inputs …  
you can be distracted by email, Twitter and Facebook feeds, anti-virus  
checks and spam, spam, spam! These are all distractions that you simply  
do not experience when you are drawing a line on a piece of paper. So we  
recommend that you switch the computer off, get out a sheet of baking  
paper and some coloured pencils, and draw a route overlay on a site plan.  
Use the diagrams to understand the dynamics of crowd risks; use them  
to illustrate problems and event issues for coworkers and clients. It is a  
very simple, quick and effective means of communicating the complexity of  
crowd risks in and around a major event—one that helps focus your mind  
on the dynamics of risk. This is best achieved using pen and paper.  
Use a computer system for tasks such as map investigation, where you  
can zoom into an area and print the relevant section for the mapping pro-  
cess. Area calculations on the computer screen are useful, with the right  
software. Area mapping software can be a more accurate analysis tool—  
provided they do not distract too much from the fundamental aim of crowd  
risk analysis. We tend to do a hand calculation on a map first and then check  
the results on a computer, or vice versa. This double checks our results and  
the process and can prevent errors from being overlooked.  
Tidy up  
Once you have completed a set of routes map, areas and rough sketches,  
they can, of course, be enhanced using computer graphics. We suggest this  
should only be performed after the analysis and not as part of the analysis,  
for the aforementioned reasons.  
MOVEMENT  
Once you have drawn the routing maps and area maps, you can assess the  
crowd flow rates. Flow rates will tell you how much time it might take an  
area to fill, and how long it might take the crowds to flow into, around and  
away from a site. For this you need to assess the narrowest point along a  
route line \(using the route maps\); that point will be the limiting factor for  
crowd flow. The width at that point, multiplied by 82 people per metre  
per minute, will be the best case for crowd flow \(the optimal\). So, draw  
a route line, find the narrowest point along the route, measure the width  
\(say 10 m\), multiply by 82 \(people per metre per minute\) and you have a  
value \(in this case 820 people per minute\). That is the value for the 100%  
capacity flow rate. Eighty-two people per metre per minute is the best case, Crowd and event modelling 131  
the optimal flow rate, under ideal conditions, on level ground and without  
backpacks, luggage, children, little old ladies, picnics, umbrellas, etc. We  
always recommend that you use this value with suitable consideration to  
the nature, demographic, condition and circumstances of your site. If you  
are unsure of your site flow rates, it is relatively simple process to measure  
this for your event.  
To evaluate risk, we need to assess whether the crowd can flow towards  
the narrowest point on that route more quickly than it can flow through  
that point. An example of potential risk would be an entry gate with ticket  
and/or search processes in place, or a series of routes leading to a single  
route. For those areas, the crowd may arrive in greater numbers than can  
pass through that part of the system, and congestion may occur.  
We need the routing diagrams and a few site measurements to assess the  
potential for excessive crowd build-up over time. The routing/mapping pro-  
cess could highlight some potential problems \(converging routes, crossing  
routes, counter flow on routes\), so you will need to either walk the site or  
check the plans again. If the routing/mapping process shows a risk, action  
may need to be taken. That is the purpose of this process\: to provide an  
insight into the dynamics of risk to crowds as they move in the built and  
complex environment.  
Movement graph  
Figure 5.5 shows the number of people passing through a system for entry,  
the arrival profile.  
This was obtained from a mechanical counting system at the stadium  
entry gates. Crowd loading to the event can also be estimated using the  
transport data \(how many people per train/bus/tram per minute/hour\) and  
presented in a graph of number of people arriving at the event over time.  
When you couple this type of information with route/area mapping, you  
can build a numerical \(quantitative\) analysis of the crowd flow and produce  
a risk analysis for the potential of overcrowding.

Route/area maps should indicate the potential risks, for example, the  
risk of congestion and crushing/injury. The numerical data quantifies the  
potential scale of the risk. If you identify a risk, you then need to implement  
some changes or control mechanism; the numerical analysis is only useful  
after the initial site review and risk analysis. We will demonstrate how this  
process is applied in Chapter 6 in a range of case study applications.  
PROFILE  
A crowd profile is a description of a crowd’s historical behaviour—the intelli-  
gence we may have on past incidents, and/or any information relating to their  
arrival profile. For example, some performers’ fans are known to arrive very  
early for events and camp out on the streets. The Royal Wedding \(the UK,  
2011\) saw people arrive and take position around Queen Victoria memorial  
5 days before the event. Football supporters may display behaviour specific to  
fixtures or venues, and may require segregation strategies. We may also need  
to consider the male/female ratio in order to provide adequate toilet facili-  
ties. Examples of useful sources of information are the fan-based websites  
and discussion forums, media reports and reviews of previous events. The  
performers \(or agents\) may also provide information that could be relevant to  
management style; asking staff at other venues whether there are any specific  
issues to be aware of for fans of a specific performer may also be enlighten-  
ing. This information all helps define the management style for the event.  
Space, time, direction, flow  
As outlined earlier in this chapter, RAMP analysis is a qualitative pro-  
cess that we typically perform while assessing and designing sites for major  
events. Once the RAMP analysis is complete, the numerical data for spaces,  
times, directions and flow rates quantify the potential crowd risks. One  
common mistake we have observed is for delegates to jump straight into  
the numerical/quantitative analysis and start ‘bashing numbers’ into spread  
sheets before they have a clear understanding of the site dynamics. We  
have also seen a number of major projects pass a purely numerical analysis,  
performed in spreadsheets and using computer simulations, and fail during  
operations. To outline why this is a problem in both the rationale and the  
application of modelling/simulation, we need to review the uses and appli-  
cations of numerical/quantitative analysis.  
A downward spiral  
These concepts were originally outlined in the PhD thesis as the founda-  
tion for our study of crowd dynamics and the development of sophisticated Crowd and event modelling 133  
crowd simulations. As we have previously noted, there has been prolifera-  
tion of simulations on the market over the last decade; the cost of these  
systems will inevitably be driven by market demand, and consequentially  
users will become less and less skilled. Simulations are very attractive for  
a number of reasons; for example, their graphics/image quality has been  
increasing year by year, and their cost has been decreasing. As systems  
become cheaper, they become more widespread. The more widespread  
these systems are, the more people can use them with little or nor training.  
Be aware  
Safety-critical simulations need to be treated with caution and used by  
experienced, qualified practitioners—especially in the domain of crowd  
safety. Crowd simulations must be fully calibrated and independently vali-  
dated before being deployed in the field. We need to expand on this point  
further to highlight specific hidden risks.  
Simulations and risk analysis  
Crowd simulations, although useful, do not address many of the key risks  
associated with planning and managing events \(both large and small\). One  
of the motivations for moving away from simulations was that we could  
not validate the extremes of the crowd dynamic—the points of failure—in  
the same rigorous manner that other engineering disciplines require. To test  
steel, for example, you subject it to a series of destructive tests in order to  
establish how it performs; you cannot test a crowd to destruction to vali-  
date a computer system.  
We could simulate a crowd crush and crowd collapse to gain insight into  
the underlying mechanism of these phenomena, but it would not be a cali-  
brated or validated model. It would be an approximation at best, an edu-  
cated guess and nothing more. It may be an accurate guess, but it would be  
impossible to prove correct until we had the data—and we cannot get the  
data without subjecting the crowd to significant risk. We have measured  
lower crowd pressures at concerts and on the front-of-stage barriers, but to  
push a crowd to destruction is simply not possible!  
We could never fully validate the simulations. We could use them to  
assess risk, but this elicited no more out of the simulation than the input  
data. We had efficient, low costs techniques to help us understand certain  
types of crowd risks, sufficient to begin the process of defining a risk man-  
agement strategy. The computer simulation was not adding value to the  
overall risk analysis process.  
The lack of validation, coupled with the number of variables in  
crowd behaviour models, highlights the benefits of the meta-modelling  
approach and why this is needed in event planning, licensing/approval 134 Introduction to crowd science  
and in control rooms. The modelling approach, we would argue, is essen-  
tial to understanding and improving crowd safety. It does not attempt to  
prove a system safe; it only assists in the process of identifying the risks  
to the crowd.  
DIM-ICE\: Setting the standard  
The DIM-ICE meta-model is a template—a tool for collecting information  
with specific focus on crowd risks. There appear to be similarities in sys-  
tematic failures in other domains. Consider the sinking of the Titanic\: the  
design \(the ship, the number of lifeboats\), the information \(radar, observa-  
tions\) and the management process all contributed to the loss of life. These  
three categories \(design, information and management—DIM\) are not  
unique to crowd disasters; they are fundamental areas of failure common  
across a wide range of disciplines \(aviation, shipping, driving, crowds\). So  
focussing on these as a planning template in order to provide that valuable  
insight into how, when, where and why things can go wrong, made perfect  
sense in the development of a crowd and event model, particularly as we  
were focussing on accident and incident prevention, on risk analysis and  
safety engineering.  
Modelling events and crowds  
Unlike crowd simulations, the purpose of this type of modelling is not to  
predict how a crowd may move towards, occupy or depart a site. The meth-  
odology has one specific objective\: risk analysis. To this aim, the modelling  
tools test key elements of an event so that we can then define a strategy that  
fits that specific event/site/crowd. DIM-ICE is a blank template; the infor-  
mation that goes into the template defines the event.  
The use of a template allows the user to compare two similar events  
\(same performer, same type of people/crowd, different venue\) and two  
different events \(different performer, same venue, different crowds\) in a  
systematic and structured manner. That was the purpose of the model—  
its design was simply to capture information in a manner that retained  
those key elements, and to facilitate new users’ understanding of event  
risks.  
The DIM-ICE meta-model also has specific focus on operational, tactical  
and strategic development of site event plans, with specific focus on crowd  
management planning. It has a multitude of applications, and acts as a  
checklist for safety officers, police, licensing and site operators.  
When using the template the users capture knowledge and information  
that allows them to consider the phasing and implications of emergencies.  
For example, an emergency during ingress would provoke very different  
crowd management concerns than an emergency during egress. In most Crowd and event modelling 135  
plans, these two situations are simply not considered. For example, at Love  
Parade in 2010, where 21 lives were lost and over 541 people injured, there  
was an emergency during ingress. The event organiser failed to consider  
such an emergency; there were no contingency plans, no considerations  
for evacuation during ingress and no analysis of risk of combined crowd  
flows or crowd capacity/density at critical entry points or in areas with  
counter flow. The disaster would have been avoidable if the event planners  
had taken some time to build a simple event model. We will illustrate that  
process in Chapter 6—case studies.  
Objective of model building  
The aim of the model builder should be to construct a model that is easy  
to understand, that is easily able to evaluate information and detect errors,  
and which communicates the elements that may give rise to safety issues.  
To do this, one has to spend more time on the analysis of event and crowd  
safety requirements than on the process of building the model. All too  
often we have seen simulations being built in isolation, and key factors  
omitted in the simulation design process. These simulations are not fit for  
the purpose.  
Models are, by definition, representations of the system under study,  
and—especially when it comes to modelling crowds—there is a wide range  
of fundamentals that need to be defined and understood. It is not necessary  
to build a complex model of an environment in all of its possible configu-  
rations, with all of the individuals in all of their possible states. Indeed,  
such a model is analytically intractable and, more importantly, impossible  
to understand. There are simply too many unknowns; the model builder  
needs to break the process into logical, easy to build, easy to test, easy to  
understand sections. Often it is analysis of the problem that leads to a sim-  
pler model with clearer results. Fruin, in his thesis ‘Pedestrian planning and  
design’ \(p. 115\), stated\:  
The pedestrian planning process follows the classic sequence of prob-  
lem definition, identification of restraints, determination of program  
objectives, establishment of study scope and procedures, collection and  
analysis of data, development of alternative solutions. A planning pro-  
gram for pedestrians may involve one building, a small group of build-  
ings, a downtown core network, or even larger systems of interlocking  
networks. Project scope may range from a basic low budget improve-  
ment program, gradually implemented over a long time period, to a  
large capital project with accelerated priorities.  
The primary goals and objectives of an improvement program for  
pedestrians are\: safety, security, convenience, continuity, comfort, system  
coherence and attractiveness. All goals are interrelated and overlapping. 136 Introduction to crowd science  
In general, a good model would follow the aforementioned principles.  
It should be simple to build, modify and understand, and it should easily  
communicate its outputs to others.  
Why model crowds?  
With a model, you have a solid, worked-through, defendable position.  
Accidents can happen, but they should not be due to negligence or incomplete/  
incompetent risk assessment. Through the process of modelling, the user will  
develop a thorough and rigorous approach to the planning of crowded spaces.  
Modelling a crowd will save you from guessing and praying that every-  
thing will work out on the night of the event. It removes the uncertainty,  
saves time and money, streamlines event planning, produces a standardised  
approach to crowd management and ultimately provides you with an audit  
trail that, if done correctly, may provide a defence in court. Why did it go  
wrong? Were you adequately prepared? Can you prove it?  
During the model-building process for our consulting projects over the  
last two decades, we established the key elements of crowd risk analysis and  
safety engineering. We then questioned whether we needed to put this into  
a computer simulation at all? The DIM-ICE model we developed and used  
before building a simulation—the tools we used to structure and capture  
information of sites, events and operational processes/procedures—was  
perfectly suited to the purpose of crowd risk analysis.  
RAMP ANALYSIS\: SUMMARY  
The RAMP analysis provides the user with the geometric relationships for  
ICE under normal and emergency situations. It defines the routes, areas,  
flow rates, fill times, arrival profile and anticipated crowd behaviour.  
DIM-ICE\: SUMMARY  
The DIM-ICE meta-modelling approach is a systematic analysis of the  
behavioural influences on a crowd \(design, information and management\)  
with an emphasis on risk assessment during the different phases of an event.  
Modelling, monitoring and managing crowds is an integrated approach  
to crowd risk analysis and crowd safety. All three elements are required  
to a greater or lesser extent, and the meta-modelling approach, coupled  
with RAMP analysis, provides a framework for each of these elements. We  
define the meta-model for an event, which then indicates how to monitor  
the crowds, and from that the development of a robust crowd management  
strategy is developed. The result is a series of practical, operational and Meta model for potential crowd congestion

tactical/strategic objectives for specific sites/events. To evaluate the effec-  
tiveness of a strategy, we have one other tool that we can apply\: the matrix  
analysis technique helps us to visualise another layer of risk analysis.  
DECISION SUPPORT ANALYSIS  
The DIM-ICE meta-model is a matrix approach to capturing information  
and assisting in the event definitions; it helps the user make the right deci-  
sions on resource deployment. We use the same approach for other types of  
risk-related analysis. For example, Figure 5.6 shows crowd congestion for  
different weather conditions and site attractions. It evaluates different types  
of attraction at a specific event, under different weather conditions, for the  
risk of congestion. Using a matrix approach we can map one set of variables  
\(congestion, weather, attraction, etc.\) against another \(merchandise stands,  
bars, signing marquees, etc.\) and colour the table to indicate the potential  
congestion. In this example, we have used green \(shown as light grey in  
Figure 5.6\) to indicate less than 50% of that specific area’s capacity, orange  
\(shown as grey in Figure 5.6\) to indicate between 50% and 80% of that  
specific areas capacity and red \(shown as dark grey in Figure 5.6\) to indi-  
cate more than 80% of that specific area’s capacity. This identifies function  
against congestion and can be extended to other types of analysis.  
There are many uses and applications for matrix analysis and we have  
outlines of this application on www.GKStill.com with a variety of images,  
definitions and applications of this technique. You can populate the table  
with cost, risk, information and the like to assist you in assessing the best  
possible options. It is a low-cost option for decision support and we have  
found that delegates, with a little practise, will readily adopt the technique  
for event planning, site options and risk analysis.  
In the example \(Figure 5.6\), we can see that cold/bad weather will have a  
significant impact on congestion/risk at three key locations, as the crowds  
will be concentrated into sheltered areas.  
This modelling technique \(you can apply a similar approach to any event\)  
identifies the information element \(change in the weather will impact the  
crowd\) in relation to specific site functions and locations. In Chapter 6, we  
will focus on examples of the application of RAMP analysis, DIM-ICE  
meta-modelling and matrix analysis. We have many similar examples of  
how this matrix approach assists in the overall strategic planning of events  
on the educational support site and eLearning platform \(http\://www.  
GKStill.com/Education/\). Chapter 6  
# Case studies and examples  
My concern with risk management is that many \(not all\) risk profession-  
als are trying to redefine risk management to make it something broader  
than it actually is.

Safety is not an intellectual exercise to keep us in work. It is a matter of  
life and death. It is the sum of our contributions to safety management  
that determines whether the people we work with live or die.

INTRODUCTION  
We build crowd and event models to gain insights about any potential risks  
that may manifest during an event. During an event, the early indication of  
a developing risk, the warning signs that something is going wrong, is criti-  
cal to successful crowd management. Specifically, we build the DIM-ICE  
Meta model to evaluate any potential risk inherent in the design, informa-  
tion and management elements at different times during an event \(ingress,  
circulation and egress\). We use RAMP and matrix analysis tools to help  
us qualify and quantify the crowd risks at events. This is not an intellec-  
tual exercise; we need to assess risks in order to protect the public from  
harm. Unless you can identify and communicate the nature and potential  
of crowd-related event risks, they remain problems ‘lying in wait’.  
We developed these specific, visual risk analysis methodologies because  
the existing, brief description, single-number approach to risk analysis is  
flawed. Consider the process; the user has to first visualise a risk, then will  
try to describe the risk in a few words and then needs to assign a single  
number for likelihood and another number for consequence, both of which  
are highly subjective. In effect, the user is turning complex information into

a code; a few words and a number, the sum of the likelihood and conse-  
quence. Does this ­ process adequately describe all risks? Specifically, risks  
that may be dynamic, may change in both severity and duration.  
Let us evaluate the risk assessment process with specific reference to  
crowd safety at events. A risk assessment is compiled and documented.  
This is, in effect, turning a potentially complex description into a short-  
hand version of the risk. Consider the moment when someone else, reading  
the risk assessment, tries to translate this shorthand back into information,  
in order to manage the risk. The reader needs to reimagine, or visualise,  
the actual risk using the description in the risk assessment. This process is  
necessary to understand the risk, and then the reader needs to consider how  
to manage, mitigate or eliminate that specific risk. To put this into context,  
below is an example from a typical risk assessment.  
The risk is given a numerical value, defined as the ‘likelihood’ of the risk  
occurring times the ‘severity’ or consequences of the risk occurring. The  
descriptions are listed in Table 6.1.  
The value, the sum of the likelihood times the severity, is then assigned  
an action plan. Typically, this would read as shown below.

ASSESSING THE RISK ASSESSMENT  
The risk in Table 6.2 relates to trips, slips or falls; this does not describe if  
the risk applies to a specific location, or if this risk has a duration. There  
will be areas on the event site where the severity \(or consequences\) of a  
trip, a slip or a fall will have a much higher significance, and a greater  
impact on the crowd, where the time, the severity/consequences will be  
dependent on the nature of the crowd flow. For example, an entry system  
may have a much higher risk related to trips, slips and falls, for a short Case studies and examples 141

duration, during ingress. This is an example of a risk that is transient; it  
will have a higher severity \(several people could be injured\) under spe-  
cific conditions. To know where, when, and how long a risk will last is  
essential to good crowd management; yet, the process, the recommended  
methodology, does not record this information.  
In the example from Table 6.1, there are no specific areas mentioned,  
no duration and no indication that the risk may be higher under specific  
conditions. A value of 4 \(may occur from time to time\) and 2 \(minor  
injury requiring first aid\) are assigned. The action point is ‘pre-event  
check to remove loose material and level uneven ground. All cables bur-  
ied or at high level. Information about uneven ground and correct foot-  
wear’, appears to be the task of Bill Smith. Is he the person wearing the  
correct footwear? Perhaps, he is the designated person responsible for  
checking the public’s footwear. It may be his job to eject anyone not  
wearing the correct footwear! One would assume there is some definition  
of ‘correct footwear’ elsewhere and that the public know that ‘correct  
footwear’ rules apply at this event. The risk assessment does not define  
‘correct’ or to whom the ‘correct footwear’ rules apply. We also note  
that there are references to ‘Information about uneven ground’ specified  
in the risk assessment. Is that a sign or a diagram on a map? Perhaps, a  
designated person \(Bill Smith, wearing ‘correct footwear’\) will be telling  
people about uneven ground. We can see how inefficient this table is for  
both describing the risk and assignment of a risk factor.  
We note that if all these measures are enforced, then it will result in  
a reduced risk modified to 2 \(may occur but rarely\) and 2 \(minor injury  
requiring first aid\). Well, that is OK then, the risk is reduced to a value  
of 4 \(2  
×  
2\) which clearly puts the risk into the ‘low-risk, risks-controlled’  
category. This assumes that Bill will continue to check the footwear and  
maintain the site as outlined in the risk assessment, for the duration of the  
event. This is just one entry on the risk assessment, but you can understand  
the problems of decoding this information into a relevant and appropriate 142 Introduction to crowd science  
action plan. Without appropriate, understandable documentation in place,  
and an action plan, implemented correctly, you may be liable if the risks/  
hazards result in an incident.  
The current risk assessment process is cumbersome and onerous. It  
requires reams of paperwork, often, with little time to evaluate the nature  
and extent of many crowd risks. This leads to another fundamental issue  
of the conventional risk analysis process as many risk assessments are  
‘cut and paste’ from the previous events with little or no consideration  
for the evaluation of specific site- or event-based risks. Instead, crowd  
managers generally rely on experience, and this highlights a significant  
and widespread flaw in the process. Some experience cannot be gained  
until something goes wrong and, as we highlighted in the previous chap-  
ters, the near misses are seldom documented so that others do not gain  
the benefit of this experience.  
To illustrate this point, we were involved in a personal injury case \(as  
an expert witness\) where there were conditions that represented a specific  
risk to a specific demographic were not being noted. In this case, escala-  
tors were used as stairs at a main station in London. There were instances  
of old women tripping on this structure, and several instances over sev-  
eral months. This indicated that the system presented a specific risk to a  
specific demographic and during the busiest periods. This should have  
triggered an increase in the risk factor \(likelihood is high for a specific  
demographic, the little old ladies\) and introduction of specific safety con-  
ditions. The accidents resulted in significant injuries, and when the data  
were reviewed, it was clear that the process of updating the risk analysis  
was simply not being implemented. Part of the problem was this type of  
risk needs a level of understanding for the operators. Part of the problem  
is the operational team needs to be aware of the conditions under which  
specific risks can be much higher than normal. Risk can be dynamic—yet  
the risk analysis process is one description and one number. This fails to  
capture many of the risks to crowds in the built and complex environment.  
When we review the risk assessment process using a branch of mathematics  
called ‘information theory’, we can outline a fundamental failure of the sys-  
tem. We stress that the aim is not to make the process broader than it already  
is, but rather to highlight how simpler, illustrative analysis can enhance the  
risk analysis process, can make it simpler to describe, understand and use.  
Information theory  
In 1948, Claude Shannon published a paper called ‘A Mathematical Theory  
of Communication’ which defined the concept of information theory. A key  
measure of information theory relates to the number of bits of information  
necessary to successfully transmit information so that it does not suffer  
undue loss of information. Case studies and examples 143  
From Wikipedia\:  
The main concepts of information theory can be grasped by considering  
the most widespread means of human communication\: language. Two  
important aspects of a concise language are as follows\: First, the most  
common words \(e.g. ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘I’\) should be shorter than less common  
words \(e.g. ‘roundabout’, ‘generation’, ‘mediocre’,\) so that sentences  
will not be too long. Such a trade off in word length is analogous to  
data compression and is the essential aspect of source coding. Second,  
if part of a sentence is missing the recipient should still be able to glean  
the meaning of the underlying message.  
Information theory and risk assessment  
When we construct a risk assessment, we are converting complex infor-  
mation into a condensed form and recording this in a document. At some  
point in the future, this information needs to expand back into a set of  
operating instructions. To be effective, there should be no loss in data, and  
the condensed form should contain all the necessary information to allow a  
clear and comprehensive reconstruction of the original information. When  
information is converted into a smaller, more condensed form, some infor-  
mation is lost. Furthermore, when the condensed form is expanded back  
into some form of understanding \(the original form\), any lost data can  
result in misinterpretation, errors and incomplete understanding. Again,  
the process depends on the experience of the individual in both creating the  
risk assessment and in processing the data from an existing risk assessment  
that another individual may have compiled.  
Throughout all of the above, there are a variety of event, company and  
other guidelines for individuals who participate in the risk analysis process,  
but the events industry is a low-cost, low-margin business and the required  
skills set is not always present in the operators. As we have highlighted  
in the previous chapters \(and case study examples in this chapter\), many  
risks are not identified correctly and remain problems ‘lying in wait’. There  
needs to be a more comprehensive approach to developing a crowd risk  
assessment, defined qualifications and standards for checking a crowd risk  
assessment and there needs to be more awareness in the control room to  
these types of problems.  
HSE guidance for event organisers  
Although this book was written in the context of the UK guidance and leg-  
islation, the international reader is advised to review the local legislation and  
guidance for their own events. In our experience, the guidance and legisla-  
tion are highly variable from country to country, state to state and yet, the 144 Introduction to crowd science  
risks to the public are the same worldwide. Sadly, the information about  
crowd risks and causality has been poorly documented and rarely distributed  
to a wider audience, in a form that can be easily understood or applied. As  
the opening quotation stated, ‘many \(not all\) risk professionals are trying to  
redefine risk management to make it something broader than it actually is’.  
The UK HSE has useful information and we cite this specific section  
from http\://www.hse.gov.uk/event-safety/event-organisers.htm  
Event organisers  
You will have prime responsibility for the health and safety of your\:  
•  
•  
•  
Workers  
Members of the public \(your audience/the crowd\)  
Contractors working for you at the event  
Ask yourself\:  
•  
•  
Do I have enough knowledge about health and safety to organise  
work appropriately?  
Have I thought through and implemented good health and safety  
procedures and checks?  
It is an honest series of statements and questions but defines no real stan-  
dards for the process beyond the coded risk assessment \(visualise the risk,  
code this into a short sentence, assign a number, hope that someone reads  
and understands the code and then acts in a way as to prevent the risk becom-  
ing an incident\). All this assumes that the information is both complete and  
transmitted without distortion. It also assumes that there are levels of compe-  
tency throughout the process, namely, a competent person is coding the risk  
and an equally competent person is reading and acting upon the risk assess-  
ment. On the question of competency,\* the HSE \(UK\) defines the following\:  
Get competent advice  
As an employer, you must appoint someone competent to help you meet  
your health and safety duties. A competent person is someone with the  
necessary skills, knowledge and experience to manage health and safety.  
You could appoint \(one or a combination of\)\:  
•  
•  
•  
Yourself  
One or more of your workers  
Someone from outside your business  
\*  
http\://www.hse.gov.uk/business/competent-advice.htm Case studies and examples 145  
You probably manage most aspects of your business yourself, or with  
help from your staff. But if you are not confident of your ability to  
manage all health and safety in-house, you may need some external  
help or advice. There are a number of different sources of advice.  
These include\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Trade associations  
Safety groups  
Trade unions  
Consultants registered on the Occupational Safety and Health  
Consultants Register \(OSHCR\)  
Local councils  
Health and safety training providers  
Health and safety equipment suppliers  
Deciding what help you need is very important. Unless you are clear  
about what you want, you probably won’t get the help you need.  
Things to consider when using external help  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Make sure you clearly explain what you need and check that they  
understand you. Ask them to explain what they understand the  
work to be and what they will do, when they will do it and what  
they will charge you.  
Check for evidence of relevant training/knowledge, such as for-  
mal qualifications or practical experience of providing advice  
in your industry/area of work. Can they explain why they are  
competent to advise you on your particular problem? Are they a  
member of OSHCR?  
Shop around to find the right help at the right price. If you were  
buying equipment or another service for your business, you  
wouldn’t always accept the first offer; so, do the same with health  
and safety advice.  
Check that the person you choose is adequately insured.  
Consider whether you have received the help you needed. Do you  
have a practical, sensible solution to your problem? Or have you  
ended up with something completely ‘over the top’ or a moun-  
tain of useless paperwork? If you are not happy with the solu-  
tion, ask for an explanation and whether there may be a simpler  
alternative.  
The inspiration behind the quote above ‘… there may be a simpler alter-  
native’ resonates with Rasmussen’s quote ‘… redefine risk … to make it 146 Introduction to crowd science  
something broader than it actually is’. The statement that suggests, ‘shop-  
ping around’ needs careful consideration\:  
•  
Shop around to find the right help at the right price. If you were  
buying equipment or another service for your business, you  
wouldn’t always accept the first offer; so, do the same with health  
and safety advice.  
The service, and hence the standards, will obviously have some price  
variations and will inevitably drive the buyer to their perception of ‘best  
value for money’ in other words the ‘cheapest’ service. We highlight three  
problems with the existing process\:  
1\. The existing recommendations on risk assessment fail to identify  
the location, duration and severity of the risks, specifically as many  
crowd-related risks are time dependent.  
2\. The recommended process would fail the test criteria for information  
capture and transmission \(information theory\) and hence, it is a fun-  
damentally flawed process and needs review.  
3\. There are no standards throughout the industry relating to the  
description and classification of risk, specifically, the location, dura-  
tion and severity of risks.  
Until the process is improved, we would argue that failing to recognised,  
record and subsequently failing to manage the risk is failing an essential duty  
of care to the public, to protect them from harm for places of public assembly.  
Accident causality  
In Chapter 3, we outlined the principle of proximate and distal causality and  
how unsuitable event and crowd management plans, safety concepts and  
site design are one of the fundamental failings, that can then lead to acci-  
dent and incidents. To clarify this statement, negligent planning and lack of  
appropriate checks during the approval process can lead to over confidence  
in a plan, and event or a site, that fundamentally flawed, has a high risk of  
failing, has a problem \(or problems\) lying in wait.  
Failure to identify risks, either during the planning or during the approval  
process can lead to prosecution. If a poorly constructed event plan does pro-  
ceed to the operational phase, the ability to assess risk in the environment,  
whether it is realising that the entry system is not operating as expected, or  
the site is becoming too congested in specific areas, falls to the operations  
team, the crowd manager and the control room functions.  
It is essential that event planners and specifically anyone involved in  
approving an event realise their duty of care to protect the public from harm Case studies and examples 147  
and the primary mechanism for this is the crowd risk assessment process.  
The history of major incidents indicates that there is room for significant  
improvement in both understanding and managing the crowd dynamic in  
places of public assembly. Furthermore, there are legal, ethical and moral  
responsibilities to be adequately trained and competent to perform the risk  
analysis for the event planning and the event approval process.  
Accidents can be a result of poor planning, failure to identify a poor plan  
in the approval process or failure to implement the event to plan. During  
an accident, investigation of the proximate and distal causes can be con-  
fused, specifically if the investigators and legal teams are not familiar with  
these concepts in the context of human behaviour, events and crowd risks  
in places of public assembly. We are not aiming to replace any legal defini-  
tions of causality, only to highlight that a competent person should be able  
to assess risk during the planning and approval stages of the event process.  
It is equally important that the recommended process is fit for its intended  
purpose, in that it is neither onerous \(nor open to short cuts like ‘cut and  
paste’\) and adequately records the information relevant to the risks involved,  
in particular, the dynamics of risk.  
Adequate training  
One key question asked of witnesses, following incidents, is ‘were you  
adequately trained to perform your duties’? Obviously, this includes the  
process of risk assessment. Unfortunately, this is a poorly regulated pro-  
cess and there are no rigorous standards for the quality of a risk assess-  
ment, either in format or in content. Risk analysis is a subjective process  
and requires a wide range of experience that can be difficult to build up  
without formal training. It is not enough for an organisation to assign  
someone the duties of a safety officer, as the organisation itself can be  
accountable if it assigns an untrained safety officer. Since it is up to the  
individuals concerned to identify, document and manage risk, we would  
argue that there needs to be an introduction for standards of competence  
across the industry.  
Competency  
For crowd safety, a competent person must have a set of skills that include  
the ability to identify, understand and articulate crowd risks. Specifically,  
location, duration and severity of risks that are transient in nature. To  
assist in this classification of risks, we will outline examples of event plan-  
ning and risk analysis from case studies around the world. We hope that  
these examples will illustrate some of the key points associated with using  
the modelling approach and the systematic analysis of crowd risks. Our  
aim is to show, by an example, a cross section of risk with the objective of 148 Introduction to crowd science  
highlighting how to identify similar types of risks at different events. We  
do this using the models described in the previous chapters and illustrate  
these with case studies.  
CASE STUDY EXAMPLES  
In this chapter, we will apply the three modelling techniques, RAMP anal-  
ysis and DIM-ICE meta-modelling, to a range of events from the previ-  
ous workshops or consultancy projects from around the world to illustrate  
how these techniques are applied, how risks can be identified and resolved.  
These include analysis of the following events\:

The model solution  
We designed the modelling process to capture information using the sim-  
plest of skills and in the minimum time. Over the years, we noted that  
accident and incident reports are often written in days \(if not weeks\) after  
an incident and are both a time-consuming and onerous task. To put this  
into perspective, try this exercise\:  
1\. Describe your movements yesterday in words.  
2\. Now, describe your movements this time last week in words.  
One of the two things may happen now; you may skip over this task  
thinking it is too much of an effort, or you may not be able to articulate  
your actions in words. In either case, the information will be lost. Now,  
take a map of the area and visualise the places you went yesterday or last  
week. Print off a map and draw a line indicating the places you visited.  
Where you may have struggled to describe your movement yesterday, or  
last week in words, you will find it was quick and simple to draw your  
movement on a map. Furthermore, anyone looking at that map will be  
able to understand where you were. The picture takes a few seconds, the  
words may take several hours, both of them capture the information for  
later review, but the diagram is much easier to produce and understand.  
This is the essence of capturing the crowd movements and identifying  
the potential for risk using a mapping process. It takes a few seconds and  
captures the important information for others to review later.  
The RAMP analysis is an extension of this data-capturing process.  
Obviously, you need a few basic skills to complete an RAMP model, not  
the least of which is to know your way around a site plan, map or diagram.  
You also need some basic arithmetic skills. Some people may be good at  
report writing, some may be good at numbers and some may be good at  
reading maps, plans or diagrams. We are all different and skills vary. We  
suggest that report writing may be more challenging than sketching lines  
on a diagram. To be frank, if this book is too difficult, if these examples are  
too difficult, then you should consider another career path.  
Crowd risk analysis and crowd safety are fundamentals for event plan-  
ning and event approval \(licensing or permitting\). Over the last decade,  
we have found that the basic skills are missing, yet they are not difficult to  
learn and apply. From stewards to senior police officers, we have passed on  
these techniques, they are used, practised, enhanced and passed on through  
the industry. We have seen improvements to many major events over the  
last decade. Key competency and the core skills required to achieve a more  
informative crowd risk analysis are the subject material for the workshop  
we run around the world. This book, and the associated eLearning site  
will, hopefully, spread the word further. 150 Introduction to crowd science  
MODELLING AN EVENT  
Modelling an event is fundamental to understanding risks and keeping  
crowds safe. You should develop models based on your experience and  
things you remember about a site or similar events. During the process, you  
capture that knowledge, and process the information that may be other-  
wise difficult or onerous to document in a report. Crowd and event models  
also assist other people to both visualise the situation and to communicate  
any potential for harm that may exist. The process converts your knowl-  
edge into a form that helps communicate risk to other people, for example,  
police, emergency services, licensing officers, crowd managers and stewards.  
Drawing a site diagram, and adding layers of information, such as crowd  
flow routes and risk mapping, makes you think about how the situation  
can change through time. You can turn something complex into something  
simple and understandable. In addition to this, the process of drawing pro-  
vides a valuable tactile and visual dimension to the information, one that  
you simply do not experience when using \(say\) a computer graphics package.  
A PICTURE SPEAKS A THOUSAND WORDS  
There is no need for a site plan or risk assessment to contain thousands of  
words when a sketch can say more. A simple drawing works like a snap-  
shot through time and there are many benefits to having this snapshot. As  
you are drawing the site, and refining the model, you are capturing your  
ideas and your concerns. You are also gathering and collating information  
during the process of modelling. You are systematically working through  
plans, spotting risks and understanding the context of your event, turning  
your experience into a form that will benefit others.  
Putting diagrams into your event plans and risk assessments makes  
them more understandable. You, and others who view these diagrams, can  
instantly recognise areas that need attention. A single diagram can convey  
the crowd risks during an event; it can place it in time, pinpoint the inten-  
sity and the movement of the crowd. Creating a model of your crowd and  
space will help you present your case to those who finance the event. This  
has proven, in many cases, to assist in justifying the necessary budget for  
safety expenditure. It will help you keep your event safe. There are many  
benefits to this low-cost, simple-to-implement, process.  
HOW TO BEGIN  
The best place to start is an event site map, diagram or plan. Buy some  
baking sheet \(the white/clear kind, do not use the brown thicker kind of Case studies and examples 151  
baking sheet\) and place a layer of baking sheet over a site map. You can  
buy this in 10 m rolls from a supermarket. You can buy the same material  
from an art store or office stationary supplier and it will cost you 10 times  
the price. Baking sheet and a box of coloured pencils are the basic materi-  
als you need and these are available from supermarkets for a few pounds  
\(or dollars\).  
We typically recommend that you sketch out a site diagram using three  
colours. Red for areas of risk, orange for areas that need to be monitored  
and green for areas that were at risk and are now safer. Obviously, you can  
omit green for the bulk of the mapping and only indicate orange and red.  
We typically begin with the ingress process and use different layers to rep-  
resent different times. A 10 a.m. layer, a 11 a.m. layer, 12 p.m. layer and so  
on. Sometimes, this can be days, hours or minutes, and the timescale is only  
important depending on the rate of change in the risk. So, if there is a change  
in a risk for an area, that should become a new layer.  
To illustrate this, imagine we have an event that the crowds will gather  
outside several hours before the event \(a pop concert perhaps\). We would  
suggest that the time the first person arrives is the beginning of the map-  
ping process, perhaps showing the area as blank \(no risk, you could colour  
the whole map green, but this adds no further information\). Then if crowds  
begin to accumulate, we would suggest that the area the crowd occupies is  
coloured orange indicating that this is an area that may need to be moni-  
tored. As time progresses and the event is about to open, the crowd may  
begin to push forward and we may want to indicate this as a red section.  
Obviously, if the barrier design, information, time \(start and end time\),  
management structure, and the like are all in place, then there will be  
little or no risk to the crowd during the process of entering the event. By  
drawing the maps, we have made an estimate of the area the crowd will  
occupy; this provides us with information about the number of barriers,  
stewards and potentially the style of management required. For example,  
if you anticipate a large crowd accumulating around the entry points, the  
diagram will help you define the potential number of stewards that may be  
required to manage the situation.  
We suggest that you use big thick lines to represent large crowd move-  
ments towards sections of the map. The red area represents potential areas  
of risk, and orange sections represent areas where we need to monitor risks.  
We also suggest that you create a new map for every hour of the event  
because each hour may tell a different story. As you continue to process this  
information and draw out the maps, you are visualising the event unfold-  
ing. As you then deliver an event, you can check and enhance the models  
for the next event in this area. This may sound time consuming, but it  
takes less time than documenting reports and providing written situation  
analysis. 152 Introduction to crowd science  
VISUALISING RISK  
At the start of this chapter, we outlined the problems associated with the  
conventional risk assessment process. The final product of this is a set of  
coded instructions that are difficult to understand.  
Of what use is a risk assessment if people fail to act on the nature of the  
risk? The process of thinking through a risk analysis and then converting that  
process into a few words \(there is seldom more than a half-formed sentence in  
many of the risk assessments we have viewed over the years\) is open to misin-  
terpretation at several stages. Initially, converting a risk assessment document  
into a few words, and then assigning a single value for the risk then stating an  
action plan \(often with fewer words\). The process is both archaic and is open to  
interpretation at several levels. It is highly subjective and requires the reader to  
understand far more than the words state. It fails to capture any risk dynamic,  
where the risks may be dependent on several influences \(such as overcrowding  
at an ingress or egress point due to a sudden change in the weather\).  
RAMP ANALYSIS  
You can work through event plans in a methodical, systematic and rigor-  
ous manner, mapping routes, areas and risk. If you apply this methodol-  
ogy \(RAMP and DIM-ICE\), you can capture specific event information,  
compare and contrast different events and develop a clearer understand-  
ing of the dynamics of risk prior to, during and postevent. If you use the  
same approach for all of your events, you will understand the differences  
and similarities of a wide range of events.\*  
You are able to look at a whole variety of elements that affect ingress  
such as the arrival profile, modes of transport, the media, the information,  
and the weather forecast. You are able to capture that information during  
the event-planning process. We stress that this does not replace risk assess-  
ment, it does not replace the event plan, but it enhances both the process  
and the identification of the crowd risks. The process provides the user  
with a meta-model for the crowd element within the context of the event,  
the building and the space used by the crowds. That is why we define this  
as a standard template. There are some events where some columns might  
have very little in them, but the overall model will still fit into the DIM-ICE  
template.. To put this into perspective, the next few sections are examples  
from our projects. These will illustrate how the modelling approach helps  
us define the key risks and resolve these during the planning phase of the  
event process.  
\*  
Running workshops around the world, we see many similarities and underlying risks across  
many different types of international events. Case studies and examples 153  
INGRESS—CAPACITY—BEIJING OLYMPICS  
TORCH RELAY  
The project was to review a crowd management plan for the Gerrard  
Street leg of the Beijing Olympic Torch Relay and we produced a 68-page,  
14,400-word, illustrated report using the DIM-ICE and RAMP analy-  
sis techniques. Although there were a number of potential issues, the  
primary concern was the ingress and approach routes. To highlight the  
power of using visuals, here is the description of the key area of concern  
from the report. These were the clients words, from the original brief.  
… The arrival profile and direction of approach is of concern. The  
area on Gerrard Street is limited and has the potential to become over  
crowded. The most appropriate approach will be along Shaftsbury  
Avenue, not the direct approach, from the tube stations. This will allow  
the viewing area to fill progressively and alleviate crowd pressures and  
potential frustrations.  
The reader has to visualise the site to understand the context of the text  
above. This can, of course, lead to a potential misunderstanding. Using a  
line diagram, we can explain the process much more clearly. Figure 6.1  
Figure 6.1  Route of the Beijing Torch Relay along Shaftsbury Avenue and cutting into  
Gerrard Street \(China Town\). The access to Gerrard Street is restricted and  
the main media bus could not make the turn. The runner would take the  
Gerrard Street leg and re-join the media bus back on Shaftsbury Avenue. 154 Introduction to crowd science  
shows the route that the Torch Relay will take; the Gerrard Street section is  
the China Town area in London.  
Shortest routes  
The crowd can move towards Gerrard Street from the two London  
Underground stations; Piccadilly Circus \(lower left\) and Leicester Square  
\(mid right\) \(Figure 6.2\).  
We can measure the area on Gerrard Street \(both sides\)—it is 1200 square  
metres. At two people per square metre, this will hold 2400 people. This is  
the routes and areas part of the RAMP analysis; the routes leading from the  
stations to the site and the area of the site. This site has a limited capacity  
and the crowd will be going to the event to view the Torch Relay \(obviously\).  
Comparing the two diagrams \(Torch route and route to the event space\),  
you can see that the approaching crowd may take the shortest path and only  
the first 2400 can be accommodated on the route. If more than 2400 people  
try to reach Gerrard street, they will find themselves in a position where  
1\. They cannot see the Torch Relay.  
2\. They may be in a hazardous situation, as we do not know how many  
people may come to the event.  
As this is a free event, and the London Underground capacity for trans-  
porting people to the site is vast, we could find 2000 or 20,000 people  
Figure 6.2  Shortest routes from the London Underground stations to the Gerrard  
Street \(ChinaTown\) area. Case studies and examples 155  
trying to access Gerrard Street. We do know that only 2400 will be able to  
enter the space. In this specific example, the arrival profile is unknown; so,  
we must plan for the worst case.  
Crowd objectives  
If the crowd comes to see the Torch Relay, we need to direct them along the  
torch relay route, filling Gerrard Street, and then if more people approach,  
they are filling along the Torch route. Figure 6.3 shows the safer approach  
route. The total viewing area \(along the Torch route from both London  
underground tube stations\) is 7760 square metres; so, we can accommodate  
15,520 people along this route, two people per square metre, from the bar-  
rier line, standing shoulder to shoulder which would be a comfortable view-  
ing configuration for a Torch Relay. We now need to manage this process.  
Counting \(clickers\) at a key location would provide an accurate method of  
assessing numbers, but a visual inspection of the area and stewards instructed  
to assist an even fill across the area, by simply talking and guiding people  
along the route, a more practical solution for a safe and even crowd density.  
The analysis \(routes, areas and movement\) gave us a reasonable analysis of  
how the crowd may move to the site. The problem \(shortest path\) was identi-  
fied and an alternative was established. The profile of the crowd now needs to  
be assessed. There was a significant public outcry on the China/Tibet human  
rights issues with newspapers reporting on the situation of violent protests.  
Figure 6.3  By diverting the crowd along Shaftsbury Avenue, when Gerrard Street is full,  
the crowd will backfill along Shaftsbury Avenue along the torch relay route. 156 Introduction to crowd science  
Crowd behaviour  
The crowd coming to this event may have protestors; this will dictate the  
style of management. The Chinese Ambassador was to carry the Torch  
along part of the route \(originally planned near the British Museum\). This  
area was in the media spotlight, it was both a wide, open area and may  
attract a much larger crowd. The Gerrard Street element \(as you can see  
from Figure 6.3\) was difficult to access, the media would not be present in  
this area. The media were going to be on busses following the Torch, the  
busses could not turn into Gerrard Street, but the Chinese Ambassador  
could take the Torch through China Town \(Gerrard Street\), which seemed  
an obvious solution to a number of problems.  
This should not be publicised in advance; this type of information can  
­ influence crowd behaviour, and may cause protesting crowds to go to  
Gerrard Street to display their disapproval. Gerrard Street is a small space  
and could prove difficult to manage if there were protestors in this section.  
That was the crowd management plan, using the RAMP analysis and this  
is how it played out in the media.  
From the BBC on 6 April 2008.  
Clashes along Olympic torch route  
Thirty-seven arrests have been made after clashes between pro-Tibet  
protesters and police as the Olympic torch made its way through  
London. Protests over China’s human rights record began soon after  
the relay began at Wembley, and prompted an increasing police ­ presence  
through the city. After an unpublicised change to the route, the Chinese  
ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown.  
Summary  
In this short example of a case study, we have demonstrated the use of  
the RAMP analysis. Design, information and management will influence  
the crowds’ behaviour; so, we need to understand the design limits \(the  
space and approach routes\), we need to understand how to inform the  
­ public of the route to Gerrard Street and how this information is released  
to the media \(or not in this case\). We also need to know how to direct the  
crowds to the site from the stations \(management\), what barrier configura-  
tion we need in order to divert the crowds away from the shortest route and  
along the Torch route. This also dictates the management style we need to  
employ on the day, specifically, as there may be a protest element within  
the planned event. If we examine the site, Figure 6.1\: This is the route the  
torch relay will take. Figure 6.2\: This is how the crowd will approach the  
site \(the shortest distance to the site\), but the site has limited capacity and  
may fill too quickly \(more people could try and go to this area than the area Case studies and examples 157  
can accommodate\). Those individuals that cannot see the torch relay will  
then be backing up from the site along the shortest path. This is potentially  
dangerous as the crowd will be moving forwards to an already full space  
and people will react to not being able to see the torch. We need to route the  
crowd as shown in Figure 6.3, so that the crowds approach along the torch  
route and everybody can see the torch relay.  
The RAMP analysis provides a strategic framework for the above crowd  
management decisions. It enhances the risk analysis and risk management.  
MANCHESTER UNITED VICTORY PARADE  
A victory parade will be held on Monday 30 May to celebrate  
Manchester United’s record-breaking 19th league title and, potentially,  
their fourth Champions League trophy win.  
Local press  
We were asked to evaluate route options and potential risks related to the  
Manchester United Victory Parade scheduled for 30 May, 2011. In 1999,  
hundreds of thousands of fans attended a similar event and there were sig-  
nificant safety concerns, not the least of which was the police taking on a  
public safety role during the event, due to crowd pressure and crowd crush-  
ing. All events of a similar nature, since 1999, had been cancelled. The  
quote\* below was typical for previous years of cancellation.  
Assistant chief constable XXX said last night\: GMP’s primary con-  
cern is the safety of the people of Greater Manchester and the fans  
of the club.  
It is right and fitting that Manchester United’s fans should have the  
chance to celebrate the club’s success this year in the event of a win on  
Wednesday, but they should do this in safety.  
The last major homecoming event was in 1999 where there were seri-  
ous safety issues raised regarding the risks of crowd crush. Manchester  
United is the biggest football club in the world and we believe any event  
would attract more people than in 1999.  
We reviewed the CCTV \(helicopter\) footage from the 1999 video and  
could understand the concerns. The crowd images showed shockwaves; the  
crowd density must have been six/seven people per square metre. The bus  
was moving through the crowd with a phalanx of police officers trying to  
move the crowd aside to allow the bus to progress. This was the cause for  
\*  
http\://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/united-parade-  
doomed-954325 158 Introduction to crowd science  
concern from the Greater Manchester Police due to the potential for crowd  
injury.  
The proposed route is shown in Figure 6.4.  
The first elements we checked for this project were the transportation  
hubs; in this case, the train stations and trams, the road and parking spaces.  
They evaluated the routes from these locations to the parade route/view-  
ing areas. As we can see in Figure 6.5, the stations are within a few blocks  
of the top of the parade route. These are main line stations, Manchester  
Victoria Station, Manchester Oxford Road and Manchester Piccadilly.  
A large section of the route is not accessible for road \(due to road closures  
which would be in place hours before the parade starts\) and is not close to  
a railway station.  
The station at Old Trafford would not be used for this event.  
We can see from Figure 6.6, that the East side of the parade route is  
accessible to three main railway stations. This immediately highlights a  
potential problem, as the route would be barriered, separating the vehicles  
and the public. The question of efficient filling of both sides of the route  
would need to be considered.  
There is also a large proportion \(\~50%\) with no close-by railway stations.  
It is reasonably foreseeable that the section to the top of Figure 6.6, on  
the Eastern approach, would have the highest density. The section with no  
immediate rail access may be sparsely populated, and the area around Old  
Trafford may experience the highest density \(there are direct motorway-to-  
Figure 6.4  Victory parade route for Manchester United Football Club. Case studies and examples 159

Figure 6.6  Large section of the route has no direct rail access; due to road closures,  
there will be few people along this section. 160 Introduction to crowd science  
stadium routes with no road closures in place along these routes and ample  
car parking at the stadium\).  
We can see from Figures 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6, the key elements of a crowd  
management plan are beginning to form, specifically, the areas where stew-  
arding may need to be deployed. The diagram shows the potential for high-  
density areas, specifically, the sections from the rail stations to the parade  
route, that may require specific attention. It takes a few minutes to draw  
these kinds of diagrams and you should see the immediate benefit. It helps  
visualise the crowd movement, highlight concentrated crowd flows \(and  
hence density and potential risk\) and helps to assess the potential conges-  
tion and pinch points.  
We then walked the route with the Police and highlighted several pinch  
points relating to street furniture, raised areas where crowds will gather,  
sections where the crowds should be marshalled, advised on pedestrian  
management and how best to distribute the crowds along the route, and we  
also advised on specific management strategies for distributing the crowds  
along the route. This part of the analysis is qualitative, descriptive and  
visual as the Figures 6.4 through 6.6 indicate. We then had to assess the  
numerical \(quantitative\) element of the site, specifically, the capacity \(num-  
ber of people\) along key sections of the route.  
Parade route  
The parade was going to pass through the centre of Manchester and finish  
at Old Trafford. The first part of the numerical analysis was to evaluate the  
space and estimate the crowd capacity. To do this, we used our mapping  
software, and there are several free tools available on the Internet that will  
allow you to view a site, to measure spaces and to evaluate capacity. Our  
system couples site measurements with three-dimensional \(3D\) crowds,  
graphics of people, where we can populate a site and fly around it in a  
virtual reality environment. This helps us produce control room visuals for  
density estimation.  
Each section of the route was estimated for area into account, taking all  
the available spaces, for example, the roads and between buildings. For a  
parade route analysis, we could consider the whole area of the route, as we  
knew the barriers would be placed on the road separating the parade from  
the crowds. This would reduce the total site capacity by one-third. We  
measured the available areas of the road and pavements, the spaces from  
buildings on one side of the road, across to the other side, estimating the  
total available viewing space. We evaluate the capacity of this space at two  
people per square metre, then again, at five people per square metre. This  
provides us with a lower and upper number for the total available space  
and hence the number of people who can attend the event. If we position  
barriers, we may split the road into three sections \(West, middle and East\) Case studies and examples 161

Figure 6.7  Total available area, reduced by 1/3rd to allow for vehicles. This will be a bar-  
rier along both sides of the route.  
and therefore use 1/3rd of the available space for the vehicles and 2/3rds of  
the available space for the crowd. Using any of the free mapping tools, you  
can measure the site, and length of the route. You do not need specialised  
modelling tools to perform this task.  
The numerical results are shown in Figure 6.7.  
This now provides us with a good estimation of the total number of  
people these sections of the route can sustain. From these values, we need to  
review the train capacity \(how many people per train can arrive per hour\)  
and develop a fill strategy to ensure no section has excessive crowding. By  
following a similar process of evaluating the available areas, the routes  
and the times, you can evaluate your own site capacity and hence develop  
your own crowd management plan. How much space do you have? What  
is your site capacity? Will this be of low/high density? Are there any pinch  
points? From which direction will crowds approach? What are the rates of  
crowd arrival from the transport system? How quickly will your spaces fill?  
Space, time, direction, flow—the RAMP helps shape your crowd manage-  
ment plan.  
HILLSBOROUGH \(1989\)  
Figure 6.8 shows a scaled sketch of the site plan at the time of the  
Hillsborough disaster.  
Leppings Lane is approximately\* 14 m wide. At 82 people per metre per  
minute, this could reach a theoretical maximum of 1148 people per minute.

Lane could accommodate 1148 people per minute, to process this num-  
ber of people would require 1148/12.5  
=  
91.84 \(92 turnstiles\) to ensure  
no queueing in an unmanaged situation. Obviously, there is a trade-off  
between this upper value \(92 turnstiles\) and the practical limits of the local  
geometry. Some control is required \(such as a crowd management plan to  
regulate the crowd flow, a filtering system. Such a process \(filtering\) was  
used successfully in previous years to regulate the crowd flowing towards  
the turnstiles.  
Given the approach is wider than the entry system, there has to be some  
controls in place. Once the crowd begins to accumulate, to queue, we can  
estimate the fill rates, the throughput rates and hence the risks of crushing.  
The contingency plan for safe crowd management, where control points  
\(filtering\) should be positioned and the means of monitoring crowd arrivals  
further along Leppings Lane reduces the potential for overcrowding. In any

system where the number of people approaching the turnstiles/entry system  
can exceed the throughput rate of the turnstiles/entry system \(the rate at  
which people progress through the turnstiles\), there will be a queue. If the  
approaching crowd flow rate \(people per metre per minute\) is very much  
greater than the turnstile capacity, a crush \(and shockwaves\) will quickly  
develop with serious risk to life and limb.  
If there are design limits, then information \(such as advising entry times,  
locations, queue management, etc.\) helps reduce the risks and management  
may be required to control or regulate the approaching crowd flow. Sadly,  
this type of thinking was not applied at that time. The principles were  
known to engineers, but not to a wider safety audience, such as the safety  
managers, local licensing officers and the Police.  
At that time \(the 1980s\), the Police were managing this area by a process  
of trial and error; there were no scientific methods of understanding the  
potential for harm at that time from a police perspective. Police forces are  
NOT trained for this function. The police role, their function and training,  
is focussed on public order and not on public safety. An overcrowded space  
can become a problem of public order when crowds react to the dangerous  
and threatening conditions. We run a number of courses, specifically for  
Police forces on this specific issue—the differences between public safety  
and public order.  
This type of crowd crush is fundamentally a design failure. This space  
can fill very quickly, which leads to the crowd reacting to the risks of  
crushing. This type of system requires a crowd management strategy to  
keep it safe. That is the core of the problem; you need to understand the  
design limitations in order to develop the most appropriate crowd manage-  
ment plan. You need to regulate the crowd flow into the areas of similar  
geometric relationships, where ingress exceeds throughput. In the previous  
years, a filtering exercise performed that specific function, regulating the  
crowd flow, but without a specific knowledge of the crowd dynamic in  
these spaces. It was, as stated, a process of ‘trial and error’ with no scien-  
tific, mathematical or geometric understanding of the flow rates, risks and  
potential for harm.  
Once the crowd density reaches the shockwave limits \(where people are  
in close-packing, physical contact\), it becomes very difficult to manage and  
the risk to the crowd rises significantly. You need to understand rates of fill  
to assess these problems and to improve the crowd management process.  
For these kind of environments, there should be a continuous process of  
reviewing the risk assessment from event to event and to revise the crowd  
management plan accordingly.  
There are many similar examples of this type of geometry around the  
world, where spaces in front of entry systems are hazardous. These are the  
types of problems we frequently hear about in the workshops, those that are  
reported as the ‘near misses’. 164 Introduction to crowd science  
INGRESS—CIRCULATION—LINCOLN  
CHRISTMAS MARKET  
Lincoln Christmas Market is one of the largest Christmas markets in  
Europe, attracting up to 250,000 visitors over the 4-day event. The mar-  
ket spreads around the historic centre of Lincoln, including the castle and  
cathedral. The number of visitors is so great that a circular one-way system  
for pedestrians around the streets of Lincoln is put into place, taking the  
crowds through the Castle.  
Over the years, the event has grown and crowd-thinning measures have  
to be implemented during the busiest times. In 2010, the Christmas mar-  
ket had to be cancelled due to bad weather. This was, of course, for public  
safety reasons and the decision not taken lightly. Considerable consulta-  
tion and discussion about the relevant public risks were factored into the  
decision. From the local press\:  
Lincoln’s Christmas market has been cancelled for the first time in 28 years  
due to severe weather conditions. Rob Bradley from City of Lincoln  
Council said the ‘sad decision’ had been taken on advice from emergency  
service teams. Lincolnshire has experienced heavy snowfalls all week and  
more snow is forecast for the weekend. The market attracts about 150,000  
visitors and contributes millions of pounds to the city’s economy.  
In the following year \(2011\), record crowds attended the event and there  
were concerns about overcrowding at the Castle entry area. The press  
reports stated\:  
Organisers of Lincoln’s Christmas Market say they are looking to improve  
pedestrian access after receiving comments that the market was too busy.  
The City of Lincoln Council said the German-style market had been  
attended by about 200,000 people. The authority said it had received  
some comments about the market being too overcrowded to enjoy.  
We ran a crowd science workshop before the 2012 event and reviewed the  
issues relating to overcrowding from the 2011 event. The safety advisory  
group, various stakeholders and crowd management company attended the  
workshop. Together, we mapped the food and beverage locations, the route  
through the castle, entry points, crowd-thinning measures \(where a diver-  
sion strategy was implemented to reduce crowd congestion\) and we mapped  
out the areas of concern. Through this process, we noted that there was a  
concentration of food and beverage areas \(this slows the crowd down and  
causes congestion in critical locations\) and that the crowd-thinning mea-  
sure had to be implemented every year. One key finding was the official  
‘start point’ of the market became an area where the crowds converged from Case studies and examples 165  
Figure 6.9  Redesign of the Lincoln Christmas market area, a longer route, distribution  
of food and beverage, market stalls and entertainments along the route and  
multiple entry points all help to reduce congestion. Multiple entry point \(this  
map is of a smaller scale to Figure 6.10\).  
several routes and progressed through the Castle. This was a bottleneck  
in the system. To reduce this kind of congestion, we defined several ‘start’  
points, extended the route and spread the market across a wider area \(the  
market footprint and extended route are shown in Figure 6.9\).  
By extending the route around the back of the cathedral, we are increas-  
ing the area for attractions and providing more space for future expansion.  
We also define several ‘start points’ when visitors entering the Christmas  
areas from the bus drop off at the point and station. Although there were  
comments about some areas not having as much atmosphere, previously, a  
function of higher-density crowds, the event was a success and with more  
space for concessions, traders and attractions, future expansion is planned.  
The event in 2012 was run without incident, but locals and stall holders  
complained about new layout, about the potential for lost profit, and the  
smaller footprint \(Figure 6.10\) was re-introduced in 2013. We highlighted  
that profit should never come before safety.  
EVENT—SITE CAPACITY—LEICESTER CARIBBEAN  
CARNIVAL  
The community-organised carnival has been held annually since 1985 on the  
first Saturday in August, with a parade around the city of Leicester \(usually 166 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 6.10  Lincoln Castle is the main focal point of the Lincoln Christmas market, the  
system is one way through the castle and there are multiple routes leading  
to the entry point of the castle \(Market Square\).  
taking place in the city centre and the suburb of Highfields\), culminating  
in an event on Victoria Park. The parade is usually preceded by a week  
of cultural events. It is the third-largest Caribbean carnival in the United  
Kingdom, after the Leeds and Notting Hill carnivals.  
The carnival is promoted as the premier multi-cultural event within the  
Midlands and, according to the BBC and local sources, attendance is esti-  
mated between 60,000 and 100,000 in the August celebrations of 2010.  
The venue was based around Victoria Park \(site shown in Figure 6.11\),  
which has in excess of 90,000 square metres of space.  
Over the last 25 years, this has been a high-profile event generating citywide  
revenue. In 2010, the prospect of moving the event into the town centre was  
proposed and supported by the city authorities, despite an ‘advise against’ by  
the emergency services. The issue was brought to us during a workshop and  
we reviewed the problems associated with the proposed relocation.  
Space mapping  
We first need to evaluate the space available \(city centre\). For this, we used  
our site-modelling and measurement tool to establish that there were some  
10,000 square metres available \(see Figure 6.12\).  
This is not the total available space as some of this space is required for  
the market stalls \(1600 square metres\) and the parade \(1400 square metres\),  
leaving only 7000 square metres for the crowd. Case studies and examples 167  
Figure 6.11  The site of the Leicester Caribbean carnival, Victoria Park, the space is in  
the order of 90,000 square metres with crowds in the order of 60,000–  
100,000 people.  
No comparison  
We now have a number of people \(60,000\) and an area \(7000 square  
metres\). Divide the area by the number of people and you reach a figure  
of just over eight people per square metre. Clearly, the space would not be  
sufficient to accommodate everyone at the same time. We can see that if the  
previous year’s capacity figures were indicative of the numbers that may  
attend in the proposed year, there was a risk of a crowd crush.  
The counterargument to this analysis was that the crowd is transient;  
they come and go throughout the event. This is typical of a lack of risk  
awareness; the authorities understood economic constraints \(it would be  
cheaper to move the event into the town centre, cheaper barriers, no site  
infrastructure, etc.\) but are not well versed in the associated crowd risks,  
namely, there are more people who may attended than the space can accom-  
modate safely. We have seen this type of risk blindness many times, where  
the fundamental principles of overcrowding do not register as a potential  
hazard. The questions that should be asked are\:  
What do we do if 60,000–100,000 people try to attend the event?  
In this situation, the above question should have resulted in discus-  
sions relating to the use of barriers, crowd counting and crowd control, 168 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 6.12  The proposed site, city centre, showing the event footprint. This area is in  
the order of some 10,000 square metres. Market stalls reduce the area to  
8400 square metres and the parade would reduce the area to some 7000  
square metres.  
emergency planning, ‘what if’ scenarios concerning an emergency during  
the event and required access \(such as a medical emergency or fire\), not  
questions the city authorities either consider or try to address. Making  
the event happen is someone else’s job! They made the decision to move  
the event, to save money, and it was up to the operational teams to make  
it work.  
This kind of blinkered optimism and cost saving, where the mayor of a  
city insists that the ‘event will be good for the local economy’, is a problem  
we encounter several times a year and in each case, there is a lack of risk  
awareness on the part of the higher authority. So, we devised a simple, one-  
page graphic that the politicians could understand.  
This is a very useful technique to show space issues. You take two plans  
of the same scale and place them side by side. Then shade in the areas you  
want to compare. On the left \(Figure 6.13\) is the Victoria Park site, low  
crime and disorder, successful event, low crowd density and low risk to  
the crowd, we coloured this green in the presentation. On the right \(to  
the same scale\) the city centre, which is an unknown space for the event, Figure 6.13  Although the numbers clearly indicate the problem, these do not connect with the politician’s perception. The graphic, shown side  
by side, highlights the difference in the spaces.  
Case studies and examples 169 170 Introduction to crowd science  
we coloured this red in the presentation. In the previous years, the parade  
passed through the city centre and not the entire event.  
The two maps show in Figure 6.13, featured in a one page presentation  
with the legend\*  
The crowd that occupies the site on the left will not fit into the space  
on the right!  
That is one of the most powerful uses of a simple model; the visuals did  
all the work. We did not need to calculate space, flow rates of the passage or  
simulate anything to provide an ‘advise against’ but we did need to commu-  
nicate at the level of a politician who had the assumption that, somehow, it  
can be made to work.  
CIRCULATION—CAPACITY—THE JAMARAT BRIDGE  
In 2001, we had a call asking if we would assist in evaluating the design  
of the New Jamarat Bridge in Saudi Arabia. During the first visits to the  
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we saw a crowd simulation of the design pro-  
posal and asked to comment on its strengths and weaknesses. This specific  
simulation was a network model based on a hexagonal lattice and, as such,  
the crowd flow and density relationships were rudimentary and had several  
fundamental modelling flaws. To evaluate the relationship between crowd  
flow and geometry, a network lattice model was over simplified, fundamen-  
tally flawed and not appropriate.  
There were many different structural designs proposed, specifically, the  
Jamarah \(the pillar that represents the devil\) which would be changed  
to a larger shape. One of our tasks was to evaluate which shape would  
have the optimal throughput for the rituals \(the Rajm or lapidation pro-  
cess\). This Jamarat Bridge was an area where many mass fatalities had  
occurred and the proposal was to replace the existing two-tier structure  
with a five-tier superstructure \(ground plus four levels\). For any project  
of this scale, the first consideration is always the key question relating to  
the fundamental model of the system. In Chapter 1, we described how  
we developed modelling and meta-modelling techniques to capture vital  
information from this specific project; we also developed a fundamental  
model of the holy site.  
Before any crowd-modelling project, it is vital to understand the key  
parameters of the environment, the crowd activities and if there are any  
physical constraints. For the Jamarat Bridge Project, we established the  
basic model of the site as shown in Figure 6.14.  
\*  
The actual legend was a bit more direct and used more colourful language. Case studies and examples 171

Figure 6.14  Fundamental model of the Jamarat Bridge showing the key areas. There  
are three pillars, and the areas 2, 3 and 4 are repeated accordingly \(but not  
shown on the fundamental model as the dimensions will be the same\). Using  
Arabic convention, the numbering system reads from the right to the left  
\(as is the direction of crowd movement\).  
In this model, we have five different areas on each tier of the bridge.  
Ingress, queueing/throwing, passing, prayer and egress \(Figure 6.15\). Each  
tier has a different geometry but has the same fundamental model.  
1\. Ingress route to each tier, these five tiers had different origins \(Mecca,  
Mina, etc.\) and the concept was to separate each origin and desti-  
nation set to avoid cross-flows and congestion. The concept was to  
streamline the system.  
2\. Queueing/stoning area, this is the stoning ritual area.  
3\. The area where the crowds move past the pillars.  
4\. The area where a short prayer \(Dua’a\) is performed, then the crowd  
will move to the next pillar.  
5\. The egress route from that tier of the structure.  
On each tier, the process is 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5 as there are three  
pillars on each tier. A simulation will need to consider all areas for each  
tier but the fundamental model is an analysis of the design constraints. For  
that, we need to consider on the limits to the system and, as such, we only  
need to consider the system as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

There are several sections in the model shown in Figure 6.14 that the  
crowds need to move through for the rituals. A and B are the ingress sec-  
tions, C is the area where the stoning of the devil ritual is performed, D is  
the pillar, E and F are passing/prayer spaces \(where people can move past  
the pillar\) and G is the egress route.  
System rules  
The design criteria are to create a model of the system to allow 125,000  
pilgrims per hour, per tier, to perform the ritual \(stoning the devil\). The  
speed of the individuals in this area, as measured during previous Haj, is  
75 people per metre per minute. The first question is how big does A + B  
\(ingress\) need to be to facilitate this?  
125,000 people per hour divided by 60  
=  
= 2084 \(round up to the nearest whole person\).  
people per minute  
Seventy-five people per metre per minute means we have to divide the  
above number by 75 to obtain the minimum width  
=  
28 m \(again rounding  
up to the nearest whole number\). So, our first rule is that each tier entrance  
needs to be more than 28 m to accommodate 125,000 people per hour  
\(the design has two entry ramps, each ramp is 20 m wide\). We write this as  
\(using mathematical nomenclature\)\*  
1\. A + B ≥ 28 m available width at 75 Hajjis per metre per minute\:  
Which implies that E + F \> A + B \(for Dua’a/prayer and passing  
space\). We need enough space around the Jamarah \(the bridge is  
called Jamarat, the pillars are called Jamarah\). We simulated this  
and found that we have three times the ingress width as the ston-  
ing area, but the system would maintain equilibrium \(i.e. the ingress  
flow rate would balance the stoning ritual\). Therefore, the length \(D\)  
around the Jamarah must be three times more than the combined  
ingress width.  
2\. D ≥ 3\*\(A + B\)\: The area we needed for the rituals has to be sufficient  
so that not more than four people per square metre are packed in the  
space.  
3\. Area at C ≤ 4 people per square metre\: For the passing/prayer spaces,  
we must have more than the ingress space \(since the crowds must be  
able to pass the pillar while others are performing the ritual at the  
pillar\).  
\*  
≥ means greater than or equal to, ≤ means less than or equal to. Case studies and examples 173  
4\. E + F \> A + B \(for passing and Dua’a/prayer\)\: Finally, the egress route  
must be greater or equal to the ingress route to ensure that people can  
leave the system at a higher or the same rate if they are entering the  
system.  
5\. G ≥ A + B \(egress ≥ ingress width\)  
This is a fundamental model of a complex system. It only considers  
the ratio of the ingress, circulation and egress rates, the space and ritual  
requirements, to facilitate the desired throughput of 125,000 people per  
tier per hour. Providing the design adheres to the above rules the system  
should function. Reality means that we need to impose flow control,  
additional space, contingency for an incident and many other factors.  
The above rules are the minimum widths required for the system.  
We now have a design criterion for 125,000 people per hour, which is  
1\. Sufficient arrival capacity \(more than 28 m per tier\)  
2\. Sufficient throwing area \(the perimeter of the Jamarah must be  
three times the arrival width  
=  
28 m  
×  
3  
=  
84 m\)  
3\. Sufficient space \(density ≤4\) for the rituals \(throwing and praying\)  
4\. Sufficient passing area \(either side of the Jamarah\)  
5\. Sufficient departure capacity  
With these rules, we can test various design options. For that, we first  
develop numerical models in a spreadsheet—the example shown in Figure  
6.16, is from the Jamarat Project.  
This is a first-pass model in which there are various design options, where  
we can evaluate the design options. We use this to evaluate the question—  
does this design fulfill the design criteria? If it does not pass the numerical  
tests, we reject the design proposal. Once a design passes the numerical tests,  
we then \(and only then\) run a simulation to test the whole system. Figure  
6.17 shows the screen image of a simulation of the first tier of the New  
Jamarat Bridge.  
The numerical rules establish the fundamental design criteria. These  
rules do not give us information about design shape, congestion or poten-  
tial risks in key locations; flow diagrams and simulations provide these  
details for the analysis. It is essential to first develop a model of the fun-  
damental design criteria and system rules. When used in conjunction with  
fundamental models, a simulation can provide valuable insights for proj-  
ects of this level of complexity. The simulations are, in this case, used to  
evaluate the rates of passage, and potential for crushing. Not used to prove  
the system is safe for the pilgrims. 174 Introduction to crowd science

INGRESS—EGRESS \(SHARED SPACE\)—LOVE PARADE  
DISASTER  
At 4\:20 p.m. on the 24th of July 2010, 21 people died and 541 people were  
injured at the Love Parade in Duisburg. The site had a combined entry/exit  
system that resembled an inverted ‘T’ consisting of two tunnels \(East and  
West\) and a main ramp onto the site shown below. Consider the basic geom-  
etry of the site. Figure 6.18 was obtained by drawing over a site image, and  
indicates a pinch point, that there is a barrier on the ramp. Although the  
site plan indicates the entire width would be available for two-way flow, the  
reality was very different. Figure 6.18 does not highlight the risk.  
Figure 6.18  Diagram of the Love Parade entry/exit ramp showing a barrier on the ramp.  
This was a security gate and had been in place for several years. Internet-  
mapping tools clearly show this significant constraint. 176 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 6.19  Fundamental mode of the site, showing the crowd flow, constraint and con-  
vergence of the ingress/egress crowds. Checking this is sufficient for the  
crowd flow, you need to add the ingress crowd flow to the egress crowd  
flow due to the two-way nature of the crowd movement.  
Using only a simple line diagram, we can illustrate how the crowd  
was expected to enter and exit the site to highlight the specific nature  
of the risk in this section. The width at this narrow section, the barrier,  
was 10.59 m. In Figure 6.19, we have shown the crowd flow converging  
on the narrow section. The size of the arrows should indicate the situa-  
tion has significant risk and should raise concern about the feasibility of  
the site. The difference between Figures 6.18 and 6.19 is an important  
consideration. You need to evaluate how the crowds are going to move  
in the site, and then evaluate the numbers of people moving through the  
narrowest point and draw the risk diagram to highlight the potential for  
convergence as shown in Figure 6.19.  
An important consideration is that this section will have people mov-  
ing in both directions \(ingress plus egress\) and you need to add these two  
flows together to evaluate how many people this area will accommodate  
safely.  
Calculating crowd flow  
To assess the maximum capacity of any part of a system used for crowd  
movement, we apply a simple calculation. This was outlined in Chapter 2  
the maximum is 82 people per metre per minute, in line with international  
data-supporting rates of passage for pedestrian movements in places of  
public assembly.  
Figure 6.20 tells us that the optimal crowd movement \(flow\) conditions  
are two to three people per square metre. We have illustrated the indicative  
density diagrams on the graph. The Love Parade event plan site capacity Case studies and examples 177

is the consequence.  
was calculated at two people per square metre but as we highlighted in the  
previous chapters, this only serves as an overall site capacity and does not  
indicate any areas of static/standing or dynamic/moving crowds within the  
site, the entry and exit points or around various site attractions. The critical  
area is this point on the ramp, where two-way flow was expected and hence  
the area where density is most relevant, where risks will be the greatest, if  
the flow was to exceed the capacity of the narrowest point in the system.  
Ingress/egress  
The history of major accidents and incidents highlights that most incidents  
occur during ingress and egress. It is vital that crowd flow and crowd den-  
sity \(crowd risks\) are carefully considered for the process of ingress and  
egress system design and that during operations, these systems \(ingress and  
egress\) are monitored to avoid overcrowding. As we can see from Figure  
6.20 shows, when density exceeds three people per square metre, the crowd  
flow drops rapidly. This should be clearly understood by the crowd man-  
ager, namely, that to maintain safe ingress and egress at optimal flow rates,  
the crowd density should be maintained at levels lower than three people  
per square metre.  
In the British guidance documents, ‘safety at sports events’, the value of  
four people per square metre is stated as the upper limit for any queueing  
system, this refers to slower moving queues at entry/exit points. There are 178 Introduction to crowd science  
no specific details in these guides for the size of a queue, the duration of  
the wait and the inevitable buildup of crowd pressure. In other words, the  
risks are not outlined, it is just a single number for crowd flow. To highlight  
the potential risks involved at an entry system, consider this, the back of  
the queue can move forwards, and the front of the queue may be trapped  
against the entry gates. The design of an entry system must be based on  
matching the throughput of the entry system to the anticipated arrival pro-  
file \(how many people per minute per hour are expected to enter the site\).  
This arrival profile must be matched to the throughput of the entry system  
to prevent excessive crowd build up at the entry points. The same principle  
applies to any pinch points\* in the system. Failure to consider these relation-  
ships \(arrival profile and system throughput\) leads to crowd congestion,  
potential crushing and serious risk to life and limb for large crowds.  
Consider a system where people are approaching a pinch point \(or nar-  
row point\) at a fixed flow rate. If congestion occurs at the narrow point  
\(and this may be for any number of reasons\), then the rate of passage, the  
number of people per minute passing through the system at that narrow  
point will be reduced. This can quickly result in further increases in density  
and overcrowding/crushing as people arrive at that point faster than they  
can pass through that point.  
Love parade ramp pinch point  
The fundamental error is the system design, specifically the ramp con-  
straint. The ramp was 10.59 m wide at its narrowest point. This would  
allow, at best, 82 people per metre per minute  
×  
10.59 m  
=  
868.38 \(869\)  
people per minute  
=  
52,102.8 \(52,103\) people per hour. This system should  
have been rejected; is it a shared space, a two-way flow for both ingress and  
egress? There was an expected 145,000 people per hour peak flow; this is  
three times greater than the system limit.  
There are a number of YouTube video clips of the incident and in these,  
we can see the ramp and the pinch point from various angles. In these clips,  
the ramp system appears congested and the top of the ramp area appears  
to be full around 3 p.m. The entry points \(West and East\) were also full  
of people waiting to enter. The parade, scheduled to end at 1700, would  
result in an anticipated mass egress from the site. Furthermore, the crowds  
leaving the site would do so via the ramp and against the crowd flow antici-  
pated to enter at that time.  
To evaluate the throughput of the system and potential risk to the crowd  
should have been part of the site analysis, the total number of people  
expected to enter the system needs to be added to the total number of  
\*  
A pinch point is a narrow section in a system. Case studies and examples 179  
people exiting the system as parts of the ingress/egress system are two-way  
flow \(in plus out\).  
This calculation was not present in the event plan although the data  
clearly indicated the numbers expected over the entire day. If anyone in the  
event planning and event approval teams simply added the two numbers  
together \(ingress plus egress\) and performed the calculation of the maxi-  
mum flow rate at the narrowest part of the system, they would have, should  
have, questioned and then rejected this site design.  
Highlighted in Fruin ‘Causes and Prevention of Crowd Disasters \(1993\)’  
are the problems and risks associated with shared ingress/egress systems.  
Similar warnings about the risks of shared spaces appear in several interna-  
tional guidance documents for crowd safety. Risk awareness and simple site  
analysis should have been applied. This disaster should have been averted,  
and the knowledge was neither new nor novel.  
EGRESS—CONGESTION—LONDON NEW YEAR  
EVENT \(FIREWORKS\)  
In many capital cities around the world, a public fireworks display marks a  
celebration of the New Year. These events are spectacular, typically hosted  
in urban environment and will attract large crowds. The London New  
Year Event was subject to a workshop in 2006 following a near miss, dur-  
ing which several members of the public were injured at the entrance to a  
London Underground station \(Westminster\). The station is very close to  
the event and, when the fireworks had successfully concluded, the crowd  
left the site and entered the station. The area became congested and the  
station management made the decision to close the station entrance, to pre-  
vent congestion on the platforms. At that time, there were several thousand  
people outside the station trying to get in and the inevitable crowd crush  
developed.  
Crowd crushing  
In these kinds of situations, a semi-circular crowd forms around the  
entrance and pressure builds at the centre of the semi-circle. To understand  
this kind of environment, and to illustrate how to identify this type of prob-  
lem, we shall model that part of the site. This is one of the examples we use  
in the workshops to demonstrate how to present a site issue to a layperson.  
This case study follows the typical event modelling analysis in which  
we would start with an overview of the site, then a video or photograph  
of the problem. This sets the scene for the audience, showing the site, the  
problems and risks, to position the key issues in the audience’s mind. We  
would then demonstrate how to a construct a site model to highlight the 180 Introduction to crowd science  
cause of the problem. Finally, the solution is modelled. This specific proj-  
ect was created in the workshop, then presented to the London authori-  
ties and the solution was deployed, and used. For this case study, we will  
use a similar script to the one we used during the workshops, and it has  
proven to be effective in demonstrating the modelling approach to this  
kind of problem.  
1\. Set the scene  
It is important to present the scene for the audience; they may not come  
from the same background, or have the same depth of knowledge of the  
site, its issues or operational requirements. To do this, you must not start a  
presentation with a complex site diagram, map or plan. We have found the  
best approach for positioning an event problem to a layperson is begin with  
an overview. Figure 6.21 shows the site we are going to review. The centre  
of the image is the Millennium Eye on the river Thames, in London. The  
bridge to the bottom of the image is Westminster Bridge and on the lower  
left-hand side are the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.  
This should orientate the audience with the location \(there are a variety  
of Internet-mapping tools that will assist in this process\). The fireworks  
display focussed on the Millennium Eye, a large Ferris wheel on the river  
Thames. The best viewing area for the fireworks is the embankment on the  
opposite side of the river \(the left-hand side of Figure 6.21\). At the end of  
the fireworks, we have a congestion problem.  
Figure 6.21  Image of the event site for the London New Year Event. Case studies and examples 181  
2\. Show the problem  
We are going to model the section to the lower left of Figure 6.21, the  
area where the crowd leaves the embankment area and departs the site.  
This image is from a Police helicopter, it is inverted infrared, black is the  
hotter area; so, the darker the image, the more people are present in that  
space.  
In Figure 6.22 \(we have several minutes of footage of this specific loca-  
tion\) shows very high density crowds and the station \(near the middle of  
Figure 6.22\) has to be closed due to overcrowding on the platforms. The  
outer gates are shut, people approaching the site cannot see the problem  
ahead; so, the pressure builds up and there were several serious injuries \(13  
people with arms, legs and soft-tissue injuries\).  
We will now show the area in question and construct a model of this area  
to understand the crowd movements at that time \(egress\).  
3\. Build a model  
Figure 6.23 shows the section of the site that is of most concern. The outline  
of Big Ben is seen to the bottom left-hand side of the image. The white lines  
are the model outlines showing the embankment and Westminster Bridge.  
The crowd, tens of thousands of people in this section \(along the embank-  
ment and on Westminster Bridge\) are heading away from the area, and many  
are heading towards Westminster station or across the bridge to Waterloo  
station. This is the section we observe in the video clip \(Figure 6.22\).

Figure 6.23  Diagram of the area of concern.  
The area around Westminster station is very congested and is a cause for  
concern. Figure 6.24 shows the area of concern, outlined on the underlying  
diagram \(this is where the tracing paper helps define the basic geometry\).  
When we remove the underlying map, we are left with the diagram show in  
Figure 6.25. This is the basic model of the area of concern.  
Figure 6.24  Outline of the area of concern. The model is shown on the image as darker  
lines. Case studies and examples 183  
Figure 6.25  Model of the area is obtained by removing all the background detail. If you  
use the baking sheet approach, you have drawn this model on the baking  
sheet. In this example, we have drawn lines on a site plan in Powerpoint, and  
then removed the background image.  
4\. Remove the background  
We remove the background and are left with the basic outline of the  
site, the key area where we need to focus our efforts to find an appropri-  
ate solution to the congestion problem during egress. We do not need  
a scale, as this process is a review of the crowd movements. In Figure  
6.25, we are going to add lines/arrows to indicate all the different crowd  
movements.  
The crowd can move from the right to the left \(Waterloo station\), and  
from the bridge \(top\) to the bottom \(this direction will take the crowd  
towards Victoria Station\). The crowd can move from the embankment  
area to either Waterloo station or Victoria Station \(leaving the site\). Finally,  
from all three directions \(bottom, top and to the left\), the crowd can move  
towards the station. Figure 6.26 shows all these movements. We would  
Figure 6.26  Model of the crowd movements \(lines\) in this area \(during egress\), showing  
convergence on the Westminster underground station. 184 Introduction to crowd science  
normally explain each direction, which displays the specific line/arrow; this  
helps the audience understand the crowd movements as there are many dif-  
ferent directions involved and building the model, step by step, can be very  
useful for presentation.  
5\. How does the crowd move in this area?  
As described above, the lines in Figure 6.26 shows all the possible direc-  
tions of crowd movement. When you couple this with a video clip, the  
audience appreciates the complexity and understands the risk; more  
importantly, the audience understands the relationship of crowd move-  
ment and congestion.  
We include a graphic of the station entrance in Figure 6.26; again, this  
helps the audience understand the site and the congestion problems. This  
process is focussed towards orientation of a complex crowd movement, at  
a specific time \(egress\) to an audience who may not have first-hand knowl-  
edge of the site or area in question.  
As you can see Figure 6.26, there are many lines crossing and converging  
on the station entrance from three different directions \(180% approach\).  
The number of people who leave the event and try to access the stations  
exceeds the stations capacity; there are more people trying to enter the  
underground system than the system can move on the underground train  
systems. There is a significant risk of crushing on the station platforms.  
This mismatch of arrival rate \(the rate at which people arrive at part of a  
system\) and the departure rate \(the number of people who can leave the sys-  
tem by the underground system\) leads to a queue. To prevent congestion on  
the underground, the station gates are shut and the queue quickly develops  
into a crush outside the station.  
We need to stress that people approaching this station cannot see the  
gates are closed; even as a public address \(PA\) announcement is made, the  
180% approach angle makes this space difficult to manage and as there is  
no route to alleviate the pressure. There are solid walls, buildings, on both  
sides of the station entrance. We need to understand the crowd’s objectives  
in the space. The station is where people are heading; we can remove that  
objective by shutting the station. We need to inform the crowd of this and  
we cannot do that during or at the end of the event. We must inform the  
crowd before the event.  
We announce \(in the station, on notice boards and in the local media/TV/  
press\) that no one can access the station after 9 p.m. The station will shut  
down at 9 p.m. and it will remain closed for the rest of the event. This pre-con-  
ditions the crowd behaviour; the aim is to utilise Waterloo station and Victoria  
Station for the departing crowds. These two stations are not too far from the  
site and, as the crowds leave, they will be moving into wider spaces; so, there  
will be less congestion and hence less risk. By closing Westminster station, we Case studies and examples 185  
Figure 6.27  Model of the proposed \(and later adopted\) solution to reducing the com-  
plexity and congestion of this area.  
remove the problem of station congestion. We still have multi-directional flow  
in this area and a further measure will remove that issue.  
The idea was to block off Westminster Bridge, allowing it to fill from the  
top \(from Waterloo station\) and not allow public access to this area from  
the Houses of Parliament/Big Ben side of the bridge. This would require the  
media \(TV/local press, station announcements, what’s on in London, Twitter  
and Facebook information\) to ensure that the public knew of the site entry  
and layout. Figure 6.27 shows the proposed changes, these were adopted in  
2006 and are still in use for the London New Year Fireworks Event.  
6\. Making the area safer  
Figure 6.28 shows the crowd movement with these two measures in place,  
closing Westminster station at 9 p.m. and placing a barrier\* at the Big Ben  
side of Westminster Bridge.

\*  
The barrier can be removed in an emergency. 186 Introduction to crowd science  
During the workshop, the delegate \(a police commander\) did not apply  
any mathematics, the line diagrams illustrated the problem and communi-  
cated the concern and solution, to the audience. The line diagram does all  
the work. You cannot see the cause of the congestion in the video. But you  
can see the crowd flow, the cause of the congestion problem in the crowd  
flow lines and diagrams.  
EGRESS—CROWD MANAGEMENT—WEMBLEY  
WHITE HORSE BRIDGE  
We produced a report and analysis on the proposed White Horse Bridge  
\(Wembley Stadium, London, UK\), which included the barrier design and  
operations for crowd management during egress. This was a complex envi-  
ronment, as we needed to regulate crowd flow for North- and South-bound  
trains, allow a throughput and maintain a segregated area for the occa-  
sional VVIP\* transport \(they often had special train arrangements\). The  
area had a number of items of street furniture \(chairs and trees\), which  
we had to accommodate in the design. These non-removable items would  
enhance the space for non-event days. The specification was to design a  
system that could assist in egress crowd management. It had to be a flexible  
design suitable for many different types of events, for example, concerts  
and sports events.  
Using the DIM-ICE principles, we needed to consider the design for four  
different users \(North bound, South bound, passing through and VVIPS\).  
We need to consider the information requirements for North- and South-  
bound passengers and we need to minimise the number of stewards/mar-  
shals operating the system. During the early research years, we had worked  
at Wembley stadium; so, we understood both the departing crowd profile  
\(time to empty the stadium\) and the demands on the rail station. The site  
was close to the stadium and some 10–20,000 people would often be seen  
to queue for several hours while departing a major event.  
Barrier design  
We noted that the ratio of people travelling to North and South was sel-  
dom 50\:50; in fact, the ratios were typically 70\:30– 80\:20. We extracted  
that information from ticket sales from the train-operating companies and  
it provided the first important element of the barrier design. We needed  
a big queueing space and a smaller queueing space that we could switch,  
depending on the demand at that specific event. We also need to regulate  
crowd flow onto the platform to prevent overcrowding and the potential for

incidents as trains pulled into the station. Figure 6.29 shows the design we  
proposed and adopted.  
The two entry points would be signed as North and South depending  
on the anticipated demand. This information was available from train-operating  
company ticket sales and became part of the operational proce-  
dures. We could simply switch the North/South sign on the day. A steward  
at the entry point would assist people getting into the correct queue. The  
shaded section \(middle, bottom of Figure 6.29\) is the area that holds enough  
people to fill a train.  
We are queueing both the North- and South-bound passengers on the  
entry to the bridge. This simplified the marshalling arrangements as we were  
allowing a trainload of people onto the platform at a time. Once the train  
leaves, we allow another trainload of people onto the platform. By simplify-  
ing the operations, we reduce the risk of overcrowding on the platform. We  
will return to this specific site in the next chapter, and control room applica-  
tions, to outline how we managed the crowds after events.  
SUMMARY  
We began this chapter by evaluating the existing risk assessment process,  
how information is lost in the process and the common working practices of 188 Introduction to crowd science  
‘cut and paste’ fail to register with the crowd planners, approval or licensing  
officers and crowd managers. In turn this process fails to provide sufficient  
information to reduce, mitigate or act upon many risks. The process can be  
significantly enhanced using simple line diagrams and crowd models. We  
have outlined some of the many applications of RAMP analysis, and how  
comparative analysis, using diagrams with lines and arrows to represent  
crowd flow, can communicate key crowd risks. We have found that, when  
you begin to incorporate these models into your event documents, the event  
process \(planning, approval and operations\) is clearer for all parties, it aids  
understanding and it helps focus the users on the key issues.  
We could fill several books with case study examples from past and on-  
going projects, the examples in this chapter will give you some ideas on  
how to apply the RAMP and DIM-ICE approach to events. For further  
examples and information, coupled to an eLearning system where you can

INTRODUCTION  
When you are in charge of an event, you are responsible for the safety and  
welfare of every individual that attends your event. You are responsible for  
preventing all reasonably foreseeable incidents that may affect your crowd.  
You have a moral, ethical and legal responsibility for understanding all  
aspects of crowd risks. You need to provide a safe environment for the  
crowd attending your event and if you review the history of fatal incidents  
and mass fatalities around the world, you will note that the potential for  
injury and specifically for loss of life is an ever-present threat to your crowd.  
Although we have focussed on the planning and approval phase of the  
event process, if we assume the event plan is a robust document, there are  
still wide ranges of potential issues that can develop during the operation  
phase of the event. This chapter focusses on those issues, specifically on  
crowd monitoring and incident detection from a control room perspective.  
We have, throughout this book, demonstrated that the application of  
relatively simple and inexpensive modelling techniques can make a signifi-  
cant impact on our understanding of crowd risks. In this chapter, we will  
outline how those modelling techniques can assist in the control during the  
event. The visual mapping process can help the crowd safety manager, the  
police and other persons in the control room in understanding the event as  
it develops.  
189 190 Introduction to crowd science  
The objective of these modelling tools is to improve our understanding  
of crowd risks and to make the users more aware of the potential for crowd  
harm. In the previous chapters, we highlighted that risks are often design  
related, where the flow rate of the approaching crowds exceeds the capac-  
ity of a site component or throughput element \(such as an entry system\).  
In layperson’s terms, when crowds fill spaces too quickly or where entry  
points are not operating fast enough for the crowds to flow into the system,  
there will be problems.  
The fundamentals of calculating crowd flow, assessing the arrival rate  
\(the profile\), should be a core skill of the event planner and event licensing  
authority. It should also be a core skill in the control room. Staff may take  
up their position, and rely on the event planning process to have either  
eliminated or reduced the risk, or made the control team aware of the risks.  
In the previous chapter, we outlined how the risk assessment process may  
not transmit the relevant information in a way that can be quickly, and  
clearly, understood. Obviously, this can be an important factor for early  
detection of a risk; a process that is called ‘red flagging’, namely how are  
the early indicators of a crowd risk communicated from the field to the con-  
trol room, assessed and acted upon. One could argue that if an event begins  
to fail, whether this is due to a poor plan, or a significant deviation from the  
plan, then these early indicators are the last line of defence for crowd safety.  
It follows that risk awareness, understanding how the site should operate,  
is a safety-critical function.\*  
Site check  
It is always recommended that a site check is performed on the day of the  
event, to ensure that there is no significant deviation from the plan. This  
check should include a review of the risk analysis. A final walk around is  
a check to assess if the site is safe and the value of this check should not be  
underestimated. We have observed many events where last-minute changes  
have created significant operational challenges. We have seen generators  
appear in the last few minutes before an event starts, blocking emergency  
access and egress routes. Obviously, this kind of last-minute change can sig-  
nificantly alter the event safety and inevitable liabilities, if an incident occurs.  
As we stated at the start of this section, when you are in charge of an event,  
you are responsible for the safety and welfare of every individual that attends  
your event.  
There will be many readers who will think ‘That is obvious’; however,  
having worked in many events, reviewed many event plans and acted as  
an expert witness on several cases, where this has been a singular point of  
\*  
The phrase ‘never assume—it makes an ass out of U and me’ is most certainly a truism. Control room applications 191  
failure. Teams can be aware of the increase in risks, due to site changes, but  
will proceed with the event regardless.  
Crowd safety  
Crowd safety is a legal responsibility and failure to provide a safe environ-  
ment can result in prosecution. Crowd safety is not an ideology, and it is  
not a belief system; safety is a fundamental human right, the right to life\:  
In 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence declared that  
all men are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that ‘among  
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’.  
In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the  
United Nations General Assembly, declared in article three\: ‘Everyone  
has the right to life, liberty and security of person’.  
In 1950, the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted  
by the Council of Europe, declaring a protected human right to life in  
Article 2.  
In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  
was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. ‘Every human  
being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by  
law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life’. \(Article 6.1 of the  
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\)  
Failure to provide a safe environment, not just within your event but also  
for the crowds entering and leaving your event, is a fundamental breach of  
your duty of care to the public. Although different countries have different  
guidance and legislation, to operate an event that has significant risk and to  
fail to understand or act upon that risk may be gross negligence. The consci-  
entious application of crowd risk analysis and safety engineering principles  
applies to the planning, approval and operational phases of the event process.  
Yet, we are always hearing of near misses in the teaching/training workshops,  
usually with a ‘this could have been another Hillsborough or Love Parade  
disaster’ comment. So, how do we make positive changes to the industry to  
improve the situation? Specifically, how do we improve control room aware-  
ness? One frequent question we are asked is\: ‘What are the early warning  
signs of a crowd problem?’  
INCIDENT DETECTION  
It is worth looking at a generic model of an event from a different perspec-  
tive to understand the concept of crisis management and where modelling  
fits into the process. It is essential to understand the cost/benefit analysis 192 Introduction to crowd science  
of an event that goes wrong and where early incident detection sits in the  
spectrum of costs.  
Four pillars of crisis management  
The four pillars of crisis management outline the pre- and post-incident  
cost analysis. The four pillars are defined as ‘anticipate’, ‘prepare/prevent’,  
‘respond’ and ‘recover’. Each pillar has a cost to implement and the overall  
event cost rises considerably when an incident occurs.  
Obviously, the objective is to prevent accidents/incidents from occurring.  
To achieve this goal, there must be some investment in the first two pil-  
lars \(anticipate, prepare/prevent\) of the planning process. There must also  
be investment in monitoring and early detection of incidents to facilitate  
successful intervention. Not surprisingly, the early detection of problems  
is closely linked to understanding crowd risks and how quickly they can  
develop into major incidents. The sole purpose of risk assessment and crowd  
management, of planning is to anticipate, prepare and prevent accidents or  
incidents from occurring. Deploying the appropriate resources to facilitate  
a rapid response and emergency/incident management will minimise this  
potential cost/exposure—but this has an associated cost. Obviously, pre-  
vention is the most cost-effective solution.  
Figure 7.1 indicates the relatively low cost of planning compared to the  
rapidly escalating cost of an incident, which will include irreparable brand  
damage, lawsuits and the historical association of a disaster to your brand.

Figure 7.1  The four pillars of crisis management showing the cost escalation due to an  
incident. Brand exposure will be irreparably damaged if there are serious  
injuries or fatalities at an event, especially if these are avoidable. Control room applications 193  
For example, the Love Parade disaster is associated with the city of Duisburg.  
As a brand and a city, it is now associated with the mass fatalities at the event.  
The graph in Figure 7.1 shows that the cost increases considerably when an  
incident occurs. The scale on the vertical axis \(cost\) includes damage to the  
brand and reputation damage, resource costs plus litigation costs. If you have  
ever expressed concern about the cost of public liability insurance, Figure 7.1  
will give you some perspective on the outlay in the event of an incident.  
Obviously, the objective is to prevent crowd accidents or incidents from  
developing and there is a need to invest time and resources in the ‘antici-  
pate’ and ‘prepare/prevent’ elements, which is why we have emphasised  
the need for a more conscientious approach to risk analysis for crowds and  
events. Modelling helps in the first two pillars \(‘anticipate’ and ‘prepare/  
prevent’\) simply because it is cost effective.  
Global problem  
Around the world, the events industry operates on the same principle,  
minimum-wage staff, cost control, profit-driven focus and stories of near  
misses. Major events will often tender for a security or stewarding com-  
pany to deliver the manpower for events, driving costs \(and hence margins\)  
as low as possible during contract negotiations. These financial limitations  
create further problems. The event documentation is easily copied from  
past events; risk assessments can be ‘cut and paste’. If the last event plan  
was approved, copying it and submitting it again for a different event is a  
lower-cost option to creating a new event plan for each event. This element  
of cost reduction is endemic in the industry and it is compounded due to the  
onerous nature of compiling a new risk assessment for each new event. We  
stress that if the event and crowd management plan are ‘cut and paste’ from  
an older plan, it opens the organisation to claims of negligence if something  
goes wrong during the event.  
Subcontracting  
It can often be the case that the event planner will subcontract a stewarding or  
security company for the function of crowd management at a major event. In  
many cases, this means the subcontracting company is tasked with producing  
the crowd management plan and risk assessment. Obviously, this should be an  
integrated approach to the overall event plan, working with the subcontracts  
to understand the overall site risks and crowd management strategies.  
One problem that we have noted is that if control rooms are manned  
by staff who have had no part in the planning or approval processes, and  
who are given the event plan, expected to read and understand it, and  
then expected to manage the event safely, the reliance on the event and  
crowd management plan is paramount. In those cases, where the crowd 194 Introduction to crowd science  
management team is not part of the planning or approval process, the clar-  
ity of the event plan, specifically the crowd management plan, is a vital  
communication element for the safe and successful operation of an event.  
Specifically, the risk analysis and how that information relating to risk  
management is communicated to the control room team.  
It is not enough to hire an experienced team and hope for the best. There  
will be unique characteristics to every event and the crowd management  
plan and the risk analysis needs to both capture and communicate those  
features of the site that need specific attention. Furthermore, the crowd  
management experience in one environment may not be relevant to a dif-  
ferent environment. For example, the experience of managing a football  
crowd may not be relevant to a concert crowd at the same venue, or the  
experience of the crowd management process in one stadium may not apply  
to different stadiums’ geometry or crowd behaviour. It is a common mis-  
take we see across the industry, in every country.  
It is vital that the event planning \(and approval\) process considers the  
control room experience and ability to read and understand the crowd  
management plan. Engaging with the subcontracting company, early in the  
planning process, and validating that they have read the crowd manage-  
ment plan, have both understood and can deliver to this plan, is essential.  
Contractors who ‘turn up on the day’, who do not attend briefings and who  
take the attitude of ‘we know this stuff’ may expose the crowd to opera-  
tional risks.  
CONTROL ROOM  
The larger the event \(or crowd\), the more the consideration that needs to be  
given to the control room element of the event operations. Control rooms  
or event liaison teams \(ELTs\) require space to function. The location, con-  
struction, management and information systems with respect to crowd safety  
are all factors that may need to be considered. Control room staff roles  
and responsibilities, command and control structure, site knowledge, staff  
training, resource deployment, CCTV and radio communications are part  
of a long list of items that are essential for safe and efficient control room  
operations.  
Recognise the risk  
Hindsight is a wonderful thing; everyone can see the problems and solu-  
tions with hindsight. When we review past incidents, we note that one  
of the significant weaknesses in both the Hillsborough and Love Parade  
disasters was the inability of the crowd management team to recognise  
the crowd risks during the event and act in a timely manner to avert the Control room applications 195  
disaster. As we outlined in the previous chapters, the near misses are not  
recorded, experience is lost when key individuals change position, and  
information is neither captured nor disseminated across the industry. One  
of our objectives is to change that process and outline a set of best practices  
with the aim of improving crowd safety. Without a process of capturing  
and disseminating crowd risk analysis and best practices for major events,  
it is inevitable that major incidents will recur.  
Location of a control room is essential; a control room must have infor-  
mation from the event to function effectively. For example, lines of sight  
from the control room, whether via windows or CCTV, must be considered  
before the event starts. What the control room can see will influence their  
decision-making process and this can be the most important input during  
an event. We have seen many event plans that state ‘a control room will be  
available at location X, Y for the duration of the event’ or something simi-  
lar; yet they fail to recognise the importance of lines of sight, CCTV inputs  
and the importance of these for effective command and control decision-  
making and communication strategies.  
How the control room functions during the event is an obvious, yet some-  
times underestimated, component of the event risk analysis. In effect, the  
control room receives a range of information, processes this information,  
makes decisions and then sends out information for others to act upon dur-  
ing the event. The quality of those decisions is directly related to the way  
the staff in the control room can prioritise the information. Having worked  
in many different types of event control rooms, from the very simple to  
the highly sophisticated, we have observed many complex computer-aided  
decision support tools, and that many computerised systems integration  
is both a complex process and often unnecessary. Understanding the risk  
assessment, specifically the time, location, duration and potential sever-  
ity of the risks, is vital to risk management, and the design criteria of the  
modelling tools described in this book are aimed at assisting that control  
room function. Site diagrams and risk maps are visual aids and are a simple  
addition to an existing system in a control room.  
Best-laid plans  
Assuming we start with an excellent plan, one that has been checked and  
is fit for its intended purpose, it may be useless if the operational team has  
neither participated in its development nor read and understood the event  
plan. A poorly trained, poorly informed crowd management team could  
induce risks irrespective of the depth of safety considerations in the plan-  
ning and approval process. In other words, you can still mess up an event if  
you do not understand the event plan.  
The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men,  
Gang aft agley, 196 Introduction to crowd science  
An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,  
For promis’d joy! \(Robert Burns, To a Mouse, 1785\)\*  
To paraphrase Rabbie Burns, the best-laid plans can still go wrong. It is  
vital that the crowd management plan is considered as a conduit for trans-  
ferring information from the event planning process to the event operations  
process with the objective of minimising risks, specifically if the opera-  
tions team is subcontracted. In our experience, an event plan that contains  
more diagrams is generally easier to understand. Which is why we focus on  
developing crowd management plan, including diagrams/presentation and  
communication strategies in our workshop training programmes, using  
diagrams to aid the understanding of crowd risks.  
Other side of the table  
If you are a security or stewarding company, you should not accept an event  
contract unless the plan is fit for its intended purpose, and that the site is  
suitable for the event. You should avoid event organisers that will not engage  
with you during the planning process, specifically if they are cost conscious  
and constantly trying to reduce staffing for safety-critical functions.  
If you accept a contract, you should read and ensure that you understand  
the event plan and, specifically, the crowd management plan. It is rela-  
tively simple to construct the appropriate diagrams from a written plan and  
we always recommend that this process should be part of contract accep-  
tance. You can expose your organisation, the event and the crowd to risks  
if you focus only on profit and not on understanding the potential event  
risks. Your primary duty of care, during event operations, is ensuring that  
the event runs to plan; so, it is vital that the plan is read, understood and  
actioned accordingly. This all sounds like common sense, but we are con-  
stantly surprised at the number of events, specifically those that go wrong,  
that can be attributed to lack of appropriate preparation.  
Subcontracting a security company, a group that may not be involved in  
the planning of an event, has obvious potential risks. So, from the event  
organiser’s perspective, the first element must be to ensure that the subcon-  
tracting company has thoroughly read and understood the event plan. Do  
not make this a ‘tick here if you have read the event plan’ exercise. Spend  
time making sure the site is understood, make sure the capacity, flow,  
usage, arrival profile, crowd nature and behaviour are agreed upon with  
the subcontractor, and the subcontractor can provide adequate resources  
for the event. Bear in mind that the industry is a minimum-wage, cost man-  
agement business and that corners may \(will\) be cut wherever possible. The  
\*  
Translation—The best-laid schemes of Mice and Men oft go awry, And leave us nothing  
but grief and pain, For promised joy! Control room applications 197  
consequences of failure, where crowds may be injured, are too great to  
ignore. As we have stated previously, during the workshops, we always ask  
‘how many here have had a close call?’ and ‘how many people here have  
read the risk assessment?’ It may come as no surprise that the vast majority  
of delegates admit to one or other of these oversights or short cuts.  
As we have taught the principles and applications for crowd and event  
modelling, the common feature is how rarely the event plan, safety concept,  
risk assessment and risk management process is considered as a principle  
method of analysis. More often than not, event plans are largely ‘cut and  
paste’, so the errors, misconceptions and risks remain problems ‘lying in  
wait’ for the next time.  
The analysis of risk starts in the plan should be checked in the approval  
process and checked again by the operational team on the day of the event.  
We have observed many times that elements appear on the day of the event  
that did not feature in the event plan. For example, mobile generators  
blocking or severely restricting entry/exit points. All routes that the crowds  
use, specifically if these routes are used frequently during the event need to  
be kept clear of obstructions; this should include the entry and exit systems,  
interface to the local transport infrastructure and crowd management  
resources. The competitive nature of the tendering process, where a com-  
pany is contracted into an event to provide crowd management resources,  
must not compromise crowd safety. Provision of adequately trained staff,  
in sufficient numbers, is one important element that simply cannot be com-  
promised for a major event. This applies to both parties in the contract, as  
the saying goes, ‘pay peanuts and you will get monkeys’. Ultimately, the  
duty of care to public safety is the event organiser’s responsibility, and that  
responsibility is not discharged to a sub-contractor.  
Plan, prepare, prevent  
If the event organiser has created an event and crowd management plan  
that is fit for its intended purpose, and the approval process has checked  
the plan and licenced \(or permitted\) the event. There are a range of ele-  
ments, specifically any sudden changes in the weather, which can give rise  
to operational problems. Obviously, the plan should have considerations  
for potential problems and how they should be managed during the event.  
We would argue that a thoroughly researched event plan should have con-  
tingency elements for all reasonably foreseeable considerations. All rea-  
sonably anticipated incidents should have a contingency plan and there  
should be nothing unexpected during the event. We often hear the phrase  
‘to expect the unexpected’ but this is, of course, an oxymoron.\* What is  
\*  
An apparent contradiction of terms, how can we expect the unexpected when it is, by defi-  
nition, not predictable? 198 Introduction to crowd science  
essential is that the combination of thorough planning and efficient execu-  
tion of the crowd management plan will manage the potential risks for  
all reasonably foreseeable risks, a fundamental issue, the definition of  
reasonably foreseeable. Only when the crowd risk assessment process is  
improved, when we have an accessible collation of near misses and stan-  
dards of competency defined, will the ‘Phew! We were lucky that time’  
moments be reduced.  
The process of training, desktop exercises and working with multi-  
agency teams can all help prepare for the event specifically if there is a focus  
on modelling how incidents can develop with an emphasis on crowd risk  
analysis. There are, of course, many other potential risks, such as ensuring  
that all temporary demountable structures are built to code, but those are  
beyond the scope of this book, there are experts in those types of specific  
risks, such as site construction, and we recommend the reader is well versed  
in all elements of event planning and safety.  
UNDERSTANDING CROWD DYNAMICS  
In the control room, if an incident does occur, one that may not be reason-  
ably foreseeable, you must be able to recognise, respond and recover from  
that incident promptly and efficiently. Specifically, you need to have the  
resources to be able to respond to an incident; to understand how the crowd  
may react to incidents as they unfold. Understanding how quickly crowd  
density can develop, understanding the risks of shockwaves in high-density  
situations and understanding crowd flow and how quickly areas can fill  
and potentially fail \(become dangerously overcrowding\) should be part  
of the crowd manager’s training. Failing to provide adequate emergency  
facilities can be perceived as negligent or reckless. In our experience, this is  
rarely the case as there is no requirement for core competency in many of  
the techniques described in this book. The low-margin, low-cost nature of  
the industry means that training is often neglected, record keeping is poor  
and, specifically, industry-wide knowledge sharing is non-existent.  
Planning, approval and operations  
The event process, as we have outlined, consists of a planning phase, an  
approval phase and an operational phase. In the previous chapters, we have  
focussed on the planning and approval applications of crowd/event risk  
analysis and crowd/event modelling. The objectives of modelling is to under-  
stand potentially complex environments and, in doing so, to develop better  
control mechanisms. We build models to help us discover aspects of the  
event that may not be clear in written documents, or that may only exist as  
personal experience. The process of modelling is a process of ­ discovery; this Control room applications 199  
helps us understand, and through that understanding, we can implement the  
appropriate controls to maintain safe and orderly crowds.  
There are many advantages of using these types of model during the  
operational phase of the event. Specifically, we use models designed to indi-  
cate the location, duration and severity of risks in the control room to assist  
the decision-making process during an event. To achieve this, we must  
ensure that these models are simple to understand and relate to situations  
as they develop in real time. Although this is no substitute for experience, it  
does help capture and communicate experience from operator to operator,  
event to event and site to site.  
Firstly, it is important to stress that even a good event plan, a plan that  
has been checked and approved and is fit for its intended purpose, can still  
go wrong due to mismanagement. For example, an entry system that is not  
fully manned as defined in the event plan will obviously not be as efficient  
during ingress. If fewer people gain entry than planned, queues will develop.  
This can then lead to excessive queueing and a potential pressure building  
up at the entry point. That would be a ‘management’ failure rather than a  
design failure. The design was OK, but it was not managed appropriately.  
Equally, a poorly designed entry system can be managed safely if the  
risks are identified during the operational phase early enough to intervene.  
For this specific example \(entry system design and operations\), it is essen-  
tial that the system capacity \(throughput\), the arrival profile, the potential  
crowd profile/behaviour are known to the control room operators. Without  
knowing how the entry system should perform, what the ingress rate should  
be, and how large the crowd/queue may develop, the control room opera-  
tors and crowd management team will not recognise escalating risks.  
As the history of accidents and incidents shows, the majority of injuries  
occur during ingress/egress. Therefore, we must be extra vigilant at those  
times during an event. Models, specifically diagrams, can assist us in iden-  
tifying if everything is going to plan. There are a number of ways of achiev-  
ing this and we will use the entry system as an example of how to assess  
risks during the ingress phase of the event operations.  
Entry system  
The miscalculating \(or missed calculation\) of ingress/egress rates were fac-  
tors in both the Hillsborough \(1989, the UK, 96 dead, 400 injured\) and  
Love Parade \(2010, Germany, 21 dead, 541 injured\) disasters. We outlined  
in Chapter 2 how crowd density effects flow rates; this is an important  
element in the design considerations for ingress/egress and any parts of an  
event where crowds are moving in multiple directions. It should be obvious  
from this that an efficient ingress system should not result in higher density  
as this will reduce flow rate and increase risk. If an ingress queue begins to  
develop high-density crowding, then something must be going wrong! 200 Introduction to crowd science  
High-density crowds should be a clear indicator of risk, specifically in  
any part of an event site that is predominately utilised for moving crowds.  
All parties involved in the event crowd management need to understand  
the relationship between crowd movement, crowd density and the potential  
for overcrowding and crushing. We have illustrated, through case studies,  
how these should be addressed in the planning and approval phases of the  
event process. If these are observed during an event, there may be very little  
time to react to the situation, specifically if there is a trip, slip or fall in high  
density. Where we have deployed flow and risk models, graphics and visual  
reminders, in the control room, it aids operational understanding.  
In the control room, several models can assist in understanding the safe  
density, the site risks and the expected rates of passage. We developed visu-  
als aids, some as simple red/orange/green indicators on large-scale maps.  
In several control room applications, a flip chart can be used. Simply copy  
the crowd flow and risk maps for each phase of the event, for example, the  
ingress, circulation and egress maps, each showing the location of expected  
crowd movement/density and/or risk. Control rooms can be small spaces  
or large rooms with multi-agency teams working on computers and CCTV/  
monitors, but there is always space to pin a diagram to a wall, or have a pad  
by your desk to aid understanding of how the event will unfold.  
Figure 7.2 shows an image from the Sydney Olympics control room. In the  
centre, there is a model \(in this case, back-projected onto a large screen\). We  
were involved in the conceptual design of this system, including modelling  
Figure 7.2  The control room at the Sydney Olympics showing the CCTV images of  
the event alongside the event model \(centre of the far wall\). The model was  
showing the expected crowd movements. The control room team could  
compare the model \(expectation\) to the CCTV \(real-time images\) and help  
make critical decisions for crowd management. \(From John Webster, Sydney  
Olympics project project files—GKStill.\) Control room applications 201  
the entire site over the entire event duration. This was then coded into an  
Excel spreadsheet, updated and displayed throughout the event. Figure 7.3  
shows one of the maps, indicating the anticipated crowd movements at a  
specific hour during the event. This used five colours \(green, blue, yellow,  
orange and red\), to indicate the expected crowd density. The visual nature  
of this diagram, updated for key times during the games, provided valuable  
insights for the control room team and the model was compared to the  
CCTV monitors, as a visual check of the current situation relating to crowd  
movements on the Olympic park.  
This model gave the control room operators an expectation \(the colours  
on the model, indicating crowd flow\) and the CCTV images \(the reality\). It  
helped them understand the overall site dynamics and they could check if  
the site was operating to plan. The system read information the cells of the  
spreadsheet, each of which indicated the loading and unloading of venues  
and how the routes between the various venues would populate during the  
periods between events \(change-over\).  
Figure 7.3  The plan of the common domain of the Sydney Olympics site. \(From John  
Webster, Sydney Olympics project files—GKStill.\) 202 Introduction to crowd science  
Simple systems  
The Sydney Olympics model was a spreadsheet model that would display  
the colours during operations. Simpler systems, for smaller events, use the  
same principle although it is more cost effective to produce these as a series  
of paper site plans rather than computerised versions with projected dis-  
plays. We have advised and installed many similar systems that display the  
extent of the crowd movements, expected congestion, \(marked as areas on  
a map or site plan\), the severity of the risk \(red–orange–green indicators of  
expected crowd density\) and the duration of the risk.  
Modelling ingress systems  
Without some form of model of the ingress system, you may find it dif-  
ficult to judge the efficiency of the queueing system during operations. We  
always advise that operations staff should have some clear indications of  
the expected arrival profile \(how many people will arrive over what period  
of time\) and the subsequent queue management strategy. For major events  
where a large number of people may be arriving over a short period, some  
queueing will be expected. Understanding, in advance, the location, dura-  
tion, extent and potential crowd congestion will assist in the operational  
management of the entry system.  
If you are creating an event plan, ingress flow rates should be calcu-  
lated and factored into the plan accompanied with appropriate diagrams  
for approval and for operations. When developing these plans indicate, in  
the diagram, the area that may be occupied by the queue. Doing this will  
provide a visual aid for event operations team, so they know if the system  
is working as planned, and more importantly, they can raise an alert if the  
queue is developing faster than expected. This is important in planning, but  
during operations, it acts as the early warning indicator before it turns into  
an incident or develops into a disaster.  
Queueing  
The ingress system should be designed to minimise queueing, or there  
should be a management consideration for the arriving crowds. A screening  
process, for example, may develop short-term queueing but there should be  
consideration for the size, extent and duration of wait in the queue. Shelter  
from the sun or rain may need to be a factor in the queueing. Duration of  
wait, rate of processing, searching/screening, weather conditions, welfare,  
VIP and mobility-impaired access are factors that should be considered in  
the crowd management plan. Specifically, how many people do you expect  
to be queueing? How long will the crowd be expected to queue \(duration\)?  
How much space will the crowd occupy? Control room applications 203  
If you cannot answer those questions during the event planning phase,  
then you need to engage the services of an expert \(or attend a training  
course\) to maintain safe and efficient crowd management during ingress. If  
you work in a licensing/approval or permitting capacity, you must be able  
to check that the appropriate calculations are present in the document and  
be confident to reject a plan that does not consider the queueing system  
during ingress. If you are working in crowd management, this informa-  
tion should be available so that you can assess if the system is working as  
planned during the event.  
Modelling an ingress system is neither onerous nor costly, but it is an  
essential process for safe crowd management. Inefficient, badly designed,  
poorly maintained or inadequately managed ingress systems, will result in  
excessive queueing. In turn, this will produce crowd frustration and poten-  
tially unpredictable crowd behaviour. Well-designed, well-managed and  
well-informed crowds are generally happier, more compliant and easier to  
manage. Disney has spent many years and invested in understanding crowd  
behaviour and queueing systems and gets it right, first time, every time for  
every new attraction they add to their theme parks.  
Queuing systems require an analysis of the arrival rate and the service  
rate. The arrival rate is the rate at which people will arrive, at the queueing  
system, over a period of time. The service rate is the rate at which people  
can be processes through the queueing system.  
REAL-TIME DECISION SUPPORT TOOL  
We have worked on several major events where a simple chart on the wall  
\(similar to Figure 7.4\) indicates the time crowds are expected. This can be  
very useful to display as a full-colour chart, where the resolution of the  
time \(hourly, half-hourly, etc.\) will depend on the nature and duration of  
the event, the means of arrival \(train, bus, coach, etc.\) and/or potential  
celebrity attendance times.

capacity. 204 Introduction to crowd science

Coupling this information with a site risk map, a graph showing the  
arrival profile \(similar to the chart in Figure 7.5\) provides insights into  
the operational team about the expected crowds at the event. When the  
control room team have a clear idea about crowd arrival, they can monitor  
the situation and then be in a position to act quickly if there are signifi-  
cant changes from the plan. Essentially, first modelling the site, and then  
monitoring the situation as the event develops facilitate good crowd man-  
agement. Without a background model, the risks may pass unnoticed and  
develop into an incident or result in one of those ‘Phew! We were lucky  
that time’ moments.  
Do we really need this?  
There are many events where no site or event model is constructed and the  
maps, plans or diagrams are either not considered or a general site plan,  
overpopulated with information from every agency, is pinned to the wall in  
a control room, and never referred to again. As we previously stated, one of  
the first questions we ask during the workshops is ‘How many people in this  
room have run an event and felt they were lucky to avoid a major incident?’  
Of course, many events run without incident, but the few that do not  
are significant cause for concern. As it takes a few minutes to draw a site  
diagram and annotate it, and this is neither onerous nor highly skilled, we  
recommend that the practice should be universally applied to all events,  
large or small. We suggest the use of tracing sheet, a method we described in  
the previous chapters, and that you colour the areas of concern, highlighting  
risk in red. Practise this method and you will find that it adds to your under-  
standing of the event dynamics and the developing risks. Think about your  
control room and how to display this information so that all the operators  
can see the risks as the event unfolds.  
Consider the site plan as a primary method of communicating through-  
out the event planning and licence/permit application process and simplify Control room applications 205  
the diagrams to include crowd flow and potential congestion. Produce  
many different types of plans of the same area, one for risk, one indicating  
crowd flow, one for normal situations \(ingress, circulation and egress\) and  
one for emergencies. As you produce more diagrams, they will aid your  
own understanding, but more importantly, it will provide the control room  
with information for the operators to process during the event.  
REAL-TIME INFORMATION  
We have been asked, many times, to comment on the use of sophisticated  
technology in the control room, specifically a combination of CCTV  
images and video processing, and automated crowd counting. These are  
expensive systems and beyond the budget of the vast majority of events,  
and the argument that technology can replace key decision making in the  
control room is an interesting but misleading one. As we outlined, the use  
of simulations for crowd control, specifically for event planning, is a white  
elephant.\* The same problems exist with control room and wide-area inte-  
grated technology. Consider the costs of installation, training and support  
for the hardware and software, site/camera calibration and development.  
These are significant costs and at some point, the burden of cost falls on  
the event organiser.  
Is there a low-cost alternative?  
Several costs may need to be considered for the successful deployment of  
a real-time decision support system. By this, we mean some method of  
counting or estimating the crowds and providing useful and timely infor-  
mation to the control room staff. We may need to keep an audit trail of  
the counting information for future planning. If you consider the arrival  
profile, in some cases, there may be larger numbers of people arriving  
shortly before the event starts such as a firework display, or there may be  
events where the crowds arrive hours before the event starts, for example,  
a pop concert.  
We could, using some method, count people entering \(and leaving\) an  
event to ensure that the space does not become overcrowded. We could also  
assess density \(number of people per square metre\) in key locations. Some  
events lend themselves to regulating entry and some have multiple entry/  
exit points and no ticketing. Here are a few low cost techniques that have  
proven to be effective for monitoring crowd flow and density.  
\*  
A white elephant is an idiom for a valuable but burdensome possession of which its owner  
cannot dispose and whose cost \(particularly cost of upkeep\) is out of proportion to its use-  
fulness or worth. 206 Introduction to crowd science  
Wrist bands  
Imagine a hypothetical event that runs all day. In the morning, we may have  
children-based activities; in the afternoon, a family-based performance;  
and in the evening, we are planning a pop concert followed by a fireworks  
display. Our site has 5000 square metres of available space after we have  
set out various stages, stalls, merchandising, a fun fair and our emergency  
services access/egress. Our license condition states that the maximum num-  
ber of people on site, at any given time, should not exceed 10,000 people.  
The event is free and we do not know how many people will attend. The  
problem is to regulate the crowd numbers on the site to ensure the capac-  
ity does not exceed the licence condition \(no more than 10,000 people on  
site at any one time\). We could count people in and out, tally this on some  
computer system and inform the operators that we are approaching the  
limit. That would require two-way information from each gate \(number in  
and number out\) passed to a central control. Someone would need to enter  
this information and then instruct the entry/exit gates about the number of  
people onsite, and how many more people could enter. This is a fairly com-  
plicated situation and, at first glance, it seems to lend itself to some form  
of computerised counting system, perhaps a CCTV counting system that  
would automate the entire process. We can see how the cost of radios, the  
operators, their training and the extent of the crowd control could be offset  
against a computerised system. At first glance, it may appear that automat-  
ing the counting process would reduce errors and ensure safety and the cost  
of an automated counting system would be justified.  
There is a very low-cost solution and it has been used on a number of  
large events very successfully—rubber wrist bands. You buy a box of these,  
better still you canvass the local businesses and ask if anyone would like  
to promote their business on branded wrist bands and have a sponsor pay  
for the box of bands. We have used these ourselves at several events, a local  
business sponsored the event, buying 10,000 branded wrist bands that bore  
their logo and contact number.  
How this works, in practice, is that we start with 10,000 wrist bands  
distributed around the entry points. Everyone who enters the site is given a  
wrist band and asked to hand it in when leaving the site. As long as there  
are wrist bands in the box, the site is below the capacity. If any entry/exit  
point was running short of bands, a runner was sent around the entry/  
exit points to redistribute the remaining wrist bands. This process did not  
require computerisation or accurate counting; handfuls of bands taken  
from one entry/exit point to another were sufficient to maintain stocks.  
This automates the process regulating site capacity, the number of people  
in/out without any technology and, it did not cost the event organisers a  
single penny. The advantage was that when people left at the end of the  
event, they kept the wrist band \(and the advertising\) as a souvenir/keepsake. Control room applications 207  
This has proven to be a cost-effective method for a local business to promote  
their services or a local charity to further their cause. Events are a low mar-  
gin industry, solutions such as sponsored wrist bands, are practical, prag-  
matic and realistic solution to a key issue of maintaining safe site capacity.  
Crowd counting  
There are some free events, such as a city-based fireworks display, where the  
crowds will arrive in numbers that can exceed the display area’s capacity.  
One example of this is the London New Year event. For this event, the pro-  
cess of handing out wrist band would not work, there are too many people  
and, as you will see from the analysis below, they arrive close to the start of  
the event. For this type of crowd arrival profile, we must not introduce any  
element that may delay the crowd entering the site. Such delays could cause a  
crush at the entry points, we need to design a free-flowing system. It is essen-  
tial that, during the site design phase of event planning, you understand  
the crowd arrival profile, to ensure that the infrastructure of the event can  
cope with that arrival profile. Both the Hillsborough and Love Parade events  
experienced ingress crushing and we cannot overemphasise the importance  
of balancing the arrival profile with the ingress/entry capacity.  
MASS TRANSIT SYSTEMS  
The London New Year Event \(LYNE\) site is accessible via London  
Underground, which can deliver tens of thousands of people per hour and  
has a number of viewing areas. Many more people may want to attend  
than the space would safely accommodate. The problem we were asked to  
produce for this event was a method of regulating crowd flow by distribut-  
ing the crowds across several viewing areas. In the last chapter, we outlined  
how closing off Westminster Bridge would regulate the crowd egress; this  
would also assist in distributing the crowds during ingress. Using the prin-  
ciples of design, information and management influences on crowd behav-  
iour, the first task was to analyse the site design, the streets and the routes  
from the stations to the event spaces.  
Figure 7.6 shows part of the site analysis using a network analysis tool  
developed for assessing the ‘station to viewing area’ crowd flows. We can  
perform the same analysis using pen and paper or by using a spreadsheet  
model. This tool was custom designed for testing different arrival profiles,  
the tool allows us to check different levels of crowd flow. By taking the data  
from the London Underground ticket machines, we can derive an initial  
model for the arrival profile. Applying that profile to the routes, we can  
experiment with closing some routes \(Figure 7.7\). 208 Introduction to crowd science

If a system has multiple entry points, then the space will fill more  
quickly than it would with fewer entry points. There needs to be a con-  
sideration among the number of entry points, the approach routes and  
the transportation system capacity. As stated in the last section, we need  
to balance the arrival profile with the event ingress capacity. In this case,  
we use the direct routes to the site as a free-flowing system. The London

the arrival profile for this event. Control room applications 209  
Underground stations exit points and the direct roads from the stations  
to the event viewing areas, were defined as the primary ingress routes; all  
other routes were closed off \(using barriers\) and available for emergency  
access and egress.  
London new year events  
A manual clicker-counter is used on each of the primary routes to count  
one minute of crowd flow every 15 min. This only provides us with an  
approximation of crowd flow, but complete accuracy is not the objective.  
We are estimating when the space is going to be 80% full; this is the condi-  
tion that we will begin a diversion strategy to the other viewing areas. The  
objective is to inform the crowd management team of the rate of fill, and  
whether this is much faster than, slower than or the same as the expected  
flow based on previous years.  
If we know the space is filling faster than the previous years, faster than  
expected, then we need some estimate of when the space will be full. Again,  
we do not need complete accuracy for this time; from 2100, when people  
begin to arrive in mass, the initial input \(Figure 7.8\) indicates that ‘at this  
rate, the space will be full at 2315’.  
From that information, we can begin our diversion strategy at 2200. The  
first step is to inform the people who are about to start on their journey that  
the event may be full when they arrive. Information will influence crowd  
behaviour. The objective of the event is to have the best fireworks display in  
the world, to ensure that the crowds enjoy the event. As such, the event is  
Figure 7.8 Screen image of the fill predictor/flow estimator from the London New Year  
Event. As data is entered, it is both error checked and then projected to provide an  
estimate of the fill time. 210 Introduction to crowd science  
advertised as a free event with the underlying message of ‘everyone can see  
this, up close, for free’. The population that may want to attend the event  
and the capacity of the London Underground exceeds the event space, so  
understanding when the event will be full, a fill predictor is essential to the  
crowd management strategy.  
Things we know  
For all projects, we start with a list of things we know. In this project, we  
knew the event capacity, which is 186,000 people, based on the available  
space. We know the typical arrival profile for fireworks displays, based on  
the experience of similar events around the world, and we know the arrival  
profile for this event, based on the London Underground ticket machine  
data. We can use this information to determine the routes, the required  
capacity of the ingress system and the rate at which the event will fill.  
The arrival profile can be highly variable on the evening of the event due  
to weather, transport problems, alternative events in the area and so on.  
The purpose of the clicker/counting estimations is therefore a check on the  
rate of arrival and not, as such, an accurate counting system.  
The objective is to have controls in place, for each viewing area, when  
it reaches 50% of its capacity and to regulate entry flow, coupled to the  
diversion strategies, at 80% of its capacity. With the ability to anticipate  
when each area is going to be full, we can then issue a wide-area message  
throughout the London Underground network that the ‘event is now full’  
at the appropriate time.  
We issue that message at the time provided by the fill predictor. We have  
a reasonable estimate of the number of people that may be on the under-  
ground system, heading to the event. We also have a good estimate of the  
number of people already inside the event space. We know when the space  
will be full, from the clicker-counter, the rate the crowds are entering the  
event, and we can work back from this information to send our message  
of ‘event full’. This is similar to the advance warning you get for large car  
parks; they may say how many spaces are left, or that the car park is full.  
This prevents queueing and also shapes expectations. This is an important  
behavioural element if people expect to get into an event, they are turned  
away because the event is full, the crowd may react. If, on the other hand,  
you have pre-conditioned the crowd by informing them that the ‘event is  
full’, they will either turn back or if they decide to continue regardless,  
they may be pleasantly surprised to gain entry. This is a psychological  
strategy. We are shaping the crowd’s expectation. Similar strategies are  
used around the world to great effect. It is important that you understand  
the difference between a crowd that expects to get into an event and is then  
denied entry and a crowd that does not expect to get into the event and is  
then allowed entry. Obviously, there is a point during the evening when the Control room applications 211  
decision needs to be made to switch the message to ‘event full’ and that is  
the purpose of the sample counting system described above.  
When asked about integrating accurate counting technology to major  
events, we always look to the quality of the information, what we can do  
with that information and how accurate we need the data to be to achieve  
the objective. Examples such as rubber wrist band, clicker counting, and  
the like demonstrate that low-cost solutions can and do work for major  
events. The emphasis is not on the technology but on the crowd safety  
requirements, the command and control structure, and the actions required  
for timely intervention. If you are going to invest in CCTV, video processing  
and crowd counting technology, first consider the importance of the data,  
how you are going to act on that data and if the investment improves upon  
low-cost alternatives. Remember the sales representative may be motivated  
more by his bonus than the improvement his/her system offers for crowd  
safety and that technology, by itself, does not manage the crowd. It is,  
at best, information to assist the crowd manager. A badly designed event  
ingress system, one where the arrival profile exceeds the ingress capacity,  
will not suddenly begin to operate more safely by accurately counting the  
crowds. CCTV counting technology will not make such a system safe.  
ESTIMATING DENSITY  
There are events that do not lend themselves to counting methods because  
there are too many potential points of entry. For those, we still need some  
method of regulating crowd flow, or a diversion strategy. One example of  
this is the Royal Wedding \(2011\) in London. For this type of project we  
start with estimating the number of people who can safely attend the event.  
This comes from an area analysis where Internet mapping tools, survey  
maps, event plans or site surveys inform us of the available viewing areas.  
We know the length of the route, and the attendance from previous events  
\(video footage\). From this information, we can estimate the crowd sizes  
in key locations, for example, along the Mall, around the Queen Victoria  
Memorial and so on.  
We cannot barrier off the entire site and control access to those areas, but  
we can evaluate the crowd requirements and design an attractive alterna-  
tive. In this case, the site capacity was large, but there was a probability that  
the crowds would exceed the safe capacity. In this case, we considered large  
screens in Hyde Park, which had a capacity of several hundred thousand.  
Diversion strategy  
The strategy was to divert the crowd to larger areas at Hyde Park, and  
the solution was information based. The crowd would not want to go to 212 Introduction to crowd science  
the Hyde Park area; they would want to go to the Mall, the areas close to  
Buckingham Palace.  
When the key locations such as the Mall, Queen Victoria Memorial,  
and the areas close to Buckingham Palace were 80% of their capacity,  
we need to divert any further crowds to the alternative site. We cannot  
count the arriving crowds, as there are many possible underground sta-  
tions, bus routes, local population, business and car parks around the  
key locations. The first consideration was Green Park station, the station  
closest to the site, and we advised this station is closed for the event.\*  
There was not enough space to manage the crowds between Green Park  
station and the event site. We need the crowds to approach the key  
locations in such a way that we can reroute the approaching crowds to  
the larger site \(Hyde Park\) when the primary site \(Buckingham Palace  
areas\) were full. For that we could use information to influence crowd  
behaviour.  
Uniformity of signage  
The subtlety we used was to uniformly sign the event as ‘The Royal  
Wedding Event’ on VMS \(variable message signs\) from the Underground  
stations and along key routes to the site. This allowed us to switch the  
direction without changing the description. Consider the crowd reaction if  
we had switched the information from ‘Buckingham Palace’ to ‘Hyde Park’.  
The crowd would want to go to “Buckingham Palace” not “Hyde Park” but  
by using the words “Royal Wedding Event” we could reroute before key  
locations exceeded the safe crowd capacity.  
We mapped out the primary routes from all the stations to the most  
desirable viewing areas \(around Buckingham Palace\). This meant we could  
divert the crowds when required. The question in the control room was  
when should the messaging/information system reroute the crowds.  
Since we could not sample count in the way we designed for the London  
New Year event, we needed another method of estimating the crowd num-  
bers. For that we produced a series of graphic images, a set for each CCTV  
camera and helicopter, which gave the control room a visual guide for 80%  
full. At that time, we switch the signs to divert the crowd to Hyde Park.  
Figures 7.9 through 7.11 show a few sample screens produced for the con-  
trol room for this event.  
We need to stress that this process may be replicated using a wide  
range of tools, but you need to ensure that the crowd packing is not grid  
based, in other words, the way crowds fill space is not the same a chess  
board, where each character occupies their own square. Crowds have a

We seem to make a habit of shutting down London Underground Stations for events. Control room applications 213

characteristic distribution \(spaces between individuals\) and visuals, to  
be realistic, need to emulate the spaces between people. We produced  
a system that has a sophisticated algorithm \(numerical recipe\) to mimic  
the packing of real crowds; it is not a simulation and it only illustrates  
the crowd density to assist the control room in understanding the density  
limits. When you couple this with a crowd management strategy, you can  
populate any given map, plan, diagram, satellite image, with a realistic  
looking crowd. This achieves the objective, estimating the crowd density  
and hence site/area capacity, at low cost.  
The reason we needed to produce this, and to show crowds from differ-  
ent angles, similar to the angles you would observe from the control room,  
is best demonstrated using the following series of images. Try to estimate  
the crowd density in each of these diagrams.  
Each of these images indicates the same crowd density shown from dif-  
ferent angles. Most people are surprised at this, thinking that the crowd  
density looks much higher in some images than in others. This is, of course,  
why we chose this set of images and why we developed the density estima-  
tor. We would produce a series of graphics, matching the CCTV angles,  
and print these off as a quick reference for control room operators. Again,  
this is low-cost technology and the control room only needs to flip the book  
of images to the one that looks closest to their image on the CCTV screen  
to be able to estimate density.  
The crowd management strategy for rerouteing the crowds to Hyde Park  
was based on graphic references. When the CCTV image looks like the  
graphic, switch the sign’s direction arrow from Buckingham Palace to Hyde  
Park. We do this at 80% of the event capacity, to allow for those individuals  
who are in transit, between the signs and the viewing areas. If we wait until  
we are at 100% of the event capacity, the site will overfill with the people  
in transit. We need some buffer, so we act early, but not too early, with the  
diversion strategy. If we have underestimated the crowd density, we can  
always allow more to enter later. It is far more difficult to turn people away  
once they are committed to a course of action.  
In effect, this is a sleight of mind technique; the subtle change of direction  
must be coupled to a suitable reward at the destination. The large screens  
provide the crowd with a great view of the event. The Hyde Park site has  
more space, attractions, picnic areas, merchandising, food and beverage, toi-  
lets and so on. The crowd enjoyed the event and all had a great time.  
Behind the scenes of this event, and all major events, there is a contin-  
gency plan for emergencies. We have already outlined that an emergency  
can occur during ingress, mid-event \(circulation\) and during egress, where  
crowd movements present different management challenges and where  
design, information and management can influence behaviour. We need to  
expand on these fundamental concepts in the context of the control crowd  
risk analysis for emergencies. Control room applications 215  
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT  
The topic of emergency management is a subject of many other books and  
we would recommend that anyone intent on a career in event or crowd  
management should attend courses on emergency management and contin-  
gency planning. We focus most of our work on the prevention of incidents  
through good design, information and management principles and applica-  
tions; prevention is always the preferred option.  
It is worth considering the disaster recovery cycle in the context of crowd  
science as that provides a perspective to secondary problems that can arise  
during an incident, specifically crowd build-up during ingress and egress.  
When dealing with an incident, one that may be minor \(such as a problem  
with one of the entry gates\) or non-life-threatening, the crowd build-up can  
develop into a situation that is life-threatening. For example, the Love Parade  
\(Duisburg 2010\) disaster developed from a late start \(one hour later than  
planned\). While the site was being prepared, entry was delayed and the crowd  
density built up outside the entry point. When the ramp began to fail and the  
crowd congestion on the ramp reached critical levels, the crowd congestion on  
the entry system was beyond its design capacity, and was difficult to manage.  
Entry points failed, the ramp failed and the crowd flowed into the system.  
Disaster recovery cycle  
We need to outline the essential principles of a crowd disaster, such as Love  
Parade and Hillsborough \(and many others\) to highlight the control room  
function and consequential crowd risks. The diagram in Figure 7.12 shows  
a typical disaster recovery cycle. At the centre of this diagram is the legend  
‘crowd congestion builds up from the incident to recovery’. Meaning, the  
crowd may be unaware of a problem in the system and continue moving  
towards an incident location.  
To highlight this important aspect of incident management, we will out-  
line the various elements of the disaster recovery cycle—from incident to  
recovery.  
Operational  
The site is functioning during the operational phase. At some point, an inci-  
dent is detected and the control room shifts into an ‘incident’ or ‘major inci-  
dent’ phase. The event staff would typically manage minor incidents. Major  
incidents \(emergency situations\) would normally be under the control of the  
emergency team \(police or fire services\). What is important to note is that  
when a major incident is declared, the primacy \(the control\) will shift to the  
emergency team. This normally indicates that the event plan has failed. As  
we stressed in previous chapters, the primary duty of care, to provide a safe 216 Introduction to crowd science  
Figure 7.12  The disaster recovery cycle. During a major event, the crowd congestion  
can build up while the incident is in progress. It is essential to consider the  
consequences of blocking an entry/exit for a crowd in motion.  
environment, is the responsibility of the event organiser. During an inci-  
dent consequential action should not introduce further risks to the crowd.  
Crowd congestion can build up, at various points around the system, dur-  
ing the incident. This was the cycle at the Love Parade \(Duisburg 2010\)  
where crowd congestion continued to build up at the entry points during  
the initial delay, and again when the police actions began.  
Incident  
If an incident occurs at an event, it is essential, to understand the cause  
of the incident and the potential impact of emergency actions. Desktop  
exercises, coupled to modelling, site analysis \(RAMP and DIM-ICE\), and  
training will help assess this potential impact during the planning phase.  
However, emergency response teams and, specifically, incident command-  
ers need to understand the plan. A review of major incidents illustrates a  
significant disconnect between the critical functions of the control room,  
crowd management and incident management systems during incidents.  
For example, communication systems that are restricted to a single agency,  
e.g., event radio systems, police radio systems, ambulance and fire radio  
systems, may not be compatible. This can mean that operational and inci-  
dent management teams are unable to communicate.  
Anyone at the event, members of the public, marshals, staff, security,  
police and others may raise the alert that an incident has occurred. How  
this information is processed and passed onto the control room will be Control room applications 217  
critical in determining the scale of the required response to the incident.  
Early response is essential to minimise the potential impact of a problem,  
to prevent the problem from escalating.  
Detection  
Early detection of an incident coupled to an incident management plan  
can reduce the potential for escalation to a major incident. If there is a  
potential for crowd congestion to build up due to the incident the event  
may need an emergency crowd management plan. Detection may be via  
spotters, individuals who are tasked with monitoring the crowd either  
at the ground level or from a raised platform or tower. CCTV opera-  
tors should understand crowd movement and be trained to evaluate the  
crowd flow, crowd density and the overall system dynamics. Clearly,  
understanding the site, the ingress, circulation and egress phases of an  
event, the normal and emergency crowd movements, will assist in con-  
tingency planning. Modelling and training for individuals who may be  
tasked with crowd monitoring will make those individuals more effective  
in this task.  
Control  
Primacy, the overall responsibility for managing an incident, will typi-  
cally pass to the emergency services, for example, the police or fire com-  
mander. It is essential that these individuals also understand the impact  
of the overall site dynamics. If an incident occurs in one area, it may  
have an impact on other areas of the event. For example, an incident  
at an entry point may require a diversion strategy for further incoming  
crowds. Obviously, the larger the event crowd, the more this consider-  
ation becomes important.  
Over the years, we have read and commented on many hundreds of event  
plans. One common comment during an incident is—who has primacy? If  
primacy is passed to a commander who has no overall understanding of  
crowd dynamics, decisions could be made that create further problems. If  
we consider a Hillsborough scenario, a crush develops at a set of turnstiles;  
to alleviate the pressure, an exit gate is opened and crowds flood into an  
area of the event. Understanding site capacity, flow rates, crowd density  
and crowd flow are essential skills to make such a decision, to ensure that  
the consequences of one action do not create a problem elsewhere.  
Recovery  
The recovery phase relates to emergency management and the first respond-  
ers and emergency services are trained to handle a wide range of incidents. 218 Introduction to crowd science  
Managing crowds that can either assist or get in the way needs to be factored  
into the planning for major incidents. Coordination between ­ marshals/  
stewards, the event team and the emergency services should all be a consid-  
eration in the event and crowd management plan. To illustrate this specific  
point, we recently planned and managed an event, a parade though a Lake  
District town. The operational orders for marshals were specific; clear the  
crowds from any area of an incident and to provide the necessary space for  
the emergency services to perform their duties. The police will take control  
of the area and you should follow their instructions.  
PREVENTION  
The best form of incident management is to prevent an incident occurring in  
the first place. There is an apt saying, ‘plan for worst, hope for the best’, which  
epitomises the concept of crowd safety. If we categorise the types of incident  
and look to means of prevention, there are a few headlines to consider.  
Engineering  
Can we engineer the site to minimise the risk of crowd-related incidents?  
For example, configuring barrier systems to maintain a balanced ingress/  
egress flow, site design and facilities planning/management may minimise  
the risk of potential crowd problems. We use the phrase ‘safe fail’ and  
highlight the difference between ‘safe fail’ and ‘fail safe’ approaches to  
site design. Assume the system will fail, and then evaluate how the system  
may fail. Evaluate how the system may fail in relative safety. To illustrate  
this point, consider both a Hillsborough and Love Parade type of event. If  
pressure builds up on the entry system, how do we alleviate the pressure?  
Had the Hillsborough or the Love Parade planners, licensing \(or approval\)  
authorities or police commanders understood the overall site dynamics,  
those incidents may not have developed into mass fatalities. Engineering  
solutions typically have rigorous quality assurance for safety-critical sys-  
tems; we should look to those practices and apply similar engineering stan-  
dards to the events industry. Understanding how crowd density can build  
up at events, during incidents and during evacuation, is essential for engi-  
neering safer spaces.  
Crowd management  
Good crowd management will reduce the risk of crowd-related incidents  
and the principles and applications of the various models demonstrated  
in the previous chapters should provide the reader with a framework for  
improving crowd safety at their own events. If you review major crowd Control room applications 219  
incidents relating to mass fatalities, you will note that crowd management,  
during the incident is a critical function. The focus is typically on the site  
of the incident and not on the rest of the crowd. Secondary points of failure  
are a factor in both Hillsborough and Love Parade disasters.  
Information systems  
We touched on the subject of communication incompatibility in the previ-  
ous section of this chapter. It will be too late to discover that you have this  
kind of problem during an incident and it may lead to additional compli-  
cations/problems or needlessly escalate an incident. A review of past inci-  
dents has highlighted that poor interagency communication systems have  
exasperated the situation. One example of this is the phenomena called  
‘radio black spots’, areas where radio systems have difficulty reaching. A  
recent city-wide event we were working with had such a ‘black spot’ and  
we required an ambulance to access the area of this ‘black spot’ for a resi-  
dent. The incident was not connected with the event \(a parade though the  
town\), but we had to stop the parade to facilitate access for the ambulance.  
Although we had set up event communications and checked the area before  
the event, the assumption on the part of the ambulance service, was that if  
our radios would work in this area and then the ambulance radios would  
also work was flawed. We checked our equipment prior to and on the eve-  
ning of the event. The first responders and ambulance service had their  
own radio communications system and they had not checked if their system  
worked, they had assumed that if our radios were operational, their own  
radios would function. Sometimes, new buildings, local weather condi-  
tions, terrain and other radio frequencies can all impact radio communica-  
tions. Our contingency plan had considered radio failure and the situation  
was managed without further issue. The parade was interrupted but con-  
tinued successfully.  
If things are going to go wrong, they may go wrong at the worst pos-  
sible time in the worst possible location. During an incident is the worst  
time to discover communication problems, so invest the time to check the  
site, specifically if your event is in a built-up area such as a town or city  
centre.  
Integrated management  
Individuals in the control room may have different degrees of experience,  
training and operational understanding of events and specifically knowl-  
edge or experience of the current event. As a result, they may all be work-  
ing under a wide range of assumptions and/or event understanding. It is  
not uncommon for a team to meet for the first time in a control room  
at the start of an event. Comprehensive mapping of both crowd flow and 220 Introduction to crowd science  
potential congestion/risk, assists in the understanding of those risks to the  
crowd during events.  
Information theory, the principles defined by Shannon in 1948, out-  
lined that any information needs to be coded into a form such that, at  
some point in the future, it can be decoded without loss of information.  
The event plan and risk assessment process do not convey safety-critical  
information in a quick and easy-to-understand format. The issue we set  
out to address is the understanding of the overall site dynamics, with a  
specific focus on the crowd movement normal and emergency situations.  
A diagram of crowd movement, normal and emergency, conveys a lot of  
information at a glance. Our experience is this format allows a team to  
understand a site quickly and easily. We always recommend to walk the  
site on the day of the event, and to take a set of site diagrams with you, one  
that has the risks mapped and the other with the crowd movement/flow  
mapped to the relevant areas of the site. Those visuals assist the manage-  
ment during emergency situations where every second is vital for decision  
making during an incident.  
In the control room, specifically during an incident, it is vital that every-  
one has the same perceptions. There is no time to read or review an event  
plan; obviously site plans, flow diagrams and risk maps, assist understand-  
ing of the situation. During an incident, the control room team will be  
making safety-critical decisions and it is important that they are using a  
similar approach to crowd safety. We have worked in control rooms over a  
wide range of events, most develop an integrated approach to incident man-  
agement, and understand the concept of an integrated management team.  
Many events, specifically the larger events operating on lower budgets, may  
not adopt, or even understand, the concept of an integrated incident man-  
agement team. This can be a major weakness during an incident observed  
in several major incident investigations. Event or site managers that are  
unfamiliar with their site cannot be effective during an incident.  
Video analysis  
We recommend that every CCTV operator has some basic modelling expe-  
rience. This, coupled with their skills at monitoring a crowd, helps both  
the interpretation of the situation and the possible consequences of criti-  
cal decisions relating to crowd movements. There are several systems that  
attempt to automatically detect incidents that we discussed earlier in this  
chapter. We are yet to see a technology that is both cost effective and has  
practical applications for assessing crowd risks in real time. The events  
industry is low cost, low margin, so solutions need to consider the end  
users. A few hours of training can provide a significant improvement in site  
understanding, and produce control room diagrams that assist the team’s  
appreciation of the situation. There may come a time where technology Control room applications 221  
becomes cost effective, but this does not appear to be soon. There are, of  
course, some events, such as in Olympic events and other such major sport-  
ing fixtures, where crowd counting technology can be an asset. Turnstile  
counters provide useful real-time information about the venue loading and  
potential last-minute walk up.  
We have reviewed a number of ‘so-called’ automated wide-area crowd  
counters and in every case to date, these have high error rates at high den-  
sity and are of dubious reliability. Overall, these types of systems are costly  
and need to be coupled to a wide-area site model so that the data can  
be converted into useful information. The basic problem at low-cost, low-  
margin events, those that have the highest risk, is that these events simply  
do not have the budget for such equipment or the fundamental understand-  
ing of the problems of crowd management. For example, if they perceived  
a problem at the Love Parade, would they invest in monitoring equipment  
or changed the design? A design change would cost less, and be safer, than  
monitoring a dangerous situation poised for failure. Consider the invest-  
ment for Jamarat Bridge CCTV monitoring and systems automation for  
2006, where 363 lives were lost. Previous years relied on management  
training, integrated team understanding and seven different safety systems  
in place. This infrastructure was replaced with an automated system, large  
signs, CCTV and crowd counting were installed. 363 Pilgrims perished,  
the results speak for themselves. Technology can help, but only for a few  
large events, with appropriate integration to a working crowd management  
team. It does not, as such, replace crowd management, and cannot, no mat-  
ter how much investment is made, replace all the control room functions.  
There is still a need to manage the crowd irrespective of the technology  
investment, and still a need to plan and check the event plan and crowd  
risks. These functions do not lend themselves to computerised solutions,  
someone needs to check the plan and the efficacy of the crowd management  
team. Assuming the application of a computer system will replace critical  
functions shows a lack of understanding of the problem and the opera-  
tional functions of crowd management.  
We have, over many years, reviewed many different types of control room  
and event teams, assessed the problems and cost–benefit analysis, reviewed  
emergency response situations, near misses, guidance and legislative require-  
ments. Mega-events, such as the Olympics, invest in technology and wide-  
area modelling, in safety systems and training, but the vast majority of events  
do not understand the principles and applications of crowd risk analysis,  
crowd dynamics, crowd modelling and carry on ignorant of the potential  
risks. Those events, the vast majority, are the events that we are trying to  
improve through crowd and event modelling.  
During an incident, one of the critical factors is the consideration for which  
spaces may be available for the evacuation process and the requirement for  
accessibility \(routes and spaces to set-up/function\) for the first responders. 222 Introduction to crowd science  
Getting people out and away  
There are no ‘absolutes’ in safety engineering for crowds. The only place  
that is absolutely safe is an empty area, where there is no one whatsoever  
and where no one can get injured. As soon as people enter a venue, there are  
associated risks, and risk management becomes an operational function.  
This is why the brief description and a simple number in risk assessment  
can be misleading. The risk can be a function of the number of people, their  
packing configuration, the site design and the event as it unfolds. Crowd  
risks are dynamic in nature and the conventional risk assessment process  
fails to capture that type of risk. This can be critical during an emergency  
when a choice between several options, which may all carry different risks,  
need to be considered. Assessing which is the best option, specifically if the  
decision is time critical, requires a competent understanding of the situa-  
tion and potential consequences. We described several modelling systems  
that can assist in this decision-making process, but they are only useful if  
the decision maker has those fundamental modelling skills and invested  
some time in the process.  
Love Parade \(2010\), Hillsborough \(1989\) and Jamarat Bridge \(2001,  
2004, 2006\) are three sites where simple modelling would have led to a  
clearer understanding of the causality, the underlying dynamic risks in the  
environment. The incidents in these three sites were mass fatalities during  
ingress, stressing the need to define emergency plans for all three phases of  
the event \(ingress, circulation and egress\). During ingress, where the crowd  
is moving through the entry system, there will be a potential requirement  
for emergency vehicle access. Love Parade had no provision for emergency  
access in the critical area, during an incident. Trying to move an emergency  
vehicle through a crowd is dangerous, specifically if the crowd is packed at  
high density. Space, areas where we can move vehicles into an emergency  
situation and move the crowds away from the incident, needs to be planned  
into the site and event design. The process of emergency egress and site  
evacuation is not just about getting people out of the incident area but also  
about getting them away from the incident safely and efficiently.  
We define egress as moving people \(and in some situations, animals\)  
from a place of relative danger to a place of relative safety. Again, it should  
be stressed that there are no absolutes, specifically during an incident.  
Emergency egress is not just a process of pushing people out of a building;  
emergency evacuation needs to consider the routes and final destination  
of the crowd. You must think further than the exit of your event or build-  
ing and this can involve assessing the risks during the evacuation process.  
For example, during one workshop, we reviewed the plans for the evacua-  
tion of a major London football stadium. It would take 18 minutes to clear  
the stands of the stadium and immediate area around the site. However,  
this assumes that the entire route width was available. We highlighted Control room applications 223  
that, during an emergency, there may be people clustering, trying to stay  
together as groups, that first responders may require access along those  
same routes, that vehicles \(fire engines/trucks, ambulances\) may be com-  
ing in the same routes the crowds are trying to get out. When planning an  
emergency response, you have to think about this overlap of time, when the  
crowds leave and the first responders arrive, and that can have a significant  
impact on the rates of egress. We highlight, time and again, that egress  
calculations are based on assumptions of clear routes. You should consider  
the contingency plan for a percentage of each route being blocked. It may  
be dependent on the location and nature of the incident.  
To assist you in this process, consider the following questions\: What  
are your assumptions in calculating safety egress? Will the crowd respond  
immediately to the incident? How are they alerted to the nature of the inci-  
dent? Will the crowd leave by the nearest exit unassisted or do you need to  
facilitate that process? Are all routes clear? What is the contingency plan  
if there is a suspicious package on one of the exit routes? When the crowd  
leaves the area of the immediate threat, will they leave the area or stand  
and watch events unfold?  
PARADOX OF CHOICE  
We run an experiment in the workshops that highlights a problem of deci-  
sion making during egress. Specifically, how an individuals choice of route  
is based on a phenomena known as Ellsberg’s paradox.\* We select a dele-  
gate and ask if they would like to play a game for a sum of money, typically  
£10,000 \(or the equivalent sum in local currency\). We state that we will  
give the delegate the money if he/she selects a red ball, but they must give  
us the money if they pick a black ball. We then ask the delegate to imagine  
two buckets. Bucket number 1 has 500 red balls and 500 black balls. These  
are thoroughly mixed and the delegate cannot see into the bucket. We ask  
them to imagine a second bucket, bucket number 2, which has an unknown  
mix of red and black balls. Bucket number 2 has the same number of balls  
as bucket number 1 but the balls could be all red or all black. We stress that  
anything is possible, 50–50, 70–30, 90–10 and that we do not know the  
mix in the bucket. There are no additional clues to the game; they have to  
choose a bucket. This experiment demonstrates the perception of risk, the  
paradox of choice.  
Which bucket would you choose?  
50–50 or the unknown mix?  
\*  
http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg\_paradox. 224 Introduction to crowd science  
We have run this experiment for many years and 80% of the group will  
choose the 50–50 bucket, bucket 1. To ensure you have a balanced view,  
whatever the delegate chooses \(they are under a little bit of pressure\), ask  
the entire audience to put up their hand for bucket 1. You will see around  
80% will choose bucket 1.  
Mathematically, the probability of getting a red ball in either bucket is  
exactly the same. This experiment is not based on mathematical ability  
\(and we have run this experiment with a group of mathematicians with  
exactly the same results\). This experiment is phrased to illustrate our per-  
ceptions of risk. You base your choice on the information provided, about  
those things you think you know about the system. In this situation, we do  
not use mathematical or our analytical, higher brain functions; we go on  
gut feel and instinct. We make our decisions on what we think we know,  
we weigh risk; we do not measure it.  
Why is this important?  
Imagine you are in an unfamiliar building, or an event and the evacuation  
alarm sounds. You feel like you have to leave the area, and you have to get  
out quickly. You look around and you see the way you came in; you remem-  
ber that route. You know that route! You know how long it took to get in ...  
and there is option number 2, a door/exit-marked emergency exit. However,  
you do not know where it goes, you do not know if it is open and you do not  
know what is on the other side of the door! This is the paradox of choice,  
Ellsberg’s paradox, you will choose the route that you think has lesser risk.  
In this case, it is not a sum of money at stake, it is your life.  
The vast majority of fire-related deaths record people crowding round the  
primary entry point; in many cases, there were sufficient and viable exits,  
but during the first few moments of an incident, each individual has to make  
a decision. Which route to take? Two things happen\: first, there is the para-  
dox of choice, and second, is the evaluation of how others react. ‘If they are  
going that way, I should go that way too’—a flocking/following behaviour.  
This is the same type of decision process\: you may think the rest of the  
group may have the information that you do not have, and follow those  
people who appear to be leaving the area. This is one of the primary reasons  
why the majority of people will go out the way they came in.  
This has nothing to do with panic. It is related to the early moments of  
the incident, with how we perceive and act upon those perceptions of risk;  
we call this behavioural-based safety. An event \(and building evacuations\)  
will often be planned on the assumption of sufficient emergency egress  
capacity \(exit routes and width of exits\) to get people out in any direction,  
that all \(or most\) routes will be available and utilised, and that the people  
know what they are doing. There are many books and symposiums on  
fires and human behaviour \(a list of references can be found http\://www. Control room applications 225  
gkstill.com/Support/index.html\) and we recommend that anyone involved  
in emergency planning should familiarise themselves with the concepts of  
behavioural based safety and bystander behaviour. The topic of human  
behaviour, during emergency situations is beyond the scope of this book,  
but we will conclude this short overview with a strategic analysis of crowd  
movements for different types of threats.  
Strategic analysis  
What would happen if you have a security alert at your main exit, a sus-  
picious package, and you have a reason to believe there is a need to clear  
the event/building/site/area? The location of the package is on the primary  
ingress route, and the crowd may move towards the threat, unless instructed  
otherwise. How do you get the crowd to leave by alternative exits? How do  
you get that information to the crowd? How do you get them to respond  
quickly? They may try to exit the way they came in.  
If your staff are trained in emergency procedures and understand the  
paradox of choice, they can manage the process, open alternative exits,  
and guide people towards those exits. Information and management are  
the tools you will need to facilitate the process. Each environment may  
require different considerations and there could be a vast range of potential  
threats to consider. The problem appears to be intractable \(too complex\)  
and trying to document all possible options is a very difficult, complex  
and time-consuming process. A book of words outlining all the possible  
options would also be intractable; it may not be a useful reference during  
an emergency, since it contains too much information to be memorised, or  
referenced quickly during an emergency.  
FOUR SOLUTIONS  
When we first reviewed this specific problem, rather than tackle the problem  
of listing all the possible threats and all the possible exit route choices and  
issues with each threat and each response, we looked at the problem from  
the crowd perspective. There were four possible outcomes to any threat  
scenario that required the movement of people. If we break these down  
into actions, rather than incident-related responses, the problem becomes  
much simpler for the control room decision-making process. Each of these  
requires site-specific training, but the list of options becomes manageable.  
Total  
Typically, the fire-type scenario where we need to facilitate a rapid evacu-  
ation and all possible routes are available. Non-directional alarms can be 226 Introduction to crowd science  
used, exit points can be manned and staff, positioned at the exits, can guide  
people away from the area. This provides the crowd with vital information.  
‘This way’ instructions delivered by a member of the staff/police/steward/  
security will change the paradox of choice away from their point of entry  
towards that specific exit. It removes the uncertainty and this process and  
this procedure is used at all UK football stadia. Gates are manned and  
they are opened in an emergency, and stewards guide patrons towards that  
specific exit.  
Directed  
If a threat exists on a primary ingress route, you need to consider the direc-  
tion of egress. An alarm sounding across the entire site will not inform the  
crowd of the location of the threat, or the direction away from the threat.  
You will need to consider how to alert the crowd and how to move them in  
a specific direction away from the threat.  
Phased/partial  
There may be a requirement, such as a stadium or tall building, where  
the area of immediate threat needs to be evacuated, but other areas are  
relatively safe and there is no immediate threat to the people in those  
areas. Again, this process needs to start with the alarm signalling. How  
are you going to inform the crowd of specific directions for the evacuation  
process?  
Stay put  
In many cases, it can be a safer option to keep the crowd on-site, to decant  
the crowd away from a threat, but not to evacuate the area. An example of  
this may be a fireworks display in a large park. The site capacity may be  
vast and the crowds may be focussed only in one small area of the park.  
Moving the crowds away from a threat, to a safer location within the site,  
can be a safer option than site-wide evacuation. An external threat, such  
as a suspicious package outside the venue/event/space, may require moving  
the crowd on-site, away from the threat, but it does not necessarily require  
a total site evacuation.  
Each site should consider the above, total, directed, phased/partial or  
stay-put strategies for emergency situations. When we review major events,  
we are often reviewing these evacuation processes, specifically the alarm  
signals and initial crowd reactions. As we stated previously, there are a  
number of books, courses, symposia and conferences on fires and human  
behaviour. The final point to note on this topic is the use of simulations for  
evacuation assessment. Most have two fundamental flaws. Control room applications 227  
PROBLEMS WITH EVACUATION SIMULATIONS  
Apart from the previously mentioned packing density problems relating to  
simulating crowd movement, the assumptions on human behaviour in many  
simulations are questionable. For example, whenever we see an evacuation  
model where the agents \(the computer-generated people\) move immediately  
towards all possible exits and the system provides an evacuation time, we  
highlight the paradox of choice.  
We also stress that there will be a period of decision making, the time  
to make up the individual’s mind, to begin the process of evacuation. The  
late Dr. Jonathan Sime highlighted this problem \(There is a list of reference  
materials on the website http\://www.gkstill.com/Support/index.html\) and  
we recommend that you read, study and understand this type of problem.  
Typically, two-thirds of the total evacuation process is getting people to  
start to move.  
If the simulation does not show this time to start to move, it will be mis-  
leading. If the simulation shows all exits being used evenly and people mov-  
ing towards their nearest exit, it will be misleading. If the simulation does  
not evaluate human factors, it will be misleading. Caveat emptor \(buyer  
beware\). Chapter 8

INTRODUCTION  
One of the primary motives for developing this approach to crowd risk analy-  
sis and event safety applications is to improve both the awareness and under-  
standing of crowd related accidents and incidents. The objective is to reduce  
the potential for crowd injury in places of public assembly. We need to achieve  
this at low cost, using minimum skills, to be effective, and to have an impact  
on crowd safety around the world. We have defined tools and methods, not  
from an academic perspective, but from a practical, real-world set of experi-  
ences and applications for event planning. These techniques apply to all events.  
There is a clear imperative to this work, which comes from talking to  
thousands of delegates over two decades. The process of compiling an event  
plan, risk assessment and specifically the licensing application is onerous  
and time consuming; therefore, shortcuts, specifically ‘cut and paste’ are the  
normal practice. Having reviewed many hundreds of event plans and risk  
assessments \(some were excellent but most were substandard\), it is obvi-  
ous which plans are of the ‘dust off last year’s plan, slap a new date on the  
front, that will do’ category. Successful events grow larger, free events such  
as Christmas tree lights switch-on events often employ pop stars, attracting  
large audiences, and subsequently increase the risk of congestion and over-  
crowding. These are the events where last year’s plan may no longer work,  
specifically if the crowd grows larger every year.  
Monitoring the crowd arriving at the event is essential to keep ahead of  
the crowd problems. If your event falls into the ‘free’ or ‘charity’ category, it  
229 230 Introduction to crowd science  
does not absolve you of your fundamental duty of care, to protect the crowd  
from harm.  
INCREASED AWARENESS  
To achieve our goal of improving awareness of crowd risks, we must con-  
solidate the best practices and improve the fundamental understanding of  
crowd risk assessment and accident prevention. The DIM-ICE Meta model  
is a method of capturing both the structure and highlighting the nature of  
risks at the event, specifically if you colour the template red/orange or green  
for each of the 18 sections.  
The quality of the information needs to be continually improved through-  
out the planning, approval and operational phases of the event process to  
be effective, regardless of the event size or complexity. DIM-ICE Meta  
modelling captures both information \(for future event planning\) and allows  
the dissemination of information in a standard format, collecting and col-  
lating best practises and incidents of near misses. The objective for this is  
both information sharing and to assess risk in a more graphical format,  
highlighting the specific combination of phases and influences on crowd  
behaviour in the DIM-ICE meta model, the flow diagrams and risk map-  
ping in the crowd management plan.  
ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY  
The event organiser has the ultimate responsibility for crowd safety at their  
event. In Appendix B, you will see a summary of international incidents  
and accidents, this will give you some idea of the scale of the problem  
around the world. The responsibility is the same, no matter the scale of the  
event, whether it requires approval, a license or a permit. The event organ-  
iser should create an event plan and this plan needs to identify the risks  
associated with their event. This plan should be checked and externally  
approved, by a group or individual with experience in crowd risk assess-  
ment and safety engineering both from a legislative requirement \(Health  
and Safety at Work Act in the United Kingdom\) and from a fundamental  
duty of care to the people attending the event.  
Therein lies the basic problem with the system; there are no standards for  
event planning or the approval process and there are no designated quali-  
fications for either planning or licensing. We ran a series of workshops for  
event-licensing officers across the United Kingdom and can confirm very  
few \(if any\) had considered the principles outlined in this chapter before  
the workshop. Following a 2-day course, we have now made the majority  
of event-licensing officers in the United Kingdom aware of the DIM-ICE The way forward 231  
Meta modelling, the issues of crowd density and the dynamics of risk. We  
are also creating an online version of these basic courses on an eLearning  
platform, coupled to forums where we can develop these principles and  
applications further.  
Event planners can begin to incorporate the safety concepts into their  
event and crowd management plan, a licensing/permitting officer, use  
the DIM-ICE Meta model as a checklist. Some key questions that can be  
addressed are\: Does the plan have the consideration for an emergency dur-  
ing ingress, during circulation and also during egress and does the plan  
provides a reasonable basis for rejecting event plans that fail to consider  
such situations? This level of awareness needs to be global. Our aim is to  
provide on-line teaching and training materials to help improved world-  
wide awareness of the crowd risks in places of public assembly.

the time, location and severity of the risk. The purpose of this is to move  
towards the concepts defined by Shannon information theory, in that the  
plan should facilitate anyone, from the layperson to an expert alike, with  
relevant information.  
We have found diagrams are far more descriptive than lengthy words and  
would suggest a further enhancement. The standard text of an event plan  
splits into two sections\: the legal/contractual elements, defining the duties  
and obligations of the contracting arrangements and the event description.  
By dividing the event plan into these two sections, you will find that the  
legal sections lend themselves to words, which will be very similar from  
event to event, while the event, and crowd management plans lend them-  
selves to diagrams, which will be unique to each event. Normal Ingress Circulation Egress

A ‘pinch point’ is an area where the crowd congestion builds up due to the geometry of the site, where more people approach a point \(the pinch point\)  
than can pass through that part of the system.  
232 Introduction to crowd science﻿ The way forward 233  
With emphasis on the description of the crowd movements in diagrams, the  
approval process becomes less onerous and clearer to the licensing/approval  
or permitting officers. This facilitates the event-approval process and any  
safety advisory groups \(SAGs\) or experts who need to review the plan before  
the event begins. As we have found, over many years of teaching these mod-  
elling techniques, they are low-cost, low-skill operations and add enormous  
value to the process of understanding the key elements of crowd dynamics.  
Modelling  
Modelling is a process of discovery; with discovery comes understanding  
and understanding leads to better control systems. Discovery, understand-  
ing and control are the fundamental objectives of the crowd-modelling pro-  
cess. Often, the practice of building the crowd and event models help to  
identify and qualify the potential risk and can provide valuable insights,  
leading towards risk management solutions. To enable this, there are a few  
fundamental skills required.  
Competent person  
It is essential to understand the key skill necessary for competent event risk  
analysis and specifically in the process of creating and approving an event  
plan. Throughout this book, we have described the process of crowd and  
event modelling, and we have outlined the principles we developed, during  
many major projects of capturing and disseminating information relevant  
to crowd safety.  
Figure 8.1 shows the outline of the process from event concept, develop-  
ing an event/crowd management plan through to utilising the information  
in the control room. We have taught these principles for over a decade, we  
have found they are easily adopted into the planning and approval pro-  
cess, specifically as they are low-cost approach to the problem of crowd  
risk analysis and safety engineering. We stress that these are not academic  
exercises; they are built on experience of events large and small from around  
the world. Specifically, the DIM-ICE Meta model has proven to be a robust,  
structured, methodical and systematic approach to defining the key compo-  
nents of an event plan.  
We use this template for large and small events, from the 3 million pil-  
grims who perform complex rituals on the Jamarat Bridge during the annual  
pilgrimage to Mecca and for 500 neighbours and friends who attend our  
local village events. Some elements of the DIM-ICE Meta model require  
a lot of information, some have very little; for example, a fireworks event  
may have very little mid-event crowd movements as there is no circulation  
phase; others may have ingress and egress throughout the event placing dif-  
ferent types of demand on the entry/exit system. 234 Introduction to crowd science  
The DIM-ICE Meta model is a blank template for an event and com-  
pleting it is a process of assessing the elements of a crowd management  
plan, making sure that you have thought through all 18 components. This  
process was designed to ensure that the user has a template to complete  
and that the approval process has some method of assessing the overall  
content and quality of an event plan. The importance of understanding  
that an emergency can occur during ingress, during the event and during  
egress, here, the crowd, which is leaving the event, and providing con-  
tingency planning for all phases of the event is essential. The majority of  
accidents and incidents occur during ingress and egress and, as such, may  
have very different crowd management requirements than a mid-event  
emergency.  
We also outlined how RAMP analysis helps us define the safety con-  
cept. These four elements, routes, areas, movement and crowd profile, help  
us define the key components of the safety concept and again, by using a  
standardised template, we can introduce both a checklist to the approval  
process and a systematic method of defining the event-planning process.  
The table below outlines the components of the RAMP analysis.  
Routes Direction and distribution, modal split and factors that may impact routes  
Areas Static and moving spaces defining the site areas  
Movement The arrival and departure profile, coupling routes and areas to time  
Profile The crowd composition, type, demographic, history and communication  
elements  
When we work with police, safety advisory groups \(SAGs\), licensing  
officers and the crowd managers, the principle is simple and the advice  
is always the same; use the DIM-ICE/RAMP models and if you have any  
doubts about the validity or clarity of the event plan, reject it. The onus  
of responsibility is on the event organiser to demonstrate their event plan  
that is fit for its intended purpose. If in any doubt, the plan should be  
rejected. You should note that by approving a plan that fails, that was  
not fit for it intended purpose, you may be faced with prosecution for  
negligence.  
Applications  
We have demonstrated how the RAMP analysis and the DIM-ICE models  
are useful during the planning and approval phases of the event process. This  
does not over burden the process of risk analysis; it merely helps to define  
crowd risks in a way that the typical event professional can record and later  
process the information. The objective is to do so in such a way that a lay-  
person can pick up the plan and understand the key concepts, specifically The way forward 235  
relating to crowd risks. As we have outlined, the current risk\* analysis pro-  
cess, where the information is coded to a few lines, a number and a task des-  
ignator, does not lend itself to complete reconstruction of the potential risks.  
This implies that the process is open to interpretation and can be viewed by  
different people and indicates different actions and outcomes. Cleary, this is  
neither desirable nor precise enough for the required outcome, risk manage-  
ment. We need to stress that the existing risk assessment structure is per-  
fectly adequate for many fixed risks, risks that do not have variable functions  
\(such as density and flow\). However, the risks that are dynamic in nature the  
summary and numerical assignments are not capturing the relevant informa-  
tion. Specifically, if the location, duration and severity are variable, you need  
to consider how to highlight this information in the event plan, specifically  
in the crowd management plan. We are not aiming to replace this format,  
only to augment the existing risk analysis with diagrams that highlight the  
dynamic nature of risk assessment with respect to crowd safety.  
Crowd risk is dynamic  
There are three components to a dynamic risk. These are  
Location—Risk may be focussed at a specific location \(front of stage\)  
and may not manifest until the critical density/flow is reached.  
Duration—Risk may exist for a short time \(entry and exit systems\).  
Severity—Risk may have different levels of severity during the event and  
a single risk value is not sufficient to describe the risk.  
All of the above can be influenced by external influences, weather, trans-  
port delays and adverse media before or during the event, etc. There are  
many potential variables and we always recommend a study of past acci-  
dents and incidents, as they will provide a good insight into the nature of  
crowd accidents and incidents. Appendix B is a summary of major acci-  
dents and incidents, it is worth reading this to realise how widespread the  
problems of crowd risk analysis are around the world.  
EVENT PROCESS  
It is important to note that the three stages \(planning, approval and opera-  
tions\) are typical for major events, but they should be considered for all  
events, large and small. For example, a person or group draws up an event  
plan and another person or group, should then check the plan with an  
emphasis on risk analysis. The approval process may be conducted by an  
external person/group, for example, a safety advisory group \(SAG\), a local  
licensing authority or internally, by a competent person. Be aware that, if  
\*  
With respect to crowd risks. 236 Introduction to crowd science  
a defective event plan is approved then fails, the approving body may be  
scrutinised and held, to some extent, liable.  
There is a requirement for competency in creating the plan and a com-  
petency requirement for approving the plan. In any engineering discipline,  
the degree of competency will be related to the potential for harm. We do  
not see this in the event industry around the world. In our experience, many  
events are close to failure and, sadly, it takes a major incident before the  
situation will be addressed. By defining a modelling approach, one that is  
low cost and can be taught in a short course, we hope that we can expand  
the awareness of crowd risks in places of public assembly. We hope this  
will lead to a more methodical approach to crowd safety engineering; a  
more systematic and visual approach to the process of creating a crowd  
management plan. We can improve the awareness of risks for the event  
professional, the approval process requires similar skill sets to understand  
the event plan and check for any risks.  
Safety should not be compromised under any circumstances. The event  
may be run for financial gain, or to break even, in either case cost will be  
a consideration. If the cost of developing event plans appears to be high,  
consider the cost of litigation if someone is hurt at your event.  
There are a number of on-line resources and, if the event is large, consider  
using an external person/group who has no financial interest in the event  
plan, someone that is both competent and that is responsible for checking the  
validity of the plan and the safety concept, one that has the necessary skills to  
perform a comprehensive analysis. This is essential to ensure crowd safety for  
major events, but it is equally important where smaller events are considered.  
There are many smaller events where local authorities, such as the police  
and emergency services, have this experience. Checking your event plan  
with a local authority, such as the police, fire or ambulance service, will  
result in a dialogue between the event organiser and the development of a  
good future working relationships with the emergency services. Consider  
the process as illustrated in Figure 8.2 which shows the process from event  
concept through to event operations. A simpler diagram is shown in Figure  
8.3 \(planning, approval and operations\).  
The approval stage should comment and potentially reject an event plan  
unless they are completely satisfied that it is relatively safe to conduct. We  
should highlight that, in several cases, we have acted as an expert witness,  
and the approval authority passing a poor event plan, can result in prosecu-  
tion. If in doubt, the licensing authority should reject a plan unless it can  
be demonstrated to be as safe as possible to proceed.  
We have found that many emergency services are very happy, willing and  
able to participate in a discussion where the safety of the public is con-  
cerned. Their input can make a significant difference to event safety and we  
would advise, wherever possible, to talk to the emergency services and listen  
to their experience. It will improve your event and your knowledge of local The way forward 237

procedures. The larger the event, the more people you anticipate may attend  
the event; the more this process becomes a vital safeguard against incidents  
and, more importantly, the documentation will be scrutinised if there is an  
incident and may result in prosecution if found to be substandard.  
Expert analysis  
We have acted as an expert witness to a number of high-profile cases over  
the years and the first information we review is the event risk analysis and  
crowd management plan. Typically, we ask the same question in every case.  
Were the risks identified, documented, reviewed, reduced, managed or mit-  
igated and if not, then why not? Who had the job of identifying the risk?  
Would a reasonably competent person have identified these risks? Would a  
layperson have recognised these risks?  
You can see in all these types of questions the same themes of competence  
and negligence point towards liability on the part of the event planners and  
approval authorities. Without competent application of risk analysis and  
the appropriate documentation, it may be very difficult to prove otherwise.  
Could the accident have been avoided?  
One typical question is ‘at what point in time could the incident have been  
avoided’? Could this incident have been identified, and hence avoided, during  
planning and in the approval process? All these questions look to identifying  
the underlying cause of the incident and appropriating the blame on a specific  
individual or group of individuals. Again, this points towards negligence and  
to the event documentation, the crowd management plan and the crowd risk  
assessment process.  
As we stated in the opening chapter, not all events go to an approval pro-  
cess; there may be no external check on the validity of the event plan. That is  
why we have outlined the process from both the event planning and approval  
perspectives. We build models to provide a means of discovering crowd risks,  
and of understanding the potential for harm to the crowd under normal and  
emergency situations. Models help to inform the user of the nature, loca-  
tions, duration and severity of crowd risks. With the information produced  
during the process of modelling, we can introduce controls \(changes or man-  
agement processes\) in the design. We can introduce information systems that  
help inform the crowd of the potential for harm and thereby reduce or miti-  
gate these risks. If we cannot eliminate the risks, we may need to monitor and  
manage the crowd to ensure that the risk does not materialise.  
Event planning\: Flowchart  
As we outlined in the previous chapter, there are major projects for which  
a comprehensive approach to the entire scope of the design, build, value The way forward 239  
engineering, project cost analysis and resource deployment are a significant  
undertaking. For those types of projects, crowd simulations may be essen-  
tial to both understand the complexity of the site and the potential crowd  
risks. Clearly, we do not use that approach for all projects and many run  
on minimum budgets. For clients we would normally advise a three step  
approach to crowd and event modelling. Figure 8.4 shows the three levels  
of modelling that can be applied to projects, large or small. We are aware  
that many international consulting firms would convince a major client that  
massive simulation investment is required. That is not our approach; we  
always begin with a workshop, where the delegates are introduced to the  
principles and applications of crowd science. In many cases, these are suf-  
ficient to resovle the basic crowd management issues; in others, the delegates  
will engage us for further work. If you are considering either modelling or  
simulation for your event, then review the chart below and define what you  
need from an analysis. Level 1 is trainable and should be an internal func-  
tion. A workshop, or on-line training, would provide the necessary skills  
and should be considered as an investment for all future events. Level 2 is  
also a trainable set of skills and utilises the flow diagrams and risk mapping.  
Level 3 is advanced, this type of project would require a much higher level  
of skills, such as computer science, mathematics, simulation skills etc.

Level 1 type projects can be completed in a few days, Level 2 may take a  
week \(data collection, analysis\) but Level 3 type projects may take several  
months.  
Level 1\: Report and analysis  
Typically, the level 1 type of modelling exercise if based around clients who  
have some feeling that there is a potential problem, where a workshop based  
on their site or event, can be most effective in identifying the key issues. These  
are normally ‘reverse brief’ projects where the workshops format was specifi-  
cally designed to both educate the delegates on the key principles and appli-  
cations of crowd science and to allow them to outline their site problems.  
Many of these types of projects can be delivered remotely, via the Internet  
\(skype and email, reports in electronic format\), the client will provide event  
and crowd management plans, specify their issues and ask for varying degrees  
of assistance. We run a range of forums for an on-going discussion on crowd  
safety issues and a range of educational programmes around the world.  
The city of Austin is host to several mass gatherings that include music  
festivals, collegiate sporting events, and holiday celebrations. Dr.  
Still’s Crowd Science workshops provided tools and insights that will  
improve my ability to predict potential issues, create plans to address  
the predicted issues and manage the crowds that these events bring;  
ultimately creating safer events for our citizens. If you are responsible  
for the management of large gatherings, I would recommend this work-  
shop for you and your team.

Prof. Still’s workshop gave us valuable, specific, practical information  
that we could use in many different ways to improve our event. It was  
presented in a fantastic way using talks, videos, exercises, and discus-  
sions that really brought the group together. We had 30 people, half  
from our organization and half were various City first responders \(Fire,  
Police, EMS\). One of the best things that happened was getting to go  
through two three-day workshops with all of these people that you  
talk with for maybe 30 minutes at most. The team-building and con-  
nections that Prof. Still’s workshop offered were worth it on their own.  
But in addition a whole team of people got the knowledge and the lens  
through which to view crowd management and engagement in the most  
beneficial and practical way possible. It was fantastic.

Level 2\: Modelling and risk analysis  
These projects are hands-on, typically where we attend events and review  
the process from planning to operations. We would engage with the cli-  
ent to model their site, develop their risk assessment and work with the  
event professionals to improve real-time decision support. London New  
Year Events, and Wembley White Horse Bridge modelling were typical of  
this level of modelling.  
Keith Still’s crowd science courses and workshops have focussed the  
minds of many people in realising just how easy it can be for disaster to  
occur, and equally how simple the solutions often are.

Former Metropolitan Police Event Planner for Notting Hill Carnival  
and London New Year Events, 2010  
Level 3\: Complex analysis, value engineering, site  
and wide area simulation  
This level of modelling is the level where we need to potentially use com-  
puter simulations. Typically, a client would have attended a workshop, then  
worked with us on a site issue and then engaged with us for a site or wide  
area simulation. A typical example of this would be the Jamarat Bridge  
project and Canary Wharf real-time decision support system for multiple-  
building evacuations.  
I would like to express our sincere gratitude for your kind assistance in  
the Jamarat Bridge Project. The professional level of performance, the  
clarity of presentation and the solid results supported by scientific evi-  
dence were the main element of the success of our undertaking. We also  
appreciate the time you gave us during your visit to Saudi Arabia to  
train our staff, a gesture which proved to be of great benefit to all those  
involved in the project. While we look forward to your next visit to  
Jeddah for phase III of the project, we wish you a very fruitful future,  
as we’ve seen how your techniques are capable of solving a great num-  
ber of our planning problems, here in the Middle East, and especially  
in the Gulf area.

in evaluating our public areas for crowd control in a wide range of situ-  
ations. Prof. Still has an international reputation for developing mathe-  
matical models and solutions for various public events. In this case, we  
wanted a tool to provide a common basis for occupants of the Canary  
Wharf estate to develop compatible responses to various security and  
safety related incidents. While the Canary Wharf estate currently has  
60,000 staff employed in the development, a robust tool capable of  
dealing with crowds over 100,000 has been developed in conjunction  
with our major business tenants. We believe this innovative approach  
is another first for Canary Wharf and Prof. Still.

Figure 8.5 shows the cycle of information \(workshops, lectures, websites,

The workshops help the delegates understand the fundamental issues.  
Delegates are encouraged to bring along a case study, or site issue and we  
engage with them in the classroom environment, working with the models  
on their sites. We run a foundation degree module \(introduction to crowd  
science\) where the topics in this book are outlined and applied, where the  
delegates have to hand in an assignment demonstrating that they can apply  
the materials. We also run a BA \(Hons\) module as a workshop \(applied

The application element, where we work with site problems and major  
events, such as the Royal Wedding crowd management group, Jamarat

SXSW \(South by Southwest\) in the United States, would typically follow  
from workshops. The aim is to put these two courses online; so, distance  
learning, blended learning and consolidation of the principles and applica-  
tions of crowd science can extend.

Andre Gide  
We have presented a low-cost solution to a number of problems, relat-  
ing to the dynamics of crowd risks at major events. We hope that you have  
gained something useful from reading this book and will develop the prin-  
ciples and applications of crowd science further for your own events. As  
you will have observed, the DIM-ICE and risk analysis technique can be  
applied to planning, event licensing/approval/permitting and as an oper-  
ational aid for control rooms. These tools are already in use, for many  
events, large and small, around the world. We continue to run workshops  
for clients and teach at universities, working across the events industry and  
with the next generation of event managers.  
Our aim is to affect change in the industry, specifically to crowd manage-  
ment around the world. We hope you have enjoyed reading this material  
and that it will encourage you towards further research and development  
along similar low-cost lines. If you are planning an event, or already have  
event experience, we have a wealth of information, guidance documents,  
research materials and on-line teaching and training materials at www.

# mathematics  
INTRODUCTION  
There are only a few important calculations you need to consider for  
crowd safety. Start with the basic area and flow rate calculations \(a first  
pass approximation\). If the site fails a first pass approximation is should  
be rejected as ‘not fit for its intended purpose’. Below we highlight the key  
elements for a first pass approximation for crowd safety.  
SPACE  
The guidance indicates a value of two people per square metre as an event  
capacity. A first-pass approximation is to take the total area, then multiply  
by 2. This will give you the upper limit for the event space. So an area of  
12,000 square metres would have a maximum capacity of 24,000 people.  
We stress that this assumes all spaces are used within the event—so this is  
an approximation only. You then need to divide the event space into view-  
ing areas and areas where the crowds will be moving rather than standing.  
You also need to assess spaces that will not be used. We do this by putting  
a sheet of tracing paper over the site plan and highlighting these three types  
of space, Static, Dynamic and Unused. That diagram will be the template  
to decide whether there is sufficient space for the crowds.  
Depending on the crowd profile younger audiences have smaller frames  
and pack to a higher density. Older audiences can have larger frames \(body  
space\) so the packing density may be much lower. Buggies, children, back-  
packers and the like will all have an impact on crowd density limits. The  
value of 47 people in 10 square metres \(4.7 people per square metre\) has no  
reference to demographic—so it is not an absolute value \(guidance is as it is  
stated—guidance, not absolute\). You must assess the nature of the crowd,  
the packing density and define limits according to your event.  
Underutilised spaces should be excluded for a capacity analysis and  
spaces where the crowd are predominately moving \(such as entry and exit  
245 246 Appendix A  
points\) should be calculated at no more than two people per square metre  
\(these areas will experience some degree of congestion\). By assessing all of  
the above, you will have a better approximation for the utilised capacity.  
The area can be assessed using a range of free software, Google Earth,  
CAD or by dividing the event space into triangles. The area of a triangle is  
calculated by multiplying the base by the height, and then dividing by 2. There  
are numerous web resources that illustrate the different types of triangles,  
for example, http\://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/vol1/area\_triangle.html.  
TIME  
One of the best methods of assessing crowd build up is to draw a graph of  
number of people against time. The vertical access should be number of  
people and the horizontal axis \(from left to right\) should be time. You can  
use this to monitor crowd build up, assessing density, or if you are count-  
ing, you can plot the counts. There are a few techniques that you can use  
to assess how this graph may develop. For example if you take a ruler and  
place it along the points of the graph—the future numbers of people can be  
assessed along the horizontal of the graph and edge of the ruler.  
DIRECTION  
We always recommend you to assess the transport hubs \(car and coach  
parks, train or tram stations, bus stops\) and local population areas, for  
example, a pub/bar prior to an event, could be a source of a number of  
people leaving the pub/bar and heading to the event. Directions can pro-  
vide useful clues to potential crowd issues. We ran a workshop for a major  
city/park event where one of the main approach routes passed a number of  
liquor stores \(in the UK we call these off-licences, shops that sell alcohol\)  
and supermarkets, where alcohol would be sold in bottles. The event was  
advertised with a policy of no glass. Clearly, the combination of selling  
glass bottles then having them confiscated at the entry point would lead  
to potential problems. By assessing the routes and potential problems, the  
decision to relax the policy or to work with the local businesses, to sell only  
plastic containers, or decanting facilities, could be made.  
FLOW  
Flow rates are normally worked out to be taking the width of a route and  
multiplying by 82 to get the best case \(maximum\) crowd flow \(for a nor-  
mal crowd\). So, when assessing a crowd flow, look to the smallest width Appendix A 247  
along the route. Measure that width and multiply the width by 82 \(people  
per metre per minute\) to obtain the upper flow rates. This is a first-pass  
approximation and the crowd flow is unlikely to exceed this value. For  
example, if the road is 10 m wide the flow rate would be 820 people per  
minute. Multiply by 60 to get people per hour  
=  
49,200 people per hour.  
We can see by this simple example that a 10 m width would allow approx-  
imately 50,000 people per hour \(again this is a normal type of crowd\). You  
need to scale this down if there are back packers, children, mixed young  
and elderly family groups, buggies, mobility impaired and/or picnic ham-  
pers. The upper limit is 82 people per metre per minute. We generally evalu-  
ate movement at this \(best possible case\) then scale down for the crowd  
demographic makeup. For example, if the crowd is tired, of mixed ability  
\(young/old\) then scale down the flow rates.  
If you are unsure of your crowd flow, measure it. Measure the width  
of the road. Count the people passing a line across that road in a minute.  
That will give you the people per width per minute. Divide by the width  
of the road and you will have a value of people per metre per minute. For  
example, if the road is 12 metres wide and you have counted \(e.g. use a  
clicker\) 840 people passing in a minute then the flow rate is 840 divided by  
12  
=  
75 people per metre per minute.  
Note\: Not all of the route will be used—there will be spaces left between  
the crowd and the walls. It’s normal to allow 50 cm each side of the route  
for this factor. You should also allow for street furniture and take the effec-  
tive width. So, if you have measured 12 m wide on the road—but there are  
lampposts then we would use 12 m – \(50 cm + 50 cm for the sides\)  
=  
11 m.  
Then deduct a further 50 cm for the lampposts—giving an effective width  
of only 10.5 m. Counting 840 people would therefore give you a flow rate  
of 840/10.5  
=  
80 people per metre per minute.  
We stress that these are optimal flow rates and should only be used to  
approximate rates of passage. In all of the examples, this is a first pass  
approximation, there are many variables that can influence crowd flow—  
but you must start with some fundamental values to be able to assess the  
risk to the crowd and avoid over crowding/crushing. Appendix B\: The disaster database  
INTRODUCTION  
Accidents do not just happen; there is always a cause! Whether there was  
an underlying lack of safety culture, poor understanding of the overwhelm-  
ing forces involved in crowd dynamics and design limits/capacity/through-  
put or mismanagement, there is always an underlying cause. We identified  
three underlying \(root/distal\) causes\: design based, information related or  
management \(human\) failure. Using these classifications, we categorised  
the historic accidents/incidents into three fundamental problems\: design  
problems, information problems and management problems.  
One of the key elements of crowd modelling is to understand the capacity  
of the space, how quickly it will fill and what time it will take to reach criti-  
cal density. This does not need complex computer simulations as simple,  
first-pass capacity analysis gives us clear indications whether a system will  
work \(or needs a radical design change\). If a system fails a first-pass analysis  
\(sometimes called a rough-cut capacity analysis\), then reject it as ‘not fit for  
purpose’. Even with queueing systems in place, whenever crowds can arrive  
in numbers that may exceed a systems capacity there is a risk. Identifying  
the nature, duration and scale of that risk is relatively simple maths.  
The following pages are from a wide range of press headlines and brief  
outlines of some of the disasters recorded. A more comprehensive list is

over 150 injured following a first-division game between River Plate  
and Boca Juniors when fans trying to leave the stadium mistakenly  
head towards a closed exit and are crushed against the doors by other  
fans unaware of the closed passageway.  
1971 \(2 January\) Glasgow, Scotland. 66 people are killed and 140  
are injured when barriers in Ibrox Stadium collapse near the end of a  
match between Celtic and Rangers and fans are crushed.  
1971 \(4 March\) Salvador, Brazil. A fight and a wild rush broke out in  
the grandstands, killing four and injuring 1500.  
1974 \(17 February\) Cairo, Egypt. Crowds attempting to enter a club  
game broke down barriers and 49 people were trampled to death.  
1975 \(12 March\) the USSR, Moscow. Sokolniki stadium\: after a soc-  
cer game between a Canadian and a USSR youth team, 20 people  
were crushed to death in a dark stairway.  
1976 \(6 December\) Port-au-Prince, Haiti. At a World Cup qualifier  
between Haiti and Cuba, the visitors scored and a Haitian fan set off a  
firecracker. Fans thought it was gunfire and panicked, knocking down a  
soldier, whose gun went off and killed a small boy and girl in the crowd.  
1979 Nigeria. 24 died and 27 injured in a stampede as fans stampede  
during a light failure.  
1981 \(8 February\) Piraeus, Greece. 24 died in a stampede as fans  
rush to leave ground, 54 injured.  
1981 Sheffield, Great Britain. 38 injured during a crowd surge at  
Hillsborough Stadium.  
1982 \(20 October\) Moscow. 340 are reportedly killed at a European  
Cup match between Soviet club Spartak Moscow and Haarlem of  
the Netherlands. Police are blamed for pushing fans down a narrow,  
icy staircase before the end of the match. When a late goal is scored,  
exiting fans try to re-enter the stadium and create a ‘human mincer’.  
Moscow officials dispute the claims made in the publication of the  
Soviet Sports Committee, saying only 61 died and police did not push  
fans. Luzhniki Stadium\: Up to 340 people are crushed to death when  
fans leaving the stadium try to re-enter the stands after a last-minute  
goal in a UEFA Cup tie between Moscow Spartak and Dutch side  
Haarlem, according to Sovietsky Sport. The government newspaper  
Izvestia puts the death toll at 66. Appendix B 251

into a stadium.  
1985 \(29 May\) Brussels, Belgium. 39 people are killed at the European  
Champions Cup Final at Heysel Stadium when riots beak out and a  
wall separating rival fans of England’s Liverpool and Italy’s Juventus  
of Turin collapses.  
1987 \(10 March\) Tripoli, Libya. 20 people are killed when panic-stricken  
fans flee knife-wielding ruffians and trigger the collapse of a wall. \(This  
report conflicted with those from the Libyan state news agency JANA,  
which said two people were killed and 16 were hospitalised.\)  
1988 \(12 March\) Katmandu, Nepal. At least 93 people are killed and  
more than 100 injured when fans fleeing a hailstorm stampede into  
locked stadium exits.  
1989 \(15 April\) Hillsborough, Sheffield, England. 96 people are  
crushed to death \(1 died in hospital with crush-related injuries\) at an  
English FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham  
Forest, when police open gates to alleviate crowding outside  
Hillsborough Stadium. The resulting rush of people onto the already  
filled terrace sections traps fans against riot control fences ringing the  
field. 400 injured.  
1990 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
Mina Valley, Saudi Arabia. 1426 die in an accident at the Muslim  
pilgrims converging on Al-Mu’aysam Tunnel. The pilgrims, 680 of  
whom were later identified as Indonesian and some 600 as Turkish,  
died of suffocation or were trampled to death in a frantic attempt  
to escape, as an estimated 50,000 worshippers converged simultane-  
ously on the 500-m long Al-Mu’aysam tunnel to the pilgrim tent city  
of Mina towards Jamarat Bridge.  
1991 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
13 January, Orkney, South Africa. At least 40 people are killed, most  
of them trampled or crushed along riot-control fences that surround  
the field, when fans panic and try to escape brawls that break out  
in the grandstand. 40 killed and 50 injured in South Africa’s worst  
sports disaster. A refereeing decision triggered violence and a stam-  
pede during a pre-season ‘friendly’ between arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs  
and Orlando Pirates. 252 Appendix B  
•  
July Nairobi, Kenya. 1 fan killed and 24 injured in a stampede during  
an African Nations Cup qualifier between Kenya and Mozambique.  
1992 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
•  
5 May, Bastia, Corsica. 17 people are killed and 1900 injured when a  
temporary grandstand, erected to increase the capacity of the stadium  
from 8500 to 18,000, collapses before a French Cup semi-final match  
between four-time defending league champion Olympique Marseille  
and second-division Bastia.  
19 July, Rio de Janerio. 50 injured falling 5 m from the upper tier  
of the Maracana Stadium when part of the fencing gave way when  
150,000 fans await the Brazilian championship final match between  
Flamengo and Botafogo.  
1993 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
1 January, Lan Kwai Fong, Hong Kong. 21 died in crowd crush inci-  
dent. The Lan Kwai Fong disaster that took place in Hong Kong in  
the early hours of 1 January 1993. It was a crush crowd incident,  
catching thousands of party-goers off-guard and resulted in 21 per-  
sons dying. The location \(narrow streets and a sloped gradient\), poor  
police planning and bad weather contributed to the disaster. From  
Mr Justice Bokary’s Interim Report into that disaster, it was stated  
that a number of persons, more or less in a row and more or less at the  
same time, lost or were deprived of their footing and fell. Because the  
press from behind was overwhelming, more and more people started  
falling. People piled upon those who had gone down before them. The  
pile grew until it reached such a height that the people immediately  
behind it were propped up by it and pinned against it by the press  
people behind and upslope of them. Thus came about what some wit-  
nesses have called a ‘human wall’. Tragically, men, women and chil-  
dren had the breath of life crushed out of them. 20 persons died very  
quickly, one more died in hospital some days later.  
1994 CROWD DISASTERS  
Saudi Arabia. 266 died 98 injured in a progressive crowd collapse dur-  
ing ‘stoning the devil’ ritual at the Jamarat Bridge. In ALL incidents Appendix B 253  
at Jamarat, the crushing is a progressive crowd collapse caused by the sheer  
numbers of pilgrims.  
1995 CROWD DISASTERS  
8 April, Sierra Leone, Freetown. The main gate collapsed on hundreds of  
fans scrambling for tickets outside a packed stadium, at least 40 people  
were injured.

•  
16 June, Lusaka, Zambia. Nine soccer fans were crushed to death  
and 78 others injured during a stampede following Zambia’s victory  
over Sudan in a World Cup qualifying game.  
14 July, Tripoli, Libya. A riot at a soccer match involving a team  
controlled by the son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi killed or  
injured up to 50 people. No exact figures were reported in the Libyan-  
controlled press.  
16 October, Guatemala City. At least 83 people died and about 180  
others were injured during a stampede at a stadium before a World  
Cup qualifying match between Guatemala and Costa Rica.  
1997 CROWD DISASTERS  
Jamarat Bridge, Saudi Arabia. 22 dead, 43 injured, Muslim pilgrims  
crushed.  
1998 CROWD DISASTERS  
Jamarat Bridge, Saudi Arabia. 118 Muslim pilgrims crushed, 434 injured.  
We have the complete details of this and other Jamarat-related incidents  
and the press like to report ‘stampede’ or ‘panic’.  
1999 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
11 January, Egypt, Alexandria. Stampede after a derby between Korm  
and Al Ittihad, 11 people died. 254 Appendix B  
•  
31 May, Minsk, Belarus. 53 dead, 150 injured, 78 hospitalised when  
a crowd of 2500 rushed to get out of the rain at the railway station.  
From The Daily Telegraph, 1 June 1999. An unprecedented tragedy  
happened on 30 May in the centre of the Belarusian capital. Over 50  
people died and some 300 were wounded in a crush at the entrance to  
the underground station … The tragedy was caused by heavy rain that  
started at about 8 p.m. … A few thousand Minsk residents, mostly  
young people, had gathered …The first thunders and rain drops made  
people rush to find shelter in the underground crossing … Somebody  
fell down on the concrete floor and the first blood was shed. People  
were slipping over and trampling those lying on the floor … People  
were falling at the feet of the crowd. Over 2000 people poured into  
the 10-m wide underground crossing thus creating a dense moving  
jam … there were people literally smeared against the walls, pressed  
into the floor,…Meanwhile, screams of those who were unable to  
escape on their own kept echoing from this hellish meat grinder…  
‘We are soccer fans, so we know what to do in a crowd—cover your  
head with hands and make your way to the exit’.… ‘People kept arriv-  
ing until there was almost no space and then the whole mess started.  
There was no escape. The people surging in from behind just left the  
others lying and walked over them’, one of the survivors told Russian  
television. ‘About 300 people were lying here, one layer on top of  
another’, a policeman said, ‘We were carrying out the top layer of  
people and they were still alive. Those in the bottom layer were either  
dead or injured’. Two policemen were caught in the crush and also  
died as they tried to rescue those who had fallen … More than 150  
people were taken to 10 hospitals in Minsk as doctors battled through  
the night to save the lives of the victims in the tragedy. In his speech,  
president Lukashenko said\: ‘There is nobody to blame, there is no one  
to make a claim to, it happened because it happened, even if there was  
anybody responsible it was the rain that caused the disaster’.

23 April, Monrovia, Liberia. At least three reported dead and others  
injured as thousands of fans forced their way into an overcrowded  
stadium for a World Cup qualifier between Liberia and Chad.  
8 July, Harare, Zimbabwe. Thirteen people die after a stampede at  
World Cup qualifier between South Africa and Zimbabwe. The sta-  
dium was filled to capacity with spectators. Towards the end of the  
match, some spectators started to throw cans and mostly plastic bot-  
tles onto the pitch after the South Africans had scored their second Appendix B 255

goal. The police responded by firing into the crowded stands a large  
number of tear gas canisters. Among those killed in the stampede  
were four children, the youngest aged 5.  
July, Roskilde Festival, Denmark. 26 people injured and 9 died at a  
concert \(Pearl Jam\) when crowds slip and fall in mud in front of the  
stage.  
December, São Januário Stadium, Brazil. Approximately 200 were  
hurt in a crowd crush incident in the stands of the São Januário sta-  
dium during a Brazilian soccer championship match. According to  
reports, the stadium was visibly oversold, but organisers did not notify  
safety officials. Many fans were trapped by security fencing and could  
not escape.  
April, Portugal, Lisbon. Luanda nightclub\: release of pepper gas and  
power cut caused a panicked stampede by at least 500 people, 7 per-  
sons died, 60 were injured.

11 April, Ellis Park, South Africa. At least 43 people were killed  
at a football match between South Africa’s two biggest teams. The  
stampede began as a crowd tried to get into Ellis Park stadium in  
Johannesburg to watch the match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando  
Pirates.  
29 April, Lubumbashi, Congo. Another stampede killed eight people.  
March, Jakarta, Indonesia. Four young girls crushed to death during  
signing session of British Band A1 during mall promotion.  
April, Scores Killed in Pakistani Crowd Crush. At least 36 Muslim  
pilgrims in Pakistan died when they were crushed to death in a crowd  
of approximately 100,000 people. Approximately 150 people were  
also treated for crowd crush injuries at the scene or in hospitals. A  
door opening delay that kept pilgrims waiting for three hours; a nar-  
row street that funnelled the worshipers into the shrine and poor  
crowd management were reasons given for the disaster.  
6 May, Ivory Coast. Fighting broke out among fans at a match in  
Ivory Coast, killing 1 person and injuring 39.  
9 May, Ghana, West Africa. A stampede at a packed soccer match  
between two of Ghana’s leading teams killed at least 100 people.  
July, Akashi Crowd Crush Disaster. Preliminary Analysis Points to  
Poor Planning and Management. 10 people were killed and over 120  
were injured. Eight of the ten victims were under the age of 10. Two 256 Appendix B

•  
were in their 70s, according to the Kyodo News. The victims were  
part of a crowd of well over 150,000 people who were enjoying a  
fireworks display nearby. Among the major crowd safety flaws that  
led to the crowd crush and crowd collapse disaster are, according to  
CMS \(the USA\)\: \(1\) Reliance by organisers on one major egress route  
for tens of thousands of people. \(2\) Reliance on an egress route not  
designed for the crowd capacity that could reasonably be expected  
to use the exit route following the fireworks display. \(3\) An underes-  
timation of the anticipated event audience size. Therefore, an under  
assessment of the staffing, services and demands that would be placed  
upon the event site. \(4\) A lack of emergency exits on the walkway. \(5\)  
A flawed, poorly executed or non-existent emergency plan. \(6\) Failure  
of a timely response to the initial signs of impending disaster.  
August. Forty-five fans had to receive medical treatment after they  
were crushed at a concert featuring Eminem. They were crushed  
20 min after the Detroit rapper came on stage at the Gig on the Green  
festival in Glasgow. Before the rapper appeared on stage, announce-  
ments had been made by festival organisers asking people to stop  
surging forward.  
18 December, Aracaju, Brazil. Free Christmas gift distribution creates  
crush and death. Four people died, including three children, when a  
poorly planned and managed government-sponsored Christmas gift  
giveaway program for children went awry in Aracaju, Brazil. Around  
40,000 to 45,000 people showed up at a public building for the holiday  
event, approximately the crowd size anticipated. Tens of thousands of  
people waiting to receive their free gifts were caught in a craze when  
one of the main gates opened triggering a surge and crush, according  
to local news reports. In spite of the deaths, government authorities  
continued the distribution of toys, after order was restored.  
22 December, Sofia, Bulgaria. Seven pre-teens and teens died in a  
crowd trampling in Sofia, Bulgaria, on Friday night. Approximately  
1000 to 1500 young people were waiting to enter the already crowded  
club when the entrance doors were ‘suddenly’ opened. President-elect  
Georgi Parnanov told the AFP news wire, ‘Conditions in the disco  
were primitive and this incident should have been foreseen’.  
2002 CROWD DISASTERS  
•  
8 January. 10 injured. The Tama Plaza Tokyu Shopping Centre in  
Yokohama, Japan, thought they had a good publicity stunt for the  
first day of the new year. A promotion-offering ‘lucky bags’ \(‘fukubu-  
kuro’\) containing merchandise more valuable than their retail price  
were offered to the public by the shopping centre on New Year’s day. Appendix B 257  
•  
As a result, a large crowd lined up at the shopping centre to obtain the  
specially priced bags.  
24 September. Twenty-one children were killed, most suffocated  
under a pile of bodies, and 47 hurt when a guardrail gave way in a  
dark stairwell at a Chinese school during a power blackout, hospital  
officials said on Tuesday. Police said they had detained seven people,  
including school officials and a local construction company boss,  
after the collapse.

18 February, Chicago, the USA. At least 21 people have been killed  
and several others critically injured in a scramble to flee a crowded  
Chicago nightclub after someone released pepper spray or mace.  
People were reportedly trampled in a rush for the door at the two-  
storey Epitome Night Club.  
14 May. At least 15 concertgoers were killed in a crowd crush near the  
front of the stage at a pop concert at Friendship Stadium in Cotonou,  
Benin. The promoter did not notify local police of the crowd man-  
agement tragedy until after the concert for fear of it being cancelled,  
according to a report by the BBC. Authorities say there will be an  
investigation.  
27 August. At least 32 dead in Hindu pilgrim stampede. The tragedy  
happened on Wednesday as thousands of pilgrims pushed and shoved  
along a narrow lane to a bathing pond on the banks of the Godavari  
river at Nasik in Western India.

Muslims were killed in a stampede during the annual haj pilgrimage.  
5 February, Beijing. Festival disaster kills 37 Beijing \(Reuters\). At  
least 37 people have been killed and 15 injured at a lantern festival  
in a north suburb of the Chinese capital. The Chinese Lunar New  
Year lantern and fireworks display ended in disaster when spectators  
packed on a metal bridge died in a crush.

Legal disclaimer Appendix D\: DIM-ICE meta model  
# \(summary\)  
INTRODUCTION  
This section is a short summary of the DIM-ICE Meta model included here  
as a reference guide for the practitioner.  
Event influences and crowd behaviour  
There are three main influences on crowd behaviour \(design, information  
and management\) and three main phases of crowd behaviour. During each  
phase, we need to plan for both normal and emergency considerations.  
This is a combination of 18 elements which, when mapped into a matrix,  
provides a unique overview of the event.  
Influences on crowd behaviour  
The three primary influences \(design, information and management\) are as  
follows\:  
Design \(D\)\: The crowd will manoeuvre through the built and complex  
spaces interacting with the local geometry, barriers, walls, doors, bridges  
and the like. It is important to calculate capacity and flow/fill rates and  
their influences on the crowd behaviour. How a barrier design or layout  
functions during ingress needs contingency planning for an emergency dur-  
ing ingress. For example, entry queueing systems, queueing spaces \(both on  
entry and during the event at concessions\) need to be matched to the arrival  
profiles \(the arriving crowds over time\). This is important when consider-  
ing the impact inefficient queueing systems can have on crowd behaviour.  
Egress capacity on exit, location and distribution of the crowd, specif-  
ically queueing at the transport terminals \(bus/trains\) and car park exit  
gates, are all part of the design element of the model. The event does not  
finish at the event site boundaries. Meta modelling considers the point of  
arrival \(transport systems\) to the point of departure \(the transport system\).  
269 270 Appendix D  
Information \(I\)\: Signage, p.a. announcements \(such as big screens, text  
updates, stewards, loud hailers, etc.\), advanced notifications, local and  
national media all influence the crowd behaviour. We map all these influ-  
ences to assist the overall crowd management strategy and help shape the  
crowd behaviour arriving, during and departing the site. This dimension  
takes into account the advanced notification and planning aspects of site  
design and have specific focus on how information systems affect behaviour.  
Management \(M\)\: Stewarding, policing and event timing \(key per-  
formers, overrunning allotted times\) can all affect the crowd behaviour.  
Specifically monitoring the crowd and using that information in an over-  
arching crowd management strategy is the purpose of the meta-model. For  
example, it is important to differentiate between a crowd management plan  
and a security, policing and stewarding plan. These have different func-  
tions and different resource deployments.  
Three principle phases of events  
Ingress \(I\) behaviour\: Where the crowd is arriving in anticipation of get-  
ting a good vantage point for the event is the first phase. Primarily seeking  
information/signage to direct them to their position, orienting them to the  
site and the event is important in reducing the typical frustrations in the  
crowd. It is important to assess the arrival profile for an event to ensure  
adequate and safe ingress capacity \(search process, ticket checking, etc.\)  
Circulation \(C\) behaviour\: During the event, the facilities planning and  
layout can influence crowd behaviour. Excessive queueing for toilets, facili-  
ties, food and beverage affects the crowd dynamics and the success of an  
event can often depend on how accessible these elements are during an  
event. You should quantify and monitor crowd behaviour, capacity and  
crowd density at key locations, such as the front of a stage.  
Egress \(E\) behaviour\: Typically the crowd dynamics during egress is to  
leave as quickly as possible. However, this can lead to anxiety, and aggres-  
sion \(e.g. car park management is an example of the kind of frustrations  
exhibited during egress\). Excessive loading on transportation systems \(trains,  
busses, etc.\) is an important consideration for the crowd management plan.  
There are two non-emergency, egress profiles to consider for an event.  
These are typically referred to as a hard and soft finishes. This has a signifi-  
cant impact on the crowds departing the event and the subsequent loading  
on the egress/transport system.  
At the end of the event  
There are two different types of events, those that finish at a fixed time  
\(hard finish\) and those that have no fixed ending and crowds drift away  
across a longer period \(soft finish\). Appendix D 271  
Hard finish\: Is defined where everyone leaves very shortly after the event  
concludes, for example, a firework display or a concert.  
Soft finish\: After the main performer at a concert, exhibition, parade,  
street carnival and so forth, secondary entertainments may typically be  
used to affect the crowd departure profile. This has the effect on the crowd  
leaving over an extended period of time. It is important to define the depar-  
ture period to ensure adequate and safe egress and balancing that to the  
transport loading.  
Both hard and soft finishes to events can have risks. We highlight that the  
event does NOT finish at the event boundary. Analysis of risk should also  
extend to transport interfaces. Although this sounds like a lot of potential  
combinations, when we outline the meta-model in a template \(see below\)  
the model becomes clear—it’s a template for developing a comprehensive  
crowd management plan.

Once you have a template for a number of events, you begin to capture  
important information, such as different types of design, how they work  
under normal and emergency situations, most importantly it becomes a  
systematic method of assessing risks to the public under your charge.  
Risk analysis  
The three key elements of risk analysis are to determine the likelihood and  
consequence of a risk, to describe that risk and to outline an action plan to  
eliminate, mitigate or manage the risk. We will outline this in the context  
of the DIM-ICE Meta model. The first part of this process requires a sys-  
tematic approach to identifying risk during ingress. Work through design,  
information and management aspects in the column for ingress, completing  
the template. Think about normal and emergency situations. Then move  
onto the next column and think about the circulation \(mid-event\) phase,  
design, information, management, normal and emergency situations and  
then repeat for the egress phase. Below is a typical outline, of course you  
need to create a document that states each element and supplement these  
with appropriate diagrams.  
Normal Ingress Circulation Egress  
Design Elements of the design that  
influence the crowd during  
ingress—this specifically  
relates to the elements of the  
design \(such as barriers, local  
geometry, widths of routes,  
paths and stairs, entrances,  
turnstiles, etc.\)  
Information  
Prior to the event, a lot of  
things can influence the  
crowd behaviour such as  
advanced notifications, media  
coverage, tickets and posters,  
local knowledge, previous  
event history, nature of band  
and weather forecasts. Assess  
how the information prior to  
the event, near the event, on  
the way to the event and at  
the venue could influence the  
crowd—specifically signage  
and information systems.  
Elements of the  
design that influence  
the crowd during  
the circulation \(this  
relates to ‘mid-  
event’—moving  
around\) such as  
route widths, stairs,  
layout and facilities  
management,  
concessions, etc.  
Mid-event there can  
be a lot of  
conflicting  
information, the  
performance, the  
concessions, signage,  
PA announcements,  
stewards,  
information points.  
Assess how this  
influences the  
crowds and how  
best to inform the  
crowd of the  
facilities.  
Elements of the  
design that  
influence the  
crowd during  
egress \(getting  
out\)—specifically  
the egress capacity,  
route complexity  
and geometry  
\(stairs, corridors,  
doors, gates, etc.\)  
Signage and PA  
announcements  
for departure  
\(non-emergencies\)  
influence not only  
the direction but  
the distribution of  
the crowd. Ensure  
that all routes are  
clearly signed—  
checking for lines  
of sight to ensure  
all exit routes are  
visible. Appendix D 273  
Normal Ingress Circulation Egress  
Management  
Stewards, security and police  
management can divert the  
crowd to the most  
appropriate areas but they  
ALSO influence the crowds  
behaviour \(such as reducing  
the element of hooliganism by  
increasing the visibility of  
police—this is ALSO  
information\). We typically  
consider the deployment and  
activities of active  
management in this section.  
Queues can be actively  
managed and evenly  
distributed if approach routes  
do not allow good sightlines.  
During the event, the  
stewards can actively  
manage queues and  
crowd movements.  
During egress,  
departing crowds  
can be actively  
managed—  
specifically car  
parks can be made  
more efficient if  
actively managed  
\(rather than  
allowing a  
free-for-all dash for  
exit\).  
One good idea to incorporate in the above is to colour each section red/  
orange/green\* to indicate if there is a high, medium or low risk for each  
phase/influence. This can then be mapped to a site plan providing further  
explanation of the risk, its location, duration and severity. You can outline  
the physical area of the risk, the time \(start/end, i.e. duration\), the intensity/  
severity of the risk in a single diagram. Situations may change through time  
and your models need to reflect these changes. To begin with, you need to  
think about how your crowd and venue change through time. You need  
draw different sketches for each of those changes, perhaps for each hour of  
your event. You only need three colours\: red, amber and green. Red rep-  
resents danger, green is safe and amber is something you need to monitor.  
Remember, you only need a simple diagram that anyone you give it to can  
understand. Simplify, simplify, simplify.  
Although this sounds like more work, it is a quick, low-cost and informa-  
tive process. The important point to note is that an approval process may  
not have seen the site or event and all the relevant information needs to be  
in the event plan.

A well-grounded and practical guide, **Introduction to Crowd Science** highlights  
the underlying causes of crowd disasters and mass fatalities—giving the reader a  
unique insight into crowd-related accidents. This book presents a clearer under-  
standing of crowd risks and provides the reader with a range of simple modelling  
techniques to plan and manage places of public assembly, leading to clear improve-  
ments in crowd safety.  
It is written for students and professionals in a number of areas such as event  
organisation and management and the police and emergency services. It is focused  
on principles independent of any particular software and heavily illustrated with  
examples from practice, both good and bad.
